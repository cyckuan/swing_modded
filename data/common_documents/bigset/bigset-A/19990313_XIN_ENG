<HEADLINE> Zhuhai Promises Uninterrupted Waster Supply for Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The south China city of Zhuhai
today promised to ensure an uninterrupted water supply for Macao
in spite of facing one of the most critical water shortages in
history.
</P>
<P>
Lei Yulan, deputy secretary of Zhuhai City Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC), said today that Zhuhai would spare
no effort to guarantee fresh water supply for Macao.
</P>
<P>
Zhuhai has been in the grips of serious drought over the past
six months, with a sharp drop in water levels in local reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
Weather forecasts indicate that no meaningful rainfall
accumulation is expected in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The city government plans to introduce compulsory water
conservation measures if lack of rain continues over the next few
weeks. Local residents have been encouraged to use water sparingly
in order to ensure Macao's water supply.
</P>
<P>
Zhuhai has supplied water to Macao since the 1960s. Four Zhuhai
reservoirs supply Macao's 150,000 cu.m. daily demand for water.
</P>
<P>
Local officials recently inspected water resources and pledged
that the city will guarantee water quality.
</P>
<P>
Zhuhai has allocated 250 million yuan (30 million US dollars)
to build a pumping station with designed daily water supply
capacity of 1.5 million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Relevant departments are monitoring water reserves and are
ready to pipe water from the nearby city of Zhongshan.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Denies Nuke Cooperation With DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Friday categorically
denounced a report of the Washington Times that Pakistan is
helping the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to set up
uranium enrichment capability.
</P>
<P>
Describing the report as "false and tendentious," a spokesman
for the Pakistani Foreign Office stated that the purpose of the
speculative report was "none other than to malign Pakistan and
create unfounded misgivings and concerns about Pakistan's nuclear
program."
</P>
<P>
He categorically denied any cooperation, whatsoever, between
Pakistan and the DPRK in the nuclear area.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also reiterated that it is Pakistan's long-term
and abiding policy not to transfer sensitive nuclear technology to
any country.
</P>
<P>
"This policy commitment has been maintained by Pakistan
unilaterally since the early 1980s when it was able to develop
nuclear capability," he said.
</P>
<P>
"On this score, Pakistan has all along acted with the highest
sense of responsibility and its record has been impeccable," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that Pakistan is engaged in an intensive
dialogue with the United States as well as other major powers on
nuclear-related issues including measures for tightening nuclear
export control.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has given assurance to take all necessary measures to
ensure against transfer of sensitive nuclear technology to any
country, he said.

MOSCOW, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Neither NATO troops nor nuclear
weapons will be deployed in Poland upon its admission to the
alliance, Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski told a Russian
newspaper Friday.
</P>
<P>
Poland, along with Hungary and the Czech Republic, will
officially join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Friday at a
ceremony in the U.S. town of Independence, Missouri.
</P>
<P>
Kwasniewski told the Izvestia newspaper that Poland will
continue its reduction of troops from 240,000 to 180,000 and the
cut in the duration of mandatory military service to one year.
</P>
<P>
On Poland's ties with Russia, Kwasniewski said "a lot has been
lost from the rich potential previously amassed" but that the
situation can be rectified, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Kwasniewski noted with satisfaction the revival of bilateral
dialogue, adding that Warsaw is looking forward to Russian Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov's upcoming visit to Poland.
</P>
<P>
He said the invitation to Russian President Boris Yeltsin to
make an official visit to Warsaw remains in effect.
</P>
<P>
Kwasniewsky said he hopes Yeltsin's visit will materialize and
that it "would become a turning point at this stage of our history
and give a new impetus to the development of diverse ties."

<HEADLINE> Belgrade Rejects Foreign Military Presence in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic has firmly and resolutely rejected any possibility of a
multinational military or police operation in Kosovo, Russian
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov, who met with Milosevic earlier Friday, told reporters
in Belgrade the Yugoslav authorities "are guided by the belief
that they can, jointly with an OSCE observation mission in Kosovo,
ensure the implementation of the agreements which are expected to
be reached in Paris," Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov quoted Milosevic as saying that "the Yugoslav delegation
will arrive in Paris on March 15 to continue the talks with the
Kosovo Albanians."
</P>
<P>
"In Belgrade's opinion, the political document drafted on the
basis of the talks in Rambouillet (France) will lay a solid
foundation for reaching political agreements on granting broad
autonomy to Kosovo with the strict observance of the sovereignty
and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that after the talks in Rambouillet,
a political document along with two supplements on military and
police implementation of the future agreements were offered to the
negotiating parties by the Contact Group.
</P>
<P>
Russia is a member of the six-nation Contact Group on former
Yugoslavia, which also includes Britain, France, Germany, Italy
and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said the supplements "were proposed by individual
members of the Contact Group" but Moscow believes a political
document should be signed first, and that "the parameters of its
implementation should be discussed afterwards."
</P>
<P>
"All members of the Contact Group understand that neither a
military nor a police operation can be carried out in Kosovo
without Belgrade's consent," Ivanov added.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia, Russia Sign Economic Cooperation Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia and Russia Friday
signed a cooperation agreement in the economic and trade sector
aimed at increasing two-way trade.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Industry and Trade Minister Rahardi Ramelan said
after signing the agreement with his Russian counterpart Geogry V.
Gabuniya that the agreement covered economic and technical
cooperation and avoidance of double taxation, official Antara News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the two countries would soon establish an
Indonesia-Russia Joint Commission.
</P>
<P>
Ramelan said the two countries would also soon sign other
agreements including agreements on investment guaranty provision,
tourism cooperation and counter-trade as a follow-up to the
medium-and-long-term cooperation accords.
</P>
<P>
The volume of current trade between Indonesia and Russia was
not large, he said. In the January-October period of 1998, two-way
trade reached a total value of 115.4 million U.S. dollars with
Russia enjoying a surplus of 38.4 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Geogry V. Gabuniya arrived here Friday accompanying Deputy
Prime Minister D. Maslyukov for an official visit to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian President B.J. Habibie met with Maslyukov at the
presidential palace in the afternoon, during which both sides
agreed to strengthen bilateral relations in a constructive and
mutual beneficial manner based on the principle of equality.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder Recommended to Head German Ruling Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gerhard Glogowski, SPD premier of Lower Saxony, told reporters
the party executive had agreed to back Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
Oscar Lafontaine on Thursday surprisingly quit his post as
finance minister and chairman of the party.
</P>
<P>
Lafontaine's resignation, following a bitter cabinet row, ended
months of power struggle with the federal chancellor, who is
expected to consolidate his standing by seeking the leadership
over the party.
</P>
<P>
However, given the strong support for Lafontaine in the party,
there is a danger that a less emphatic vote for Schroeder could
further damage his power base, critics indicated.
</P>
<P>
Seeking to limit damage to the five-month-old government, SPD
leaders stressed the center-left alliance with the Greens remained
stable despite Lafontaine's resignation.
</P>
<P>
"We want this coalition to continue working through the end of
the legislature period," said SPD parliamentary leader, Peter
Struck.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder was elected for a four-year term last September in a
coalition with the Greens. His government was sworn a month later.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Germany's Allensbach polling institute predicted
tough times ahead for Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
Some 60 percent of voters no longer believed Schroeder would
succeed in cutting Germany's near post-war record unemployment
which rose to 11.6 percent in February, said Allensbach Director,
Renate Koecher.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 percent believe the government will raise taxes
rather than cut taxes as Schroeder has promised, said Koecher.

<HEADLINE> Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey Hail NATO's Enlargement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Presidents of Romania,
Bulgaria and Turkey on Friday sent a congratulatory telegram to
their counterparts in the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary on
their countries' formal entry into the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Romania's President Emil Constantinescu, Bulgaria's President
Petar Stoianov and Turkey's President Suleyman Demirel, who just
ended a two-day trilateral summit meeting in Romanian mountain
resort Sinaia, agreed that the accession of the three countries to
NATO will enhances regional security.
</P>
<P>
The three heads of state signed on Friday, at the end of the
trilateral summit, a joint statement on NATO's expansion. The
statement expresses their firm confidence that further enlargement
of the Alliance, to South-Eastern Europe in particular, would
represent a key contribution to the stability of the region as
well as of the whole continent.
</P>
<P>
They welcomed the forthcoming NATO Summit in Washington as an
important event, which will outline prospects for the Alliance
into the next century.
</P>
<P>
The Presidents expected the NATO summit to enhance the momentum
of the enlargement process by firmly attesting that countries
which have significantly contributed to NATO's values and
objectives and advanced in their efforts to meet accession
criteria, like Romania and Bulgaria, are regarded as future Allies.
</P>
<P>
They also expected the Summit to define a clear membership
perspective for these two states, accompanied by a substantial
accession strategy.

<HEADLINE> Labor Union Criticizes Banana Dispute by Big Powers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The World Confederation of Labor
(WCL) on Friday criticized the United States and European Union (
EU) for their dispute over bananas, saying that both sides did not
mention working conditions on the banana plantations in developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
The WCL, along with its member union, the World Federation of
Agriculture and Food Workers (WFAFW) said in a statement that "the
notorious banana dispute has taken a technical shape, veiling what
is really at stake."
</P>
<P>
"Whereas the two blocs, Europe and the United States, lash out
at each other with commercial standards, not a word is said about
the working conditions on the plantations, where the workers sweat
out the measures to lower the production cost," they said.
</P>
<P>
The Brussels based WCL has its member unions in 130 developing
countries in the world. Andre Linard, the organization's press
staff, said the WCL represents over 26 million workers mainly in
South American, African and Asia Pacific regions, as well as a
small number of workers in North America and Europe.
</P>
<P>
The WCL and WFAFW pointed out that in developing countries'
banana plantations, low wages, delayed payment, diseases resulting
from the use of pesticides, and dismissal of workers who join a
trade union are the normal practice.
</P>
<P>
The two unions also said the banana dispute is not a
geographical issue in its nature. "It opposes the multinational
corporations, which want to control the whole market, to the small
producers and the workers. Those corporations make considerable
profits which they use to finance election campaigns so as to have
their private interests protected by the public authorities," said
the WCL and WFAFW.
</P>
<P>
The United States on March 3 announced unilaterally that it
would impose 520 million US dollars in import duties on European
products to compensate for losses allegedly suffered by American
companies in the Latin American banana market. The US believes the
EU has failed to reform its import regime enough to remove any
discrimination against imports by US-run corporations, and insists
that the regime is still in favor of some former European colonies
in African, Caribbean and Pacific regions.
</P>
<P>
EU officials argue that Caribbean farmers are small scale and
cannot grow their crops as cheaply as the large estates of Latin
America. Bananas are the staple of these islands' economies,
providing as much as 60 percent of their export earnings, so any
free trade regime would condemn them to absolute poverty.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the effect of losing the preferential treatment from
the EU would be devastating for the poor Caribbean countries, they
said.
</P>
<P>
The WCL and WFAFW noted that the United States has declared
that it is a "matter of principle:" respect for the regulations of
the World Trade Organization. Yet, both unions wonder if
principles wreck the economies of a number of small countries and
have serious human consequences, wouldn't it be better to
challenge the legitimacy of those principles -- the "market at any
cost?"

appealed to the Kosovo conflict parties on Friday to reach a peace
agreement in the new round of talks scheduled to begin in France

</P>
<P>
Romania's President Emil Constantinescu, Bulgaria's President
Petar Stoianov and Turkey's President Suleyman Demirel made the
appeal at the end of a two-day summit in Sinaia, a mountain resort
some 150 kilometers north of Bucharest.
</P>
<P>
The presidents expressed deep concern about the current
situation in Kosovo, saying that the Kosovo crisis not only
threatened regional peace and stability but also may bring about
adverse results to the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that Kosovo's substantial autonomy must respect
Yugoslavia's territorial integrity and the legitimate rights and
freedoms of various ethnic groups in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The presidents reiterated their support of all international
efforts made to peacefully solve the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
The summit is the third of a series that opened in Varna of
Bulgaria, the second was held in Antalya, Turkey, after the
Romania-Bulgaria-Turkey trilateral was inaugurated in September

UNITED NATIONS, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Vienna-based Center
of International Crime Prevention (CICP) had announced the launch
of three new global programs aimed at curbing the growth of
illegal international activities, a U.N. release said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The new strategies are against corruption, trafficking in human

instruments against corruption; and technical cooperation projects
to assist countries in building or strengthening their ability to
prevent, detect and fight corruption.
</P>
<P>
The two agencies will also collaborate on the global program
against trafficking in human beings, which will focus on the
growing involvement of organized criminal groups with smuggling
and trafficking human beings.

<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani Says Khatami's Visit to Italy Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Former Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani here Friday said President Mohammad Khatami's landmark
visit to Italy was "successful and fruitful."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Friday prayers congregation at downtown Tehran
University, Rafsanjani blamed the West for its "imprecise
analysis" of the visit, the first by an Iranian head of state to a
Western country in the 20 years of Islamic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
"The Westerners are interpreting Khatami's trip to Italy as a
necessity to get the Islamic Republic of Iran out of economic
problems and isolation," Rafsanjani said, "We want to ask the West
when Iran was isolated?"
</P>
<P>
"Such political analysis are imprecise," he added.
</P>
<P>
"If you want to assess the visit, it would be better that you
take into account the humanitarian side of the issue and that such
visits are meant to defuse tension, promote mutual understanding
and world peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
Khatami concluded his three-day visit to Rome on Thursday,
during which he appealed that Western nations treat Iran and
Islamic states as international equals.
</P>
<P>
He encouraged other Wester power to follow Italy and open
dialog and expand relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating his policy of detente, Khatami reaffirmed Tehran's
determination to fight terrorism and the spread of nuclear arms
and weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, however, also criticized the Italy for allowing
Iranian dissidents to demonstrate in "disrespect" of Khatami. The
protesters managed to throw a paint-filled egg at Khatami's
limousine during his visit in Rome.
</P>
<P>
In proest of the visit, a number of overseas Iranians occupied
the Italian consulate in Amsterdam and the Italian embassy in
Paris for several minutes, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, currently the chairman of the powerful advisory
State Expediency Council, said that such incidents seemed to be
pre-planned.
</P>
<P>
"You allow such incidents to take place in the name of freedom
and you should also know that there are people who could also do
the same things here at the time of your visits," he warned.

TEHRAN, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Friday claimed big
economic gains from the ground-breaking visit of President
Mohammad Khatami to Italy, the first ever visit by an Iranian
head of state to Europe since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the official Islamic Republic News Agency,
Minister of Mines and Metals Eshaq Jahangiri said that during
Khatami's visit which concluded Thursday, Tehran and Rome signed
2-billion-U.S.-dollar contracts on projects in Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Italian Ansaldo Energia Company would participate in the
Bandar Abbas power plant project, worth 1 billion dollars, in
southern Iran through the sale of 30 gas turbines and transfer of
technology, he said.
</P>
<P>
Italy will also join in the development scheme of the
250-million-dollar Mobarekeh steel mills, Jahangiri said, adding
the two sides also agreed to establish regular twice-a-week
flights by Italy's national carrier in return for entry permits
for 2,500 Iranian lorries to Italy.
</P>
<P>
Jahangiri also said that the Italian national oil company ENI
will invest up to 3 billion dollars in Iran's oil industry.
</P>
<P>
The two sides signed an agreement backing joint investments,
which will pave the way for mutual investment by public and
private sectors of the two countries, he added.

<HEADLINE> Vinegar Could Be Used for Screening Cervical Cancer: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Vinegar has proved to be useful as
a cheap and effective screening test for cervical cancer,
scientists said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Scientists said that vinegar, or acetic acid, could be used
where the standard Pap smear is unavailable or too expensive and
could improve the chances of preventing cervical cancer in the
developing world.
</P>
<P>
The researchers, from Johns Hopkins University, the United
States, and the University of Zimbabwe, evaluated the vinegar
screening test in a study of 10,000 women at 15 clinics in
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Their results, published in the medical journal The Lancet,
concluded that the test was safe and effective.
</P>
<P>
The new test involves a visual inspection of the cervix as
opposed to sending a sample to a laboratory. The doctors simply
wash the cervix with dilute acetic acid and then inspect it by
eye.
</P>
<P>
The women studied were screened using both the acetic acid test
and the traditional method. The researchers found that both
techniques had a similar detection rate.
</P>
<P>
The researchers said it has proved that the new method "can
identify most true cases of cervical pre-cancer and cancer."
</P>
<P>
Cervical cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting
women, killing 200,000 each year, and is the leading cause of
cancer deaths in parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
However, scientists said that the earlier the cancer is
detected, the better the chances of defeating it. If it is caught
before it spreads beyond the cervix, 95 percent of cases are
believed to be curable.

<HEADLINE> S-300 Missiles to Be Deployed on Crete in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Russian-made S-300
anti-aircraft missiles, ordered by Cyprus, will be transferred to
Greece's Crete island in mid-1999, the Cyprus News Agency (CNA)
reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
With all legal and technical matters of the deal now settled,
what remains to be completed is Greece's preparatory works for the
deployment, CNA said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russian media reported that by the end of July 1999,
Moscow will be ready to deploy six batteries of TOR M1 short-range
missiles in Greece, and that by the end of 2000, Athens will
receive another 15 such missile batteries.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus ordered the S-300 missile system in January 1997 in a
bid to bolster its air defense capability. The move was cursed by
Turkey, which termed it a threat to security and vowed to take
pre-emptive measures should the missiles be deployed in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The United States and some other Western countries also opposed
the deal and pressured Cyprus to cancel its implementation to
prevent an escalation of tension between Cyprus and Greece on the
one side, and Turkey and Turkish Cypriots on the other.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides announced on December 29,
1998 that the missiles will be deployed not in Cyprus, but in
Greece's Crete island, about 500 kilometers in the west, instead.

KAMPALA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
said Friday that Uganda is resolved to modernize itself through
education.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when presiding over the function marking
the eighth congregation of the Institute of Teacher Education at
Kyambogo main campus here, a press release from the President's
Office said.
</P>
<P>
He said that education reform is essential in order to improve
the quality of education and make it more relevant to the needs of
the population and the ever changing environment.
</P>
<P>
Education should be at the heart of both personal and community
 development so that the people can develop their talents and
realize their creative potential, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Proper training for teachers as the most important facet of
education reform should be emphasized, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Commending the institute for being responsible for teacher
training at all levels, Museveni said he is glad that the
institute has expressed its positive response to the education
reform policy by continuously reviewing curricular and syllabi at
different levels as well as introducing new programs and
innovations to social needs.
</P>
<P>
He further reaffirmed the government's total commitment to
universal primary education as an essential ingredient for
national development and modernization.

<HEADLINE> UK Warns Parliament to Prepare for Strikes on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- British government ministers
Friday warned the parliament that British armed forces could soon
take part in strikes against Yugoslavia if talks next week fail to
secure peace in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In a joint letter written to all members of parliament, Junior
Foreign Minister Tony Lloyd and Junior Defense Minister Doug
Henderson said that MPs should prepare for the talks to fail.
</P>
<P>
"Belgrade may choose to reject the agreement and/or launch a
major offensive, leading to an overwhelming human catastrophe,"
the two ministers said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
Britain was prepared to take necessary action to avert that
catastrophe, the letter said.
</P>
<P>
"In this crucial period, (Yugoslav) President (Slobodan)
Milosovic and his commanders must understand that NATO will not
stand by in the face of oppression and atrocities in Kosovo," said
the letter.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook is scheduled to travel to
Paris Monday to co-chair a second round of talks between
representatives of Yugoslavia and ethnic Albanians living in the
Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the two sides held 17 days of negotiations in
France. The talks failed as both of the rivalry parties refused to
sign the treaty initiated by the Contact Group, which promised a
substantial autonomy to the Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
There has been no sign that the two parties would reach an
agreement in the next round of talks. Albanians told United States
mediator Bob Dole last week that they would sign the treaty but
later withdraw from the stand.

The United Nations pulled all of its international staff out of

"Other determining factors include recent assessments of the
security conditions in the country and a vision of common U.N.
strategy for Afghanistan for the coming months," the spokesman

The United Nations would continue to monitor closely the

<HEADLINE> Primakov: Russia Must Reach Agreement With IMF on Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
said here Friday that Russia must reach an agreement with the
International Monetary Fund on its foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
"We can't progress in relations with the World Bank until we
reach agreement with the IMF, and most critical, we can't complete
a restructuring deal with the London and Paris clubs," Primakov
told an expanded session of the Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
"Untied loans have been blocked completely, and tied loans have
been complicated," Interfax quoted Primakov as saying.
</P>
<P>
An IMF delegation led by Gegard Belanger, deputy director of
the Second European Department, is here negotiating with the
Russian government.
</P>
<P>
"We need an agreement with the IMF, but this doesn't mean that
this will be the main support in the development of the domestic
economy," Primakov said. "This isn't so. But an agreement is
important anyway."
</P>
<P>
According to Russian Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov, the
country's domestic and foreign debt had topped 100 billion U.S.
dollars by August, with debt on Treasury bills and federal loan
bonds over 80 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
On August 17 last year, the former government of Sergei
Kiriyenko devalued the ruble and declared a 90-day moratorium on
some foreign debts, an effective default seen by many economists.
</P>
<P>
The ruble has since tumbled to 23 to the U.S. dollar from the
pre-crisis exchange rate of 6.3 rubles to a dollar.
</P>
<P>
Zadornov attributed the August crisis to excessive borrowing in
foreign and domestic markets to finance budget spending, noting
that debts of regional budgets were 40-50 percent of annual
revenue.
</P>
<P>
Short-term debt of commercial banks and companies had grown to
30 billion to 40 billion dollars by July.
</P>
<P>
"An illusion of a balance and economic stability was formed
while we were living in debt, but a change in external conditions
put colossal pressure on the entire unstable structure," Zadornov
said.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan PM Accused of Involvement in Genocide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan Prime Minister Pierre Celestin
Rwigema has been charged by one member of parliament from his own
party, the Republican Democratic Party (MDR), of having been involved in
the 1994 genocide.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister who is persecuting us is accused of having been
involved in the genocide, and of being a Hutu extremist," Jacques
Maniraguha said Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He was reacting to Tuesday's decision of the forum of eight political
parties forming the current transitional government and parliament to expel
four MPs from the MDR party from parliament, reported the Rwandan
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The forum, chaired by the Secretary General of the Rwandese Patriotic
Front (RPF), Charles Muligande, had ordered Maniraguha, and three other MPs
from MDR, Jean Baptiste Sebarame, Eustache Nkerinka, and Jean Leonard
Bizimana to resign from their seats within 15 days, or else they would be
sacked from their party.
</P>
<P>
The four are accused of a number of charges including absenteeism during
parliamentary sessions, and acts relating to troubling the security of the
state in backing the Hutu Interahamwe militia.
</P>
<P>
But the four declared Friday that this decision is unconstitutional, and
said they will not resign. They charged the prime minister of being the
instigator of their expulsion in smearing their reputation, because they
had opposed his taking over of the chairmanship of the party.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Develop Test for "Undetectable" Sports Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- German and Danish researchers said
Friday they have developed a test for growth hormone doping in
sport, which was previously regarded as undetectable.
</P>
<P>
Misuse of drugs in sport is common, but not always detected.
Some substances are particularly difficult to detect when
injected, especially those that mimic naturally occurring hormones
in the body.
</P>
<P>
Growth hormone is one such substance that is produced by the
pituitary gland in the brain, but which is also manufactured for
injection.
</P>
<P>
Until now there has been no reliable way to differentiate
between the natural and the injected hormone by blood or urine
samples, leaving athletes who abuse growth hormone able to escape
detection.
</P>
<P>
However, German and Danish researchers reported in a letter to
the medical journal The Lancet that they have developed the first
test that can differentiate between naturally occurring and
manufactured hormones.
</P>
<P>
The test depends on blood being taken within 36 hours of growth
hormone injection, which, as the scientists pointed out, means
that "out of competition" testing would have to be implemented.
</P>
<P>
The researchers, led by Dr Christian Strasburger and colleagues
at Innenstadt University Hospital in Munich, Germany, said that
the blood test also depends on blood being taken, which is not at
present the case for control samples.
</P>
<P>
But the scientists were confident that such administrative
obstacle can be overcome by the authorities in politics and sport,
in view of the serious side effects of growth hormone misuse.
</P>
<P>
"From an analytical point of view, the dogma of
`undetectability' of r-hGH (manufactured human growth hormone)
misuse no longer holds true," they concluded.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Open Six Pharaonic Tombs to Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has planned to open six more
pharaonic tombs in Luxor to tourists in the coming days, the
Middle East News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Egyptian Minister of Culture Farouk Hosni
during an inspection tour in Luxor, 670 kilometers south of Cairo,
the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The tombs, which are on the west bank of the Nile river,
include four for a queen and three kings in the 18th, 19th and
20th dynasties of ancient Egypt, dating back to 16th-11th century
B.C., and two for two senior officials in the 19th dynasty.
</P>
<P>
The government has spent 5 million Egyptian pounds (147.1
million U.S. dollars) to face-lift the tombs, Hosni said.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the tombs is part of a plan of Egypt's Supreme
Antiquities Council headed by Hosni to ease the intensive tourist
movement in the valleys of kings and queens by providing
alternative attractions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Luxor, a famous resort in southern Egypt, is renowned for tombs
of kings and queens as well as magnificent temples of ancient
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The kings and queens were buried separately in the kings valley
and the queens valley.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 12 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Friday expressed his great sadness over the death of
Britain's violinist Yehudi Menuhin.
</P>
<P>
Sir Yehudi Menuhin, one of the world's most famous violinists
and music teachers, died in Berlin Friday at the age of 82.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by his spokesman's office, Annan said,
"Yehudi Menuhin was not only a great musician whose art brought
joy to millions of people all over the world. He was also a
brilliant teacher and a citizen of the world in the fullest sense
-- one whose vision and culture gave him a deep empathy with
fellow human beings of every creed and color, and who constantly
sought to place his fame and wisdom at the service of humanity."
</P>
<P>
"I was privileged to meet him many times and was always
impressed by the sweetness of his nature and the breadth of his
concerns," the U.N. chief said.
</P>
<P>
"As a member of a people which more than any other has been the
victim of this century's barbarism, he redeemed the century by
rising above all resentment and showing what human beings at their
best are capable of," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"The world is a sadder place without him, but his music, and
his example, will endure," Annan added.

<HEADLINE> Gas Well Still Burning In India's Western Offshore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The gas well in India's
Western offshore which caught fire Friday is still burning, with
the area virtually covered by water umbrella to prevent the fire
from spreading and damaging the rig and other equipment.
</P>
<P>
Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), owner of the well, was
awaiting the arrival on Sunday of two experts from the United
States to assess the burning well and chalk out an action plan to
put out the fire, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported Saturday
from Mumbai, about 1,400 kilometers southwest of here.
</P>
<P>
An uncontrolled flow of gas, which began at 09:30 local time on
Thursday from a well numbering "B-121-D," started spewing fire
from 12:20 p.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
The flow of gas was connected to other five platforms
comprising wells nearby, according to an ONGC spokesman.
</P>
<P>
PTI said that multi-purpose support vehicles were spraying
water at a rate of 20,000 cubic meters per hour to ensure that the
rig and other equipment remain cool and damage prevented.
</P>
<P>
ONGC is suffering a loss of around 1.6 million cubic meters of
gas a day, or 3 percent of the total gas production in the Western
offshore.
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult to say when the fire would be brought under
control," PTI quoted an ONGC director as saying.
</P>
<P>
A regional contingency plan has been activated. The Regional
Contingency Committee comprises, among others, ONGC, navy, coast
guard, air force, state government authorities and other companies
and organizations involving in marine activity.
</P>
<P>
The B-121 platform, which produces 2 million cubic meters of
gas per day, was reportedly shut down for maintenance work two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
There are 126 well platforms in the Western offshore, some 160
kilometers off Mumbai, of which only nine are purely gas platforms
and the rests are oil-cum-gas platforms.

<HEADLINE> United Nations Staff to Return to Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations announced
here Saturday that U.N. staff would begin a gradual process of
return to their posts inside Afghanistan beginning on March 16.
</P>
<P>
Following a decision of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, a
limited number of international staff will be allowed to resume
their humanitarian work inside the country, said a press release
issued Saturday by the Office for Coordination of Humanitarian
Assistance to Afghanistan (UNOCHA).
</P>
<P>
On August 22, 1998, 40 international U.N. staff were evacuated
from all locations in Afghanistan following a series of incidents
targeting U.N. personnel.
</P>
<P>
Two Afghan staff members from the World Food Program (WFP) and
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees were abducted
and murdered in Jalalabad last July.
</P>
<P>
In August, following U.S. bombing raids in Khost, Afghanistan,
UNOCHA and WFP offices in Jalalabad were attacked by a mob, and
one day later U.N. military observer Lt. Colonel Carmine Calo was
murdered in the streets of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The release said that U.N. programs managed locally by national
staff working in Afghanistan have continued under the supervision
of international staff evacuated to Islamabad, Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator for Afghanistan Erik de Mul has
expressed his appreciation for the dedication shown by U.N. Afghan
staff during this challenging period, the release said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations and the Afghan Taliban militia signed a
security protocol on October 24, 1998 and have met to discuss
security issues in Kandahar, Kabul of Afghanistan and Islamabad.
Last month, a technical observation mission, headed by a
specialist in judicial processes and investigations, traveled to
Kabul to assess the status of the investigations in three
murdering cases.
</P>
<P>
The mission concluded that the Taliban had made a satisfactory
and concerted effort to resolve these cases, said the release.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of this investigation, the release said, the
United Nations next sent security assessment missions to Kabul,
Herat, Kandahar and Jalalabad, which determined that the
environment in these areas was conducive for the return of what
will initially be limited number of international staff.
</P>
<P>
International staff from the UNOCHA, WFP, the United Nations
Children's Fund and the World Health Organization will be
stationed in Kabul to begin with, the release said.
</P>
<P>
In the week from March 22, international staff from various
agencies will resume work in Kandahar. If the security environment
remains stable, this will be followed by the return of staff to
Herat and Jalalabad.
</P>
<P>
Following the return of international staff to Kabul, the
United Nations will resume negotiations with the Taliban on issues
of education and health, according to the release.

<HEADLINE> China Encourages Growth of Non-Public Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Deputies attending the on-going
Second Session of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC),
China's top lawmaking body, have pinned high hopes on the
confirmation of the status of the private economic sector in a
constitutional amendment proposed by the NPC Standing Committee,
</P>
<P>
They called it a true reform to boost the fledgling sector.
</P>
<P>
"The amendment, if passed, will give us a big relief," said
Liang Wengen, a private business boss from Hunan Province, "
legally speaking, I feel a real equality." The private businesses
are facing a good opportunity of development and "we should be
bolder to go ahead," he noted.
</P>
<P>
All private enterprises in the country were changed into firms
of joint state-private ownership in the 1950s, and private
enterprises emerged again in the late 1970s when the government
began its reform and opening-up drive.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent report by the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, the number of private firms has grown from 90,000 about
a decade ago to the present more than one million. Official
statistics show that by the end of last year, China had more than
32 million workers employed by the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the annual added value of the non-public industrial
enterprises accounts for 50 percent of the country's total annual
industrial added value.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the Fifteenth National Congress of the ruling
Communist Party of China (CPC) said explicitly in its report that
the non-public sector is an important component of the country's
socialist market economy and the sector should be further
encouraged. The proposed constitutional amendment gives expression
to this principle.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, local governments at different levels have
issued or will publish new policies to boost the private sector.
Private businesses have been encouraged to participate in the
restructuring of the public sector through various means such as
share-holding, purchase, merger and leasing.
</P>
<P>
Lu Guanqiu, a well-known township-based industrialist who has
exported his products to many foreign countries, said that the
private businesses' participation in the reform of state
enterprises will inject new vitality into the state firms and will
also lead to a rapid expansion of the private sector. He believed
it will help adjust the pattern of industries and the mix of
products of the country.
</P>
<P>
To further encourage the private sector this year, the central
government granted earlier this year 61 private companies the
permission to export or import goods, which had been a franchise
only enjoyed by some state-owned factories.
</P>
<P>
In a recent speech, Governor of the People's Bank of China Dai
Xianglong announced that local banks will no longer issues loans
to companies according to their types of ownership, but will do
only according to their performance.
</P>
<P>
Some NPC deputies said that with the support of state policies
and credits, the non-public sector will greatly increase their
competitiveness and expand their scope of businesses. Large
private enterprise groups will come into being and will play an
important role in the country's economic development.

<HEADLINE> Defense Show Not Related to Tensions in Gulf: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 13 (Xinhua) -- A UAE official said on
Saturday that the International Defense Exhibition (IDEX '99) to
be opened here on Sunday has no connection with tensions in the
Gulf.
</P>
<P>
"IDEX '99 is a neutral exhibition which focuses on trade,"
said Brigadier sultan Al Suwaidi, chairman of the Military
Committee for International Exhibitions and Conferences (CODEX),
at a press conference on the eve of the five-day show.
</P>
<P>
"The exhibition has no connection whatsoever with the Iraq
issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the conflict between the UAE and Iran over
the three disputed islands will affect Iran's participation in
the event, the official said the exhibition will open its arms to
all countries, and it will not be used as any "intermediary" to
solve the dispute.
</P>
<P>
Iran is coming back to the IDEX after it pulled out in
1997.
</P>
<P>
The GCC foreign ministers held an emergency meeting earlier
this month to condemn Iran's military excercises near the Gulf
islands of Abu Mousa and Larger and Lesser Tunbs, which are
claimed by both the UAE and Iran.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, held biannually since 1993, will be attended
by 848 companies from 41 countries, including some of the
world's top defense manufacturers, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
He said that besides the important countries which attended
previous shows, IDEX '99 will witness some new participants
including Kuwait, Bahrain, Belarus, and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
IDEX '99 will show the latest and most advanced weapons and
equipments produced by such world renowned manufacturers as
British Aerospace, Marconi Electronic Systems, GIAT, Lockheed
Martin, and Ratheon Industries.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Addresses Pressing Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said today that China must control its population, protect natural
resources and maintain a sound ecological environment while
gaining economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin, also general secretary of the Central Committee of
the Communist Party of China (CPC), made the remark during an
afternoon work conference on the population, resources and
environment.
</P>
<P>
CPC Central Committee and State leaders including Li Peng, Zhu
Rongji, Li Ruihuan, Hu Jintao, Wei Jianxing and Li Lanqing
attended the meeting held in the Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
"We must always pay close attention to coordinating economic
construction efforts with population control and resource and
environmental protection efforts in order to realize China's cross-
century goals for sustainable economic and social development,"
said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the big population, shortage of resources and
serious environmental pollution have emerged as factors hindering
China's economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that CPC committees and governments at various
levels have made consistent progress in population control and
resource and environmental protection in accordance with unified
plans adopted by the CPC Central Committee and State Council.
</P>
<P>
"We still face an arduous task in dealing with these issues,"
said Jiang. "We must gain a deep understanding and deal correctly
with the relationship between economic development and population
control, resources and environment from a strategic point of view.
</P>
<P>
"We must fully understand that the urgent task is directly
related to the subsistence and development of the Chinese nation,
and must consistently carry out related work."
</P>
<P>
The president urged local governments to extend greater efforts
to achieve marked results, and stressed that population control
and resource and environmental protection is interrelated and
systematic work which requires coordination between all
departments and society as a whole.
</P>
<P>
He said local officials should conduct research, draft plans
and supervise work instead of simply relying on documents.
</P>
<P>
Officials should conduct on-the-spot examinations, and should
learn the truth by maintaining close contact with grassroots units.
Good experiences should be summarized and popularized, and
solutions should be promptly found to solve problems, according to
Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Those who neglect their duties must be punished, the president
added.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Calls for Improved Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today called for major progress in environmental improvement
efforts during 1999.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the call during an afternoon meeting covering
population control and resources and environmental protection,
factors crucial to the government's strategy for a sustainable
development of the country.
</P>
<P>
He said governments at all levels should grasp every
opportunity to adjust their industrial structures and strengthen
infrastructure construction in order to enhance environmental
protection efforts.
</P>
<P>
China is striving to halt pollution and ecological
deterioration, and improve the environmental quality of major
cities and regions by the year 2000, with long-term effort to
focus on significantly improving urban and rural environmental
quality by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said all provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities
should not only control the total discharge volume of pollutants
according to state standards, but should also ensure that all
industries meet discharge standards and all major cities meet
environmental quality standards by 2000.
</P>
<P>
This year is very important for the efforts to achieve the
nation's environmental protection goals in the next century, said
Jiang, adding that environmental policies should be strictly
implemented in all regions, cities and enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He urged the national capital Beijing to further enhance
pollution control efforts and improve its environmental quality
during the year.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that a national program on ecological and
environmental protection should be drafted and implemented
immediately. Different measures should be adopted in line with
different situations at localities, he added.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Calls for Strengthened Family Planning Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today called for strengthened family planning work to curb China's
population growth.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an afternoon work conference on population control
and resource and environmental protection, Jiang said population
control deals with a wide range of difficult issues and must not
be relaxed.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who also serves as general secretary of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, pointed out that China
should further improve its population macro-control, family
planning management and social insurance systems in accordance
with the development needs of socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
Education, legal, economic and administrative measures should
be adopted to ensure effective population control work. Long-term
efforts should center on controlling the nation's population
growth in line with well established goals, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He pointed to the difficulties involving population control in
rural areas, and noted that experience shows that the key to the
problem lies in the establishment of grass roots organizations in
the countryside. Specialized personnel should be assigned to
direct the work, funds should be allocated and related regulations
should be adopted, according to Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He added that population control should be directly linked with
economic development and helping farmers gain prosperity. Jiang
said policies should be introduced to help farmers solve problems
related to daily life and production and encourage them to
participate in family planning.

<HEADLINE> National Cotton Market to Open in Xinjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- A national cotton market will be
put into operation this year in Urumqi, the capital of the
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
The whole project costs some 200 million yuan and the market
has a floor-space of 46,000 sq.m. Its main part has been completed.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang is the largest cotton producer in China. Last year,
the autonomous region had 980,000 ha. of cotton fields, about one
third of the country's total, and turned out 1.37 million tons,
accounting for six percent of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
Abdul'ahat Abdurixit, chairman of the regional government and a
deputy to the Ninth National People's Congress which is now in its
second annual session here, said Xinjiang plans to realize
industrial management of cotton production by setting up
enterprise groups embracing the functions of production, marketing
and processing, in order to build up an efficient cotton
circulation system.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the cotton market will help reduce the
cost of cotton production and explore the international market.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there is a national cotton trading center in
Zhengzhou, the capital of central Henan Province, also a major
cotton producer in the country.

<HEADLINE> China Must Practice Strict Land Resource Management, Jiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today stressed that China, a developing country with the world's
largest population, must apply strict land resource management
practices.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a work conference on population control and
resources and environmental protection attended by high-ranking
Party and government officials, Jiang said that all regions must
prevent any further shrinkage in cultivated land.
</P>
<P>
"No department or unit should be allowed to illegally occupy
land managed by farmers according to land contracts," said Jiang,
who also serves as general secretary of the Communist Party of
China Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
He said China's land and natural resources must be strictly
protected and managed, with the development and protection of
resources carried out simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said priority must be placed to practicing thrift when
developing resources, and noted that efficiency must be upgraded
in order to ensure the intensive rather than extensive use of
resources.
</P>
<P>
He said a new resource management system should be established
to respond to requirements for developing the socialist market
economy. The centralized system will not only be highly efficient
and authoritative, but also be conducive to strengthening planning,
managing, protecting and ensuring the rational utilization of
resources nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said China now faces an extremely acute shortage of water
and must practice conservation, prevent pollution and strengthen
management to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
Saving water must be a long-term measure applicable to all
trades and people from all walks of life, said Jiang.

<HEADLINE> Unified Contract Law Good for Orderly Development of China's Economy (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Deputy Li Li, a law expert from Guangzhou University, said the
old contract laws were formulated in the years when the concept of
market economy was not established, so they bear the mark of the
planned economy, with more stresses on administrative power. There
are too many restrictions on the contract freedom of the parties
involved in the contract, and the main party in the concept of the
economic contract is social organization in those contract laws,
which do not cover explicitly the multiple contract parties, that
is, the existing state-owned enterprises and non-public businesses.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that some four billion contracts are
signed a year in China. In 1997, there were 1.5 million cases of
economic disputes in the country, mostly involving economic
contracts, and among the three million civil cases handled in the
same year by the courts at all levels, 1.4 million cases were
contract disputes.
</P>
<P>
Lu Weizhong, an NPC deputy and vice-chairman of the Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Regional Federation of Industry and Commerce,
said that the draft unified contract law has a clearer definition
about the responsibilities of the party who violates the contract
compared with the existing three contract laws.
</P>
<P>
Li Zhongqi, general manager of the Yangtze River Group
Corporation, said that it is a remarkable feature of the draft
unified contract law which absorbs new experience from developed
countries and complies to the international practice, and
therefore, it will serve to further promote the country's opening
up drive.

<HEADLINE> Unified Contract Law Good for Orderly Development of China's Economy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The existing three contract laws
have many pitfalls and loopholes and Chinese companies often get
trapped when signing or executing contracts," an NPC deputy from
central China's Hubei province said in an interview with Xinhua
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Li Guojin, an entrepreneur from Wuhan, capital of central China'
s Hubei Province, is one of the some 2,800 deputies to the ongoing
session of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), China's
highest lawmaking body.
</P>
<P>
Li Guojin said that he had come up with many troubles or even
disputes in his business, mostly involving contracts, he said.
</P>
<P>
While deliberating a draft unified contract law submitted to
the current NPC session to replace the existing three contract
laws, Li Guojin said that the unified contract law, the first of
its kind in China if adopted, is the urgent need of the developing
market economy of the country and an effective guarantee for the
orderly development of China's economy.
</P>
<P>
The three existing contract laws are the Law of Economic
Contracts, Law for Sino-Foreign Economic Contracts and Law of
Technical Contracts. They were formulated in the early 1980s or
the mid-1980s and are not suited to the need of the social life
and economic development with the deepening of the reforms and
opening up drive, according to the NPC deputies.
</P>
<P>
The new unified contract law draft is conducive to enlivening
commodities circulation, expanding domestic demand and promoting
the sustainable and healthy development of the market-driven
economy, according to some law experts who are NPC deputies.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Chengsi, Member of the NPC Law Committee and a researcher
of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said the existing three
contract laws no longer meet the demand of the fast developing
market-driven economy.

<HEADLINE> Clashes Renewed in Somali Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The relative stability around
the main market of Karan District, north Mogadishu, was shattered
Friday by heavy clashes between militiamen loyal to Muse Sudi
Yalahow and others organized by the business community in the
market.
</P>
<P>
At least two people were killed and five others wounded when
about five battle wagons and dozens of heavily armed militiamen
exchanged fire in the security men of the market.
</P>
<P>
According to an eyewitness in the market, the victims who were
mainly civilians caught in the cross fire.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the clashes are not officiated. However, the
businessmen in the market have accused Muse Sudi Yalahow of asking
for a forceful taxation from every businessman in the market.
</P>
<P>
Muse Sudi Yalahow, who is among the leaders opposing to
Mogadishu's administration announced by Ali Mahdi and Hussein
Aidid, believes that he has the right to collect tax after freeing
the area from the bandits who made the road to Karan market almost
impassable. But the businessmen worried that they would not be
recognized as neutral businessmen once they give money to any of
the opposing politicians of the capital.
</P>
<P>
There has been no official ceasefire tentative between the two
sides Saturday as the opposing militiamen still remain in
defensive positions around the market.
</P>
<P>
Early in the week, militiamen loyal to Muse Sudi Yalahow had
cracked down bandits who extorted money from the commercial
traffic in illegal roadblocks not very far from this same market
area of Karan District.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 armed gangs have been rounded up from various
roadblocks between Karan and El-Adde, about 15 km north of
Mogadishu, and are waiting for Islamic trials.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Roundup Roundup: Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic Join NATO With Mixed Feeling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic formally joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (
NATO) on Friday in a ceremony in Missouri, the United States. This
is a step of significance in NATO's enlargement that will have a
strong impact on the political and security pattern of Europe in
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the three countries hailed their countries' NATO
membership, saying the move accomplished their long-time dream of
"returning to Europe" and would strengthen peace and security in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
They emphasized their countries' NATO membership was not
directed at any third party and hoped it would not affect
negatively the relations between the three and Russia either.
</P>
<P>
The three countries have made constant efforts for joining the
military alliance since the Warsaw Pact dismembered in 1991.
</P>
<P>
They have reformed their political systems and economic and
military structures to move closer to the Western countries.
Internationally, they have coordinated their policies with them.
</P>
<P>
Their efforts coincided with the strategic aim of the United
States which seeks to weaken Russia so as to control Europe.
</P>
<P>
With the help of the United States and other Western countries,
the three countries started their NATO membership talks in 1997
and completed the legal procedures on the matter in February when
their parliaments ratified the related documents.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, disputes over whether to join the NATO have never
stopped in these three countries, with a recent poll showing a big
number of people still opposing the NATO membership.
</P>
<P>
These people argued that the NATO membership could jeopardize
their countries' decision-making power in the political and
diplomatic issues, threat peace and security of Europe and even
hurt the national interests of their countries.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe the three countries would face many
Gordian knots after joining NATO.
</P>
<P>
First, with limited economic power, it would be very hard for
them to bear their share of expensive defense obligations of NATO.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that the NATO enlargement would cost about 35
billion U.S. dollars. The United States has promised only 2
billion dollars and the other NATO members have agreed to give 16
billion dollars. Naturally, the rest will have to be covered by
the new members themselves.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the three countries would find it difficult to
coordinate their relations with both Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
With contradictions between Europe and the United States
increasing day by day, the three countries will have to measure
their steps so as to offend neither of them, though both
geographically and historically they feel closer to West Europe.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, they would find it difficult to handle their relations
with Russia and their non-NATO neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Russia always strongly opposes the NATO's eastern expansion. On
Thursday, in a statement, the Russian foreign ministry made it
clear that the NATO expansion would not be constructive to trust
and stability in the international relations, rather it would only
create new rifts in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Therefore the three countries need to make painstaking efforts
to manage well their traditional relations with Russia and the non-
NATO countries in the future.
</P>
<P>
Joining the NATO is just the beginning of something new for the

<HEADLINE> Iran Offers New Gas Projects on Tenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran will put two gas projects on
international tenders to develop the giant offshore South Pars gas
field, Managing Director of the Pars Oil and Gas Company Asadollah
Salehi-Forouz announced on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Salehi-Forouz told reporters that the details of the projects
to develop the fourth and fifth phases of the gas field will be
introduced next week, the state-run radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The two projects on a "buy-back" scheme are expected to produce
two billion cubic feet of natural gas and 80,000 barrels of liquid
gas every day, he said, adding that the projects will cover 10
drilling sites, two offshore platforms and two 105 kilometers
long gas pipelines.
</P>
<P>
The South Pars gas field, the biggest one in the world with a
reserve of 7 trillion cubic meters of gas, is shared by Iran and
Qatar in the Gulf, the Iranian official said.
</P>
<P>
French Total, in partnership with Russia's Gazprom and
Petronas of Malaysia, signed a two-billion-U.S.-dollar deal in
1997 to develop the second and third phases of the field.
</P>
<P>
Salehi-Forouz said that 25 percent of the first three phases,
with a total investment of 3 billion dollars, has been
finished. And the daily production of the three phases will be 3
billion cubic feet of gas and 120,000 barrels of liquid gas.

<HEADLINE> China Builds Ecological Province in Hainan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- China's southernmost province of
Hainan plans to build itself into the nation's first ecological
province, said a Hainan leader, Du Qinglin, who is here attending
the ongoing Second Session of the Ninth National People's Congress
(NPC), China's top lawmaking body.
</P>
<P>
"Hainan plans to build this largest special economic zone in
China into a tropical ecological island within ten to 15 years,
featuring special ecological scenes, environment of first-rate
quality, burgeoning ecological agriculture and better-protected
ecological sources." Du Qinglin said.
</P>
<P>
The Hainan Island, the second largest of the country next to
Taiwan, covers an area of 34,000 square kilometers, ranking one of
the best in China in environment quality with its rich tropical
natural resources including more than 4,000 species of tropical
plants.
</P>
<P>
The plan for the next five years spells out as to maintain the
first-rate environment quality, achieve the highest forest
coverage rate in the nation, curb deforestation, keep industrial
pollution under control, protect natural resources, expand
ecological industries, and improve the life quality of the local
residents, according to the deputy.
</P>
<P>
"Hainan has focused on sustainable economic development from
the very beginning, paying equal attention to economic development
and environment protection," Du said, adding "Hainan's pillar
industries of tropical agriculture, tourism and high and new
technologies also tally with its goal of building an ecological
province."
</P>
<P>
Hainan will focus its ecological agriculture on developing and
producing wholesome green food such as tropical fruits, vegetables,
and tropical cash crops, the deputy said.
</P>
<P>
Also, Hainan will stress the prevention and control of water
and air pollution, step up afforestation, and restore coral reef,
develop ecological tourism and educate the residents to realize
the objective of building an ecological province, Du Qinglin said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Expects Low Inflation, Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- With various economic reform
programs in place, the Philippine government hopes that the
manageable inflation level, the stability of the peso and low
interest rates will continue despite a projected 49.6-billion-peso
(1.24 billion U.S. dollars) budget deficit this year.
</P>
<P>
Director General of the National Economic and Development
Authority Fellpe Medalla said Saturday that the government expects
the inflation rate to drop to 7.5 percent at the end of this year,
as compared to 9.5 percent last year, which means the rate remains
at a manageable level.
</P>
<P>
"Our projection is that the inflation rate will go down to 7.5
percent," he said in the weekly radio-TV program of President
Joseph Estrada broadcast Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The president and Secretary Benjamin Diokno of the Department
of Budget and Management both said in the program that the
interest rate, which is now 10.3 percent, will continue to go
down, especially now that the country has almost recovered from
the ill effects of the Asian currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
The president said a stable peso has helped restore investor
confidence in the economy.
</P>
<P>
"Our investors no longer get nervous because we now have a
stable peso rate at 38 peso to 39 peso to the dollar," the
president noted.
</P>
<P>
Medalla noted that because of the administration's free market
policies and commitment to keeping the Central Bank independent of
the government, the peso has settled at its current rate, which he
said is reasonable enough not to threaten domestic industries
which have to compete with low-priced imported goods.
</P>
<P>
"If the dollar is cheap, that's good because we can buy crude
oil, and other imported goods at low prices. But bringing down the
value of the dollar against the peso at a very low rate is not
good because this will threaten our local businessmen. We think
the 39-40 peso rate is a good balance," he said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Go on With Privatization Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State General
Abdulsalami Abubakar said that the Nigerian government is forging
ahead with privatization of the public enterprises despite
opposition of the People's Democratic Party (PDP).
</P>
<P>
General Abubakar said that PDP leaders, like any other
individual, are entitled to their own opinion, but the Nigerian
government will continue with the privatization process, the Post
Express reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar made the remarks on his way to capital Abuja from
Lagos Friday. He said that the Privatization Committee set up by
the Nigerian government is working on modalities for the process.
</P>
<P>
Senator Anietie Okon, national publicity secretary of the PDP
which won the February 27 presidential election, early this week
asked the current military government to halt the planned
privatization of the sensitive sectors of oil, energy and
telecommunication.
</P>
<P>
Okon said that the PDP is worried about the undue haste with
which the military government is implementing a project of such
fundamental importance to the survival of the nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
He explained that privatization cannot be rushed and should not
be conducted in such a manner that would convey the impression
that the exercise is simple to allow some powerful Nigerians
"pocket our national inheritance."

DAR ES SALAAM, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania is now invaded by
hordes of army-worms which have devastated hundreds of acres of
crops in many parts throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
A source from the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives,
according to Saturday's Daily Mail, has said the outbreak of
army-worms in central Morogoro and Dodoma, southern Iringa and
Mbeya regions have caused extensive damages.
</P>
<P>
However, he said local governments have taken steps to destroy
the worms and there should be no fear among the farmers in the
affected regions for famine.
</P>
<P>
"From available records, the outbreak of army-worms is very
much related to the rain seasons," he said, adding "The worms
appear anytime when the short rains are scanty and the long rains
are delayed."
</P>
<P>
Army-worms have destroyed an estimated 500 acres of crop in
Dodoma Region, but the situation is under control as the
authorities have provided more than 700 liters of pesticide to
farmers.

<P>
LAGOS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- International Monetary Fund
Director Michel Camdessus is scheduled to visit Nigeria next week
for two-day talks on debt issues and economic reforms, The
Guardian reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted an IMF official as saying that Camdessus will
arrive in Nigeria on March 17 and meet government officials over
the implementation of an IMF-backed program signed early this
year.
</P>
<P>
The IMF chief will also meet IMF officials in the west African
country and hold talks with Nigerian business leaders and heads of
mission from the Group of Seven industrial nations in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
He had originally been scheduled in Nigeria in January but
delayed the visit because of the financial crisis in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a western diplomat as saying that the question
of Nigeria's debt burden had been discussed "in negative terms"
last week at a meeting of the Paris Club of international
creditors and further discussions would be held later this year.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook who visited Nigeria
earlier this week said his government is willing to assist Nigeria
in tackling its debt problem if the in-coming (Olusegun) Obasanjo
government demonstrates a responsible approach to governance.
</P>
<P>
Cook noted that Nigeria's debt management credential had been
severely damaged by the late (Sani) Abacha regime which he said
had refused to pay its due to international financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Head of State General Abdulsalami Abubakar had since
his assumption of power last June been pleading for a rescheduling
of the country's debt which is estimated at 30 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The west African country is yet to resume debt repayments and
until it does so, and its in-coming civilian government sets out
its economic plans, little movement is expected on the issue,
according to western diplomats involved in debt talks Friday.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique's Cashew Nut Union Requests Change of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 13 (Xinhua) -- An senior official of Mozambique's
National Trade Union of Cashew Nut Industry has urged a change in
export policy concerning unprocessed cashew nuts and an immediate
stop on such export so as to protect the country's cashew nut
processing industry.
</P>
<P>
Guilherme Chavane, general secretary of the union said here
Friday that the three cashew nut processing factory in the capital
Maputo and its environs will soon be paralyzed due to lack of raw
materials and 900 of the total 1,300 staff workers of the
factories, mostly women, are to lose their jobs, the Noticias
newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chavane believed that the Mozambican government and the World
Bank should be responsible for the current situation, for under
the latter's pressure, the country implemented a free export
policy regarding unprocessed cashew nuts, which caused bad
consequences to the national industry.
</P>
<P>
The trade union had held several meetings recently to seek for
a way out for the situation. It also made a law draft on the
reviving the cashew nut industry and hoped the draft would soon be
approved by the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique is the world's No.1 cashew nut producer, with an
annual output of as high as 390,000 tons. However, the protracted
civil war and lack of management have brought down the production
to 60,000 tons in the recent years, of which about 40,000 tons are
exported while the rest can hardly meet the needs of the 18
processing factories around the country.

BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- State Environmental Protection
Administration Director Xie Zhenhua said here today that China
will focus this year's efforts on tackling environmental problems
affecting national economic growth and human health.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a national environmental protection work conference
which opened this morning in the Chinese capital, Xie said major
efforts will center on controlling emissions, in addition to
ensuring that all industries meet discharge standards and all
major cities meet environmental quality standards.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that local environmental departments should strive
to improve environmental quality levels in major cities, river
valleys and coastal areas. Related departments should work
diligently to protect their respective ecological environments in
order to guarantee the safety and overall quality of the nation's
environment.
</P>
<P>
Local governments are responsible for controlling emissions and
should enhance supervision and inspection to ensure enterprises
meet discharge standards, Xie told the meeting, which drew leading
officials from local environmental departments throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
The director said new projects likely to create pollution
problems should not be approved and obsolete production facilities
and methods should be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
He urged local governments to close small enterprises creating
serious pollution problems and vigorously promote the use of clean
production methods for all industries.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Implement Death Penalty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has
decided to implement the death penalty to help curb sharply-rising
crimes in the country, the Presidential Secretariat announced
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The government will also follow a more stringent policy in
granting remission of sentences imposed by courts, said a press
release by the secretariat.
</P>
<P>
The release said that death penalties will be carried out in
cases of murder and drug-trafficking with the consent of the
judge, the attorney general and the minister of justice.
</P>
<P>
General amnesties will be granted only on the occasion of the
Independence Day instead of on six occasions annually under
current practices, the release said.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has death penalty in its law, but has not carried out
an execution since 1956. Death sentences are normally commuted to
life imprisonment by the president.
</P>
<P>
Death penalties commuted to life imprisonment will not be
further reduced to a specific jail term until the prisoner has
served a period of at least 20 years in prison. Nor will the
prisoner be eligible for any remission under general amnesties
till then, the release said.
</P>
<P>
It added that persons convicted of serious crimes such as rape,
child abuse, robbery, unauthorized possession of firearms, acts of
terrorism and drug-trafficking are not eligible for the above
remissions.

Xie noted that more than 80 percent of major polluters in
eastern coastal areas and at least 70 percent of related
operations in central and western regions will be required to meet
waste emission standards by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of pollution control at the nation's
capital Beijing, and urged the municipal government to continue
requiring the use low sulfur coal and clean fuel in a bid to
reduce serious air pollution and substantially improve the local
atmospheric environment by October 1, the 50th anniversary of the
People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
"Motor vehicles failing to meet state emission standards should
be removed from the capital's roads," said Xie, adding that equal
efforts should be placed on curbing construction dusts and
cleaning rivers.
</P>
<P>
Xie said the government will continue to limit or close mines
producing high sulfur coal in acid rain and sulfur dioxide
pollution control zones, and will ban the construction of new coal-
fired power plants around major cities.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Border Trade in Southwest China Starts to Pick up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Border trade in southwestern
China is picking up, indicating greater potential for trade with
southeast Asian nations, according to deputies from those regions
to the current session of the Ninth National People's Congress,
the nation's highest lawmaking body.
</P>
<P>
"Border trade in Yunnan went up 76 percent last year, with
export turnover more than double the 1997 figure. We can see from
this fact an optimistic prospect for border trade with neighboring
countries in southeast Asia." said NPC deputy Li Xianwu, a leading
trade official in Yunnan.
</P>
<P>
One year ago, border trade in southwest China plunged as a
result of the southeast Asian financial crisis, which caused
widespread pessimism among Chinese economists about the prospect
of border trade with southeast Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
"Viewing from the current situation in Yunnan, not only border
trade expanded, foreign economic cooperation also rebounded
strongly. Total amount of fund involved in economic cooperation
projects between Yunnan and Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar soared more
than five times last year over 1997," Li Xianwu said.
</P>
<P>
Also, border trade in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region rose by
more than 60 percent last year, according to NPC deputies from the
region. Statistics show that Guangxi's border trade turnover for
the past ten years exceeded three billion yuan, up more than seven
times.
</P>
<P>
Mo Jun, a deputy from Guangxi, said, "Economies of China and
Vietnam are complementary, we export industrial products to
Vietnam and import raw materials from the country. Hence border
trade between the two countries has a very bright prospect in
spite of the plunge in the previous two years as a result of the
Asian financial crisis."
</P>
<P>
Another factor behind the rising border trade was the measures
the Chinese government has taken to promote the trade, which
include readjusting taxes, upgrading infrastructures in border
areas, and eliminating irrational levies, Li Xianwu said, adding
that "provincial governments in southwest China also have stepped
up exploring neighboring markets by all means."
</P>
<P>
"Neighboring countries have also eased restrictions on border
trade in order to lessen their internal economic pressure," he
noted.

<HEADLINE> Indian Parliament Passes Patents Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The Indian Parliament passed
the controversial Patents Bill (amendment) Saturday after heated
debates and a three-month delay.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which was passed Friday in Lok Sabha, the lower
house, was approved Saturday by Rajya Sabha, the upper house,
amidst protest walkout by some opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which replaces the Presidential ordinance, was first
passed in Rajya Sabha last December, but it failed to go through
in the Lok Sabha and the government had to make further
amendments.
</P>
<P>
During the heated debate which lasted for four hours Saturday
in Rajya Sabha, Industry Minister Sikander Bakht rejected the
opposition charges that it was against national interests,
explaining that it must be passed before the April 19 deadline to
fulfill the government commitment to the World Trade Organization
(WTO).
</P>
<P>
On Friday, some opposition parties accused the coalition
government of keeping the parliament in dark over crucial
recommendations of the Law Commission, which said the bill
contained certain clauses detrimental to national interests.
</P>
<P>
In its report on February 18, the commission urged the
government to make more amendments to the bill to protect nation
interests.
</P>
<P>
However, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has managed to
get support of the main opposition party, the Congress, without
which the bill could not be passed.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- After the departure of Oskar Lafontaine from the government,
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder will have to be strong in
front of the employers. Happy with the resignation of Lafontaine,
German employers plan to continue their fierce fight against the
fiscal reform and other projects of the government.
</P>
<P>
-- Serbs and Kosovo ethnic Albanians will return to Paris on
Monday to eliminate the blockades which appeared during the talks
in Rambouillet three weeks ago. But the chances for a success of
the conference of ultimate resort are becoming slim, as the two
sides of the conflict have so far failed to accept the peace plan
presented by the six-nation Contact Group.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said that the reform
programs prepared by former Minister of Finance Oskar Lafontaine
would be carried out as it is planned on March 19, but he did not
exclude the possibility of making "corrections" on these plans.
Experts predicted that with the departure of Lafontaine, the risk
of recession which threatened Germany would move away. The stock
exchange of Frankfurt rose by 5.13 percent on Friday.
</P>
<P>
-- Seven presidential candidates will contend in the
presidential election of Algeria to be held on April 15 to succeed
President Liamine Zeroual. The moderate Islamist Sheikh Mahfoud
Nahnah was eliminated from the list of candidates because of his
lack of documents proving that he had participated in the
Independence War, as required by the Constitution.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Go on With Privatization Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State General
Abdulsalami Abubakar said that the Nigerian government is forging
ahead with privatization of the public enterprises despite
opposition of the People's Democratic Party (PDP).
</P>
<P>
General Abubakar said that PDP leaders, like any other
individual, are entitled to their own opinion, but the Nigerian
government will continue with the privatization process, the Post
Express reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar made the remarks on his way to capital Abuja from
Lagos Friday. He said that the Privatization Committee set up by
the Nigerian government is working on modalities for the process.
</P>
<P>
Senator Anietie Okon, national publicity secretary of the PDP
which won the February 27 presidential election, early this week
asked the current military government to halt the planned
privatization of the sensitive sectors of oil, energy and
telecommunication.
</P>
<P>
Okon said that the PDP is worried about the undue haste with
which the military government is implementing a project of such
fundamental importance to the survival of the nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
He explained that privatization cannot be rushed and should not
be conducted in such a manner that would convey the impression
that the exercise is simple to allow some powerful Nigerians
"pocket our national inheritance."

<HEADLINE> Army-worms Cause Heavy Loses in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania is now invaded by
hordes of army-worms which have devastated hundreds of acres of
crops in many parts throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
A source from the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives,
according to Saturday's Daily Mail, has said the outbreak of
army-worms in central Morogoro and Dodoma, southern Iringa and
Mbeya regions have caused extensive damages.
</P>
<P>
However, he said local governments have taken steps to destroy
the worms and there should be no fear among the farmers in the
affected regions for famine.
</P>
<P>
"From available records, the outbreak of army-worms is very
much related to the rain seasons," he said, adding "The worms
appear anytime when the short rains are scanty and the long rains
are delayed."
</P>
<P>
Army-worms have destroyed an estimated 500 acres of crop in
Dodoma Region, but the situation is under control as the
authorities have provided more than 700 liters of pesticide to
farmers.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 13 (Xinhua) - The Philippine government is
adopting a "growth-with-equity" strategy under its medium-term
development plan to ensure that poor Filipinos enjoy the full
benefits of the government's program to pump prime the economy and
implement market-friendly reforms.
</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada said this strategy does not involve
"quick-fix" solutions with only short-term gains but a six-year
program that will ensure sustained economic growth and lasting
benefits for the masses even beyond his administration.
</P>
<P>
The government is now conducting multisectoral consultations to
gather feedback and inform the public about its vision and
programs embodied in this medium-term plan.
</P>
<P>
"Our medium-term development plan is from 1999 to 2004. That's
already planned. That's why we cannot solve the problems ailing
the poor outright. The funds for pro-poor programs will have to be
appropriated by Congress, and implemented by the Department of
Budget and Management," he said Saturday on his weekly radio-TV
program.
</P>
<P>
The president said this growth-with-equity strategy is the
reason why his administration is focusing on the modernization of
the agriculture sector and the implementation of labor-intensive
infrastructure projects in the countryside.

landed its troops and took over the northern third of the island
in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island,
but the peace talks between the two sides have been stalled since
summer in 1997.
</P>
<P>
It is Kasoulides' second European tour this year aimed at
briefing his counterparts and other officials on efforts to
settle the Cyprus issue and to promote the country's bid to join
the European Union (EU).

<HEADLINE> Iraq Rejects All Initiatives on Iraqi Issue: Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 13 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi daily newspaper said on
Saturday that Iraq rejects all the initiatives submitted to the
U.N. Security Council on the Iraqi issue and demands the total
lifting of the U.N. sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In an editorial published on Saturday, the daily Babil, owned
by President Saddam Hussein's elder son Udai Saddam, added that
Iraq also rejects the French initiative which, among others, was
forwarded following the mid-December U.S.-British air strikes on
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
It said that Iraq is not concernd with any amendments to the
French initiative being carried out in the U.N. Security Council,
though some members of the Security Council are trying to press
Iraq to accept the proposal.
</P>
<P>
France in January proposed to the Security Council to only lift
the oil embargo imposed on Iraq following its 1990 invastion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
It also proposed that a new weapons monitoring regime should
be established to replace the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in
charge of eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has voiced its rejection of the French proposal, arguing
that it had not been consulted with it before the initiative was
made.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Russia also put forward initiatives following the
French proposal. The Russian proposal is similar to the French
one.
</P>
<P>
In its initiative, U.S. proposed to allow Iraq to sell as much
oil as its wants to purchase food and medicine for its people,
but insisted on keeping UNSCOM in place.
</P>
<P>
The editorial hailed the Iraqi leadership's stance in
rejecting all those initiatives and insisting on demanding the
total lifting of the U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council did not agree on any of the
initiatives. After a series of counsultations, however, the
Security Council decided to establish three panels to review all
the aspects of Iraq's relations with the U.N..
</P>
<P>
The three panels, which deal with Iraq's disarmament, the
humanitarian situation and the alleged Kuwaiti prisoners of war
and archives respectively, are entitled to make recommendations
to the Council by April 15 on what more needs to be done to
close all the files.

DHAKA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The implementation of Coastal
Afforestation Program undertaken by the Bangladeshi government at
a cost of 1.23 billion taka (24.7 million U.S. dollars) for all
the 12 coastal districts is progressing, an English daily
newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Forest Department (FD) is implementing the program to
create a coastal greenbelt for the protection of the people of the
coastal districts and their property from the cyclonic storm which
visits the areas every year causing damages, the Independent said.
</P>
<P>
The FD has fixed 1,300 kilometers of embankment and 5,096
kilometers of road for afforestation under the program, and set up
150 private nurseries for producing 28 million saplings for
distribution. Besides, it has also taken up the training of 2,100
persons for the implementation of the afforestation program.
</P>
<P>
Now, the FD has decided to bring the premises of educational
institutions, religious institutions, local clubs and the house of
the distressed families, for home tea gardening under the program.
</P>
<P>
However, the report does not mention when the program will be
completed.

<HEADLINE> Employment Outlook Remains Poor in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The labor market deteriorated
in 1998 in Singapore as a result of regional economic crisis and
the employment outlook for this year remains poor as the pace of
recovery in the job market is expected to lag behind that of the
economy, says the Labor Market 1998 Report released Saturday by
the Singapore Ministry of Manpower (MOM).
</P>
<P>
Demand for labor is expected to remain weak in 1999 despite in
recent months market sentiment have improved with the view that
the worst for Asia is over and that a recovery could be seen
possibly in the second half of the year, MOM Permanent Secretary
Tan Chin Nam told a press conference Saturday morning for
releasing the report.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, total employment in 1998 contracted by
23,384, a sharp reversal from 1997 which saw an overall net
employment gain of 120,280 spread across all sectors. The
full-year decline was the first since the economic recession in
1985/86 in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Total number of persons retrenched in 1998 hit 29,068, nearly
three times the 9,784 retrenched in the previous year and
surpassing the 19,529 laidoffs in the last recession in 1985.
</P>
<P>
For the whole year of 1998, job vacancies averaged 18,342, a
60-percent decline compared with 42,065 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In December 1998, the actual unemployment rate without
adjusting for seasonal factors was 4.6 percent with an estimated
88,700 persons unemployed, reemployment rate of local retrenched
workers dipped to 59 percent form 63 percent in June of the same
year, job openings fell to a new low of 12,630, and there were
only four job openings for every 10 job seekers, a severe drop
from the average of 25 openings in the non-recessionary years in
the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing employment was the hardest hit contracting by
27,574 in 1998 while the construction sector also registered a net
decline of 4,680 jobs, its first since 1988.
</P>
<P>
However, overall employment in service sectors increased by
8,638, but the employment change within the various services
industries was uneven. Employment shrank in the wholesale and
retail trade, financial institutions, hotel-restaurants as well as
transport and communications, but community and social services
and real estate and business services reported net employment
gains.
</P>
<P>
Tan also said that the MOM has made significant progress in key
areas after it activated manpower action plan six months ago and
launched the 4R initiatives including re-deployment of retrenched
workers, renewal of workforce, realignment of employment practices
and revitalization of employment creation.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Closes 38 Insolvent Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
Saturday afternoon announced the closure of 38 insolvent banks
while putting seven others under government management.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced by Coordinating Minister for
Economy, Finance and Industry Ginandjar Kartasasmita at a news
conference at the State Secretary here.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Bambang Subianto, Bank Indonesia Governor
Sabirin and representatives from the International Monetary Fund
(IMF), World Bank and Asian Development Bank (ADB) were also
present on the occasion.
</P>
<P>
Describing the decision as a decisive step towards
restructuring the private domestic banking system, Ginandjar said
that this is the culmination of months of careful evaluation and
planning, conducted with support from the IMF, World Bank and ADB.
</P>
<P>
"A key objective of these measures is to retain an important
element of private ownership and management in the banking
system," he added.
</P>
<P>
The actions undertaken by the government to deal with the 128
private domestic banks fall into four main groups, according to a
press release.
</P>
<P>
First are category A (with capital adequacy ratio of more than
4 percent) banks, numbering 73. The government has determined that
these banks meet Bank Indonesia's minimum capital adequacy
standards, and can compete effectively without any public
financial assistance.
</P>
<P>
Second are 9 category B (with capital adequacy ratio of between
minus 25 percent and 4 percent) banks that have been determined as
eligible for recapitalization by the government to bring them to
the minimum capital requirements.
</P>
<P>
Capital adequacy ratio is the ratio between capital and
risk-weighted assets.
</P>
<P>
Third are 7 category B banks that have been taken over by the
government Saturday, and fourth are the 38 banks that have been
closed. And the fate of another bank, Bank Ganesha, will be
decided within one week.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Bambang emphasized that these steps are a
significant part of the government's ongoing efforts to establish
a safe, efficient and competitive banking system.
</P>
<P>
"We recognize that it will take some time and considerable
effort to rebuild our banking system, but we are determined to
stay the course," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sabirin reiterated that all deposits in private domestic banks
continue to be guaranteed by the government.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to assure the banking public that these reforms
will in no way affect the safety of their deposits," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government's announcement was due on February 27, but was
postponed for two weeks in an attempt to give banks more chance to
inject fresh cash and revise business plans as well as to provide
the government with ample time to assess the business plans.
</P>
<P>
Banking reform is at the heart of the Indonesian government's
efforts to bring the economy back on track.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement with the IMF, the Indonesian government
closed 16 commercial banks found unhealthy in November 1997. On
April 4 last year, the government froze the operation of seven
private banks and put seven others under the supervision of the
Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency. Four months later, the
government froze the operation of three banks and took over the
ownership of four other banks.
</P>
<P>
The IMF is organizing a 43 billion U.S. dollar bailout for
Indonesia. The fund has already disbursed some 9 billion dollars
from its own commitment of 11.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
It is expected to disburse another one billion dollars if its
board of directors approves the letter of intent, which has yet to
be completed by the Indonesian government.
</P>
<P>
Ginandjar has said that the letter of intent would be submitted
immediately after the launching of the bank restructuring
measures.

<P>
CAIRO, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Italian Defense Minister Carlo
Scognamiglio is due to arrive in Cairo on Monday for a four-day
visit, Italian ambassador to Egypt said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Scognamiglio is to hold talks with his

<HEADLINE> Iran Says Afghan Peace Depends on Broad-based Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister
for Asia-Pacific Affairs Mohsen Aminzadeh has said the success of
the Afghan peace talk depends on an agreement of Afghan groups on
establishment of a broad-based government.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the local daily Iran News published on Saturday,
Aminzadeh said Afghan peace talks will yield positive results only
when all Afghan groups agree to setting up a broad-based
government.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks over the Afghan peace talks which opened in
Ashkhabad, Turkmenistan on Thursday. However, he said that due to
the situation in Afghanistan, it is still early to comment on the
peace initiative.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan warring parties have reached a consensus on
"important points" during the ongoing talks, the U.N.
representative at the talks Andrew Tesoriere said on Friday, but
he declined to give details.
</P>
<P>
Aminzadeh underlined that as long as Afghan factions believe
that they can gain power through military means, no peace
initiative will succeed.
</P>
<P>
"Political understanding between Afghan groups is always
uncertain and therefore, the United Nations and the powerful
countries of the region should adopt measures to ensure the
establishment of peace and security in that war-torn country,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Iran supports peace talks between the
Afghan warring factions, saying the peace initiatives by the
U.N. as well as those by the "6+2", Afghanistan's six neighbors
plus the U.S. and Russia, have been useful.
</P>
<P>
Terming the Afghan Taliban as one of the Afghan groups,
the Iranian official stressed that the Afghan problem will be
resolved only when all Afghan groups contribute to peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official agreed with the reports that Iran's
policies regarding the Afghan crisis have not been successful.
</P>
<P>
"To some extent these reports are true," he said, "however, we
must say that the policies of other countries as well as those of
international organizations regarding Afghanistan have also
failed. The Afghan people are still suffering."
</P>
<P>
Referring to Iran's relations with the Afghan Taliban,
Aminzadeh said that an expansion of ties between Tehran and
the Taliban is contingent upon the latter's identification and
punishment of the murderers of eight Iranian diplomats and an
reporter in Mazari Sharif in northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban have adopted some positive measures, including
the return of the remains of the killed Iranians, the release
of captured Iranian drivers and their trucks and the repair of
Iranian consulate in Mazari Sharif.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban forces stormed the Iranian consulate in Mazari
Sharif and killed the eight Iranian diplomats and the reporter
inside it when they took over the stronghold in northern
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Aminzadeh said Iran held talks with the Taliban
regarding the punishment of murderers of the Iranians upon the
Taliban's request and added that further talks on other issues
depend on the punishment of the murderers.

said Friday that Uganda is resolved to modernize itself through
education.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when presiding over the function marking
the eighth congregation of the Institute of Teacher Education at

He said that education reform is essential in order to improve
the quality of education and make it more relevant to the needs of

Education should be at the heart of both personal and community
 development so that the people can develop their talents and
realize their creative potential, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Proper training for teachers as the most important facet of
education reform should be emphasized, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Commending the institute for being responsible for teacher
training at all levels, Museveni said he is glad that the
institute has expressed its positive response to the education
reform policy by continuously reviewing curricular and syllabi at
different levels as well as introducing new programs and
innovations to social needs.
</P>
<P>
He further reaffirmed the government's total commitment to
universal primary education as an essential ingredient for
national development and modernization.

Nanhaizi near Baotou City, an industrial base of the region.
</P>
<P>
After the bombing, large ice blocks flowed downstream the river
and the section is expected to melt in a few days.
</P>
<P>
Over 20 km long sections of the Yellow River in the region had
remains frozen blocking the flow of ice blocks from the upper
reaches of the river.
</P>
<P>
Ice on the river has kept melting for the past few days,
although the region is still in grips of a cold spell, leaving
only two sections of ice layer at Sanshengong and Nanhaizi near
Baotou City.
</P>
<P>
The level of obstructed icy water kept rising under the Yellow
River Highway Bridge in Baotou, imposing pressure to the traffic
of a national highway and a nearby power plant. Some parts of the
levee are in danger of overflowing.
</P>
<P>
As a result, China's air force was ordered to implement a
bombard mission last night.
</P>
<P>
The country has been using planes to bombard the ice on the
Yellow River since the 1950s. Icebreakers can't be used, because
the river has a great deal of silting.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines National Police
(PNP) in Central Quezon province was placed on red alert following
plans of the New People's Army (NPA) rebels to attack five towns
in the province.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from the PNP Intelligence Office, the
five towns to be attacked by the rebels are Pagbilao, Mauban,
Agdangan, San Francisco and San Narciso.
</P>
<P>
The PNP Provincial Command is on red alert because of the
possible attacks of the rebels and threats to some policemen from
the nearest town in the province.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, NPA rebels from the Southern Tagalog Regional Party
Committee will celebrate their anniversary on March 29.
</P>
<P>
Major Danilo Leyba, spokesperson of the Southern Luzon Command
(SOLCOM), said the attack of the rebels will be done because of
the recent decisions of the president not to suspend the rescue
operations of the three military officials kidnapped by the NPA
rebels.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Army Put on High Alert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese Army was put on high
alert Friday night after three Israeli helicopter formations
ranged deep into northern and eastern Lebanon, the Voice of the
People radio reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Lebanese Army units observed three Israeli helicopter groups
over Beirut, the Ibrahim River area in north Lebanon and Shmustar
village in the eastern Bekaa," the radio quoted a military source
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The helicopter gunships had been joined by warplanes, the
source added.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese troops, mainly anti-aircraft units, were put on
alert to face any possible aggression, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Sources of the United Nations peacekeeping troops stationed in
south Lebanon said that the area under their control in the south
was quiet and no resistance attacks were reported.
</P>
<P>
The heightened tension came hours after Israeli Defense
Minister Moshe Arens termed Lebanon as a "powderkeg" ready to
explode if Hezbollah continue its attacks on Israeli forces.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after meeting with visiting U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen, Arens said that "Lebanon, under control of Syria,
has become a powderkeg."
</P>
<P>
"There is no way of telling how far it could escalate if
Hezbollah terrorist actions are not halted," Arens added.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with a claimed aim of protecting its north from
cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to
oust Israeli forces out of the country.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, a total of seven Israeli soldiers, including a
general and three officers, were killed in less than a week in
Hezbollah's ambushes.
</P>
<P>
The deadly attacks prompted Israel to launch massive
retaliatory offensives against Hezbollah targets across the
country.

<HEADLINE> "Let Me Unfold a New World for You": Young Conductor (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Audience in Beijing will have an
opportunity to watch a concert conducted in a Russian style by a
young Chinese musician.
</P>
<P>
Lin Tao, 28, who has been in Russia for 10 years, will conduct
the concert of Asian Musicians Concert Series tonight at the
Beijing Concert Hall.
</P>
<P>
"Symphonic Dance" composed by Rachmaninoff (1873-1943) will be
played at the concert. This autobiographic piece of Rachmaninoff,
reflecting a vagabond life the Russian composer led for the rest
of his life, challenges a conductor in technique and artistic
expression as well.
</P>
<P>
"He cries, I cry; he laughs, I laugh," said Lin, "It seems that
I have followed the wondering life of the great master when I
conduct this piece," Lin said.
</P>
<P>
The Asian Musicians Concert Series were given by the China
National Symphony Orchestra (CNSO) for outstanding Asian musicians
to display their achievements made in symphony. Lin was invited to
one of such concerts by Maestro Chen Zuohuang, CNSO's first
artistic director and conductor.
</P>
<P>
"The CNSO and I have forged good mutual understanding, and we
have had very pleasant cooperation," said Lin, adding that he is
willing to develop the cooperative relations with the national
symphony orchestra, which he believed is the best in current China.
</P>
<P>
Lin cherished the honor to be invited to the concert. He saw
the concert an examination because some of his teachers from the
Central Conservatory of Music would be among the audience.
</P>
<P>
Ten years of studying and living in Russia visualized Lin's
learning on Russian art and culture, which would run into Lin's
imagination when he conducted playing of Russian classic music.
</P>
<P>
"That is why some Russian art critics and audience smelt
Russian smack out of my conducting," said Lin, whose style was
described by Russian media as more Russian than Russian conductors.

<TEXT>
<P>
"I'm just luckier and work harder than others," said Lin, who
has conducted over 300 concerts in European countries including
Russia and Spain.
</P>
<P>
Lin, who received double master's degrees of composing and
conducting as well as a doctoral degree of conducting from Moscow
National Conservatory of Music, conducts mostly playing of
European classic.
</P>
<P>
He tried to introduce some classic Chinese music to Russian
audience. "I found a passionate echo from the audience that was
totally out of my expectation," Lin recalled.
</P>
<P>
Lin has been shuttling back and forth between Moscow and St.
Petersburg for several years, since he was immediately invited to
be assistant conductor for both St. Petersburg Kirov Theater and
St. Petersburg Philharmonic after he won the honor in the contest
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
"I could learn from the masters and even practice by myself,"
Lin said, "it was tough for me to continue study in Moscow and
work in St. Petersburg at the same time, but the experience
benefited me greatly."
</P>
<P>
"I'm only an infant facing world masters," he said.
</P>
<P>
"When a young conductor appears in front of an orchestra, the
first reaction from the orchestra is "what can you do" in most of
the cases," Lin said frankly.
</P>
<P>
By showing what he could do, Lin has been able to gain
authority in front of different orchestras he had cooperation with.
</P>
<P>
"As a conductor, I try my best to interpret what composers want
to express as a translator does. I hope my audience can touch it
in heart through performance of the orchestra," Lin said, who
believes that the most important responsibility of a conductor is
to be loyal to composers.
</P>
<P>
"Music changes in the twinkling of eyes, and my heart responds,
" he said, "I have been entirely melted into music."
</P>
<P>
Every time I conduct, I feel like that I open a window which
enables audience and I to view a completely new world," Lin said,
"the more I see, the more enriched I will be."
</P>
<P>
Lin hoped that he would be able to find an ideal job in China
so as to join people in making contributions to popularization of
symphony in China, which he believed needs more people to devote
to.
</P>
<P>
"The conditions are much better than those of two decades ago,"
he said, "I'm confident that more Chinese will be fond of classic
music in the future."

MANILA, March 13 (Xinhua) - A top Philippine official has cited
the urgency of a global approach to the implementation of

<P>
HONG KONG, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Members of the public were
urged Saturday to take part in a community tree-planting scheme in
support of enhancing a green countryside in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by the chairman of Country and Marine Parks
Board (CMPB), Dr Tam Wing-kun, at the launching ceremony for this
year's scheme.
</P>

Fisheries Department (AFD) of Hong Kong received this year, as
more than 20,000 applicants had been enrolled in the past two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
Tam said AFD had planted more than 1.8 million tree seedlings
in the past five years and more than 40 percent of these were
local species.
</P>
<P>
He said AFD would enhance the territory's afforestation plan in
the coming year, with the objective of developing a countryside
with richer species and more diversified habitats.

be increased in order to provide better habitats for wildlife," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the ceremony, Director of Agriculture and
Fisheries Lessie Wei said that about 10 local corporations would

<P>
NAIROBI, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Kenya has launched a nation-wide
road rehabilitation project with a loan of 5.9 billion shillings
(about 92.5 million U.S. dollars) in a bid to restore the roads
destroyed by the 1997 El Nino rains.
</P>
<P>
Some 4.9 billion shillings came from the World Bank and the
rest from the African Development Bank, major Kenyan newspapers
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the launch of the El Nino Emergency Project (ENEP)
Friday in Mombasa, a port city bordering the Indian Ocean,
Minister of State Julius Ole Sunkuli said the loan for the project
covered only 40 percent of the rehabilitation costs, while the
rest of the money will be drawn from a fuel levy fund and from
other development partners.
</P>
<P>
The repairs will give priority to roads, bridges and drainage
systems in 36 districts and seven urban centers identified as the
worst affected, Sunkuli said, adding the repair works will
commence countrywide within three months and Mombasa will have 45
kilometers of damaged roads repaired.
</P>
<P>
He warned domestic and foreign road contractors that the
Kenyan government will not accept shoddy work in road
rehabilitation.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thai Govt Wins Battle over Bankruptcy Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The long-brewed bankruptcy bill
in Thailand cleared the Parliament Friday night, after the Senate
heeded government pleas to keep harsh measures intact.
</P>
<P>
The passage of the bill is seen not only as a victory for the
government, but more importantly, a necessary step leading to a
smooth economic recovery, analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
The bankruptcy bill, one of the essential parts of the
financial reform package crucial to Thailand's economic recovery,
was drawn by the government and put to the Senate on Friday for
the final reading.
</P>
<P>
But earlier, a vetting committee of the Senate had suggested
some drastic amendments to the draft bill, aiming to offer
increased protection to borrowers against creditors.
</P>
<P>
The proposed changes would prevent creditors from filing
bankruptcy cases if pledged collateral was sufficient to cover any
outstanding debt. Guarantors would not be held responsible if a
bankruptcy case was filed against borrowers.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a borrower held by the courts to be bankrupt would
have his record cleared after one year. The committee also
proposed to protect at least 100,000 baht (2,702 U.S. dollars) in
personal assets and the homes of bankrupt borrowers.
</P>
<P>
The proposed changes were rejected by the government, which
argued that accepting the changes would destroy the credit system
and aggravate problems faced by the financial system.
</P>
<P>
The Thai financial system is laboring under the weight of
non-performing loans of more than 2.7 trillion baht (72.9 billion
dollars), or more than 45 percent of total outstanding credit.
</P>
<P>
Pending the final vote on Friday, business leaders and major
newspapers voiced support to the government.
</P>
<P>
Chairmen of the Thai Bankers' Association, the Federation of
Thai Industries and the Board of Trade in Thailand issued a joint
statement supporting the government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Bangkok Post and the Nation, two major English
newspapers, said in their Friday comments that the vetting
committee's proposals were unacceptable because it would destroy
"a culture of responsibility in which people are accountable for
their business decisions and contracts," and it would also destroy
"a culture under which loans must be repaid otherwise the
financial system would fall apart."
</P>
<P>
The firm stances adopted by both the government and the Senate
vetting committee had created a deadlock before the vote Friday,
as each side was trying to hold the other responsible for
rejecting compromise.
</P>
<P>
However, compromises were reached in Friday's vote when the
government agreed to accept the amnesty for persons discharged
from bankrupt status, but increased the one-year waiting period to
three years.
</P>
<P>
The government also agreed to increase the lowest amount of
debt liable for bankruptcy action to one million baht (27,027
dollars) for ordinary persons and two million baht (54,054 dollars
for legal entities, as proposed by the vetting committee.
</P>
<P>
At last, senators voted 162-1 with one abstention to pass the
bill in the final reading.
</P>
<P>
The bill will have to go back to the House of Representatives
because changes were made, but the lower chamber looks certain to
agree with all the changes before the bill becomes law.
</P>
<P>
Together with the foreclosure bill passed earlier Friday and a
bill to establish a bankruptcy court adopted two weeks ago, the
financial reform package has now cleared the legislative hurdle.
</P>
<P>
But it also means that there is little excuse left in the
legislative area for the government to seek when trying to bring
the country's economy back on track.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda confidently predicted a
bottoming-out of the economy this year with some positive signs
emerging next month.
</P>
<P>
He is planning to jump-start the economy through a 53 billion
baht (1.45 billion dollar) state spending program and a tax cut
package.
</P>
<P>
However, both Thai economists and foreign agencies considered
Tarrin's prediction too optimistic, taking into account the lack
of team work, delays in disbursing funds into real sector and the
worsening banking crisis.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, The passage of the bankruptcy bill and other key
economic bills gives a big boost to the government' reform
efforts, although it at the same time poses greater challenges for
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai and his economic team, analysts said.

<HEADLINE> 60 Percent of Arrests in India Unjustifiable: Justice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Sixty percent of all arrests by
the police in India were "unnecessary and unjustifiable", chairman
of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) Justice M. N.
Venkatachaliah said Friday.
</P>
<P>
These accounted for 43 percent of the total expenditure
incurred by prisons, the NHRC leader said while addressing a group
of district and sessions judges and officers from correctional
services.
</P>
<P>
In Delhi's Tihar Jail, according to the Times of India
Saturday, only 10 to 15 percent of the inmates were convicts, the
rest being under trials.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted Venkatachaliah as saying that most of the
complaints reaching the NHRC relate to the police and it was
reportedly said that even innocent people with mental disabilities
were sometimes being held in prisons.
</P>
<P>
"There is a very low rate of conviction as the investigations
carried out leave much to be desired," he said. "The degree of
acquittals is very demoralizing for the public as the offenders
get away scot-free."
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China Sets New Car Exhaust Emission Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The State Bureau of Quality and
Technical Supervision (SBQTS) of China recently promulgated a set
of new standards on car exhaust emissions.
</P>
<P>
The new standards will become effective as of January 1, 2000
in an attempt to allow a longer period of preparation for existing
car producers.
</P>
<P>
The new standards are made according to the car exhaust
regulations of the UN Economic Commission for Europe and exhaust
emissions of new cars in China will be similar to the standard of
European countries in the early 1990s upon operation of the new
standards, said an official with the SBQTS.
</P>
<P>
China now has approximately 13 million motor vehicles, and the
number is expected to exceed 20 million by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Urban air quality reports regularly released by the State
Environmental Protection Administration show that auto emissions
have become a main source of air pollution in some major cities.
</P>
<P>
Environmental experts estimate that the annual emission of
harmful gas by motor vehicles across China can reach tens of
millions of tons.

<HEADLINE> Moldovan New Government Wins Vote of Confidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Moldova's parliament Friday
approved, by a tight vote of 52 to 50, the seventh cabinet headed
by Ion Sturza and its platform, which heralded an end to the
republic's month-old political crisis.
</P>
<P>
However, the vote of confidence has been won not as a result of
the settlement of the disputes over the assignment of ministerial
posts within the ruling coalition, but because of a critical vote
gained through technical means.
</P>
<P>
The decisive vote came from deputy Ilie Ilascu, imprisoned in
the Moldovan break-away region of Trans-Dniester since 1992 for
alleged terrorism. Ilascu sent his favorable vote for the new
government from prison by mail.
</P>
<P>
His vote was decisive because the Constitutional Court refused
to validate parliament's approval of Sturza by 51-50 last week,
deeming it unconstitutional and sending the move back for another
vote.
</P>
<P>
Moldovan President Petru Lucinschi nominated Sturza as prime
minister on February 19 and again on March 9. The parliament
rejected the first nomination by 101 to 51 votes.
</P>
<P>
On the second nomination, the president urged the parliament to
make a compromise to pave the way for the forming of the
government and threatened to dismiss the parliament for early
elections if the new government was vetoed again.
</P>
<P>
Lucinschi is due to approve the new cabinet later in the day.
The new government will be sworn in right after the approval.
</P>
<P>
Sturza, 38, served as the deputy prime minister in the last
cabinet in charge of economic affairs. The president believed he
would be capable of steering the country out of the current
economic crisis because the new premier understands the country's
economic well-being and has a good rapport with international
financial bodies.
</P>
<P>
Moldova is beset with severe financial and economic
difficulties. It currency, the leu, lost half of its value in 24
hours in November after the central bank said it would not prop it
up.
</P>
<P>
Inflation hit 18.3 percent in 1998 and is expected to slip to
about 15 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Former premier Ion Ciubuc resigned last month amid differences
with his ministers on the pace and degree of economic reforms.

HANOI, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Polish President Aleksander
Kwasniewski will pay an official visit to Vietnam from March
17-20, it was officially announced here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Kwasniewski, the first Polish head of state to visit Vietnam in
40 years, is making the journey at the invitation of Vietnamese
President Tran Duc Luong.
</P>
<P>
Kwasniewski's upcoming visit aims to consolidate and develop
the traditional friendship and cooperation between the two
countries, enhance mutual understanding, boost trade and
investment, and create conditions for expanding outlets for Polish
goods in Vietnam, according to official report.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam and Poland established diplomatic relations in 1950.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to Poland by former prime minister Vo Van Kiet
in 1997, the two countries agreed to promote multi-cooperation in
transport and communications, minerals, food processing and
trading. Two-way trade is estimated at 80-100 million U.S. dollars

<HEADLINE> Norway to Further Cut Oil Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Norwegian Minister of Oil and
Energy Marit Arnstad said on Friday that his country was ready to
reduce its oil production to back the international move to prop
up oil prices by curtailing oil output.
</P>
<P>
Arnstad made the remark in Oslo after energy ministers from
four member countries of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) -- Algeria, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, as
well as non-OPEC Mexico agreed to cut oil output after two days of
negotiations at the Hague meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian minister, however, made no specific commitments,
as any move to cut oil production in the country must be first
approved by the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Last spring, Norway decided to reduce its daily oil production
from the North Sea oil fields by 100,000 barrels by the end of
1998 to support the world oil producers' bid to limit oil output.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, the oil production cut was extended to
this coming summer.
</P>
<P>
Norway is the largest oil producer in western Europe and the
second largest oil exporter in the world, with an annual output of
oil and natural gas of 200 million tons in oil equivalent.

<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria's National Assembly
approved Friday the principles of a national strategy for the
development of the energy sector until 2010.
</P>
<P>
Following a five-hour debate, 197 parliament members voted in
favor and four abstained -- two from the Bulgarian Socialist Party
(BSP) and two from the Alliance for National Salvation (ANS).
</P>
<P>
Taking the floor, representatives of all the parliamentary
groups also supported the stance of the government that units one
to four of the Kozlodoui nuclear power plant, on the Danube,
should be decommissioned after the expiry of their service life
and after the construction of replacement facilities.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has been demanding Bulgaria shut down the
four units of the Kozlodoui nuclear power plant in line with a
1993 agreement signed between the two sides, saying Bulgaria
should fulfill the demand before it becomes an EU member.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria, however, repeatedly rejected the EU's demand on
grounds that the decommissioning of the four units will cost
Bulgaria a large amount of money and it cannot finance the
decommissioning projects since the money promised by the EU for
the decommissioning has not been received yet.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian parliament on Friday mandated the Government to
open talks with the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (EBRD), the European Commission and other
international institutions and to negotiate mutually acceptable
terms and conditions for meeting the commitments assumed in regard
to the power industry.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian cabinet will have to adopt a technological plan,
supported by a concrete financial program, for upgrading units
five and six of the Kozlodoui Nuclear plant and rehabilitating
several thermoelectric power stations.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Industrial Production Index Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's index of
industrial production (IIP) for January 1999 dropped by 11.2
percent compared with the same period of last year, the Statistics
Department said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The IIP for January 1999, which stood at 134.7, also fell 8.9
percent compared with the index of 147.8 for December 1998,
according to the department's IIP figures released Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The lower index for January this year from a year earlier was
attributed solely to the drop of 15.7 percent in the manufacturing
division index to 133.5 from 158.3.
</P>
<P>
Among a total of 23 major groups in the manufacturing division,
only two -- footwear and industrial chemicals -- recorded higher
indices for January 1999, while the remaining 21 groups registered
lower indices.
</P>
<P>
The IIP for the mining division and the electricity division
rose by 1.7 percent to 129.5 and by 0.7 percent to 161.6
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the mining index was due to the rise in the
indices of tin and natural gas while the higher index in the
electricity division was due to the 0.7 percent growth in the
generation of electricity to 4,591 million kilowatt-hours (1999)
from 4,560 million kilowatt-hours (1998).
</P>
<P>
The IIP is a measure of the rate of change in the production of
industrial commodities in real terms over time.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica Pleased with Central American Trade Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Costa Rican government is
satisfied with the Central American treaty on the solution of
trade disputes signed Thursday in Guatemala by the ministers of
economy and foreign trade of Guatemala, El Salvador and Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican Foreign Trade Minister Samuel Guzowski said Friday
that the signing of the treaty is a milestone in the Central
American integration process.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica started a campaign last May to conclude a treaty on
this matter to achieve an effective modernization of the scheme of
Central American economic integration, said Guzowski.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, he said, the isthmus governments and
private sectors will have "a juridical mechanism to resolve
commercial controversies out of the political agencies, following
a rapid, secure and foreseeable procedure," he said.
</P>
<P>
Guzowski said that the treaty is an important contribution to
the strengthening of the rule of law in Central America.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, along with the Regulation of Measures of
Normalization, Metrology, and Authorization Processing and
Regulations of Measures and Sanitary and Phytosanitary Procedures,
will be signed in the near future by Honduras and Nicaragua, whose
ministers did not attend the meeting held Thursday in Guatemala.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Central Bank Urged to Relax Money Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Economic Planning Secretary Felipe
Medalla said the Philippine Central Bank should provide room for
further monetary expansion to achieve at least a 2.6-percent
growth in gross domestic product this year, a local newspaper
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Medalla was quoted by Philippine Daily Inquirer as saying that
the attainment of the growth target would largely depend on
whether loan growth would pick up to stimulate more economic
activities.
</P>
<P>
"The central bank should be more expansionary at this time
because I'm worried about the lending numbers," Medalla said.
</P>
<P>
He said loan growth in December last year, for instance, slowed
down by 4.8 percent compared to year-ago levels. If loan growth
fails to pick up this quarter, Medalla said, the country might not
hit its growth targets this year.
</P>
<P>
"We can either downscale it or work harder to attain it through
more reform measures," he said.
</P>
<P>
One reform measure which should be accelerated to perk up
economic growth was the liberalization of retail trade, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the central bank should exercise further
moral suasion to encourage banks to be more aggressive in lending,
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Under the macroeconomic program with the International Monetary
Fund, the central bank will allow domestic liquidity to grow by 15
percent this year compared to last year's 13.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the central bank has lowered its internal ceiling for
this year to 13.9 percent to ensure that there would be no excess
liquidity that could exert pressure on inflation or be used by
banks to speculate against the peso.

<HEADLINE> Albania FM: Ethnic Albanians to Sign Accord Before Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Foreign Minister Paskal
Milo said Friday he believed the Kosovo ethnic Albanians will sign
the peace agreement with Serb negotiators before the Kosovo peace
talks resume Monday in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Milo told his visiting Bulgarian counterpart Nadezhda
Mikhailova that the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) is carefully
studying procedural issues for the signing of the agreement and
that he understood the ethnic Albanian delegation would sign the
deal before flying to Paris for talks with the Serb delegation.
</P>
<P>
Milo also warned that Belgrade would face all consequences if
it failed to ink the agreement before the Paris peace talks ended.
</P>
<P>
Albanian Prime Minister Pandeli Majko told Mikhailova during a
meeting on Friday  that Albania is urging the ethnic Albanians to
accept the deal and is hopeful the ethnic Albanian delegation
would do so.
</P>
<P>
Mikhailova promised that her country supports greater autonomy
for the southern Serbian province of Kosovo and believes that it
is necessary for an international force to enter Kosovo to
guarantee the implementation of the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Under strong international pressure, the Serbs and the ethnic
Albanians have accepted an autonomy deal for Kosovo that was
hammered out during 17 days of negotiations at the French chateau
of Rambouillet last month.
</P>
<P>
However, neither the Serbs nor the ethnic Albanians have yet
signed the deal. Belgrade also rejected the deployment of NATO
troops in Kosovo to secure peace.

<HEADLINE> New Oil Output Cut to Stabilize Market: Mexican Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Mexican Energy Minister Luis
Tellez said Friday the new oil output cut agreed on with Saudi
Arabia, Iran, Algeria and Venezuela of more than two million
barrels a day will stabilize the world market and slightly raise
the price.
</P>
<P>
The ministers of energy of the five major oil producing
countries agreed at a meeting held in The Hague to reduce by two
million barrels a day their daily crude output starting April 1.
</P>
<P>
It was not known how much each country will reduce its
production.
</P>
<P>
Tellez said that the oil producing countries reduced the supply
of oil by 3.1 million barrels a day in 1998, a measure that
stopped the drop of the international prices, which reached their
lowest levels of the last 22 years.
</P>
<P>
This effort achieved a slight and brief price recovery, but it
dropped again because of the persistence and the worsening of the
international financial crisis in the second half of 1998, said
Tellez.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (
OPEC) will announce their production cuts during the organization'
s next meeting on March 23 in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
Tellez said Mexico's crude supply cut will be announced before
April 1.
</P>
<P>
Mexico is a major oil producer and exporter, producing some
three million barrels per day of crude oil.

<HEADLINE> Peru Reinforces Watch Along Border With Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian Defense Minister Gen. Julio
Salazar Monroe Friday announced that the Peruvian armed forces
have reinforced 17 border surveillance posts to check infiltration
of Colombian guerrillas and drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
Salazar told the press upon his return from the border region
that more military and police posts had been created in the
Peruvian border village of El Estrecho, on the Putumayo River
banks.
</P>
<P>
The Peruvian press has denounced recently intensified
activities of Colombian drug traffickers and loggers in Peruvian
Amazonia.
</P>
<P>
Colombia and Peru share a 1,600-kilometer-long border, of which
a natural line is the Putumayo River.
</P>
<P>
The Peruvian defense minister said that the troops sent to
reinforce the Peru-Colombia border were retired from the border
with Ecuador and that some of them had been concentrated in a
military base in the jungle town of Iquitos, some 1,600 kilometers
northeast of Lima.
</P>
<P>
The minister inspected the reinforcement of the border,
accompanied by Interior Minister Julio Villanueva and advisor to
the National Intelligence Service Vladimiro Montesinos.
</P>
<P>
Salazar said the movement of the Peruvian forces was ordered
some weeks ago by President Alberto Fujimori "to counter the
advance of Colombian terrorists and drug traffickers."

<HEADLINE> Hungarian Leaders Hail Entry into NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Hungary's accession to NATO has
brought about new changes to the political balance in central and
eastern Europe, shattering the world configuration under the Yalta
accord since World War II, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban
said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a NATO flag-lowering ceremony at the Dutch embassy,
Orban said the occasion indicated the end of the embassy's mission
of liaison between Hungary and NATO (North Atlantic Treaty
Organization).
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian government staged a number of celebrations to
mark the country's entry into NATO on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a televised address Friday, President Arpad Gencz described
the entry as "a historic event" which proves the credibility and
the realistic approaches of the country's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Among the first three former Warsaw Pact countries to accede to
NATO on Friday were also Poland and the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
The ambassadors of Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic
issued a joint statement Friday saying the three countries' entry
into NATO will consolidate Europe's security and help eliminate
threats to it.
</P>
<P>
Five major political parties in the country issued statements
supporting the country's NATO membership.
</P>
<P>
But some other parties and social organizations are against
NATO's expansion, claiming Hungary's accession to NATO would be
detrimental to the country's independence and bring about new
problems and economic burdens to the country.

<HEADLINE> Nearly 500,000 Child Laborers in Sri Lanka: ILO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 13 (Xinhua) -- There are nearly 500,000 child
laborers in Sri Lanka and about 10,000 are living permanently on
the streets, said the International Labor Organization (ILO) in
its latest report.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed at a seminar held recently in Colombo to
deliberate on the ratification of Convention No.138 which
stipulates the minimum age of 15 years for admission for
employment in the country.
</P>
<P>
The report, quoting recent statistics of government and
non-governmental sectors and organizations, said the common forms
of child labor seen in Sri Lanka are domestic employment,
involuntary begging on the streets, child prostitution, work in
the informal sector and work in the tourist fishing and gemming
industries.
</P>
<P>
The number of child laborers in the 10 to 14 age group has
gradually decreased in recent years. In 1990, over 80,000 children
were employed while in 1998 it dropped to 39,000.
</P>
<P>
There are about 30,000 child prostitutes, according to national
and international estimates, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Sri Lankan law, no child under 14 could be
employed in industry or commerce and no child under 12 could be
employed in domestic service.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka was among the first 27 fully participating countries
in the ILO's International Program for the Elimination of Child
Labor.
</P>
<P>
The ratification of the minimum age convention is one of the
key measures proposed by the ILO to combat the problem.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Rebel Group ELN Denies Assassinations Accusations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian National Liberation
Army (ELN) guerrilla group Friday denied any involvement in a
recent spate of assassinations and kidnappings over the border
with Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen of ELN, the second largest rebel group in Columbia
after the Revolutionary Armed Forces (FARC), contacted the El
Universal newspaper specifically to deny any involvement in the
abduction of a Venezuelan cattleman, Eudes Acosta, saying he must
have been taken in the state of Zulia by the common criminals who
committed the crime in the name of the ELN.
</P>
<P>
They also ruled out any part in the attack which occurred
Tuesday night in Guasdalito, a village in the state of Apura.
</P>
<P>
The attack, conducted by eight armed men dressed in civilian
clothes, caused an intense military mobilization in the air and on
land.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have expressed their willingness to collaborate with
the Venezuelan authorities investigating the crimes.
</P>
<P>
They said that the ELN Central Command would not attack
Venezuelan installations, military elements, or border bases near
the Colombian territories where they have influence.
</P>
<P>
They repeated their willingness not to commit kidnappings on
the Venezuelan soil. "We have canceled military activities on your
territory," the ELN spokesmen told El Universal.
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, ambassadors from the European Union and other
countries in Bogota called for an end to the killing of foreigners
by guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
A senior commander of the FARC Wednesday said that a local
squad leader acted without his superior's knowledge or approval in
abducting and executing three U.S. citizens earlier this month.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Mexican Foreign Ministry
announced Friday that Mexico will hold the fourth round of talks
with EU here in mid April.
</P>
<P>
A foreign ministry communique said that during the third round
Mexico-EU talks, which ended in Brussels on the same day,
delegates analyzed the access to markets, the rules of product
origin, technical standards, government acquisitions and services.
</P>
<P>
Also discussed at the talks were tariff reduction, movements of
capital, copyrights, international commercial practices, and the
resolution of disputes.
</P>
<P>
The EU is anxious to reach a trade agreement with Mexico. Since
Mexico joined the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in
1994 with the United States and Canada, EU trade with Mexico has
dropped by half. Mexico's access to the EU market has also fallen.

<HEADLINE> N.Zealand-Australian Joint Currency not on Agenda:PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister
Jenny Shipley said on Saturday that a joint New Zealand-Australian
currency is not on the agenda of the prime ministerial taskforce
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
A media release issued by the New Zealand Prime Minister's
Office said the Auckland-based New Zealand Herald Saturday
"incorrectly quoted the Prime Minister as saying the taskforce
would look beyond the issues" outlined by Shipley and her
Australian counterpart John Howard during the latter's visit to
New Zealand last month.
</P>
<P>
During Howard's visit to New Zealand, The two prime ministers
decided to establish a New Zealand- Australian taskforce to sort
out issues outstanding from the Closer Economic Relations Trade
Agreement (CER) between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Since the CER agreement was signed in 1983, New
Zealand-Australian trade has increased by 275 percent with their
trade standing at 5.4 billion U.S. dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper implied that a controversial issue on a New
Zealand-Australian joint currency, which has recently been
discussed in New Zealand media, is on the agenda of the taskforce.
</P>
<P>
"This is not a currency taskforce. A joint currency is not on
the agenda," Shipley said in the release.
</P>
<P>
She said the taskforce would focus on barriers and costs to
trans-Tasman investment and some other issues, and also examine
future directions for CER, including further steps within CER to
strengthen economic ties, and extending CER's links with other
countries.
</P>
<P>
The strengthening of economic ties within CER does not include
"consideration of a joint currency," Shipley said.
</P>
<P>
"A unified currency is not being considered," she said. "I have
 always said I see no reason why we should consider it."

<HEADLINE> Blatter Calls for Changes in Soccer World Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- FIFA president Sepp Blatter said
his organization will have a radically revised world calendar by
2005 with fewer domestic matches and better coordination of
international play.
</P>
<P>
Blatter said international competition would run through a
calendar year, with events starting in February and being finished
by the end of November, a contrast to the traditional European
season, which begins its league and cup competitions in July-
August and conclude in May.
</P>
<P>
The changes should put an end to problems national teams
gathering a full squad for matches or tournaments because of
conflicts with club schedules.
</P>
<P>
Domestic leagues, which include up to 20 clubs in England and
Spain, would be reduced to 16 teams each. About 44 weeks would be
set aside for up to two games a week, and it would be specified
which dates are available for domestic league and cup competition,
continental club championships and international matches.
</P>
<P>
However, Blatter said the plans would not stop individual
countries from holding their cup competitions when they wanted.
</P>
<P>
Continental championships would take place in even-numbered
years, Blatter said. Some, such as the South American event, are
presently held in odd-numbered years.
</P>
<P>
December would be a month when "everyone will put their feet up
", while January would be available for preparation and some
matches, such as the planned World Club Championship.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Jet Violates Accord, Flying Near Cable Car: Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. jet which killed 20
tourists in the Italian Alps last February should not have been in
the air at all under the Italy-NATO accord of 1997, Italian
military investigators said Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the accord, only flights of F-16 fighter bombers
were authorized in the area of the accident, the Mt. Cermis ski
resort in the Dolomites in northeastern Italy.
</P>
<P>
Italian military investigators said that prowler military
reconnaissance jets like the one piloted by Marine Captain Richard
Ashby, acquitted of negligence last week, were supposed by the
accord to move their training missions in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Ashby's jet also broke all the rules on such flights, which set
a minimum altitude of 600m, but Ashby hit the ski-lift cable at
about 100m above the ground, said the investigators.
</P>
<P>
Italian judicial sources said it was possible that a new
indictment might be sought by Italian prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, residents near the NATO Aviano air base Friday urged
the government to ban all flights in the surrounding alpine
valleys.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers acting for the victims' families also wrote a letter on
Friday to Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema urging him to see that "
the killer pilot remain silent" after what they took as "insincere
apologies" issued since he was acquitted.
</P>
<P>
In Warsaw, during his visit to Poland Friday, D'Alema repeated
his demand for justice to be done.
</P>
<P>
"If justice does not come, Italy will press for a revision of
the 1951 London Convention which assigned jurisdiction in such
cases to the home nation of the NATO personnel," he said.

<HEADLINE> China's Transportation Peak Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- China's transportation sector has
handled more than 1.5 billion passengers during the 40-day "Spring
Festival Travel Period", which has always witnessed the country's
largest population flow in a year.
</P>
<P>
The passenger volume was up 3.1 percent on an annual basis in
the travel season that started from February 1st to March 12,
according to the release from the State Economic and Trade
Commission.
</P>
<P>
The festival is the most important one for Chinese people, when
people head home for family reunions or migrate to urban areas to
find jobs.
</P>
<P>
Demand of all transportation means was strong, except the water-
bound, whose volume dropped by 13 percent to 27 million.
</P>
<P>
The railway transportation witnessed an 8.2 percent increase of
passenger volume to 123 million and those by travel buses peaked 1.
397 billion, representing a surge of three percent. The civil
aviation sector saw the biggest growth margin of 10.8 percent and
it handled 6.65 million trips.
</P>
<P>
There were more people spending their one week-long Spring
Festival holiday traveling this year, which substantially boosted
the passenger volume.

<HEADLINE> Ecuadorian President Unveils Austerity Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Ecuadorian President Jamil Mahuad
Friday announced a series of strict measures to raise revenues
with new taxes and to ensure that the wealthy pay their taxes in a
bid to relieve the country's worst financial crisis in decades.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after the board of directors of Ecuador's
Central Bank resigned Thursday as a nationwide strike protesting
the government's economic policies entered the second day.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank President Luis Jacome, who also quit his post, had
been under attack for allowing Ecuador's currency, the sucre, to
float last month, causing its value to dive sharply by 83 percent.
</P>
<P>
Banks across the country remained shut for the fourth day in a
row after President Mahuad ordered an emergency bank holiday to
prevent mass withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two days, police have arrested 235 demonstrators,
using tear gas to disperse protesters, while the government
imposed a 48-hour state of emergency.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators, led by Ecuador's trade unions, want the
government to change its austerity economic measures, announced by
Mahuad last September, which include fuel subsidy cuts and a wage
freeze.
</P>
<P>
The government's political opponents have accused Jacome of ill-
implementing Ecuador's fiscal policy and criticized Mahuad of
acting too slowly to right the economy.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador is locked in its worst economic crisis in recent
decades, caused by low oil prices and floods resulting from El
Nino last year. Oil is the country's major hard currency earner.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador's inflation is running near 50 percent, the highest in
Latin America, and its currency lost a quarter of its value last
week.

<HEADLINE> IOC Commission Recommends Expulsion, Warning against Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The IOC ad hoc Commission
investigating the conduct of certain IOC members on Friday
recommended severe punishments against those accused of improper
conduct arising from the Salt Lake City Olympic bid process.
</P>
<P>
In a press released received here on Saturday, the six-member
commission headed by vice president Dick Pound of Canada, said in
its second report that it has examined the conduct of 17 IOC
members as the 18th member Charles Mukora of Kenya resigned from
the IOC and was not included in the final report.
</P>
<P>
The commission confirmed its previous recommendations that five
IOC members be excluded from the organization, namely Agustin C.
Arroyo of Ecuador, Zein El Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gadir of Sudan, Jean-
Claude Ganga of Congo, Lamine Keita of Mali and Sergio Santander
Fantini of Chile.
</P>
<P>
It further recommended one additional expulsion against Paul
Wallwork of Samoa.
</P>
<P>
Based upon the evidence presented in the investigation, the
commission also recommended warnings or varying degrees of
severity by the IOC Executive Board against nine IOC members
including Un Yong Kim of South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The other eight members are Phillip Walter Coles of Australia,
Louis Guirandou-N'Diaye of Ivory Coast, Willi Kaltschmitt Lujan of
Guatemala, Shagdarjav Magvan of Mongolia, anani Matthia of Togo,
Austin Sealy of Barbados, Vitaly Smirnov of Russia and Mohamed
Zerguini of Algeria.
</P>
<P>
The commission also recommended that three members be
exonerated of the allegations made against them and were cleared
of misconduct, they are Henry Edmund Olefemi Adefope of Nigeria,
Ashwini Kumar of India and Ram Ruhee of Mauritius.
</P>
<P>
In the report's conclusions, the commission stated that "the
commission fully recognizes that the IOC must take action. The
commission is aware that the IOC is prepared to do so. The IOC
must also implement reforms to ensure that these types of problems
never occur again."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the commission called on bid cities and National
Olympic Committees to do a better job of following the rules
specifically outlined in all bid city documents.
</P>
<P>
"Bidding cities are entitled to expect more guidance in these
matters from their National Olympic Committees. They should not be
left more or less on their own in the process. At the same time,
the IOC acknowledges that it could have put in place more
effective controls from its own perspective to monitor the
situation," the report said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the recommendations for actions against certain
members, the commission also reaffirmed its endorsement of reforms
it put forth in its initial report on January 24. These included
adoption of significant changes in the host city election process,
limitations on travel by IOC members to bid cities and the
creation of a permanent, independent Ethics Commission.
</P>
<P>
The recommendations for expulsion, which have gone to the IOC
Executive Board, will be presented to the full IOC membership
which will be meeting in extraordinary session on March 17-18 in
Lausanne.
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of the IOC's membership must vote to exclude a
member, who has the right to speak before the full session. And it
is unclear at the moment as to how many of the five members who
are facing expulsion will be speaking.

exemption to continue his recovery from a prolonged knee ailment.
</P>
<P>
Among the veterans, only Rivaldo and Cafu were starters on the
Brazilian team that lost 3-0 to France in the final of the World

part of Luxemburgo's preparation of an under-23 squad for the 2000
Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
Also in the roster were talented 21-year-old forward Roni of
Rio's Fluminense, who scored 20 in the division A last year, and
Juninho, the playmaker of Copa Libertadores champion Vasco da Gama.

<HEADLINE> ECB Head Raps Euroland Governments Over Public Finances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Wim Duisenberg, president of the
European Central Bank (ECB), rapped Euroland governments Friday
for letting public finances drift away from the guidelines set for
European economic and monetary union.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Rome at a conference organized by British weekly
The Economist, the head of ECB urged governments to implement the
structural measures necessary to keep spending under control in
the medium and long term.
</P>
<P>
"A rigid application of the Pact for Stability and Growth by
each of the euro area's member countries is essential," Duisenberg
said.
</P>
<P>
"Progress in trimming euro area budgets has not been
sufficiently consolidated," he added, pointing out that public
debt was still too high and budget deficits were too close to the
limit of three percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
In reference to calls from politicians for an interest rate cut
to boost Euroland's flagging economy and help create jobs,
Duisenberg said unemployment should be tackled with flexibility in
labor markets and precisely targeted incentives.
</P>
<P>
Countries such as the Netherlands, Ireland, Portugal and
Austria had been able to contain rising unemployment thanks to
their highly flexible labor markets, he said.
</P>
<P>
Duisenberg also urged Euroland governments to counter slow
growth with action instead of words.
</P>
<P>
"If governments shoulder their responsibilities and respect the
tasks and objectives set in the Maastricht Treaty, they will be
making the best possible contribution to guarantee the euro area
solid foundations and stability," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Women Steal Limelight at All England Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BIRMINGHAM, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese women stole the
limelight of the All England Open Badminton Championships here on
Friday, taking three out of four seats on offer in the women's
singles semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
The only other place was grabbed by top seed Camilla Martin of
Denmark, who defeated Chinese rival Gong Ruina 11-3, 4-11 and 11-5
in a quarter-final match.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, shuttlers from Denmark and Indonesia dominated the
men's singles, sharing the places in the top four.
</P>
<P>
Gong Ruina, gold medalist from the Sweden Open last week, was
not match to Martin in the first set, surrendering at 11-3.
</P>
<P>
In the second set, the Chinese woman increased her attack and
had a complete control of the pace, levelling the score at one-all
with smashes and strokes.
</P>
<P>
Martin said after the match that she attributed failure in the
set to Gong Ruina's fast speed. "When I got used to it, I had
already lost it," she said.
</P>
<P>
In the third and final set, Martin played long rallies to Gong,
who, with weaker strength and power, had no chance to smash at the
net.
</P>
<P>
"I used long rallies to control Gong in the third set," Martin
said. "It proved right."
</P>
<P>
Martin will meet world champion Ye Zhaoying in the semi-final.
Ye, who lost to Martin in their recent meeting, defeated her
teammate Gong Zhichao 11-6 and 11-8 for the top four.
</P>
<P>
Another semi-final match will be held between second seed Dai
Yun and Zhou Mi. Dai, gold medal winner at the Chinese Taipei
Open earlier this year, met no challenge from Huang Chia-chi of
Chinese Taipei in the quarter-finals, winning the match at 11-5
and 11-4.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Mi, a slow starter, rallied from first set down to win the
match against joint fifth seed Mia Audina of Indonesia 7-11, 11-4
and 11-7.
</P>
<P>
While in the men's section, first seeded Peter gade Christensen
outplayed Johan Hadikusuma of Indonesia 17-15 and 15-8 to set up a
showdown with another Indonesian Budi Santoso in the semi-final.
Santoso overwhelmed his teammate Indra Wijaya 12-15, 15-11 and 15-
6.
</P>
<P>
The other semi-final match will also be an Indonesian-Dannish
duel, with joint ninth seed Taufik Hidayat taking on joint third
seed Poul-Erik Hoyer-Larsen.
</P>
<P>
The semi-final matches are slated for Saturday.

<HEADLINE> First Trade Union for Private Sector in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, March 13 (Xinhua) -- China's first trade union
organization for the private sector was set up recently in Lucheng
District of Wenzhou City in east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The district has 1,600 privately owned small businesses with a
total employment register of 3,000 people. The union now has a
membership of 200 and its president is a waitress in a local
private teahouse.
</P>
<P>
The organization, founded at the suggestion of Nan Feiyu, vice-
president of the Self-Employed Laborers' Association in Lucheng
District of Wenzhou City, is aimed at protecting the legal rights
of employees in the private sector in line with state laws and
regulations.
</P>
<P>
Nan first muted the idea last October when he attended the 13th
national congress of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions held
in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Trade unions are allowed to be formed in government offices,
enterprises and institutions in accordance with relevant laws and
regulations. However, there are no specific guidelines on the
formation of trade unions in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Nan's idea got the support of the All-China Federation of Trade
Unions' leaders. Thus, the Zhejiang provincial trade unions
decided to take the initiative to set up such an organization in
Wenzhou on a trial basis.
</P>
<P>
The city is well-known for its rapid development of the private
economy in China. It has 205,000 privately owned small businesses
with an employment of 340,000 people. Registered capital totaled 2.
5 billion yuan and the private economy achieved 860 million yuan
in taxes in 1998, accounting for 19 percent of the city's total.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Oil Basket Price Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's crudes basket price
closed the week Friday at 9.91 dollars per barrel, 1.06 dollars
above that of last week, the Energy and Mines Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The rising trend in oil prices, which started on March 2, is
seen as a favorable reaction to the cold wave hitting the United
States, which has resulted in a bigger volume of purchases, mainly
of fuels for heating.
</P>
<P>
The Energy and Mines weekly statistics bulletin said that
another factor that contributed to the price strengthening was the
positive outlook created around the meeting held by important
producers out or within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
Major oil producers, including all OPEC members except Iraq,
are committed to cutting production from April 1 by more than two
million barrels per day (bpd), as non-OPEC members Mexico and Oman
did.
</P>
<P>
The cutbacks will be on top of existing OPEC and non-OPEC cuts
of 3.1 million bpd as agreed upon last June, exceeding five
million bpd in total.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary figures showed that the Venezuelan crude average
price for this year was 8.80 dollars and that of March is 9.38
dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan crudes basket price dropped by 5.69 dollars per
barrel, causing a loss of 43.5 percent, equivalent to six billion
dollars in government revenue.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan crudes average price for 1998 was 10.63 dollars,
while that for 1997 was 16.32 dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The skiing's world governing body
FIS cancelled the World Cup final slalom in the night in Sierra
Nevada on Friday as women racers threatened to go on strike due to
soft snow and icy conditions.
</P>
<P>
FIS did not reschedule the event, saying there was no time left
in the season, which ends Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Thus, Sabine Egger of Austria who entered as the overall point
leader in slalom, picks up her first World Cup season slalom title.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, fellow Austrian Alexandra Meissnitzer
claimed the season super-G title when similar weather wiped out
that race.
</P>
<P>
The first leg of the doomed slalom was run amid gusting winds
and blowing snow, with large pot holes on the course, and angry
racers protested about the conditions.
</P>
<P>
Pernilla Wiberg, one of four racers with a chance to win the
overall slalom title, said racers had agreed not to run the second
leg and were organizing to demand better conditions from FIS.
</P>
<P>
FIS called off the race as rumors circled in this southern
Spanish ski resort that the women were going on strike.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Producer Prices Fall 0.4 Percent in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Labor Department said
Friday that producer price index for finished foods fell a
seasonally adjusted 0.4 percent in February, the most in 13
months.
</P>
<P>
February's drop, compared with a 0.5 percent increase in
January and a 0.4 percent increase in December, showed that
inflation pressures in the production process can scarcely be
found.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said inflation's tameness is behind Wall Street's
belief that the Federal Reserve is not in a hurry to increase
interest rates, despite unexpectedly strong economic growth so far
this year.
</P>
<P>
Last month's producer price decline reflected drops of 1.4

<HEADLINE> Blair Hails Menuhin's Unique Musical Gifts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
paid tribute to violinist Yehudi Menuhin, who has died in Berlin
of heart failure at the age of 82.
</P>
<P>
Blair said Lord Menuhin's unique talent had brought joy to
millions and he would be "remembered the world over as one of the
greatest musicians of his age."
</P>
<P>
Lord Menuhin died in a Berlin hospital on Friday morning, after
arriving in the city on Tuesday for a concert that night.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, German President Roman Herzog and French President
Jacques Chirac also called Yehudi Menuhin one of the most
brilliant musicians of the century.
</P>
<P>
Menuhin was a renowned interpreter of classical and modern
music, and also famous for establishing the Yehudi Menuhin School
in Surrey, which trained other stars.
</P>
<P>
Lord Menuhin was born in New York of Russian immigrant parents,
but became a naturalized Briton in 1985 and was knighted two years
later.
</P>
<P>
He gave up public performances in his 70s, when his hearing
become impaired, but continued conducting at his school at least
once a month.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Develop Test for "Undetectable" Sports Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- German and Danish researchers said
Friday they have developed a test for growth hormone doping in
sport, which was previously regarded as undetectable.
</P>
<P>
Misuse of drugs in sport is common, but not always detected.
Some substances are particularly difficult to detect when injected,
especially those that mimic naturally occurring hormones in the
body.
</P>
<P>
Growth hormone is one such substance that is produced by the
pituitary gland in the brain, but which is also manufactured for
injection.
</P>
<P>
Until now there has been no reliable way to differentiate
between the natural and the injected hormone by blood or urine
samples, leaving athletes who abuse growth hormone able to escape
detection.
</P>
<P>
However, German and Danish researchers reported in a letter to
the Lancet medical journal that they have developed the first test
that can differentiate between naturally occurring and
manufactured hormones.
</P>
<P>
The test depends on blood being taken within 36 hours of growth
hormone injection, which, as the scientists pointed out, means
that "out of competition" testing would have to be implemented.
</P>
<P>
The researchers, led by Dr. Christian Strasburger and
colleagues at Innenstadt University Hospital in Munich, Germany,
said that the blood test also depends on blood being taken, which
is not at present the case for control samples.
</P>
<P>
But the scientists were confident that such administrative
obstacle can be overcome by the authorities in politics and sport,
in view of the serious side effects of growth hormone misuse.
</P>
<P>
"From an analytical point of view, the dogma of
'undetectability'of r-HGH (manufactured human growth hormone)
misuse no longer holds true," they concluded.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Urge IRA to Disarm, Times Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton is
expected to urge the Irish Republican Army and its political wing
Sinn Fein to give up arms, Saturday's edition of the Times
newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted an authoritative source as saying that
Clinton will next week tell Adams: "It's not viable for you to say
'it can't happen, it won't happen, it's not going to happen'."
</P>
<P>
Adams and Northern Ireland's First Minister, David Trimble,
will meet Clinton next week in Washington for St. Patrick's Day
celebrations and to try to break the deadlock on IRA disarmament.
</P>
<P>
The row on decommissioning in Northern Ireland has delayed the
transfer of powers from Westminster to the provincial assembly
from March 10 to 29 and stalled the fragile peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Times said Clinton will not demand a start to
decommissioning before Sinn Fein takes its seats on the new
executive but will say that the IRA should make clear that
disarmament can and will take place.
</P>
<P>
At the same time Clinton will urge Trimble to react positively
to any such statement from the IRA and meet them half way, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton played a crucial part in persuading Protestant
unionists and Catholic republicans to sign up to the Northern
Ireland peace deal.

<HEADLINE> Scottish Nationalists Launch Campaign to Win May Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Scotland's pro-independence
nationalist party launched its campaign on Friday seeking the
victory of the first general elections in May.
</P>
<P>
At the party congress, Scottish National Party (SNP) promised
victory over their ruling Labor party rivals in the vote for
Scotland's first parliament since it was last an independent
nation some 300 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to win... to succeed in winning equality and
independence for our country -- to be a nation again," SNP leader
Alex Salmond said in Scotland's east coastal city of Aberdeen,
according to Reuters report.
</P>
<P>
Salmond promised to hold a referendum on independence if the
SNP won control of the parliament, which will have limited tax
raising powers and be much less powerful than its Westminster
counterpart.
</P>
<P>
Polls show the SNP running slightly behind British Prime
Minister Tony Blair's Labor party. Both are far ahead of the
largest opposition party the Conservative.
</P>
<P>
SNP leaders took the biggest gamble of the campaign so far by
pledging to fight government plans to cut the basic rate of income
tax by one pence in the pound -- promising to use the 690 million
pounds (1.13 billion U.S. dollars) for health and education
instead.
</P>
<P>
The tax cut, taking the basic rate to 22 percent, was the
centrepiece of finance minister Gordon Brown's budget this week, a
move the SNP labelled an attempt to "bribe" Scottish voters.
</P>
<P>
The Labor government has grown increasingly concerned about the
May vote and Blair has visited Scotland frequently in the past few
months to warn against the independent tendency in the region.

<TEXT>

<P>
NEW YORK, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial
average moved down Friday in failure to reach 10,000 points
after the index hit 9,935.46 in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Dow closed at 9,876.35, down 21.09. The index had come
within 42 points of 10,000 in early session before pulling back.
</P>
<P>
The blue chip stock index held back from the five-digit
milestone mainly because investors decided to take profits on
the previous market surging despite more evidence that the U.S.
economy will continue to grow without inflationary threats.
</P>
<P>
The labor Department reported that the Producer Price Index
fell 0.4 percent in February after a 0.5 percent rise in
January, giving evidence that there is no inflation in
the economy.
</P>
<P>
The disappointing results for a number of companies helped
bring the index lower. Construction equipment maker Caterpillar
said its first-quarter results would fall far short of
expectations because of lower machine and engine sales.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also lower. The technology
heavy Nasdaq index was down 30.72 at 2,381.53 while the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index down 3.09 at 1,294.59.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 0.13 at 611.54 and the American Stock
Exchange index fell 0.44 at 721.21. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies was down 2.70 at 398.38.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a narrow margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,562 down, 1,406 up and 600
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 821.45 million shares from 902.62

UNITED NATIONS, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Following positive
outcomes of security assessments, the Unted Nations on Friday
announced the plan of return its international relief staff to
Afghanistan on a 2-3 week rotational basis.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, five international staff will be sent

</P>
<P>
For the third week, a UN represence will remain in Kabul and
Khandahar. The subsequent opening of UN offices in Herat and

Field Security Officers to those locations. Security arrangements
are expected to be finalised in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations said the further deployment of UN

<HEADLINE> New Car Registrations Slows Down in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The new car registrations in
Britain recorded a substantial year-by-year decrease, the
Association of European Automobile Constructors said here on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the association said in a press release, the introduction
in 1999 of a twice yearly plate system, in March and September instead
of the traditional once a year system in August, has already started to
alter the established seasonality of new car registrations in Britain.
As a result, the total Western European new car market slowed down.
</P>
<P>
The association also said the Western Europe's new passenger car
registrations in February this year totalled 1,101,548 units, which
represents a decrease of 3.7 percent relative to February last year.
While the cumulative figure for the first two months of 1999 shows a
decrease of 1.7 percent compared with the same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, the year-over-year February evolution was particularly
good in France, Greece, Ireland, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and
Sweden. At the same time, Italy showed a slight decrease of 0.4
percent compared to February 1998 but taking the cumulative figure,
the decrease is nevertheless significant.
</P>
<P>
Even though Germany shows a decrease of 3.7 percent in February,
the January-February period registered a slight growth of 0.2 percent,
the car manufacturer alliance said.

<HEADLINE> Canada Wins WTO Panel With Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Canada Announced Friday that it
scored victory at the World Trade Organization (WTO) in a
long-standing trade dispute with Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The WTO has ruled in Canada's favor on eight o ten points, and
has declared that PROEX, a Brazilian export program, is a
prohibited export subsidy that must be withdrawn without delay,
according to a release issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs
and International Trade.
</P>
<P>
The WTO ruled that Brazil did not meet conditions that grant
developing nations more time than developed nations to remove
prohibited export subsidies such as PROEX. The harmful effects of
PROEX have been most evident in the aerospace sector. Under the
program, foreign purchasers of Brazilian exports benefit from
payments that reduce financing costs to levels that undercut the
market.
</P>
<P>
"Through more than two years of consultations with Brazil,
Canada tried to solve this dispute through negotiations," said
International Trade Minister Sergio Marchi. "Today's WTO ruling
confirms Canada's assertion that PROEX is an illegal export
subsidy that must be withdrawn immediately."
</P>
<P>
A separate panel found all but two Canadian measures to be
consistent with WTO rules. These are: Canada account debt
financing for regional aircraft since 1995, and Technology
Partnerships Canada (TPC) assistance to the regional aircraft
industry.
</P>
<P>
"Canada Account debt financing for regional aircraft has only
involved two transactions since 1995, and we continue to believe
that all Canada Account financing has complied with WTO
requirements," said Minister Marchi.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the ruling on TPC assistance to the aerospace sector,
Industry Minister John Manley noted that the panel report was
narrow in scope and limited to the application of TPC to regional
aircraft. It was not critical of TPC's overall structure.
</P>
<P>
"The Canada government will continue to support research and
development and to encourage innovation and excellence in Canadian
industry, while respecting our international obligations," added
the Canadian minister.

Hor Nam Hong, Cambodia's Foreign Minister made the statement
after meeting U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, Hong said "The crimes committed by the
Khmer Rouge were committed in Cambodia, the culprits were
Cambodians and the victims were Cambodians."
</P>
<P>
Hong said it is logical to try the former Khmer Rouge
leaders in Cambodia because the country's constitution forbids
the extradition of its nationals to face justice in another country.
</P>
<P>
"We have to set up a national tribunal to try the Khmer Rouge
leaders. To respond to the international standards, we will
request assistance from foreign experts to the Cambodia court,"
Hong said.
</P>
<P>
Hong said his government's decision fits the provisions in
the Convention on the Repression and Punishment of the Crime of
Genocide as well as those of the Cambodian constitution.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard, Annan had insisted
the suspected criminals be tried by an international court
because "the Cambodia judiciary in its current state is unlikely
to meet the minimum standards of justice."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Annan also insisted on the need for
accountability and an end to impunity.

But other European markets fell back, depressed by Wall
Street's failure to hold on to its gains in midday trading and

German shares have soared amid hopes that Lafontaine's surprise

</P>
<P>
The electronically traded Xetra Dax closed the day 245.7 points

</P>
<P>
This surge wiped out all the losses of the previous four
session, leaving the index up 3.9 percent on the week.
</P>
<P>
Among the biggest winners were insurers, as they are likely to
benefit from the change of policy as well.
</P>
<P>
Uk shares struggled to build on Thursday's gains as profit
takers moved in on the oil sector.
</P>

MOSCOW, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Russia and the United States
agreed here Friday on the necessity of a peaceful solution to the
Afghanistan conflict.
</P>
<P>
During a five-hour session of consultations between Russian
Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin and U.S. Assistant

Moscow and Washington are positive that "the long-term

Interfax quoted Karasin as saying.
</P>
<P>
Karasin said the two sides also discussed practical measures in

WASHINGTON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic Friday formally joined NATO at a ceremony held in the
city of Independence, Missouri.
</P>
<P>
At the Harry Truman Library in Independence, the three foreign
ministers of Bronislaw Geremek of Poland, Janos Martonyi of
Hungary and Jan Kavan of the Czech Republic signed formal
documents of accession.
</P>
<P>
In speeches before the signing ceremony, the ministers said
their countries saw NATO membership as an assurance of security
and recognition of their rightful place in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Kavan said the Czech Republic would no longer become "the
powerless victim of a foreign invasion."
</P>
<P>
Martonyi called Hunragy's admission in NATO "returning to her
natural habitat," saying: "It has been our manifest destiny to
rejoin those with whom we share the same values, interests and
goals."
</P>
<P>
And Geremek said it was "a great day for Poland and for the
world."
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright accepted admission
papers from the three countries' foreign ministers, marking their
formal entry into the 50-year-old Western alliance. "Hallelujah,"
exclaimed Albright, a daughter of Czechoslovakia, who as a child
fled her native land and later became a U.S. citizen.
</P>
<P>
Ahead of the ceremony, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana
said that the accession of the three countries..."is perhaps the
clearest demonstration of the fact that Europe is growing closer
together."
</P>
<P>
"Extending membership to these three democracies helps to
stabilize a region that historically has been the staging ground
for many of the disasters of this century," Solana added,
referring to the two world wars.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department has said the three new members
"enhance NATO's ability to fulfill its core mission of collective
defense, respond to a range of security challenges and reduce the
possibility of another major conflict in Europe of the kind that
has claimed so many American lives."

<P>
CAIRO, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Armenian Minister of Industry and
Trade Gaik Gevorkyan on Friday hailed the signing of a trade
agreement as a turning point in his country's trade relations with
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Gevorkyan expressed his appreciation of the accord after he
signed it with Egyptian Minister of Trade and Supply Ahmed Gowaili.
</P>
<P>
He said the pact will afford "a big opportunity" to lay the
groundwork for promoting the bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
He urged Egyptian commercial banks to open branches or set up
joint banks in his country to finance the trade exchange.
</P>
<P>
The Armenian official called on Egyptian businessmen to visit
Armenia to get to know the local market and acquaint Armenian
consumers with Egyptian products, which he said have high quality
and competitive prices.
</P>
<P>
Gowaili said that opportunities are existing for Egyptian
engineering, farming and consumer goods in Armenia, where these
products are in great demand.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is aimed at enhancing the bilateral trade volume,
which lags at 4 million U.S. dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
Gevorkyan arrived here on Monday leading a business delegation
to the 32nd Cairo International Fair running on March 9-19.

<HEADLINE> NATO Formally Adds New Members From Eastern Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) becomes a 19-ally military power as the Czech
Republic, Poland and Hungary formally joined the 16-member bloc
Friday, the day NATO said opens a new chapter in the history of
the Atlantic Alliance and of Europe.
</P>
<P>
NATO's decision-making body, the North Atlantic Council, said
in a statement that it welcomes the three new Eastern European
allies who formally accede to the Washington Treaty which shaped
the organization after World War Two.
</P>
<P>
The council said that next Tuesday NATO will receive the prime
ministers of the three new members here in Brussels. "Their flags
will be raised alongside those of the other 16 member countries at
a ceremony of welcome. They will then take their seats at the
table of the North Atlantic Council as full and equal allies," it
said.
</P>
<P>
The NATO supremacy body also said that the alliance's opening
process to new countries is part of NATO's policy to improve the
security and stability environment for nations in the
Euro-Atlantic area. "The countries of Europe are moving closer
together to finally overcome the division of Europe."
</P>
<P>
At its 50th anniversary celebrations in Washington next month,
NATO will proclaim a so-called "new strategy concept" on orienting
its future direction for the alliance of 19 members: Belgium,
Iceland, Denmark, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Canada,
Luxembourg, the United States, Norway, Portugal, Turkey, Spain,
Greece, Italy, Britain, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.

</P>
<P>
But Russians -- and some Americans -- are wary about the
eastward encroachment of NATO, criticizing the enlargement as a
rejection of the common European security system.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov has called extending NATO
membership into Eastern Europe "a movement in the wrong
direction."
</P>
<P>
"All European states must cooperate in creating a joint
security system," he said. "All European states must work together
in the interests of all countries rather than of separate groups."
</P>
<P>
There were 12 original members of NATO at the time of its
founding. Since 1949, it has been expanded to include Greece and
Turkey in 1952, Germany in 1955 and Spain in 1982. The new
addition of three countries Friday brings the total to 19 and
many other hopefuls are waiting in the wings. They are Slovenia,
Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Lithuania, Estonian and Latvia.
</P>
<P>
NATO's mission has changed dramatically since its founding in
1949 and now become more ill-defined. NATO warplanes helped end
the war in Bosnia almost four years ago and now are poised to
intervene in Yugoslavia should peace efforts in the province of
Kosovo fail.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 12 (Xinhua) -- France reacted strongly Friday to
the death of world music master Yehudi Menuhin, who had close
relations with France and its capital Paris.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac said that he was greatly
saddened on hearing the death of Menuhin, who he said was a great
virtuoso of this century and a giant musician.
</P>
<P>
He said Menuhin is an instrument of peace and brotherhood who
lived for transmitting his art.
</P>
<P>
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said that Menuhin has
taught him how music is in the service of humanity.
</P>
<P>
"He showed it in his life. He is a tireless traveler for the
benefit of peace and the defense of human rights everywhere where
it is mocked at or threatened," said Jospin.
</P>
<P>
Former French Minister of Culture Jack Lang said that Menuhin
is a courageous and generous fighter whose music is without
frontier.
</P>
<P>
Mayor of Paris Jean Tiberi said that Menuhin loved Paris where
he presided over the prestigious Jacques Thibaud international
violin competition.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that the musician played solo the French national
anthem Marseillaise in the Opera of Paris at the liberation of the
city from Nazi Germany in 1944.
</P>
<P>
The general director of UNESCO Frederick Mayor said that UNESCO
has lost a great friend who served as "ambassador of goodwill" for
the organization since 1992.
</P>
<P>
The French radio station France Inter interrupted its programs
to broadcast the music played by Menuhin throughout Friday
evening.
</P>
<P>
Menuhin died of a heart failure in a Berlin hospital Friday at
the age of 82.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Three Americans arrested on Sunday
at the Harare International Airport with a huge assortment of
arms of war will appear in court on Saturday morning, Police said
on Friday in Zimbabwean capital.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Police Commissioner Augustine Chihuri told reporters
that the Americans would be charged under a section of the Law
and Order Maintenance Act which deals with acts of terrorism and
sabotage.
</P>
<P>
Chihuri said police investigations had discovered that the
Americans rented a house in Harare and another in the town of
Lubumbashi in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) where arms
of war were also recovered.
</P>
<P>
He said the Americans were on a mission of acts of terrorism,
sabotage and to destabilize both Zimbabwe and the DRC.
</P>
<P>
"They were on spying missions for rebels in the DRC and the
three had contacts in Zimbabwe," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chihuri, who was flanked by Director-General of the Central
Intelligence Organization Elisha Muzonzini and Acting Information
Director Edward Mamutse, said the excuse by the Americans that
they were hunters was just a scapegoat.
</P>
<P>
He said investigations had shown that the Americans had never
been to any hunting game park in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The police chief declined to name the Americans.
</P>
<P>
The Americans were arrested on Sunday following the discovery
of the arms of war which included AK-47 riffles, pistols,
shotguns, ammunition, binoculars and communication equipment as
they prepared to board a Swiss airplane to Zurich.

LUANDA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- An Angolan social welfare official
said here Friday that the country should pass a law to guarantee
the rights of the handicapped, most of whom became disabled in
wars against colonialism or civil wars during the past three
decades.
</P>
<P>
The Chairman of the Angolan National Association for the
Handicapped, Silva Lopes Etiambulo, said that enactment of laws
for the handicapped would help maintain social stability as the
country is having more and more beggars and armed robberies.
</P>
<P>
Etiambulo said that the country should first pass an act for
the handicapped to ensure their basic rights of living, education
and work, then give favorable treatment to them in medicare,
transportation, food, housing and bank loans.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government has made great efforts in helping
the handicapped, such as establishing a health recovery center and
working out programs for their education and employment. However,
he said the government's efforts to assist the handicapped have
faced financial constrains as the civil war continues.
</P>
<P>
Incomplete statistics of the association show that the
handicapped persons in Angola are currently estimated at 800,000,
some eight percent of the country's total population. Around
150,000 people were handicapped by land mines.

KAMPALA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Minister of State for
Education Francis Babu has denied any wrongdoing in obtaining a
certificate required for application for Master of Business
Administration (MBA).
</P>
<P>
In a statement released Friday evening, the minister said the
academic qualifications he submitted to Makerere University are an
equivalent to a first degree as verified by the Aviation Training
Association in Britain.
</P>
<P>
But he accepted the decision by the university to cancel his
admission to the post-graduate of MBA.
</P>
<P>
He was duly admitted because there were no discrepancies in his
academic qualifications but only to be dismissed six moths later,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
In a letter dated March 10 to the minister, the Academic
Registrar of the university, Hyuha Mulwanason, said the minister
had been discontinued because he did not have a first degree of
its equivalent which is the minimum requirement under the
university's rule to enrol for a MBA degree.
</P>
<P>
Some official in the university, who preferred anonymity, was
quoted by the New Vision daily as saying recently that the
minister was not admitted through the board responsible for
postgraduate studies, but through influence peddling, a charge
the minister denied.

BELGRADE, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic reiterated on Friday that his country will not allow
foreign troops to be stationed in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The president of the federal republic made this remark while
meeting Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov who forwarded a
letter written by Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic told the visiting foreign minister that the
continuation of the peace talks in Paris starting next Monday
should only conclude by reaching a political agreement, ruling out
any military means in the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
He promised that both Serbia and the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia are determined to guarantee autonomy for Kosovo within
Serbia on the basis of full equality of all nationalities and in
accordance with the highest norms of international law.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav president told the visitor that Yugoslavia would
send its delegation to Paris for the second round of peace talks
and would contribute their efforts toward reaching a political
agreement aimed at guaranteeing equal social status and rights for
all residents in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Russian foreign minister said at the meeting that his
country has been championing a political solution through peaceful
means and that Russia expects a political solution could be found
on the foundation of the peace plan formulated by the six-nation
Contact Group that consists of the United States, Britain, France,
Germany, Italy and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov stressed that Russia is opposed to either the threat of
force and the use of force against the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia and that as a member of the Contact Group, Russia has
been against the stationing of foreign troops in the Yugoslav
province.

<P>
BAGHDAD, March 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. and British warplanes
bombed some Iraqi military sites and civilian installations in
northern Iraq on Friday, an Iraqi military spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The damages and casualties of the attack were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency quoted the spokesman as saying that
around noon Friday, nine formations of U.S. and British warplanes
including F-15 and F-16 fighters taking off from Turkey violated
northern Iraqi airspace over Erbil, Dohuk and Neineva provinces.
</P>
<P>
The warplanes fired seven missiles and bombs at some civilian
facilities and anti-aircraft positions, said the spokesman,
adding that Iraqi air defenses fired back and the warplanes fled
at 3:10 p.m. local time (1210 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Confrontations between Iraqi air-defenses and the U.S. and
British warplanes patrolling the two no-fly zones have almost
become a daily occurrence over the past two months.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad announced it does not recognize the no-fly zones
following the four-day U.S.-British air strikes against Iraq last
December and would fire at any warplane violating its airspace.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and its allies imposed the no-fly zones in Iraq after
the 1991 Gulf War, with the claimed aim of protecting the Kurds in
the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from "Baghdad's
suppression."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Expects to Keep Current Bomber Fleet for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Air Force's bomber
fleet, which includes B-52s that have been flying since before the
Vietnam War, will have to last another 40 years, an Air Force's
official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Michael Ryan, the Air Force chief of staff, said 3.6 billion
U.S. dollars is being invested over the next 10 years to upgrade
the fleet -- giving it more advanced communications links and
newer precision-guided weapons.
</P>
<P>
But the Air Force does not intend to even begin planning for a
next-generation bomber until about 2013, Air Force Secretary
Whitten Peters said.
</P>
<P>
The Air Force timeline indicates that the current bomber fleet,
which totals 190 aircraft -- 93 B-1 Lancers, 76 B-52
Stratofortresses and 21 B-2 Spirits -- will be worn out by about
2037. The B-52s, which were built in 1960 and 1961, might last
until 2044, by which time they would be 84 years old.
</P>
<P>
Although the Air Force would like to bring on a new generation
of bombers earlier, it cannot afford to move faster. The main
priority in aircraft development over the next two decades will be
new fighter planes -- the F-22 stealth plane and the so-called
Joint Strike Fighter -- to replace today's F-15s and F-16s.
</P>
<P>
The Air Force estimates it spent 30 billion dollars building
the B-1 fleet and 45 billion dollars on the B-2s. The B-52 is so
old and has undergone so many changes that the Air Force has no
estimate of its total cost.

<HEADLINE> Six Local Journalists Released in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Lusaka High Court Friday
released all the six reporters of the Post newspaper and ordered
the government to compensate them for wrongful detention.
</P>
<P>
But Principal State Advocate, Donald Kasote, indicated that the
 reporters, who allegedly revealed state secrets, could be
re-arrested at a later stage as investigations could be going on.
</P>
<P>
He, however, assured the court that the reporters would not be
re- arrested immediately.
</P>
<P>
Defense Counsel, Sakiwba Sikota, expressed fears that the
reporters could be re-arrested because the state had not clearly
stated whether or not they had withdrawn a case against them.
</P>
<P>
Judge Elliot Chulu ordered that the reporters should be set
free and expressed dissatisfaction with the manner the state
detained the reporters and failed to bring them to court on
Thursday when the matter came up for hearing.
</P>
<P>
The police made the arrests following directives from the
Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly, Simon Mwila, to Defense
Minister Chitalu Sampa on Tuesday to take appropriate action
against their newspaper for its front- page story carried on
Tuesday --Angola worries Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that Zambia is in no position to withstand a
military attack from Angola, in the story there are some details
on the country's military force.

WASHINGTON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Navy said Friday that
it had punished 23 sailors bound for the Gulf who refused
compulsory anthrax shots which will protect them against the
deadly biological agent.
</P>

believe it has not been thoroughly tested and could damage their
health.

were demoted by one rank, given 45 days extra duty, restricted to
the vessel for 45 days and ordered to pay fines equal to one

<HEADLINE> Three Nordic Countries Cut Aid to Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Three Nordic countries have
reduced their aid to Kenya by two-thirds in the past five years,
their envoys said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ambassadors from Sweden, Finland and Norway said that the
multi-million- shilling development aid package to Kenya had been
seriously downsized.
</P>
<P>
The three envoys said that the donor community in their home
countries will meet with Kenya government officials next month to
review progress made on certain conditions before the resumption
of aid.
</P>
<P>
The ambassadors did not reveal whether or not their governments
were satisfied with the progress that Kenyan government had made
on some controversial issues.
</P>
<P>
The envoys did not give the exact figures of how much aid Kenya
used to get from their countries before the decline.
</P>
<P>
Swedish Ambassador to Kenya, Inga Bjork Klevby, said his
country had sharply reduced aid to Kenya, adding that Kenya
currently receives a mere one-third of the amount five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Klevby also said that Sweden welcomed the 16-year plan to
eliminate poverty unveiled by Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Norwegian Ambassador Per Haugestad claimed that some of the
economic issues in Kenya could be tackled by the Kenyan government
in co-operation with donors and friendly countries.

<HEADLINE> 500,000 People in Central Kenya Need Famine Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 12 (Xinhua) -- About half a million people in
Kenya's Central Province require famine relief during the current
drought period, according to a report from the Ministry of
Agriculture available here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that 13 percent of the province's population
needs 332, 494 bags (90 kg per bag) of maize and 117,100 bags of
beans.
</P>
<P>
The provincial crops official E.G. Waithaka said in the
February Crop and Food Situation Report that the only maize
available in the local market is from Rift Valley and Western
provinces. Other food selling at the market are only bananas and
sweet potatoes.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that even in the best of seasons, the province
produces 49 percent of its maize needed by the province's
population with the rest imported from other provinces.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that Kirinyaga District tops the list of
areas in urgent need of relief supplies with Maragwa District
ranking the second.
</P>
<P>
Owing to the failure of the short rains between October and
November last year, most of the crops in the province had become
severely water- stressed, the report said, adding that maize from
the highland areas was harvested green.
</P>
<P>
Beans, Irish potatoes, bananas and cotton were also affected.
For this reason, the yields slumped to 0.2 bags per hectare for
beans and 25 bags per hectare for Irish potatoes.
</P>
<P>
The repof4Efurther noted that the last two months had been very
hot and dry with an average of only four or three wet days in
those districts in January.
</P>
<P>
The official said to enable farmers in Central Province recover
from the effects of drought, 493 tons of maize seeds and 668 tons
of bean seeds are urgently needed in the long rains period
beginning this month.
</P>
<P>
Kajiado District agricultural official Geoffrey Kituyi reported
in mid- February that the majority of farmers in his district had
no food reserves and seeds for planting during the long rains,
because the grain stored earlier was destroyed by the larger
grain borer due to the poor pesticides used.
