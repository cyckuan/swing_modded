<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of the members of
the World Trade Organization (WTO) met here Wednesday in a new
attempt to choose their new leader but failed to reach consensus
on who will lead the organization into the new century.
</P>
<P>
During the three-hour closed-door meeting of the ruling General
Council, WTO members from the Association of South East Asian
Nations (ASEAN) said that, according to the WTO rules, the basic
responsibility of the chairman of the general council is to
facilitate consensus but has no right to eliminate any candidate.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN countries reaffirmed their support for Thailand's
candidate, Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi, who is
running for the WTO top job against former New Zealand Premier
Michael Moore.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the General Council Ali Mchumo, who claimed that
Supachai was out of the race in early May, admitted on Wednesday
that consensus should be built on the two remaining candidates.
But he still insisted that the 134 members of the WTO establish
consensus over his proposal for Moore to be the new
director-general.
</P>
<P>
Former WTO Director-General Renato Ruggiero of Italy retired on
April 30 when his four-year term of office expired, leaving a

<HEADLINE> U.S. Bars Retirements From Air Force amid Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Wednesday
announced a ban on retirements from the Air Force to ensure enough
forces are available for the air campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a regular briefing, Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon
said the ban would apply to some 120,000 Air Force personnel,
including pilots, navigators, air traffic controllers and others,
and would remain in effect as long as reservists were being called
up for the conflict.
</P>
<P>
"Secretary of the Air Force Whitt Peters has signed plans to
implement the Stop Loss procedure for members of the active duty
Air Force and Air Force Reserves," Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
That would mean that people will not be able to leave the Air
Force, retire from the Air Force while the "Stop Loss" order is in
effect.
</P>
<P>
The order, which will take effect June 15th, will apply to
about 40 percent of the skill specialties in the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
"And as long as the presidential reserve call-up is in effect,
these people will not be able to retire from the Air Force," Bacon
added. "This will apply both to the active duty and the reserves."
</P>
<P>
"Practically it would be difficult for anybody to announce
today that he or she wanted to retire and get the retirement
process complete by June 15th," Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that more than 6,000 airmen have requested
and received permission to separate from the Air Force between now
and the end of December.
</P>
<P>
"They will be frozen in the Air Force and will not be able to
go forward with their plans to separate from the Air Force unless,
of course, they apply for and receive a waiver prior to June
15th," Bacon said.

<HEADLINE> Abubakar Pledges Military Retreat to Backs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's out-going military ruler,
Gen. abdulsalami Abubakar Wednesday promised that the army will
retreat to the backs after the new president assumes power three
days later.
</P>
<P>
He made the pledge while presiding over the valedictory session
of the Provisional Ruling Council in Abuja.
</P>
<P>
The council was the highest policy-making body under the
military's rule, which is to be replaced by the the National
Assembly after Abubakar hands over his power to President-elect
Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo on May 29.
</P>
<P>
The general urged his colleagues in the army, on the occasion
to concentrate on their professional duties.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, attended also by the out-going 36 state
military administrators and the president-in-waiting, Obasanjo,
Abubakar described the military profession as an honorable one,
which demanded a lot of sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
We must ensure stability by maintaining our professional
integrity, Abubakar said, adding that constitutional role of the
military was mainly to protect the territorial integrity of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The military has ruled Nigeria for almost 30 of its 39 years of
 independence.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar said members of the armed forces must therefore perform
their role with all sense of loyalty and dedication as they go
back to the backs, adding it had been proved that the military
suffered most during military regimes.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that no military adventurer could take over the
 government without the connivance of the civil populace.
</P>
<P>
To stem such a situation, the Nigerian leader called on
Nigerians not to provide the opportunity for anyone or groups to
truncate the democratic process which had cost so much.
</P>
<P>
Highlight of the occasion was the decoration of three state
administrators with their new ranks, among them, Col. Mohammed
Marwa of Lagos state, who was elevated to brigadier general.

<HEADLINE> Govt to Make Ugandan Economy Self-Sustainable: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- President Yoweri Museveni has
clarified Ugandan social and economic recovery programs as
transforming the national economy from a neocolonial type to a
self- sustainable and integrated one.
</P>
<P>
He said this Wednesday when opening a Ministers' and Permanent
Secretaries' retreat in Jinja, 80 kms east of the capital city
Kampala.
</P>
<P>
The president identified for the ministers and permanent
secretaries some of the shortcomings in the implementation of
government programs and in creating conditions for the social
economic recovery of the country, a press release from the
President's Office said.
</P>
<P>
The crucial area of intervention in order to create capacity
for increased incomes for the people is the homestead, he
explained. In this regard, the livestock restocking in northern
Uganda is one way of achieving this goal in that region.
</P>
<P>
The government, he noted, needs to assist farmers in the north
with appropriate agricultural implements such as oxen and ploughs
in order to improve and sustain their agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
He warned against continued frustration of investors and called
upon all relevant organs of government to support programs geared
at export promotion in order to expand the country's export
capacity and increase its foreign exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
Museveni also talked about the corruption, environmental
degradation, law and order as well as the relationship between the
executive and the legislature.
</P>
<P>
The retreat, whose theme is The Promotion and Strengthening of
Teamwork for Good Governance and Sustainable Development, is
organized by the Ministry of Public Service and will last for four
days.

LUANDA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- British Ambassador to Angola
Caroline Helmes Wednesday reiterated that her government is to
tighten its sanctions on the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA), in accordance with the U.N.
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Helmes emphasized that Britain will, together with other U.N.
members, try to make the U.N. sanctions on UNITA more effective,
thus forcing UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi to giver up his war
policy.
</P>
<P>
"Britain supports U.N. stand on the Angola issue and feel sad
over the renewed war in Angola," the ambassador said, adding that
Savimbi should be held responsible for the civil war in the
country, as he has violated the Lusaka Peace Protocol signed in
1994.
</P>
<P>
She said she wishes Angola would achieve peace in the country,
as it is very important to the development in southern Africa,
where Britain has extensive political, diplomatic and economic
interests.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government, in a recent diplomatic offensive, has
demanded the international community strictly observe the U.N.
resolutions on Angola, which include the sanctions on UNITA's
import of oil and arms, and the ban on UNITA leaders trips abroad,
the closure of UNITA offices overseas and its export of diamond.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government has been accusing some European and
African countries, including British companies, of continuing
their secret support to the UNITA, for which the U.N. Security
Council has decided this month to investigate.

<HEADLINE> Angola's Diamond-Producing Province in Critical </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- An Angolan general has said the
situation in Lunda-Norte Province, a diamond-producing area in the
northeast, is critical following the beefing up of military
operations by the opposition National Union for th Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Sa Miranda, commander of the eastern military command area, was
quoted by a Angola News Agency report Wednesday as saying in Nzaji
in eastern Angola that UNITA forces had cut road links between
Dundo, an interim seat of the provincial government, and other
cities by destroying major bridges, while launching attacks at
major mines.
</P>
<P>
The moves were aimed at paralyzing diamond production in the
province, preventing the free movement of personnel and goods and
occupying some areas of strategic importance, said the general.
</P>
<P>
He added that about 800 UNITA soldiers are concentrating at
Cassai river valley, ready to attack Cambulo City, about 60
kilometers to the southeast of Dundo.
</P>
<P>
Despite the "worrying" situation in the province close to the
Democratic Republic of Congo, the armed forces and national police
have disrupted the strategic arrangement of the UNITA forces
through a series of counter attacks, so that the situation there
is still under the government control, he said.
</P>
<P>
Angola is one of major diamond-producing countries in Africa,
with an output of over two million carats in 1998, most of which
came from the Lunda-norte Province.
</P>
<P>
Since the civil war re-erupted in Angola, both the government
and the UNITA are fighting for the control of the rare resources.

forward in the formulation of the country's new constitution, the
Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said NCA was opposed to the presidential commission because
the majority of the commissioners were paid-up members of the
ruling Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front
(ZANU-PF).
</P>
<P>
The commission is expected to consult all Zimbabweans on
provisions of the new constitution which should be drafted by
November.
</P>
<P>
Tsvangirai said NCA was convinced the 398-member government
constitutional commission, sworn into office by President Robert
Mugabe last Friday, did not represent all Zimbabweans.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of talks of drafting a new constitution,
the assembly and the government had had differences, and the
government decided to go on with the process without the
assembly's contribution.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is using the British-authored Lancaster House
constitution of 1979 which most people feel was out-dated and did
not represent the interests of Zimbabweans.

ATHENS, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Greece reiterated Wednesday that it
was against the use of NATO ground forces in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas made the statement
at a press briefing. He stressed that Greece also did not intend
to receive refugees from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Greece was the only country which had provided effective
humanitarian aid to the war-torn Serbian province, he added.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the decision by NATO to increase the number of
its troops stationed on Kosovo's borders to nearly 50,000, Reppas
said that no decisions had yet been taken about the size of the
Greek contingent to participate in any eventual peacekeeping force
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Greece's Defense Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos also said
Wednesday that NATO's such decision provided no guarantee of a
solution to the Kosovo crisis. The rate at which the peacekeeping
force was assembled should be on a par with efforts for a

CAIRO, May 26 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese banking official has said
China will continue to strengthen the economic and trade
cooperation with African countries in extensive areas based on the
principle of mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the 1999 Annual Meetings of Board of Governors
of African Development Bank Group, Xiao Gang, vice-president of
the People's Bank of China, hopes to take a healthy, stable and
dynamic Sino-African relationship into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Xiao, who heads the Chinese delegation to the meetings held in
Cairo on May 25-27, called on African countries to place
importance on the development of human resources and the creation
of a favorable environment for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
He urged the international community, particularly the
developed countries, to help African countries promote stability
and develop the economy.
</P>
<P>
They should also take concrete measures to reduce the debt
burden of highly indebted poor countries and narrow the gap
between Africa and other continents in economic development, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese official pledged continued support to the Bank
Group's efforts in strengthening internal control and project
management.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Russia Develops New Navy Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Russia announced Wednesday that it
has developed a new anti-ship missile that will "revolutionize the
nature of a naval battle," the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The new missile, ZM-54E1, developed by the Novator
Experimental Design Bureau in Yekaterinburg, is 6.2 meters long,
the same as the length of the standard torpedo tubes used by
Western navies, Tass said, quoting Deputy General Designer
Vyacheslav Gorbarenko.
</P>
<P>
"The testing of the new weapon is practically over and the
missile can be delivered to a foreign client within a year after a
corresponding contract is signed," Gorbarenko said.
</P>
<P>
The ZM-54E1 was designed according to the double-stage cruise
scheme, with the first solid-fuel stage ensuring the missile's
blast-off from a universal vertical launcher of a surface craft or
from a submarine torpedo tube with a diameter of 0.533 meters,
Tass said.
</P>
<P>
The second stage sustainer engine goes into action after the
first stage drops off when the missile reaches the prescribed
altitude. This is the time when the missile's wing and tail
assembly unfolds.
</P>
<P>
The altitude of the missiles flight goes down to 10-15 meters
above the sea surface and the missile heads towards the target in
accordance with the target designations, fed before the start into
the memory of its on-board guidance system.
</P>
<P>
The targeting on the cruise sector of the missile is achieved
by an inertia navigation system and the end sector of the
missile's flight with the homing head active proceeds only five
meters above the water surface.
</P>
<P>
The missile, with a launch weight of 1,570 kilograms, has a
range of 300 kilometers and a powerful 450-kilogram warhead, which
can blow up very large surface craft, Tass said.
</P>
<P>
"Delivery of new Russian missiles will be effected together
with the entire missile set, which includes ZM-54E1 missiles, fire-
control system, launcher, ground servicing system, and trainer,"
Gorbarenko said.

PARIS, May 26 (Xinhua) -- France Wednesday called on Israel to
suspend building settlements in Abu Ghneim and Ras-al-Amud in east
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"We learned with concern the launching of the projects of
construction of these new Israeli settlements in Ras-al-Amud and
on the hill of Abu Ghneim. We renew our opposition to the
colonization of the occupied territories, notably in Jerusalem,"
said French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said that France calls for the suspension of
these new projects, which have been criticized many times by the
international community.
</P>
<P>
"What appears important to us today is to create an atmosphere
proper for the re-launching of the peace process which is much
expected," she said.
</P>
<P>
Israel began building the new Har Homa settlement on the hill
of Abu Ghneim on the eve of its general elections earlier this

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Government Urged to Reduce Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government must
pursue policies designed to achieve price stability and rapid
economic growth to reduce poverty, the Poverty Reduction Forum
(PRF) has said.
</P>
<P>
In its Human Development Report released here Wednesday, the
forum said weak economic growth, rising unemployment and a skewed
pattern of income and wealth distribution had resulted in the
increase in poverty, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The report said economic growth had drastically slowed down
after the introduction of the Economic Structural Adjustment
Program in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The program was aimed to establish an environment conducive to
sustainable economic growth and development.
</P>
<P>
"Most macro-economic targets were missed, inflation
accelerated, unemployment and poverty increased," the report said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that low job creation in the formal sector had
resulted in school leavers being pushed into the informal sector
which had low technology and short life span.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that since 1990 the formal sector had created
less than 25,000 new jobs which could not satisfy the 300,000
school leavers who searched for jobs annually.
</P>
<P>
The report recommended good governance, transparency and
accountability to eliminate corruption and reallocate public
spending to activities beneficial to the poor.

LONDON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Queen Elizabeth II opened the
National Assembly of Wales on Wednesday, saying it showed "a new
and significant direction in the way Wales is governed."
</P>
<P>
The Queen was joined by the Duke of Edinburgh and the Prince of
Wales for the historic royal opening of the new assembly in
Cardiff, the capital of Wales.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly received its royal opening during what
was described as a "low key" and "informal" ceremony at its
temporary home in Crickhowell House.
</P>
<P>
The assembly's First Secretary Alun Michael Michael said at the
ceremony that it was "a time of change and it is also a time of
hope."
</P>
<P>
There was a "profound sense of history on these proceedings",
he continued.
</P>
<P>
The real test of the assembly would be whether it would improve
the quality of life of the people of Wales, he said.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the opposition Dafydd Wigley echoed that the
assembly's first task would be to "work for the benefit of all the
people of Wales".
</P>
<P>
"The new national power house will create new confidence and
add new dignity to Wales," he said.

BANGKOK, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast Asian

Wednesday to promote their cooperation, said a report issued by
the on-going ASEAN-EU Joint Cooperation Committee (JCC) meeting.
</P>
<P>
Heads of delegations of both groupings signed the "New Dynamics

The plan, reviewed by a JCC sub-committee Tuesday, will serve
as a blueprint for both regions for joint work in fields of civil
aviation, maritime cooperation, trade facilitation, transnational
crimes, forestry and business cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN-EU JCC meeting was resumed after a nearly two-year
break due to a diplomatic dispute over the presence of Myanmar,
which the EU claims is poor in human rights records.
</P>
<P>
However, after long negotiations, Myanmar has now been allowed
to attend the JCC meeting along with other new members of the
ASEAN, namely Laos and Cambodia, on the grounds that none of their
representatives speaks at the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Financial Institutions Urged to Assist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has called on
 financial institutions in the country to assist small scale
business enterprises to have access to credit and other financial
services in order to promote economic development.
</P>
<P>
James Mtonga, permanent secretary in the Ministry of Finance
and Economic Development, said here Wednesday that the small scale
sector had great potential to contribute significantly toward
sustainable growth and poverty reduction in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Mtonga, however, noted that the amount of capital available in
developing countries was not adequate to sustain development. He
welcomed the efforts by the Zambia Union of Savings and Credit
Association Trust (ZUSCT) to revive the credit unions network in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening a ZUSCT workshop here, Mtonga said the
government was committed to maintaining a sound and stable
financial sector in order to achieve a higher rate of growth
through increased savings and investment.
</P>
<P>
The government would also ensure that a sound banking system
that promotes development and growth of financial intermediation
was maintained in addition to protecting depositors, he said.
</P>
<P>
He further noted that without a stable financial system there
would be a breakdown in the nation's payment system which was
largely administered by banks and credit unions.
</P>
<P>
He said the number of banks in Zambia had increased from 12 to
over 20 as a result of liberalization and sound economic policies
the government had put in place since 1991.
</P>
<P>
Zambia would need efficient financial intermediation in order
to foster high export-led growth and create employment
opportunities in the private sector, he added.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Lends 250 Million Dollars to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved on
Wednesday a total of 250 million U.S. dollars in loans and credits
to help China increase the incomes of poor farmers and
agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
The bank's executive board approved a 80-million-dollar loan
and a 20-million-dollar credit for the Guanzhong Irrigation
Improvement Project and a 100-million-dollar loan and a
50-million-dollar credit for the Second Loess Plateau Watershed
Rehabilitation Project.
</P>
<P>
The Guanzhong Irrigation Improvement Project aims to increase
grain production in the nine Irrigation District areas, increase
the incomes of farmers, and strengthen irrigation management in
the Guanzhong Plain in the Wei River Valley of Shanxi Province,
the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the Second Loess Plateau Watershed
Rehabilitation Project is to help achieve sustainable development
by increasing agricultural production and incomes, and improving
ecological conditions in tributary watersheds of the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, moderately sloped land will be converted to
high-yielding terraced cropland, and the steeper slopes will be
planted to a range of trees, shrubs and grasses. Sediment control
structures will reduce erosion from the gullies and create
valuable farmland.
</P>
<P>
The primary beneficiaries of the project are poor people living
in remote villages in the area. Of the 37 counties in the project,
19 are classified by the government as amongst the poorest in
China.
</P>
<P>
The two loans would be at the bank's interest rate for
LIBOR-based U.S. dollar single-currency loans, with a maturity of
20 years, including a five-year grace period. The two credits,
provided by the International Development Association (IDA), the
bank's concessionary lending arm, would be on standard IDA terms
with 35 years' maturity.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American Development
Bank (IDB) announced on Wednesday the approval of a loan amounting
to 105 million U.S. dollars to Trinidad and Tobago to help reform
and expand secondary education.
</P>
<P>
The resources will enable the Ministry of Education to
undertake a program designed to create a base of skills that are
essential to sustaining the country's economic growth in the next
century by enhancing the population's technical and managerial
capacity, the Washington-based bank said.
</P>
<P>
Among the investments will be the introduction of a more modern
curriculum and new instructional resources, establishment of a
magnet school program to promote excellence and innovation,
professional development of teachers and other staff, the
rehabilitation and upgrading of school infrastructure, and
institutional strengthening of the Ministry of Education, the bank
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
A goal a of the project is to provide greater access, quality
and coverage of the secondary education system for low-income
groups, and advance toward achieving universal secondary coverage
from its current rate of 69 percent.
</P>
<P>
Components of the program include the installation of computer
laboratories in all 100 existing secondary schools and the
construction of 20 new schools.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the program is 150 million dollars. The IDB
loan is for a 25-year term, with a seven-year grace period, at the
variable interest rate, now 6.98 percent. Local counterpart funds
total 45 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Rejects Plan for More Military Base Closings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate Wednesday
rejected the Bill Clinton administration's request to close more
military bases as a cost-saving measure.
</P>
<P>
The 60-to-40 Senate vote rejected a move by Republican Senator
John McCain and Democratic Senator Carl Levin to authorize a new
round of base closings in 2001.
</P>
<P>
This was the third year in a row Congress has blocked the plan.
</P>
<P>
The administration has argued that many of the bases are relics
of the Cold War, and shutting them down could free up funds that
could be used to modernize weapons and to meet other pressing
Pentagon needs.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen contends that closing
antiquated bases -- many of them Cold War relics -- could save the
Pentagon nearly four billion U.S. dollars a year that would be
better spent on aircraft carriers, jet fighters and other crucial
hardware.
</P>
<P>
However, Congress has always been reluctant to close bases.
</P>
<P>
The government's proposal for two new rounds of base closings
-- one in 2001 and another in 2005 -- was rejected earlier this
month by the Armed Services panel.
</P>
<P>
The debate occurred as the Senate worked on a
288.8-billion-U.S.-dollar defense spending bill for the fiscal
year that begins next October 1.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Voices "Deep Concern" at Humanitarian  Situation in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Wednesday voiced "deep concern" at the humanitarian situation in
Angola, saying that it is the responsibility of the Angolan
Government and the rebel National Union for Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) to cooperate with the United Nations in rendering
humanitarian assistance to all the people in need.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press here, the president of the
15-nation body, Denis Dangue Rewaka of Gabon, said, "Members of
the Council reiterated their deep concern at the continuing
deterioration of the humanitarian situation in Angola and at the
ever increasing number of internally displaced persons that has
now reached the number of 1.6 million."
</P>
<P>
"They expressed particular concern over the dramatic reduction
of the operational space available to humanitarian agencies
throughout Angola, as a consequence of which large parts of the
territory of Angola remain unaccessible for the humanitarian
community and large parts of the population in need are not
reached," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Members of the Council emphasized once again the
responsibility of the Government of Angola and UNITA to cooperate
with U.N. and other organizations in their humanitarian assistance
to all those in need and to guarantee unconditionally the security
and freedom of movement of humanitarian personnel," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
"In this regard, members of the Council reaffirmed
international convention on the treatment of civilians in times of
war and underlined the importance of the principles of neutrality
and impartiality in th delivery of humanitarian assistance
throughout the territory," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Members of the Council expressed outrage at recent attacks by
UNITA on civilian population, humanitarian relief workers and
civilians aircraft, provoking a number of deaths and injuries and
the destruction of property and jeopardizing humanitarian
deliveries," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Security Council "reiterate their call for the
immediate release of the 3 crew members of the downed Antonov-26
by UNITA," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after the Security Council met in a
closed-door session to be briefed by the U.N. Secretariat on the
latest humanitarian situation in the southwest African country.
</P>
<P>
"Members of the Council affirmed that the obligation to
facilitate humanitarian assistance applies equally to all parties
to a conflict and underlined that it is vital for the humanitarian
community to be allowed access for assessment missions and to
develop mechanisms for the delivery of humanitarian assistance to
all populations in need throughout the territory," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council on Wednesday last week strongly condemned
a "criminal act" by UNITA in shooting down a Russian Antonov-26
commercial aircraft on May 12 and "taking hostage" its Russian
crew.
</P>
<P>
Reports from northern Angola said the aircraft, brought down by
a missile, carried three Russian crew and two Angolans.
</P>
<P>
A 1994 peace accord between the Angolan Government and UNITA,
which the United Nations had been helping to implement, fell apart
during the past year and full-scale civil war resumed in many
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council is still waiting for the outcomes of the
investigations into the downing of two U.N.-chartered cargo planes
in Angola on December 26, 1998 and on January 2, 1999, in which 23
people were killed.

<HEADLINE> Greece Seeks Pause in NATO Bombing Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou Wednesday called for a pause in NATO bombing of
Yugoslavia to encourage Yugoslavia to respond positively to tough
demands for settlement of the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, Papandreou reaffirmed the Greek proposal that there
should be a pause in NATO's bombing to give some stimulus to the
diplomatic efforts.
</P>
<P>
"We feel that the proposal, this idea of the bombing pause, can
be one which might be necessary, might be able to be used at some
point which will further spur on diplomatic efforts and
particularly help a U.N. resolution in the Security Council," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Greece, being in the region and feeling the direct effects of
what's going in the region, has put great emphasis in working on
the diplomatic front and being helpful," Papandreou said.
</P>
<P>
However, speaking at a joint press conference with Albright,
Papandreou also said, "I want to be very clear on this, is that
obviously the five positions stand and they must be met with and
agreed upon."
</P>
<P>
Albright appeared to rule the idea of a pause out, reiterating
that the bombing would be halted only if Yugoslavia accepted
NATO's demands.
</P>
<P>
She also praised Greece as playing an important role in Kosovo,
even though it was not participating in the attacks on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Of the 19 NATO nations, Greece probably is the most skeptical
that all-out bombing will bring Belgrade to bow before NATO.

<HEADLINE> S. Africans Abroad Go to Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 26 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's second
democratic election got underway Wednesday as South Africans
working and studying abroad cast special votes at the country's
foreign missions.
</P>
<P>
However, in terms of electoral regulations, South African
holiday makers, tourists and cricket fans in Europe for the
Cricket World Cup were excluded from casting their ballots.
</P>
<P>
Back home, security personnel on election duty on June 2,
Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) officials, and voters who
will be abroad on the voting day, were also able to cast their
ballots.
</P>
<P>
The polling station at the High Commission in the Australian
capital Canberra was the first to open but officials said only 16
people -- five of them high commission staff -- had voted by 8
p.m. local time, an hour before polling closed, South African
Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The embassy in Beijing, home to a permanent community of only
40 South Africans, saw around a dozen voters by late afternoon,
according to first secretary Izak Human.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 South Africans -- many of them cricket fans on
their way to the World Cup match between South Africa and Kenya in
Amsterdam -- had voted at the embassy in The Hague in The
Netherlands by noon.
</P>
<P>
In London, a small but steady trickle of voters passed through
the halls of South Africa House to cast their ballots, according
to SAPA.
</P>
<P>
The scene was in stark contrast to five years ago when election
 officials had their hands full coping with a queue of eager, many
first- time, voters.
</P>
<P>
Once the polling stations closed at 9 p.m., the ballot boxes
would be emptied and the votes placed into special bags and sealed
before being transported back to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
All foreign votes will be counted at a polling station in
central Pretoria, IEC spokeswoman Lydia Young said.
</P>
<P>
Polling stations at the South African embassy in Washington and
the consulate in New York reported a slow start but expected the
pace to pick up around lunch time.
</P>
<P>
The voting at home and abroad was rather smooth with only small
hitches.
</P>
<P>
In Gauteng Province, the presiding officer at the Winchester
Ridge Primary School south of Johannesburg, Liam Clarke, was
hijacked while unloading ballot papers at the school when a gunman
ordered him to hand over his vehicle's keys, SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
Police managed to recover the IEC vehicle, including national
and provincial ballot papers and security stamps, although
declaration certificates, which looked like cheques, were not
recovered.
</P>
<P>
IEC officials said they believed the incident was not
politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
Another IEC vehicle was stolen in the Johannesburg South Area
Wednesday, while two rented vehicles were hijacked on the West
Rand Tuesday. One council vehicle used for electoral purposes was
stolen last week.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's special voting day was specifically for security
force members, but instead IEC officials allowed people like
journalists and pensioners, who were supposed to make arrangements
to vote next week, to cast their votes Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Diplomat Refutes U.S. Espionage Allegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- A Senior Chinese Diplomat
refuted here Wednesday the U.S. allegation that China has "stolen"
nuclear secrets from the United States.
</P>
<P>
"As Chinese leaders and spokesman of the Chinese government
have repeatedly said, China has never stolen any nuclear secrets
from the United States, " said Liu Xiaoming, Minister of the
Chinese Embassy in the United States, in a CNN interview.
</P>
<P>
Liu said the Cox Report is "full of unproven allegations and
vague languages such as maybe and possibly, there is no solid
evidence to support those allegations".
</P>
<P>
A U.S. House Committee headed by Republican Representative
Christopher Cox issued an 872-page report Tuesday, alleging that
China got secret information on seven nuclear warheads and the
neutron bomb through "espionage" at U.S. nuclear weapons
laboratories.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Cox report, Liu said some politicians here try
to "play politics and make China as victim of their partisan
politics".
</P>
<P>
Liu said the Cox report tries to regard China as a "threat" to
the United States, but China will not threaten the United States.
</P>
<P>
"China is the least country among the major nuclear powers
which can pose a threat to the United States as China is the only
country which has undertaken the obligation not to use nuclear
weapons first," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Liu said he was not concerned at all over the investigations
being conducted by several U.S. Congress committees since China
has done nothing wrong, what he was concerned about is the
U.S.-China relations.
</P>
<P>
"If you have not done anything wrong, you do not fear that a
ghost will knock at your door at midnight," Liu said, citing an
old Chinese saying.
</P>
<P>
"I am concerned that some people will use the report to stir up
anti-China sentiment to derail the relationship and undo the
progress made by our two countries in the past years," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I am also concerned that a hostile atmosphere might be
created for the Chinese Americans working here and for the
Chinese students and scholars studying here. They have done a
great deal to contribute to the progress of American society,"
he added.

<HEADLINE> S. African Soldiers Allowed to Joint Trade Unions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Members of the South African
National Defense Force (SANDF) will from Wednesday be legally
allowed to join labor unions following a Constitutional Court
ruling.
</P>
<P>
The Constitutional Court Wednesday confirmed a Pretoria High
Court judgment last year that it was unconstitutional to prohibit
members of the SANDF to join trade unions.
</P>
<P>
The judgment ended an almost five-year battle by the South
African National Defense Union (SANDU) to have their union
declared legal.
</P>
<P>
The union was established in 1994 but was illegal in terms of
the Defense Act which prohibited members from joining trade unions
or participating in protest action.
</P>
<P>
Pretoria High Court judge WJ Hartzenbeg ruled last November
that this section of the Defense Act, prohibiting members from
joining trade unions was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
Constitutional Court judge Kate O'Regan delivered the judgment
on behalf of the Constitutional Court judges, saying the court
decided that prohibiting participation in acts of public protests
violated the right to freedom of expression of defense force
members.
</P>
<P>
This amounted to a grave infringement on the fundamental rights
of soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The court placed a three-month delay on the order to allow the
SANDF to get its house in order.
</P>
<P>
But, it added a provision that if the delayed order caused any
party substantial prejudice, such party may approach the court
again.
</P>
<P>
The ruling, however, does not change the fact that uniformed
members would not be allowed to strike. The court said in its
judgment the union accepted that strike action was inappropriate
in the military context but this should not prevent members from
joining trade unions.
</P>
<P>
SANDU national secretary Cor van Niekerk said Wednesday's
Constitutional Court ruling could have serious repercussions for
the South African National Defense Force's transformation and
rationalization policies.
</P>
<P>
He said the union warned the SANDF some time ago to allow the
union to participate in decisions which could affect soldiers.
</P>
<P>
"We warned them we expected the union to be legalized. These
unilateral decisions taken by the SANDF will now be challenged."
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's decision made South Africa only one of nine
countries in the world to declare a defense force union legal.
</P>
<P>
Van Niekerk said South Africa was also the only country on the
African continent to afford its soldiers these rights.
</P>
<P>
The union currently represents between 15,000 and 17,000
members.
</P>
<P>
Van Niekerk said these members joined while it was still
illegal for them to join.
</P>
<P>
"We expect that we could have between 40,000 and 50,000 members
within three months. The potential is 100,000 members," he said.
</P>
<P>
SANDF spokesman Colonel John Rolt said the defense force took
note of the judgment and was studying it. He could therefore not
comment further, SAPA said.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Nepal's New Prime Minister K.P. Bhattarai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Krishna Prasad Bhattarai Thursday
fulfilled his long-cherished dream of returning to the premiership
of Nepal at last, but only eight years later.
</P>
<P>
On April 19, 1990, he was named by King Birendra to head an
interim government to draft a new constitution and hold general
elections.
</P>
<P>
The constitution provides for a constitutional monarchy in
Nepal. In the May 1991 general elections, the Nepali Congress, of
which Bhattarai was acting president, secured a majority of seats
but Bhattarai lost at the height of his popularity and stepped
down that month.
</P>
<P>
He lost again in the by-election to the House of
Representatives in February 1994.
</P>
<P>
However, he won by a wide margin in the elections held on May
17. "God goaded the voters to catch me while I'm still active," he
said when asked who he would like to thank for the victory. Months
before the elections, he had been offered the premiership by party
President and Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala.
</P>
<P>
Bhattarai was born on December 22, 1924, in Benaras, India. He
was one of the commanders during the Nepalese revolution against
the 104-year-old autocratic Rana regime in November 1950.
</P>
<P>
He was unanimously elected speaker of the first elected
parliament in Nepal in 1959-60. He was imprisoned in December 1960
when King Mahendra, King Birendra's father, staged a royal coup
and dissolved the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Bhattarai was incarcerated for about 14 years during the king's
"one-man rule" which lasted for 30 years until a pro-democracy
movement in early 1990, in which Bhattarai was a chief leader,
reinstated the multi-party parliamentary system in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Bhattarai is a bachelor. "They took me to jail when I was
young, and (I) was released when I became old -- perhaps too old
for young and energetic women," he once teased.
</P>
<P>
Reading sacred verses from Hindu scripture Geeta has been a
part of Bhattarai's routine for years. A two-mile walk and yoga
are his two other morning occupations.
</P>
<P>
To Bhattarai, accepting the post of prime minister is to take a
divine order to embark on a mission. But to illiterate Nepalese,
this is incomprehensible.
</P>
<P>
"That is why I want to raise the literacy rate to 90 percent
from the present level of 40 percent," he said.

<HEADLINE> Barak: Shas Should be Included in Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 27 (Xinhua)-- Israel's religious party Shas
should be asked to join and play its role in the incoming
coalition government, Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a gathering in Israel's northern town of Qir
Shemona, Barak said the Shas is an important political party and
there is no reason why it should not be allowed to join the
coalition government, according to Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Barak said Shas has contributed a lot to the Israeli society
and the door is open for it to join the coalition.
</P>
<P>
But One Israel's sister party Meretz still refuses to sit
in the coalition government together with Shas.
</P>
<P>
Meretz made this stand clear Thursday afternoon at Herzliya
where One Israel's negotiating team started its second round of
coalition talks with the political parties which won Knesset
(parliament) seats.
</P>
<P>
Meretz will not sit in the government with the right-wing
party such as Shas whose leader was sentenced to a four-year
imprisonment for fraud and taking bribery, Meretz was reportedly
told One Israel at the talks.
</P>
<P>
Barak expressed his hope that Meretz will change its attitude
toward Shas and work with it in the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Shas won 17 Knesset seats in the May 17 elections, becoming the
third largest party in the Knesset just behind One Israel and
Likud. Meretz got 10 seats
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Barak reiterated his pledge to pull out Israel
Defense Force (IDF) soldiers from the security zone in south
Lebanon within one year.
</P>
<P>
He said this will not affect the IDF's morale, but the biggest
issue for his government is to find out effective ways to
guarantee Israel's northern security.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the security zone in 1985 in south Lebanon in a
self-proclaimed purpose of protecting is northern security.
</P>
<P>
Local military groups such as Hezbollah have been waging
military resistance against the IDF since then, causing a
considerable amount of casualties among the IDF officers and
soldiers.

<HEADLINE> China to Speed up Nuclear Power Self-reliance Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- A senior official with China's
Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National
Defense said today that "China hopes that nuclear power technology
transfers from abroad will help speed up the country's nuclear
power self-reliance process."

recalled the 20-year sincere cooperation in the field of nuclear
power industry between China and France, giving high credit to the
fruitful accomplishments achieved by China during the process of
becoming self-reliant in the nuclear power industry, referring to
French nuclear power technology and know-how.
</P>
<P>
The French government also pays great attention to Sino-
France cooperation. French ambassador to China, Pierre Morel, also
attended the seminar, and said the French government is very happy
to see these three French companies participating in the process
of and making contributions to self-reliance for China's nuclear
power industry.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Protecting Legal Rights and Interests of Overseas Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, May 27 (Xinhua) -- To safeguard the legal rights and
interests of overseas-funded enterprises in Tianjin in north China
is the responsibility of the municipal government and is essential
for ensuring that the businesses profit locally.
</P>
<P>
Li Shenglin, mayor of Tianjin, made these remarks at a
symposium on the local investment environment attended by
officials of more than 20 local departments and representatives of
20 large local overseas-funded enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Problems that overseas investors want to resolve focus on
their lack of access to the policy process of local government,
non-reasonable fees charged on some monopolized sectors, and the
year 2000 computer problem, popularly known as the millennium bug
or Y2K.
</P>
<P>
Li Shenglin announced a deadline for resolving some of these
problems.
</P>
<P>
Priority is being given to standardizing fee charges on
enterprises, and reducing fees to the lowest possible level as an
effort toward reducing non-production costs for local overseas-
funded enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin now has more than 12,000 overseas-funded enterprises
involving 24.1 billion U.S. dollars of overseas investment. Some 4,
000 overseas-funded local enterprises are doing well, contributing
more than 40 percent of the local industrial output value and more
than 70 percent of local exports annually.

<HEADLINE> Thai Candidate Stays in the WTO Race: Chuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Thai Commerce Minister Supachai
Panitchpakdi will not withdraw from the deadlocked race for the
directorship of the World Trade Organization (WTO), Thai Prime
Minister Chuan Leekpai said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chuan made the remarks after another meeting of the WTO's
decision-making general council on Wednesday in Geneva failed once
again to solve the impasse between the Thai candidate and his New
Zealand rival, Mike Moore.
</P>
<P>
Chuan said that if the current selection process goes ahead,
Supachai, who is also the government's deputy prime minister, will
stay in.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that if the process is taken back to the
very beginning, Supachai may withdraw.
</P>
<P>
The struggle for the leadership of the 134-member world trade
body has lasted for several months. No consensus can be formed
around either Supachai or Moore.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has blamed the United States for blocking its
candidate, who had been leading in earlier rounds of the selection
process.

<HEADLINE> China to Turn Sci-Tech Research Institutes Into Enterprises (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- China is trying to turn its heavily
state-funded scientific and technological research institutes into
profit-making enterprises, Vice Premier Li Lanqing said here today.
</P>
<P>
"Helping sci-tech research institutes to become independent
enterprises based on science and technology, or research and
development departments affiliated with enterprises, will turn out
to be a major breakthrough in our country's reform of the existing
science and technology system," Li told a two-day forum on the
reform of sci-tech research institutes which ended in Beijing
today.
</P>
<P>
Jointly hosted by the Ministry of Science and the State
Economic and Trade Commission (SETC), the forum drew participants
from 242 sci-tech research institutes affiliated with 10 different
national administrative bureaus under the management of the SETC.
</P>
<P>
The 242 institutes, which will take the lead in introducing
major systematic shifts, can play a significant exemplary role in
the nationwide reform of the current science and technology system,
noted Li, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
"Your separation from your former competent government
departments is also an experiment for the full-scale reform of
social institutions in the near future," said Li.
</P>
<P>
At the turn of the century, Li noted, the industrialization of
science and technology has become a distinct characteristic of
scientific and economic development worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, a country's scientific and technological
power and its ability to turn this power into real productive
forces have become a factor which directly decides the country's
comprehensive national strength and international status, and has
a bearing on sovereignty and security.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, we must step up our efforts to implement our
strategy of reinvigorating China through science and education
with a strong sense of urgency and sense of crisis," he stressed.

<P>
Faced with the current global tide of economic and scientific
development, China has no other option but to prompt its sci-tech
research institutes to become enterprises, said the vice premier.
</P>
<P>
"Our ultimate purpose is not to diminish your research and
development capability, but to enhance it through adopting the new
system," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He also pledged that the state will increase its support for
sci-tech research, especially research on key technologies,
technologies that can be shared by an entire economic sector, and
high technologies of strategic importance.
</P>
<P>
"However, state funds for research programs will no longer be
allocated to you as in the past, and you must fight for it with
your actual strength and win it through opening bidding," said the
vice premier.
</P>
<P>
He urged all research institutes to try to establish, as
quickly as possible, a modern enterprise system with strict
management and good internal incentives once they have become
independent enterprises or part of an existing enterprise.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, you must remember to seek survival and further
development through a constant improvement of your creativity and
scientific initiative, and always take it as your mission to
promote the development of our country's hi-tech sectors," he
suggested.
</P>
<P>
The vice premier also called on all relevant central government
departments and local governments across the country to give all-
out support to the reform of sci-tech research institutes.
</P>
<P>
Today's forum was presided over by Minister of Science Zhu
Lilan.

<HEADLINE> Giraffes Survive Long Journey to Reach Northwest China Zoo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Two young giraffes arrived here
today at the city zoo of this capital of northwest China's Gansu
Province after a long and dangerous journey that lasted three days
and nights.
</P>
<P>
The giraffes, the first for the 40-year-old zoo, are both
around two-and-a-half-years old and over three meters tall, and
they came here from Qinhuangdao, a port city in the northern
province of Hebei some 2,100 kilometers from Lanzhou.
</P>
<P>
"We have long expected to have giraffes in our zoo, but we
failed to do so because of transportation difficulties," said a
manager at the Lanzhou zoo, which also has rare animals including
the giant panda and golden monkeys.
</P>
<P>
A zoo vet explained that because the giraffe is very tall and
has very high blood pressure, it's quite easy for the animal to
die of a broken neck or burst blood vessels during long-distance
transportation. The height of an adult giraffe can reach six
meters.
</P>
<P>
"This time, we took special precautions with the transportation
vehicles, and several of our staff escorting the giraffes got only
two hours of sleep during the journey," said the zoo manager.
</P>
<P>
The Lanzhou zoo has spent more than 600,000 yuan (about 75,000
U.S. dollars) building a special residence for the giraffes, which
are expected to be able to meet visitors before International
Children's Day on June 1.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- A 22-member interim Chittagong Hill
Tracts Regional Council(CHTRC) was formally set up in Bangladesh's
southeastern hill district of Rangamati Thursday in realization of
the 1997 CTH Peace Agreement, the national news agency BSS
reported.
</P>
<P>
The CHT (Chittagong Hill Tracts) Peace Agreement was signed in
December 1997 between the government and the tribal organization,
ending a more-then-two-decade-long insurgency in the CHT.
</P>
<P>
"This is an auspicious journey and the moment historic for the
people of the hill districts as well as the nation," Jyotirrindra
Bodhipriya Larma, who took over as chairman of the CHTRC on May
12.
</P>
<P>
The council's establishment ended an eight-month-long deadlock
in implementing a major provision of the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Larma reiterated his appeal to the government for "quick and
proper" implementation of the pact including withdrawal of army
camps in the 11,655 square kilometer rugged region in line with
the accord, the report said.
</P>
<P>
He urged his former rival, the security forces, to forget the
past and move together for the development of the region.
</P>
<P>
"The tribal people may still have repulsion toward you and you
too may have similar feeling, but let us leave the past behind,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of guests including government leaders, diplomats,
tribal and Bengali representatives and ex-rebels witnessed the
event.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Public Security
disclosed today that police have brought back to China a criminal
suspect, accused of embezzling tens of millions of yuan of public
funds, from the Republic of Ecuador yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The 46-year-old Zhou Changqing, alias as Li Zhiming, was at
one time the general manager of the Mechanics and Electrical
Equipment Company of Shaanxi Province in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
During November and December of 1997, Zhou transferred more
than 40 million yuan and 26,000 U.S. dollars of public funds to a
company in the city of Zhuhai, a special economic zone in south
China.
</P>
<P>
After obtaining a visa for Ecuador illegally, Zhou fled to
that country in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
Chinese police discovered in March of 1999 that Zhou had
illicitly obtained a residence permit and citizenship in the
Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
The ministry immediately began to amass evidences against Zhou
and informed the police authorities in Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
Zhou was seized by police in Ecuador on May 11, and brought
back to China yesterday. The case is still under investigation.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Meeting Calls for Regional Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN Chambers of Commerce and
Industry (CCI) Thursday called on the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) to implement its action plan and the
measures proposed to promote regional integration to restore ASEAN
economic vitality.
</P>
<P>
In a joint press statement issued here at the end of its
three-day 56th Council Meeting, ASEAN CCI stressed the need for
the private sector to continue to be the engine of growth in the
region in order to ensure the success of the Hanoi Plan of Action
adopted at the ASEAN summit held in Hanoi last year.
</P>
<P>
The meeting reiterated the call on ASEAN governments to become
more market-driven and provide a business environment that
encourages entrepreneurship, more private ownership, consistent
policies and transparent regulations.
</P>
<P>
The existence of such conditions is essential to encouraging
intra-ASEAN cross-border investments which are the primary aim of
the Framework Agreement on the ASEAN Investment Area, the
statement added.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that the move toward achieving regional market
integration should not be hindered by inclination toward
protectionism. It added that the ASEAN Free Trade Area will enable
ASEAN to evolve into an integrated market of nearly half a billion
people and enhance the ability of the grouping to attract foreign
direct investment and promote restructuring of companies in the
region to meet global competition.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN should also expedite the elimination of non-tariff trade
barriers, it said.
</P>
<P>
The statement strongly encouraged the use of mutual recognition
arrangements to eliminate barriers arising from differences in
technical and quality standards.
</P>
<P>
The chambers voiced support for the candidacy of Supachai
Panichapat, deputy prime minister and minister of commerce of
Thailand, for the director-general of the World Trade
Organization.

are Russia and the United States, due to reasons ranging from lack
of financial support and conflicting schedule. The participants
are from Australia, Canada, Germany, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea,
Ukraine, Hong Kong and hosts China.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, which is now a special administrative region of
China, is represented at the event by a single diver.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Swimming Association (CSA) has entered two teams,
fielding such world-class divers as former Olympic and world
champion as well as World Cup winners Fu Mingxia, Xiong Ni and Sun
Shuwei.
</P>
<P>
But the veteran Chinese face an increasingly tough challenge
from such teenager stars as Sang Xue, Liang Xiaoqiao and Guo
Jingjing.
</P>
<P>
For Chinese, the Wenzhou event is one of the five meetings
through which they could obtain qualifying points for their
individual participation at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney.
Other qualifying events include two national events, two
international competitions and the 2000 FINA Diving World Cup in
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
There are six events in the Grand Prix meeting starting here on
Friday: one-meter and three-meter springboard events and 10-meter
platform events for men and women.
</P>
<P>
The Wenzhou event closes on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Mallon Urges Setting up N.Irish Executive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's Deputy First
Minister Seamus Mallon called for both sides in the standoff to
end the deadlock and establish the local executive as early as
possible.
</P>
<P>
"We do not have any more time to waste," said Mallon, also
deputy leader of the Social Democratic and Labor Party in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
Mallon called on the Ulster Unionists and Sinn Fein to move
away from their absolutist positions to end the deadlock over
decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair has set a deadline of June 30 for a
settlement to the deadlock over the decommissioning of
paramilitary weapons -- the issue which has delayed the setting up
of the ruling body in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
Ulster Unionist Party has said the Irish Republican Army or IRA
must begin a credible and verifiable weapons handover before its
political wing Sinn Fein can take its two seats in the 10 member
executive.
</P>
<P>
But Sinn Fein insists decommissioning is not a condition under
the Good Friday Agreement.
</P>
<P>
Failure to set up the cabinet on time "would be a victory for
those who thrive on division, death and destruction," Mallon said.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN, EU to Strengthen Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) and the European Union (EU) agreed to strengthen
cooperation in trade and investment during their 13th Joint
Cooperation Committee (JCC) meeting, which ended here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Director-General of the Thai Foreign Ministry's Department of
ASEAN Affairs Anucha Osthanon said progress was also made on
narcotics and environmental cooperation.
</P>
<P>
A joint work program, called "New Dynamics in EU and ASEAN
Relations Work Plan," was signed during the meeting, which opened
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
EU's Emiliano Fossati, who co-chaired the ASEAN-EU JCC meeting
with Anucha, said the joint work plan would help strengthen
cooperation between the two regions in such areas as trade,
investment, tourism, intellectual property apart from that in
narcotics and environment fields.
</P>
<P>
The 13th ASEAN-EU JCC meeting was resumed after a nearly
two-year break due to a diplomatic dispute over the presence of
Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The EU canceled earlier JCC meetings and a ministerial meeting
earlier this year in Berlin, saying Myanmar is poor in human
rights record.
</P>
<P>
So long as the EU sticks to its stance against Yangon, greater
cooperation between the two regions will be difficult, analysts
here said.
</P>
<P>
No date of the next ASEAN-EU JCC meeting and even the meetings
of the Sub-Committees on Narcotics and Environment was set during
the 13th JCC meeting.

WASHINGTON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The United States repeated its
concern on Thursday over the resurgent fighting in Kashmir and
called upon India and Pakistan to halt conflict.
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned about the rising escalation of violence in
Kashmir," said Michael Hammer, a spokesman for the National
Security Council. "We have appealed to the governments in both
India and Pakistan to abide by the terms of the Lahore accords."
</P>
<P>
India and Pakistan agreed in February at a summit in the
Pakistani city of Lahore to solve dispute over Kashmir peacefully.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ambassador to India Richard Celeste carried the
Clinton administration's appeal for restraint to India's defense
minister and U.S. diplomats in Islamabad met with Pakistani
officials in a separate visit, Hammer said.
</P>
<P>
So far, U.S. officials have yet to send a senior State
Department envoy to either capital.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Philippine Senate Ratifies VFA Amid Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Senate ratified
Thursday evening the Philippines-U.S. Visiting Forces Agreement
(VFA) by a vote of 18 for and 5 against.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, thousands of protesters rallied in the rain outside
the senate building against the ratification of the controversial
pact.
</P>
<P>
A TV survey conducted Thursday showed that nearly 60 percent of
the Filipinos are against the VFA.
</P>
<P>
Under the Philippine Constitution, the VFA needs at least 16
votes or two-thirds of the 23-member senate to be ratified.
</P>
<P>
The VFA, which was signed by Philippine and U.S. officials last
year, would allow the United States to resume major ship visits
and large-scale joint war exercises in the Philippines which were
suspended in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Supporters say the VFA will help protect regional peace and
stability and strengthen the Philippine Armed Forces as well as
the political, economic and security linkages with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
But critics say the pact would limit the Philippine
government's right to prosecute American soldiers who commit
crimes in the country, promote prostitution and drag the
Philippines into conflicts with enemies of the United States.
</P>
<P>
During the debates, Senator Teofisto Guingona said the VFA will
place the Philippines on unequal footing with the United States
because "Filipino soldiers who will be going to the U.S. are not
going to enjoy the same protection as U.S. personnel enjoyed in
the Philippines."
</P>
<P>
Senator Aquilino Pimentel said he rejected the VFA because it
is silent on the constitutional ban on the entry of nuclear
weapons into the Philippines by visiting U.S. forces.
</P>
<P>
Loren Legarda, the youngest senator, said she voted against it
because the Philippine Constitution states that there should be no
foreign troops based in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, there is no provision in the pact for the
protection of the environment, Legarda said.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want a repeat of the experience in Clark and Subic
where the U.S. military forces left toxic wastes and refused to
clean them," she said.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, protesters have held almost daily
demonstrations outside the Philippine Senate and the U.S. Embassy.
</P>
<P>
Anti-VFA groups held a vigil in front of the senate from
Wednesday night. A group of running priests with a giant streamer
against the VFA held a brief demonstration in front of the U.S.
Embassy early Thursday morning and ran later to the senate
building to join other protesters.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday morning, a group of women installed an altar
with the image of Virgin Mary and held a mass in front of the U.S.
Embassy after setting American flags on fire.
</P>
<P>
Several hundred soldiers and policemen were deployed in front
of the Senate building Thursday to guard against the angry
protesters.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines' two largest rebel groups, National Democratic
Front (NDF) and Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), have
threatened to terminate peace talks with the government if the VFA
is ratified, saying the accord would negate their future demands
for reforms.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines signed a Mutual Defense Treaty with Washington
in 1951. Officials in both countries say joint exercises are
needed to ensure good cooperation and communication between the
two militaries.
</P>
<P>
A separate agreement shielding U.S. military personnel from
prosecution for crimes committed in the Philippines was canceled
by Manila in December 1996, prompting the United States to halt
major military exercises with the country.
</P>
<P>
Military ties with the United States, which ruled the
Philippines for nearly half a century, have remained a sensitive
issue since the Philippine Senate forced the closure of the last
U.S. base in 1992.

<HEADLINE> CPC Senior Official Meets Kazakhstan Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua)-- Wei Jianxing, a member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), met with a
delegation from the Republic Party of "Otan" of Kazakhstan here
today.
</P>
<P>
Wei, also a member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central
Committee, spoke highly of the bilateral relations, describing
Kazakhstan as a friendly neighbor of China.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of diplomatic ties, bilateral relations
have witnessed sound, healthy and smooth progress in various
fields, and high-level contacts have been frequent, Wei said.
</P>
<P>
According Wei, the two countries have signed important
agreement on petroleum exploration, successfully settled border
issues, and reached agreement with Russia and three other
countries on disarmament and military confidence-building in
border areas.
</P>
<P>
China highly appreciates President Nursultan Nazarbayev's
solemn position of not allowing any activities in Kazakhstan aimed
at splitting China, and looks forward to his next visit, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Republic Party of "Otan" has grown into the
most important political force in Kazakhstan, although it is still
young, and the CPC is willing to deepen mutual understanding with
"Otan" and strive to promote bilateral friendship through joint
efforts.
</P>
<P>
S.A. Tereshchenko, president of "Otan" and head of the
delegation, said Kazakhstan has great interest in China's
experience in reform and opening up, expects to expand bilateral
cooperation, and welcomes more Chinese enterprises to invest in
his country.

<HEADLINE> Feeble Shock Hits Northern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- An earthquake measuring 4.9 on the
Richter scale shook the northern Philippines Thursday afternoon,
but no damage was expected, the Philippine Institute of
Volcanology and Seismology said.
</P>
<P>
In a preliminary report issued here, the institute said the
epicenter was in Iba, 59 kilometers north of Zambles.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake occurred at 14:18 (06:18 GMT) and aftershocks
were expected, the institute said.
</P>
<P>
The possible source of the feeble shock is from the Manila
trench, it said.
</P>
<P>
The quake was felt in Manila and buildings in the area swung
for at least half a minute.
</P>
<P>
Earthquakes with a magnitude of four to five on the Richter
scale are unlikely to cause damage, but are felt generally by
people indoors and by few people outdoors.
</P>
<P>
Seismologists say the Philippines is hit by an average of six
earthquakes every day but most of them are too weak to be felt.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Unravel Origin of Birds' Feather (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- A group of dinosaur experts infer
that the feather of modern birds most likely originate from down-
like integumentary structures on a new kind of dinosaur they found
in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
The British journal Nature will publish the astonishing find in
its upcoming issue on May 27, a spokesman with the Institute of
Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology under the Chinese
Academy of Sciences (CAS) said at a news briefing today.
</P>
<P>
"Most interestingly, this new dinosaur has integumentary
filaments as in sinosauropteryx," said Xu Xing, a researcher with
the institute, claiming that the integumentary structures evolved
into bird feather.
</P>
<P>
Heated argument on the link between dinosaurs and birds has
been going on for at least a century and a half, since naturalist
Thomas Huxley noted their similarities in the mid-1800s.
</P>
<P>
The two specimens of sinosauropteryx, or bird-like dinosaur,
found in the tiny village of Sihetun in 1996 in Liaoning Province
added fuel to the worldwide debate.
</P>
<P>
 "Feather are complex structures," Xu said in an interview
with Xinhua. "Their abrupt appearance in the bird fossil record
has been perplexing mainly because no intermediate structures are
preserved in the related theropod dinosaur."
</P>
<P>
The integumentary filaments of sinosauropteryx are considered
primitive feather by some but the idea is rejected by others, Xu
said.

At the end of last year, Xu and his two colleagues Tang Zhilu
and Wang Xiaolin, co-authors of the Nature essay, stumbled upon
the fossilized new type of dinosaur which was named Beipiaosaurus
and dated back some 124 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Such structures have not been preserved with any other
theropods until the discovery of Beipiaosaurus," Xu wrote in
Nature article.
</P>
<P>
"Most integumentary filaments are about 50 mm in length,
although the longest is up to 70 mm," he said. "Some have
indications of branching distal ends."
</P>
<P>
Xu ascertained that the structures are primitive feather.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old dinosaur specialist suggested that such feather-
like structures have a broad distribution among non-avian
theropods, and supports the hypothesis that filamentous
integumentary structures may be homologous to the feather of birds.
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts have discovered four kinds of theropods with
feather in Beipiao County, a hotbed of extinct animal and plant
fossils.
</P>
<P>
The volcano-rich region of Beipiao has revealed at least four
complete sets of feathered theropods, which have rarely been seen
in other place in China or anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
Xu and other researchers are focusing on the histological and
physiological study of these fossilized creature.
</P>
<P>
Nature and the National Geographic of the United States have
published several reports and articles on feathered dinosaurs.

TEHRAN, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Some 1,100 kilograms of narcotic
drugs were seized Wednesday night in Iran's southeastern province
of Sistan-Baluchestan, a senior Iranian security official
announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The provincial commander Brigadier General Naser Shabani said
the drugs, consisting of opium and hashish, were seized following
a gun fight between security forces and armed smugglers in the Lar
border region, some 30 kilometers southeast of the provincial
capital Zahedan, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Iranian security forces also seized 5,300 kilograms of narcotic
drugs Monday following armed clashes with drug traffickers in the
province, which borders Afghanistan and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Shabani said Tuesday that 9,365 kilograms of various narcotics
have been seized from smugglers in the province since the outset
of the current Iranian calendar year starting March 21.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said Iran seized over 195 tons of various
narcotics over the last Iranian calendar year which ended March 20.
</P>
<P>
Iran initiated a strict anti-drug campaign in 1989 after the
Majlis (parliament) passed a law allowing capital punishment

JERUSALEM, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of Palestinians ended
their sit-in Thursday afternoon at Ras Al-Amud in East Jerusalem
after the Israeli police released four participants who were
arrested and beaten earlier.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians staged the sit-in from Thursday morning to
protest against Israel's housing construction at Ras Al-Amud and
the Palestinian protestors clashed with Israeli police who tried
to intervene.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Minister for Jerusalem
Affairs Faisal Husseini, members of the Palestinian Legislative
Council (PLC) Hanan Ashrawi and Hatem Abdel Qader, as well as
several Israeli Arab Knesset (parliament) members participated in
the sit-in.
</P>
<P>
All above mentioned VIPs and other Palestinian prostetors were
subjected to violence and abuse by the Israeli police during the
scuffle which occurred shortly after noon.
</P>
<P>
During the scuffle, four Palestinians, including Ashrawi's
bodyguard, were arrested, while several others, including local
journalists working for foreign media, were injured.
</P>
<P>
Qader and another PLC member Ahmad Al-Batsh, were admitted to
Makassed Hospital for injury treatment.
</P>
<P>
Qader told reporters later that in the attack, the Israeli
police used rubber clubs and rifle butts to beat the participants
and he said he did not understand why the Israeli police reacted
so violently towards the Palestinians who conducted their sit-in
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
"We consider constructing the settlement there (in Ras
Al-Amud) as a criminal act, every settlement activity is a
criminal act and we will continue our efforts to halt such
activities," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ras Al Amud is a "hot spot" in East Jerusalem. Local
Palestinians refuse to let the Israeli right-wing groups to build

<HEADLINE> British Judge Turns Down Pinochet Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- A British High Court on Thursday
refused a permission to challenge the extradition of Former
Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
Justice Harry Ognall in the High Court ruled that hearing an
appeal at this stage would "go only needlessly to disrupt the
extradition process."
</P>
<P>
"It would be wrong for me to grant permission for judicial
review in this case," Ognall said.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet's lawyers lodged an appeal to the high court for
reviewing the British government's decision to allow extradition
proceedings against the retired general. They argued that Home
Secretary Jack Straw "misdirected himself in law and acted
irrationally" in authorizing proceedings against Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
The lawyers also argued that Jack Straw had not properly
considered all factors in the case, especially whether the charges
remaining against Pinochet amounted to extradition crimes.
</P>
<P>
Ognall meanwhile said lawyers for Pinochet would have "every
opportunity to advance his case" in the extradition hearing yet to
come.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, 83, was arrested in London on October 16 last year at
the request of a Spanish judge, who wants to try him on torture
allegations dating from his 1973-1990 rule in Chile.
</P>
<P>
British Law Lords, the highest court in Britain, ruled out in
March that Pinochet was responsible for the crimes committed in
Chile, but only in the period from 1988 to 1990.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Shoots Down 2 Indian Mig Fighters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Thursday shot down two
Indian Mig jet fighters that "crossed into its territory" along
the disputed Kashmir border.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Information Minister Mushahid Hussain on Thursday
afternoon confirmed the downing of Indian jets at a special joint
press conference here, which was also attended by Vice Chief of
General Staff Lt. General Anis Bajwa, Director General of
Inter-Service Public Relations Brigadier Rashid Qureshi and
Foreign Office Spokesman Tariq Altaf.
</P>
<P>
The first jet was shot down at 11:15 a.m. local time (0615
GMT) and the second at 11:35 a.m. local time (0635 GMT), Mushahid
said.
</P>
<P>
The two jets, one Mig-21 and the other Mig-27, were targeted in
the second round of India's air operations in the Line of Control
region on Thursday, the second day of an air campaign to dislodge
Pakistan-backed militants from the Indian side of the LoC.
</P>
<P>
The first round of Thursday's air operations was carried out in
early morning.
</P>
<P>
The wreckage of the two fighters fell into the
Pakistan-controlled part of Kashmir. One pilot was killed and the
other captured, according to Mushahid.
</P>
<P>
India, however, had said its air force jets had restricted
operations to the Indian side only.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the press conference, Altaf charged that "it was
India and not Pakistan which was escalating the situation."
</P>
<P>
"We call upon our friends and the international community to
realize the situation and impress upon India to observe restraint
so that the situation does not get out of hand," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Meaningful international engagement is an absolute necessity,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We hope India would realize that the volatile
situation was brought to an end."
</P>
<P>
India had been continuously refusing to accept any help from
abroad to settle the core issue of Jammu and Kashmir, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tension between Pakistan and India is mounting these days
because of the intense artillery dual that has been going on
uninterrupted for more than two weeks along the LoC in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
At least 35 soldiers are reported to have been killed along
with scores of civilians on both sides in the renewed clashes in
Kargil and Drass sectors of the LoC which divides the Kashmir
region between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan Wednesday blamed India for escalating the conflict
through launching air strikes against Kashmiris and said it will
take "all necessary actions" to defend its positions.

In a message sent to Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Mkapa said,
" Tanzania strongly condemns this unacceptable incident and
appreciates the composure of the Chinese government
notwithstanding outrageous character of the attack."
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said he wished to convey the message of sympathy and

<HEADLINE> Russia Says U.S. Defense Bill Undermines ABM Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Russia said Thursday that the U.S.
Congress' approval of a bill to deploy a national anti-missile
defense system is "another step aimed at undermining" the 1972
Soviet-U.S. Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
</P>
<P>
The move represented "a challenge to strategic stability and
international security," the Interfax news agency quoted a Russian
Foreign Ministry statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
The bill "reasserts the U.S. military-political course toward
putting in place nationwide, effective anti-missile defense making
it possible to ensure within the shortest possible time from the
technological point of view U.S. protection against a limited
ballistic attack," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The 1972 ABM Treaty prohibits the deployment of any anti-
missile defense system on a country's territory, the document
said.
</P>
<P>
"By pursuing the course toward the creation and deployment of
an anti-missile defense system on its territory, the United States
is ignoring the view of the absolute majority of world states
justly discerning in such a policy a direct threat to global
security and stability," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said Washington "by its ABM actions stimulates the
emergence and global spread of more advanced missiles (and
contributes) to unleashing a new arms race.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, such actions can lead to the destruction of the
developed structure of treaties and agreements in the field of
strategic offensive and defensive arms," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. actions "threaten the whole disarmament process,
including the preservation and consolidation of the key regimes of
the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their
means of trade," the document said.

<P>
KATHMANDU, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali Congress will work in
consultations with other political parties though it won a
majority of seats in the parliamentary elections, Congress
President and caretaker Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a farewell message read over Radio Nepal, Koirala expressed
the hope that the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified
Marxist-Leninist, CPN-UML), which comes as the second largest
party in the House of Representatives, would succeed in playing
the role of "responsible opposition."
</P>
<P>
Koirala was named in December 1998 to head a tripartite
government to oversee the general elections in May. Krishna Prasad
Bhattarai, a senior leader of the Nepali Congress, was appointed
Thursday to head the new government.
</P>
<P>
In his message to the Nepalese people, Koirala extended his
best wishes to the new government. Months before the elections
held on May 3 and May 17, Koirala had offered the post-poll
premiership to Bhattarai in a bid to patch up dissension with the
party. He said last week that he would extend full cooperation to
the new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Koirala said the new government has to work on the line of
development, security and employment as mentioned in the party's
election manifesto.
</P>
<P>
He said that despite doubts and apprehensions, the elections
were held without any problem. He described this as a "pleasant
achievement."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- China is introducing overseas funds
and expertise to provide much-needed management training for its
ten million small and medium-sized businesses.
</P>
<P>
The State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC) launched a
showcase training program on information technology for small
businesses here today funded by China Hewlett-Packard Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The 21st Century Small and Medium-sized Enterprises Training
and Development Project will offer training courses to managers of
25 small businesses around China, including private, state-owned,
and overseas-funded companies, most of which are in the
manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
"Offering training services to more than ten million small
businesses in China requires so many resources that the government
cannot do it alone," said Wang Zhongming, director of the Training
Department of SETC.
</P>
<P>
"We must tap all possible resources, including overseas funds,
to build up a service network for small businesses in with respect
to training, consultation, and research and development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wei Dong, director of the Department of Small and Medium-sized
Enterprises of SETC, said that Hewllet-Packard's funding of the
training program opens a new area of improving government services
for small businesses.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> WFP Launches Telecom Team to Facilitate Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World Food
Program (WFP) Thursday launched a service aimed at improving field
communications through a specialist team of experts.
</P>
<P>
The team, a Fast Information Technology and Telecommunications
Emergency and Support Team, is based in Kampala, Uganda's capital,
according to a press release issued by the agency's Uganda office.
</P>
<P>
The team will work primarily to enhance rapid response capacity
 throughout sub-Sahara Africa by extending and improving the flow
of information in the field wherever an emergency demands that
operational and security data be quickly and reliably
communicated.
</P>
<P>
The statement quoted Peter Casier, technical support unit
manager at WFP Great Lakes, as saying that "Communication is
crucial in any aid operation. We need to know about people's
condition, their needs, and how we can reach them."
</P>
<P>
"In many parts of Africa, the telephone lines are either
extremely bad or non-existent. Using short wave radio has proved
not only more cost effective, but also much more reliable," the
manager added.
</P>
<P>
The WFP Great Lakes Unit sealed its global reputation for rapid
response in the wake of Hurricane Mitch, when it was despatched to
Central America to set up a voice and data communications network,
serving not only the WFP, but also the U.N. agencies and partners.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, at the peak of the Rwanda/Zaire/Burundi relief
operation, a small team of technicians in the WFP Great Lakes Unit
devised the innovative Deep Field Mailing System, using HF radios
to transfer e-mails independently from electricity or telephone
lines at very low cost.
</P>
<P>
This communications revolution now covers an area of two
million square kilometers, linking up 2,000 users from 15
different U.N. agencies and non- governmental organizations in 100
bases and cars, processing over 200,000 e-mails per month.
</P>
<P>
The WFP is the U.N. front-line agency in the fight against
global hunger.
</P>
<P>
Last year, its relief workers fed 75 million people, including
most of the world's refugees. Headquartered in Rome, Italy, WFP
has food aid operations in 80 countries around the world.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Somali Aid Coordination Body
(SACB) is deeply concerned with rapidly deteriorating situation
in southern Somalia, particularly over the reported recent
arrival of arms into the country.
</P>
<P>
The aid body, comprising donors, U.N. agencies and
international non- governmental organizations, reaffirmed its
commitment to continue providing humanitarian assistance to the
needed in Somalia, according to a press release available here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
As a consequence to the increase in banditry and general
instability, the release said, it has become increasingly
difficult for international aid agencies to access vulnerable
communities in southern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
"The notable expansion of incident against international aid
agencies, with two aid workers having been murdered and another
kidnapped already this year, is of utmost concern," the release
added.
</P>
<P>
While reiterating its commitment, the SACB appeals to the
Somali leaders and communities in general, especially in southern
areas, to facilitate the work of international aid agencies to
continue carrying out their humanitarian work by ensuring
security conditions for their staff and assets.
</P>
<P>
The SACB also urged the relevant international organizations to
 encourage a peace process that would lead to reconciliation in
Somalia and ask for their renewed support in this endeavour.

<TEXT>
<P>
Small and medium-sized businesses account for 99.7 percent of
all industrial businesses in China, and employ 73 percent of the
industrial work-force. As jobs at state-owned companies had been
cut over the past few years, employment in the private sector grew
by 15 million people.
</P>
<P>
Wei said that along with improving training services for small
businesses, the government is working on favorable conditions to
finance them. The government will also issue directories of
products that it either encourages or discourages small
enterprises to produce.
</P>
<P>
He said that it will take the government three to five years to
set up a framework of policies and social services for small
businesses, and this means a great potential market for overseas
companies.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that the five-month training program for the 25
small businesses will cost Hewlett-Packard some 800,000 yuan (
about 100,000 U.S. dollars). If this is true, training for all
small businesses in China will demand 40 billion U.S. dollars
worth of goods and services.
</P>
<P>
"It's an enormous figure," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Hewlett-Packard Vice President Dick Warmington said that the
company has been working on sharing its management expertise with
Chinese businesses for the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
"We will motivate our distribution network around the country
and coordinate our partners in the IT industry to offer face-to-
face design and consultation and implementation services to local
small businesses," said Jimmy Sher, general manager of Commercial

<HEADLINE> Two Major Hospitals in Somali Capital Looted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, May 27 (Xinhua) -- After nine years of anarchy and
civil strife in Somalia, the destruction in the capital Mogadishu
still continues despite relative peace due to the existence of
Islamic courts militiamen who control the major parts of South
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The main hospitals of Martini and Digfer, both in South
Mogadishu, have been crippled after they were looted of their most
 precious equipment last week.
</P>
<P>
Ali Robleh Warfa, director of Martini hospital, told the press
 Thursday that his hospital has been looted and that apart from
the building nothing of use has remained.
</P>
<P>
Warfa said the main operational theatre for both the major and
ordinary surgery including the ophthalmic has been totally
ransacked and taken away.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more than 12,000 pieces of the internal fixation
plates worth of 50,000 U.S. dollars have also been looted.
</P>
<P>
"Those plates have been used for all kinds of fractures from a
finger to the major bones of the body," said Warfa, adding that
they have got their equipment from Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
He said seven new sets of operational utensils worth of more
than 7,000 dollars had also been stolen.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of war crippled people including children and women,
families from the former police and military live in the hospital,
some for treatment, others take it as residential quarter.
</P>
<P>
Many of the crippled have expressed concern after the only
hospital on which they depended had been stolen of its equipment.
"It is really unfortunate that our hospital which survived the
worst part of the civil war now becomes among the victims of the
anarchy," said one crippled man.
</P>
<P>
The general hospital known as Digfer, the biggest in Somalia,
has also been looted. Mohamed Hussein Abdi, the director of
Digfer hospital, has declared that his hospital can no longer
operate after its modern German- donated X-ray apparatus has been
looted.
</P>
<P>
Independent sources confirmed that the X-ray has been put in a
house in Huriwa district of South Mogadishu controlled by faction
leader Hussein Mohamed Aidid.
</P>
<P>
In the beginning of the anarchy, some unscrupulous businessmen
had looted the country to the teeth by taking away all of the
major factories and sold them abroad.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Chambers of Commerce On Recovery From Economic Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN Chambers of Commerce and
Industry (CCI) Thursday called on both the private and public
sectors to learn from the regional economic crisis and restructure
to boost investor confidence for recovery from the crisis.
</P>
<P>
In a joint press statement issued here Thursday evening at the
end of the three-day 56th Council Meeting of CCI of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the chamber noted
that progress in reform has been made especially by the affected
countries.
</P>
<P>
The chamber recommends the adoption of measures to stimulate
demand in Asia as a main source of economic growth in addition to
export-led strategies to ensure a sustainable economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
The chamber warned against overborrowing and quick liquidation
of companies to ensure continued survival of viable ASEAN
corporations through sound corporate debt restructuring, improved
corporate governance and accountability.
</P>
<P>
The chamber stressed the development of an ASEAN bond market as
an alternative source of financing to avoid over-dependence on the
banking system for funds and to meet the financial needs of
long-term projects.
</P>
<P>
The chamber emphasized the need to learn from the current
crisis to exercise caution in their diversification strategy
especially into non-core businesses.
</P>
<P>

<P>
China has never changed its position, viewpoint and attitude on
accession into the World Trade Organization (WTO), Chinese Foreign

conference.

China has a consistent position on WTO negotiations, he

As a developing country, China can only undertake obligations
that are commensurate with its national strength at present, he
noted.

<HEADLINE> 4 Kurdish Rebels Killed in Southeastern Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Four rebels of the illegal Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK) Thursday were killed in a military operation
staged by the Turkish security forces in southeastern Turkey, the
semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that acting on a tip-off, the security forces
besieged a group of the PKK militants near Baspinar village in
Kemaliye town of Erzincan province and exchanged fires with the
PKK.
</P>
<P>
The security forces killed four PKK guerrillas in the armed
clash, the report said, adding that three soldiers of the security
forces were slightly wounded.
</P>
<P>
The agency reported that the death toll of the PKK militants
may increase in the clash.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting since 1984 for an independent
Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey. Conflicts between the
Turkish government and the PKK have claimed over 37,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan was captured by Turkish special
agents in Kenya in mid-February and has been detained on Imrali
Island in Marmara Sea near Turkey's western province of Bursa for
trials on charges of treason.

<HEADLINE> Over 400,000 Ugandans Receive HIV/AIDS Tests Since </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Over 400,000 Ugandans have tested
for HIV/ AIDS at the AIDS Information Center (AIC) sites in the
country's districts of Kampala, Mbarara, Mbale and Jinja since
1990.
</P>
<P>
The information is released by a national HIV/AIDS voluntary
counselling and testing symposium held at the International
Conference Center here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the figures released by the AIDS Information
Center, a total of 53,854 people have received voluntary
counselling and testing in 1998 alone, six times more than in
1990.
</P>
<P>
Among those tested, two thirds were female in 1990 and now the
female- male ratio is 1:1.
</P>
<P>
The Information Center has expanded voluntary counselling and
testing to 41 government and non-governmental organization
hospitals and health centers in 21 districts of Uganda.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the establishment of testing facilities,
Uganda's seropositivity rate has dropped significantly. The
HIV-positive rate for female has fallen from over 35 percent eight
years ago to the current level of 27 percent while that for male
decreased from 24 percent to 15 percent over the same period.
</P>
<P>
The Center findings also show that females are more vulnerable
to the epidemic than males. Divorced and separated females are
extremely viable to be infected.
</P>
<P>
The vulnerability to the disease is highly related to one's
level of education. The illiterate are mostly likely to suffer.
About 28 percent of male and 40 percent of female in this category
prove to be HIV positive while of those who have received
secondary education, the rates drop to 13 percent and 21 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The symposium called upon people, young people in particular,
to go and test, because it is good for themselves and for the
society in general.

<HEADLINE> K.P. Bhattarai Named New Prime Minister of Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Nepali King Birendra Thursday
appointed Nepali Congress senior leader Krishna Prasad Bhattarai
to head the first majority government in Nepal in four and half
years, a Royal Palace source said.
</P>
<P>
The appointment came as no surprise because Bhattarai was
offered the premiership months before the just-concluded elections
to the House of Representatives by Congress party president and
caretaker Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali Congress won a majority of 110 seats in the
205-member House of Representatives. Bhattarai was elected earlier
the party's parliamentary party leader.
</P>
<P>
Under the kingdom's constitution, the king appoints the leader
of the parliamentary party having a majority in the house as the
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Bhattarai, 75, has said his top priority will be poverty
eradication, followed by education and employment.
</P>
<P>
Bhattarai headed an interim government from April 1990 to May
1991 to draft a new constitution for the kingdom and hold the
first general elections after the multi-party parliamentary system
was restored in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Six governments had ruled the kingdom in the past four and half
a years after the mid-term polls in November 1994 produced a hung
parliament, where no single party commanded a majority.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Patients in China to Receive Cocktail Therapy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Combination therapy against HIV/
AIDS, known as "cocktail therapy," is being introduced in China to
treat AIDS patients since the state drug authorities approved
imports of anti-HIV drugs.
</P>
<P>
The National Center for AIDS Prevention and Control (NCAIDS)
and Ditan Hospital in Beijing announced they will provide triple-
drug therapy to 18 carriers of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus)
that causes AIDS ( acquired immune deficiency syndrome) in mid-
June, and to 12 others late this year.
</P>
<P>
The State Drug Administration has given approval to the import
of six types of anti-HIV drugs since late 1997. The SDA even
allowed the entry of drugs which did not undergo long-term
clinical tests because their effectiveness was confirmed, and
domestic patients have urgent needs, a SDA official told Xinhua
today.
</P>
<P>
Some foreign pharmaceutical firms have applied for
certification from the SDA, and their products may be available
this year or next, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Although the number of treated patients is far less than the
400,000 people infected by HIV nationwide, the majority of whom
have little access to effective medication, NCAIDS experts believe
this new action will bring about greater availability of such
service.
</P>
<P>
"It has become very urgent to provide proper and effective
treatment against HIV/AIDS in China since the epidemic situation
is getting serious," said Professor Cao Yunzhen, deputy director
of the NCAIDS.
</P>
<P>
Though combination therapy can keep the virus at bay, its price
is dear -- at about 100,000 yuan ( 12,000 U.S. dollars) for a
year's course. Few patients in China can afford the treatment.
</P>
<P>
"The money is the biggest problem. But we're making every
effort to help the patients, whether through raising funds by
patients themselves or asking help from pharmaceutical companies
and charity groups."
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing is to act right now to save their
lives. It's also a key measure to block the further spread of the
virus," said Prof. Cao, who has worked in the United States at the
Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center led by Professor David Ho,
known as one of the originators of the "cocktail therapy."
</P>
<P>
Cao, now in charge of clinical virology research at NCAIDS and
a clinic at Ditan Hospital, said training medical personnel across
the country is also important.
</P>
<P>
A training course will be offered by NCAIDS this October to
help doctors from all over the country master the complicated
triple-drug treatment.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, clinical research combining Western medicine
and traditional Chinese herbal medicines will be conducted to see
whether the human immune system can be restored while clearing HIV
in the blood.
</P>
<P>
If successful, it will be a special contribution by the Chinese
to the battle against HIV/AIDS, Cao said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Senate Ratifies VFA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Senate ratified
Thursday evening the Philippines-U.S. Visiting Forces Agreement
(VFA) by a vote of 18 for and 5 against.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, thousands of protesters rallied in the rain outside
the senate building against the ratification of the controversial
pact.
</P>
<P>
A survey conduct by SNN TV Thursday showed that nearly 60
percent Filipinos are against the VFA.
</P>
<P>
Under the Philippine Constitution, the VFA needs at least 16
votes or two-thirds of the 23-member senate to be ratified.
</P>
<P>
The VFA, which was signed by Philippine and U.S. officials last
year, would allow the United States to resume major ship visits
and large-scale joint war exercises in the Philippines which were
suspended in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Supporters say the VFA will help protect regional peace and
stability and strengthen the Philippine Armed Forces as well as
the political, economic and security linkages with the United
states.
</P>
<P>
But critics say the pact would limit the Philippine
government's right to prosecute American soldiers who commit
crimes in the country, promote prostitution and drag the
Philippines into conflicts with enemies of the United States.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, protesters have held almost daily
demonstrations in front of the Philippine Senate and the U.S.
Embassy.
</P>
<P>
The two largest rebel groups, National Democratic Front (NDF)
and Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), in the Philippines have
threatened to terminate peace talks with the government if the VFA
is ratified, saying the accord would negate their future demands
for reforms.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines signed a Mutual Defense Treaty with Washington
in 1951. Officials in both countries say joint exercises are
needed to ensure good cooperation and communication between the
armed forces of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Military ties with the United States, which ruled the
Philippines for nearly half a century, have remained a sensitive
issue since the Philippine Senate forced the closure of the last
U.S. base in 1992.

</P>
<P>
"The brutal atrocity of the U.S.-led NATO occurred at a time
when our country has achieved major breakthroughs in the reform
and opening-up drive and is assuming an increasingly important
role in the world arena," says the editorial, entitled "
Unswervingly Push the Reform and Opening Up."
</P>
<P>
Describing China's reform and opening-up policy as a "great
historical change," the editorial says that the policy has brought
fundamental changes to the destiny of both the Chinese nation and
socialism.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the reform and opening-up policy, it says, China's
social productive forces have been greatly emancipated and
developed over the past two decades, with the people's life and
the country's comprehensive national strength and international
status constantly improved.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, we must spare no effort to ensure the advancement
and final success of the reform and opening-up drive, and we can't
afford any setbacks or failure," it adds.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Space Shuttle Discovery Blasts Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- With seven astronauts on board,
the U.S. NASA's space shuttle Discovery was lifted off this
morning at 6:50 (local time) from the Kennedy Space Center, Cape
Canaveral, for the first docking with the constructing
International Space Station in orbit.
</P>
<P>
During its 10-day flight which is the first one since last
December, the space shuttle will dock with the international space
station for six days and crew members of the seven astronauts will
unload more than 4,300 pounds of cargo for the space station.
</P>
<P>
The supplies include laptop computers, cameras, canvas bags of
maintenance tools, two cranes and seven 95-gallon bags of drinking
water siphoned from the shuttle's electricity-generating fuel
cells. Water is a byproduct of power production.
</P>
<P>
These goods will be carried into the space station for the
first crew, two Russians and an American who will arrive early
next year.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, two astronauts will walk in space for a day
to mount parts of two construction cranes, one made in the United
States and the other in Russia, to their respective components.
Members of the crew will also try to repair a Russian power
storage system and an American communication system on the space
station.

<HEADLINE> China Firm to Continue Reform, Opening Up (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since it is an "unprecedented" attempt in the world, says the
editorial, it is quite natural for China's reform and opening-up
efforts to meet difficulties and resistance, as well as various
disturbances and sabotage from hostile forces both inside and
outside China.
</P>
<P>
"However, there is no difficulty or circumstance that can sway
our determination and slow down our pace of reform and opening-up,
" it says.
</P>
<P>
The editorial goes on to say that China will continue to carry
out economic and technological exchanges and cooperation with
foreign countries, protect the legitimate rights and interests of
all overseas investors and business people according to law, and
further expand the scope of opening up to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
"This is conducive not only to China's own development, but
also to the development of all other countries, including
developed Western countries," it stresses.
</P>
<P>
While never allowing any other countries to infringe upon
China's sovereignty and dignity with any excuses, the editorial
says, the Chinese government and people are willing to develop
friendly relations and seek common development with the rest of
the world on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-
existence.
</P>
<P>
"Our reform and opening-up drive has a promising future and we
will have friends all over the world," concludes the editorial.

<HEADLINE> India Admits Loosing 2 Fighter Jets in Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Indian Defense Ministry sources
Thursday admitted that India lost two fighter jets during
Thursday's air operation in the disputed Kashmir area and one of
them was shot down by Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
They said two Indian Air Force (IAF) Mig fighter jets were lost
in the operations against "Pakistani infiltrators" in the Kargil
sector of Kashmir, one of which was shot down by a Pakistani
missile and the other had a technical snag.
</P>
<P>
A Mig-21 aircraft had engine failure while participating in the
fourth round of strikes at around 11:00 local time. The pilot gave
a distress call as he ejected from the plane, Air Vice Marshal
Malik said here.
</P>
<P>
As a Mig-27 jet which received the call flew low to locate the
pilot of Mig-21 aircraft, it was fired at from across the Line of
Control by a surface-to-air missile, he said.
</P>
<P>
This was a "hostile and provocative act as we were operating
within the Indian territory close to the Line of Control. The
other side has escalated the situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Following this, extraordinary measures were being taken and the
operation against the infiltration would continue, he said. But he
did not elaborate on the extraordinary measures India was taking.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Russia-Belgrade Envoy Trip to Belgrade Delayed, Talks Hit Snag </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin's
planned trip to Belgrade was delayed Thursday when the protracted
talks on Yugoslavia attended by the envoy, U.S. Deputy Secretary
of State Strobe Talbott and Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari hit
a new snag in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The sides, which took a break to consult with their experts
and advisers, will resume the talks late Thursday, the Itar-Tass
news agency quoted Chernomyrdin's adviser Valentin Sergeyev as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of tripartite talks started Wednesday and
might well stretch into the night Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev said Chernomyrdin's trip to Belgrade Thursday was
still on, but his departure was delayed.
</P>
<P>
"All depends on when the talks end," Sergeyev said.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that the talks were proceeding with difficulty
but added, "this is a normal process for such a sophisticated
issue."
</P>
<P>
"A precipitate decision does not meet anyone's interests," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Chernomyrdin on Thursday reiterated
Moscow's threat to pull out of the talks if NATO bombings on
Yugoslavia did not end soon.
</P>
<P>
In an article published in The Washington Post, Chernomyrdin
said NATO should end the air campaign because it was impossible to
negotiate a peace settlement when the bombs were falling.
</P>
<P>
"I shall advise Russia's president (Boris Yeltsin) to suspend
Russian participation in the negotiating process, put an end to
all military-technological cooperation with the United States and
Western Europe, put off the ratification of START II and use
Russia's veto as the United Nations debates a resolution on
Yugoslavia," Chernomyrdin said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that on this issue Russia would "find
understanding from great powers such as China and India."
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said NATO's air strikes on Yugoslavia, which
entered the 65th day Thursday, had "set back Russia-U.S. relations
by several decades."
</P>
<P>
He refuted a statement by U.S. President Bill Clinton that
Russia was allegedly helping NATO to make Belgrade meet its
conditions.

FUZHOU, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese border police in Fuzhou,
capital of the coastal province of Fujian in southeast China, on
Wednesday morning intercepted at sea 90 Chinese citizens
attempting to sneak into the United States by taking a boat from
the Republic of Korea (ROK), local authorities announced today.
</P>
<P>
The police also arrested 17 "snakeheads," or organizers of the
illegal immigration, including four ROK nationals.
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman for the local police department, the
Fuzhou police took notice of the illegal immigration plan some two
weeks ago, as several ROK citizens paid frequent visits to the
city and plotted with some local snakeheads.
</P>
<P>
An investigation led police to the people who tried to use an
ROK boat to smuggle the Chines citizens, and after the boat
arrived at Mawei Port in Fuzhou on May 25 it was placed under
close police surveillance.

MOSCOW, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Foreign Ministry on

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Shoots Down 2 Indian Mig Fighters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Thursday claimed to have
shot down two Indian Mig-27 jet fighters that it said had crossed
into its territory along the disputed Kashmir border.
</P>
<P>
The first jet was shot down at 11:15 a.m. local time (0615 GMT)
and the second at 11:35 p.m. local time (0635 GMT), military
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The two jets were targeted in the second round of India's air
operations in the Line of Control (LoC) region Thursday, the
second day of an air campaign to dislodge Pakistan-backed
militants from the Indian side of the LoC.
</P>
<P>
The first round of Thursday's air operations was carried out in
the early morning.
</P>
<P>
The wreckage of the two fighters fell into the
Pakistan-controlled part of Kashmir. One pilot was killed and the
other captured, according to Pakistani Information Minister
Mushahid Hussain.
</P>
<P>
India said its air force jets had restricted operations to the
Indian side only, but Pakistan claimed that Indian aircraft had
intruded into Pakistani territory.
</P>
<P>
Tension between the two estranged South Asian neighbors has
been mounting these days because of the intense artillery dual
that has been going on uninterrupted for more than two weeks along
the LoC in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
At least 35 soldiers are reported to have been killed along
with scores of civilians on both sides in the renewed clash in
Kargil and Drass sectors of the LoC which divides the Kashmir
region between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan Wednesday blamed India for escalating the conflict
through launching air strikes against Kashmiris and said it would
take "all necessary actions" to defend its positions.

<HEADLINE> Jezzine Pullback Not Signal of Israeli Withdrawal: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The planned evacuation of a South
Lebanon Army (SLA) battalion in the Jezzine Enclave in southern
Lebanon was not a signal of a large withdrawal of Israeli troops,
an Israeli officer said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted Shaul Mofaz, Israeli army chief of general
staff, as saying that the decision to pullback the Israeli-backed
SLA militiamen from Jezzine was made by SLA commander Antoin Lahad.
</P>
<P>
Mofaz stressed that the pullback was not linked to Israeli
Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak's plan to withdraw Israeli troops
from southern Lebanon within one year.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Israel would deliberate the strategic steps of
withdrawal according to the negotiations at the political level
and the army's assessment of situation.
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Israel set up a "security zone" in its occupied
southern Lebanon allegedly to protect its northern border areas
from being attacked by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanese resistance forces spearheaded by the
Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to oust Israeli
occupation troops and the SLA from the territory.
</P>
<P>
Barak has pledged that he would soon resume peace talks with
Lebanon and Syria in order to withdraw the Israeli troops from
southern Lebanon in a year.
</P>
<P>
The Jezzine enclave is situated at the extreme north of the
"security zone" with about 170 SLA soldiers stationed there.
</P>
<P>
Local daily Haaretz quoted the Israeli defense sources as
saying on Thursday that Lahad initiated the idea to withdraw from
Jezzine after several senior SLA officers were killed or wounded
there in Lebanese guerrilla attacks over the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that the pullback from Jezzine could be
completed within a few weeks.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Man Recovers From 170-Day Coma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese man who was in a coma for
more than 170 days has regained consciousness in a hospital in the
city of Nanjing, capital of east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Han Ping, a farmer in Jiangsu, was brought back to
consciousness on May 24 by the electric impulse therapy and can
now talk.
</P>
<P>
Han had suffered a serious traumatic head injury in an accident
last December, that left him in a coma.
</P>
<P>
In February this year, he was sent to the China Brain Recovery
Center based in Nanjing for further treatment.
</P>
<P>
Doctors in the center treated him with hyperbaric oxygenation
for over three months to help him take a change for the better,
and then decided to use the electric impulse therapy.
</P>
<P>
A three-centimeter-long electrode was fixed in Han's spinal
column near the neck during an operation on May 22. A remote
sensor was used to send electric impulses through the electrode at
regular intervals to stimulate his spinal nerves.
</P>
<P>
Han became conscious 40 hours after the operation.
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, the center has treated more than 100
persons who were in a coma, with about 80 of them regaining some
feeling in their limbs.
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 people become comatose in China every year
because of a variety of accidents.

<HEADLINE> Siberian Tiger Shows up in Northeastern Mountain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, May 27 (Xinhua) -- An endangered Siberian tiger
showed up again in Changbai Mountains recently, attacking and
eating livestock in this northeastern mountain area.
</P>
<P>
Animal experts investigated the incident and concluded from the
footprints around two slain horses that it was done by a Siberian
tiger.
</P>
<P>
The most recent incident occurred May 13 when farmer Wang
Jianqiu in Jiaohe City found one of his horses seriously bitten.
The horse later died, and two other horses were missing.
</P>
<P>
Wang searched for his horses in nearby the forests and
discovered their bodies eight days later.
</P>
<P>
A provincial forest official said this is not the first time a
Siberian tiger has attacked domestic animals this year. In the
neighboring Dunhua area, farmers have reported tigers eating their
cattle last winter and this May.
</P>
<P>
The Siberian tiger is listed by the World Wild Fund for Nature
as one of the ten most-endangered animal species in the world, and
only around 300 of them still survive.
</P>
<P>
A UN-funded field investigation by scientists from China,
Russia, and the United States found that no more than 20 Siberian
tigers are now living in the mountains of northeastern China.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 incidents have been reported of Siberian tigers
eating livestock such as horses and cattle, most of them in
Changbai Mountains, a major habitat for the tiger.

<HEADLINE> Private Sector to Take Lead in HK Cyberport Project: Financial Secretary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 27 (Xinhua) -- To ensure successful building of
the Hong Kong Cyberport, private sector must take the lead,
Financial Secretary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
government Donald Tsang said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the 3rd Ministers' Forum on Infrastructure
Development in the Asia Pacific Region currently going on at the
Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center here Thursday, the
financial secretary stressed that the conventional mode of the
government taking the lead in infrastructure projects is no longer
the appropriate way to proceed in the area of information
technology.
</P>
<P>
By conventional mode, he said, the government first took the
lead in financing such infrastructure projects as railways, roads
and airport, and then have them corporatized and privatized, and
this worked well in the past.
</P>
<P>
"But as we approach the new century - some call it the Cyber
Century - governments are turning their attention at how best to
provide the infrastructure needed in the area of information
technology," he said.
</P>
<P>
In March this year, the financial secretary announced in his
annual budget plans to develop a high-tech Cyberport in Hong Kong.
As a strategic information technology infrastructure project, it
forms part of Hong Kong's mission to develop a knowledge-based
economy and to position Hong Kong as the pre-eminent center of
innovation and technology for East Asia and beyond.
</P>
<P>
Cyberport will be built on the western shores of Hong Kong
Island. It is designed to attract a cluster of companies involved
in leading-edge IT applications and services, including multi-
media and content creation involving 3-D graphics and animation.
</P>
<P>
The development will include an ultra-modern intelligent
building complex, a state-of-the-art broadband telecommunications
and information "backbone", and a wide range of shared facilities
like high performance computers, a media laboratory, demonstration
and exhibition facilities and a cyber library.
</P>
<P>
"A successful cyber-facility would require specialists in
information technology who understand the IT industry, who know
the needs of potential tenants, who are willing themselves to be
anchor tenants, and who are able to apply IT creatively to produce
new information services that meet modern day demand, or even
create new demand," he explained, adding that "civil servants
simply cannot fit the bill".
</P>
<P>
According to him, the government will provide the land and
supporting infrastructure such as road links and sewage systems,
while the technology company which came up with the idea will
build the Cyberport and, on completion, hand it over to the
government.
</P>
<P>
To finance the project, the founding company will develop
property adjoining the site, and profits from the sale of
apartments will be shared between the government and the company.
</P>
<P>
In this way the founding company bears all the development
costs and risks and is responsible for financing the entire
project. The government bears no investment risk but receives a
share of profits from property sales and gets a Cyberport.
</P>
<P>
Such an uncommon approach will provide several advantages, such
as saving time and resources for the government.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that a private sector investor with IT expertise is
best placed to ensure that Cyberport fully meets the needs of
tenants in terms of IT and ancillary facilities," he said.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Govt Rejects Rebels' Call for Interim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Sierra Leonean government has
rejected a call by the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) for
a four-year transition government, Nigeria's The Guardian
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted an official document of the Sierra Leonean
government as saying that "the government lacks the power to
accede to the RUF's proposal for the setting up of a transitional
government in place of the present government."
</P>
<P>
The Sierra leonean government has also rejected a proposal for
a new constitution, although it would consider amending the
current one, according to the document outlining Freetown's
position on bringing peace to the war-ravaged west African
country.
</P>
<P>
The document was released for the peace talks between Sierra
Leonean President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah and the rebel RUF held in
Togolese capital Lome Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Sierra Leonean Foreign Minister Sam Banya as
saying in Lome Wednesday that his government must "remain firm on
constitutional matters because that is what democracy and good
governance is all about."
</P>
<P>
"We can't just treat the law like a piece of paper and throw it
away anytime we like," the minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to the document, the government will not hesitate to
free rebel leader Foday Sankoh, but will only do so "within the
judicial and constitutional process."
</P>
<P>
President Kabbah has said that Sankoh, who was sentenced to
death on treason charges last October, could be released only
after his death sentence appeal is heard in court.
</P>
<P>
The government also agreed that a proposal for amnesty for RUF
members would be examined, taking into consideration "gross human
rights violations committed against the citizens of this country."
</P>
<P>
The Freetown government has sent an eight-member delegation
headed by Attorney General Solomon Berewa to the talks while a
10-member delegation from rebel RUF is in Lome.
</P>
<P>
Since the rebel forces launched attacks in several parts of the
country Monday, calm has prevailed for two days and a cease-fire
agreement seemed to be holding in Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai to Clean Major River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The first phase of a major program
to clean up the Suzhou River in China's leading industrial and
commercial city of Shanghai has just received state approval and
is expected to start soon.
</P>
<P>
Scheduled to be completed by 2002 the project will cost 8.65
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The money will mainly be used to improve the quality of the
river water in the city and plant trees covering an area of 855 sq
km along the river banks.
</P>
<P>
The first 10 elements in the initial phase will include the
construction of sewage disposal plants and river dredging.
</P>
<P>
Additional pump stations will also be built to increase the
river's water volume to improve the natural filtration process.
</P>
<P>
The 120-kilometer-long Suzhou River had an abundance of fish in
the last century, when fishing by the riverbank was one of the ten
major scenic views in old Shanghai, but it became seriously
polluted as the city developed its economy.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai began to tackle the river pollution in the 1980s and
reduced polluted water by 1.4 million tons daily.
</P>
<P>
This made a visible change but failed to change the water
quality of the river enough because of a large number of pollution
sources.

<HEADLINE> Global Cooperation Needed for New Financial Architecture: HK Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Global cooperation to perfect the
international financial architecture is the key to sustaining long-
term growth of the world's financial markets, Rafael Hui, Hong
Kong's secretary for financial services, said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This cooperation can allow all countries and regions in the
world to enjoy the full benefits of market liberalization in a
truly globalized world economy, Hui noted at the Financial
Conference on Asia organized by the Hong Kong Trade Development
Council.
</P>
<P>
In his speech entitled "What Follows the Financial Turmoil",
Hui warned that history would repeat itself without the joint
effort of the international community in reforming the global
financial architecture, and formulating new rules and strategies
to cope with the massive and volatile capital flows in the
globalized economy.
</P>
<P>
Noting that rapid increase in the quantity and volatility of
capital flows had led to new problems and challenges in recent
years, Hui said there were indications that the great majority of
foreign exchange transactions were unrelated to genuine commercial
trade or hedging.
</P>
<P>
The lack of definitive data made it difficult to understand
their nature, movements and impact on financial markets and the
real economy.
</P>
<P>
"In light of the potential destabilizing effects of capital
flows, especially on emerging markets, we consider it timely to
review the existing regulatory framework," Hui said.
</P>
<P>
The ultimate objective should be to promote the free flow of
soundly based capital and the smooth-functioning of financial
markets, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are not advocating capital control. It will be illegal
under the Basic Law," Hui said.
</P>
<P>
"What we are advocating is to enhance the transparency and
surveillance of volatile short term flows," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the lack of transparency and data on some
capital flows had made it very difficult to assess the extent of
overshooting and devastation exacerbated by the activities of the
highly leveraged institutions (HLIs), including hedge funds.
</P>
<P>
Open markets, in particular the smaller ones, can be
overwhelmed by the very large and highly leveraged institutions,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Experience shows that some HLIs could generate panic in the
market by acting in concert as a pool, sometimes even using means
such as wash sales and rumor-mongering. Market integrity, which is
fundamental to the health and efficiency of a free market, is
compromised," he added.
</P>
<P>
While much of the international efforts in the past 22 months
had been on improving the transparency and accountability of the
public sector, the private sector so far was lagging behind, Hui
said.
</P>
<P>
"The problem is especially highlighted by the lack of
transparency in the over-the-counter market (OTC market), where
geographically dispersed traders are linked to one another via
telecommunications systems and computers," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This has made monitoring and surveillance difficult, thereby
raising the risk of price-ramping, collusion and other misconduct
by the larger players. This information gap may have serious
implications on market integrity and stability of the financial
system," he added.
</P>
<P>
"As long as this gap in our international financial
architecture remains unplugged, our financial system, individually
and collectively, will continue to be vulnerable to manipulative
attacks of one kind or another," he warned.
</P>
<P>
Noting that there were some encouraging recent developments on
the international front to improve transparency of the HLIs, Hui
said he looked forward to early completion of the work of the G7
Financial Stability Forum on HLIs, offshore centers and short-term
capital flows, adding that Hong Kong would continue to play an
active part in all of these endeavors.
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, measures had been taken to strengthen the
currency board system and to enhance the transparency and
disclosure in the securities and futures markets. The government
also reaffirmed the plan to consolidate the existing 12 pieces of
securities-related legislation into one, with the intention to
provide a more transparent and coherent regulatory framework and
more effective regulation in an increasingly sophisticated and
fast changing financial market.
</P>
<P>
However, a global problem calls for a global solution, Hui
pointed out. "We call for global cooperation of the industrialized
and emerging economies to perfect international financial
architecture as a matter of urgency," he concluded.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Thursday claimed to have
shot down two Indian Mig jet fighters that crossed into its
territory along the disputed Kashmir border.
</P>
<P>
The wreckage of the two fighters fell into the
Pakistan-controlled part of Kashmir. One pilot was dead and the
other was captured, said Pakistani Information Minister Mushahid
Hussain.
</P>
<P>
The attacks came as Indian fighters and helicopter gunships
launched fresh rocket strikes in Kashmir Thursday, the second day
of an air campaign to dislodge Pakistan-backed militants from the
Indian side of the Line of Control (LoC).
</P>
<P>
Tension between the two estranged South Asian neighbors has
mounting these days because of the intense artillery dual that has
been going on uninterrupted for more than two weeks along the LoC
in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
At least 35 soldiers are reported to have been killed along
with scores of civilians on both sides in the renewed clash in the
Kargil and Drass sectors of the LoC which divides the Kashmir
region between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan Wednesday blamed India for escalating the conflict
through launching air strikes against Kashmiris and said it would
take "all necessary actions" to defend its positions.

<HEADLINE> China Reshuffles Geographical Structure of Grain Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The powerful market mechanism has
begun to reshuffle grain production geographically, with more rice
grown in north China and more corn in southern China.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally southern China has to rely on corn from north
China, incurring heavy transportation costs. However, statistics
show that the corn growing area is enlarging south of the Yangtze.
Hunan Province has claimed that it can sufficiently supply itself
corn.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, rice, traditionally mainly grown in southern China,
has seen increased acreage in northeast China. Some 1.2 million ha
of rice is grown in northeast China. The ratio of its rice output
in its total grain output has ascended by over ten percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
The People's Daily reported today that some agricultural
experts are studying for ways to increase corn growing in southern
China.

PYONGYANG, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic

defense cooperation guidelines by the Japanese Senate, saying this
actually restored the right of belligerency deprived after World
War II to Japan.
</P>
<P>
The passage of the bill would also help Japan carry out its
invasion overseas under the cover of "cooperation" with the U.S.
troops, said an article published on Rodong Sinmun.
</P>
<P>
Japan, which flaunted itself as a peaceful country with "a

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Launches 1 Billion U.S. Dollar Global Bond </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kuala Lumpur, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia successfully launched
a 10-year Global Bond in New York amounting to 1.0 billion U.S.
dollars, carrying a coupon rate of 8.75 percent per annum,
reported Bernama news agency here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the launch Wednesday in a statement, First Finance
Minister Tun Daim Zainuddin said despite difficult market
conditions, the bonds were oversubscribed by 300 percent
reflecting "the confidence of investors in Malaysia's credit
standing and strong prospects of economic recovery."
</P>
<P>
The bonds, due in the year 2009, carry a spread of 330 basis
points over the 10-year U.S. treasury bills. Proceeds from the
bonds would be utilized for general development purposes, said
Daim.
</P>
<P>
"Given the prevailing market conditions and the decline in the
Emerging Market Index, the spread is considered favorable," said
Daim who has been leading a grueling 10-day roadshow covering key
Asian, European and American cities.
</P>
<P>
The bonds were subscribed by 134 high quality investors -- 49
from Asia, 23 from Europe and 62 from the United States. More than
half the value of the bond is held by U.S. account holders, a
quarter by Europeans and the remainder by Asians.
</P>
<P>
Daim said the aim of the issue was to reach as broad as
possible an investor base and to establish a fairly-priced
benchmark for Malaysian bonds.
</P>
<P>
The issue marked a successful return to the global bond market
for the government of Malaysia amidst very difficult market
conditions, he noted.
</P>
<P>
On May 11, Malaysia filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission its intention to issue up to 3.0 billion U.S. dollars
in debt securities.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry had initially planned to raise 2.0 billion
dollars, but Wednesday issued 1.0 billion, "taking into account
the widened spreads and the potential for continued unstable
market conditions," said Daim.
</P>
<P>
Second Finance Minister Datuk Mustapa Mohamed said the rest of
the amount could be raised over the next two years or rolled-over
-- affording the Malaysian government the flexibility to do so as
and when necessary.
</P>
<P>
The bonds will be listed and traded in accordance with the
rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the Stock Exchange of
Hong Kong Limited.
</P>
<P>
Mustapa said Wednesday's successful launch indicated a
"turnaround in investors' perception of Malaysia" since selective
capital and currency control measures were imposed last September
when many doubted that Malaysia would be able to access the
international capital market.
</P>
<P>
"Today's successful issue proved them wrong," said Mustapa.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Yao Autonomous County of Bama
and other 13 counties in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region announced earlier this week that they have almost
eliminated poverty in their rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Poverty has been eradicated in 47 of the 49 officially defined
poverty-ridden counties in Guangxi, according to a regional
government official.
</P>
<P>
The poverty issue in the remaining two counties, Yao Autonomous
County of Du'an and Yao Autonomous County of Dahua, is expected to
be resolved next year, the official added.
</P>
<P>
China has pledged to eliminate poverty in all rural areas by
the end of this century. Fifteen years ago, Guangxi used to be one
of the country's concentrations of poverty-stricken people, with a
total of 15 million not having enough to eat and wear.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to increased efforts to develop natural resources,
resettle people and export labor services and to greater outside
financing in loans, Guangxi's poverty-stricken population has been
decreasing at a rate of one million each year. By the end of last
year it was down to some three million, the official said.
</P>
<P>
In almost all of the previously destitute counties, the average
annual income of farmers have reached 1,500 yuan and the
illiteracy and semi-illiteracy rate has dropped to less than five
percent, he said.

<HEADLINE> Hegemonism Undermines International Disarmament Process: China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The practice of hegemonism, power
politics and "gunboat policy" will not only seriously jeopardize
world peace and development, but will also directly undermine or
even reverse international arms control and disarmament process,
Chinese Ambassador to the Conference on Disarmament (CD) Li
Changhe said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The wanton bombing of Yugoslavia by U.S. led-NATO is an "
outright military intervention against a sovereign state", said Li
at a CD plenary session.
</P>
<P>
"It not only undermines the peace in the Balkans but also
upsets the tranquillity of the world," Li said. "They even bombed
the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, grossly violating international
law and the norms governing international relations."
</P>
<P>
NATO, a typical product of the Cold War, did not disappear from
the world scene with the end of the Cold War, but has been further
expanded, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, while carrying on the air strikes against Yugoslavia,
this bloc declared its "New Strategic Concept", thus transforming
itself from a defensive military organization to a military one of
offensive nature which can extend its military operation to areas
beyond its borders and use military force against any country
without the United Nations authorization.
</P>
<P>
"If such perverse acts are to continue, the international
community would witness repetitions of similar military
interventions and attacks against those countries which firmly
safeguard their sovereignty and oppose hegemonism and power
politics," Li pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"Under such circumstances when countries which are outside
military alliance would be deprived of basic security, how could
we anticipate any progress in the field of arms control and
disarmament?" Li asked. "Should those small and weak countries be
pushed to the corner, how could they be convinced to support the
international non-proliferation regimes?"
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin pointed out when he spoke at the
CD session on March 26,that the aim of disarmament is to increase
security.
</P>
<P>
Li quoted Jiang as saying, "Disarmament should not become a
tool for stronger nations to control weaker ones, still less
should it be an instrument for a handful of countries to optimize
their armament in order to seek unilateral security superiority."
</P>
<P>
"China has all along held the view that only just, reasonable
and balanced international arms control and disarmament can
genuinely promote global peace, security and stability," Li told
the CD session.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Li also reaffirmed China's support for a call
by many CD members that CD should re-establish the Ad Hoc
Committee on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space.
</P>
<P>
"Progress in this area, just like the progress in working
mechanism on nuclear disarmament, will be conducive to making
progress in formulating the CD's integrated work program
acceptable to all," Li said. "It is the sincere hope of the
Chinese delegation that a favorable turn can come about during the
remaining weeks of the 1999 session."

<TEXT>
<P>
Liberian Information and Culture Minister Joe Mulbah said this
in Nigerian capital Abuja where he was preparing grounds for
Liberian President Charles Taylor's visit to Nigeria.  The
Guardian newspaper Thursday quoted Mulbah as saying that Taylor
would arrive in Abuja Friday for the May 29 ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
The Liberian minister noted that President Taylor's visit would
provide opportunity for Liberia, which had been accused of
supporting the rebels in Sierra Leone, to clear itself of the
allegation of complicity especially from the ECOWAS high command.
</P>
<P>
Mulbah pointed out that "we in Liberia support the ECOWAS peace
 initiative in Sierra Leone and would be stupid to do anything to
break the cease-fire which began last Month."
</P>
<P>
After the handing-over ceremony, President Taylor will intimate
 President Obasanjo and other African leaders about Liberia's
position in the Sierra Leone's crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Nigeria is playing major roles politically and economically,"
Mulbah said. "We hail the decision of the Nigerian military and
their resolve on the eve of a new millennium to return this great
nation of Africa to pluralistic democracy."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- China has never changed its
position, viewpoint and attitude on accession into the World Trade
Organization (WTO), Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao
said here today at a regular press conference.
</P>
<P>
China has a consistent position on WTO negotiations, he
reiterated, and said that what China insists on is "the balance
between rights and obligations".
</P>
<P>
As a developing country, China can only undertake obligations
that are commensurate with its national strength at present, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
China's accession to the WTO is beneficial both to the country
and the WTO, as well as the development of the world trade.
</P>
<P>
WTO will be an incomplete world trade ruling body without China
being of one of its members, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman stressed, China will never sacrifice its
fundamental interests in order to join the WTO.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Details Added China's Position on WTO Entry Unchanged: FM Spokesman (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China has spent 13 years on a bid to entry into WTO, during
which China's economy has been developing continuously, the
spokesman said, adding that China will continue its pace of
economic growth, even if its WTO talks would be prolonged.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said he has taken note of the statement in support of
China's accession to the WTO within 1999 announced recently in
Tokyo by the trade ministers of the United States, Japan, Canada
and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
"The statement is only one aspect of the matter, and it is more
important to take concrete actions to fulfill their commitments,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO's attack on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade
has badly impaired the relations between China and the United
States, and also damaged the atmosphere of their WTO negotiations,
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the urgent matter is that the U.S. side should
immediately conduct a comprehensive, thorough, serious and
responsible inspection over the incident and punish those
responsible.

<HEADLINE> S. Africans Abroad Go to Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 26 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's second
democratic election got underway Wednesday as South Africans
working and studying abroad cast special votes at the country's
foreign missions.
</P>
<P>
However, in terms of electoral regulations, South African
holiday makers, tourists and cricket fans in Europe for the
Cricket World Cup were excluded from casting their ballots.
</P>
<P>
Back home, security personnel on election duty on June 2,
Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) officials, and voters who
will be abroad on the voting day, were also able to cast their
ballots.
</P>
<P>
The polling station at the High Commission in the Australian
capital Canberra was the first to open but officials said only 16
people -- five of them high commission staff -- had voted by 8
p.m. local time, an hour before polling closed, South African
Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The embassy in Beijing, home to a permanent community of only
40 South Africans, saw around a dozen voters by late afternoon,
according to first secretary Izak Human.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 South Africans -- many of them cricket fans on
their way to the World Cup match between South Africa and Kenya in
Amsterdam -- had voted at the embassy in The Hague in The
Netherlands by noon.
</P>
<P>
In London, a small but steady trickle of voters passed through
the halls of South Africa House to cast their ballots, according
to SAPA.
</P>
<P>
The scene was in stark contrast to five years ago when election
officials had their hands full coping with a queue of eager, many
first- time, voters.
</P>
<P>
Once the polling stations closed at 9 p.m., the ballot boxes
would be emptied and the votes placed into special bags and sealed
before being transported back to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
All foreign votes will be counted at a polling station in
central Pretoria, IEC spokeswoman Lydia Young said.
</P>
<P>
Polling stations at the South African embassy in Washington and
the consulate in New York reported a slow start but expected the
pace to pick up around lunch time.
</P>
<P>
The voting at home and abroad was rather smooth with only small
hitches.
</P>
<P>
In Gauteng Province, the presiding officer at the Winchester
Ridge Primary School south of Johannesburg, Liam Clarke, was
hijacked while unloading ballot papers at the school when a gunman
ordered him to hand over his vehicle's keys, SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
Police managed to recover the IEC vehicle, including national
and provincial ballot papers and security stamps, although
declaration certificates, which looked like cheques, were not
recovered.
</P>
<P>
IEC officials said they believed the incident was not
politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
Another IEC vehicle was stolen in the Johannesburg South Area
Wednesday, while two rented vehicles were hijacked on the West
Rand Tuesday. One council vehicle used for electoral purposes was
stolen last week.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's special voting day was specifically for security
force members, but instead IEC officials allowed people like
journalists and pensioners, who were supposed to make arrangements
to vote next week, to cast their votes Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> UK Tightens Sanctions on UNITA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- British Ambassador to Angola
Caroline Helmes Wednesday reiterated that her government is to
tighten its sanctions on the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA), in accordance with the U.N.
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Helmes emphasized that Britain will, together with other U.N.
members, try to make the U.N. sanctions on UNITA more effective,
thus forcing UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi to giver up his war
policy.
</P>
<P>
"Britain supports U.N. stand on the Angola issue and feel sad
over the renewed war in Angola," the ambassador said, adding that
Savimbi should be held responsible for the civil war in the
country, as he has violated the Lusaka Peace Protocol signed in
1994.
</P>
<P>
She said she wishes Angola would achieve peace in the country,
as it is very important to the development in southern Africa,
where Britain has extensive political, diplomatic and economic
interests.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government, in a recent diplomatic offensive, has
demanded the international community strictly observe the U.N.
resolutions on Angola, which include the sanctions on UNITA's
import of oil and arms, and the ban on UNITA leaders trips abroad,
the closure of UNITA offices overseas and its export of diamond.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government has been accusing some European and
African countries, including British companies, of continuing
their secret support to the UNITA, for which the U.N. Security
Council has decided this month to investigate.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Top Police Officer Accused of Embezzlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- A top Ugandan police officer on
forced leave has been accused of diverting police welfare money to
do his own business.
</P>
<P>
Chris Bakiza, director of the country's Criminal Investigation
Department (CID), is said to have diverted the money to his
company which supplies ceremonial uniforms to the force, the New
Vision daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The company, Brevans Enterprises Limited, is run by his wife,
daughter and son, the report added.
</P>
<P>
A witness was quoted as saying that Bakiza had threatened him
with death when he demanded that Bakiza pay back the 19 million
shillings (150,000 U.S. dollars) he lent him to replace the
diverted fund.
</P>
<P>
It was the officer's wife who came to borrow the money because
the officer himself did not want his movements to be monitored by
auditors monitoring him.
</P>
<P>
Bakiza is the second senior police officer charged with using
the force' s money to make personal profits.
</P>
<P>
Former police boss John Odomel faced the same charges last year
and was forced to resign on January 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
The three-man inquiry team responsible for the probe into
Bakiza's case has just been formed by the Ministry of Internal
Affairs.

<HEADLINE> China Speeds Up Credit Guarantee System for Small Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is expected
to speed up its newly developed credit guarantee system for medium-
and small-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Shao Ning, director general of the Enterprise Reform Department
of the State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC), said here today
that this is part of China's efforts to create a comprehensive
support system for the sectors in a bid to boost the economy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the "Top Management Day" hosted by the Swedish
Chamber of Commerce in China, Shao said that the SETC is drawing
up policies to facilitate the development of medium- and small-
sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"Other support systems are also under way in areas such as
technological innovation, training, and information and management
consultancy services," Shao said.
</P>
<P>
China's medium- and small-sized enterprises have low credit
levels in banks and thus find themselves hard pushed to secure
loans or mortgages.
</P>
<P>
The credit guarantee system will provide a strong support to
those enterprises, with contributions from the Ministry of Finance
and local financial sectors.
</P>
<P>
A guarantee fund in this respect started operation in February
in Zhenjiang of east China's Jiangsu province.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-nine small enterprises in Shanghai, China's top
industrial and commercial center, have been granted 60.5 million
yuan of loans as part of the measures the city is taking to
support and promote the sector.

<HEADLINE> Export Drive Killing Uganda's Fish Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's massive catches of the
Nile perch to meet the demand of the export processing factories
is killing the local fishing industry on Lake Victoria, a global
conservation agency has warned.
</P>
<P>
In its recent documentary entitled "Big Fish, Small Fry," the
World Conservation Union said that nearly all the Nile perch
caught goes to the processing factories and on to Europe, Japan
and the United States, the New Vision daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The agency warned that the local lakeside fish processing
industry has collapsed and there are almost no Nile perch for sale
on the local markets on the shores of the lake.
</P>
<P>
It said as thousands of people, especially women, are employed
in the marketing and processing of fish, many families have lost a
major source of income due to the massive fishing.
</P>
<P>
The Nile perch export has not only caused the loss of jobs and
livelihoods, but is also responsible for high levels of
malnutrition, especially among children, the agency further
warned.
</P>
<P>
Many local fish mongers along the shores have been forced to
sell the skeletons from the factories as protein source, which
have come to be ironically referred to as "fillet" in Uganda,
according to the findings of the agency.
</P>
<P>
Unless checked, the massive fishing would result in serious
protein shortage and economic problems. Fish export is one of
Uganda's key foreign exchange earners. The east African country
gets over 1.5 billion shillings (1.1 million U.S. dollars) a week
from fish exports.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican Resistance Movement
(RENAMO), the biggest opposition party of the country, decided to
hold its fourth congress from July 26 to 29.
</P>
<P>
RENAMO President Afonso Dhlakama made the announcement in
Maputo Wednesday at close of the meeting of RENAMO national
committee which was a preparatory for the congress.
</P>
<P>
The Noticias newspaper quoted Dhlakama as saying that the
congress will be the first meeting of the party after peace was
achieved in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Dhlakama will be nominated as the party's
presidential candidate to run for the presidency with current
President Joaquim Chissano who is also the chairman of the ruling
Mozambique Liberation Front Party.
</P>
<P>
At the fourth congress of the RENAMO, the party constitution
and program will be re-written because the old ones had been
adopted in the warring period.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the coming second multi-party election, Dhlakama
noted that his party insists that the election be held this year.
</P>
<P>
But if the parties reach agreement on its postponement, he
said, the general election may be put off until next year.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the activities of illegal militiamen in northern and
central provinces, Dhlakama pointed out that his party loves peace
and comply with the international principles, denying any relation
with these activities.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Team Scales Mt. Qomolangma for Ethnic Games Flame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- A 10-strong Tibetan team early on
Thursday successfully scaled Mount Qomolangma, the world's highest
peak, in an unprecedented bid to gather the flame for a national
ethnic Games.
</P>
<P>
The flame, which is to be used at the Sixth Chinese National
Minorities' Games in Lhasa this August, was lit on the 8848-meter
summit with the help of a hot Tibetan sun.
</P>
<P>
The team launched the ascent at 3:00 a.m. from a 8300 meters
camp, and Benba Zaxi became the fastest Chinese conqueror on
Qomolangma when he set foot on the peak at 8:02 a.m. after four
hours and 47 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The other climbers, including Cering Doje, Rigna, Loze, Akabo,
Gambo, Lhaba, Zaxi Gering and women adventurers Gusang and Gigi,
also reached the summit in the span of one hour, quickest time
ever recorded for a climbing team.
</P>
<P>
Gusang became the first Chinese women to conquer Mt. Qunolangma
twice and Rigna and Gigi the first Chinese couple ever to reach
the peak, according to the team captain Samzu.
</P>
<P>
Today's feat also made Benba Zaxi the joint record holder with
Cering Doje and Rigna for the most successful climber in China
with ten above-8000 meters mountains conquered.

<HEADLINE> China Issues Registration Rules on Adoption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- New registration rules on the
adoption of Chinese children by foreigners and Chinese citizens
have been introduced by China's Ministry of Civil Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners who want to adopt Chinese children must now come to
China themselves to register. If one of a couple can not come, he
or she must provide a written and notarized letter.
</P>
<P>
They also have to provide notarized information on their
background, age, marital status, occupation, property, health and
police record. Their adoption relationship will go into effect
right after the registration.
</P>
<P>
Also the new regulation stops the charging of fees but
encourages adopters to donate funds to orphanages.
</P>
<P>
Chinese people are now allowed, regardless of whether they have
children or not, to adopt more than one orphan. But according to
the new regulation, Chinese citizens who want to adopt children in
every case should register at civil affairs departments.
</P>
<P>
The new rules also provide directions on the adoption of
Chinese children by Chinese citizens living in Hong Kong, Macao
and Taiwan.

BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The charges against China in
Christopher Cox's report are absolutely lies based on fabrication,
said Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao at a press conference
here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said the charges are made for certain political motives and
they are aimed at defaming China, inciting anti-China mood and
undermining Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We urge the U.S. administration to firmly oppose it,
and take effective measures to eliminate its odious influence."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that China has never stolen nuclear technologies
or secrets from any countries, including the United States.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he pointed out that the United States has powerful
spy and intelligence institutes, from which scandals have been
exposed. "These institutes have never stopped espionage in other
countries."
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government is also firmly opposed to any espionage
against China," Zhu stated.
</P>

responsible country, which abides by the U.N. Charter and acts in

CANBERRA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Australia's richest man Kerry
Packer just kept getting richer in 1998, adding a tidy 1.2
billion Australian dollars (792 million U.S. dollars) to his
fortune.
</P>
<P>
The rise of the Australian stock market over the last 12 months
saw the media tycoon expand his total wealth to 4.2 billion U.S.
dollars, according to the Business Review Weekly magazine's Rich
200 list to be released Friday.
</P>
<P>
This translates to 2.1 million U.S. dollars a day.
</P>
<P>
His nearest rival is Westfield shopping center boss, Frank
Lowy, at 1.71 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Packer's performance has largely been based on the strength of
his stake in the listed magazine and television empire, Publishing

CANBERRA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The number of Australian
households with Internet access nearly quadrupled in the past two
years to top one million, a survey revealed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Almost 1.1 million households, nearly 16 percent of the total,
in Australia, had Internet access in 1998 - up from 286,000 in
1996, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said.
</P>
<P>
Households with children were the most likely to have access to
the Internet, along with families earning more than 66,000
Australian dollars (43,560 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In 1998, 45 percent of Australian homes had a computer and
nearly 16 percent had access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Just over 60 percent of Australia's adult population (8.1
million) used a computer and 32 percent (4.2 million) accessed the
Internet in 1998 - mostly from work or home.
</P>
<P>
By international standards, the monthly Internet access cost in
Australia is relative low, totaling 26 U.S. dollars on average per
household user, or about one percent of the per-capita monthly
income.

<HEADLINE> China to Open Wider to Outside World: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 27 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official has
declared that China will open wider to the outside world and make
better utilization of overseas investments with the advent of a
new century.
</P>
<P>
Wu Yi, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and a state
councilor, made the remarks on Wednesday at a national conference
on foreign investment utilization in national economic and
technical development zones, which was convened here between May
24 and 26.
</P>
<P>
Wu told foreign investors and local trade officials in east
China's Zhejiang Province and Shanghai during her inspection there
that China's national policy of reform and opening to the outside
world will not change whatever the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
"With the social and economic development of the country, China
will open wider to the outside world in more fields," she stressed.
</P>
<P>
She urged China's 32 national development zones to strive to
refine their investment environment so as to make better use of
overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
The state councilor noted that China remains a favorable
destination for overseas investors because of its political and
social stability, the improvement of the legal environment, its
sustained, fast and sound economic growth, and broad market
potential and relatively cheaper labor.
</P>
<P>
"It will be wise of overseas investors to increase their
investments in China," Wu remarked.
</P>
<P>
She urged local trade officials in charge of national
development zones to sum up the experiences of development zone
operation over the past 20 years and continue to improve the
investment environment.

BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Direct or indirect incorporation of
Taiwan in the Japanese-U.S. defense cooperation is a violation of
China's sovereignty and an interference in the country's internal
affairs, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said here today at
a press conference.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government and people firmly oppose that," Zhu
said when asked to comment on recent remarks by a former director-
general of the Japanese Defense Agency that if any crisis occurs
in the Taiwan Straits, Japan and the U.S. can jointly act
according to the new Japanese-U.S. defense guildlines.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said the former director-general, disregard of China's
sovereignty and territorial integrity, made the ravings. "We are
indignant about that."
</P>
<P>
This once again discloses the attempts of a tiny group of
people in Japan to meddle in the Taiwan issue and interfere in
China's internal affairs by using the new guidelines, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, and the
Taiwan issue belongs to China's internal affairs.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Business Leader Calls for Fresh ASEAN Capital Flow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian business leader Ajit Singh
has called for making use of ASEAN attractiveness to draw fresh
foreign direct investment (FDI) flows into the region of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
"We have to make ASEAN truly borderless so that investment,
goods and services can flow freely across the region," said Ajit
Singh, director of Petronas of Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
In his keynote address at the opening session of a two-day
business forum of ASEAN Chambers of Commerce and Industry, which
began here Wednesday, Singh said ASEAN has the market of half a
billion people and offers the potential investors good terms and
conditions.
</P>
<P>
In the subcontinent, in Africa and in Latin America, free trade
areas are being pushed with added vigor and determination, noted
Singh, who was also former ASEAN Secretary General, adding that
nearly all of these free trade areas started after ASEAN's AFTA
(ASEAN free trade area).
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need to keep ahead of the race by ensuring that
AFTA stays on course and is completed even before its deadline of
2003, calling for new members such as Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar and
Cambodia to make special efforts to join in and not wait until
2006 or 2008.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that between 1990 and 1995, FDI into ASEAN averaged
14.9 billion U.S. dollars annually, saying that in 1996, it
increased to 28.96 billion dollars, representing about 22.45
percent of all FDI flows into developing countries, among which
only China attracted more FDI than ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
In pre-1997, ASEAN had become the fourth largest trading entity
in the world and a major recipient of FDI flows among the
developing countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that no one has been immune from the Asian
financial crisis which has prolonged since its outbreak in July
1997, and that all of ASEAN nations have been affected to a larger
or lesser degree.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the need for ASEAN to become team players instead
of going it alone and trying to beggar-thy-neighbor in the
process.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN summit in Hanoi, Vietnam, called for the speedier
implementation of AFTA and ASEAN Investment Area and granted
special privileges to ASEAN and non-ASEAN investors investing in
the manufacturing sector between 1999 and 2000 with greater trade
facilitation measures already put in place.

<HEADLINE> Indian Air Force Launches Third Attacks in Kargil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 27 (Xinhua) -- India Thursday launched its third
air strikes in the Kargil sector of Jammu and Kashmir to help
ground forces to thrash out Pakistan-backed infiltrators, official
sources said here.
</P>
<P>
Indian Air Force (IAF) Wednesday carried out two air strikes in
the above-mentioned area, the first air strikes since 1971 when
India and Pakistan went to war.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's attacks focused on "hideouts and logistic stores of
heavily armed Pakistan-backed infiltrators" in high mountainous
ridges.
</P>
<P>
"The strikes have been successful and effective. The targets
consisted of tented accommodation, logistic stores and hideouts of
the infiltrators. All our combat aircraft have returned safely and
without any damage whatsoever," air force and army officials told
newsmen at a special briefing here.
</P>
<P>
IAF in its strikes used Mig-21, Mig-23, Mig-27 and Mirage-2000
combat jets and sophisticated rockets to pulverize the targets at
heights between 16,000 and 18,000 feet in Drass, Kargil and
Batalic sectors of the Kashmir area, defense sources said here.
</P>
<P>
The air strikes would continue. Infiltrators have suffered
"heavy losses", the sources said.

<HEADLINE> Several Thousand Filipinos Rally Against VFA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Several thousand Filipinos rallied
Thursday in front of the Philippine Senate to protest against the
ratification of the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) as the
senators are scheduled to cast their final votes on the disputed
pact.
</P>
<P>
Anti-VFA groups held a vigil in front of the Senate. A group of
running priests with a giant streamers against the VFA held a
brief demonstration in front of the U.S. embassy early Thursday
morning and ran later to the Senate building to join other
protesters.
</P>
<P>
A group of women installed an altar with the image of Virgin
Mary and held a mass in front of the U.S. embassy after setting
American flags on fire.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers and policemen have secured the senate premises while
lawmen have been dispatched to specific assignments today.
</P>
<P>
The VFA, which was signed by Philippines and U.S. officials
last year, would allow the U.S. to resume major ship visits and
large-scale joint war exercises in the Philippines which were
suspended in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, protesters have held almost daily
demonstrations at the Philippine Senate and the U.S. embassy.
</P>
<P>
Critics say the pact would limit the Philippine government's
right to prosecute American soldiers who commit crimes in the
country, promote prostitution, and drag the Philippines into
conflicts with the United States' enemies.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has started a
213-million-U.S. dollar power rehabilitation project to improve
its power generation and distribution, the Zambia Daily Mail
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>

transmission across the country, board chairman of the Zambia
Electricity Supply Corporation, Patrick Nkanza, was quoted as
saying.

Nkanza said that with the impending competition in the energy
sector due to the participation of the private, the project will
help improve the reliability of his corporation as a utility
company.

corporation are ready for the impending privatization of the
company, he said.

hydro stations. The 213 million dollars has been provided by the

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Top Police Officer Accused of Embezzlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- A top Ugandan police officer on
forced leave has been accused of diverting police welfare money to
do his own business.
</P>
<P>
Chris Bakiza, director of the country's Criminal Investigation
Department (CID), is said to have diverted the money to his
company which supplies ceremonial uniforms to the force, the New
Vision daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The company, Brevans Enterprises Limited, is run by his wife,
daughter and son, the report added.
</P>
<P>
A witness was quoted as saying that Bakiza had threatened him
with death when he demanded that Bakiza pay back the 19 million
shillings (150,000 U.S. dollars) he lent him to replace the
diverted fund.
</P>
<P>
It was the officer's wife who came to borrow the money because
the officer himself did not want his movements to be monitored by
auditors monitoring him.
</P>
<P>
Bakiza is the second senior police officer charged with using
the force' s money to make personal profits.
</P>
<P>
Former police boss John Odomel faced the same charges last year
and was forced to resign on January 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
The three-man inquiry team responsible for the probe into
Bakiza's case has just been formed by the Ministry of Internal
Affairs.

<HEADLINE> Expert Suggests Widening Channel for Non-State Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- An expert from the National Bureau
of Statistics today suggested that the Chinese government actively
develop non-state financial institutes to widen the channel for
non-state investment.
</P>
<P>
The investment by the non-state sector witnessed a growth of 8.
6 percent and eight percent in 1997 and 1998 respectively, but
these figures are 0.4 and 11.6 percentage points lower than the
state sector in the same period.
</P>
<P>
The expert blamed the slow development of the non-state
financial institutes, yet in comparison the non-state firms
themselves have enjoyed rapid development in the past years.
</P>
<P>
He recommended that the government should not simply close or
merge those institutes which are involved in illegal operations or
facing a payment crisis, but should guide them to develop while
strengthening supervision of them.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested the government set up national or regional
funds to back the development of small and medium-size non-state
firms.
</P>
<P>
"Large commercial banks should also provide more support in
this area," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that to enliven non-state investment, the government
should also simplify the approval procedure and let investments
flow into more fields.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai To Ban Straw Burning in Fields </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Over the next five years China's
industrial and commercial center Shanghai will try to eliminate
pollution resulting from straw burning by making more use of the
material which is a by-product of various crops.
</P>
<P>
Sources with the Shanghai Municipal Agricultural Commission say
the rural areas of the city produce about three million tons of
straw annually.
</P>
<P>
As fewer farmers use it for lighting fires or as manure, the
greater part of the straw is usually burned in the fields, which
constitutes a major source of pollution while also wasting
potential resources.
</P>
<P>
From this summer the burning of straw will be banned and a
number of factories will be set up to make manure and building
materials out of the product.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's ban on straw burning is only part of China's effort
to do away with related pollution nationwide.
</P>
<P>
In a recent joint effort, six Chinese ministerial departments
have prohibited straw burning along major roads and around
airports to protect the environment and promote safety.
</P>
<P>
People who do so and cause serious air pollution will be
subject to fines, according to a regulation jointly issued by the
State Environmental Protection Administration, the ministries of
agriculture, finance, railways and communications, and the General
Administration of Civil Aviation.
</P>
<P>
China produces more than 600 million tons of crop straw each
year and farmers, especially in economically developed regions
like Shanghai, usually burn it whenever and wherever they like.

<HEADLINE> China's Trains to Run Faster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The speed of trains on the railway
between Hangzhou, capital of east China's Zhejiang Province, and
Zhuzhou, a major city in central China's Hunan Province, will be
increased to 120 km per hour from the present 90 km per hour as of
October 1.
</P>
<P>
The program is part of China's massive efforts to raise the
speed of trains across the country to meet the needs of the
national economy and to sharpen the competitive edge of railways
on the whole transport market.
</P>
<P>
Railway transport in China has been challenged by express
highways and civil aviation in recent years. Statistics show that
train transport volume accounted for only 38.8 percent of the
country's total transportation volume in 1998, compared with 60.5
percent in 1980.
</P>
<P>
China began to improve train speeds on April 1, 1997, and the
average travel speed of the country's trains has since increased
to 54.9 from 48.1 km per hour. On the three major lines from
Beijing to Guangzhou, Shanghai and Harbin, trains now run at 140
km per hour.
</P>
<P>
Sources with the Ministry of Railways say China is now
considering building a high-speed railway linking its capital with
its largest industrial center, Shanghai, in the year 2000, with a
total length of 1,300 km at a designed speed of more than 250 km
per hour.

<P>
NAIROBI, May 27 (Xinhua) -- About 104 people were killed and at
least 2, 000 hospitalized following an outbreak of malaria in
Kisii District, Nyanza Province, Southwestern Kenya.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 3,100 people have been treated for the
fever and discharged since the outbreak began three weeks ago,
Daily Nation newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Local doctors fear death toll could be even higher because
there may be more victims died at home without.
</P>
<P>
Patients' relatives have blamed many deaths on the poor state
of roads destroyed by heavy rains and their inability to transport
victims for proper medical care.
</P>
<P>
Doctors said there was an acute congestion of patients at Kisii
District Hospital which has 242 beds and 565 patients.
</P>
<P>
They said that there were adequate supply of malaria drugs in
the district hospital, but lack of intravenous fluids.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1999 World Health Report released by the World
Health Organization, malaria is a leading killer in Africa. The
disease is said to directly or indirectly kill one out of every
four children in sub-sahara Africa.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Imports From Russia Surge in First 4 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- China's imports from Russia surged
a record 42 percent in the first four months of the year, hitting
1.374 billion U.S. dollars, according to latest statistics from
the General Administration of Customs.
</P>
<P>
Total bilateral trade volume between China and Russia grew 1.7
percent in the period, reaching 1.710 billion U.S. dollars.
Meanwhile, China's exports to Russia plummeted 53 percent compared
with the corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
The increase of imports from Russia was mainly because of a
surge in imports of timber, rolled steel, chemical materials,
aluminum, machinery and electronic products, according to the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC).
</P>
<P>
A trade expert here told Xinhua that the increase of imports
from Russia was due to China's policy of stimulating domestic
demand and the policy to encourage imports since early this year.
</P>
<P>
"The growth of imports from Russia is likely to continue in the
coming several months but the growth rate might slow down," he
said. "As China's imports increased sharply in the first few
months of the year, the market demand for raw materials will be
smaller. In addition, Russia has started to increase export tax,
which will also increase costs for Chinese importers."
</P>
<P>
He attributed the nose-dive of exports to Russia to the
sluggish market demand in that country. Russia's tightened control
of foreign exchange was another factor that led to the decline.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said the norms of trade between China and
Russia need to be refined and China needs to improve the
competitiveness of its export products as well.
</P>
<P>
However, China's exports to Russia in April grew to about the
same level of the corresponding period last year, he noted.

<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Western investors, including those
from the United States, are still enthusiastic about cooperating
closely with China despite the country's severe criticism of the U.
S.-led NATO's attack on the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen Sino-American OCT International Trading Company
Ltd., the first Sino-American foreign trade company that began
operations on May 25, was considered by analysts as proof that the
Chinese market is still attractive.
</P>
<P>
On May 19, business leaders and representatives of 17
influential companies or institutions accepted letters of
invitation from Beijing Mayor Liu Qi to act as his first group of
economic advisors.
</P>
<P>
In a recent speech, Chinese President Jiang Zemin pledged that
China will unswervingly carry out its reform and open-up drive to
help the country become stronger.
</P>
<P>
Increased calls at Chinese ports by foreign vessels and the
growing numbers of overseas tourists visiting China's cities,
coupled with news reports saying foreigners in China are doing
well, has all contributed to the feeling of ongoing good will.
</P>
<P>
At the Tianjin Port's bonded zone one official said, "China's
door has remained open to the outside world."
</P>
<P>
Gary Tooker, Chairman of Motorola Inc. of the United States,
said during a recent business trip to Tianjin that his company
would not change its plan of adding a further 1.5 billion U.S.
dollars of investment to its China operations. The plan was
announced by the company before U.S. President Bill Clinton made
an official visit to China last June. Motorola Company is now the
largest U.S. investor in China.
</P>
<P>
Sven-Christer Nilsson, CEO and President of Ericsson, pledged
in Beijing on May 20 that his company's investment in China would
climb to 600 million U.S. dollars by next year.
</P>
<P>
"As long as China pushes forward its open-up drive, then there
will be no interruption in the flow of direct foreign investment
into the country," said Tasuku Takagaki, Chairman of the Tokyo-

<P>
In the view of foreign investors China has considerable long
term attractions and advantages such as a favorable economic and
political environment and huge internal market potential.
</P>
<P>
The Hoechst Company of Germany claimed in a report issued last
week that Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong will continue to be the
most attractive investment destinations in the fast shifting east.
</P>
<P>
By late 1999, Shanghai alone will pump in investments of 40
billion U.S. dollars into fixed assets and infrastructure, one
third of which will be covered by overseas partners.
</P>
<P>
U.S. automaker Ford Motor Company last week published a
forecast bulletin in which it said China's auto industry will
become one of the world's largest in the next century, with
annual sales amounting to four million cars by 2010, and therefore,
it will continue to cooperate with China in developing environment-
friendly vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Many foreign investors said the cooperative attitude of the
government towards improving the transparency of work,
infrastructure and related services are the most important factors
for them to choose investment destinations.
</P>
<P>
So far, China has become the world's second largest country in
terms of the volume of overseas investment. By late 1998, some 324,
000 overseas-backed enterprises had emerged in China, with
investment exceeding 267.4 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Analysts generally believe that China's efforts to gain
accession to the World Trade Organization, including opening up
such fields as commerce, foreign trade and air transport to
foreign investors, will make it even more attractive to investors.

<HEADLINE> Civil Dispute Mediators Urged to Play Greater Role in Maintaining Stability in China (1) </HEADLINE>

<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Minister of Justice Gao
Changli has called on the country's one million civil dispute
mediators to play a greater role in dissolving the "internal
contradictions of the people" to help maintain social stability.
</P>
<P>
"China faces many difficulties and problems at this crucial
time of reform and development, and the characteristics of the
large number of civil disputes today are quite different from
before," he said at a national conference on mediation work.
</P>
<P>
Known as "the people's mediators," those elected neighborhood
peacemakers are an important part of the country's legal system,
since they prevent hundreds of thousands of quarrels from flaring
up into criminal offenses every year.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the Ministry of Justice, there are
9.175 million members in 985,000 "people's mediators committees"
spread through every corner of society.

"They handled 87,000 civil disputes in 1998, stopped 36,000
armed fights amongst groups and helped to keep another 36,000
groups of complainants from taking to the streets ," the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
And in the past twenty years the people's mediators handled 127.
86 million civil cases, 5.3 times more than the country's courts,
prevented 1.503 million attempted suicides triggered by civil
disputes, and halted 135.8 million quarrels from escalating into
crimes.
</P>
<P>
The minister said, however, that much more needs to be done to
cope with the rising number of conflicts as a result of the
exorbitant burden on farmers, the layoffs from loss-making state-
owned enterprises and irregularities in the relocation of
residents in urban construction.
</P>
<P>
He called on mediation committees across the country to study
the process of how disputes arise and their escalation and
explosion into crises, and to try all means to solve the feuds
before they become too acute.
</P>
<P>
In particular, he encouraged the setup of more hot lines and
mediation centers in neighborhoods and especially in large and
medium-sized state-owned enterprises as part of crisis-control
efforts.
</P>
<P>
In addition to democratic elections, China is also trying to
take steps in hiring lawyers to also serve as pacifiers, according
to the minister.

<HEADLINE> S. Africans Abroad Go to Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 26 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's second
democratic election got underway Wednesday as South Africans
working and studying abroad cast special votes at the country's
foreign missions.
</P>
<P>
However, in terms of electoral regulations, South African
holiday makers, tourists and cricket fans in Europe for the
Cricket World Cup were excluded from casting their ballots.
</P>
<P>
Back home, security personnel on election duty on June 2,
Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) officials, and voters who
will be abroad on the voting day, were also able to cast their
ballots.
</P>
<P>
The polling station at the High Commission in the Australian
capital Canberra was the first to open but officials said only 16
people -- five of them high commission staff -- had voted by 8
p.m. local time, an hour before polling closed, South African
Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The embassy in Beijing, home to a permanent community of only
40 South Africans, saw around a dozen voters by late afternoon,
according to first secretary Izak Human.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 South Africans -- many of them cricket fans on
their way to the World Cup match between South Africa and Kenya in
Amsterdam -- had voted at the embassy in The Hague in The
Netherlands by noon.
</P>
<P>
In London, a small but steady trickle of voters passed through
the halls of South Africa House to cast their ballots, according
to SAPA.
</P>
<P>
The scene was in stark contrast to five years ago when election
officials had their hands full coping with a queue of eager, many
first- time, voters.
</P>
<P>
Once the polling stations closed at 9 p.m., the ballot boxes
would be emptied and the votes placed into special bags and sealed
before being transported back to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
All foreign votes will be counted at a polling station in
central Pretoria, IEC spokeswoman Lydia Young said.
</P>
<P>
Polling stations at the South African embassy in Washington and
the consulate in New York reported a slow start but expected the
pace to pick up around lunch time.
</P>
<P>
The voting at home and abroad was rather smooth with only small
hitches.
</P>
<P>
In Gauteng Province, the presiding officer at the Winchester
Ridge Primary School south of Johannesburg, Liam Clarke, was
hijacked while unloading ballot papers at the school when a gunman
ordered him to hand over his vehicle's keys, SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
Police managed to recover the IEC vehicle, including national
and provincial ballot papers and security stamps, although
declaration certificates, which looked like cheques, were not
recovered.
</P>
<P>
IEC officials said they believed the incident was not
politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
Another IEC vehicle was stolen in the Johannesburg South Area
Wednesday, while two rented vehicles were hijacked on the West
Rand Tuesday. One council vehicle used for electoral purposes was
stolen last week.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's special voting day was specifically for security
force members, but instead IEC officials allowed people like
journalists and pensioners, who were supposed to make arrangements
to vote next week, to cast their votes Wednesday.

BRASILIA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Alex netted two goals as Brazil's
Palmeiras defeated Argentina's River Plate 3-0 in Sao Paulo on
Wednesday night to advance to the Libertadores Cup final on 3-1
aggregate.
</P>
<P>
Alex scored the opening goal in the 17th minute on a feed from
Zinho. Roque Junior gave Palmeiras room to breath in the 19th
minute, heading it past River Plate goalkeeper Bonano.
</P>
<P>
Palmeiras easily dominated the field setting up attack after
attack only to blow it at the last minute, with the ball hitting
the post or being knocked wide by the goalkeeper.
</P>
<P>
All Palmeiras' efforts paid off in the 87th minute when Paulo
Nunes crossed it to Alex, who crossed it back and into the goal
high and to the right.
</P>
<P>
Palmeiras advanced to the final agaist Colombia's Deportivo
Cali, which defeated Paraguay's Cerro Porteno on 6-3 aggregate

<HEADLINE> New Zealand's Imports Keep Rising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's imports have been
rising each month over the past two years, while its exports trend
 flattening in contrast to the rise in imports, pushing the annual
trade deficit to record levels.
</P>
<P>
In a media release, Statistics NZ said Thursday that
provisional merchandise imports for April 1999 were 2.02 billion
NZ dollars (1.1 billion U.S. dollars), 8.2 percent higher than in
the same month of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary estimates of New Zealand's exports for April show
an expected trade deficit of 55 million NZ dollars (30 million
U.S. dollars) for the month and 1.32 billion NZ dollars (726
million U.S. dollars) for the year ending April 1999.
</P>
<P>
During the 1990s, the average trade balance of the country for
the month of April, including April 1999, was a surplus of 175
million NZ dollars (96 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The release cited imports of cars and household goods as major
contributors to the overall import growth.
</P>
<P>
After a quiet period from late 1997 to early 1998, imports of
cars have risen strongly and returned to the level of two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
"The removal of tariffs on imported cars in May 1998 and the
closure of the New Zealand car assembly industry have played a
part in this growth," New Zealand Acting Government Statistician
Dianne Macaskill said.

<HEADLINE> UK Tightens Sanctions on UNITA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- British Ambassador to Angola
Caroline Helmes Wednesday reiterated that her government is to
tighten its sanctions on the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA), in accordance with the U.N.
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Helmes emphasized that Britain will, together with other U.N.
members, try to make the U.N. sanctions on UNITA more effective,
thus forcing UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi to giver up his war
policy.
</P>
<P>
"Britain supports U.N. stand on the Angola issue and feel sad
over the renewed war in Angola," the ambassador said, adding that
Savimbi should be held responsible for the civil war in the
country, as he has violated the Lusaka Peace Protocol signed in
1994.
</P>
<P>
She said she wishes Angola would achieve peace in the country,
as it is very important to the development in southern Africa,
where Britain has extensive political, diplomatic and economic
interests.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government, in a recent diplomatic offensive, has
demanded the international community strictly observe the U.N.
resolutions on Angola, which include the sanctions on UNITA's
import of oil and arms, and the ban on UNITA leaders trips abroad,
the closure of UNITA offices overseas and its export of diamond.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government has been accusing some European and
African countries, including British companies, of continuing
their secret support to the UNITA, for which the U.N. Security
Council has decided this month to investigate.

<HEADLINE> China's Pharmaceutical Industry Expected Better Climate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- China's pharmaceutical industry is
expecting a better climate in the second quarter of this year,
according to a recent survey.
</P>
<P>
Launched by the China Economic Climate Monitoring Center and
the State Economic and Trade Commission, the survey shows that the
indices of employees, raw material prices and products in storage
are going up.
</P>
<P>
The center analyzed that pharmaceutical firms are optimistic
about the sales volume and economic returns in the second quarter.
The survey show that 64 percent of firms surveyed said they expect
a larger sales volume in the April-June period.
</P>
<P>
But because the state's price-adjustment policy will be
published in the second quarter of this year, only four percent of
firms think that medicine prices will go up in the period.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of this year, affected by the expected
medical system reform and the price-adjustment policy, the
pharmaceutical industry suffered a sluggish climate.

<HEADLINE> Civil Dispute Mediators Urged to Play Greater Role in Maintaining Stability in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Minister of Justice Gao
Changli has called on the country's one million civil dispute
mediators to play a greater role in dissolving the "internal
contradictions of the people" to help maintain social stability.
</P>
<P>
"China faces many difficulties and problems at this crucial
time of reform and development, and the characteristics of the
large number of civil disputes today are quite different from
before," he said at a national conference on mediation work.
</P>
<P>
Known as "the people's mediators," those elected neighborhood
peacemakers are an important part of the country's legal system,
since they prevent hundreds of thousands of quarrels from flaring
up into criminal offenses every year.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the Ministry of Justice, there are
9.175 million members in 985,000 "people's mediators committees"
spread through every corner of society.

"They handled 87,000 civil disputes in 1998, stopped 36,000
armed fights amongst groups and helped to keep another 36,000
groups of complainants from taking to the streets ," the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
And in the past twenty years the people's mediators handled 127.
86 million civil cases, 5.3 times more than the country's courts,
prevented 1.503 million attempted suicides triggered by civil
disputes, and halted 135.8 million quarrels from escalating into
crimes.
</P>
<P>
The minister said, however, that much more needs to be done to
cope with the rising number of conflicts as a result of the
exorbitant burden on farmers, the layoffs from loss-making state-
owned enterprises and irregularities in the relocation of
residents in urban construction.
</P>
<P>
He called on mediation committees across the country to study
the process of how disputes arise and their escalation and
explosion into crises, and to try all means to solve the feuds
before they become too acute.
</P>
<P>
In particular, he encouraged the setup of more hot lines and
mediation centers in neighborhoods and especially in large and
medium-sized state-owned enterprises as part of crisis-control
efforts.
</P>
<P>
In addition to democratic elections, China is also trying to
take steps in hiring lawyers to also serve as pacifiers, according
to the minister.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Holds Meeting on Parliamentary Committee System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- A conference on parliamentary
committee systems, organized by the Institute of Parliamentary
Studies of the Bangladesh Parliament, started here Thursday
morning.
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference, focusing on issues related to the
parliamentary committee system in Bangladesh, will cover such
issues as oversight of the government, the role of women within
the committees, the role of the committee chairpersons, and the
role of the committees in budget procedures.
</P>
<P>
"The social system of Bangladesh has provisions for rule of
law, parliamentary democracy and accountable government," said
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who is also leader of parliament,
while inaugurating the conference.
</P>
<P>
The closing ceremony will be addressed by Khaleda Zia, leader
of the opposition in parliament.
</P>
<P>
"Committees are essential tools" which "provide a forum where
debates can take place on the basis of rationale rather than
passion... with less space for demagogy... more chances for
reaching consensus," Hasina said.
</P>
<P>
She said that a number of improvements were initiated in recent
years through amendments to the Rules of Procedure, such as
reconstituting the standing committees on ministries to make
non-minister members of parliament to head the committees,
introducing prime minister's question time to make the executive
branch of government more accountable to parliament, and deciding
to refer all bills introduced in the parliament by the government
to standing committees for examination and scrutinization before
enactment.
</P>
<P>
"Parliament is the center of all activities. We believe all
national problems could be solved through discussion in the
parliament," she said.
</P>
<P>
Speakers from India and Britain will present papers at the
conference about the committee systems of parliament in their
respective countries, and an international parliamentary expert
from the United Nations Development Program will deliver a speech
on the comparative constitutional law.
</P>
<P>
Some 400 people, including ministers and members of parliament,
are participating in the conference, which is targeted at members
and senior officials of the Secretariat of the Bangladesh
Parliament.

JAKARTA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian disappointment at the

semifinals of the World Championships.
</P>
<P>
"A few months ago, our men's doubles were still able to win,
but now we seem to be powerless. Our men's singles can still
maintain the balance with the world, but we are painfully lagging
behind in the women's singles," Christian was quoted by The
Indonesian Observer Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said PBSI must pick up the pace to come up with the
achievement made by other countries' players by seeking remedies
to weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
"Coaching must be intensely heeded. We'll call in experts in
skills-upgrading, psychologists and body trainers. In short we
shall adopt technology and science," Christian said.
</P>
<P>
He was opposed to a suggestion that some of the coaches at the
training center be replaced. He agreed, though, they should
upgrade their coaching skills.
</P>
<P>
"Don't be short-sighted in viewing the matter. They may have
failed in Denmark, but they still deserve praise for what they did
in the previous events such as in the Asian Games and All England.
The existing coaches can still be relied on. Don't rush ourselves
to a hasty judgement. What is left to do is evaluation," he added.
</P>
<P>
Referring specifically to the Copenhagen disaster, Christian
admitted to having slipped up and was likely to have applied the
wrong strategy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, former world champion Icuk Sugiarto voiced criticism
that the PBSI training program had looked like going nowhere while
rivalry has now become stiff.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign line-ups are now the names to beat and this needs
research and should give us motivation," said Icuk, who won the
men's singles trophy in 1983.
</P>
<P>
He questioned the loose monitoring of the coaches by the
federation, saying that the players -- now at the training center -
- are no longer national class but are already world class, which
subsequently needs good quality mentors.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Tennis Body to Delay SEA Games Training Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Tennis Association
(Pelti) will delay its training program for the 20th Southeast
Asian (SEA) Games until July, The Jakarta Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Pelti spokesman Benny Mailili said that Pelti had decided in a
meeting held on Tuesday night to delay the training program until
after national selections from June 23 to June 26. Pelti will
select eight of 19 players to take part in the Games.
</P>
<P>
"We won't have a selection for doubles players. The players
will then take part in the SEA Games training program starting in
July," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Benny said veteran players, including Andrian Raturandang and
men's doubles specialist Sulistyo Wibowo, would be given the
chance to compete in the selection process.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's top player Wynne Prakusya has already earned a
place in the Games due to her World Tennis Association ranking of
190.
</P>
<P>
Benny said currently all players were free to train with their
favorite coaches. But after they join the Pelti training program,
two coaches will train the men's squad and two will coach the
women's, with a head coach supervising the entire training.
</P>
<P>
"Coaching nominees must understand sports science. They will
have to present their ideas in a meeting during the one-month
training program. The officials at the meeting will decide on the
most feasible ideas," he added.

<HEADLINE> Oracle Seminar Helps HK Firms Maximize E-Business Opportunities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong leg of iDevelop'99
sponsored by leading software company Oracle Corporation opened
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two-day iDevelop'99 comprises of conferences, seminars and
hands-on development sessions for local Internet developers and
software companies.
</P>
<P>
The largest of its kind in Hong Kong, the event aims to provide
participants with the latest technologies, tools and support
initiatives to develop applications for e-business.
</P>
<P>
"To maximize the opportunities that the Internet provides,
developers need new tools and a new way of developing and
deploying applications," said Mark Jarvis, Oracle's senior vice
president of worldwide marketing.
</P>
<P>
"iDevelop'99 aims to introduce developers to Oracle's Internet
computing platform so that they can build e-business applications
that take full advantage of the immense business opportunities on
the Web," said Jarvis.
</P>
<P>
According to Jarvis, the Internet technology of Oracle, the
world's leading supplier of information management software with
annual revenues of over 8.3 billion U.S. dollars, has helped the
success of e-business sites such as Amazon.com, Yahoo!, and eXite.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1998 Collaborative Marketing Survey, nearly 70
percent of the world's top e-business sites use Oracle's database,
tools and application products.
</P>
<P>
"As Hong Kong strives to become the leading city in Asia for e-
business, it is critical that we develop our expertise in building
applications that take full advantage of the Internet," said Arics
Poon, Oracle's Hong Kong manager.
</P>
<P>
"By building new Internet applications, local developers and
software companies can strengthen Hong Kong's position as a world-
class, competitive service center," Poon said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Okays Proposed Annual Development Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
approved a 155 billion taka (3.2 billion U.S. dollars) annual
development program (ADP) for July 1999-June 2000 fiscal year to
further spur the economy, press reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This approval was made at a meeting of the National Economic
Council Wednesday with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in the chair.
The size of the revised ADP for the outgoing fiscal year is 140
billion taka (2.89 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
In the ADP outlay, local currency will amount to 88.3 billion
taka (1.82 billion dollars) or 57 percent of the total, while the
project aid will be 64.26 billion taka (1.32 billion dollars) and
food aid 2.44 billion taka (50.3 million dollars), Press Secretary
to the prime minister Jawadul Karim was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China Is Biggest Source for HK's Long Term Growth: TDC Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The biggest potential source of
growth for Hong Kong in the longer term is its special connection
to China's mainland, Victor Fung, chairman of the Hong Kong Trade
Development Council (TDC), said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Delivering the opening remarks for the Financial Conference on
Asia '99, Fung said that China's likely entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO) by the end of this year is good news for Hong
Kong's business community.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts believe China's accession to the WTO will be the
beginning of the end of Hong Kong's traditional role as gateway to
China.
</P>
<P>
"I believe exactly the opposite," Fung said.
</P>
<P>
China's joining the WTO will mean improved access to mainland
markets, increased trade between China and the developed economies,
increased transparency in trade regulations, closer integration
and co-operation on trade and tariff negotiations, and further
liberalization of the mainland's services sectors.
</P>
<P>
As the premier gateway for trade and investment to and from
China's mainland, anything that increases these flows will help
Hong Kong, Fung said.
</P>
<P>
The argument that more companies will deal directly with
China's mainland is true, but the increase in trade will be so
much, that the entire pie will increase, not just the portion of
trade going directly to the mainland, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is fast becoming the expertise and funding center for
efforts to modernize the Chinese mainland economy.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises on the mainland need financing and professional
expertise to turn their operations around the modernization, Fung
said. That's where Hong Kong comes in, he added.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises on the mainland continue to come to Hong Kong to
list on the stock exchange and raise money for activities on the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
And more than 100,000 Hong Kong people are working in the
Chinese mainland, many of them in highly-skilled management
positions offering expertise in accounting, project financing,
design, advertising and legal services.
</P>
<P>
Offering expertise and funding for economic restructuring will
be central to the role Hong Kong will play in helping China's
modernization drive, Fung said.
</P>
<P>
Also by being so deeply involved in this effort, Hong Kong will
further integrate with the mainland economy and inevitably be in a
position to influence other major challenges facing China's
mainland, Fung said.
</P>
<P>
This key role in the economic future of China's mainland, plus
Hong Kong's own growing role as an offshore trade hub and a center
for multinational corporations business activity, are three major
areas of growth that help ensure a bright future for Hong Kong,
Fung noted.
</P>
<P>
A number of signs have started appearing on the horizon that
indicate that the economic downturn in Hong Kong may have bottomed
out and that recovery is beginning, Fung said.
</P>
<P>
First of all, the Hang Seng Index has rebounded from a low of
about 6,500 points last August and has effectively doubled in the
last 9 months.
</P>
<P>
Property sales resumed again last month, after a moratorium of
9 months. Initial reaction has been very positive.
</P>
<P>
GDP growth is expected to pick up dramatically towards the end
of the year. The Hong Kong government estimates that GDP growth
for 1999 will be about 0.5 percent, Hongkong Bank is forecasting
about -1 percent, and a recent survey of economists quoted by the
Asian Wall Street Journal has growth at about -1.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
All of these figures mean that during the last quarter and
possibly two quarters, growth will be back in the black and Hong
Kong on its way out of recession, Fung said.
</P>
<P>
Tourism figures are rebounding. About 100,000 more visitors
came to Hong Kong last month than in February.
</P>
<P>
One of the most potent signs of recovery is the results of
recent trade fairs organized by the Hong Kong Trade Development
Council.
</P>
<P>
TDC's last four fairs -- Fashion Week, the Toy Fair, the
Jewelry Fair and at the Gift and Housewares Fair -- all showed a
significant increase in the number of exhibitors and overseas
buyers coming to Hong Kong to do business.
</P>
<P>
On top of all this, in recent polls Hong Kong people have said
they feel much more confident about the economy in 1999 than last
year, Fung said.
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference is organized by the TDC with a theme of
"Asian Finance: Turmoil, Regulations and Recovery." Speakers
include financial and banking officials, specialists, professors
from Hong Kong, China's mainland and other Asian countries.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: HK's Tourism Industry Moves Towards Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 27 (Xinhua) -- After a year and a half of
recession, Hong Kong's tourism industry, one of the worst sectors
hit by the Asian financial crisis, is beginning to show signs of
recovery.
</P>
<P>
During the first four months of this year, Hong Kong hosted a
total of 3.4 million visitors from all over the world, who were
equivalent to half of its population and represented a 13 percent
increase from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The sustained growth of the number of visitors to Hong Kong has
continued for 10 consecutive months since last July, which
contrasted sharply with the severe declines of 11 percent in the
year-on-year number of visitors in 1997 and 8 percent in 1998 due
to the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a total of 89 hotels throughout Hong Kong
were busier in the first four months this year than that of last
year with their average room occupancy rate ranging between 74
percent and 81 percent.
</P>
<P>
As Stephen Ip, secretary for Economic Services, has said: "this
is particularly encouraging when most of our major neighboring
competitors are still suffering from a downturn in visitor
arrivals."
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's tourism industry is one of the important pillars in
its economy. It generated a total of 72.6 billion HK dollars (9.31
billion U.S. dollars) last year in gross business receipts,
contributing 5 percent to GDP.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the tourism industry maintained its role as a
major employer, creating jobs for some 330,000 people, or about 10
percent of the Hong Kong labor force in the year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the continued recovery in visitor arrivals
and hotel occupancy mainly to the tremendous efforts the
government and all sectors of the tourism industry have made to
keep Hong Kong competitive.
</P>
<P>
The government is pursuing a series of important measures to
strengthen Hong Kong's position as a leading travel and tourist
destination in Asia.
</P>
<P>
It has put in place a three-pronged strategy to sustain the
long-term development of tourism by promoting Hong Kong to
overseas tourists, enhancing its attractiveness as well as
facilitating the entry of visitors into Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Tourist Association also gears up its efforts to
highlight the city's diversity and its unique international
metropolis blending East with West by launching various colorful
activities such as a worldwide New Destination Campaign entitled "
We are Hong Kong - City of Life" and a "Discover Hong Kong"
initiative.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Hong Kong's geographical proximity to and its intimate
connection with vast fast developing mainland market add unique
strength to it.
</P>
<P>
The central government reached an agreement with the government
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region earlier last year
that starting from last July, the quota of mainland visitors to
Hong Kong would rise from 1,142 to 1,500 everyday.
</P>
<P>
The mainland's favorable outbound policies and a shorter visa
processing time keep the steady growth of the number of visitors
to Hong Kong. Only in February this year, travelers from the
mainland to Hong Kong rose by 65.2 percent over the same month
last year.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Hong Kong has a liberal visa regime which enables
visitors from over 170 countries and regions to enter Hong Kong
visa-free.
</P>
<P>
Continuing economic improvement in some Asian countries such as
Indonesia and south Korea was another factor for increasing number
of arrivals to Hong Kong. Visitors from Indonesia in April this
year rose by 83.4 percent, showing the strongest growth in Asian
markets.
</P>
<P>
How does Hong Kong continue to maintain the momentum of growth
in tourism industry?
</P>
<P>
A grand tourism promotion blueprint has been formulated by the
government, which includes the plans to build up attractions such
as a cable car system on Lantau, an international wetland park
near the world-famous Mai Po Marshes, and a fisherman's wharf in
Aberdeen.
</P>
<P>
It is noticeable that there are the negotiations with Walt
Disney over a possible theme park.
</P>
<P>
Apart from working on improving its hardware, Hong Kong is also
mindful of developing its software, including the promotion of new
tourist products and facilities as well as attractive
international events.
</P>
<P>
About 100 interactive computer information kiosks have been
installed at major tourist spots where tourist information can be
obtained easily.
</P>
<P>
The government has also set up a 100-million-HK-dollar (12.82
million U.S. dollar) International Events Fund to support the
staging of some 50 international events in Hong Kong over the next
five years.
</P>
<P>
It is also planning for a world-class, state-of-the-art new
performance venue at West Kowloon Reclamation.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the government will continue to take measures to
facilitate the immigration clearance of visitors to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
All of these will surely bring a bright future to Hong Kong's
tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Local Analysts said with certainty that so long as the
government's plans are implemented step by step, Hong Kong's
travel and tourism industry will continue to revive.
</P>
<P>
They predicted a 3.5 percent growth in visitor arrivals this
year.

<HEADLINE> A Comment on Cox Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The specter of McCarthyism looms
large in the Cox report drawn up by a U.S. House committee led by
Republican Representative Christopher Cox on the so-called China's
"theft" of U.S. nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
While alleging China in the past decades has made "widespread
effort to obtain U.S. military technology by any means, legal or
illegal," the report contains no legally tenable evidence but
instead many vague terms such as "may" and "likely" to back up its
accusations.
</P>
<P>
The malign slanders heaped on China and the term of "China
threat" trumpeted by the report have proved nothing other than the
ulterior motives of a handful of U.S. congressmen who, eager in
slinging mud at China, appear to be reliving the witch-hunt years
of the notorious McCarthyism nearly half a century ago.
</P>
<P>
Cox and his like, using the same base and shabby methods as
those used by Joseph McCarthy in the 1950s, have managed to plunge
every overseas Chinese in the United States into a state of
extreme nervousness and insecurity.
</P>
<P>
As is well-known, China's military technologies are the result
of hard work and wisdom of its own scientists and engineers under
the policy of "independence and self-reliance" firmly pursued by
the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
Long before Beijing and Washington established diplomatic
relations in 1979, China had successfully developed the H-bomb, A-
bomb and satellites. The wisdom of Chinese scientists is self-
evident.
</P>
<P>
The Cox report, in its arrogance to underestimate the wisdom
and creativity of Chinese scientists, constitutes a serious insult
to the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
China has always abided by the U.N. Charter and the norm
governing international relations and sought for peaceful
coexistence with all countries in the world, including the United
States.
</P>
<P>
China has never engaged in nuclear arms race and has announced
it will never be the first to use nuclear weapons. Its possession
of a limited amount of nuclear weapons is solely meant for self-
defense.
</P>
<P>
From whatever perspective -- technological, moral or political,
China sees no need to "steal" military high-tech, or anything
indeed, from the United States, or any other country.
</P>
<P>
Just as Chinese Prime Minister Zhu Rongji pointed out, "China's
theft" is like a tale of the "Arabian Nights."
</P>
<P>
The cooking-up of Cox's report is no accidental.
</P>
<P>
There are some people in the United States who are always
hostile and prejudiced against China. Disregarding the trend of
history, they would never let go the Cold War mentality.
</P>
<P>
They spread rumors and look every nook and cranny for anything
that might be useful in their fabrication of the "China threat" to
undermine the friendship between the Chinese and U.S. peoples. The
Cox report is just one of the latest examples.
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, the U.S.-led NATO mounted a missile attack on the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, which has been condemned in the
strongest term by the Chinese government and people, as well as
the international community.
</P>
<P>
Turning a deaf ear to all calls for a thorough investigation
into the attack, the U.S. Congress, instead, concocted the Cox
report, in a full betrayal of the vicious intentions and political
plot of certain U.S. politicians to fan up anti-China sentiments
and divert attention from the embassy raid.
</P>
<P>
Reflecting on history can bring the present into focus. Just
like the short-lived McCarthyist persecution, the conducts of Cox
and his like, which will undermine the fundamental interests of
the United States and runs counter to the wish of the American
people to develop friendly ties with China, will eventually be
rejected with scorn.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Seeks Ways to Increase Intra-ASEAN Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is exploring ways to
increase intra-ASEAN trade, looking into the use of ASEAN
currencies in conducting trade among ASEAN members as well as for
greater use of products produced locally within the region, said
Myanmar leader Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt.
</P>

Khin Nyunt, who is First Secretary of the Myanmar State Peace

a two-day business forum of Chambers of Commerce and Industry of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) which began
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
No nation in the region has escaped the effects of the economic

said, describing the crisis as "an unprecedented challenge" to the
Southeast Asian region.

He said that the signs of recovery have already emerged, saying
that Myanmar is fully confident that the region will regain the
dynamism in the very near future.
</P>
<P>
Dealing with internal issue, Khin Nyunt said with the
introduction of political, economic and administrative reforms
following the taking over of power by the present government in
1988, Myanmar is now on the path to progress and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment, the government may be in the form of a military
government, but it is an administration which is laying down the
foundation for the establishment of a democratic system that is in
keeping with the conditions of the country as well as the
aspirations of the entire people," he stated.
</P>
<P>
"Once the constitutional process is concluded, a constitutional
government will lead the nation," he added.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's GDP Growth Rate Estimated at 5.2 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's growth rate in the gross
domestic product (GDP) during the outgoing July 1998-June 1999
fiscal year has been estimated at 5.2 percent, The Financial
Express daily newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The higher growth rate has been possible because of bumper
crop production this year," State Minister for Planning Mohiuddin
Khan Alamgir was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Timely steps to recover losses caused by the last year's
devastating floods had also contributed to achieve such a high
growth rate, Khan said.
</P>
<P>
The considerable growth could be achieved due to all-out
efforts of the government and excellent flood management,
according to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.
</P>
<P>
"People of all strata worked hard to tide over the situation,"
she said, adding that timely supply of seeds, fertilizer and other
supports provided to the farmers resulted in the bumper harvest of
crops.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate was earlier projected at only 3.8 percent
against the original target of six percent, as the floods, the
worst in a century, caused a huge damage worth 2 billion U.S.
dollars on the economy.

<P>
It is well-known that the state and national sovereignty have
taken shape gradually in the past thousands of years of human
history.
</P>
<P>
Equality of state sovereignty, mutual recognition and respect
of sovereignty and non-interference in internal affairs are the
most important principles in regard to international relations.
All these have formed the basis of international order and the
foundation for the establishment and existence of the United
Nations. All these are important accomplishments scored by mankind
in contemporary civilization.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Charter, which was formulated in 1945, explicitly
states that all states enjoy equal sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning
Friendly Relations and Cooperation Among States In Accordance with
the Charter of the United Nations, which was ratified in 1970,
reiterates the principle of "equality of sovereignty for all
states."
</P>
<P>
The Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, a document
passed in 1974, restates the basic principles of "state
sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence,"
and "equality of sovereignty for all states." Besides, it also
defines the "economic sovereignty" for states.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the human rights issue, the UN. General Assembly
adopted the Declaration of Non-interference and Nonintervention in
Others' Internal Affairs in 1981. The Declaration states that all
countries are obliged to avoid making use of and distorting human
right issues as a means of imposing pressure upon other countries
or creating suspicion and confusion in other countries or inside a
group of countries or among one another.

In addition, the theory says that with the globalization of the
world economy, the concept for national sovereignty will gradually
be replaced by "global common values" and "the sense of world as a
whole." The notion of national sovereignty has become increasingly
"a reactionary factor" that will fundamentally lead to subjugation,
oppression and war.
</P>
<P>
According to this logic, a "global citizen society" should be
established through "global democratization" to take the place of
the current international relations mechanism based on national
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO, ignoring the United Nations, launched air
strikes against Yugoslavia under the pretext of "preventing
humanitarian disasters." In the meantime, they have declared that
with the advent of a new century, the international community
should alter the traditional notion of national sovereignty and
the norms of international relations, and must put restrictions on
the important aspects of the principle of non-interference in
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
They also declare that "national sovereignty is not so
important as human rights," and that "we have an obligation to
protect human rights worldwide."

<HEADLINE> Defense Ministers of Germany, France, Poland Discuss Kosovo Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- German Defense Minister Rudolf
Scharping said Wednesday that NATO should maintain heavy military
pressure on Belgrade while continue to seek a political solution
to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Scharping, who had a day-long meeting with his French
counterpart Alai Richard and Polish counterpart Janusz
Onyszkiewicz in Rheinland-Pfalz state Wednesday, said only through
maintaining military pressure can a permanent solution be achieved.
</P>
<P>
However, he believed NATO should also continue to seek a
political solution and offer humanitarian aid to Kosovo refugees.
The most important objective is to achieve NATO's goals, Scharping
said.
</P>
<P>
French Defense Minister Alai Richard said that NATO's air raids
against Yugoslavia have made progress since one-third of
Yugoslavia's armed forces in Kosovo have been destroyed and the
main roads to Kosovo have been bombed out.
</P>
<P>
The French minister wanted NATO's air strikes to continue until
Yugoslavia accepts NATO's demands.
</P>
<P>
The three defense ministers also discussed security and defense
cooperation in Europe. Their meeting was held within the framework
of the Weimar three-nation meeting.
</P>
<P>
In August 1991, foreign ministers of Germany, France and Poland
issued a statement in Weimar vowing to strengthen their countries'
good neighborly cooperation. The cooperation extended to security
and defense in 1994.

What deserves more attention is that the United States, not yet
sated with its Cold War achievements, seeks to gain more advances
through military means. Therefore, there has appeared an even
closer growing link between the new Cold War and "hot war."
</P>
<P>
The military interference by the United States in Iraq, Somalia,
Haiti, and Bosnia-Herzegovina, the bombing against the Sudan and
Afghanistan, especially the ongoing air strikes against Yugoslavia,
serve as prominent examples.
</P>
<P>
However, it is also wrong to assume that the new Cold War
launched by the United States, the essence of which is trying
other countries on charges of depriving people of their human
rights, is aimed at protecting human rights in those countries.
</P>
<P>
It is needless to describe the human rights situation in the
United States, as the human rights record by the U.S.-led NATO in
Yugoslavia is enough to shock people across the world.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two months, NATO's rampant bombing has made
hundreds of thousands of people homeless, and devastated countless
houses, hospitals, schools, bridges and railways.

The Chinese people have long been familiar with this kind of
logic and sermonizing.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 years ago, when the imperialist powers entered
China with their advanced weapons and committed all kinds of
crimes, forcing the then weak and poor China to sign unequal
treaties and taking their shares of the Chinese territory and
possessions, they provided the pretext of "spreading Western
civilization" or helping establish "a paradise under benevolent
governments" in China.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, while wantonly bombing the small and weak Yugoslavia,
the NATO member states are repeating the warlike tones of their
predecessors. The words and deeds of the hegemonists headed by the
United States are no more than updated versions of those advocated
by the old imperialists that aggression is reasonable and
meritorious, which represent power politics, the gunboat policy
and the logic of a thief.
</P>
<P>
However, the hegemonists today are much smarter than the
earlier ones. While inheriting the mantle of the old imperialists,
they are advocating a "new theory of interference" with some new
characteristics. They are no longer "fighting for land" because
the traditional gunboat policy of grabbing and sharing land has
become both unworkable and not worthwhile. In today's world, the
benefits of establishing an international political and economic
order conforming to the interests of the Western countries far
outweighs that of grabbing land because there are more choices and
more advanced ways of making a fortune.

<P>
An important mission for the United States to push forward "
global democratization" is to spread its own social system and
values worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The reason the United States labels some countries as "rogue
states" is not because these countries violate the norms of
international relations but because they are not obedient to the
United States, or do not accept U.S.-model and dare say "No" to U.
S. hegemony.
</P>
<P>
The essential reason for the U.S.-led NATO to put Yugoslavia on
the black list of "rogue states" and target it for air strikes,
according to the western media, is that the country is "the last
red fort in Europe." The ultimate mission of the ongoing military
operation, henceforth, is to overthrow the "communist regime led
by Milosevic
</P>
<P>
But unlike the old Cold War, the new Cold War, launched by the
United States under the banner of "safeguarding human rights" and
"global democratization" at a time when it is lording it over the
world, is more hegemonic and smells stronger of gunpowder.
</P>
<P>
The initiators of the new Cold War, no longer satisfied with
the general ideological struggle and infiltration or peaceful
evolution, now brazenly interfere in other countries' internal
affairs, trample on their national sovereignty, and seek to impose
their own standard of human rights and values and decided whether
other countries should be granted a "well-behaved ID card" or be
put on the "black list."
</P>
<P>
The United States seeks to be the world's "human rights judge"
and to try the broad developing and socialist countries on their
human rights. It issues annual human rights reports, judging other
countries' human rights, and lodges suits against those countries,
with which it is dissatisfied, at the U.N. Human Rights
Commission's meetings.

More astonishingly, the United States even pays no regard to
international laws and in an act of madness attacked the Chinese
embassy in Yugoslavia, despite the fact that China is a country
that has consistently advocated a peaceful settlement of the
Kosovo issue and does not participate in the "unofficial" war
being waged.
</P>
<P>
This bloody fact, which killed three people, wounded over
twenty and damaged the embassy premises, fully exposes the vicious
motives of the United States who chant human rights and
humanitarianism as their creed.
</P>
<P>
According to the logic of the United States, interfering in the
internal affairs of those "undemocratic" and "barbarian" countries
and punishing the governments and peoples of those countries is
reasonable and legalized, now that state sovereignty is "outdated"
and "reactionary" and global democratization becomes the
incarnation of "justice".
</P>
<P>
As far as the United States and some Western countries are
concerned, those so-called "barbarian countries" are not qualified
to have their own sovereignty and internal affairs, and thus the
intrusion into and bombing of those countries, even the slaughter
of their peoples, are not deemed as intrusion, because "we are
fighting for the idea of values, not for land", and "we are
fighting for global democratization."

It is clear that the U.S.-style "global democratization,"
which flaunts that "human rights outweigh sovereignty," is in open
contempt of and a challenge to the UN Charter and all generally
recognized norms of international relations.
</P>
<P>
It is entirely wrong to think that the United States and its
partners, in advocating the "global democratization," are denying
the state sovereignty of their own, and aim to build up a more
fair, democratic and more humanitarian international order through
democratic consultations.
</P>
<P>
What they deny is the sovereignty of the vast majority of
developing countries, for, in their view, it is the sovereignty of
these "ignorant" and "backward" nations, as the United States and
its partners term them, has held back the development of democracy,
freedom and human rights.
</P>
<P>
The sovereignty of the United States and its allies, on the
contrary, is the guarantee of democracy, liberty and human rights
and is the basis for the establishment of a U.S.-pattern global
society with common global value and concepts, they claimed. And
the latter style sovereignty should not be denied but be fortified,
expanded, and even spread to other countries.
</P>
<P>
The "New Concept" and "New Function" of NATO to shift from
defense to assault, expand its "defensive" sphere from within the
member states to places outside of its circle of authority and to
act as human right police in the world are but a demonstration of
such an ideology.

But the one thing the new hegemonists and old imperialists
share in common, that is, they would launch merciless forces upon
those "ignorant" and "stubborn" countries and people if they do
not obey or refuse to accept their preaching.
</P>
<P>
In one word, "Might is Right" is the real nature of the
American-style "global democratization", which is basically
covering up the U.S. hegemonism.
</P>
<P>
But the American hegemonists should be reminded of one point:
no matter how powerful you are, the wheel of the history cannot be
reversed. Those who engage in unjust undertakings are doomed to
bring ruin to themselves.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Urban Poor Consortium (UPC), an
Indonesian non-governmental organization, has demanded that the
Election Supervisory Committee, Attorney General's Office and
Indonesian Police follow up its findings on money politics.
</P>
<P>
Coordinator of UPC Wardah Hafidz made fresh allegations on
Wednesday that ruling Golkar Party and the People's Sovereignty
Party (PDR) misused state facilities, the social safety net fund
and small-scale credit funds.
</P>
<P>
The PDR is known to have close ties with Minister of
Cooperatives and Small Enterprises Adi Sasono.
</P>
<P>
"Golkar and PDR need to be disqualified as contestants in the
June 7 general election for their involvement in money politics,"
Wardah said.
</P>
<P>
According to Wardah, her group's findings on money politics as
practiced by the two parties were reported by field workers from
various areas.
</P>
<P>
The general pattern being used by the two parties includes the
use of the social safety net program funds and farming credits,
she said.
</P>
<P>
"In most of the cases we discovered, farmers were given loans
by cooperatives, but for the payoff they had to become members of
PDR," Wardah was quoted by The Jakarta Post Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
She said there was a case where Golkar officials promised
ginger farmers in Sukabumi, West Java, they would not have to
repay their loans if Golkar won the elections in their area.
However, if Golkar lost, they were told they would have to repay
the loans.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile deputy chairman of the Elections Supervisory
Committee Mulyana W. Kusumah said his office would soon discuss
reports of alleged money politics by PDR and Golkar.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Observer quoted some sources as saying that
Golkar officially has at least 11 billion rupiah (1.24 million
U.S. dollars) spread across several bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
In an address to a seminar here on Wednesday, Emil Salim, one
of the country's most respected statesmen, warned that the
credibility of June general election is facing a "real threat"
from money politics.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the University Network for a Free and Fair Election
(Unfrel) Wednesday said most of the violations that occurred
during the enrollment of voters for the general election were
conducted by Golkar Party.
</P>
<P>
They said the violations were found mainly in rural and remote
areas.
</P>
<P>
The organization also reported an alleged violation of election
rules by the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle. The party
held an illegal campaign by mobilizing people during the night.
</P>
<P>
Unfrel Coordinator Agung Supriyo said his organization urged
the Election Supervisory Committee to penalize parties that breach
the election law.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, leaders of Golkar's Jakarta chapter
said they would protest if the Jakarta Elections Supervisory
Committee decided to disqualify the chapter from the remainder of
the campaign period for reported campaign violations.

central bank, has promulgated new management procedures for bank
loans to rural credit cooperatives.

<HEADLINE> Economic Crime in Czech on Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The number of economic crimes in the
Czech Republic in 1998 hit 36,000 cases, up 5,875 cases or 19.5
percent over 1997, said a report published by the Czech Ministry
of the Interior on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from a report titled: "Czech National Secure Status
in 1998," showed that financial losses resulting from economic
crimes in 1998 amounted to 21 billion koruna (600 million US.
dollars ), an increase of 21.6 percent over 1997.
</P>
<P>
The number of economic crimes increased 95.5 percent and the
losses caused by such crime leaped sharply to 398 percent,
compared to figures in 1993, the report added.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference on Tuesday, officials from the ministry
of the interior admitted that economic crime is a serious problem
facing the country, and pledged to adopt more iron-handed anti-
crime measures.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts say the absence of laws and principles, and the
lack of enforcement in the execution of the laws, are a few of the
main reasons causing an increase in economic crimes.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Child Malnutrition Rate Still High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Malnutrition among Vietnamese
children under five was recorded at 39 percent in 1998, Vietnam's
English daily Vietnam News reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's northern central area had the highest malnutrition
rate with 47 percent, Central Highlands with 42 percent while the
lowest rate was recorded in the Southeastern provinces with 32
percent, according to a survey conducted by Vietnam's National
Institute of Nutrition.
</P>
<P>
The biggest at-risk group were 6-18 months old infants, the
survey revealed.
</P>
<P>
Threats of micro malnutrition, vitamin and iodine deficiency
are also high for Vietnamese children -- a problem Vietnam's
National Institute of Nutrition plans to tackle especially among
pregnant women and children under two.
</P>
<P>
The survey also indicated that breast feeding and supplementary
food practices have a vital role to play in fighting malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
However, Vietnamese researchers said they were dismayed that
only 43 percent of mothers were provided with Vitamin A after a
month of giving birth.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's National Institute of Nutrition will urge local
provinces to promote breast feeding and encourage supplementary
food policies but warns that children shouldn't be given
supplementary food too young.

<P>
The News:

<HEADLINE> Partial Access of U.S. Split-Runs to Canadian Advertising Allowed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Canada and the United States have
reached a tentative agreement to end their eight-month dispute
over Canada's proposed magazine legislation, announced Canadian
Heritage Minister Sheila Copps and International Trade Minister
Sergio Marchi on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The compromise would allow American publishers that produce
Canadian magazines, also known as split-runs, to print up to 18
percent of Canadian advertising per issue, and the levels would be
phased in over three years, with 12 percent in the first year, 15
in the second and 18 in the third, said the officials.
</P>
<P>
The magazines would have to produce a majority of Canadian
content, or face the original system of fines proposed in Bill C-
55, proposed by the heritage minister last October and designed to
keep out split-runs, which cost little to publish and therefore
can afford to charge advertisers much less than Canadian magazines.
</P>
<P>
Canadian officials initially refused to allow split-runs access
to more than 10 percent of Canadian advertising, while their U.S.
counterparts steadfastly demanded 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The original structure of the bill would have penalized foreign
publishers that printed Canadian advertising geared towards the
Canadian Market.
</P>
<P>
The Bill went before a Senate committee, which heard Tuesday
from Sergio Marchi. "The right agreement is there. The basic bill
certainly remains," said the international trade minister.
</P>
<P>
Copps and Marchi hailed the bill as proof that the United
States has finally recognized the need for a country to protect
its culture.
</P>
<P>
"For the first time in the history of the United States, they
have recognized that cultural protection and promotion is a
legitimate trade objective," Copps said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian Magazine Publishers Association has said that
granting anything more than 10 percent would cause serious damage
to the national magazine industry.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government will provide up to 100 million Canadian
Dollars (68 million U.S. dollars) in subsidies to help the
Canadian industry adjust, another official source said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of the International
Monetary Fund will arrive in Brazil early next month to revise the
objectives of a previously agreed accord to enable Brazil to get
further IMF loans.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's Secretary of Economic Politics of the Finance Ministry
Edward Amadeo said the IMF delegation will check the goals to
which Brazil must adhere throughout the 3rd and 4th quarters of
the year.
</P>
<P>
He said there is a possibility that Brazil may not receive the
third part of an emergency loan if Brazil failed to get the
revision. "The decision, to eventually obtain the loan, depends
on the flow of capital and the level of international reserves in
the country."
</P>
<P>
Brazil's Central Bank reported that the country's foreign
exchange reserves until May 25 reached 44.62 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Brazil has received the first and second parts of the loan,
adding up to 18 billion U.S. dollars. The country is expecting
the third and fourth parts of the loan which in total will be 41.5
billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Pepper Exports Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia exported 7,049 metric
tons of pepper from January to April, 36 percent higher than the
corresponding period of last year, The Jakarta Post reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the International Pepper Community (IPC), the
volume of Indonesian black pepper exports showed a downward trend,
but the volume of white pepper exports consistently increased.
</P>
<P>
"This phenomenon indicates a very limited inventory for black
pepper until the upcoming crop sometime in September or October,"
IPC said in its latest market review.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is the world's top producer of white pepper and ranks
the second highest black pepper producer after India.
</P>
<P>
IPC said the world pepper market during April was active, but
new stocks from Vietnam and Malaysia caused a downward trend in
prices.
</P>
<P>
"Pepper prices at source markets have decreased in the range of
1.9 percent and 9.2 percent when compared to the prevailing
average price during March 1999," the market review said.
</P>
<P>
"Prices have been shown to increase in May 1999 and the trend
appears to continue until Brazilian and Indonesian crops come," it
said.
</P>
<P>
IPC is an intergovernmental organization of pepper-producing
countries comprising Brazil, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri
Lanka, Thailand, Papua New Guinea and Micronesia.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, IPC predicted Indonesia's pepper exports
would drop 26 percent to approximately 30,000 tons this year from
37,800 tons last year due to unfavorable weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
Total pepper exports from the three main producing countries --
India, Indonesia and Malaysia -- rose 31 percent to 27,691 tons in
the first four months of this year from 21,111 metric tons in the
same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
World pepper exports reached 125,957 tons in 1998, down from
138,589 tons in 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, May 26 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
and Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov met here Wednesday to
discuss the Kosovo crisis, with neither side releasing any new
information that might be considered special after their talks.
</P>
<P>
Annan said at a news briefing that they focused on "What the
next step will be once we have a breakthrough."
</P>
<P>
He said the United Nations will be able to play a pivotal role
once an agreement on the peaceful solution to the Kosovo crisis is
reached.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov reiterated Russia's stand on the issue, claiming that
NATO has violated international law in its air raids against
Yugoslavia and must end the attacks.
</P>
<P>
Neither Annan nor Ivanov elaborated on the details of their
talks.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he valued the efforts made by Russia's Balkans envoy
Viktor Chernomyrdin, the U.S. Deputy State of Secretary Strobe
Talbott, and Finnish President and European Union envoy Martti
Ahtisaari, to seek a political settlement of the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said all aspects of the international community were making
special efforts for a peaceful solution to the Balkan crisis.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief affirmed that prior to his talks with Ivanov, he
made a phone call to Chernomyrdin, Talbott and Ahtisaari, who were
discussing the Kosovo crisis in Moscow. He also talked with his
two Balkan envoys, former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Beldt and
Slovakian Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan, in the Swedish capital.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov met Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson and Foreign
Minister Anna Lindh before the talks with Annan.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish leaders reportedly stressed Russia's role in
settling the Kosovo crisis. Both sides also discussed the
possibility of having Sweden participate in the international
peace-keeping forces to be deployed in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish foreign minister said after the talks that Sweden's
involvement in the peace-keeping mission will have U.N. approval.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov arrived here on Wednesday for talks with Swedish leaders.
Annan returned to Moscow on the same day.

<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United produced one of
the most amazing comeback in soccer history to beat Bayern Munich
2-1 with two injury time goals in Wednesday's European Cup final
in Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
German champions Bayern Munich had been leading from the sixth
minute through a Mario Basler free-kick before substitute Teddy
Sheringham equalised with a right-foot shot for Manchester United
in the 89th minute.
</P>
<P>
Ninety seconds later, another substitute Ole Gunnar Solskjaer
of Norway swept in the winner from close range after a David
Beckham corner had been headed on by Sheringham.
</P>
<P>
The victory gave United, who completed an English cup and
league double four days ago, a unique treble in the British soccer
history. And in Europea, United is the only third side to complete
the soccer feat besides Celtic (1967) and Ajax Amsterdam (1972).
</P>
<P>
With captain Roy Keane and midfielder Paul Scholes suspended,
coach Alex Ferguson had to employ David Beckham, Ryan Giggs and
Jesper Blomqvist in unfamiliar positions in midfield.
</P>
<P>
Not until Ferguson abandoned his policy and brought on
Sheringham and Solskjaer in place of Blomqvist and Andy Cole, did
United finally find their way.
</P>
<P>
Bayern had had two golden chances to seal the win when their
substitute Mehmet Scholl hit the post after 78 minutes and Carsten
Jancker hit the bar with an overhead scissor kick six minutes
later.
</P>
<P>
But United, who formed a habit of scoring late goals this
season, refused to give in, and recorded the most dramatic end to
a European final since the event was introduced in 1956.
</P>
<P>
It was United's first European Cup success since their only
previous win in 1968. It was also United's 33rd match without
defeat and secured England's first European Cup success since
Liverpool in 1984.
</P>
<P>
Ferguson, having completed his lifelong ambition which he
stated when he arrived at Old Trafford 13 years ago, now stands as
one of the most successful British managers.

CHANGCHUN, May 27 (Xinhua) -- People with special talents or
skills are becoming increasingly expensive in the northeastern
Chinese province of Jilin, where companies are trying to beat the
competition with more attractive salaries.
</P>
<P>
The annual pay being offered to a promising manager at a job
fair in the capital of Jilin on Tuesday, for example, could run as
high as 160,000 yuan. There were 51 enterprises at the fair
competing for people to fill 10 job spots by bidding.
</P>
<P>
The bidding ran from 30,000 yuan to 120,000 yuan for MBAs,
experienced managers, and students who have studied overseas. Han
Guangming, a 34-year-old with a master's degree in marketing, said
that the hot bidding indicated that their knowledge was valuable.
</P>
<P>
One biological products manufacturer hired four people. Its
president Wang Hengwei said that competition in a market economy
is a competition for talented people and that enterprises should
not begrudge paying them well given the high profits they can
produce.

<HEADLINE> Greece Supports Bulgaria, Romania's Admission into EU, NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria and Romania's admission into
the European Union (EU) and NATO will not only help strengthen
stability in the Balkan region but also facilitate further
economic development of countries in the region, visiting Greek
President Costis Stephanopoulos said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Stephanopoulos, who was here on a three-day official visit,
made the remark at a joint news conference with his Bulgarian
counterpart, Peter Stoyanov.
</P>
<P>
During the news conference, the president confirmed Greece's
support for Bulgaria and Romania's efforts to obtain membership in
the two blocs. He described as justified the two countries' wish
for an early launching of admission negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Noting that stability in the Balkans depends on cooperation
among countries in the region, the Greek head of state said
friendship between Bulgaria and Romania is an example of such
cooperation. He pointed out that both countries are interested in
a settlement of the Kosovo conflict as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Stoyanov agreed and said, "Today the problem is not only to
establish peace in the Balkans, but also to guarantee stability
and prosperity of the region."
</P>
<P>
He described as making the Balkans an integral part of Europe a
major task after the achievement of peace on the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria is among the countries most interested in achieving
peace in Kosovo, not only because of the humanitarian aspects of
the Kosovo crisis, but also because of the economic losses
Bulgaria has suffered every day since the eruption of the crisis,
Stoyanov said.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether Bulgaria would support the Greek proposal
for a halt to NATO's air strikes against Yugoslavia, he said
Bulgaria will unhesitatingly support every peace proposal
endorsing lasting prospects of stability and prosperity in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Greece supports the need for economic assistance to the Balkan
countries affected by the Kosovo crisis, Stephanopoulos said. The
future reconstruction and economic development of the region are
also major topics between the two presidents.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Stephanopoulos will meet Bulgarian Prime
Minister Ivan Kostov, Sofia Mayor Stefan Sofiyanski, and Patriarch
Maksim. He will also attend a Bulgarian-Greek economic forum and
will meet leaders of other political parties.
</P>
<P>
Accompanying the president are Greek Development Minister
Evangelos Venizelos, Deputy Foreign Minister Grigoros Niotis, and
a 25-member business delegation.

<HEADLINE> Colombia to Promote Peace Process: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARTAGENA DE INDIAS (Colombia), May 26 (Xinhua) -- Colombian
President Abdres Pastrana said here Wednesday that his government
will further promote the peace process dubbed "Colombians for
Colombians."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the 11th summit of the Andean
countries, Pastrana said the government should not fear
negotiating during the process.
</P>
<P>
He said the process has gained support from all sectors, and as
always, from the military forces.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana said the process requires strength to maintain
optimism without losing sight of the objectives, which are to find
the strength to understand, the necessity to adjust to the time
and the terms of the process, and the strength to smooth the way
with imagination and audacity.
</P>
<P>
As president of the summit meeting, the Colombian president
described the help and support from neighboring countries and
friends as another factor of hope and confidence in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the Colombian military forces repeated its
support to the president after the resignation of Defense Minister
Rodrigo Lloreda.
</P>
<P>
The acting Defense Minister and Commander in Chief of the
Colombian Military Forces General Fernando Tapias, said the
military is devoted to the constitution and to the president of
the republic. He said they were not foes but supporters of the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
General Tapias was appointed as acting defense minister
following the resignation of Rodrigo Lloreda and at least six
other generals who were in disagreement with the ongoing peace
process in the country.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Lloreda stepped up his criticism of government
concessions to the rebel group, which is called the Revolutionary
armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), saying that the government had
given up too much in exchange for little or nothing from FARC.
</P>
<P>
In order to continue the peace process, President Pastrana
ordered all government troops out of an area of 42,000 square
kilometers in November, ceding it to FARC in order to bolster
peace talks and end a conflict that has claimed more than 35,000
lives over the last decade.

Fujimori made the decision for security reasons.

<P>
HANOI, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam granted Most Favored Nation
(MFN) status to Japan on Wednesday, allowing Japanese imports to
enjoy long-term preferential tariffs, press reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's extension of MFN status to Japan was made on a
reciprocal basis under which the Japanese government Wednesday
granted the same status to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The decisions of the two countries were made following an
agreement on the exchange of MFN treatment reached between
Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van Khai and his Japanese
counterpart Keizo Obuchi during Khai's visit to Japan in late
March.
</P>
<P>
Two-way trade between Vietnam and Japan reached 3.48 billion
U.S. dollars in 1997. Of this, Vietnamese exports totaled 2.2
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Japan is Vietnam's largest bilateral aid donor.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, Vietnam has granted MFN status to 66 countries and
regions including China, Russia, Australia, Canada, Germany and
other ASEAN countries.

<HEADLINE> More China's Private Businesses Value Talents More Than Family Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, May 27 (Xinhua) --More private businesses in
China are paying high salaries to talents who are not family
members and are giving them jobs as general managers or putting
them in charge of production and marketing.
</P>
<P>
These people are playing an important role in leading China's
private economy. According to research of the Hebei Provincial
Government's Policy Research Office, among 5,000 private
businesses with assets of more than 10 million yuan, 85 percent
have done away with a family-based, nepotistic management mode and
have started using a professional corporate management system that
emphasizes competence.
</P>
<P>
The Hualian Cashmere Processing Group in Hebei's Qinghe County
is a family business used to be run by eight brothers each of whom
has only nine years of schooling, and that made growth difficult,
says Chen Donghua, one of the brothers. So, in the end, they
decided to hire a more capable person from a state-owned
enterprise in Inner Mongolia as a marketing manager.
</P>
<P>
The move has worked. The new manager bases the product mix on
market studies and has made more efforts in opening up markets.
The group is able to earn 12 million yuan from sales in a short
period of time.
</P>
<P>
The improved training of workers has led to increased quality
of products and eventually to improved marketing. To survive in
the fast-growing market, many private businesses that were mom and
pop workshops have stopped relying heavily on processing and begun
to hire more competent people to pursue development that is based
on technology. The State Council's Development and Research Center
says that high-tech companies now account for 12 percent of the
country's private businesses. These companies have developed more
than 10,000 new products, many of which are in line with
international standards.

<HEADLINE> "Global Democratization," Camouflage of U.S. Hegemony: Article (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Xinhua today published a signed
article by Wang Jincun, a senior researcher with the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences. The full text of the article, entitled
"Global Democratization -- Camouflage of U.S. Hegemony," reads as
following:
</P>
<P>
While striving to build a single-polared world and to
strengthen its hegemony, the United States has put forward various
kinds of power politics theories. One example of these is the "
global democratization" concept.
</P>
<P>
After launching the war of aggression against Yugoslavia, the U.
S.-led NATO has trumpeted the theory in a bigger way, in an
attempt to cover up its atrocities. What on earth is the "global
democratization?"
</P>
<P>
The critical points of "global democratization" are to deprive
and to trample on the sovereignty of developing nations. The
theoretical basis for "global democratization" is the so-called "
modern sovereignty theory" or the "limited sovereignty theory", or
the "democracy leading to peace theory", or the theory that
national sovereignty is an outdated notion. These theories have
been popular for some time in the United States and some other
NATO member nations.
</P>
<P>
The core of the "global democratization" concept is the so-
called "global democracy value" and the theory that "human rights
outweigh national sovereignty." According to the theory, the
concept of national sovereignty and the principles of
international relations based on national sovereignty are outmoded.
Even the United Nations and the UN Charter, established according
to the principle of national sovereignty, are also out of fashion.

BUENAS AIRES, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Argentina's Vice Minister of
Economy Pablo Guidotti said on Wednesday that the rumours of a
possible devaluation of the Argentine currency, the peso, "have no
foundation."
</P>
<P>
These rumours have affected the local markets of the country
and the region, and have arisen "for speculative reasons," over
the past few days, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately, the markets have calmed down in the face of the
evidence that there will not be changes" he said, referring to the
Argentine policy on the free exchange of the peso against the U.S.
dollar, which was initiated on April 1, 1991.
</P>
<P>
"These types of rumours cannot last more than two or three days,
as they were absolutely groundless," said Guidotti at a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate of the Argentine peso against the U.S. dollar
stood at 1:1.0005 Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Carter Named NBA Rookie of the Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Vince Carter, who led the
Toronto Raptors in scoring while becoming known for his thunderous
and spectacular dunks, today was named as the runaway winner of
the NBA's Rookie of the Year award.
</P>
<P>
Carter received all but five of a possible 118 votes from a
panel of sports writers and broadcasters. Sacramento Kings point
guard Jason Williams finished second and forward Paul Pierce of
the Boston Celtics was third.
</P>
<P>
Cater was selected fifth overall last June by the Golden State
Warriors but was traded on draft day to Toronto for the previous
pick, Antawn Jamision, who teamed with Carter in leading North
Carolina to back-to-back Final Fours in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
Toronto went a respectable 23-27, missing an Eastern Conference
playoff spot by four games with Carter as the go-to-player from
the outset. He led all rookies with 18.3 points per game and
scored 20 or more points 20 times.
</P>
<P>
Carter, who scored a season-high 32 points in a loss at Houston
on March 24, also averaged 5.7 rebounds, 3.0 assists, 1.54 blocked
shots and 1.10 steals while shooting 45 percent from the field
over 35.2 minutes per game. He started 40 of Toronto's 50 games.
</P>
<P>
Named Rookie of the Month for March and April, Carter was the
only rookie this season to garner Player of the Week honors, doing
so after leading the Raptors to a 5-0 record during the week
ending March 21.

<HEADLINE> Argentina Sends First Balloon to Measure Ozone Over Antarctic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENAS AIRES, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Argentina's National
Directorship of the Antarctic on Wednesday launched the country's
first aerostatic balloon to measure the ozone layer and conditions,
from the General Belgrano base.
</P>
<P>
The launch was performed in cooperation with the Institute of
Aerospace Techniques of Spain, said the organization.
</P>
<P>
The sphere which has a diameter of 1.8 meters, will reach an
altitude of 30,000 meters to measure the ozone level in the
atmosphere and transmit valuable information back to the ground
base.
</P>
<P>
If this experiment is successful, Argentina plans to launch two
balloons every month in the future, and will launch two balloons
per week throughout September, as this is the time when the hole
in the ozone layer is more obvious, the local media reported.

<HEADLINE> Statistics Show Duncan More Impressive Than Malone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- All indications are that Karl
Malone is about to be announced as the winner of this season's NBA
Most Valuable Player Award, but all statistics have showed Tim
Duncan is better than him in many fields.
</P>
<P>
Based on a rating system that compares 10 of objective
statistical categories, though, Malone gets edged out for MVP by
San Antonio's Duncan and Shaquille O'Neal of the Los Angeles
Lakers comes in third.
</P>
<P>
The 10 candidates were picked subjectively by sportswriters and
sportscasters who regularly cover the league and the criteria are
subjective.
</P>
<P>
The candidates ranked against each other in 10 categories
designed to evaluate a player's total value. The candidates
selected, along with Duncan, Malone and O'neal were Alonzo
Mourning, Grant Hill, Allen Iverson, Gary Payton, Jason Kidd,
Kevin Garnett and Chris Webber.
</P>
<P>
The categories are field goal percentage, free throws made a
game, scoring average, rebound average, assist average, points
scored per shot attempt, away attendance, winning percentage of
the player's team, the number of games missed and hands, which
adds steals and blocked shots and subtracts turnovers and personal
fouls.
</P>
<P>
The player with the best performance in a particular category
was given one point and the worst in a category was given 10
points. The points in all 10 categories were added, the lowest
total score is the MVP.
</P>
<P>
Malone was the only player to finish first in at least three
categories. Duncan had two firsts and was in the top five in seven
of the 10 categories.
</P>
<P>
Fourth place Mourning was in the top three in six categories
but was last in assists and next to last in games played. Allen
Iverson, buoyed by a first in scoring, and seconds in attracting
fans and in free throws made per game, finished sixth.

<HEADLINE> China Auctions Old Grain Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- China yesterday auctioned some of
its old grain reserves in Zhengzhou, capital of central China's
Henan province.
</P>
<P>
The batch of grain was mostly imported from Canada, the United
States and Australia in 1996, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The auction was organized by the State Grain Reserves Bureau,
the Agricultural Development Bank, the Ministry of Finance and the
State Development Planning Commission. The Zhengzhou Commodities
Exchange was the broker of the sales.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, China imported 8.25 million tons of wheat, although
its wheat yields that year amounted to 110.57 million tons,
according to the National Bureau of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
The auction will give the State experience to further break the
monopoly of the country's grain distribution system, which for
decades has been operated by State-run grain supply and marketing
companies, a grain expert was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the government used to reduce grain surplus by
allocating it to lower administrative levels.
</P>
<P>
The expert reasoned that the development also reflects the
government's confidence in the wheat yields this year.

<HEADLINE> Bank Savings Still Favored in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Most residents in China's leading
industrial and commercial city of Shanghai still prefer putting
their spare money in bank deposit accounts to other ways of saving,
according to a recent sample survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the Shanghai Economic Society,
indicates that about 64 percent of the 8,441 respondents choose to
put their spare money in banks.
</P>
<P>
Only 22.8 percent of the residents surveyed would like to
invest in securities and futures, 9.9 percent prefer to buy
insurance policies, and another 18.5 percent will spend their
spare cash on tourism.
</P>
<P>
Most people say they are saving for a wide range of purposes
such as the education of children and helping out with family
expenses in future years.
</P>
<P>
Geng Zhongping, a professor with Shanghai's Tongji University,
who was in charge of the survey, said that the results show local
residents are more active in preventing risks in life.
</P>
<P>
Chinese people depended on the state for nearly everything in
the past few decades, Geng added.
</P>
<P>
Official estimates put the average total savings value of
Shanghai residents at 21,000 yuan per person by the end of 1997,
in addition to an average of 2,000 yuan worth of stocks and
securities.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 27 (Xinhua) -- A court in the city of Foshan in
south China's Guangdong Province has sentenced four people to life
or fixed terms of imprisonment for kidnapping two people.
</P>
<P>
Liu Xinghua and Ke Yingguang were sentenced to life
imprisonment and deprived of their political rights for life by
the court which sat Tuesday. Liu Guoshun and Liu Yonghua were
sentenced to 14 years and 10 years imprisonment respectively and
given fines of 14,000 yuan and 10,000 yuan each.
</P>
<P>
The four were charged with kidnapping the son of a Hong Kong
businessman in 1992 and a Hong Kong businessman in 1993 and
demanding ransoms totaling five million Hong Kong dollars.
</P>
<P>
They are believed to be members of a criminal gang led by Hong
Kong resident Cheung Tze-keung, who was sentenced to death by the
Intermediate People's Court of Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong
Province, last December.
</P>
<P>
The 36-member gang, 18 from Hong Kong and the rest from

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves 300-Million-Dollar Credit for Algeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) approved on Wednesday a credit totaling 300 million U.S.
dollars for Algeria under the Compensatory and Contingency
Financing Facility (CCFF) to help the African country offset a
temporary shortfall in exports of goods and services.
</P>
<P>
The CCFF aims to assist IMF members experiencing temporary
shortfalls in export earnings. The loans are repayable between
3.25 and 5 years, and carry a standard annual interest charge,
which is currently 3.52 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian economy remains heavily dependent on the petroleum
sector, which accounts for about one quarter of gross domestic
product (GDP), and contributes slightly more than half of
government revenues, and virtually all of the country's export
receipts.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the external environment worsened as the average oil
export price fell by 33 percent. Consequently, the fiscal balance
moved from a surplus of 2.4 percent of GDP in 1997 to a deficit in
1998 of 3.9 percent of GDP and the external current account
deteriorated sharply from a surplus of 7 percent of GDP to a
deficit of about 2 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, thanks to a recovery in agricultural output and a
turnaround in industrial activity, estimated real GDP grew by 4
percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Despite a modest recovery in world oil and gas prices,
Algeria's external position has continued to be adversely
affected," the IMF said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Against this background, the Algerian authorities remain
committed to build on the stabilization achievements of the last
three years, and it is expected that the direction of economic
policy-making will be maintained by the new government toward
ensuring macroeconomic stability and accelerating structural
reforms," it added.

<HEADLINE> Romania Scores Record Suicides in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Romania scored in the year 1998
the biggest number of suicides in the last decade, the official
Rompres news agency Wednesday reported quoting data supplied by
National Forensic Medicine Institute.
</P>
<P>
As many as 3,660 suicide cases were registered all over Romania
in the year 1998, which means a surge of 6.4 percent against 1997
and of 24.8 percent against 1996. The annual national average
amounts to 14.6 suicides in 100,000 inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
Forensic experts analysed the suicide rate over 1985-1989
compared with the period after 1990 and found that the fast,
progressive deterioration of Romania's social, economic and
political life was in direct proportion to the number of people
who committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
After 1990 a permanent increase of the figure was noticed, with
the climax year of 1998. The ascending curve was put and end to in
the election year 1996 which, maybe, gave the Romanians hope, so
that only 267 suicides were scored, but it was resumed later.

<P>
The average age of those who committed suicide is 50.9, showed
the data of National Forensic Medicine Institute.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder, Fischer Say NATO's Five Demands Not Negotiable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 26 (Xinhua)--Key German leaders Wednesday said NATO's
five demands to Yugoslavia as condition for halting air attacks
were not negotiable.
</P>
<P>
The five demands include withdrawal of all Yugoslav troops from
Kosovo and deployment of an international force with NATO troops
at its core.
</P>
<P>
NATO's demands "must be met without any limitations," said
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder after talks with visiting Bulgarian
Prime Minister Ivan Kostov in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
But the details and the timetable may be part of negotiations,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer echoed Schroeder's statement
by saying NATO would not be ready for a compromise with
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with visiting British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook, Fischer said: " militarily we are superior to Yugoslavia,
and we are more determined."
</P>
<P>
But Fischer again ruled out any possibility that Germany send
ground combat forces to Kosovo, saying it a "hypothetical
question".
</P>
<P>
The German parliament has only pass a bill for sending
peacekeeping forces in Kosovo after diplomatic negotiations, he
said.

NEW YORK, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks rebounded
strongly Wednesday as traders eased their concerns about higher
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 171.07 at 10,702.16.
The index lost 356.26 points or 3.2 percent in the past four
sessions.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index rose 20.36 at 1,304.76 and the technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index rose 46.28 at 2,427.18.
</P>
<P>
Investors' concerns about interest rates were eased after the
Commerce Department reported that orders for big-ticket
manufactured goods fell 2.3 percent last month. The report showed
evidence that the economic is not overheated so that the Federal
Reserve has no need to raise interest rates.
</P>
<P>
In response to a 0.7 percent increase in consumer prices in
April, the Federal Reserve decided a week ago to leave interest
rates unchanged but leaned to monetary tightening if more signs of
inflationary pressures emerge. The move had pulled the market
down.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index rose 7.50 at 624.84 and the American
Stock Exchange index rose 3.82 at 782.66. The Russell 2000 index
of smaller companies rose 0.96 at 435.41.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues barely outnumbered advancers on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 1,498 down, 1,477 up and 557 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased to 868.39 million shares from 816.28
million in the previous session.
