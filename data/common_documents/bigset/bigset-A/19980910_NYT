JUAN METZGER, 79, WHO PUT THE FRUITIN YOGURT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SHARON R. KING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Juan E. Metzger,the man credited with turning yogurt
_ an obscure, highly acidic dairy product _ into a fruit-flavored
staple in the diets of many Americans, died Sept. 6 at his home in
New York. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure following complications from a
stroke in December, said his brother-in-law, James Lomuscio.
</P>
<P>
   Metzger served as president of Dannon Co., the yogurt maker,
starting in 1959, and became its chairman in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   His first job at the company, which had been co-founded by his
father, was to clean and sterilize re-usable glass jars. He is
widely credited as the first to suggest putting fruit in the bottom
of yogurt containers _ strawberry was the first _ an addition that
improved its flavor and increased its appeal to Americans.
Moreover, his efforts to heavily advertise and market yogurt are
said to have helped to increase American consumption of it. In
1942, he spent $2,000 on an unsuccessful campaign promoting yogurt
as a meat substitute.
</P>
<P>
   Metzger's advertising campaigns capitalized on such healthful
qualities of yogurt as its low-fat and low-sugar content. He was so
successful in his marketing of Dannon that he was named ``Marketer
of the Decade'' in the 1970s by Marketing Communications, a trade
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   An avid skier, he heavily promoted the product at ski resorts,
recalled Harold Burson, founder and chairman of Burson-Marsteller,
the advertising and public relations firm.
</P>
<P>
   Metzger was also credited with expanding the overall yogurt
market, attracting competitors to Dannon, while also continuing to
increase Dannon's own sales. William Camacho, a former marketing
director at Dannon, said, ``He took pride in the statement that he
took a company from a 90 percent market share to a 60 percent
market share and still was a success because he grew the market for
the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Metzger approved the well-known Dannon commercial, ``The Old
Russians,'' created in 1973 by the agency Marsteller Inc. Filmed in
the mountains of Soviet Georgia, it showed an 89-year-old man and
his 114-year-old mother leading active lives by eating yogurt. In
1996, Advertising Age, the trade publication, chose the spot as one
of the 50 greatest commercials of all time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had an instinctive flair for public relations that was more
perceptive than most professionals in the field,'' said Milton
Sutton, a longtime friend and former vice president of Marsteller.
``He broadened the line of flavors and extended their retail
outlets until the Dannon brand became a household name from coast
to coast.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Metzger, Dannon increased its yogurt product line to 15
items and introduced Danny, a frozen yogurt. In 1979, Dannon yogurt
became the first perishable dairy product distributed across the
country. It carried a 25- to 30-day freshness date code, and
Dannon's own route drivers delivered it to stores and reclaimed it
at the expiration dates.
</P>
<P>
   Dannon was founded in the Bronx by Daniel Carasso and his friend
Joe Metzger, a Swiss-born industrialist. In Spain and France,
Carasso's father, Isaac, had manufactured a cultured milk product
called Danone, named after his young son, ``Little Daniel.'' Daniel
Carasso came to New York in 1942 to sell his product. He teamed up
with Joe Metzger and Americanized the name of the company, calling
it Dannon Milk Co. Juan Metzger, born in Barcelona, Spain, in 1918,
was almost 24 at the time.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959, after Carasso had returned to France, the multinational
conglomerate Beatrice Foods bought the company, for $3 million in
Beatrice stock, as part of its plans to expand into more profitable
and growing specialty food products. Metzger was a vice president
of Beatrice at the same time that he headed Dannon. Beatrice sold
Dannon in 1982 for $84 million to BSN Groupe, a French company that
is now called Groupe Danone, after its leading international brand.
</P>
<P>
   Metzger retired from Dannon in 1981 and became a business
consultant to entrepreneurs in the food industry.
</P>
<P>
   In World War II, he served in Army military intelligence,
interrogating prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Florence, of Manhattan; three
children, Joe and Timothy, of Manhattan, and Jacqueline of Seattle;
a granddaughter, Jill, and a sister, Miriam Koryn of Scarsdale.
</P>
<P>
   As testament to its increasing popularity, per capita sales of
yogurt have increased from 1.5 pounds in 1974 to an estimated 5
pounds in 1998, according to the Agriculture Department and
Business Trends Analysts data. Last year, the Agriculture
Department also approved the use of yogurt as an alternative to
meat in school lunches.

GIANTS SIGN GRAY; HAMILTON'S ROLE SHAKY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Another week, another significant
transaction. These are not your father's Giants.
</P>
<P>
   The notoriously cautious New York Giants are acquiring new
players and tearing up old contracts under general manager Ernie
Accorsi with striking regularity. Wednesday, they acquired the
former Indianapolis cornerback Carlton Gray, who should eventually
replace Conrad Hamilton as the starting right cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   Gray, who signed a four-year contract that will pay him $1.4
million this season, could play in certain third-down packages
Sunday against the Oakland Raiders. He could unseat Hamilton as the
starter by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants have been tracking Gray for months, anticipating that
he might be a training camp casualty at Indianapolis. The Colts'
new president, Bill Polian, had recently acquired cornerback Tyrone
Poole, whom Polian had drafted in the first round when he was
general manager of the Carolina Panthers in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when Gray's starting job was given to Poole as
expected, Gray did what he could to get out of his contract with
the Colts. Step one was expressing his disenchantment with the
team's decision to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts, who a week earlier could have traded Gray to any
number of teams _ including the Giants _ and received some form of
compensation, released Gray.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, more than a dozen teams contacted Gray's
agent, Marvin Demoff. Gray visited the Giants first. After some
wrangling, Gray chose the Giants because he said it gave him the
best chance to see playing time for a winning team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in the league six years, always with a losing team
and it gets old,'' said Gray, who was the second-round draft pick
of Seattle five years ago out of UCLA. As an unrestricted free
agent during the winter of 1996-97, he signed with Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Giants didn't offer me the most money. But chasing money
is what got me to Indianapolis and I saw what that situation turned
out to be. I was real comfortable with the coaches here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants coaches have not assured Gray, 27, that he will
start. In fact, they told him they were reasonably happy with
Hamilton's performance against the Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   But Gray is 6 feet and 200 pounds, which makes him 2 inches
taller than Hamilton. Giants scouts were impressed with Gray during
the preseason and consider him faster than Hamilton as well. And,
Gray has far more experience, having started 58 National Football
League games. Hamilton made his second NFL start last week.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Giants coaches insisted that Hamilton was still their
starter, but they didn't assure him that his standing would remain
unchallenged.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a competitive business,'' said the Giants' defensive
coordinator, John Fox. ``We're going to play the best guys, the
guys who give the Giants the best chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Gray, Fox said: ``He has good height, good deep speed, he's
experienced and he picks things up quickly. He's proven himself as
a starter in this league. How much we use him depends on how fast
he can learn our system.''
</P>
<P>
   Giants Coach Jim Fassel also raved about Gray.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an outstanding corner and I'm excited about him being
here,'' Fassel said. ``We're fortunate to have him. I remember
coaching against him. I thought he was a real talent. I thought he
could cover most people you would put out there. He's a very smooth
guy. You couldn't fool him. He seemed like he was prepared for
games. He was just a real fluid athlete who had some size and could
cover people.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, whose locker is next to Gray's, said he was not
ruffled by Gray's presence on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a business,'' he said. ``If I start to falter, it'll be a
challenge. But it's my job and my job to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   To make room for Gray, the Giants waived the rookie tight end
Andy Haase. Haase could remain with the Giants on the team's
practice squad. Tight end Al Pupunu, who has been sidelined with
strained knee ligaments, will play this weekend and practiced with
the team Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   _ Two key players, linebackers JESSIE ARMSTEAD and MARCUS
BUCKLEY, did not practice Wednesday because of injuries. Armstead
(ankle sprain) was listed as questionable for Sunday's game and
Buckley (hip pointer) was listed as probable. The Giants, however,
expect both to play. Safety BRANDON SANDERS (midfoot sprain) is
also questionable for the Raiders game.
</P>
<P>
   _ Defensive end Michael Strahan was named the National Football
Conference defensive player of the week; he had two sacks and
returned an interception for a touchdown against Washington. &QL;

At 71, Paterno still hooked on coaching
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By BILL SULLIVAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
He was going to be a lawyer, just like his father before him.
Football had been fun, and he was going to miss it, certainly, but
Boston University law school was awaiting his arrival, and a
scrawny ex-college quarterback was ready to get on with his life.
</P>
<P>
   Then Rip Engle, his old coach at Brown, called. Engle had just
taken the Penn State job, and he could use a little help, and
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to do it,'' Joe Paterno recalled the other day.
``But my dad and I owed $2,000 at the time. I didn't want to borrow
any more money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought if I went to coach a couple of years _ I was single
_ that maybe I could make some money, save it, and then go back to
law school.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a half century later, Boston U. is still waiting. Joe
Paterno never did make it back to law school, but it's beginning to
look like the career path he chose instead may work out after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came down and got hooked on coaching,'' he said. ``There
were times when we'd lose a couple or things didn't go the way I
thought they should that I'd think about going to law school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank goodness I never did that.''
</P>
<P>
   Deep in the heart of Pennsylvania, the feeling is shared, and
the ongoing love affair between the Brooklyn native and his adopted
home makes Saturday's game with Bowling Green just a little more
special. In his 33rd year as head coach of the Nittany Lions,
Paterno needs only one more victory for No. 300, a figure only
three Division I-A coaches have been able to reach before him.
</P>
<P>
   Should Penn State _ a 38-point point favorite _ somehow find a
way to squeak by the Falcons, the ever-fretting ``JoePa'' would
join Bear Bryant, Pop Warner and Amos Alonzo Stagg in the Division
I-A 300 club. (Eddie Robinson and John Gagliardi turned the trick
at schools below that level.) Paterno, however, would have the
distinction of getting there more quickly than any of them, needing
only 380 games. (Bryant won No. 300 in his 393rd game, currently
the fastest ever to achieve the milestone.)
</P>
<P>
   All of this, as you might expect, has made for considerable
discussion in college football circles this week, even if the event
has been dwarfed by Mark McGwire's headline-seizing blast into
baseball history. The buildup also has made for a long and
uncomfortable few days for the bespectacled 71-year-old who finds
himself squarely at the center of some decidedly unwanted
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Paterno would just as soon talk about McGwire. Better yet, he
wishes folks would concentrate on his ninth-ranked team. And lest
anyone forget, there is this dangerous Bowling Green outfit the
coach insists ``can beat us,'' contrary to the evidence provided by
last week's 37-0 drubbing at the hands of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's forget about Joe Paterno,'' Paterno pleads. ``Let's talk
about Bowling Green and the Penn State football team.''
</P>
<P>
   No such luck.
</P>
<P>
   Not this week, at least.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to sound like I'm not grateful,'' he says. ``I
don't want to sound like a big phony here. I feel good about it.
But I have a hard time saying, `Boy, oh, boy.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope someday I'll have time for that.''
</P>
<P>
   As opening wins go, it was hardly one that augured greatness. If
anything, Joe Paterno's first game as head coach was just the stuff
to have a young man thinking that law school might not have been
such a bad idea after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably as poorly coached a team as you ever saw,'' he
recalls.
</P>
<P>
   The opponent: Maryland, led by Lou Saban, who was returning from
the American Football League to take over the Terrapins for the
1966 season. Penn State won 15-7 in something less than a classic.
</P>
<P>
   Paterno ran out onto the field to offer the customary greetings,
only to come away empty-handed
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran over to see Lou, and I couldn't find him,'' he recalls.
``I was a little bit dejected.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Saban explained the snub.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called me on Monday,'' Paterno said, ``and said, `Joe, I
want to apologize for not coming over to congratulate you. But we
were both so lousy, I didn't have the heart.'''
</P>
<P>
   Paterno's first team would, indeed, be one of his worst. The
Nittany Lions went 5-5 and then opened the '67 season with a loss
to Navy.
</P>
<P>
   No one was thinking in terms of three-decade stays or budding
legends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was having my doubts,'' Paterno said.
</P>
<P>
   Things would get better. Penn State went to Miami and came home
with a much-needed victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we beat Miami, I felt like, well, maybe I know a little
bit about this game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions finished 8-2 that season, and Paterno hasn't looked
back since. He has produced five perfect seasons (1968, '69, '73,
'86, and '94) and won national championships in 1982 and '86. That
most recent unbeaten effort (12-0, including a Rose Bowl victory)
came just a year after Penn State made what many expected to be a
rocky entry into the Big Ten.
</P>
<P>
   As history beckons, some new neighbors are duly impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe is one of the living legends in the coaching profession,''
Ohio State coach John Cooper said. ``The thing that amazes me is
how long he's been able to last.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Joe pretty well personally. He's not only an
outstanding football coach; he's a great person. I'm very, very
happy for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan's Lloyd Carr, a longtime Bo Schembechler assistant,
sends congratulations, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can you say about Joe Paterno that hasn't already been
said?'' Carr asks. ``He's a legend in this game. He is going to be
remembered not only for the great teams and great players, but Joe
is going to be remembered as a great ambassador for college
football.''
</P>
<P>
   Enough, already, Paterno moans. What about Bowling Green? And
why all this talk about how he is going to be remembered?
</P>
<P>
   He isn't going anywhere. Not for a while, at least.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to coach four more years,'' he said. ``If I feel as
good as I do right now in two years, I might re-evaluate and say,
`Hey, I want to coach four more years.' If I don't, we'll work it
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm feeling great. I'm enjoying it. I can't think
of anything I'd rather do.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 49th season overall, Joe Paterno has been on the Penn
State coaching staff for more than half the games in school
history. As head coach, he has won a record 18 bowls, and no one
else has won all four of the traditional majors (Rose, Cotton,
Sugar and Orange), plus the Fiesta Bowl (where he is 6-0).
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, his players have won the Heisman and Outland
trophies, plus the Maxwell, O'Brien, Lombardi and Biletnikoff
awards.
</P>
<P>
   Once, in the early 1970s, Paterno considered leaving for the
NFL's Patriots, but ultimately Boston would be stood up again. A
legend later, he looks back on the path he has taken and marvels at
how blessed he has been.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been very, very fortunate in all the decisions I've made
in my life,'' he said. ``Where I went to school, deciding to take a
chance at coaching with Rip Engle before going to law school, the
selection of my wife (Sue, whom he married in 1962), the coaches
I've been around
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any regrets. I just worry once in a while that I
don't do enough. I get nervous wondering why everything has worked
out for me.''
</P>
<P>
   If everything goes to plan on Saturday, Paterno says he will
treat victory No. 300 as he has most of the previous 299.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some people over for dinner after most home games,''
he said. ``We have a good Italian meal for everybody. We'll have a
couple of laughs, hopefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``Win or lose, we'll have a good time.''

Market strong for McGwire memorabilia
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By MICHAEL MURPHY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Mark McGwire has said bye-bye to Roger Maris with his
major-league-record 62nd home run, and baseball merchandisers
everywhere are saying something else:
</P>
<P>
   Buy! Buy!
</P>
<P>
   Each crack of McGwire's bat is another ``ca-ching'' at the cash
register, and the spend doctors are working overtime to cash in on
the craze, especially since McGwire surpassed Maris Tuesday night
by cracking No. 62 against the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, MacMania is everywhere these days.
</P>
<P>
   Just about anything and everything imaginable is being packaged
for sale. Want a Mark McGwire T-shirt? Got it. Want a McGwire
jersey? Got it. Want a McGwire cap, pennant, baseball, keychain,
coffee mug, poster or bat? Got those, too. Even Waterford Crystal
is getting into the act, creating a special crystal baseball to
commemorate the event.
</P>
<P>
   But wait, there's more. Much more.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hottest items is from a company called Photo File,
which is offering a limited-edition photograph featuring McGwire,
Maris and Babe Ruth, all posing together thanks to computer
compositing. There are only 62,000 being produced, but don't expect
them _ or anything else with McGwire's name attached _ to be around
long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, anything associated with Mark McGwire is hot,''
said Ted Nelkin of HLT&AMP;T Sports, which deals with sports
collectibles. ``It does sell.''
</P>
<P>
   And sells well. In the time it takes to read this story,
thousands of dollars worth of McGwire memorabilia will be sold. Pro
Player, a sports-apparel company based in Hudson, N.H., estimates
it will sell an extra $2 million in McGwire-related merchandise
because of the record-breaking homer.
</P>
<P>
   How much is McGwire in demand? Get this: fans with apparently
more money than sense have actually called the St. Louis Cardinals'
Team Store asking for McGwire's used chewing gum and even a pair of
his underwear.
</P>
<P>
   With odd requests like those, it's no surprise the two biggest
manias of the year, McGwire and Beanie Babies, have collided
head-on. Athletic Marketing and Promotions (AMP) is offering a
McGwire Beanie, appropriately called the ``Bamm Beano.'' The purple
bear features McGwire's name and number 25 embroidered on the back
of the bear and his number on the chest.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Brubaker, who oversees operations at the Astros Team Store,
which stocks souvenirs at the Astrodome, laughed when he heard
about the McGwire Beanie Baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen that, but that would qualify as my oddest
(McGwire item),'' said Brubaker, laughing. ``I'll defer to that
one.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brubaker has seen just about everything else McGwire-related
and will have several items in stock for the series against the
Cardinals this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be quite candid, most of the thing we've been exposed to on
the marketplace has been _ I don't know if normal is the word _ but
very saleable,'' Brubaker said. ``Most of the things, I think, are
in very good taste. It's just a matter of what your fans are
looking for. What we find is the fans visiting the Astrodome aren't
maybe quite as rabid (about McGwire) as the fans who live in St.
Louis and have followed the Cardinals for years, or maybe even
those who have been following Mark McGwire for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whole, wider spectrum of things _ coins, medallions
and rings, for example. We had a gentleman in here the other day
who had a license to produce these things, but I didn't think that
somebody here is going to want to come in and spend $200 or $300 on
a ring to commemorate the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``But maybe in St. Louis they could sell a significant number of
them and make it worth their while. It becomes a matter of deciding
what you think your customers would want when they come in your
store.''
</P>
<P>
   What they want are the usual items _ pennants, jerseys, hats,
T-shirts, etc., all of which Brubaker will have in stock when
McGwire and Co. hit town Friday. Brubaker is expecting a weekend
like the one Three Rivers Stadium enjoyed when McGwire and the
Cardinals went to Pittsburgh for a recent series. Almost $40,000
worth of McGwire-related merchandise was snapped up in three days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gauging by the requests we've had, particularly the Cardinals'
last visit in, there seems to be an awful lot of fan interest in
some kind of memorabilia or something to commemorate the event,''
said Brubaker, who sells only items approved by Major League
Properties. ``Obviously, if he (had) hit the 62nd home run here, it
(would have had) a little bit of significance (sales-wise).
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been inundated with all kinds of artwork and samples and
things like that for things that are going to be done to
commemorate this. Basically as soon as the ball (left) the park,
those manufacturers started the presses running.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the fever surrounding McGwire not only
jump-starts the legitimate memorabilia business but the market in
bogus products as well. As the Cardinals slugger himself warns,
beware of autographed McGwire items, because chances are they're
fake.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every (real) autograph, there are probably 10,000
phonies,'' said McGwire, who refuses to accept money for autograph
signings. ``Anybody who advertises Mark McGwire things, I'd tell
people, `Never touch it.' There are scumbags out there who want to
make a dollar, and I hope they get caught. They say they're getting
it from me, and that's a total lie. It's sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is unscrupulous, but there is an amazing number of
people trying to make a buck off McGwire's incredible season.
McGwire is the pitch on television outlets like the Shop At Home
Network, which recently offered its ``Insane McGwire Package'' _ 62
McGwire trading cards, a vending box of cards and several wax
packs. All for only $699.
</P>
<P>
   There also are telephone auctions, like the one North Shore
Sports is running through Sports Collectors Digest, where items
such as McGwire's college jersey from Southern Cal, a 1984 Olympic
jersey, a 1986 Oakland A's rookie jersey, the 1988 World Series
jersey and 1997 Cardinals jersey are all up for bid, as well as
items like McGwire's lifetime pass to the Hall of Fame and various
cards, bats, hats and lithographs.
</P>
<P>
   Why the hysteria?
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing is perfect,'' Nelkin said. ``You had an icon like
Babe Ruth hit 60, then Roger Maris beat the record in 1961. You're
talking about all the right years and all the right names.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at 1961, you're talking about an age when the
dads of (today's) kids were teen-agers and were following baseball.
Now you have that relationship with the kids, where they're seeing
their childhood and their teen years again through their kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about memories.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
McGwire to continue assault without days off
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By NEIL HOHLFELD &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
The drama and feel-good celebration of No. 62 have come and gone,
but by no means is the 1998 home-run story over.
</P>
<P>
   And it won't be until the final home run is hit by either St.
Louis first baseman Mark McGwire, who broke Roger Maris'
single-season record with his 62nd Tuesday night, or Chicago right
fielder Sammy Sosa, who has 58 homers.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs pitcher Steve Trachsel, who gave up McGwire's 62nd home run
in St. Louis, said he thinks he will become a footnote in history
by the end of the season. The pitcher who will be forever
remembered, says Trachsel, is the one who allows the final homer to
either McGwire or Sosa, depending on which hitter leads the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think whoever gives up the last one is the one they're going
to be talking about,'' said Trachsel. ``This was the
record-breaker, but it's not going to be the record-setter.''
</P>
<P>
   That might be wishful thinking by Trachsel, but the Cardinals
have 17 games remaining this season, so McGwire will have plenty of
chances to keep adding to his record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'll finish the season without taking days off,'' said
McGwire, who went 0-for-2 Wednesday night against the Reds. ``I
feel pretty good, and that's the bottom line. I want to finish
strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because of what I've done doesn't mean I'll stop. There's
two weeks left in the season. As far as I'm concerned, I've got a
lot of work ahead of me.''
</P>
<P>
   How many more home runs McGwire hits _ or how many Sosa hits, if
he gets hot again _ will determine the number future power hitters
will have to shoot for. One thing seems certain: the bar will be
quite higher than it was for the last two hitters who broke the
power mark.
</P>
<P>
   In 1927, when Babe Ruth hit 60 home runs, he topped his record
of 59 that had been set in 1921. In 1961, when Maris broke Ruth's
record, he hit No. 61 on the final day of the season to barely ease
past Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   This season, McGwire could add another half dozen or so home
runs and could even threaten the 70 home-run barrier, a number that
was all but unthinkable throughout baseball history. If McGwire
does that, his record figures to stay on the books a long time.
Ruth's record stood for 34 years, Maris' mark for 37.
</P>
<P>
   Reds manager Jack McKeon was asked how long he thought McGwire's
record would stand if the Cardinals basher reached the mid-60 range
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it could take 50 years,'' said McKeon. ``That's a lot
of home runs you're talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   In the immediate future, the status of baseball looks far
brighter than it did a mere four years ago. In 1994, a strike wiped
out the playoffs and World Series and caused a severe backlash
among fans.
</P>
<P>
   Doomsayers predicted the demise of baseball, and it seemed the
sport would be hard-pressed to regain the popularity it once held.
However, after a summer of being revived by the power of McGwire
and Sosa and also the way they handled the intense glare during
their chase of Maris' record, it is now safe to call baseball the
national pastime and not draw guffaws.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will tell you this,'' McGwire said after hitting No. 62.
``The whole country has been involved in this. I think since after
the All-Star break, everybody's been involved, everywhere we went.
It's really been amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of a few midseason meltdowns with the media,
McGwire has been just what the sport needed to shine its image. His
relationships with his 10-year-old son, Matthew, with Sosa and with
the family of Maris, who died in 1985 at the age of 51, were the
stuff of storybooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been saying that this is bringing the country
together,'' said McGwire. ``I don't know, but if that's the case,
so be it. I am happy to have a part in bringing the country
together. I think this puts baseball back on the map as far as
America's pastime. You just look at everybody who comes out to the
ballparks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a great, great time, and it's not over yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Not by a long shot _ or a few more long home runs.

AT MURDER ARRAIGNMENT, KIN DEMAND VICTIMS' REMAINS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. _ As court officers tried to silence them,
anguished relatives of two of the eight women whose bodies were
unearthed last week in a squalid family home here interrupted the
arraignment of the murder suspect Wednesday, demanding that their
kin be released for funerals without undergoing a new round of
autopsies requested by defense lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That man had my mother's body for three months,'' shouted
Heidi Cramer, the daughter of one of the slain women, as the
suspect, Kendall Francois, stared tensely ahead and a brawny court
officer loomed over her. ``He's not going to have her for another
day.''
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic outburst came on a day when District Attorney
William Grady disclosed new details about the case, including the
finding that a Poughkeepsie police officer visited Francois' house
four or five months ago, before three of the victims were killed.
Grady said the officer had noticed a foul odor in the house, but
had assumed that it came from the garbage and pet excrement that
littered the house.
</P>
<P>
   Grady also said that a few months before police visited
Francois, they had given him a lie-detector test. They said he
passed the test, in which they asked about the missing women.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Francois' arrest last week, Grady and police were on
the defensive as families of the missing women _ most of them
prostitutes _ questioned why it was taking police so long to find
them. The families suggested that police would have been more
aggressive if the victims had been more prestigious.
</P>
<P>
   After Francois was arrested, two prostitutes said that as early
as November 1996 they had specifically identified Francois to
police as the man who had tried to strangle them, but that little
was done with their information.
</P>
<P>
   Grady repeated Wednesday what he said last week, that both
prostitutes waited too long to report their attacks and made it
difficult to file a timely application for a search warrant of
Francois' house. The prostitutes, he said, also ``refused to
cooperate'' further with the investigation along.
</P>
<P>
   The outburst in court Wednesday seemed to reflect the
frustration many of the relatives have felt with the pace of the
investigation into the disappearances of eight women in two years'
time and the week it has taken to search for, examine and identify
the corpses. One family _ that of the most recently slain victim,
Catina Newmaster _ announced a funeral for Wednesday only to be
told on Sunday that the defense plan to ask for second autopsies
might mean they would have to postpone the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The courtroom drama began when Kendall, a 6-foot 4-inch,
300-pound man with the build of a football guard, walked into the
courtroom with a thin smile on his lips to be arraigned on a single
charge of second-degree murder in the death of Ms. Newmaster.
Barbara Perry, the mother of Ms. Newmaster, let out a soft moan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my God,'' she said, loud enough for much of the court to
hear. She sobbed quietly as Judge Thomas Dolan made sure that
Francois understood the charge against him.
</P>
<P>
   Francois pleaded not guilty and bail was denied without much
argument, but then, Francois' lawyer, Randolph Treece, asked that
his own experts be allowed to perform a second round of autopsies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the body now,'' shouted Ms. Cramer, 29, the daughter
of Sandra Jean French, 51, who disappeared last June and whose body
was found in Francois' house. ``This is wrong! This is wrong!''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Huckell, Ms. Newmaster's uncle, stood up at his seat across
the aisle and also demanded the return of the bodies for burial.
</P>
<P>
   Court officers walked into the courtroom audience. One grabbed
Ms. Cramer's arm and tried to eject her, but then backed off. But
soon the courtroom quieted down and Dolan granted the request for a
second series of autopsies by a defense pathologist, but ordered
that they be done quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Treece, in an interview, criticized Grady's office for not
inviting a defense expert to the first autopsies. Grady said that
Treece should have asked. He also said that if the second round of
autopsies is not completed by Friday morning, he would ask that the
judge order the bodies released.
</P>
<P>
   Treece is a lawyer in the state's capital defender's office,
which is involved in cases involving a possible execution.

MARK MCGWIRE: FRIENDSHIP, FAMILY AND FANS KEPT HIM ON ROAD TO
HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>

 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ As he lay on the grass at Wrigley Field, stretching
during pregame exercises with his St. Louis teammates, Mark McGwire
was not the happiest of baseball players.
</P>
<P>
   It was late in the afternoon of Aug. 18, and McGwire had not, in
two or three weeks, had much to laugh about. His chase of Roger
Maris single-season home run record had bogged down _ he had hit
only two home runs since July 28 _ he was tired and he was becoming
testy over the smothering attention he was receiving and the
attempts some people were making to pry into his personal life.
</P>
<P>
   ``People wanted to get more, they wanted to keep finding out
stuff,'' Tony LaRussa, the St. Louis manager, recalling the
travails that engulfed his long-time star, whom he also managed in
Oakland. ``They started to ask questions about his personal life.
He got calls from home saying that people were trying to talk to
people. He felt that was out of bounds. What does that have to do
with anything? He got teed off. That's when he was a little edgy.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire had 47 home runs and still had 39 games in which to hit
the 15 he needed to break Maris' record. But if his drought
continued much longer, his chances could be in jeopardy, and the
scintillating race with Sammy Sosa that had seized the nation's
interest and energized the sport could fizzle.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Cardinals stretched outside their dugout in Chicago
that day, a member of the Cubs approached McGwire. And simply by
taking a few steps toward him, however, Sosa started a stampede.
``The swarm of photographers when Sammy came over was amazing,''
McGwire said. ``I've never seen anything like it. We just hugged
each other. We had to laugh. How can you not laugh about that?''
</P>
<P>
   It was only a brief, seemingly innocent interlude, but the
impromptu embrace appeared to relax McGwire, and quite likely
played a pivotal role in his mad dash to No. 62. Beginning the next
day, McGwire unleashed a torrent of 15 home runs in a 22-game span
that catapulted him into history. He arrived there Tuesday night
when he swatted the record-setting home run against Steve Trachsel
of the Chicago Cubs at Busch Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   That moment in Chicago was only one vignette in a summer tale of
a man who held up, and performed, under unceasing pressure and
scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, punctuating the story's unfolding chapters with bursts
of home runs, found a way to excel even on a team whose overall
performance was disturbingly disappointing, and he prevailed
despite becoming, for several weeks, the focal point of a heated
debate over the use of potentially performance-enhancing
substances.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, McGwire helped elevate interest in a tarnished
sport; provided financial windfalls for opposing teams who sold out
their stadiums when he came through; and turned the routine of
batting practice into a quirky carnival, drawing those who wanted
to be awed.
</P>
<P>
   But the St. Louis first baseman also traveled a very personal
journey, taking strength from visits with mentors and old friends,
his child and parents, and forging new, deeply felt relationships
with Sosa and the Maris family.
</P>
<P>
   The story's final plot line appears to have been cemented in
Chicago in August. Sosa, who unlike McGwire was new to the rarefied
air of the 50-homer plateau, had handled the attention with
remarkable ease, humor and grace, and his attitude might have
rubbed off on McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   Tied at the time with 47 home runs, Sosa snatched the lead in
the Aug. 19 game in Chicago by hitting his 48th home run in the
fifth inning. It was the first, and so far, only time Sosa led
McGwire, and the Cubs right fielder would hold that lead for less
than three innings.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth inning, McGwire hit his 48th, then connected again
in the 10th for No. 49 and a lead he has yet to relinquish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The season is a grind, with all the travel, and your body goes
through a tired period,'' McGwire said of his August slump. ``This
happens every season, but when it happened this year _ I hadn't hit
a homer in 30 at-bats _ reporters were wondering, `What's wrong
with Mark McGwire?' But nobody asked me. And that's when I got
peeved at some of the reporters. I know I came off testy, but the
whole thing got blown out of proportion.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire sensed even before he hit 48 and 49 that they were
coming. He got a clue, he said, from his first two times at bat in
that game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me I was getting really close,'' he related. ``I
just missed one my first at-bat and the second one I just missed it
and popped it straight up in the infield. I've played this game
long enough to know it's just a matter of time, a matter of
millimeters.'
</P>
<P>
   He swatted No. 50 at Shea Stadium in New York the next day in
the first game of the first of two consecutive doubleheaders
against the Mets. With his swing against Willie Blair, McGwire
became the first player in history to hit 50 home runs in three
successive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my first at-bat, it was tough to see,'' McGwire said.
``Everybody was having trouble seeing because of the shadows. ``But
I felt good my second at-bat. He threw me a slider down and I went
down and got it. It was almost like a golf shot. I didn't think it
had enough to go out. I thought that the wind would knock it
down.''
</P>
<P>
   La Russa said : ``Fifty was a very important number for him.
Getting to 50 relaxed him more than anything.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire had maintained that no one should talk about the home
run record until a player had 50 home runs at the start of
September. He was 11 days early. ``I'd have to say I do have a
shot,'' he concluded then.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire had in the previous two seasons served notice that he
could be a threat to the record. He hit 52 home runs in 1996 and 58
last season, joining Babe Ruth as the only players who reached 50
in two successive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Topping 61, then, was the talk of spring training, and McGwire
instantly justified the questions he had quickly tired of. He hit
one home run in each of the team's first four games.
</P>
<P>
   But the early weeks of the season did not provide hints of the
race to come between McGwire and Sosa, a race that came to both
push McGwire and more broadly define the assault on Maris' record.
On May 24 McGwire had 24 home runs, Sosa only nine. Ken Griffey Jr.
and Alex Rodriguez of Seattle were closer to McGwire with 18 each.
</P>
<P>
   But beginning May 25, Sosa smacked 21 home runs in his next 22
games, a tear that took him to June 21 and slashed McGwire's lead
to only 33-30. The streak established Sosa as a legitimate
challenger to the record and filled him with confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, though, McGwire downplayed any sense of a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no competition,'' McGwire said late in the season. ``I
don't know where this competition got started. It is so good, what
is going on right now, for the game of baseball. It just happens to
be the home runs and what he and I are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Competition or not, McGwire and Sosa frequently homered on the
same day, with McGwire more often than not responding to a Sosa
initiative. From June 24 through last Saturday, they hit home runs
on the same day 13 times _ a total of 16 for McGwire and 13 for
Sosa.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sosa was not the only distraction McGwire had to deal with. In
August, a reporter standing in a group interviewing him after a
game noticed a bottle in his locker. It contained
testosterone-producing pills called androstenedione, a substance
banned by other sports organizations, but not by baseball. The
ensuing media coverage triggered a debate over McGwire's use of the
pills and threatened to tarnish the record he would set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel it might help make me stronger,'' said McGwire, who had
been angered by the disclosure, ``and I want to do whatever I can
to strengthen my back, which I've had problems with through the
years.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's rationale did not convince everyone. But whether it
was luck or the help of the supplement, McGwire remained healthy
throughout the season, a development that became critical in his
march toward the record. Robbed of numerous games in several
earlier seasons because of injuries, McGwire suffered no physical
setback worse than an episode with his back that forced him to miss
three games in Los Angeles the first week of June.
</P>
<P>
   Free of injury, and undeterred by the furor over his use of the
pills, McGwire went on to generate a new phenomenon in baseball _
the curtain call on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Most strikingly, in Pittsburgh in August, McGwire's presence
created two successive sellouts in a usually abandoned stadium. The
successive sellouts were the first during the regular season since
the Pirates began playing in Three Rivers Stadium in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting a home run in each game (Nos. 52 and 53), McGwire was
saluted by standing ovations and demands for a curtain call.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept clapping for about a minute so I ducked my head out
and gave them a wave,'' he said after the first curtain call. ``I
hope the Pirates didn't mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The public ovations McGwire encountered were also bolstered by
more private moments during his pursuit. In Florida in late August,
McGwire had a visit from an old friend, Doug Rader, who had been
the hitting coach in Oakland for part of the time that McGwire
played with the Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1991,'' said LaRussa, under whom Rader worked, ``Mark hit
.201 and in 1992 Doug came to Oakland and Mark gives him credit for
helping him get his career turned around. He laid a lot of stuff
out for Mark and got him back on target.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first game against the Marlins, McGwire struck out twice
and didn't get a hit in three at-bats. Rader, who is retired from
baseball, visited McGwire before the second game. McGwire,
delighted to see Rader, eagerly embraced him and chatted with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's brutal what he's going through,'' Rader said. ``But he's
a fine, fine man and he has his mental house in order.''
</P>
<P>
   LaRussa thought the visit gave McGwire a spark. ``Mark said he
definitely was excited to see Doug,'' the manager said.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh inning of the game, McGwire clouted his 56th home
run against Livan Hernandez, last year's World Series hero, tying
Hack Wilson's 68-year-old National League record.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in the dugout, Dave Parker, the Cardinals' hitting coach,
walked over to McGwire. ``Now that you've tied Hack,'' Parker told
him, ``you might as well break it your next at-bat.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitting against Don Pall, a journeyman relief pitcher, in the
ninth inning, McGwire did precisely that.
</P>
<P>
   The next night McGwire hit No. 58 against Brian Edmondson in the
seventh inning. The pitch, McGwire said later, was about three
inches off the ground. ``I think I amazed myself that I golfed it
off the ground,'' he remarked.
</P>
<P>
   ``How'd you hit that pitch?'' Randy Knorr, the Marlins' catcher,
asked McGwire when he stepped into the batter's box to face Rob
Stanifer in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' the remarkable McGwire said and then hit No.
59.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier that day, Sosa had hit his 56th home run at Wrigley
against Jason Bere of Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   But as he had done for weeks, McGwire responded to the challenge
and created an an even larger lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark's the man,'' Sosa said, sounding the mantra. But Sosa was
not so awed by ``the man'' that he withered away in the record
chase. The home runs in Pittsburgh against Jason Schmidt and Sean
Lawrence gave him 58.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's having a magical year,'' McGwire said of his friendly
rival. ``I root him on like everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   But before Sosa connected for No. 58 last Saturday night,
McGwire lofted one of his typical fly balls into the left field
stands at Busch Stadium that afternoon, a first-inning shot on a
2-0 fastball from Dennis Reyes.
</P>
<P>
   When the ball descended into the stands, McGwire matched Babe
Ruth's legendary 60 and became only the third player to hit 60 home
runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Geez,'' the redheaded McGwire stammered, ``I mean, geez, Babe
Ruth. What can you say? Geez. You're almost speechless when people
put your name alongside his name.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire didn't remain alongside Ruth for long. Two days later,
with the Cubs in town and Sosa in right field, McGwire drove
another baseball beyond the left field fence, this time on a 1-1
fastball from Mike Morgan in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   When the ball cleared the fence, McGwire was even with Roger
Maris and only one swing away from eclipsing him, too.
</P>
<P>
   The total eclipse came the following night, a short arc of a
home run just over the left-field fence. The record was McGwire's _
both to defend and enlarge upon. &QL;

EDITORIAL: GLIMMER OF A WEST BANK DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Sept. 10:
</P>
<P>
   The return of an American mediator to the Middle East Wednesday
after a four-month absence signals that the long stalemate between
Israel and the Palestinians may be nearing an end. The two sides
have made progress this summer on arranging the transfer of
another13 percent of the West Bank to full or partial Palestinian
control. Though differences remain, particularly involving security
matters, there is now a fair chance the American envoy, Dennis
Ross, can help narrow the gap.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bill Clinton's political problems have diminished
American leverage, Washington remains an important factor in
Mideast peacemaking. But reviving the Oslo peace agreement is
something American officials cannot do themselves. Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, must
overcome their mutual distrust.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators have worked out an arrangement for Israel to pull
back from a full 13 percent of the territory, as the Palestinians
had demanded. But at Israeli insistence, part of the newly
transferred land would be declared a nature reserve _ not for
ecological reasons, but to prevent new construction. Keeping this
area undeveloped would ease the security fears of nearby Israeli
settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Palestinian security failures and the provocative
rhetoric of Palestinian officials, many Israelis have lost
confidence in Arafat's assurances. Before going ahead with the 13
percent withdrawal, the Netanyahu government seeks new guarantees
that the Palestinians will turn over illegally held weapons and
terrorist suspects wanted by Israel. Arafat, who thought the Oslo
agreements promised him a more generous West Bank withdrawal at a
much earlier date, insists that any transfer of weapons or
terrorist suspects be done through American intermediaries.
</P>
<P>
   The long impasse has weakened Washington's position throughout
the Mideast. Efforts to disarm and contain Saddam Hussein, thwart
terrorism and promote trade and investment across the region could
all be helped if the Israelis and Palestinians showed new progress
in settling their conflict.

PARCELLS GETS UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ The Jets are down to five linebackers, coach
Bill Parcells is unhappy about tackling by two of them and he needs
better production from his special teams. So he cornered some of
the guilty parties Wednesday for private talks to impress on them
the need to improve. ``I'm trying to do this in a nice, quiet,
communicative way,'' Parcells said after he talked with each
player, separately, in his office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nice and quiet?'' said Ray Lucas, a special-teams player and
one of those whom Parcells collared. ``If he does it even quieter
than that, then we'll be in big trouble. This was a last chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Chad Cascadden was one of the linebackers Parcells singled out.
Cascadden produced only two tackles after replacing the injured
James Farrior in the fourth quarter of the Jets' season-opening
overtime loss to the San Francisco 49ers. Dwayne Gordon, a backup
linebacker and special-teams player, who also had only two tackles,
was taken aside, too. Tight end Fred Baxter, an important
special-teams contributor, also said he had a conversation with the
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't smiling,'' Cascadden said after his meeting with
Parcells. ``I've got to step up my play because of the linebacker
situation. This is what they're paying me for.'' He signed a
three-year deal for $2.3 million as a backup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite honestly, I wasn't myself this weekend,'' Gordon said.
``Last year I did a lot of double-digit tackling. We had a
conversation. He talked to me about me being more productive on the
defensive end of things. I was in on 30 plays and only made two
tackles. And on special teams, I've got to do what I did last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon had been among the Jets' leading tacklers on special
teams until midway through last season, when he replaced the
injured Pepper Johnson as the starting middle linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   This season, injuries have again depleted the Jets, whose
linebacking unit is the one most unsettled in the wake of the
gallant but troubling 36-30 loss to the 49ers. The Jets are now
preparing to face the Baltimore Ravens Sunday at the Meadowlands.
``The players I met with are those who performed well for us last
year, and I want to get back to that level,'' Parcells said. ``They
have to understand more is expected of them this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Farrior will be lost for at least two games because of a
sprained right knee. He joins the previously injured starter Marvin
Jones (left knee), who is out for the year. And a rookie whom
Parcells had plans for, Casey Dailey, is also out for the season
with a broken foot.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells seemed unsure at Wednesday's news conference about how
he would deploy his linebackers against the Ravens. He seemed to be
leaning toward bringing in Gordon on the weakside for Cascadden. In
any event, with only five linebackers, there is going to be
considerable movement with players coming in and out, and shifting
sides. Johnson in the middle, Mo Lewis on the strongside and his
backup, Bryan Cox, who also plays in passing situations, complete
the unit.
</P>
<P>
   But even with this depleted crew, Parcells must still use
Cascadden and Gordon on special teams. They are valuable there.
</P>
<P>
   Cascadden has been a special-teams star for three years, while
Gordon was one of that unit's best before becoming a full-time
player last year. But the special teams had problems in San
Francisco, giving up an 18-yard punt return as well as a 33-yard
kickoff return.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, they will be trying to run down the Ravens' Jermaine
Lewis, who had a 97-yard punt return in the teams' preseason
meeting last month. The Ravens went on to a 33-0 victory. ``He said
I played an important role last year,'' Baxter said of his talk
with Parcells, ``and he wanted me to step it up on offense and
specials.''
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   _ Jim Harbaugh, the Ravens' quarterback, said Wednesday that he
was going to an acupuncturist for his injured right ring finger.
``I don't care how much it hurts, the coaches will have to make the
decision on whether I play,'' said Harbaugh, who was hurt in last
Sunday's loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers. He left Wednesday's
practice and was replaced by Eric Zeier. Harbaugh said his
situation was day to day.
</P>
<P>
   _ Although right tackle Jason Fabini has a broken bone in a
right finger, and is wearing a huge cast, he is not on the injury
list. Parcells said, ``There's a 100-percent chance he'll play.''
The only Jet on the list is running back Leon Johnson, who has a
bruised quadriceps. He is listed as probable.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr on
Wednesday sent to Congress a report that prosecutors said contained
``substantial and credible information that may constitute grounds
for impeachment'' of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The material, including reams of grand jury transcripts and
audio tapes, arrived at the Capitol four years after Starr took on
the investigation of Clinton's role in failed land deals in
Arkansas, and eight months after his inquiry was expanded to
include accusations that he tried to cover up a sexual relationship
with a White House intern, Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The delivery of two duplicate, sealed 18-box sets of information
caught Congress by surprise, arriving in two vans late in the
afternoon on 15 minutes' notice.
</P>
<P>
   The boxes were promptly moved to the nearby Gerald R. Ford House
Office Building, where they were put under guard in the custody of
the sergeant-of-arms and the Capitol Police. As a security measure,
the locks had been changed on the storage room in the last few
days.
</P>
<P>
   Senior members of Congress said after an emergency meeting
Wednesday night that the House could make the report public by
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The House leaders, just back from recess, started the day with a
rare bipartisan meeting to set procedures for deciding whether to
begin the first impeachment proceedings against a president since
the Watergate inquiry that led to the resignation of President
Richard M. Nixon in August 1974.
</P>
<P>
   But their deliberations were hastened when the report arrived
mid-afternoon, with Charles Bakaly, Starr's spokesman, declaring:
``The office has fulfilled its duty under the law. Responsibility
for the information that we have transmitted Wednesday and for any
further actions now lies with the Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Mobs of reporters, lawmakers and tourists looked on as Bakaly
held a short news conference at the East Front of the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly would not elaborate on the contents of the 445-page
report and declined to say whether it ranged beyond the Lewinsky
matter.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y., the chairman of the House Rules
Committee, said it contained a 140-page section outlining possible
grounds for impeachment. Lawyers familiar with Starr's plans said
he was trying to prove perjury, obstruction of justice and abuse of
power by Clinton in his effort to conceal his relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   They said the prosecutor would almost certainly say that Clinton
lied under oath in January, during a deposition in the sexual
harassment lawsuit by Paula Jones, when he denied having had a
sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. The lawyers said the report
would also contain embarrassing details of his conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly said the independent counsel's investigation was
continuing. The grand jury hearing the Lewinsky matter is to meet
again Thursday, and according to lawyers familiar with Starr's
plans is expected to investigate the actions of lesser Clinton
associates.
</P>
<P>
   With his presidency in peril, Clinton began the day trying to
appease leading Democrats. Described as sad, somber and choked up,
Clinton offered emotional apologies Wednesday morning to senior
House Democrats for his liaison with Ms. Lewinsky and seven months
of denials.
</P>
<P>
   One Democrat told the president that he had lost the trust of
the American people and the Congress. Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich.,
the House minority whip, said Democrats told Clinton he ``needed to
be out in the country'' and apologizing, ``as difficult as it will
be.''
</P>
<P>
   By mid-day, Clinton was in Orlando on a fund-raising trip, where
he made a public display of contrition. It contrasted sharply with
his defiant television address on Aug. 17 when he first
acknowledged the relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. On that day, hours
after testifying to a grand jury, Clinton acknowledged an
``inappropriate relationship'' with Ms. Lewinsky, which he had
denied for seven months. He has been criticized for failing to
apologize in that address.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let my family down and I let this country down, but I am
trying to make it right,'' Clinton said Wednesday in Orlando. ``I
am determined never to let anything like that happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   As the president planned a series of public events this week,
his strategists have been preparing for the delivery of Starr's
report to the Hill. After unsuccessfully seeking an advance copy of
the report, David Kendall, the president's private lawyer, was
planning to go to court to challenge the format and the contents of
Starr's report. The swift shipment of the report to the Capitol
pre-empted such a move.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the White House late Wednesday afternoon, Kendall
characterized Starr's report as one-sided.
</P>
<P>
   The voluminous materials, Kendall said, ``represent only the
prosecutor's allegations, allegations that we have been denied a
chance to review.'' He added, ``But we do know this: There is no
basis for impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Constitution, Congress has the power to impeach the
president for treason, bribery or ``other high crimes and
misdemeanors.'' The House acts as the prosecutor and must initiate
any impeachment proceedings. The Senate is the jury, and must take
a two-thirds vote to remove a president.
</P>
<P>
   No president has faced such an inquiry since the Watergate
scandal, when the House Judiciary Committee approved three articles
of impeachment against Nixon. He resigned in 1974 before a full
impeachment vote.
</P>
<P>
   The House impeached President Andrew Johnson in 1868, but the
Senate fell one vote short of convicting him.
</P>
<P>
   Because the House has no standing rules for handling
impeachment, House leaders had just begun to negotiate procedures
when Starr caught them by surprise..
</P>
<P>
   As the vans carrying the boxes arrived at the Capitol,
Republican leaders were gathered across the street in front of the
Library of Congress for a news conference. Even as the vans were
pulling up, House Speaker Newt Gingrich was saying he could not
confirm their arrival.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said no House member would have access to the report
until the House passed a resolution, which was being drafted
through the night.
</P>
<P>
   As the rapid-fire events hurtled forward, members of Congress
seemed acutely aware of the historic responsibility they faced.
Earlier in the day, Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., the chamber's
unofficial historian, compared Clinton with Nixon in his tactics of
attack and delay: ``Many of the mistakes that President Nixon made
are being made all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   But Byrd pleaded from the Senate floor that Congress practice
restraint. ``If sometime in the future, the American people should
come to believe that this president or any other president has been
driven out of office for what they may perceive to be political
reasons,'' Byrd said, ``their wrath will fall on those who jumped
to judgment prematurely.''
</P>
<P>
   After their own morning meeting Gingrich and House Minority
Leader Dick Gephardt put aside their usual partisanship, to answer
questions side by side in Gingrich's suite.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt called impeachment, the gravest task facing Congress
next to declaring war. And Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the chairman of
the House Judiciary Committee, which oversees impeachment, called
the decision facing the House an ``exercise in individual
conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich bristled when one reporter tried to ask whether
lawmakers could ignore the upcoming midterm elections as they weigh
the president's fate. ``Yes,'' he interrupted. ``yes, yes, yes,
yes.''
</P>
<P>
   The report to Congress culminated years of investigations into
Clinton that began on Jan. 12, 1994, under Robert Fiske, and then
was continued by Starr, who was named by a three-judge panel on
Aug. 5, 1994. Starr's report has a 25-page introduction, a 280-page
narrative of events, and a 140-page section laying out possible
grounds for impeachment. Attached to the report are six three-ring
binders of 2,000 pages of additional materials.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen boxes more contain audio and video tapes and
transcripts including the president's testimony to the grand jury
and Ms. Lewinsky's description of her relationship with the
president, secretly tape recorded by Linda Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   An official familiar with the report said Starr also sent
Congress, a summary of the Paula Jones case, principles and
theories of impeachment, and White House telephone records. In his
formal referral letter, Starr pleaded with lawmakers to treat as
confidential ``information of a personal nature'' contained in
supporting materials with the report.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night Gingrich, Gephardt and some key lieutenants
huddled in another meeting trying to resolve differences over
procedures for their inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon said afterward that the full House would probably vote
Friday on a resolution that would allow the immediate release of
the report. Another 2,000 pages of appendices will be screened to
see what could be released.
</P>
<P>
   A final decision on the broad rules of the inquiry was put off
to next week. Solomon said he expected the Judiciary Committee and
the full House to decide by year's end whether to begin a
full-scale impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde on Wednesday vowed that ``I will not condone, nor
participate in, a political witch hunt. If the evidence does not
justify a full impeachment investigation, I will not recommend one
to the House.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt appealed Wednesday for the president and his lawyer to
have time to respond to Starr's report before it was released, but
the Republicans were not expected to agree.
</P>
<P>
   After Gephardt's request Gingrich, according to several
congressional aides, lectured Democrats about his own treatment
when he was censured and fined $300,000 by the House on ethic
charges. But he said that despite his own searing experienc, he
would protect the rights of the president.

Corp. of Fort Lauderdale, Fla. For 18 months, the dealers had seen
nothing but pictures of a quickly changing mix of vehicles, but
now, they thought, they were moments away from the real thing. Not
that every Eurasia dealer had waited patiently. ``I think it was a

will leave quaint new houses named for Illinois settlers to partake
in a novel suburban ritual: burning the prairie. The maverick 3
1/2-year-old development is the first major prairie reconstruction

ruthlessly. But any similarity between him and them ends right
about the point where Holtzman _ during an afternoon spent scouting
projects for the magazine _ pauses outside a limestone-faced
maisonette on the Upper East Side where, he said, the writer
William F. Buckley lives. Holtzman has an outsider's view of decor
_ in this case, literally. Nose to the window, he contemplated how

the same as watching a chef pour Cheeze Whiz over a plate of
quenelles. Creative, you think, but alarmingly tacky. But what Ms.

   INSTANT-IVY (Undated) _ Not since the 1920s has the New York
region witnessed estate-building on the scale and pace of the late

are crowding the suburbs; they're serious turn-of-the-21st-century
manor houses of 15,000, 25,000 and 40,000 squre feet and more. One
problem with the new estates, however, is that they seem so, well,
new. Because, as more and more well-heeled homeowners are
discovering, you can simply pay architects, contractors and
landscapers to make the places look as if they've been there
forever. One popular 1990s makeover is instant ivy implants. By Tom
Connor.

FATE OF YOUNG STARS AT HEART OF LOCKOUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two young stars whose future is at the heart of the
dispute between the National Basketball Association and its players
strolled into Madison Square Garden Wednesday night, locked out by
the NBA but ready to play.
</P>
<P>
   Stephon Marbury and Kevin Garnett, who could determine the
future success of the Minnesota Timberwolves, if not the league,
were in town for the New York All-Star Basketball Classic, a
fund-raiser for Wheelchair Charities.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury and Garnett, who played on opposite sides Wednesday
night, have at least one more season together in Minnesota. But
they could be split up in 1999. Neither player would discuss the
possible breakup, saying that they were ``only thinking about
basketball.'' But the team owners who pay them definitely have it
on their minds. One reason the owners locked the players out on
July 1 was contracts like the one worth $126 million over seven
years that Garnett signed before last season.
</P>
<P>
   Garnett, a 22-year-old forward drafted out of high school,
capitalized on a clause in the collective bargaining agreement
known as the Larry Bird exception, which allows teams to pay as
much as they want to free agents who have been with them for at
least three years, regardless of the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   While the owners and players are divided on many issues, the one
most important to both is the Bird exception: The owners want to do
away with it, and the players want to keep it. The owners believe
that salaries like Garnett's handcuff a franchise, making it
difficult to sign other players, especially when a team has two
players as talented and marketable as Garnett and Marbury.
</P>
<P>
   The players, on the other hand, point to the league's recent
three-year, $2.6 billion television deal with NBC, as well as other
signs of prosperity, as evidence that the NBA can afford to give
nine-figure contracts to its players. Even so, the players
understand the quandary that a team such as Minnesota is in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to take anything away from Kevin Garnett, but it's obvious
that if you give $100 million to player X and player Y wants that
much, how much do you give him?'' Boston Celtics point guard Kenny
Anderson said. ``If you give him $100 million, what are you going
to give to your role players?''
</P>
<P>
   People close to Marbury say he will ask the Timberwolves for a
seven-year contract worth $128 million in the shortened signing
period that will take place when the lockout ends. If the
Timberwolves give him that much money, they will almost certainly
have to say goodbye to the free agent Tom Gugliotta, an all-star
forward, and will have a tough time signing a decent supporting
cast for their two stars. If they don't sign Marbury, they will
lose one of the league's best young players and their chance to be
a dominant team.
</P>
<P>
   Though his contract has placed the Timberwolves in a difficult
position, Garnett isn't apologizing. ``I don't think that way,'' he
said before Wednesday night's game. ``I only think positively.
People can't be mad at me. I had an opportunity, and I took full
advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Marbury probably plans to do the same, but said he was not
thinking about leaving Minnesota, even for New York, his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy playing in Minnesota,'' Marbury said when asked
about becoming a Knick. ``I'm not even about to start that one.''

YANKS CLINCH DIVISION WITH 7-5 WIN OVER RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Ball in hand, Jorge Posada waited on the mound for the
Yankees' closer, Mariano Rivera, to jog in from the bullpen. With
the Yankees three outs from a division title, the visitors' dugout
was overflowing with players poised to run on the field and
celebrate a summer of excellence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's finish this,'' Posada said to Rivera, pounding the ball
into the pitcher's glove. ``Let's do this right now.''
</P>
<P>
   And when John Valentin grounded out to complete the Yankees' 7-5
victory over the Red Sox, first baseman Tino Martinez thrust an arm
into the air and the Yankees celebrated, more than they probably
thought they would, after running away with the American League
East.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Yankees clinched a division championship on
the road, on Oct. 2, 1978, a light hitter named Bucky Dent played
shortstop. Dent lofted a three-run homer here that day and the
Yankees went crazy, wildly shouting in the eerie silence of Fenway
Park, at the end of a memorable race. This was not quite so
suspenseful.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are 102-41 and lead the Red Sox by 20{ games,
matching the biggest lead in club history, set in 1941. The Yankees
clinched on the earliest date in their history since the advent of
division play in 1969. The '41 Yankees clinched the American League
pennant on Sept. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, they hugged and high-fived on the field,
congregating between the mound and second base. But the real mayhem
started when they retreated to the visitors' clubhouse, where all
the walls were covered with plastic and five cases of Champagne
awaited dispersal.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez sprayed the pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre with the
bubbly. Posada poured a bottle of beer down the back of shortstop
Derek Jeter, who slugged two home runs. Orlando Hernandez flicked
suds on Chuck Knoblauch. Tim Raines and Darryl Strawberry, players
nearing the end of their careers, smoked cigars together. Don
Zimmer, the bench coach, hid in Manager Joe Torre's office, knowing
he would be a prime target for Champagne spray if he were to
emerge.
</P>
<P>
   They were all happy, but as if programmed, they all repeated the
same mantra. ``This is our goal, we wanted to win the AL East,''
Jeter said. ``We can celebrate for a day, but now our goal is to
win the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Torre: ``Everybody realizes you can only get just so
excited with this. But we can take a day and enjoy this.''
</P>
<P>
   The players all probably realized but refused to acknowledge
what everybody in baseball thought in June, that the Yankees would
run away with the division. Torre, however, felt strongly that they
deserved to celebrate. He met with the players before the game and
suggested that when they clinched the division, they should be
careful. Please don't hurt each other, but enjoy it, he told the
Yankees. You earned it.
</P>
<P>
   Some poor teams play above expectations, some good teams don't
reach expectations, but the Yankees accomplished what only a few
teams in history have. They are a collection of superb players who
have played extremely hard and maintained peak concentration over
the long, hot summer. They are a great team that has overachieved.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees lost their first three games of the season,
prompting an intense team meeting in Seattle before a game against
the Mariners April 7. The Yankees won that night and won 21 of the
23 games that followed, launching themselves into the record books.
In winning their seventh East Division title, the Yankees are on a
pace to win 116 games and match the major league single-season
record for victories.
</P>
<P>
   Their inevitable clinching celebration nearly was postponed
another night, even after they took a big early lead. The Yankees
exploded against Tim Wakefield, Boston's knuckleballing starting
pitcher. Jeter bashed a 418-foot home run to center in the first
inning, and two innings later he slugged another, to about the same
spot but not quite as far. The Yankees added three more runs in the
fourth inning, making their lead 5-0; the Champagne drinkers among
them probably started imagining the bubbly.
</P>
<P>
   But Hernandez started picking at the corners and walked a couple
of hitters, and suddenly Scott Hatteberg ripped a monstrous grand
slam, cutting the lead to 5-4. Trot Nixon and Donnie Sadler, both
rookies, singled, and after Darren Bragg whiffed, Hernandez walked
John Valentin on four pitches, loading the bases once more. Mo
Vaughn was due to bat.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez knew that Ramiro Mendoza was warming up, so when Jeter
and Scott Brosius went to the mound, Hernandez knew that Torre had
asked them to buy a little time for Mendoza to get ready. Hernandez
faced the Yankee dugout and raised his hands in silent
body-language plea: I'm OK, I'm OK.
</P>
<P>
   Torre emerged from the dugout, and Hernandez crossed his arms
and looked away, then circled to the front of the mound. Holding
the ball at full arm's length, he greeted Torre at the edge of the
grass. Neither man seemed particularly pleased.
</P>
<P>
   But Mendoza pitched out of the jam, Paul O'Neill blasted home
runs in the fifth and eighth innings and Posada found himself
waiting on the mound for Rivera, then running from Jeter's spray of
beer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to mess up their clubhouse,'' said David Wells.
</P>
<P>
   Torre said, ``It's really great that we've been able to sustain
our play.'' And his smile seemed to reflect off the shining spots
of Champagne on his jacket, or vice versa.

 Abbott wins first start in nearly five years  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In the first game after the All-Star break, Paul
Abbott won a game in relief that Roger Clemens lost.
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens won 18 games that season and has won 98 since. Abbott,
meanwhile, virtually disappeared from the major league radar
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott reappeared Wednesday afternoon at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariner right-hander, who began the season just hoping to
make it to Class AAA Tacoma, made his first big-league start in
nearly five years and bedeviled the Tampa Bay Devil Rays for 62/3
innings, earning the win in the Mariners' 5-2 victory before 22,256
fans.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Alex Rodriguez didn't hit the home run he needed to
become just the third major leaguer with 40 homers and 40 stolen
bases in one season, but he singled twice and stole his 41st base.
Outfielder Ryan Radmonovich, replacing the injured Jay Buhner in
right field, slugged his first big-league home run, David Segui and
Joe Oliver had two hits apiece, and relievers Jose Paniagua and
Mike Timlin stuffed the 'Rays on one hit over the final 31/3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Abbott put the game in personal perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best (win) I've had in professional baseball,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   His fourth major league victory came in his 15th big-league
start, one that came much sooner than he ever could have imagined.
Abbott underwent the so-called Tommy John surgery last September,
repairing the ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   The patient is doing fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in a dream right now, shocked to even be here,'' he said.
``The way the season started, to be pitching here and win, I'm
numb.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Mariners are all but eliminated from the
American League pennant race, September isn't meanless for Abbott,
who will be 31 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners will be looking for pitching help during the
offseason, and Abbott, who called Wednesday an audition, might fit
in next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what their plans are,'' he said, ``but I'll try
to use this as a stepping-stone.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Lou Piniella liked what he saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used his fastball on both sides of the plate and showed a
nice changeup,'' he said. ``He was impressive and will get three
more starts this season.''
</P>
<P>
   Abbott also has something else to tell his kids Lance, 11, and
Trent, 10, who are in Fullerton, Calif. Their mom, Yvette, flew to
Seattle and attended yesterday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only regret is (his sons) weren't here,'' Abbott said.
``When I talked to them the other day on the phone (after joining
the M's), they asked me if I talked to (Ken) Griffey,'' Abbott
said.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone was talking about Abbott Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has gone through a lot to get here, and it's good to see
him pitch the way he did and win the game,'' Segui said.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coach Stan Williams sensed that Abbott's first start
since going 1-0 with a 1.20 earned run average in three starts at
Tacoma would be a good one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Lou before the game this guy had the stuff to win,''
Williams said. ``I could tell that by watching him in the (pregame)
warmups.''
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly nervous at first, Abbott walked the first hitter he
faced. He then got help when third baseman Russ Davis made a diving
stop of a hard grounder hit by Bobby Smith, turning it into an out,
and proceeded to outduel 13-game Devil Rays winner Rolando Arrojo.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella went to his bullpen for Paniagua in the seventh inning
after Quenton McCracken doubled with two outs and scored on John
Flaherty's single, cutting the lead to 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Paniagua retired six of the seven batters he faced _ one of them
on a sliding catch in right-center field by Griffey _ and Timlin
worked a quick and easy ninth to secure his 14th save.

CHANGE LIFTS NASCAR TRUCK SERIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For two seasons, declining television ratings and slumping
attendance plagued the Nascar Craftsman Truck Series, which was
marked by predictable results and repeat winners.
</P>
<P>
   In one three-race stretch early this season, there was a total
of just four lead changes in three races.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were real concerned,'' said Stacy Compton, driver of the
No. 86 RC Cola Ford, who began to consider other racing options.
``The ratings looked bad, the crowds looked bad and the media
wasn't coming out anymore. We were looking at other avenues.''
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, Nascar made a change. Before then, each race
included what was called a ``competition yellow,'' a pause midway
through the race when the drivers climbed out of their trucks,
which were taken into the garages for more fuel and adjustments.
The drivers then climbed back into their Ford, Chevy or Dodge
pickups and resumed racing without losing position.
</P>
<P>
   The intermission took away from the competitiveness of the
races, and was widely disliked by drivers and race fans alike in
part because it eliminated a most crucial part of racing: pit-stop
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   After surveying teams and fans, Nascar decided to do away with
the intermission, adding live pit stops to the 4-year-old series to
make races closer by making fuel and tire strategy as crucial to
winning as the driver's skill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really two races in one,'' said Dennis Huth, Nascar's
vice president for administration. ``The halftime break was not
very popular, with drivers or fans. It was making it too easy for
the top teams to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Nascar introduced the live pit stops at Pikes Peak on July 25,
and in the five pit-stop races since (Flemington, N.J., and the
Louisville Motor Speedway do not have pit facilities), the
turnaround has been astonishing.
</P>
<P>
   In those five races _ Pikes Peak, Indianapolis Raceway Park, New
Hampshire, Nashville and Heartland Park Topeka _ there were five
different winners, including two first-time winners. There were 50
lead changes among 35 drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a terrific move,'' said Craig Armstrong, vice president
and general manager of Portland Speedway. ``It has made the series
much more competitive. It's good for everybody, sponsors, fans and
teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Television ratings, which had been down significantly this
season, have increased slightly, growing by as much as 29 percent
over last year's figures at Indianapolis on July 30. However,
ratings were down at two of the five races, Pikes Peak and New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance figures have also grown slightly since the
introduction of live pit stops.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like this series has grown more in the last five
weeks than it has the last two years,'' said Compton, who has won
under both formats this season. ``I like the pit stops. It puts
strategy into the mix.''
</P>
<P>
   To insure that the recent resurgence continues, Nascar will
devote more money to promoting the series next season. And instead
of running races on five different television networks (CBS, TNN,
TBS, ESPN and ESPN2), which causes confusion for fans looking for
Saturday afternoon's truck race, Nascar is planning to streamline
its broadcast schedule, which could mean just one cable carrier
would show next season's races.
</P>
<P>
   Before the elimination of the mid-race break, the series' last
two champions, Jack Sprague (1997) and Ron Hornaday (1996), had won
six of 13 races this season. Since the change, each has just one
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Thursday's race at Richmond International Raceway,
the Truck Series has seven consecutive different winners, a
three-way championship separated by fewer than 100 points and 13
different pole winners. And the races have been close; three of the
five pit-stop races have been decided by less than one second.
</P>
<P>
   Compton was so concerned about the lack of interest in the
series earlier this season that he and his sponsors went to Nascar
to ask if the series would continue. Compton, who will probably
join the former truck series racers Mike Skinner and Kenny Irwin on
a Winston Cup team, wanted a reason not to begin looking at his
other options this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nascar asked for six weeks,'' he said. ``Now our sponsors
can't wait to sign a deal for next year.''

POP REVIEW: DECIPHERING PEARL JAM'S MESSAGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though there were no light shows, fabulous clothes or extreme
behavior, Pearl Jam's concert Tuesday night at the Continental
Airlines Arena in East Rutherford, N.J., had meta-messages galore.
</P>
<P>
   The band is touring behind its fifth and latest album,
``Yield,'' whose title has widely been interpreted as an
uncomfortable capitulation to the irritations of major rock-band
life. For Pearl Jam that means dropping a boycott and participating
in Ticketmaster's stranglehold on the rock-concert business (the
Continental Airlines Arena, as well as New York's Madison Square
Garden, where the band plays Thursday night and Friday, sells
tickets through Ticketmaster), coughing up a video, talking to the
press.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, the thought of the ``Yield'' tour sits on the edge
of passive-aggressive arrogance. Pearl Jam's enemies are the
superstructures that bring the music to the fans, but the fans have
sometimes ended up on the losing end of the band's righteous
struggles.
</P>
<P>
   Putting the worst face on it, the band's new message could be
read as ``we'll deign to serve you.'' But that's a simplification.
Yielding is a powerful metaphor for hitting one's 30s, for
maturing, for making the contorted compromises of adulthood. Pearl
Jam has navigated the straits particularly well, and stands just
about alone now as the country's great meaningful, brooding rock
band, where there once were legions of them.
</P>
<P>
   That feeling of importance and grandeur, that arena-rock
feeling, was at the core of the band's performance Tuesday; it was
the basic disposition inside the thudding, swirling music and Eddie
Vedder's muezzinlike baritone voice. But the surface of the show _
the available space for rock star messages _ was wiped clean.
</P>
<P>
   All his body language communicated that Vedder was walking a
tightrope between showman and private man. The members of the band,
which now includes the drummer Matt Cameron, formerly of
Soundgarden, barely look like rock stars anymore; the guitarist
Stone Gossard's bleached hair was the only indication that these
weren't just men with ordinary jobs.
</P>
<P>
   And Vedder shied away from the messianic side of arena rock: he
wasn't there to preach messages or whip up the crowd's emotions.
``I'm through with screaming and echoes that nobody hears,'' he
sang in a new song, ``Faithful.'' When he put his head down and
danced in place close to his microphone, or concentrated grinningly
on Gossard's expansive, Hendrix-like solos, they seemed merely
interior reactions.
</P>
<P>
   The band played a handful of its hits with what seemed much more
than a sense of duty: ``Alive,'' ``Even Flow'' and ``Better Man.''
But the night's best moments were more experimental, and only for
the music's sake: instrumental side trips in the middle of songs
where the drive dropped low and the band free-associated with
grooves and lyrics and ringing, lingering guitar tones. As a
device, it recalls Sonic Youth, another seasoned rock band
steadying itself gracefully; tellingly, during one of these side
trips in ``Daughter,'' Vedder quoted a line from the Sonic Youth
song ``Androgynous Mind'' as well as making a passing reference to
Bruce Springsteen's ``Jersey Girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the songs just shuffled to a close, dissipating the
energy but retaining tension with a strange sense of calm.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end, Vedder engaged in the obligatory rock star
ritual: he walked around the back of the stage to acknowledge 360
degrees of fan worship. But rather than wave or gesture at them, he
just gazed, like someone who doesn't want to overexcite a nervous
animal.
</P>
<P>
   And as a parting shot, the band played its most oblique and
pretty song: ``Yellow Ledbetter,'' whose probably meaningless
lyrics have been constantly revised according to time and
temperament. Accompanying Gossard's delicate filigree, Vedder sang
at his strongest and most undecipherable; it was the most graceful
of exits, like a slow deflation of a balloon.

EDITORIAL: KUROSAWA'S GIFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Sept. 9:
</P>
<P>
   In his autobiography, film director Akira Kurosawa recalled the
battles with his producer over the making of ``Rashomon.'' From the
outset, the producer complained that audiences would never accept
its story about four accounts of a rape and murder, with no hint of
which one was correct. Many years later, however, when the film was
hailed as one of the greatest of all times, Kurosawa caught that
same producer taking full credit for its success. ``I had the
feeling I was back in `Rashomon' all over again,'' the director
declared.
</P>
<P>
   The body of work left by Kurosawa, who died Sept. 6, is as
powerful and influential as that of any other creator in film. He
took a cliched Japanese form of the samurai drama and mixed in
story lines from Noh theater, Shakespeare, Russian literature,
popular detective fiction like Ed McBain's and other sources, using
them to reflect on character and choice. His epics were populated
by vagabonds, heroes, liars, cheats and cowards fighting or railing
at fate. But all the movies are best remembered visually _ the
shadowy forests of ``Rashomon,'' the graphic battle scenes in
``Seven Samurai'' or the blasted heath and castle ramparts of
``Ran.''
</P>
<P>
   Not always popular or understood in his own country, Kurosawa
opened the way for Western audiences to consider the seriousness of
Japanese cinema. The irony was that many of his films, aimed as
homage to Western genres, were remade by Hollywood. Film students
will long talk about Kurosawa as a man who changed the nature of
movies. But audiences will always respond emotionally to stories
that, for all the strangeness of their setting, are as immediate as
any ever filmed.

RANGERS SHUT OUT ROYALS, 8-0
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The 1980 Baltimore Orioles demonstrated how
insignificant multiple 20-game winners within one rotation can be.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers and their potential 20-game winners _ right-handers
Aaron Sele and Rick Helling _ strive to avoid a similar fate.
</P>
<P>
   Sele's performance during last night's 8-0 victory against the
Kansas City Royals at The Ballpark in Arlington improved the
Rangers' plight. Sele (18-10) surrendered only five hits and one
walk during seven scoreless innings and the Rangers ensured that no
ground will be lost in the American League West to the first-place
Angels, who played the Minnesota Twins last night in Anaheim,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Sele joined Helling (18-7) as one of the league's five 18-game
winners, and each could become 20-game winners with a combined
seven starts remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers manager Johnny Oates downplayed the significance of such
an accomplishment despite the fact that the major leagues produced
only four 20-game winners _ Toronto's Roger Clemens, Minnesota's
Brad Radke, Seattle's Randy Johnson and Atlanta's Denny Neagle _ in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't do you any good,'' Oates said. ``Depth is so
important. What's two 20-game winners and three five-game
winners?''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers?
</P>
<P>
   The remaining members of the Rangers' rotation own a 24-34
record and 6.50 earned-run average this season. Furthermore, the
Rangers own a 36-49 record in those games.
</P>
<P>
   Sele's latest performance improved the Sele/Helling combination
to 36-17 with a 4.32 ERA, and the Rangers own a 42-18 record when
either of those two start.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see a different ballclub between the lines with those two
pitching,'' Rangers right fielder Juan Gonzalez said. ``Those are
two guys that are going to throw seven, eight or nine innings. I
feel really comfortable when I see Helling and Sele out there on
the mound.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1980 Orioles likely experienced a similar disposition when
either Steve Stone (25-7) or Scott McGregor (20-8) took the mound.
Nevertheless, the New York Yankees won the AL East by three games
despite the Orioles' 100 victories and two 20-game winners.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers entered last night's contest staring at a two-game
deficit in the division, but Sele provided the rotation's ninth
quality start during the past 11 appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep saying that if we get pitching _ and it doesn't have to
be a shutout _ that we're going to make it tough on a lot of
people,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Sele, who allowed only two runners beyond first base, earned his
fifth consecutive victory in as many starts and improved his ERA to
1.73 during that span.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two guys have been very important to us this season,''
said designated hitter Lee Stevens, whose three-run, third-inning
home run off right-hander Pat Rapp (11-12) gave the Rangers a
seven-run advantage. ``They've picked us up so many times. There's
no special feeling among us when they take the mound. They're the
ones who make it special.''
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Will Clark and center fielder Tom Goodwin
supported Sele's bid with two-run doubles during the first and
second innings, and the right-hander did the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a pretty good team,'' Royals manager Tony Muser said,
``with Helling and Sele.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Rangers be without them?

BAD AS THEY LOOK, RANGERS ARE IN A RACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Like in so many other Septembers, the
baseball blahs seem just one game away, or one more pitching
collapse away, from descending again upon the Mid-Cities. For North
Texas, the annual passage into autumn normally begins with a
Rangers' season staggering to an unnoticed finish.
</P>
<P>
   This one has been headed in that direction for a while _ like
since June, really. And when the late-July trading deadline deals
failed to be a cure, there has been little to like about these
Rangers. And almost no reason for hope.
</P>
<P>
   As a team, it has greatly underachieved. It seemingly feeds off
no inspiration, nor is it a club that inspires faith. Emotion is at
a minimum. It is a team void of clubhouse leaders like Mickey
Tettleton and Darryl Hamilton. Also, no scoreboard lead is ever
safe, one reason being a collection of gruesome gloves. And outside
of Rick Helling, Aaron Sele or John Wetteland, the rest of the
pitching staff should be investigated by Kenneth Starr. Aren't
these people interns? They pitch like it. And please, no more John
Burkett.
</P>
<P>
   All of the above is the truth, nothing but the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, so is this:
</P>
<P>
   Based strictly on the bottom line, the Rangers of '98 currently
rank as one of the elite clubs in franchise history. Plus ...
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing as rare in Arlington as a real live September
divisional race, and the Rangers are actually in a good one. But
maybe because of how the
</P>
<P>
   season has gone, or because of repeated blown leads over the
last few weeks, a showdown-September with Anaheim is not exactly
the most torrid of sports topics on local street corners and bar
stools. But it is happening, and right before our tired eyes.
</P>
<P>
   When the Rangers beat Kansas City, 8-0, here last night, they
moved within 11/2 games of the American League West lead, pending
the Angels' outcome on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance was a perky 28,441, which means enough fans still
care. And for Anaheim's two-game visit next week, advance sales for
both are already over 31,000.
</P>
<P>
   An assortment of fans keep coming because the Rangers keep
scoring runs, allowing the AL West race to stay afloat. And last
night, Sele continued his bounce-back from a midseason slump,
throwing blanks for seven innings. This time, the bullpen didn't
vapor-lock.
</P>
<P>
   With the win, the Rangers moved to 11 games over .500, the
third-best record this late in the season in club history. Also,
the only time in 27 years they've been closer to first place in
September was 1996, and the Rangers held first in that eventual
division-winning season.
</P>
<P>
   But despite it all, these Rangers are dogged far more for their
repeated ineptness than praised for being in a divisional race.
Speaking of that race, if the Rangers weren't the home team, then
the local fan favorite, not to mention the media favorite, would be
the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Adversity in the form of injuries has continually ripped apart
Anaheim this season. And the injuries still pile up. But the Angels
have thus far overcome with grit, attitude and strong clubhouse
leadership. Night after night, they play old-school, hustling
hardball. Anaheim also backs down from no monster _ they won the
season series from the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, of course, have also had to dodge plenty of
adversity this season, but their adversity is self-inflicted.
</P>
<P>
   The five remaining games with Anaheim will probably decide the
AL West champ. But the team most deserving to win the title is _
easily _ Anaheim. Luckily for the Rangers, most deserving doesn't
count.
</P>
<P>
   Asked before last night's game if he was ``disappointed'' in his
team's overall performance, Oates at first answered, ``no.'' But
...
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me answer that again,'' Oates said on the rebound. ``I
always expect to be better. I just don't know at what level we'd
have to be at right now for me to say I wasn't disappointed. The
Yankees' record? Yeah, OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Mention pitching and defense, and Oates was quick to reply, ``I
don't think anyone in a uniform is pleased with those. When you are
ranked last or next to last in pitching and defense (the Rangers
are in the league's bottom four in both), then the numbers don't
lie.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have managed to reach our current level because we score
runs. We also give up about as many runs as we score. When you do
that, I'd say we are fortunate to be (11) games over .500.''
</P>
<P>
   And fortunate that this season still matters.

HOMER CHASE IN ARLINGTON? COULDA BEEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Mark McGwire thrilled the city of St. Louis with his
history-making 62nd home run Tuesday night. How would you like to
have been a part of that scene at The Ballpark in Arlington
instead?
</P>
<P>
   It could have happened and maybe more easily than you think.
</P>
<P>
   Do you realize, Rangers fans, how close you came to having both
McGwire ``and'' Sammy Sosa, who also seems likely to surpass 60
home runs before the season is over, on the same team in Texas?
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe ``close'' is a bit of a stretch. But within the realm
of possibility?
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has 62 homers and the Cubs' Sosa has 58 in the greatest
home-run duel in major-league history. How would the two of them
have looked wearing Rangers uniforms and sandwiched into the same
lineup as Juan Gonzalez, Will Clark and Pudge Rodriguez?
</P>
<P>
   Here's how, with just a bit of a stretch of the imagination,
that it all could have come together.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's the easy one, of course, because he was signed by Texas
and actually wore a Rangers uniform, however briefly, in 1989. We
all know the details of the much discussed _ and cussed _ midseason
trade that made Sosa part of the package, along with pitcher Wilson
Alvarez, that went to the White Sox for designated hitter Harold
Baines.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers general manager Tom Grieve, now the team's television
color analyst, was looking for another bat to help the Rangers get
over the hump in the pennant race. Texas, it turns out, is the only
place where Baines didn't hit. The trade has gone down as the
biggest bust in Rangers history.
</P>
<P>
   But did you know that a day or so after the trade, the White Sox
expressed concern that Sosa might have arrived from Texas as
damaged goods?
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to the ballpark one day and one of the trainers said a
player needed to see me,'' former Rangers team physician B.J.
Mycoskie, now retired, recalled the other day. ``I walked into the
room we used then and standing there in street clothes was Sammy
Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``His ankle was bothering him. I examined him and didn't find
anything to be overly concerned about.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, July 29, 1989, the trade sending Sosa and
Alvarez to the White Sox was announced.
</P>
<P>
   A day or so later, Mycoskie got a call from the White Sox team
doctor, asking for his opinion on Sosa's ankle. Mycoskie gave him
the report of his examination.
</P>
<P>
   Then Grieve called. The White Sox, he said, were claiming that
Mycoskie had told them that Sosa was in perfect health when that
wasn't the case. Were they hinting that they wanted out of the
deal?
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom said he was going to tell them if they didn't want Sosa to
send him back,'' Mycoskie said.
</P>
<P>
   While he doesn't recall the situation, Grieve said that's
exactly what he would have said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have told them if they thought they were getting
spoiled goods, to put him on a plane back to Texas,'' Grieve said.
``I would have called their bluff. I'm sure Dr. Myke's recollection
is good. He would have remembered.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the White Sox decided to let the trade stand.
</P>
<P>
   Getting McGwire to Texas requires a little more creativity, but
there could easily have been a logical progression of events that
would have made it happen. Remember when Rangers president Tom
Schieffer went looking for a new general manager to replace Grieve
in 1994? There were two men on his short list.
</P>
<P>
   One was Doug Melvin, the Baltimore assistant GM.
</P>
<P>
   The second was another up-and-coming baseball executive named
Walt Jocketty, assistant to Oakland's Sandy Alderson.
</P>
<P>
   By a whisker, Schieffer chose Melvin. The Cardinals snatched up
Jocketty, who brought manager Tony La Russa with him.
</P>
<P>
   La Russa being there was the reason McGwire, who was heading
toward free agency, agreed to a trade to the Cardinals on July 31,
1997, even though he was reluctant to move to the National League.
</P>
<P>
   Had Jocketty been hired by the Rangers, it is almost certain
that La Russa, not Johnny Oates, would have replaced Kevin Kennedy
as manager and that McGwire might have become a Ranger instead of a
Cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there are a lot of unanswered questions involved in the
scenario.
</P>
<P>
   Would Rangers ownership have paid enough to keep all those
stars?
</P>
<P>
   Highly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Would McGwire and Sosa have hit as many home runs playing at The
Ballpark in Arlington, with its deep left-center power alley?
</P>
<P>
   Doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   Or might Schieffer, seeing the possibilities with all that
right-handed power, have moved Home Run Porch to left field instead
of right?
</P>
<P>
   Not a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we wanted to be careful of was making it a home-run
happy park,'' Schieffer said. ``Since more hitters in baseball are
right-handers, you make right field the more homer-friendly part of
the park.''
</P>
<P>
   That didn't keep Schieffer from fantasizing the same emotional
celebration happening at The Ballpark in Arlington as he watched
events unfold Tuesday night in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It very well could still happen here,'' he said. ``Juan
Gonzalez is one of a handful of players who could conceivably
challenge whatever record is set.''
</P>
<P>
   He might be dreaming, but then, with their incredible summers,
McGwire and Sosa have made that so very easy to do.

Tennis in need of a pick-me-up
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DALE ROBERTSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NEW YORK _ Baseball needed Mark McGwire to make itself completely
whole again.
</P>
<P>
   American tennis, however, did not need McGwire. His homer
heroics have been a disaster for the sport's U.S. showcase, its
lone reminder of what the game used to mean to this country. Even
with Pete Sampras chasing his own meaty piece of history, the U.S.
Open's status in baseball's renaissance summer is strictly second
tier, particularly with names such as Seles, Kournikova and Agassi
vanished from the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly two-thirds of the media representatives occupying the
press room in the Arthur Ashe Stadium are foreign. And with the
Yankees trying to set the single-season win record up in the Bronx
while the Mets pursue the National League's wild-card slot next
door _ never mind the opening of the NFL season _ New York's media
eyes are focused elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But a dim glimmer of hope for tennis flickers.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks, oddly enough, to baseball.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, look where the national pastime stood in 1994. Passed
its time, that's where. A near-suicidal strike canceled the World
Series, which neither two world wars nor an earthquake could do.
</P>
<P>
   Now, ball's back in fashion again, the fans' anger and ennui
having been fully dissipated by the most compelling season of the
decade. Four years ago, a lot of us weren't sure the game was
salvageable _ or, for that matter, worth saving. Hence, maybe,
maybe, tennis has a future, too.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, when I say that, I mean in the States. It never has
been more robust in Europe, or more poised to explode in South
America, spurred on by the ever-increasing dominance of players
from almost everywhere except North America.
</P>
<P>
   And that's where the baseball analogy obviously doesn't apply.
Baseball's damage was largely self-inflicted, whereas tennis' is
mostly a case of shifting demographics. The deadly one-two punch:
The best players aren't American, and most Americans have stopped
playing recreationally.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the lost-in-the-shuffle feel of the current Flushing
fortnight notwithstanding, the Open remains an aberration, a sunny
eye of profitability ($130 million in revenues) in the tempest
buffeting tennis from sea to shining sea.
</P>
<P>
   You suspect the lure is primarily social, though. The matches
are a backdrop, an excuse to gather and mingle with the ``right''
set, rather than to watch sets. The crowds don't represent the
spillover from the bleachers at Yankee or Shea Stadium. They aren't
a cross section of anything except white-collar types.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Agassi, for whatever reason, will inspire actual,
Connors-worthy passion in grass-roots fans, something poor Sampras
can't do no matter how frequently he wins. Given the current
circumstances, the Open badly needed a crescendo conclusion, yet
today's desultory schedule, 11 days into the competition, has
hardly more U.S. appeal than a qualifying round.
</P>
<P>
   The men's final Sunday, intended to be the tournament's climax,
looms especially ugly, a so-what afterthought to the attractive
Sampras-Rafter semi on Saturday. Surely Pete, if he gets past the
defending champion, will handily beat any of the survivors from the
bottom half of the draw to secure his record-tying 12th Grand Slam
title. If he doesn't? That will really kill the party. Because we
do love to watch records being pursued, don't we?
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the USA Network distributed a news release
bragging about a dramatic rise in its Open ratings _ 40 percent
daytime and 11 percent overall. While that appears to fly in the
face of the perception that tennis' appeal is free-falling, the
fact is the actual numbers are minuscule.
</P>
<P>
   The 40 percent was from 0.5 to 0.7 and the 11 percent from .9 to
1.0. Whoopee.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the friendly confines of Queens, where the expensively
refurbished National Tennis Center sits in new-found _ albeit
antiseptic _ splendor, the picture is markedly grimmer. Among
American events, the Open dwarfs most of the tournaments that have
managed to survive, although the Newsweek Champions Cup at Indian
Wells, Calif., the Lipton Championships at Key Biscayne and the ATP
Championships at Cincinnati are solid.
</P>
<P>
   Many events have to buy TV time and fight desperately to secure
title sponsors. Former major tennis markets such as Houston, Dallas
and Chicago no longer have ATP or WTA Tour stops, and the men's
event in Philadelphia, long a bellwether, is the latest to confront
dire straits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Networks haven't figured out a way to make a profit on
tennis,'' CBS Sports president Sean McManus told the Wall Street
Journal recently. ``There simply hasn't been a strong enough
advertiser base.''
</P>
<P>
   It's unlikely tennis can turn itself completely around, short of
Agassi soaring miraculously back to No. 1 and/or Anna Kournikova
removing even more of her clothing. But if baseball can rally as it
has, anything is possible.

Astros, Lima subdue Brewers
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
On Tuesday night, Jose Lima called his father, Francisco Rodriguez,
in the Dominican Republic and guaranteed win No. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Before he left to go to the Astrodome on Wednesday, he told his
2-month-old son, Jose Jr., he would bring the game ball home.
</P>
<P>
   He delivered on both promises.
</P>
<P>
   Lima allowed two runs over eight innings Wednesday, and Craig
Biggio tied a career high with four hits as the Astros rolled to
their fifth straight victory, 6-2 over the Milwaukee Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember in spring training saying if they gave me the ball
I was going to have a great year,'' said Lima, a converted reliever
who had won a total of nine games in the previous four years
combined. ``I remember people laughed behind my back. It feels bad,
because I'm still young and have the talent. I just needed the
opportunity this year. I got the opportunity. It's not over yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Atlanta's 3-2 loss to Montreal, the Astros moved a
game ahead of the Braves in the race for the best record in the
National League. At 93-53, the Astros are three victories shy of
matching the franchise-record 96 set in 1986. Their magic number
for clinching a second consecutive NL Central title is five.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've worked pretty hard to get it,'' manager Larry
Dierker said of the Astros' one-game lead over the Braves for
home-field advantage in the playoffs. ``We've had to come from
behind on the (Padres and Braves) and still have a little ways to
go to try and protect it. The way we've been playing, I wouldn't be
surprised if we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Biggio went 4-for-5 and added the finishing touches on the
Astros' 17th victory in 21 games with an eighth-inning solo home
run. It was the second time this season Biggio has had four hits in
a game. He needs just three hits to break the club single-season
record of 195 set by Enos Cabell in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bagwell homered for the second straight game and finished
2-for-4.
</P>
<P>
   That was more than enough support for Lima, who either as a
reliever or starter has owned the Brewers throughout his career. He
is 6-0 lifetime against them, with three victories this season.
After allowing a first-inning solo home run to Dave Nilsson, Lima
did not allow another run until Marquis Grissom's solo homer in the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Wagner, who relieved Lima with two runners on base in the
ninth, got out of a bases-loaded jam with two strikeouts and
recorded his 28th save when Darrin Jackson flied out to center
field to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   Since July 27, Lima is 7-1 with a 2.86 ERA. Only once has he
failed to pitch at least seven innings. For the third time this
season, he dominated the Brewers, scattering seven hits and two
runs in eight-plus innings. He struck out seven, walked none and
retired 12 straight batters at one point.
</P>
<P>
   In three starts against Milwaukee, Lima has allowed only five
runs in 23 innings. The Astros are 20-10 in games the righthander
starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never dreamed he would be this consistent,'' Dierker said of
Lima. ``I was just hoping he would be able to give us six or seven
innings most of the time. That's about the extent of my
expectations, even hopes, in the early part of the season. He has
really matured into a fine pitcher. I think tonight's game, outside
the ninth inning, was the best game he pitched all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee scored early off Lima when Nilsson hit a two-out,
bases-empty home run to left-center field in the first inning, his
sixth homer in his last eight games and the 28th allowed by Lima
this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers' lead didn't last long.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros countered with four runs in the bottom half of the
first as Bagwell, Moises Alou, Sean Berry and Ricky Gutierrez drove
in runs off Brewers righthander Steve Woodard (9-11), who lost to
the Astros for the third time this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offense was working well,'' Biggio said. ``We did some
little things right. We got some runs early, and whenever you can
get four runs after they got one in the top half of the first, it's
a big boost for the starting pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Biggio, who has 193 hits and a career-high 82 RBIs, led off the
inning with a single and advanced to second on a single by Carl
Everett. Following a fielder's choice by Derek Bell, Bagwell tied
the game with a double to left field. Alou's RBI single put the
Astros ahead to stay, and Berry delivered a run-scoring double.
Gutierrez completed the scoring in the inning with a grounder to
third.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when I give up three runs in the first inning, I say
in my mind there's no way I'm going to lose this game for three
runs,'' Lima said. ``All I have to do is concentrate and keep the
team in the game to the seventh inning without giving up any more
runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell added a solo home run to left off Woodard in the third
inning, his 31st of the season. Bagwell, who had three hits and six
RBIs, including his first career grand slam on Tuesday against
Cincinnati, is batting .404 during the last 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros have won eight of 10 meetings with the Brewers this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are hitting on all cylinders,'' Milwaukee manager
Phil Garner said. ``They've just pounded us.''

LA NINA MAY DELIVER MILD FALL, WINTER
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attention Florida and Texas editors.) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY DAVID R. BAKER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After a year of bizarre and destructive weather
brought by El Nino, Los Angeles might face a mild fall and winter
courtesy of the weather phenomenon's drier twin _ La Nina,
forecasters are saying.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a Wednesday meeting of disaster planning experts in
the L.A. area suburb of Burbank, scientists said La Nina _ in many
ways the opposite of El Nino _ should bring Southern California
typical winter temperatures and a little less rain than normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to get a breather this winter,'' said Ants
Leetmaa, director of the National Weather Service's Climate
Prediction Center. ``People worried that their houses were going to
slide down the hill can breathe a little easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Other parts of the country, however, might not fare so well. La
Nina could bring Florida a dry spring, potentially kindling a new
rash of forest fires like those that plagued the state earlier this
summer. And Texas, where a devastating drought was recently broken
by heavy rain, could turn dry again.
</P>
<P>
   ``People there need to be putting this in the back of their
minds, saying, Hey, we haven't had rain in a while, this could
last,'' said Leetmaa.
</P>
<P>
   Since May, forecasters have watched the current La Nina
condition building in the Pacific Ocean, while the remains of El
Nino slowly fade.
</P>
<P>
   The two form opposite ends of a climate cycle, a constant play
between ocean temperatures and the atmosphere. El Nino is fueled by
unusually warm water in the eastern equatorial Pacific _ La Nina,
by cold.
</P>
<P>
   Both phenomena have the power to change weather across the
globe, flooding some regions while choking others with drought. In
Southern California, El Nino usually brings more rain than normal
while La Nina brings less.
</P>
<P>
   If projections hold, the current La Nina will lack the strength
of the El Nino that is just ending, the most powerful on record. In
some parts of the country, said Leetmaa, the effects of this
moderate La Nina will be difficult to spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``This La Nina is more of a middle-of-the-road kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In others areas, however, the changes could be pronounced,
especially when compared to last year. After enjoying a balmy
winter brought on by El Nino, the upper Midwest likely will see
cold temperatures and above-average precipitation during the first
months of 1999. The Southwest, meanwhile, will be hotter and drier
than it was last winter.
</P>
<P>
   While Southern California probably will see less rain than
normal, central and northern parts of the state could have
increased rainfall between October and December, then dry out in
January, according to the National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   The weather service's predictions come even as El Nino continues
its slow dissipation in the Pacific, parts of which are still
warmer than normal.
</P>
<P>
   Betsy Morse, meteorologist in charge of the service's Sacramento
office, said El Nino's remnants may have helped bring last week's
unusual rain to Los Angeles by allowing tropical moisture connected
with a Pacific hurricane to stray farther north than normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have El Nino and La Nina _ it's an unusual time,'' she
said. &QL;

WORLDLY MANNER WINS FUTURITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEL MAR _ The Bob Baffert party rolled on Wednesday, when the
trainer of the past two Kentucky Derby winners showed he's got a
leading, early contender for the next Derby.
</P>
<P>
   The horse is Worldly Manner, a stout 2-year-old who, with only a
little encouragement from jockey Kent Desormeaux, ran away with the
$250,000 Del Mar Futurity on a cloudy closing day at the seaside
racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   After which, Baffert put on his patented winner's-circle act,
posing with the trophy on his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Worldly Manner) is in the right stable,'' said Desormeaux,
referring to Baffert's Derby victories with Silver Charm (1996),
himself a Futurity winner, and Real Quiet (1997). ``He's got a lot
to look forward to, this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Worldly Manner ($2.80), a brown son of Riverman, won by five
lengths over Golden Eagle Farm entrymate Daring General and is 3
for 4 in his young career. His only defeat was a third-place finish
in the Hollywood Juvenile Championship won by Yes It's True.
</P>
<P>
   D. Wayne Lukas-trained Yes It's True has since gone east,
leaving Worldly Manner as the western leader going into the Oct. 11
Norfolk Stakes at Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   The May 1, 1999 Derby is a long way off, and 1\ miles is a lot
longer than the 7 furlongs Worldly Manner ran (in 1:23) Wednesday.
But he looks as if he'll keep going.
</P>
<P>
   Which means Baffert, who has dominated the 2- and 3-year-old
scene since 1996, will keep going.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert clinched his second straight Del Mar training title with
two winners to finish with 18, four more than Barry Abrams and Bob
Hess Jr. Corey Nakatani capped his riding title with his 44th
winner, giving him 11 more than Alex Solis.
</P>
<P>
   Homecoming: The Los Angeles County Fair season at Fairplex Park
in Pomona opens with a 12-race card _ the first for appaloosas and
the rest of thoroughbreds _ today at 12:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-straight-day season takes the Southern California racing
circuit up to the Oak Tree meet at Santa Anita that begins Sept.
30.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Ladies Din, winner of the Del Mar Derby and two other
stakes, was named Horse of the Meet in a close press-box vote over
Free House, winner of the Pacific Classic.... After an epidemic of
fatal breakdowns in the first week, the Del Mar meet finished with
a total of 13 horse deaths, 11 from injuries and two from organ
failure. That's below the average, 15, for the past 10 Del Mar
seasons, according to statistics kept by UC Davis.... Two turf
horses earned their second stakes victories of the meet Wednesday:
Joe Who (in the Live the Dream Handicap) and Tuzla (in the
Palomar).... The Del Mar Futurity horses were held in the paddock
for 10 minutes while the track rail, damaged by an errant tractor,
was being repaired.

YANKEES CLINCH AT RED SOX' EXPENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Wednesday night's celebration, at least on the field,
was a muted one, a pinstriped scrum between the mound and second
base.
</P>
<P>
   When you've won 100 games faster than any American League team
in history, like these New York Yankees have, winning the AL East
title is mere appetizer to what they assume is their manifest
destiny _ claiming their 24th World Series championship.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the Yankees had filed off the field without so much
as exchanging a back slap after their 7-5 win over the Red Sox
Wednesday night at Fenway Park, it still would have served as a
galling reminder for Boston fans, who for 20 years have been spared
the sight of a Yankee team winning any kind of title on Yawkey Way.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the last one are mentioned here only for the benefit
of those fans still in denial two decades later: one-game playoff,
Mike Torrez and Bucky Dent, Yaz popping out to Graig Nettles for
the final out.
</P>
<P>
   Don Zimmer, 50 years in baseball, was here then as manager of
the losing side, and he was here Wednesday night as aide de camp to
manager Joe Torre when the Yankees won the rubber game of this
three-game set behind two home runs apiece by Derek Jeter and Paul
O'Neill and a bullpen that allowed just one hit over the last four
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Wednesday night, there were no champagne fountains
springing up around Zim in '78.
</P>
<P>
   ``The toughest thing about it was winning 99 games, then walking
into the clubhouse to see grown men cry,'' Zimmer said. ``Breaks
your heart, but that's part of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The heartbreak part, of course, the Red Sox have down cold. But
while the Yankees were rolling in the bubbly again Wednesday night,
the Sox still clung to the quite plausible notion that their party
time is still to come, even if they've lost six of their last seven
and eight of their last 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a great ball club, there's no question about it,'' Mo
Vaughn said of the Yankees, who are 102-41 and need to go just 10-9
the rest of the way to break the AL record of 111 wins in a season,
set by the Cleveland Indians in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ran away from the East a long time ago,'' said Vaughn,
who probably doesn't remember that back on May 25, after the
Yankees clocked the Sox here, 14-4, the New York Post proclaimed
that the Bombers' magic number was 112. ``They just officially put
it in the book tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're not battling them. We're battling ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians helped the Sox more than they helped themselves
Wednesday night as Travis Fryman's three-run homer in the 13th beat
Boston's closest pursuers, the Toronto Blue Jays. With 18 games
left, the Sox maintained their 4 1/2-game lead in the wild-card
race, though after Texas beat Kansas City, the Rangers are now even
with the Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Panic is what everybody writes and talks about, but in here,
we keep it tight,'' Vaughn said. ``We'll keep pushing. They can
write and talk about it all they want, but this team will be fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've responded well and we will continue to. We have a little
challenge now.''
</P>
<P>
   Down, 5-0, Wednesday night in the fourth inning after Jeter took
Tim Wakefield deep twice and Tino Martinez and Jorge Posada added
run-scoring doubles and Scott Brosius an RBI single, the Sox pulled
within a run on two occasions. Scott Hatteberg's first career grand
slam, off Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez, made it 5-4 in the
fourth. And after O'Neill answered off reliever John Wasdin with
the first of his two home runs in the fifth, the Sox scored in the
bottom of the inning when Nomar Garciaparra doubled, Troy O'Leary
singled, and Mike Stanley hit into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Neill hit another bases-empty home run, this one off lefty
Greg Swindell in the eighth, after Yankees second baseman Chuck
Knoblauch converted Vaughn's one-hop rocket into a double play in
the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``That play by Knoblauch probably hurt us more than anything,''
Sox manager Jimy Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't helped, either, that in the last week, the Red Sox
have faced pitchers who have either won Cy Young Awards or are in
contention this season: Roger Clemens, Pat Hentgen, David Wells,
and David Cone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know the answer,'' Hatteberg said, ``but it's not like
we're rolling over and not playing like we can.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tough stretch, but we're still in the lead.''
</P>
<P>
   That lead, nine games on Aug. 26, is half that on Sept. 10. As
Zimmer would be the first to agree, it's too early even to think
about champagne. The Yankees, and the Yankees only, have that
right.

IT'S SURPRISING PARTY IN YANKEES CLUBHOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ We have known since May that the Yankees would win the
American League East. They have led the division by 10 ... nah, 30
... well, more like 50 ... OK, maybe 70 games all season. At least
it seemed so.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night the New Yorkers made it official at Fenway Park.
They beat the Red Sox, 7-5, for their 102d win of the season. It
was the first time since, yes, 1978 that the Yankees won the
division in Boston. Twenty years ago, their triumph in a one-game
playoff against the Sox was their 100th win. Now they have two more
than that with more than two weeks left in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would go down to the wire,'' David Wells said,
beer in his hand and all over his jersey. ``Glad I don't have to
clean up this place.''
</P>
<P>
   That's right, Boston. The Yankees came to town and trashed the
house.
</P>
<P>
   Their clubhouse turned into a frat party. Beer shooting from the
left. Champagne from the right. Not a dry eye or hair or uniform in
the building. The good thing is that the visiting clubhouse did not
smell of sweat. Replacing that odor was billowing cigar smoke. All
the Yankees were given stogies for the least surprising party in
baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yankees Clinch'' as a headline rivals ``Sun To Rise In East.''
Since everyone knows that, what was up with the House Party Gone
Wild vibe?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these guys have never been through this before,''
coach Don Zimmer said. ``They deserve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer is a smart man. Maybe that's why he made his initial
comments tucked safely in a corner. He knows how baseball teams
react when they can disrupt the grind of a long season with
something unusual. Twenty years ago, Zimmer was in the Sox
clubhouse, trying to explain how his team lost a 14-game August
lead and the division. He said the hardest thing was watching grown
men cry then. Wednesday night it looked like everyone was crying.
But that was beer streaming down their cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams sat near his locker, dry, talking about the
strength of the Yankees. ``We don't have anyone with 40 or 50 home
runs,'' he said. ``We don't have anyone with 150 RBIs ...''
</P>
<P>
   He was going to start talking about how grateful the Yankees are
to be in this position. But suddenly, there was a man on his left,
a man on his right, and a man behind him. They emptied a few
bottles on his head. He shrieked, jumped out of his folding chair,
then walked back toward his temporary locker. ``They set me up,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Across the room, Mariano Rivera had been drenched with a shower
earlier. The Yankees didn't want any dry bodies among them. They
feel they deserve a chance to enjoy themselves, even if people in
Boston began talking about the wild card months ago. Remember, the
Yankees say, they lost four of their first five games and New
Yorkers were talking about firings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was in the papers that Joe (Torre) might lose his job,''
Wells said. ``We just told ourselves that we're better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Torre is in position to manage a team that could win the
most games in AL history. The 1954 Cleveland Indians had 111 wins.
The 1906 Chicago Cubs hold the major league record with 116. But
the Yankees aren't thinking about that. If you asked them about
history Wednesday night, they would have offered you a beer or a
cigar. And if you asked where to put the empty bottles, they would
have told you to leave them on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to mess up this clubhouse,'' Wells said of the rival
Sox.
</P>
<P>
   He sipped some more. So did the rest of the team. They hung
around for a while, took showers, and went for the only dry items
in the area: their clothes. You have to understand that they are
smart champs. Their clothes were safely in their stalls, shielded
by huge plastic coverings.

SAMPRAS, RAFTER SET UP DUEL 
</HEADLINE>
 OPEN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Karol Kucera messed up one high-profile duel. Pete
Sampras wasn't about to let him meddle with another.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, a four-time US Open winner, knocked Kucera out of the
tournament, 6-3, 7-5, 6-4, Wednesday night, setting up a Saturday
semifinal date with defending champion Patrick Rafter, who routed
Jonas Bjorkman, his doubles partner, 6-2, 6-3, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   Kucera had beaten Andre Agassi, costing him a shot at Sampras.
Now he hoped to come between Rafter and Sampras. Between the guy
who won last year's championship and the guy who won the two before
that. Between two guys who love to follow their serves to the net
and have created an instant rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no stopping Sampras on a chilly and windy evening,
just as there was no stopping Rafter during the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   In women's quarterfinals, No. 5 seed Venus Williams roared back
to beat 1994 Open champion Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, 2-6, 6-1, 6-1,
and gain a semifinal berth opposite No. 2 seed Lindsay Davenport,
who knocked out No. 13 Amanda Coetzer, 6-0, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport beat Williams in three sets in the quarterfinals at
the Australian Open, and they have split two matches since then.
</P>
<P>
   Williams made bundles of unforced errors in the first set and
eliminated them in the next two _ she had 18 in the first set, 17
in the final two combined _ in an impressive display. French Open
champion Sanchez Vicario held serve only once in each of the last
two sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go out there, you know you're going to have to hit a
lot of balls, a plethora of balls,'' Williams said. ``You really
have to make sure that you're patient and ready to go and just
ready to stay out there no matter what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   And after the first set, that's what she did.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras and Rafter had few problems in their matches.
</P>
<P>
   Kucera made his best bid in the second set. He was up, 3-0, but
Sampras broke to get it back on serve. They stayed on serve until
the 11th game and seemed headed for a tie-breaker.
</P>
<P>
   Then Sampras struck again.
</P>
<P>
   He reached for a nice forehand volley to break, then served out
the set.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras had lost to Kucera in the quarterfinals of the
Australian Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``He picked me apart down in Australia,'' Sampras said. ``I was
probably more on my toes tonight. I was ready to play tonight. He's
tough. He's a great mover and he returns very well. I just kind of
won the match. I didn't play bad. I didn't play great. I kind of
got through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he takes aim at Rafter, against whom Bjorkman, one of the
best at return of service in the game, played pretty well. But he
could do little with the defending champ.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I had to change too much because of the
conditions,'' Bjorkman said. ``I had to change because Pat was
playing too good in the beginning. You know, I was trying to come
in a lot. But he surprisingly was returning, and his passing shots
were working better than I have ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafter agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't play much better than that, I don't think,'' he said.
``Just volleyed very well, served very well _ I could go on. Yeah,
it was a great day for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Only in one game in the first two sets did Bjorkman come close
to breaking Rafter's serve. And in that one, Rafter quickly dug out
of the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter broke Bjorkman in the seventh game of the third set and
served for 5-3. Finally, Bjorkman broke. But three games later,
Rafter broke again and led, 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   Bjorkman had a couple of game points, first at 40-30 and again
after holding off a Rafter break point, but could not hold off the
Australian.
</P>
<P>
   That hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know,'' Bjorkman said. ``You have to fight all the
way in. Sometimes you get the third set. You never know _ you could
turn around everything.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rafter broke Bjorkman for the final time, then served out
the match.

 &HT;    Don't blame the Internet for the failings of humanity
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The big news in technology this past week came from Carnegie
Mellon University in Pittsburgh, where researchers discovered that
people who spent hours and hours on the Internet each night didn't
have time left to have any real human relationships.
</P>
<P>
   And because of that, these cyber-junkies spent a lot of time
being depressed.
</P>
<P>
   What a surprise that was. It is roughly equivalent to
discovering that people who walk in the rain get wet and then long
to be dry.
</P>
<P>
   Here we have the research subjects, a hundred or so people in
Pittsburgh who _ instead of taking walks and hugging _ sit in front
of a computer monitor all night. And lo and behold, they have lousy
personal lives, lose touch with their families and feel terrible.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes researchers at fancy universities are so danged smart
they overlook the obvious.
</P>
<P>
   I think those Ph.D.s confused a symptom for the disease. Imagine
what they would have found if they surveyed people who spent almost
all their spare time playing golf, or dancing or watching TV. Do
you think their personal relationships would be any better? Would
the day magically have more hours in it?
</P>
<P>
   I'm the last person in the world to defend the sort of shallow
relationships spawned in the Internet's chat groups. I'd much
rather talk to someone I can see. And my guess is that most of the
friendships and the romances that develop there have the life span
of a fly. But I also think it is likely the same people would find
shallow and short-lived relationships in the real world. I'm saying
that it's not the Internet's doing; it's the people.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, some of these people with friendships and romances that
exist only in cyberspace are doing the best they can. People who
are shy or socially inept in real life sometimes become bold and
witty in the pretend world of the chat groups. My guess is that
many of them wouldn't have any relationships at all if not for the
Internet. I'm thinking that any human contact _ no matter how
flawed _ is better than none at all. So it's hard to judge.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing surprising about the fact new technology is seen
as magical, with exaggerated notions of how good it is or how evil
it is. That's a human reaction that dates all the way back to
primitive man. In the very earliest days, even fire was seen as a
spirit. When the first cameras came along, people were afraid the
images they took would capture our souls.
</P>
<P>
   In the Golden Age of Television, some social critics saw it as a
demonic force that would destroy civilization; others thought it
would automatically change tastes and make opera and theater lovers
out of the masses. Civilization may be a little battered, but it's
still around. And instead of being a nation of theater lovers, we
watch MTV.
</P>
<P>
   It's strange how little the human thinking process has changed.
We use different words and terms than medieval people, but we still
think new technology has magical powers. Instead of seeing the
Internet as the particularly complex and efficient delivery system
for data that it is _ a neutral pipeline that doesn't care what it
carries _ we believe the pipeline itself has a personality of its
own and powers far beyond what you'd expect from a bunch of wires
and fiber-optic cable.
</P>
<P>
   For what it's worth, I think people should worry more about
spending time with those they love than in trying to find witches
hiding in the Internet. It's a lot easier to blame technology than
ourselves for our failings. But when we do that, the problem
becomes unsolvable. We can't fix the technology; we can only fix
ourselves. Either that or move out of Pittsburgh.

 &HT;    Dunn dropped out of Bengal's offensive line
 &HT;    By Chick Ludwig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ David Dunn's effectiveness as a player couldn't
outweigh the headaches he caused management and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Tired of dealing with Dunn's annual weight problem, the Bengals
waived the fourth-year veteran and went looking for a wide receiver
to replace him.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn and linebacker James Francis reported overweight to
training camp in July after getting sent home from May minicamp for
the same indiscretion.
</P>
<P>
   But Francis needed just over a week to reach his playing weight
of 257 pounds, while Dunn struggled for a month to get down from
240 to 220, finally crashing through the ``thin ice'' head coach
Bruce Coslet said he was walking on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, he just wasn't with the program,'' said Coslet, who
dropped the bombshell in a news conference at Spinney Field. ``He
was overweight and ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to give him every benefit of the doubt over a long
course of time. I've been criticized for giving him too much slack.
I finally got fed up, hoping he would come around. He never did. I
was forced to take this action to protect the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn was shutout in the 24-13 loss to the Tennessee Oilers and
got flagged for a 10-yard offensive pass interference penalty that
nullified a 12-yard pass to Scott.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always resisted getting in shape and staying in shape,''
general manager Mike Brown said. ``I'm not going to have him make
his problems our problems any longer. We're going to go on and get
someone who's in shape who can run and perform as he should.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn, 26, the Bengals' fifth-round draft choice out of Fresno
State in 1995, was in his third season as the No. 3 receiver behind
Carl Pickens and Darnay Scott. He caught 76 passes for 1,132 yards
and four touchdowns in 46 games, five as a starter in 1997 after
Pickens went down with a torn groin.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 1 highlight of his career came on Nov. 10, 1996 when he
returned a kickoff 90 yards for a touchdown against Pittsburgh on
the final play of the first half that tied the score at 17 and
sparked the Bengals to a 34-24 victory.
</P>
<P>
   He ranks third in Bengals history in both total kickoff return
yardage (2,361) and total returns (104), trailing Stanford Jennings
(2,752 and 136) and Eric Ball (2,474 and 115) on both lists.
</P>
<P>
   Coslet said rookie Damon Gibson becomes the No. 3 receiver with
newly-acquired Stepfret Williams not far behind. James Hundon will
enter the picture as soon as his sprained left ankle heals.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, a third-year wideout claimed off waivers from the
Dallas Cowboys last week, has experience in the No. 3 role. He
could be activated for Sunday's game at Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``A third down receiver has to have a certain sense urgency when
he comes on the field,'' Coslet said. ``You get one shot or you
punt. That's pretty big.
</P>
<P>
   ``Step is a veteran. The terminology is different, but he knows
how to run patterns. We might have to spoon feed him if he would be
active and we'd put him in the game. But I think he would do
well.''

 &HT;    Central Texas sees increase in construction-site deaths
 &HT;    By Cara Tanamachi
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The ongoing drought and a booming Austin economy
have meant nonstop work for area construction contractors and
building firms.
</P>
<P>
   But the long hours and multiple jobs for construction workers
have had unexpected and negative side effects _ fatigue and
carelessness that have resulted in the accidental deaths of more
than two dozen Central Texas workers on building sites this year _
the most fatalities for the area in one eight-month period in a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, 25 Central Texas workers, including four in
Austin and five in Williamson County, have died on construction
jobs, up more than 50 percent from the same time last year,
according to statistics from the Austin branch of the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA. All on-the-job deaths
this year in a 17-county Central Texas area have been in
construction, according to OSHA officials.
</P>
<P>
   Those figures run contrary to statewide numbers for last year,
which showed a 10 percent drop in the total number of workers _
construction and nonconstruction _ killed on the job, compared with
1996.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 in Central Texas, the most common accident on a job site
was electrocution, followed by vehicle accidents _ workers being
hit by traffic near or on construction sites. Two workers so far
this year have died from heat stroke.
</P>
<P>
   John Giefer, OSHA's assistant area director, attributes the rise
in construction-site deaths partly to the drought, which has
enabled contractors to work longer hours with fewer days off.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lack of rain has really been a boon to construction
companies, but unfortunately, we're seeing more guys on the job
that are just fatigued, who aren't resting well enough, and who get
careless,'' he said. ``It's the only way to explain some of these
accidents.''
</P>
<P>
   OSHA issued citations to 13 of the 24 companies or contractors
who lost a worker, finding that they were negligent or in violation
of work safety standards. Seven contractors still are being
investigated.
</P>
<P>
   Fines for such offenses range from $1,000 to $7,000 per
violation.
</P>
<P>
   Del Tally, an independent job safety consultant who owns a
nonprofit safety firm, Construction and Safety Health Inc. in
Austin, said overall most Central Texas construction companies,
especially larger more established firms, have taken a greater
interest in safety training over the past several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since OSHA was formed in 1970, there's been a 50 percent
reduction in construction fatalities nationwide, so we have made
and continue to make tremendous strides in safety,'' he said. ``I
think the emphasis on safety is increasing in the construction
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Tally said the increase in the number of fatalities for 1998 may
only be an indication that the number of construction jobs have
increased _ not necessarily that construction sites are less safe.
</P>
<P>
   However, the booming building business has attracted a number of
new contractors who may or may not be aware of OSHA safety
standards, Giefer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Construction sites here are hit and miss,'' he said. ``We have
very good contractors, but we also have our share of new,
small-time contractors wanting to get a piece of the action who we
find aren't always as safety-conscious as they could be.''
</P>
<P>
   OSHA offers free safety counseling for employers, including
walk-in appointments the first Monday of every month at its Austin
office. Tally's safety organization also teaches classes for
employers, including on-site job safety training in English and
Spanish, starting at $35.

 &HT;    Cases may help public workers who sue bosses
 &HT;    By Osler McCarthy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Call one the case of the one-legged police
officer teamed with a partner fresh from heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Call the other the case of the struggling professor denied
tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Supreme Court justices recently heard arguments in both
cases that could lower the hurdle for public employees suing their
supervisors for retaliating against them.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision _ probably months away _ would grapple with
a legal standard devised by Austin's Texas Court of Appeals. That
lower-court decision gave public employees a better chance at
getting a trial when they claimed a supervisor intentionally harmed
them.
</P>
<P>
   Austin lawyer John Judge, who represents the employees in both
cases, said their position runs counter to a trend in federal
courts that Texas is urged to follow. ``Basically, it tells people
who have been victims of outrageous conduct, tough,'' Judge said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the perpetrators, it tells them, you have a free ride,''
he said. ``You're not accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Johnsen, the assistant attorney general representing
the state in one case, argued that the new standard set by the
appeals court would open a lawsuit to subjective considerations _
and expensive discovery. Until the court of appeals decision, cases
by public employees suing their supervisors were evaluated
according to whether the supervisors acted in good faith.
</P>
<P>
   If so, then they acted with immunity.
</P>
<P>
   In one case heard Wednesday, five Midland police officers
claimed that their payback for asking for disability considerations
was transfers and punitive assignments. Two of them _ one with
heart and lung disease, the other an amputee _ said they requested
airport duty but were assigned instead together on nighttime
patrol.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chief at the time decided we weren't going to have any
disabled officers,'' said former Detective Milton O'Bryant. ``Plain
and simple.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Bryant said he ``blew out'' his back on a strength test in
1989, then returned to detective work two years later handling
cases bound for court with a doctor's approval as fully fit. But he
said the doctor advised against violent or physical confrontations
_ and that led to his reassignment to answering telephones, a job
that became a civilian position and reduced his monthly pay by
about $400.
</P>
<P>
   In the other case, the University of Texas-Pan American in
Edinburg dismissed a business professor who it claimed had not met
his tenure requirements.
</P>
<P>
   He sued, claiming colleagues who reviewed him for tenure
retaliated against him because he reported two of them for illegal
conduct and voted against a raise for a third.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases the employees claimed their supervisors had acted
intentionally to inflict emotional distress.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the trial judges dismissed the lawsuits, deciding
that the supervisors were protected by an immunity because the
employees could not show from their court pleadings that the
supervisors acted in bad faith.
</P>
<P>
   The court of appeals said the dismissals were based on a test
that covered negligent conduct, not something intentional.
</P>
<P>
   In deciding whether to dismiss a lawsuit based on outrageous
conduct by a supervisor, such as retaliation, the appeals court
held, the trial judge needed to look into personal considerations.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we hope the Supreme Court will grasp as a distinguishing
feature,'' Judge said, ``is the difference between a
spur-of-the-moment high-speed chase . . . and when a guy at a desk
plots and schemes for months to ruin a person's life simply to vent
his personal agenda.''

 &HT;    Genetic database helps get suspects
 &HT;    By Rebeca Rodriguez
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ For the first time in Texas, law enforcement
officials have used a high-tech DNA database to positively link a
person to a crime where the only evidence available was DNA from
the crime scene, state officials announced.
</P>
<P>
   A Texas man has been charged with the sexual assaults of two
young North Texas girls in 1993, a case in which he had not been a
suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have a DNA database that proverbially allows us to find
the needle in the haystack,'' said Gov. George W. Bush at a press
conference announcing the event.
</P>
<P>
   The use of the database as an investigative tool could usher in
a whole new era of crime detection and prosecution, officials say.
But the use of DNA _ the distinct genetic blueprint found in human
cells _ as the sole piece of evidence to catch criminals is in its
infancy in Texas, and it may be awhile before it becomes
commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the Legislature passed a law requiring anyone convicted
of or serving time for a sex offense in Texas to submit a blood
sample. The blood samples are sent to the Texas Department of
Public Safety's laboratory in Austin, where DNA information is
analyzed and entered into a database.
</P>
<P>
   When a sex offense is committed, law officers collect evidence
from the crime scene and alert DPS laboratory officials, who
compare the existing DNA information from the blood samples with
crime scene evidence. A so-called cold hit occurs when the DNA of a
person who is not a suspect in a particular crime is matched with
DNA from the scene of that crime.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas database, which has 7,500 DNA profiles and 7,000 blood
samples waiting to be analyzed, is one cog in a national program
called CODIS, or Combined DNA Index System. As of August 1997,
35states had databases. All 50 states have legislation in place to
create them.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state money pays for the program, which costs
approximately $600,000 to $700,000, though that figure could rise
as the database grows.
</P>
<P>
   CODIS, administered through the FBI, can be accessed by law
enforcement officials to search for matches, even in cases where
there are no suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the case with the assaults of the two young girls in
Granbury, 35 miles southwest of Fort Worth. The sisters, ages 10
and 11, were each sexually assaulted in a dry creek bed near their
home while the other was forced to watch, according to Detective
Bruce Espin of the Granbury Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   The only evidence law enforcement officials had to go on was
some semen collected from the victims' clothing. At the time, it
was not enough to charge anyone with the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, Lester Don Parks, 41, of Coleman, has been
charged with two counts of sexual assault with a deadly weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities had taken a sample of Parks' blood after he was
convicted of a 1995 sexual assault. They compared the sample with
DNA evidence from the 1993 Granbury case.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Parks confessed to the assaults after the DNA
evidence was presented to him.
</P>
<P>
   Using the CODIS software, officials across the nation have made
more than 200 cold hits, said Steve Niezgoda, CODIS program manager
for the FBI. As more states get their databases up and running,
that number should climb substantially, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas began compiling its DNA database in January 1996. Virginia
started its database in 1989 and has collected more than 170,000
blood samples. But only about 11,000 samples have been analyzed,
said Dr. Paul Ferrara, director of Virginia's Division of
Forensics, which manages the state's database.
</P>
<P>
   Like Texas, Virginia started out sampling only violent sex
offenders for placement in the database. It has now been expanded
to include all convicted felons and juveniles 14 or older who
commit the equivalent of a felony. Texas officials say the same
could eventually occur here.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, there were more than 8,000 reported rapes in Texas,
according to the DPS crime reporting division.
</P>
<P>
   ``These databanks are revolutionizing criminal investigations,''
Ferrara said. ``Not only do you have the capability of confirming
that a suspect did or did not commit a crime, you have the
resources to run the DNA profiles from crime scenes where the
police don't have suspects.''
</P>
<P>
   A positive DNA match does not seal a suspect's fate, Ferrara
said, but it does help prosecutors during trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like in any DNA case, it becomes strong evidence,'' he said.
``Because it is such powerful evidence, a lot of time is spent
attempting to attack it.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, DNA evidence has been used to clear people of
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Salazar of Garfield, outside Austin, was convicted in 1992
of raping a pregnant Austin woman and was serving a 30-year
sentence when DNA tests exonerated him of the crime last year.
</P>
<P>
   The technology, like any other form of evidence gathering, is
subject to legal challenge, Ferrara said. Virginia's database law
was challenged in 1990, when opponents contended that the taking of
blood samples was a form of illegal search and seizure and violated
a felon's right to privacy.
</P>
<P>
   But Ferrara said the law was upheld and DNA evidence has never
been seriously challenged in a courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never experienced a situation where the accuracy and
the reliability of DNA evidence was in question,'' he said.
``That's one of the beauties of DNA collection and analysis. It's
based in hard science that has been accepted and endorsed by the
scientific community. It's objective and the results are beyond
dispute.''
</P>
<P>
   But even reliable science is prone to human error.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forensic laboratories are only as good as the quality of
evidence that they get. Where humans are involved, nothing is
absolute,'' Ferrara said.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming the collection and analyzing of blood samples and
crime-scene evidence go smoothly, the chances of linking the wrong
person to a crime are close to zero, said Dr. Dennis Loockerman,
CODIS lab supervisor with the DPS.
</P>
<P>
   The odds are ``about one in 72 billion,'' Loockerman said.
</P>
<P>
   The lab tests nine different locations on the genetic strand.
For a positive link, those nine areas must match up on crime scene
DNA and blood samples, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Matches will become more routine as databases get larger and are
in place for longer periods of time, Ferrara said. But more
resources and personnel could help get the job done faster, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of backlogs, we've been making hits on crimes that are
a year or 2 or 5 or 8 years old,'' Ferrara said. ``It gives you
pause to think, if we had done testing immediately upon receipt of
samples, how many less victims would there be?''

 &HT;    University of Texas football notes
 &HT;    By Mark Wangrin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ricky Williams, who moonlights as a professional baseball player
with the Philadelphia Phillies organization during the summer, is
impressed by home run king Mark McGwire's prowess.
</P>
<P>
   ``McGwire hits a home run every 7.5 at bats,'' Williams said.
``I hit one about every 400 at bats, if that.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said that if he had caught No. 62 he would have donated
it to the Hall of Fame, saying ``What would I do with it? Look at
it?''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he's aware of the pressure McGwire faced in
pursuit of Roger Maris' single-season home run mark, but wouldn't
compare it to what he's faced as the leading preseason Heisman
Trophy candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have good number, maybe I could relate to it later in the
season,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No place like home: Left guard Ben Adams, who hails from the Los
Angeles suburb of LaMirada, Calif., said he returned home for the
July Fourth weekend and got an earful from his friends about last
season's 66-3 loss to UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``They asked questions that really stung me, really hit me in
the heart,'' Adams said. ``They asked, 'Why leave? Why not stay in
the Pac 10? It serves you right to have left.' ... I wanted to kill
them all, but I couldn't do that. They're my friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams is one of six Horns from California, the most notable
being Williams, who attended Patrick Henry High School in San
Diego. The other Californians are sophomore receiver Brandon Healy
(Carlsbad), redshirt freshman quarterback Greg Cicero (Anaheim
Servite), junior punter Greg Murray (Roseville Oakmont) and
defensive back Chad Patmon, a former teammate of Williams at
Patrick Henry.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA has four players from Texas: freshman offensive lineman
Steve Morgan (Dallas Skyline), freshman defensive linemen Sean
Phillips (Missouri City Dulles), redshirt freshman linebacker Ed
Stansbury (El Paso Ervin) and sophomore linebacker Tony White (El
Paso Burges).
</P>
<P>
   Familiar faces: Texas freshman end Jermain Anderson, recently
promoted to second string, might get another shot at one of the
California high school all-stars he faced in the Shrine game this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, playing outside linebacker for Texas, had an
outstanding game but lost out on MVP honors to DeShaun Foster, a
halfback who signed with UCLA and is listed as third team. Anderson
and Foster became friends when they visited Texas on the same
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said we'd see each other on the field and left it at
that,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson played about seven snaps on New Mexico State's last two
series but did not make a tackle. He'll have his work cut out for
him on Saturday because tackle Kris Farris, whom he'll likely face
weighs 315 pounds _ exactly 100 pounds more than the 6-foot-3-inch
Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have to get off quick, get off strong,'' Anderson said.
``I'll try to play games with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Take it back: The Horns and Bruins share one dubious honor,
ranking second and third (behind Illinois) in longest streak
without a kickoff return for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Texas hasn't brought one back since Johnny ``Lam'' Jones went
100 yards against Southern Methodist in 1978, a string of 229
games. The Bruins' last score was by JoJo Townsell against
California in 1980, a string of 205 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Horns may be due. Hodges Mitchell nearly broke two of his
three returns against New Mexico State.
</P>
<P>
   Extra points: The first 10,000 fans entering the Rose Bowl will
receive posters of quarterback Cade McNown, the Bruins' Heisman
Trophy candidate. ... Senior Tony Holmes is likely to split time at
cornerback and strong safety on Saturday, to give starting safety
Donald McCowen a rest and to allow cornerback Jeremy Jones more
playing time. ... Linebacker Aaron Babino said he is encouraged
that the Horns defense can improve despite regressing in the second
half of the New Mexico State game. ``We can tackle. That's why I
feel the defense will be better than last year. Although (New
Mexico State) racked up 500 yards, it was more because of mental
mistakes, which is something we can correct.'' ... UCLA hasn't had
back-to-back winning seasons since '91-93.

 &HT;    Details of Mac's 62nd might fade, like those of a nice dream
 &HT;    By Cheryl Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS, Mo. _ Mark McGwire's red goatee probably will be an
enormous fashion faux pas. His white-and-red St. Louis Cardinals
uniform will look laughingly outdated.
</P>
<P>
   That's one of the best parts of reviewing history on tape. In 37
years, McGwire's 62nd home run might seem as if it happened in a
time as far away as Roger Maris' 61st.
</P>
<P>
   But here's guessing that the next man to break the single-season
home run record, as McGwire did on September 8, won't take as long
as either he or Maris. Babe Ruth set the record of 60 homers in a
season in 1927. Thirty-four years and a world war later, Maris hit
the mark in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, who turns 35 Oct. 1, wasn't even born yet. He's said
all along this season records are made to be broken, or in his
case, smashed. He's already predicting who will break the next
barrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope my son grows up, becomes a baseball player and someday
breaks the record,'' said McGwire of his 10 year-old son, Matt.
</P>
<P>
   It could happen. There are about 10 guys who could hit 50 homers
this season. Chicago Cubs right-fielder Sammy Sosa has 58 and will
also likely surpass Maris' mark.
</P>
<P>
   There are few records in all of sports that stand as seemingly
insurmountable as those in baseball, perhaps because it's the most
steeped in tradition: Lou Gehrig's consecutive game mark that
Baltimore Oriole Cal Ripken, Jr., broke in '95; Pete Rose's 4,192
career hits set in 1985; Hank Aaron's 715th home run.
</P>
<P>
   The single-season home run record was one of the most
tantalizing. Hitting a homer is the hardest thing a batter can do
and also the hardest to predict. Mc-Gwire added a new dimension to
it not only because of the frequency with which he hits them _ one
in just under every eight at-bats _ but the distance they travel.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire reached 60 in 134 games, 20 fewer games than Ruth. He
hit his 61st in his 136th game. Maris did it in his 163rd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was it that quick?'' McGwire said. ``It has been awesome. The
last week-and-a-half my stomach has been turning, my heart has been
beating a million miles a minute. To do it that fast, I don't know.
I just give thanks to the man upstairs and all of them: Roger
Maris, Babe Ruth, everybody who is watching up there. What a
feat.''
</P>
<P>
   It's certainly not over. Cardinals hitting coach Dave Parker and
Sosa both have said they see no reason McGwire can't finish this
season with 70.
</P>
<P>
   So many have been memorable because of their majesty, like the
545-foot shot he hit off Florida Marlins starter Livan Hernandez.
That's why it's kind of ironic his 62nd homer went 341 feet, his
shortest homer of the season. It left the field at Busch Stadium so
quickly, even McGwire missed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Sixty-two) is one swing away and then the next thing you
know, I hit a ball that all of a sudden disappeared on me,''
Mc-Gwire said.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-one was much, much more impressive and gave Mc-Gwire
plenty of time to enjoy the view. It went a much more respectable
430 feet and bounced off the window of a restaurant just below the
upper deck in left field.
</P>
<P>
   That was the longest of his historical home runs, as his 60th
went just 381 feet _ proving that it's not the size that matters.
It's the emotion.
</P>
<P>
   No one who watched will ever forget, not the fans who packed the
stadium, the grounds crew who ran out to retrieve the bases with
McGwire's gigantic footsteps imprinted on them, the players on both
teams, what it was like to watch it all happen.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire was actually the only one who needed a reminder. He'd
dreamed for so long about what it would be like to jog around the
bases after 62, that it actually felt like a dream. The kind you
know was pretty good but you can't quite recall the actual details
when you wake up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really have to see the tape because I really don't remember
it,'' McGwire said.
</P>
<P>
   Watch it soon. While you still look oh, so cool.

 &HT;    Oh well, there goes fan jerky concession
 &HT;    By Greg Stoda
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Suckers.
</P>
<P>
   That's what they think of every customer who has paid to watch
the Florida Marlins play baseball this season.
</P>
<P>
   That's what owner H. Wayne Huizenga and wannabe owner Don Smiley
have thought all along. And it didn't change on a recent afternoon,
either, even when Smiley Don woke up from his dream of buying the
Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   Smiley Don called a news conference in Pro Player Stadium to
announce he was dropping out of the bidding, finally, but still had
the audacity to insist he and Huizengmighty ``could patch together
this deal, (but) we don't think that's in the best interest of
anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Please.
</P>
<P>
   After all the shenanigans and delays he orchestrated either in
concert with Huizengmighty or at the Great and Powerful Oz's
direction, Smiley Don asked all the suckers to be suckers again. He
asked to be thought of as a magnanimous good guy clearing the way
for John Henry, a commodities broker from Boca Raton, to purchase
the Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Smiley Don, as team president, destroyed the
Florida Marlins in the immediate aftermath of the franchise's
stunning World Series triumph last October. And never mind that he
did so because Huizengmighty, who announced in June 1997 his
intention to sell the team, revealed in November _ the month after
that World Series victory _ he would sell to Smiley Don, who wanted
to cut operating costs in order to make any potential deal more
attractive to investors.
</P>
<P>
   Smiley Don either never had the money to make the buy, or
overstated the amount he and his so-called group did have.
</P>
<P>
   The deal died Wednesday only by official announcement. The
truth? There wasn't much reason to believe the deal would ever come
to fruition once concerns about Smiley Don's money, or lack
thereof, began to surface.
</P>
<P>
   Also, there has been some speculation about just how much
Huizengmighty really wanted to unload the team. Huizengmighty's
initial reaction to Henry's announced offer of $150 million in
cash, after all, was tepid.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, Henry's money looks good. So do his promises to
keep the Marlins in South Florida for at least 12 years and build a
stadium with his own money if he doesn't get public assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   Because Smiley Don and Huizengmighty can grab
we-got-the-deal-done coattail credit.
</P>
<P>
   And it didn't take long for Smiley Don to reach for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this thing works out the way it's laid out,'' he said,
``then everybody wins. I knew I either stood up and said what I'm
saying, or we would have been accused of letting a potential buyer
get away who was willing to do some things . . . and that wouldn't
be fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``A quick, smooth closing would be in everyone's best
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Too bad somebody didn't think of that a long time ago.
</P>
<P>
   Smiley Don, though, kept looking for spin. He even went so far
as to announce that Marlins General Manager Dave Dombrowski, who
has been a candidate for the same position with the Los Angeles
Dodgers, had signed a new contract and would be staying with
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   When asked who did the deal, Smiley Don said, ``The Marlins.''
</P>
<P>
   But who are the Marlins? Are they Huizengmighty and Smiley Don?
Or, already, are they Henry, who's likely to replace Smiley Don
with Dombrowski in the president's office?
</P>
<P>
   ``Doesn't matter,'' he said. ``It's the Marlins. It's the
Marlins organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Never give the suckers an even break. Or a straight answer.

 &HT;    Dodgertown may move to cheaper countryside
 &HT;    By Dan Graziano and Clay Lambert
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ The new owners of the Los Angeles Dodgers are
considering moving the team's spring training operation from Vero
Beach, their home away from home for the last 50 years, to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Australian media mogul Rupert Murdoch might as well rip out a
piece of Bob Kost's heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to miss them,'' said Kost, owner of What A Tavern &AMP;
Deli in Vero Beach. ``The Dodgers are the biggest thing Vero has
going. They have citrus, a little bit of Piper (Aircraft) and the
Dodgers.''
</P>
<P>
   Kost's Dodgertown may one day soon be limited to a diet of
citrus fruit and airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   When Murdoch's Fox group bought the Dodgers from the O'Malley
family early this year, it also bought Dodgertown, the quaint,
traditional Vero Beach spring training facility where the Dodgers
have held their spring camp since 1948. Dodgertown is baseball's
only privately owned spring training facility, and the Fox group
worries it will cost too much to operate.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers recently contacted Arizona government officials to
see if any of that state's communities would be willing to finance
a new spring training facility for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team is exploring all of its options, both in Arizona and
Vero Beach,'' Dodgertown Director Craig Callan said. ``It's not an
effort to leave Vero Beach, but just a new ownership group
exploring all the options to get the best possible financial return
on its investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would take a joint effort on behalf of the city,
the county and the Dodgers to put us on a level playing ground with
the other spring training facilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Callan has contacted Vero Beach City Manager Rex Taylor and
Indian River County Administrator Jim Chandler to discuss the
options. Those talks have been so preliminary no one will discuss
what it would take to keep the Dodgers in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm cautiously optimistic, but we still have a lot of hurdles
to jump,'' Callan said. ``The question is, what can the city, the
county and the Dodgers do to retain the Dodgers in Vero Beach when
there are other communities in Arizona and maybe Las Vegas who are
trying to get them as well?''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler said the Chamber of Commerce estimates the Dodgers'
annual impact on the area at around $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona would love to get the Dodgers. One city _ Glendale _
already has expressed interest in being the team's new spring site.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona, though, may be running out of money to finance spring
training sites. Most of the new facilities in the past few years
have been financed by a fee on car rentals. That money is ``dried
up,'' according to Chris Baier, director of the Arizona Office of
Sports Development.
</P>
<P>
   Baier said a new spring facility typically costs about $30
million. Without the car rental fee, a community would have to pay
the entire amount. With the fee, the community would pay about $10
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a challenge for the communities to come up
with a proposal,'' said Baier, who was the first Arizona official
contacted by the Dodgers. ``But because it's the Dodgers, a lot of
people will try to do something to lure them.''
</P>
<P>
   Vero Beach Mayor Carl Peasecq said he is hoping to use Arizona's
own tax scheme in an effort to keep the Dodgers. Pease said he has
talked with state Rep. Charles Semblercq, R-Sebastian, about
legislation that would allow a similar rental car surtax in central
Florida. An August trip to Los Angeles left the mayor hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave us a lot of hope (while we were in L.A.),'' he said.
``I don't know if people in Arizona are just on a fishing
expedition or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Business concerns aside, the Dodgers have to wonder if any other
city would ever adore the team the way Vero Beach does. Or, for
that matter, if the team could ever come to love another city the
way it does Vero Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dodgers give to all of our programs,'' said Patricia
Callahancq, recreation director for the city of Vero Beach. ``They
give equipment, they give time, they give money . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``When my kids were young, we went to every spring training
game,'' she said. ``My kids grew up with Steve Garvey, Ron Cey and
Wes Parker. They would have barbecues for the fans after the games.
Isn't that wild?''
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be a quick break-up. If the Dodgers were to move, it
wouldn't be in time for next year's spring training, and probably
not even by spring of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Callan said the Dodgers will not make a hasty decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is something so important that the Dodgers will
give us a lot of leverage before they do anything.''

 &HT;    REVIEW: Rounders fascinates, engrosses
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A ``rounder'' is a card player who makes his living at the poker
table. He knows all the angles, relying on skill instead of luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is to play the man, not the cards,'' explains Mike
McDermott, a master card player who folds his hand in an attempt to
start a legitimate life as a law student. But not before dropping
$30,000 of his tuition money at the poker table.
</P>
<P>
   Rounders is a fascinating descent into New York City's
high-stakes underground poker world, from seedy ``goulash joints''
_ a restaurant or bar that runs a regular game hidden in the back
room _ to upscale ``carpet'' rooms. Mike (Matt Damon) is our guide,
explaining the rules of the game both on and off the table.
</P>
<P>
   As with director John Dahl's previous films, the acclaimed Red
Rock West and award-winning The Last Seduction , the engrossing
drama is steeped in classic film-noir conventions. Much of the
action takes place in dark or dimly lit rooms. Mike provides almost
constant narration, allowing us to pick up much of the card
players' hard-boiled slang in context. Only at the end does the
film trip up on its own jargon, during a tense but somewhat
repetitive all-or-nothing showdown.
</P>
<P>
   Mike aspires to play in the World Series of Poker, but he
abandons his dream after losing his bankroll to shifty Russian card
shark Teddy KGB (John Malkovich). He promises his girlfriend and
classmate, Jo (Gretchen Mol), that he'll give up the game. His
ability to read poker hands impresses his law school adviser,
Professor Petrovsky (Martin Landau), but Mike nobly refuses to join
the judge's weekly game.
</P>
<P>
   Saying no to his boyhood friend, Worm (Edward Norton), proves
more difficult. Released from prison with a raft of outstanding
gambling debts, Worm is eager to build himself a stake. Mike
vouches for his friend, whom he considers a brother, and is
gradually sucked back into the game, risking his relationship and
legal career.
</P>
<P>
   Worm is an unscrupulous ``mechanic'' who deals from the bottom
of the deck and carelessly runs up more debt, risking both his and
Mike's lives.
</P>
<P>
   For all of its noir trappings, from the corruptible hero to a
sultry femme fatale (Famke Janssen), Rounders is essentially a film
about being true to one's nature. Mike is torn between the promises
he's made and his own desires, and he must gamble it all for his
shot at self-respect.
</P>
<P>
   Damon, a best actor Oscar nominee for Good Will Hunting and
Oscar winner for original screenplay, gives a compelling
performance. His wholesome good looks nicely contrast his
character's often-desperate lifestyle, conveying the poker-faced
elation of holding a winning hand and the gut-twisting shock of
being wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Damon establishes a natural rapport with Norton, a best
supporting actor nominee for Primal Fear . Norton judiciously
avoids overplaying Worm, a slimy wiseguy who sports an ace of
spades tattoo up the sleeve of his Keith Richards wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   Screenwriters David Levien and Brian Koppelman extensively
researched Rounders ' story in New York's underground poker clubs,
which provide many of the film's locations. Damon and Norton also
ventured into the smoky back rooms to learn the skills and
psychological aspects of the game. Both actors were reportedly
invited to play in this year's World Series of Poker, where they
quickly lost.
</P>
<P>
   Rounders ' stellar ensemble cast also includes John Turturro (
The Big Lebowski ) in a wonderfully low-key turn as Mike's cautious
mentor, Joey Knish. Malkovich ( Con Air ) gives an affected but
engaging performance as the eccentric Russian mobster.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Dahl plays a winning hand.

 &HT;    Keiko: free at last?
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jim Leger never watched those ``Free Willy'' films about the
fictional rescue of an abused killer whale, but the
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base employee hardly expected to get
involved in the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Leger is group leader of the Air Transportability Test Loading
Agency at Wright-Pat, and his office is playing a critical role in
the freeing of Keiko, the real killer whale that starred as Willy
in the popular Warner Brothers films. Leger's four-person office
had to figure out how to haul the five-ton mammal _ not to mention
31.5 tons of water, supplies, equipment, and people _ 8,630 miles
from an aquarium in Portland, Ore., to its home waters off Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   Keiko was scheduled to land in Vestmannaeyjar, Iceland, between
4 and 6 a.m. today on an Air Force C-17 transport jet after taking
off from Portland at 9 p.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Leger's office figures out how to make unusual shipments that
don't match the standard loads for Air Force planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get the weird things like satellites, missiles and, in this
case, a whale,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force got involved because the C-17 is the only airplane
that can do the mission. Besides the cargo's large size and heavy
weight, the runway at the airport where Keiko needed to go is only
3,900 feet long _ a little more than half the length of the
shortest runway at Dayton International Airport. It's also a long
flight, expected to take from eight to 10 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The C-17 was designed to haul big, heavy loads over long
distances and land on short airfields. It's also made to balance
unusual load distributions that could make other airplanes
unstable.
</P>
<P>
   Leger said the shifty load was his agency's biggest concern. The
20-foot whale was to be held in a big sling inside a large tank
with water up to his chin.
</P>
<P>
   Baffles were mounted on each end to help keep water from
sloshing out.
</P>
<P>
   Working out the loading details fell to Senior Master Sgt. Pat
Farley, a C-17-qualified loadmaster, and Mark Kuntavanish, the
project engineer. Both men flew to Portland to supervise the
loading, and Leger said Farley was accompanying Keiko on the
airlift, along with the three-person aircraft crew and 28 members
of the Free Willy Keiko Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Keiko was born in the Atlantic Ocean near Iceland in 1977 or
'78, according to the Free Willy Keiko Foundation. He was captured
in 1979 and displayed in a series of aquariums before being sold to
Reino Aventura, an amusement park in Mexico City. Warner Brothers
filmed Keiko in 1992 for the 1993 Free Willy film. But a Life
Magazine feature that November revealed the real Willy _ Keiko _
was suffering chronic health problems because of inadequate
fcYRmities.
</P>
<P>
   Public pressure built to help Keiko. Warner, producers and
environmental advocates created the Free Willy Keiko Foundation to
rehabilitate the whale at the Oregon Coast Aquarium.
</P>
<P>
   Keiko's next home is to be a floating pen in Iceland, where the
foundation hopes the whale will readapt to natural conditions after
nearly two decades of human management.

 &HT;    Pax TV to air some racy UPN shows
 &HT;    By Marguerite M. Plunkett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When television viewers turn to family friendly PAX TV at 11
p.m. in some U.S. markets, they may soon find themselves watching
some unPaxson-like shows instead.
</P>
<P>
   Paxson Communications, the West Palm Beach parent of PAX, and
the UPN network have a program-swapping agreement that allows a
handful of PAX stations to air UPN programs starting Oct. 5, and
vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers who turn on the PAX channel expecting to see family
friendly fare will be faced with shows that may include UPN's 7
Days or the Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer instead of Father
Dowling Mysteries and Heaven Can Wait.
</P>
<P>
   UPN's prime-time shows range from G rated to TV14, which means
recommended for children over 14, according to the UPN network,
which declined further comment. The pilot to 7 Days was rated
TV14V, for violent content.
</P>
<P>
   On the PAX stations that air UPN, PAX signs off before UPN
programming comes on. The viewer will know by the UPN logo on the
screen that they're not watching PAX any longer and therefore won't
expect the PAX-promised programming that's free of sex and
violence, Paxson Chief Executive Officer Jeff Sagansky said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not going to be a problem,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Paxson spokeswoman Lea Sloan said PAX programming is rated for
general audiences, with an occasional rating of parental guidance.
But the network tries to edit out those things that push the rating
to PG, she said. Shows that sometimes are rated PG include Neon
Rider, which airs during prime time Saturday night, and The Love
Boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about extending our coverage,'' Sagansky said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal extends PAX's distribution to an additional 2 percent
of the nation's TV households, Saganskyhe said.
</P>
<P>
   PAX programming will air at various times on UPN affiliates
where Paxson (AMEX: PAX, $10.06) has no broadcast stations or cable
distribution. PAX executives said they did not yet know what the
schedule of shows will be.
</P>
<P>
   PAX stations in Knoxville, Tenn., Grand Rapids, Mich., Albany,
N.Y., Champaign, Ill., and Wilkes-Barre, Pa., will air prime-time
UPN shows from 11 p.m. to 1 a.m., according to Sloan, a time when
children are generally asleep., she added.
</P>
<P>
   UPN stations will air PAX programs on stations in Columbus,
Ohio, Richmond, Va., Harrisburg, Pa., Buffalo, N.Y., and Tucson,
Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Kuzio, an analyst with KDP Investment Advisors in Vermont,
said he wasn't concerned that the UPN deal was an indication that
PAX's concept of family friendly viewing was eroding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expanding reach, ratings and share is important for them. If
this is a creative way to do it, it's good for Paxson,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   PAX, which was launched Aug. 31 as the nation's seventh network,
airs on WPXP-Channel 67 in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Paxson owns, operates or is affiliated with 95 stations in
markets with 76 million TV households.
</P>
<P>
   The shows designed to anchor the new network during primetime
weekdays included Touched by an Angel, Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman,
and Diagnosis Murder.
</P>
<P>
   Original programming on Saturday night includes Neon Rider and
new episodes of Flipper.

 &HT;    Smith says Dayton is ``good place to do business''
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jack F. Smith, chairman and chief executive of General Motors
Corp., says Dayton remains a good place to do business despite the
automaker's constant shuffling of operations and labor turmoil
facing some local plants.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was in Moraine recently to launch a new joint venture with
Isuzu Motors Ltd. to build advanced diesel engines at a new
factory.
</P>
<P>
   After making his formal presentation, Smith spoke briefly with
the Dayton Daily News about the new plant and other issues facing
GM's local work force of 20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Q: GM or any other U.S. automaker hasn't had great success
manufacturing and marketing diesel engines. What makes GM and Isuzu
confident they can convince American drivers that this new diesel
will be better than the older and noisier diesel engines of the
past?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Diesel technology has really advanced and you can hardly
tell what we will manufacture is a diesel engine and that's key.
It's a super engine that is very quiet. It emits a lot less (carbon
dioxide). This engine has a lot going for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: GM has had some good and bad happenings in the Dayton area
for the past three years. How do you view Dayton as a place to
conduct business for GM?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``It's a good place to do business. It is true we have had
some problems here in Dayton, but if you look at what's going on
there are major efforts in these local operations. There is a new
expansion at the Delphi Thermal parts plant (in Moraine), a huge
project at the Moraine truck plant for our new generation sport
utility vehicles and of course the new engine plant with Isuzu. One
certainly has to say that we have invested in Dayton.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does the future hold for two GM brake plants in Dayton
that have faced the threat of sale or shutdown for more than two
years?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``We agreed to go in and study the plant and hopefully that
study will mean we will be able to work together.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What will be the future of the Delphi Chassis parts plant in
Kettering if workers vote down today an agreement that would bring
job security for four years but eliminate about 400 jobs from the
workforce?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``I prefer to be optimistic and believe the agreement will be
ratified.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What assurances can you give the Dayton-area's 15,000 Delphi
workers that the transition will be smooth when Delphi becomes its
own independent company next year?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Delphi is going to be the largest automotive (parts)
company in the world. It's not like it's a small little company
that is struggling. It's a massive operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: But as you know, thousands of workers view working for GM as
the ultimate security blanket.
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Delphi will be the ultimate security blanket. Give Delphi a
chance to grow. Other automakers have hesitated to do business with
Delphi because they are affiliated with General Motors. The growth
opportunity will do wonders for Delphi.

   Description/info: In the controversy over whether sensitive
technology was transferred to China following a crash of a
commercial satellite in the winter of 1996, Republicans have blamed
the Clinton Administration for weakening controls on the export of
commercial satellites by giving the business-friendly Commerce
Department the power to approve satellite licenses. But documents
provided by the White House to the various congressional committees
investigating the matter show that Republicans were pushing for the
very same changes behind the scenes. In fact, one document
indicates that Michael Armstrong, former CEO of Hughes Electronics
Corp. and head of a presidential panel on exports, told White House
officials that he had the support of House Speaker Newt Gingrich.

   BONNIE _ WILMINGTON, N.C. _ Hurricane warnings, which means
dangerous winds and water could arrive within 24 hours, were issued
this morning from Murrells Inlet, S.C., to the North
Carolina-Virginia border. About 200,000 residents and visitors were
told to leave North Carolina's low-lying, exposed Outer Banks today
as Hurricane Bonnie accelerated on a path that could carry its fury
into the barrier island chain. The National Weather Service said
Bonnie's center with its 115 mph wind, moving 11 mph, could be near
the Outer Banks by Wednesday afternoon. By midmorning today, the
storm's eye was centered about 450 miles south of Cape Hatteras,
which sits on the Outer Banks 50 miles south of Nags Head.

bought the Dodgers from the O'Malley family earlier this year, it
also bought Dodgertown, the quaint and traditional Vero Beach
spring training facility where the Dodgers have held their spring
camp since 1948. Dodgertown is baseball's only privately owned
spring training facility, and as such, the Fox group worries it
will cost too much to operate. So, in an effort to explore all
possible cost-reducing options, the Dodgers recently contacted
state government officials in Arizona, to see if any of that
state's communities would be willing to finance a new spring
training facility for them. (Graziano, Lambert, Palm Beach Post)

 &HT;    A fishing pier without peers
 &HT;    By Willie Howard
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ On the morning of May 9, 1980, disaster
struck the Sunshine Skyway Bridge in Florida. The phosphate
freighter Summit Venture rammed a support near the center span. A
bus and several cars plunged 140 feet into Tampa Bay. Thirty-five
people died.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly seven years and $240 million later, a new Sunshine Skyway
opened to traffic, leaving the old bridge fallow. After another
nine years of planning and renovations, what remained of the old
Skyway bridge reopened as fishing piers _ one on the north side of
Tampa Bay near St. Petersburg, another on the south side near
Bradenton.
</P>
<P>
   At 1.6 miles long, the south pier in Manatee County bills itself
as the world's largest fishing pier. For a fee, anglers can drive
onto either of the Skyway piers and fish near their cars.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to drive onto these piers minimizes lugging. Anglers
can load up with rods, coolers, live bait wells and other gadgetry
without fear of a backache. Special parking spaces are set aside
for disabled anglers. And because the piers are run as state parks,
drinking alcohol, loud music, profanity and other disturbances are
not allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Some Skyway anglers listen to music or nap on car seats while
they wait for a bite. Others relax in folding chairs, their rods
lashed to the pier's concrete railing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The accessibility is awesome,'' said Kirk Gurgevich of
Jacksonville, who fished from the south Skyway pier last weekend
with friend Camino Alverez while their wives and children visited
Busch Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   Alverez hauled up a nice gag grouper and flounder from the west
side of the south pier, where rubble from the broken center section
of the old Skyway has been strategically placed to create an
artificial reef.
</P>
<P>
   Anglers who pay attention to tides and drift live bait or
artificial lures in the current can catch Spanish mackerel,
mangrove snapper, cobia, tarpon, snook, spotted sea trout and
blacktip sharks from the Skyway piers. Thom Dandridge, north pier
bait shop clerk, recommends fishing during king mackerel runs in
October.
</P>
<P>
   The Skyway piers are open 24 hours a day, every day of the year.
Overhead lights assist nighttime anglers. Concessionaires who
operate the piers under contract are still working on new
facilities, including permanent restrooms and a new tackle shop for
the south pier.
</P>
<P>
   With two piers extending from the mainland into Tampa Bay, the
inevitable rivalry exists between the north and south, creating a
Civil War of sorts among Skyway pier aficionados. Which pier
produces more fish?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask people who fish the north pier, it's the north
side,'' Dandridge said. ``Ask people who fish the south pier and
it's the south side.

 &HT;    Bettors misplace tickets
 &HT;    By John Crittenden
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bettors at South Florida's three thoroughbred race tracks
misplaced or discarded $1.4 million in winning mutuel tickets
during the last 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   That's an average of more than $27,000 a week in tickets that
never got cashed.
</P>
<P>
   ``And as more simulcasts come in every year, the number of
uncashed tickets gets higher,'' said Ed Mackey, mutuels director at
Hialeah Park.
</P>
<P>
   When Gulfstream went from limited simulcasting to full-card
simulcasting, uncashed ticket totals jumped from $422,991 to
$576,608 for the 10-week winter season.
</P>
<P>
   It's confusing, all those horses racing at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, the process of betting is more complicated, too,
with exactas, trifectas, the ocasional Pick Six, superfectas and
multiple daily doubles.
</P>
<P>
   That leads to more discards of winning tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always surprised by the size of the figure,'' said Ken
Dunn, president at Calder Race Course.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I see it happen every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The size of the amounts involved can be breathtaking.
</P>
<P>
   Early last month, a once-a-week Turf Club customer at Calder
left behind two mutuel vouchers worth a total of $3,500, Dunn said.
On the same day.
</P>
<P>
   Track employees got on the paper trail quickly enough to reunite
the customer and his misplaced vounchers, without the loss of a
penny.
</P>
<P>
   Not every mishap has such a happy ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had one this year that went through the wash,'' said Mackey.
``Every number was gone, I couldn't make out a single digit. It was
a mutuel ticket, all right, but without the number there wasn't
anything we could do.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrons with winning tickets have a year to cash them.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the money from the uncashed winners is split 50-50.
Half goes to the track. Half goes into purses, where it finds it
way into the pockets of horse-owners, trainers and jockeys.
</P>
<P>
   Losing tickets are often thrown down immediately by frustrated
bettors.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the South Florida tracks employs trash-scoopers, on the
move with brooms and dustpans, collecting litter as soon as it hits
the floor. Some discarded tickets go into trash receptacles.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a race develops between the clean-up crew and stoopers
(ITALIC stoopers), as bounty hunters who rake through the discards
for winning tickets are called.
</P>
<P>
   Track security is on the lookout for these ticket-hawks.
Warnings go out. Repeated violations lead to ejection. Stoopers who
insist (ITALIC insist) on rummaging through litter are barred.
</P>
<P>
   In track jargon, the especially aggressive lost-ticket-finders
who mine for gold in garbage cans are called dive-bombers.
</P>
<P>
   Scraps of paper come to the mutuels department in many states of
disrepair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got some tickets by mail from West Palm Beach not long
ago,'' said Mackey, the Hialeah mutuels director. ``They all had
footprints on them, every ticket. But we cashed them. They were
winners.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracks go to surprising lengths to identify winning tickets,
even when they are damaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people to win,'' said Pat Mahony, mutuels manager at
Calder, Tropical and Gulfstream. ``That's what keeps them coming
back as customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they do win, we want them to be able to cash their
tickets. We want them to get what they paid for. We'll look at
every tape, bar code and video to try to find the bet. We'll talk
to the person that sold the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if the ticket is gone, we're helpless.''

 &HT;    UT System to offer online degrees
 &HT;    By Mary Ann Roser
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In a nod to the Internet's increasing influence
on daily life and higher education, the University of Texas System
announced that it is preparing to launch its first online degree
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Starting next fall, Texans, regardless of where they live, will
be able to obtain a master's degree in business administration and
a master's of educational technology without leaving home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a whole different way of teaching'' and a way to ``reach
the citizens of this state,'' said Darcy Hardy, director of the UT
TeleCampus, which is launching the programs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Austin's status as a high-tech mecca and its strong MBA
demand, UT-Austin is the only campus among UT's nine academic
institutions that will not offer an MBA degree online.
</P>
<P>
   Robert May, dean of the graduate school of business, was
traveling Wednesday and could not be reached. His assistant deans
declined to comment and referred questions to May.
</P>
<P>
   Monty Jones, a spokesman for the UT System, said he was told the
Austin campus intends to concentrate on expanding its ``executive
format'' MBA programs to serve nontraditional students. Students in
that program attend classes on two Fridays and Saturdays a month,
which means they must be excused from work on the Fridays.
</P>
<P>
   Many working adults, including some who said they would like to
go to UT, are enrolled in evening-school programs at St. Edward's
University and Southwest Texas State University. UT does not have a
traditional night school that enables people to get degrees while
working full time during the day.
</P>
<P>
   However, UT does offer individual evening classes and is
continuing to expand the number of specific courses it offers on
the Internet. Many other colleges across the country are offering
distance-learning classes.
</P>
<P>
   Less common are degree programs that are totally online.
</P>
<P>
   Of schools in the Austin area, SWT will be the first. It will
offer a master's in applied geography, starting in January.
</P>
<P>
   The UT System's other online master's program, in educational
technology, is being offered through UT-Brownsville, which will
deliver the first 12 hours of courses and award the degrees.
UT-Austin and other system campuses are proposing to teach courses
to cover the other 27 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's providing some critically needed learning opportunities
to teachers and professional educators across the state,'' said
Paul Resta, an education professor and director of the Austin
campus's learning-technology center. ``We're having this rapid
infusion of technology into the schools, and a lot of the
medium-sized and small school districts don't have the
technological leadership to help them.''
</P>
<P>
   Brownsville was chosen to award the degrees because it is the
only UT school that has a specific master's program in educational
technology, Hardy said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she were disappointed that UT-Austin has chosen not to
be involved in the MBA program, Hardy said, ``We'd love to have
everyone involved,'' but ``I feel they have legitimate reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   The other schools have ``excellent programs,'' and while the
degree ``won't have UT-Austin's name on it, it will have the UT
System's,'' Hardy said.
</P>
<P>
   For more information about the online programs, call Hardy's
office at 499-4207 in Austin or toll-free at (888) TEXAS-16.

 &HT;    UT engineers find cheaper way to send data
 &HT;    By Dick Stanley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Technical fixes to reduce the World Wide Wait
are coming into use, but a dramatic reduction in their price could
be around the corner because University of Texas engineers have
connected the dots.
</P>
<P>
   Quantum dots, that is: man-made atoms 20,000 times smaller than
the diameter of a human hair. Quantum dots trap electrical charges,
producing lasers for transmitting digital data.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Deppe, an associate professor of electrical engineering,
and Diana Huffaker, a research associate in electrical engineering,
have for the first time figured out how to make quantum dots
perform as a laser on lower-cost material than they do now.
Moreover, they've done it at the telecommunications industry's
preferred wavelength of 1.3 microns.
</P>
<P>
   The lower-cost material, gallium arsenide, is 10 times cheaper
than the indium phosphide semiconductors now used to make
data-carrying lasers for the fiber-optic technology that
increasingly is used to reduce bottlenecks in the Internet's
growing traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major technical advance,'' said Jack Jewell, a
former AT&AMP;T Bell labs researcher who is now chief technical officer
of Picolight Inc., a Boulder, Colo. startup supplier to the
telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
   Jewell said the UT achievement is only a laboratory
demonstration whose reliability remains to be worked out, putting
it at least two years away from commercialization.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the breakthrough should be a significant spur to
continued industrial research and development with gallium arsenide
semiconductors.
</P>
<P>
   Making lasers on gallium arsenide could make fiber-optic
technology more readily available to homes and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to their uses in Internet data transmission, the
cheap lasers could help improve digital video movie discs; the
read/write CDs used by home and business computers; and even bar
code scanners used for such things as tabulating purchases at
checkout counters.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Deppe said, quantum dot lasers of gallium arsenide
could be useful when computer chip makers move from wire to light
for transmitting information from chip to chip.
</P>
<P>
   Deppe and Huffaker, researchers at UT's Microelectronics
Research Center, are scheduled to announce their achievement today
at the Semiconductor Science and Technology Conference in La Jolla,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   They discussed some details of the work last week in an
unscheduled presentation at a telecommunications conference in
Cannes, France.
</P>
<P>
   Available commercial lasers at the 1.3 micron wavelength are
enabling new optical fiber telephone lines to transmit much more
digital information over longer distances, while maintaining truer
sound and sharper images in high-speed applications. They are an
improvement on the older, slower copper telephone cables that have
caused the Internet's World Wide Web to be dubbed the World Wide
Wait.
</P>
<P>
   But the indium phosphide compound used to produce 1.3 micron
wavelength lasers _ in so-called quantum wells when stimulated with
an electric current _ is not only more expensive but less
heat-tolerant than gallium arsenide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the significant cost savings, the
telecommunications industry has been pushing hard for a gallium
arsenide laser that operates at this wavelength,'' Deppe said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have experimented with quantum dots before, but
making them is tricky. The UT researchers use a process called
molecular beam epitaxy which allows them to make single atomic
layers of a material one at a time.
</P>
<P>
   They used the process to make their quantum dots from indium
gallium arsenide in cavities on a gallium arsenide semiconductor,
similar to the way water droplets form on a shower curtain.
</P>
<P>
   Huffaker said the atoms assemble themselves in clusters of about
10 million each in the cavities. When an electric current is
injected into a cavity, the electrons combine with the quantum dots
to generate light. The light bounces back and forth in the
cavities, she said, exciting further emissions of light from the
dots, which produces the laser.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the remaining reliability problems, the UT development
is attracting industry financing for continuing the 18-month-old
research that so far has been paid for with a $50,000 grant from
the State of Texas Advanced Research program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a company that's very interested,'' Deppe said. ``But
I'm not at liberty to give the name.''

   1. KEN STARR WOULD NOT BE DENIED By Michael Winerip From The New
York Times Magazine - 8.700 words or four-excerpt option -
Especially recommended With another special prosecutor, things
might have turned out differently. As it is, Ken Starr's character
has forever changed President Clinton's destiny. Is it true that
the Ken we see now is not the Ken Starr some people once knew? Is
there really a new Ken Starr? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------2. RELEASE THE STARR
REPORT TO THE PUBLIC AS SOON AS POSSIBLE By John D. Dingell - an
Op-Ed from The New York Times - 800 words The author, a Democrat
and U.S. representative from Michigan says why he thinks Kenneth
Starr's report should be released in full to the public and the
press at the earliest possible moment. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------3. A CLEANER HARBOR
LURES WATER BIRDS TO NEW YORK By Jane E. Brody From The New York
Times Science Times - 2.000 words In the last two decades,
undeterred by PCBs, noise, smells and other pollutants, exploding
populations of herons and egrets, glossy ibises and double-crested
cormorants have joined the ubiquitous gulls that call the New York
harbor home. Although to humans, several of the harbor islands and
their environs may look like slums, to the birds they resemble an
Everglades paradise, replete with food and nesting sites and free
of threats from people, racoons and most other predators. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------4. DRUGS ARE BETTER
THAN DIET ALONE IN TREATMENT OF DIABETES By MIchael McCarthy from
The Lancet News Service Patients with type 2 diabetes, so-called
adult onset diabetes, who take drugs to lower their blood sugar are
less likely to develop many of the common complications of diabetes
than are patients who only changed their diets, British researchers
report this week. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------5. SURVIVORS FROM MARS
- ARE WE ALL MARTIANS? by Paul Davies from New Scientist Battered
by meteorites, the early Earth was no place for life to take hold.
But our most primitive ancestors could have found refuge on the
planet next door... 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------6. FACING THE SEAMY
SIDE OF ECONOMIC FAILURE By Flora Lewis - 800 words The long taboo
word worruption is now front and center at international
conferences on development, no longer the dirty word no one is
prepared to acknowledge. This is a notable advance, because it is
leading to some practical exchanges on how to deal with it. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------7. NEEDLES AND NERVES

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Affirmative action's reprieve is good news all
around.
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It looks as though we'll be able to get out of the year without
having to watch affirmative action being killed after all, and a
new study makes it plain why the reprieve is good news all around.
</P>
<P>
   Affirmative action at our leading colleges and universities has
been ``the backbone of the emergent black middle class.'' It has
advanced workplace racial integration, and it has seeded black
communities still disproportionately poor with able and involved
citizens who serve as ``strong threads in a fabric that binds their
own community together and binds those communities into the larger
social fabric as well.''
</P>
<P>
   This from Derek Bok and William Bowen, respectively the former
presidents of Harvard and Princeton. They studied the records of
45,000 students from 28 institutions going back 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Their findings: minority students spotted a few admission points
generally enter with lower grades and test scores than their white
classmates and have a lower graduation rate and lower grades in
college _ no surprise in any of that _ but affirmative action
graduates earn advanced degrees at rates equal to white graduates
and are slightly more likely than whites to earn professional
degrees in law, medicine, business and so on.
</P>
<P>
   In short, most succeed and prosper.
</P>
<P>
   We started this year with affirmative action doing the victim
walk, bearing a fatalism that all but invited political mugging.
Programs had been ended at California and Texas campuses. Populist
and ideological mobs in state legislatures were ganging up on it.
Many congressional Republicans were openly eyeing it as a way to a
New Jim Crow majority while posturing as ``colorblind.''
</P>
<P>
   Two factors intervened. The virtual disappearance of black and
Hispanic students from the entering classes of the top Texas and
California schools sobered even many of the political sleazes who
had figured they could grandstand for backlash whites without much
social harm. And second-round polling showed that the apparent
broad disaffection from affirmative action was illusory; it
depended mainly on how the questions were worded.
</P>
<P>
   Racism is not all the barrier it once was _ and certainly isn't
the universal debility that hustlers who cry racial wolf make it
out to be _ but it remains a palpable presence in American life,
not surprisingly after nearly 400 years of disfiguring slavery,
segregation and prejudice. The accumulated disadvantages handicap
even the most privileged African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Affirmative action is a measured way to accelerate our common
escape, black and white, from the social damages of that history
and of its restraining residue.
</P>
<P>
   The practice is old hat; only its name and racial application
are recent. For years, and ironically, Ivy League schools enrolled
indifferently qualified whites from the South in the name of
geographical diversity. Schools routinely look at the
extracurricular activities of applicants to shape a socially
balanced student body.
</P>
<P>
   How foolish it would be _ and as the Bok-Bowen study shows, how
wounding _ if we were now to declare race the only nonacademic
factor that admissions programs can not take into account.

FOCUS WAS FAR DIFFERENT FOR MARIS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Includes Maris '61 home run text table.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Things were different when Roger Maris stalked Babe Ruth's home
run record in the summer of 1961. Certainly, there was a lot of
attention on Maris's march toward the magic number, but it was
nothing like what Mark McGwire just experienced on his journey to
62.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, the home attendance at Maris's final three
games in Yankee Stadium. Even though Maris was already tied with
Ruth at 60, the three weekend crowds at Yankee Stadium were 21,485,
29,182, and 23,154 respectively.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most telling indicator that those were different
times was that Maris actually took a day off after tying Ruth in
the 158th game.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, folks. The mighty Roger hit No. 60 off Baltimore's
Jack Fisher (the same man who surrendered Ted Williams's final
homer on the last day of the 1960 season) in game No. 158, then
came to the park the next day and asked manager Ralph Houk if he
could go home.
</P>
<P>
   This wild folklore is chronicled in Tony Kubek and Terry Pluto's
marvelous book, ``Sixty One,'' written in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, the new (at least until Sammy Sosa catches him) home
run king, took the pressure off himself by crushing four homers in
two days in the first week of September. Big Mac had 59 homers with
23 games remaining, giving him plenty of cusion to hit more for the
record. When he hit No. 60 Saturday, he needed only two more with
21 games to play. He did not ask for a day off and broke Maris's
mark with 18 games left.
</P>
<P>
   Can anyone imagine McGwire hitting No. 61 in Game 158, then
taking a day off before resuming the chase? Certainly, Fox TV and
ESPN would have discouraged Big Mac from taking a rest as he stood
on the threshold of the record. The networks spent money and
inconvenienced many people, changing times of games in order to
make sure McGwire's feat was carried on live television.
</P>
<P>
   Maris might not have played ball with the networks. According to
Kubek and Pluto's book, the Yankee slugger walked into Houk's
office on the day of Game 159 and said he couldn't stand it
anymore. He wanted the day off. When Houk asked what he was
supposed to tell the media, Maris reportedly told his manager,
``Tell them I went fishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Houk told the writers, ``I certainly think Roger is entitled to
a day off. He's been through a pretty rough ordeal ... Roger's
exhaustion isn't physical, it's mental. He hasn't had a moment's
peace in the last month. It's all new to him. He hasn't been
trained for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Maris was surprised that missing a game was such a big deal. It
made him angry, especially since he'd been criticized for failing
to catch Ruth within the 154-game framework of Ruth's time.
</P>
<P>
   According to future Cardinals teammate Mike Shannon, Maris said,
``I can't win for losing with you guys. First, you say I've played
too many games to break the record. Then I don't play and you ask
how I could miss a game when I'm going for the record.'
</P>
<P>
   It certainly wouldn't have flown in this wacky season of 1998.
Once he got into the high 50s, there were no days off for
baseball's new home run king.
</P>
<P>

HOME RUN DERBY
</P>

CANSECO SAYS HE KNEW MCGWIRE COULD DO IT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was the more glamorous of the Bash Brothers, the
neck-twitching, race-car-driving, pistol-packing slugger with a
matinee idol's flair who could hit a baseball as far as anybody in
the game, including Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   But while McGwire has taken on the stature of myth, Jose Canseco
became just another hired bat, betrayed by a cranky back,
overdeveloped hamstrings, and a me-first reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Canseco arrived in Oakland in 1986 and was American League
Rookie of the Year. McGwire arrived in 1987 and hit 49 home runs,
the most ever by a first-year player. He, too, was named Rookie of
the Year, and the Bash Brothers were born.
</P>
<P>
   The next season, 1988, Canseco hit 42 home runs and stole 40
bases, an unprecedented display of power and speed that accorded
him the distinction of becoming baseball's first 40-40 man. The A's
went to the World Series, and Canseco, who at 24 was one year
younger than Nomar Garciaparra is now, was named the American
League's Most Valuable Player.
</P>
<P>
   The next season, he hurt his back, and the decade that has
ensued has had more downs than ups for Canseco, who drifted from
Oakland to Texas to Boston back to Oakland before signing last
winter as a free agent with the Toronto Blue Jays at a fraction of
the money he made in his glory years. There, at age 34, he is
enjoying his best season in nearly a decade for the Blue Jays,
entering play tonight with 41 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, meanwhile, has had a season for the ages, breaking
Roger Maris's home run record with his 62d Tuesday night in St.
Louis. Surprised by the turn history took?
</P>
<P>
   Canseco, for one, said he wasn't. Last weekend in Toronto, he
said he never thought Maris's record would fall, but if it did,
McGwire would be the one to break it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark McGwire to me is the most dominating power hitter
baseball has ever seen,'' Canseco said. ``Maybe in your lifetime
and your children's lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though McGwire turns 35 Oct. 1, Canseco said that in his
mind, the Cardinals first baseman has a chance at Hank Aaron's
record of 755 career home runs. The math would seem to suggest
Canseco is way off on this one. McGwire, the first man ever to hit
50 or more home runs in three consecutive seasons, has 449 for his
career. He'd have to average 50 home runs for the next six seasons,
until he's 41, to approach Aaron.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could break it,'' Canseco insisted. ``I truly believe that
if he wanted to stick around that long, he could do it, no doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that Maris's record has fallen, Canseco believes McGwire can
take aim at another number this season. ``Seventy home runs? For
him, it's possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``For (Sammy) Sosa (who has 58), this is a once-in-a-lifetime
thing. McGwire, he could do this every year. He's incredible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The owners should get together and make him the highest-paid
player in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, first of all, the man's size, Canseco said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys don't understand _ Mark McGwire is huge,'' said
Canseco, himself a chiseled 6-foot-4-inch, 240-pounder. ``The man
has 22-inch forearms. With any other man, those are a bodybuilder's
arms. They're four times as big as mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, a little exaggeration from Canseco. McGwire's forearms
have been measured at 17 inches, still huge by anyone's standards.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the size, Canseco said, this is why McGwire dared go
where Canseco was unable to follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``My eye was never as good as Mark's,'' he said. ``I'm an
aggressive hitter. I swing at pitches out of the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to have a tremendous eye. He has a high-average
hitter's type eye and he still puts a swing on the ball. I call
that smooth power, smooth torque.''
</P>
<P>
   It is so easy to be deceived by McGwire when he hits a home run,
according to Canseco.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard as hell to hit a home run. It's not easy at all,''
he said. ``He just makes it look easy. He makes it look effortless.
But beyond everything, that's because of his eye and his technique,
which is perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``His technique is consistent all the time. He's not changing
his stance, he's not changing his swing. He knows to stay within
his zone and take what he can get.''
</P>
<P>
   Canseco, who in the past had been accused of steroid use _ he
pointed at his biceps in Fenway Park when fans chanted,
``Ster-oids, Ster-oids,'' at him in the late '80s _ laughed when
someone mentioned McGwire's use of the supplement androstenedione.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andros?'' Canseco said. ``That stuff don't work. All that
stuff is doing is making that product sell a hundredfold more.
Andros? Yeah, I tried it. All it did was make me huge.''
</P>
<P>
   Rickey Henderson, the future Hall of Famer who played with both
McGwire and Canseco in Oakland, told Bay area reporters this week
that he thought Canseco would have been the one to break Maris's
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jose was brash,'' Henderson said. ``He didn't care what people
thought and he hit the ball harder than anyone I've ever seen. Mark
was more reserved. He didn't give his body up on every play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jose had that approach. He played all out from the beginning.
Mark learned to do that. Jose didn't care about the media and the
limelight. He just wanted to play ball and didn't care what people
thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Jose hadn't had all those injuries, I honestly think he
would have broken the record.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Canseco agreed, the injuries took their toll. But McGwire
had his physical problems, too, most notably heel injuries that
robbed him of the better part of two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, he's my idol,'' Canseco said. ``Incredible. And it
couldn't happen to a nicer guy.''

HERO IS BACK ON THE JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; CINCINNATI _ The journey is just beginning for Mark McGwire.
Ready or not, he's America's No. 1 sports hero. More than any
baseball player since Babe Ruth, he has emerged as a role model for
millions of people who last summer didn't even know his name.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 24 hours after he made major league history by hitting
his 62d homer and breaking Roger Maris's 37-year-old season record
Tuesday night in St. Louis, the Cardinals strongman was back on the
job Wednesday night against the Reds. But it wasn't the same. It
won't ever be again. At 34, McGwire has ascended to bona fide
legend. That he fully understands what has happened in his life is
doubtful. But he's enjoying it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've amazed myself by doing this,'' he said at a
pregame press conference, the kind he routinely held while chasing
Maris. ``But when I sit back in the offseason and watch the
playoffs and World Series, that is when it will truly hit me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody says, `Enjoy it.' I'm reminded by players that
nobody knows if I will ever be up here again. So I'm not going to
stop what I'm doing. I'll do my work that I need to do until the
last out of the season. That's just the way I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering all that had happened to him in the last five days,
it was a wonder McGwire had the strength to sit up, much less deal
with a long list of concerns following his historic homer. Some
suggested he had better check the 1999 schedule and map out his off
days a month in advance.
</P>
<P>
   So many people want to see this man now. Cinergy Field was
filled (51,969) Wednesday night for a meaningless game in
mid-September. Out of a sense of duty, McGwire played three
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to have one or two at-bats,'' he said. ``When you've
got 50,000 fans out there, you've got to make some sort of
showing.''
</P>
<P>
   He went 0 for 2, then left the game, a 6-3 Reds win. But that
was OK. The fans will be back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just because he hit his 62d home run,'' said Reds
manager Jack McKeon. ``A lot of people just want to see McGwire in
person, whether he hits one or not. I would have loved to see Babe
Ruth play. What you have here is the same scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   After hitting his record home run, McGwire had a long night that
ended around 4:30 a.m. Wednesday following the team flight from St.
Louis. He didn't get much sleep. So much was spinning in his head.
And there were the interruptions. President Clinton called to
congratulate him for his fourth-inning smash, which triggered a
postgame ceremony like no other player in history had received.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire had said goodbye to his son, Matthew, who had arrived
from his California home in time for homer No. 61, which tied
Maris, and the big one off Cubs righthander Steve Trachsel that
virtually guarantees McGwire's entrance into the Baseball Hall of
Fame _ the ball, bat, and jerseys of both Mark and Matthew are
already there.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least I won't have to hear any more questions about can I
do it,'' said McGwire. ``I've done it. By spring training, all I
will hear is can I do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't be misled. McGwire is enjoying himself as much as
anyone can under a nationwide magnifying glass. Still, he intends
to focus on the task at hand rather than the achievement in the
book.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because of what I've done with the record doesn't mean I
stop,'' he said. ``I've got two weeks left. I will be swinging the
bat and trying to be aggressive. Let's see where it ends up. I'll
play. There are enough off days so that I should be able to be in
every game. I feel pretty good. That's the bottom line. I still
want to finish strong.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 12 years, McGwire has been in all kinds of situations. He
has one World Series ring. He was with Oakland for three American
League championships. Starting in 1991, he was saddled with back
and heel injuries for a couple of wasted years. Nobody has to tell
him about the highs and lows of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a pretty strong person,'' he said. ``And with the pressure
of all the eyes _ media and players and America _ watching you, it
can get rough. But I had to keep my stroke. It's easy to lose it
and get caught up in other things. Luckily, I just happen to hit my
second wind at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire is divorced. His ex-wife, Kathy, lives in California and
has custody of Matthew. Wednesday he heard himself described as a
role model. It had meaning for him, but perhaps not what people
think.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a role model for parents means simply be who you are,''
he said. ``And this is who I am. I'm a single parent that loves my
son to death. Be a role model for my son? How much more joy can you
get when your son shows up just in time for your first at-bat and I
hit my 61st home run? He got to see my 62d.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my son understands a lot. The expression in his eyes
and his face says it all. He was laughing the whole time I was
hugging him (Tuesday night). It's so cool to think that he got to
see it. I'm not the No. 1 hero. If the people of America want me
also to be a role model to the kids, so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens the rest of the way, said McGwire, he is
not going to second-guess himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every player has doubts,'' he said. ``There was a time after
the All-Star break I got really, really tired. I probably should
have taken some time off. We elected not to do so. There's always
some period that you struggle. I did but I got my second wind and
started feeling good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still floating. But if you believe in dreams, if you
believe in yourself as far as climbing the mountain when you have
adversity, you're going to be all right. It would have been easier
for me to turn around and never be heard of again. But I decided to
conquer it.''

BASEBALL RETURN POLICY IS REALLY NO BARGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's official: Our country has lost its Midsection. This is not
a good thing. Its perspective is next. You should be frightened.
Middle America _ Missouri, really _ is not well. Be careful. This
could turn into an E.coli epidemic or something. If you must leave
the security of home, please be certain to travel in a group of
friends. And if they ask you to meet them somewhere, make sure it's
at least a couple of hundred miles from St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   You know America is upside down when the Internal Revenue
Service is on record as making the sanest baseball decision of the
past few days. Earlier this week, the uptight federal paper-pushers
announced that they would tax the fortunate person catching and
giving away Mark McGwire's record-setting 62d home run ball. Why?
Because the historic ball could be worth up to $1 million, and even
passing it off to the St. Louis Cardinals slugger could be akin to
giving someone a $625,000 gift. That's ridiculous, isn't it? The
IRS realized that, too. About 24 hours after voicing its foolish
tax plans, the organization was raising its hands and saying, ``My
bad,'' to the rest of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   So, yo, Deni Allen, Mike Davidson, and Tim Forneris. What are
you waiting for?
</P>
<P>
   In the past four days, Allen, Davidson, and Forneris caught
McGwire home run balls No. 60, 61, and 62. All returned them. I can
respect that, even if I don't agree with it. The men also made the
argument that the ball did not belong to them, that it was truly
the property of McGwire and baseball. If I were to say I disagree,
I would be understating; I think it's nuts.
</P>
<P>
   We can all agree that no one owns a baseball once it goes out of
play, right? A ball goes over the fence and the fastest person to
the landing spot has the right to pocket it. McGwire said he
believes in fate. I don't know the people who briefly held history,
but maybe they should start believing in fate, too. They all had
their hands on an object that the country deemed important. Even if
they had no plans to sell, they all had the right to take the ball
home, put it on a shelf, or use it in a neighborhood pickup game if
they wanted. But we should all consider this: McGwire has no more
claim to No. 62 than Cubs pitcher Steve Trachsel, who threw the
pitch. Or Scott Servais, who was planning to catch it. Or Forneris,
a member of the Cardinals grounds crew, who retrieved the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The bat? Now, that's understandable. It was the 33-ounce
protagonist in this historic tale. And it belongs to McGwire. But
the ball is always the neutral object in the pitcher-batter
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you are among those who believe that giving back the ball
is a refreshing switch for a morally decaying America. Maybe you
believe that this was an act of philanthropy, one American reaching
out to another, when the predictable thing to do _ when the
American thing to do _ would be to hold out for major cash (since
we're on the subject, McGwire can certainly afford it). Do not be
confused. This is not a story of philanthrophy. It's a glimpse of
celebrity. And sports idolatry.
</P>
<P>
   I have always argued that baseball would not be the American
pastime if most Americans had a chance to interact with the average
baseball player away from the field. That's not to say baseball
players are worse than your neighbors. In fact, on the average,
they are just like them. The major difference is that your neighbor
probably has a smaller bank account and is not cheered by 30,000
people every day at work. But haven't you heard baseball players
tell you at contract time that they have to do what's best for
their families? Haven't you heard them say they want market value
for their services and that it's not personal, just business?
</P>
<P>
   It should have been the same for Davidson. As I said, I have
never met the man. But I did see where he sometimes works 80 hours
a week and that his wife is pregnant. I wonder what Mrs. Davidson
said to her husband when they were alone, far from the boom mikes
and commentary praising him for doing what was right. I wonder if
she was truly excited for him. I wonder if Forneris's friends were
truly thrilled when they saw him beaming behind McGwire on national
TV.
</P>
<P>
   There is a concrete island at the corner of Melnea Cass
Boulevard and Massachusetts Avenue, near Boston City Hospital.
Sometimes I drive by there. I always see people with cups in their
hands, asking for pennies, dimes, and quarters, anything you can
spare. Sometimes I give; sometimes I don't. That's not the point.
But I wonder if the same people who, in effect, support
$100,000-to-$1 million baseball giveaways would be so generous to
give $2 to the people on the corner. Would they give away their $1
million lottery tickets, too?
</P>
<P>
   Returning a pricey baseball to an athlete is not refreshing.
It's sickening. It's the American phenomenon of doing for the
famous what you might not do for your next-door neighbor. It's the
puzzling action of restaurateurs and clothiers who invite
millionaires to their businesses and let them eat for free.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, by most accounts, is a nice man. But Allen, Davidson,
and Forneris should go up to the 250-pounder, look him in his eyes,
and say, ``Mr. McGwire, I think you have something that belongs to
me.''

THEY'VE ALL CHASED RUTH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Includes 50 home runs text table.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RICHARDSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Babe Ruth slammed a slow curve from the Yankees' Bob
Shawkey over the right-field grandstand of the Polo Grounds on
Sept. 24, 1919, headlines in the Boston newspapers trumpeted the
event. Even the New York Times waxed rhapsodic about the clout.
</P>
<P>
   The blast was the 24-year-old Red Sox outfielder's 28th of the
season, topping the 27 home runs hit by Ned Williamson in 1884. The
Bambino was now baseball's single-season home run king, a title he
would hold for 42 years.
</P>
<P>
   Not as obvious at the time was that Ruth's 1919 season had
changed the game forever, kindling a fascination with numbers that
reached its zenith Tuesday when Mark McGwire socked his
record-setting 62d home run.
</P>
<P>
   The Babe did not invent the home run, nor was he the first to
gain glory from the long ball. Nineteenth-century sluggers Charlie
Duffee and Ed Breckenridge bore the nickname ``Home Run,'' and
Frank ``Home Run'' Baker won himself immortality and his
Philadelphia Athletics the World Series with home runs off New York
Giants aces Rube Marquard and Christy Mathewson in 1910. What set
Ruth apart was excess: his prodigious home runs (the Globe
described his 28th as the ``most sensational hit ever at the Polo
Grounds'') and their abundance.
</P>
<P>
   When Boston manager Ed Barrow began playing the Babe, twice a
20-game winner as a pitcher, in the outfield when he wasn't on the
mound, few could cite the record for home runs in a major league
season. Once Ruth had equaled Gavvy Cravath's 24 homers for the
Phillies in 1915, it was recalled that Buck Freeman had socked 25
for Washington in 1899. Then Williamson's 27 came to light.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson was an outstanding player, perhaps the best shortstop
between the reigns of George Wright and Hughie Jennings, but his
feat was a fluke. The White Stocking had been the beneficiary of a
180-foot left-field fence and a change in the ground rules at
Chicago's Lakefront Park that made home runs of drives that were
doubles the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Williamson's total became Ruth's final target.
Babe matched it Sept. 20 with a walk-off smash at Fenway Park that
cleared the left-field wall and soared through a window in a
Lansdowne Street building. He added the Polo Grounds shot and
another homer in Washington before the season closed.
</P>
<P>
   That winter, Red Sox owner Harry Frazee, capitalizing on the
sudden increase in value of his young slugger to finance his
theatrical enterprises, sold Ruth's contract to the Yankees for
$125,000 plus a $350,000 loan secured by a mortgage on Fenway Park.
That transaction haunts the Boston franchise to this day.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth blossomed in New York. His salary was doubled to $20,000,
and he responded by nearly doubling his home run total,
flabbergasting the baseball world and deflecting attention from the
developing Black Sox scandal by slamming 54 homers in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   Though Ruth would match or top that total three times during the
decade, his 1920 season was his most dominant. He batted .376 and
had a slugging percentage of .847, still the major league mark. Not
only was Ruth's home run total nearly triple that of runner-up
George Sisler (19) of the St. Louis Browns _ National League leader
Cy Williams hit 15 _ but Babe also outhomered every other major
league team except Williams's Phillies, who had 64.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth's ``can't top this'' phase continued with 59 home runs in
1921, another awesome offensive season in which he batted .378,
slugged .846, drove in 177 runs, and led the Yankees to their first
American League pennant. After four less spectacular seasons,
including one (1922) shortened by a 39-day suspension and another
(1925) that began June 1 after a life-threatening abdominal
illness, Ruth raised the bar a final time in 1927, smiting the 60
homers indelibly associated with his name. He hit 54 the following
year, then led the AL for three seasons more, but never made
another run at Olympus.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth had set a lofty target, one that wasn't matched or topped
until 1961 when Roger Maris added the number 61 _ and the asterisk
_ to baseball's lexicon. Ruth's record of 60 lasted 34 years, but
not for want of challengers.
</P>
<P>
   The first threat came in 1930, in the unlikely form of Hack
Wilson, whose record of 190 runs batted in was thought to be in
peril earlier this season. The Cubs outfielder with the fireplug
physique (5 feet 6 inches, 190 pounds) walloped 56 homers, the NL
mark until Mark McGwire, then Sammy Sosa, stormed past last week.
However, Wilson never quite got 60 in his sights, hitting four home
runs in his last five games. His 55th and 56th came in the season's
penultimate game. In the finale, he managed two singles against the
Reds at Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   The next suitor, the Philadelphia Athletics' Jimmie Foxx, also
closed with a rush, belting six homers in his last eight contests.
The 6-foot, 195-pound first baseman with bulging biceps and cutoff
sleeves that were a precursor of McGwire's hit his 58th in the
ninth inning of the 1932 season finale at Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In 1938, baseball's Holy Grail looked tantalizingly within
reach. The Tigers' Hank Greenberg socked his 57th and 58th home
runs in the second game of a doubleheader against the Browns in
Detroit Sept. 27. He had five games to tie Ruth's mark. However,
the 6-3 1/2, 210-pound first baseman had just one hit in two more
games vs. St. Louis, then went homerless in three contests at
Cleveland, including a season-ending doubleheader at cavernous
Municipal Stadium. Interestingly, Greenberg's quest merited only
one-column headlines and brief accounts in the Boston papers, being
overshadowed first by Gabby Hartnett's ``Homer in the Gloaming,'' a
ninth-inning blast that virtually handed the Cubs the NL pennant,
then by Bob Feller's record 18 strikeouts against the Tigers.
Greenberg was 1 for 4 vs. Feller and had three singles in the
nightcap. Foxx, now with the Red Sox, hit two home runs the final
weekend to finish with 50, marking the first time two players had
reached that milestone in the same season.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent sluggers never really put Ruth's mark in jeopardy
until Maris staked his claim. Pirates outfielder Ralph Kiner
reached 54 in 1949 with 16 home runs in the final month and matched
Cardinals first baseman Johnny Mize with 51 in 1947. The Giants'
Willie Mays hit 51 in 1955, and the Yankees' Mickey Mantle belted
52 a year later after entering September with 47.
</P>
<P>
   Following Maris and Mantle's well-chronicled assault, Mays
(1965) and the Reds' George Foster (1977) hit 52, and Cecil Fielder
of the Tigers ripped 51 in 1990 before 50-homer seasons became
almost commonplace in recent years _ Albert Belle (50) in '95,
Brady Anderson (50) and McGwire (52) in '96, Ken Griffey (56) and
McGwire (58) in '97.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 79 years after Babe Ruth reshaped the game, baseball has a
new home run king and a new magic number (62 ... and counting).
Watch out, Joe Bauman.

CAPTIVATING QUEST RESTORED POWER TO FADING SPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the end, after a six-month odyssey of questions,
expectations, and tape-measure home runs, what struck hardest was
Mark McGwire's humanity.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's saga made grown men cry. His quest for the
single-season home run rec-ord united all of baseball, all of
sporting America, and a large portion of the nation, not to mention
the world. It was the infrequent global event with an upbeat
ending. Everyone was rooting for the guy, and folks not generally
taken with sports suddenly found themselves asking whether the
Cardinals' game was going to be on Fox or ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   This was a baseball story that attracted millions of women and
children, people long disenfranchised and disenchanted with
professional sports. Here was a mammoth professional athlete who
was man enough to admit he'd sought therapy, man enough to
acknowledge his former wife, and man enough to weep on national
television. Divorce is a frequent and too often ugly reality in our
country, but Mark and his son, Matt, showed that life can go on and
still be good.
</P>
<P>
   The fans responded by showering McGwire with something all too
rare in sports today: affection accompanied by good manners. A
troika of ball retrievers made history by nabbing the famed home
run balls, then made history again by returning them to the hitter.
Is that a comment on St. Louis? On the great Midwest? Or on the
unselfish goodwill pitched toward McGwire in his crowning moment?
</P>
<P>
   First up was the Rams employee who caught No. 60. He traded his
ball for a chance at batting practice and an autographed jersey.
No. 61 landed with a guy using his brother-in-law's tickets on
Labor Day. He said he wanted nothing, even though he works 80 hours
a week and his wife is expecting their third child. Finally, a
grounds crew member came up with No. 62 and, in keeping with the
spirit of the event, put down his rake, ran to McGwire, and
presented him with the $1 million baseball.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, baseball was reborn this summer. It's been
fashionable to kick the national pastime in recent years. Since the
strike of 1994, baseball has been scorned or rendered irrelevant,
but now a new generation of hardball disciples has joined the
legion of aging fans who remember when the game was a part of the
daily routine in America.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire is the reason. And Sammy Sosa. Their joint press
conference Monday morning goes down as one of pro sports' sweetest
displays of sportsmanship and brotherhood. The mutual respect
spilled onto the field in the form of shared salutes. Their bond
deflated the silly notion that race played any part in America's
rooting interest. Sosa was, and remains, an important part of the
story. And most American youngsters probably would have been
happiest if Ken Griffey had hit record-breaking No. 62 first.
</P>
<P>
   No part of the McGwire story disappointed. He hit magic No. 62
in front of his home fans, in front of his parents and son, in
front of Sosa, and in front of Roger Maris's family. Maris's grown
sons bear a striking, almost haunting resemblence to the old man,
and McGwire honored Maris by embracing the former home run king's
children.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire is not a perfect man and is the first to admit it. As
with all celebrities, our knowledge is superficial. He's amazing at
the plate, and for now, that's enough. Recent history proves that
it's best not to elevate anyone too high, lest he or she sink from
feet of clay.
</P>
<P>
   But the facts on his side include staying in St. Louis, taking
the ``hometown discount'' rather than going for top dollar last
winter. He do-nates a portion of his salary to help abused
children. He's respectful of his teammates and opponents. We know
he shares a sense of history. He shows his son affection in public.
We also know he knows he's flawed.
</P>
<P>
   So the celebration continues _ the home run tour of 1998. We may
never see anything like it again. Mark McGwire's home run run was
about as perfect as it gets.

MCGWIRE HAD A BLAST _ AND SO DID THOSE WHO WATCHED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine being asked to perform a truly formidable physical task.
Then imagine attempting to meet a self-imposed artificial deadline.
</P>
<P>
   That is what Mark McGwire has just done, and that is why the
events of this past week in St. Louis represent the greatest
regular-season story in the history of American sport.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire arrived back home Friday needing three home runs to
eclipse Roger Maris's 37-year-old record of 61 in a season. He
would have three games against Cincinnati and two against Chicago
before heading back on the road. He made up his mind that he would
get those home runs in St. Louis, before the people he routinely _
and, by the way, accurately _ refers to as ``the best baseball fans
in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   In a World Series-type spotlight only partially shared by the
Cubs' Sammy Sosa, before more than 700 media members who themselves
desperately wanted him to give them The Story, and with the most
immense pressure imaginable, both internal and external, McGwire
delivered. He hit home run No. 60 Saturday off Dennis Reyes. He hit
home run No. 61 Monday off Mike Morgan as a 61st birthday present
for his father. And he hit home run No. 62 Tuesday night off Steve
Trachsel. He then grabbed a microphone and dedicated the home run
to the people of St. Louis. Let some scriptwriter top that.
</P>
<P>
   Again I say that in the matter of Truth vs. Fiction, I always
take Truth and the points. This entire scenario was classic
Hollywood, only a thousand times better. I speak for most of those
aforementioned 700 when I say that in 30 years of professional
sportswriting, this was the most enjoyable non-postseason event I
have covered.
</P>
<P>
   The pursuit of Babe Ruth and Roger Maris would have been
interesting even if _ ugh _ Albert Belle were the challenger. But
the story became Capraesque because all the principals properly
seized the moment and made sure we, and therefore you, knew how
much they appreciated what was going on. The visiting Reds embraced
it. The Cubs, who have their own slugger supreme in Sosa, embraced
it. And the Cardinals, well, they are squeezing every last bit of
enjoyment from it, as well they should.
</P>
<P>
   Check this out:
</P>
<P>
   It is Monday afternoon, and Tony La Russa is standing several
feet away from the cage where the Cubs are taking batting practice.
The Cardinals manager is engaged in conversation, but his eyes keep
darting in the direction of the cage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's Sammy?'' he inquires. ``I thought he was supposed to
be in the second group.''
</P>
<P>
   He resumes the conversation, but only briefly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was supposed to be in the second group. Oh,
well,'' he sighs. ``If he's not going to hit, then I've got to go
back inside.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not Tony La Russa, Mad Baseball Scientist, speaking.
That is Tony La Russa, Baseball Historian and Pure Baseball Fan,
talking. He has just seen his guy put on a colossal BP show, and he
just wants to see if Sosa can match it.
</P>
<P>
   Some three hours later, La Russa is asked why he chose to pitch
to Sosa in the ninth inning of a 3-2 game with a man on third base
and two outs when we all know that in any normal circumstance, he
wouldn't hesitate even a half-second to walk him. ``I never thought
I'd say this,'' La Russa explains, ``but in that situation, those
two guys deserve to be bigger than the game. I yelped the whole
second half of the season about people not pitching to McGwire.''
</P>
<P>
   You know what that is? Honor, that's what. That's a word a
professional sportswriter doesn't often get a chance to throw
around.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another word your generic sportswriter doesn't get to use
very often: joy. The entire five-game Cardinals homestand was all
about celebrating the joy of achievement and the pure joy of
baseball. It is not a knock at any other game to point out a fact
that baseball fans feel is rather obvious _ namely, that no other
game breaks down into such endless and juicy conversational
tidbits. Part of the story is baseball's enviable position as our
most history-laden game. By the time the NFL was founded in 1921,
the National League was in Year 45. Look at a ballpark picture from
the 1890s. It looks like a ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   No other sport has the equivalent of the home run. What are the
possibilities? A long touchdown pass (euphemistically known as a
``home run'' ball, by the way)? A 3-point shot (also known as a
``home run'' ball)? A 50-foot slapper? And no other sport had a
Babe Ruth, and let there be no mistake: The dominant figure in this
whole story was Babe Ruth, because the entire Maris saga revolved
around public reaction to his tampering with the legend and memory
of the Bambino.
</P>
<P>
   To his everlasting credit, McGwire has handled the entire story
with dignity and aplomb. He has made everyone imaginable a part of
the story, from his teammates to his coaches to the trainer to the
equipment man to all Cardinal employees to his 10-year-old son,
Matthew, to the fans and, most touchingly of all, to the widow,
sons, and daughters of Roger Maris, to whom he has shown the utmost
respect and affection.
</P>
<P>
   He is the right man in every way to own this most prestigious of
all American sports records. He looks the part, he acts the part,
and he relishes the part. He's been thanking everyone for
everything, but the fact is that he has performed a valuable public
service by providing this sports- and hero-loving nation with a
needed break from White House scandal, Wall Street horror stories,
and, to parochialize it a bit, Big Dig tales of woe.
</P>
<P>
   So thank you, Mark McGwire. Hope you hit 70.

FOR A TIME, STALLARD A WILLING CONVERSATION PIECE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steve Trachsel is the new Tracy Stallard. The Cubs pitcher
surrendered Mark McGwire's 62d home run in St. Louis Tuesday night
and could use a phone call from the man who yielded No. 61 to Roger
Maris 37 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Stallard, 61, has been fairly quiet in this home run-crazed
summer of 1998. He lives in Virginia, works at construction, and
hasn't been returning phone calls regarding his place in baseball
history (though he did tape a segment for ESPN). He's even asked
family members to keep quiet about the event.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago, Stallard was happy to talk to the Globe about
the day he gave up Maris's record-breaking shot in October 1961.
This is what he said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad he did it off me. Otherwise, I would never have been
thought of again. That was about all I did, and I've had a good
time with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew what was going on back then, but we didn't think that
much about it. It seems like it's bigger now. God, I've been
invited all over the country the last two or three years. It wasn't
like that before. Even that winter after he hit it, nobody ever
said too much about it. All the kids know it now. Kids who weren't
even born.''
</P>
<P>
   Maris's 1961 home run chase of Babe Ruth's seemingly unbreakable
mark of 60, achieved in 1927, went down to the final day of the
season _ Red Sox vs. Yankees at Yankee Stadium. Stallard was a
24-year-old rookie righthander with the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   The 1961 Red Sox were horrible. It was Carl Yastrzemski's rookie
season, and the Pinky Higgins-managed Sox finished 33 behind the
first-place Yankees in the American League. The 1961 Yankees won
109 games, hit 240 homers, beat the Reds in five games to win the
World Series, and made a case for themselves as possibly the best
team ever.
</P>
<P>
   Maris had 60 homers after 159 games, and the Sox came to town to
finish the season. Boston righty Bill Monbouquette blanked Maris in
the Friday game, and Rookie of the Year Don Schwall held Maris
homerless Saturday. The final game was played on a cool Sunday
afternoon, and 23,154 came out to see Stallard (2-6) face Maris and
the rest of the Bronx Bombers (across the Harlem River at the Polo
Grounds, the Boston Patriots played the New York Titans and lost,
37-30). Bill Stafford (13-9) pitched for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Stallard fooled Maris with a changeup in the first inning, and
Maris flied softly to Yaz in left. In the fourth, Stallard fell
behind, 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was throwing a pretty good game,'' remembered Stallard.
``Probably the best game I ever pitched. I threw him a fastball and
he hit it. It wasn't really ripped. I turned and saw Lu Clinton
going back. It was hit pretty high, but I didn't know it was gone
right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Did he groove the pitch?
</P>
<P>
   ``God, no. It was 2-0 and I was just trying to throw a strike. I
don't know how anybody could help anybody hit a home run. Even in
batting practice. I give him all I got. The fastball was probably
all I had. I've met at least 2 million people who tell me they were
there''
</P>
<P>
   Stallard went seven innings, giving up five hits in a 1-0 loss.
He never won another game for the Red Sox. He went 6-17 with the
Mets in 1963 and 10-20 with the Mets in '64. He finished his career
with the Cardinals in 1966, closing with a career record of 30-57.
In 764 2/3 big league innings, he gave up 716 hits, including one
memorable home run.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Stallard played in the Roger Maris memorial charity
golf tournament in Fargo, N.D. He won the tournament and recalled,
with a chuckle, ``Somebody wrote that I finally got even.''

LOOSE CONNECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Summer's end hasn't been as dull as I feared. In the past few
days I've had to contend with a dead iMac, a sluggish Gazelle, and
a Web site so bad that it apparently contributed to the US air
strike against a suspected chemical weapons plant.
</P>
<P>
   The Apple Computer Inc. iMac computer that the Globe purchased
for me was dead on arrival. Actually, the computer itself was fine,
as our techs could see when they plugged it into the Globe's
computer network. Nevertheless, the monitor stayed resolutely
blank.
</P>
<P>
   That was good news for the techs. Like me, they welcome any
excuse to use their screwdrivers. In minutes, the shapely iMac lay
in lovely blue-green pieces. The problem was quickly uncovered: a
loose connector on the machine's video card. But they've ordered me
a new one just to play it safe.
</P>
<P>
   I know it's not necessarily Apple's fault. The cable could have
worked loose during shipment. Don't send me hundreds of e-mails
denouncing me as an enemy of the Macintosh. Last week's tidal wave
was quite enough.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I got many notes of praise for saying nice things
about the iMac. But my critical comments about the iMac's lack of a
floppy disk drive sent some of you into a fury.
</P>
<P>
   Others railed against me for citing ``inaccurate'' speed tests
from CMP Media Inc., which found that Macintosh computers generally
aren't as fast as Apple claims. But now PC Magazine Labs has
benchmarked the iMac. The result: The iMac is fast, but hardly a
barnburner. What do you expect for your $1,300?
</P>
<P>
   That's still more than a lot of consumers can afford, which is
why I had to get my hands on the Gazelle GZW180, by PrecisionTec
LLC of Costa Mesa, Calif. It's a Pentium-class computer at a
startling price _ $399.
</P>
<P>
   You'll pay extra for a monitor, and in other ways as well.
Inferior performance, for instance. The Gazelle comes with Windows
95 rather than Windows 98. Worse yet, it comes with just 16
megabytes of memory. And you can use only 14 megs of that. In the
name of corner-cutting, the Gazelle has its video chip built right
onto the motherboard. But this chip isn't given its own separate
ration of high-speed video memory. Instead, it swipes two megabytes
that would normally be used by the processor. The results:
lower-quality video and slower computing speed.
</P>
<P>
   The Gazelle sports a mere 1.4 gigabyte hard drive; a pair of
tinny, staticky speakers; a flimsy keyboard; and a mouse of
surpassing cheesiness. And yet, the thing works, and it costs a
mere $399. The mind reels _ and so should the minds of Steve Jobs
and his colleagues at Apple. The brutal price wars in the PC
hardware business will continue to drive prices to levels Apple
can't touch. By next year, there'll be really good PCs selling at
Gazelle prices. If the iMac is to stay in the game, it'll have to
get a lot cheaper, and fast.
</P>
<P>
   I'll conclude this week with a warning to designers of World
Wide Web sites: Be careful what you publish on the 'Net _ your life
could depend on it.
</P>
<P>
   Our nation recently launched cruise missiles at a suspected
nerve gas plant in the Sudan, injuring at least 10 people. The
Sudanese government insists the plant, El Shifa Pharmaceuticals,
merely produced medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Our military people first denied this, but have since
backtracked. They still say the plant made chemicals used in nerve
gas, but they admit that El Shifa also made medicine. The plant
even had a contract to supply drugs to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Why didn't our military know this? According to the Los Angeles
Times, US intelligence services relied on a visit to El Shifa's Web
site. The site made no mention of drugs produced at the plant, and,
according to the paper, the intelligence folk took this as more
proof that El Shifa didn't make any. Bombs away.
</P>
<P>
   It creeps me out to imagine generals logging on to Yahoo to
decide who to blast. Still, this may get the attention of corporate
Webmasters, who all too often produce Web sites that lack vital
information like product listings, prices, or phone numbers. If I
flung Tomahawks at all the bad Web sites I've seen, there'd be a
smoldering crater every 20 paces. Good thing I'm not president.

MONITOR DISRUPTIONS WITH WINDOWS 95 COULD CALL FOR VIDEO CARD
CHECKUP
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c.1998 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I have a computer that is about four years old and recently
upgraded it to Windows 95 from 3.1. Now, when the computer comes on
the Windows logo screen looks great, but then as the desktop comes
up, the screen squeezes in to 70 percent of normal horizontal and
goes to about 120 percent of vertical. As a result, the task bar at
the bottom is lost. All efforts to adjust the screen with buttons
and knobs on the monitor have failed. I don't know if it's the
monitor or the graphics hardware or the driver.
</P>
<P>
   A: The video card driver is the first thing you should check,
particularly if you are using the original driver that came on the
Windows 95 disk. Even the most recent, retail version of Windows 95
likely has older drivers than what you'll find on your video card
maker's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   If installing a new driver doesn't help, you might want to see
if the Windows 95 installation didn't recognize your monitor
properly. This will often happen on an older computer that doesn't
fully support Plug-and-Play, particularly if you also have a
monitor that's not Plug-and-Play.
</P>
<P>
   To check the monitor settings, right-click on the open desktop
and choose Properties, then click on the Settings tab. Click the
Advanced button, and from here you should be able to tell what kind
of monitor you have. If it lists a generic monitor, or it's not the
one you have, click on Change. You'll be able to pick from a list
of manufacturers on the left of the dual-pane window, and specific
models on the right. Choose your specific make and model and click
OK.
</P>
<P>
   Your screen may or may not reset at this point. Depending on
your version of Windows 95, you may also have a drop-down box that
will let you change the refresh rate. Once you've chosen your
monitor, one of your choices may be ``Optimal'' _ if so, choose
that.
</P>
<P>
   If that still doesn't fix your problem, you might want to
contact the tech support for the maker of your video card, and then
your monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I currently have 64 megabytes of memory in my computer, and
its maximum is 128 megabytes. Memory is so cheap right now that I
am thinking about taking it to the limit, all the way to 128
megabytes! Will I see a big difference in my performance? Going
from 32 to 64 megabytes was certainly impressive!
</P>
<P>
   A: This depends largely on what kind of user you are.
</P>
<P>
   If you're like most PC users _ with two, maybe three
applications running at a time _ you probably won't see that big an
improvement. You also won't see much improvement if you are using
basic programs _ word processors, browsers or e-mail software.
</P>
<P>
   But if you are a ``power user'' who has many applications up at
the same time, or you use RAM-hungry programs, such as graphics
manipulation packages, then going to 128 megabytes might be a good
idea.
</P>
<P>
   The more memory you can feed Windows, the less it will use the
slower hard drive for virtual memory. But if your needs are modest,
you might not access virtual memory at all with 64 megabytes. In
that case, you can save your money for some other PC goodies.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A lot of people like the changes in the way Windows 98
``moves'' on the screen, where menus slide out or appear to expand
from a single point. But to me, it just seems to make everything
slower. Is there a way to turn these things off so menus just
instantly appear?
</P>
<P>
   A: This is yet another job for TweakUI, the amazing applet
that's found on the Windows 98 CD-ROM (look in the
toolsreskitpowertoy folder; instructions for installing are there,
too).
</P>
<P>
   Launch TweakUI from the Control Panel, then choose the General
tab. You'll see Menu animation, Combo box animation and List box
animation. Uncheck those and watch Windows 98 speed up.

LOW-COST POWER COMES AS A SHOCK
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c.1998 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scanning the newspaper computer ads has turned into an exercise
in reverse sticker shock. Even though it's part of my job to keep
tabs on what's happening with PC prices, I'm always stunned and
amazed at the amount of power $1,000 will buy you today.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few weeks ago, the standard for a sub-$1,000 computer was
a processor that ran in the 233- to 266-megahertz range. Now, with
competition heating up among chip makers, an increasing number of
low-cost computersrun at 300 megahertz or faster.
</P>
<P>
   Predictions that 400-megahertz systems will be selling for
around or below $1,000 by Christmas boggle the mind. But for now,
you'll have to ``settle'' for bargains like these:
</P>
<P>
   _ Aptiva E3N, $999, IBM.Big Blue was a latecomer to the cheap
personal computer party. But IBM has staged a comeback with its E
series of Aptiva PCs.
</P>
<P>
   This Aptiva comes with a 300-megahertz Advanced Micro Devices
K6-2 chip, which has the 3D Now! extensions to help improve 3-D
graphics performance. This isn't automatic, however _ software
developers must write their programs to take advantage of the
chip's features, and AMD is working to convince game companies to
support 3D Now!
</P>
<P>
   The E3N comes with a whopping 64 megabytes of memory, a
six-gigabyte hard drive, a 56K fax modem, an ATI Rage Pro AGP video
card and a 32X CD-ROM drive.
</P>
<P>
   It also has a 100-megahertz system bus, which refers to the
speed at which information travels between the main chip and other
hardware devices. The model I tried, however, was a pre-production
unit and didn't have this feature. Indeed, the E3N felt a bit
sluggish at times; I would have liked to have tried it with the
faster system board.
</P>
<P>
   AMD has been showing off its K6-2's capabilities by creating a
special version of id Software's Quake II that works with 3D Now! I
ran both the K6 and the standard versions, and there was a
noticeable improvement in speed when using the former.
</P>
<P>
   The Aptiva has a couple of interesting programs on it that will
be a boon for novices. An ``Aptiva Adventure'' module configures
Norton Antivirus and some on-screen navigation tools that make it
easier to access the computer's features. A configuration tracker
takes a snapshot of your system when it's healthy, so you can
restore it to working order if something goes awry.
</P>
<P>
   There are two shortcomings to E3N, however. First, it has a
single, shared ISA and PCI expansion slot. That means you can add
just one card to it. Although this would be a nice, affordable game
machine, adding a Voodoo2 add-on 3-D video card means you can't
also add a network card for multiplayer competition. Choose one or
the other, but not both.
</P>
<P>
   Second, if you decide to stick with the ATI video card for your
3-D needs, it's got only two megabytes of video memory, which
limits resolution and color depth capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   _ NEC Ready 9883, $1,099, NEC/Packard Bell. Intel Corp.'s
Celeron processor got a bad rap when it first came out, because
early models lacked a level 2 cache, a kind of buffer that boosts
the speed of data moving into and out of the chip.
</P>
<P>
   But Intel's latest Celerons have this cache feature, and their
performance now rivals that of the more celebrated _ and more
expensive _ Pentium II chips. In fact, some analysts have wondered
why consumers now would even consider a Pentium II system, when the
Celeron-based machines have comparable performance at much lower
costs.
</P>
<P>
   The Ready 9883 uses the 333-megahertz Celeron chip, and it's
easily the peppiest low-cost PC I've tried yet. This machine
handled everything I threw at it flawlessly, despite the fact that
its system bus is only 66 megahertz. I put a Creative Labs 3D
Blaster Voodoo2 card in it, with 12 megabytes of video memory, and
it ran Quake II incredibly smoothly, even at a resolution of
800-by-600 pixels. And it did not require a specially tweaked
version.
</P>
<P>
   It also comes with 64 megabytes of memory; a 6.4-gigabyte hard
drive; a 56K fax modem; and a 32X CD-ROM drive. Like the E3N, it
uses the ATI Rage Pro AGP video card, but this one has four
megabytes of video memory instead of just two. It also is much more
expandable, with two PCI slots and an ISA slot.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Aptiva, the Ready 9883 has an on-screen utility for
working with features and setting preferences. One of those buttons
is an instant connection to the Internet that automatically knows
your preferred onramp. For example, if you have an America Online
account, clicking the Internet Connect button launches the AOL
software.
</P>
<P>
   This computer really is one of the best buys I've seen so far in
the low-price class. Why wait till Christmas?

TIME TO SET THE MILLENNIUM CLOCK  
 SEEKING COMPROMISES ON INTERNET DOMAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (js) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Budd Goldman, an inventor in Mineola, N.Y., has earned his
living for two decades making doo-dads. ``Toilet paper holders that
look like the back of cars, masks over shower heads that looked
like celebrities, a little black box that you pushed it and it
cursed,'' Goldman said, describing a few of his greatest hits.
</P>
<P>
   But now comes, at the end of the 20th century, what Goldman
considers his crowning achievement: the Millennium Clock. ``I've
been practicing to get to this one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The desktop clock is a relentless reminder of the remaining
days, hours, minutes and seconds until the arrival of Jan. 1, 2000
_ as determined by the time zone of the person who sets it.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman said the idea came to him in 1986, as he walked down a
street in Seoul, South Korea. ``There were billboards counting down
to the Olympics,'' he said. ``The idea germinated, and I decided to
make a small version of a countdown clock,'' which would use an LCD
display to count the days until an impending milestone, like a
birthday or an anniversary. But the idea flopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't sell any,'' he said. ``Zippo.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward a decade to 1996, just as millennium fever was
starting to infuse the country. ``I was on the corner of 34th and
Seventh and there was this billboard from a restaurant saying,
`We'll be feeding customers into the new millennium.''' he said.
``The light bulb went off.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman said he has already sold a million millennium clocks,
mostly to department stores and to corporate clients who put their
own logos on the clock's face and give them away as premiums. The
clocks can be ordered through the Countdown Clock International
Inc. Web site (http://www.countdownclock.com) for $24.95 each.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whole emotionality going on, counting down to the
future,'' he said. ``I'm a lucky guy to have been able to give this
to the world _ and to make a couple of bucks.''
</P>
<P>
   Once New Year's Day 2000 arrives, the devices will still have a
function, because they can double at any time as a regular clock.
And Goldman hopes his business, Countdown Clocks International
Inc., will still have a purpose, too. He is about to announce
countdown models for wedding days and pregnancy due dates.

   Seeking Compromises On Internet Domain
</P>
<P>
   With the Clinton administration planning to end federal
financing for the management of Internet domain names on Sept. 30,
the disparate forces struggling to constitute the global network's
first legitimate governing body remain divided on issues trivial
and profound.
</P>
<P>
   As negotiations continue behind the scenes, the Berkman Center
for Internet and Society at Harvard University has canceled a
planned compromise session for next weekend that had been set at
the behest of one coalition that has sponsored a series of
international meetings on the subject this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not convinced it's a productive thing to do,'' said Joe
Sims, a lawyer who is advising Jon Postel, the man who has handled
the administrative end of the Internet's address system for the
last 30 years under the auspices of the federally financed Internet
Assigned Numbers Authority, or IANA.
</P>
<P>
   To replace IANA, Postel has proposed a new administrative body
that would balance the interests of trademark holders, domain name
registrars, national governments and individual Internet users _
and still allow engineers to keep the addresses straight. His
approach has been embraced by the Internet's technical community.
</P>
<P>
   But Network Solutions Inc., the company based in Herndon, Va.,
that currently holds an exclusive contract with the U.S. government
to allocate the most popular domains _ including addresses ending
in ``.com'' _ has declined to sign on. So has the International
Trademark Association.
</P>
<P>
   Among the points of dispute are whether the new group would be
likely to favor adding many more domain names, which trademark
holders oppose, or to impose regulations on registrars _ something
Network Solutions opposes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ira Magaziner, the senior White House adviser on Internet
issues, said he was optimistic that a compromise would be reached
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any negotiation,'' he said, ``if you get things down to two
factions you can lock them in a room and push them to have an
agreement.''

BIG MARKETERS JOIN TO UPGRADE INTERNET ADS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seven top marketers are joining At Home Corp., which operates
the At Home Network Internet service, to create and test the
larger, more elaborate types of online advertising that were the
subject of a meeting last month on interactive marketing sponsored
by Procter &AMP; Gamble Co.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Bratton, advertising director for the At Home Network in
Redwood City, Calif., identified the marketers as AT&AMP;T Corp., the
Bank of America unit of BankAmerica Corp., First USA, Intel Corp.,
Johnson &AMP; Johnson, Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. and Toys ``R'' Us.
</P>
<P>
   The marketers will run ads that use so-called rich media
techniques, which take advantage of the large bandwidth, or network
carrying capacity, of At Home. Such ads are bigger than those now
usually associated with the Internet and can offer animation, sound
and full video.
</P>
<P>
   The test, to be conducted by IPSOS-ASI, a market research
company in Stamford, Conn., and co-sponsored by Intel, will
evaluate the effectiveness of the ads using traditional
measurements like recall, awareness and intent to purchase the
products advertised. Results are to be made available in December.

COMPUTER WHOLESALER IN DEAL WITH TECHNOLOGY SUPPLIER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LAURIE J. FLYNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ingram Micro Inc., the United States' largest wholesale
distributor of computers, has signed a deal with PC Order.com Inc.,
a provider of electronic commerce technology, to create an online
transaction system intended to let Ingram Micro deliver
custom-built computers more efficiently to corporate customers.
</P>
<P>
   For PC Order, a 2-year-old company that plans to go public soon,
the deal will expand its market share to more than three-quarters
of all electronic commerce transactions in the corporate PC sales
market. PC Order, based in Austin, Texas, is already the
transaction-technology supplier to Compaq Computer, Hewlett-Packard
and IBM, among others.
</P>
<P>
   For Ingram, which already had a small online sales operation,
the 5-year deal involves linking the company's PC customers more
directly to Ingram's suppliers and assemblers, which company
executives said should lead to lower costs and faster delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Computer companies have been moving ever faster toward
build-to-order systems, which require quick access to component
data that is possible only through sophisticated electronic
commerce systems like PC Order's, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   PC Order, whose system involves Internet hardware and software
for automating sales transactions and specifying the configuration
of custom-made PCs, also maintains a continuously updated database
on pricing and availability of more than 600,000 computer products
from more than 1,000 manufacturers. It is this information that
Ingram or its subcontractors would use in ordering the components
that go into the PCs.
</P>
<P>
   As part of Tuesday's announcement, Ingram also plans to describe
a new online ordering service, called Prime Access, for companies
that resell machines that Ingram distributes.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, PC Order filed a registration with the Securities and
Exchange Commission to issue up to $35 million in stock. Because PC
Order is in the so-called quiet period that precedes an initial
public offering, neither it nor Ingram would discuss the financial
details of their deal.
</P>
<P>
   PC Order grew out of Trilogy Systems, a business software
company founded in 1989 by Christina Jones, now PC Order's
president.
</P>
<P>
   Ingram Micro, based in Santa Ana, Calif., has evolved from
simply distributing computers to actually manufacturing them on
behalf of Compaq, IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Apple Computer and others.
</P>
<P>
   Ingram's sales were $16.6 billion last year, nearly triple their
1994 level from 1994.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 LOS ANGELES: and attitude.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Derek Baine of the cable industry research firm Paul Kagan
Associates estimates that E! will have revenues of $124 million
this year, with cash flow _ earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and other expenses _ expected to reach $45 million.
Next year, he said, he expects revenues to grow to $144 million and
cash flow to reach $60 million.
</P>
<P>
   Baine, like most analysts, tends to focus on cash flow rather
than net earnings. Cash flow is regarded as a more useful measure
of financial performance of cable channels _ because a channel
often carries a heavy debt load from the start-up costs and because
industry estimates of the acquisition price of a cable channel are
typically based on cash flow projections, not net profits. That
said, though, Baine estimated that 30 percent to 40 percent of E!'s
cash flow was net profit.
</P>
<P>
   By such reckoning, the contrast between the profitability of the
cable channels versus the broadcast networks could not be more
stark. According to Baine, the four principal networks had total
revenues of $12.7 billion last year and cash flow of just $697
million, nearly all of which came from NBC. That generated a cash
flow margin of just 5.5 percent. The cable channels together had
revenues of $9.4 billion and cash flow of $2.5 billion, Baine said.
The cash flow margin of 26 percent, he added, would have been even
higher if the average had not been dragged down by many new, and as
yet unprofitable, cable channels.
</P>
<P>
   E! has achieved success with ratings that by broadcast standards
are less than tiny. The channel tied for 27th place among all cable
channels for the month of July, according to Nielsen Media
Research, with a rating of 0.1 _ about the same level as the
Country Music Channel. That means that only one-tenth of 1 percent
of the roughly 98 million households with televisions were tuned in
to E! in the average minute in July.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Fox, fourth among the broadcast networks, has had
an average rating of 4.9 so far this year, and NBC, the leader, has
had a 9.5 rating. Even E!'s most popular show, ``The Howard Stern
Show,'' rated just 0.3, according to Nielsen.
</P>
<P>
   But in the world of cable, that does not matter much.
</P>
<P>
   ``What E! does well is it's good at packaging,'' said Thomas
Eagan, an analyst at Paine Webber. ``It's all about packaging the
studio movie trailers with other stuff that's already been produced
by somebody else.''
</P>
<P>
   The formula is working so well that E! is going to start its
second channel in October. One of the current channel's successes
has been providing fashion news and helpful fashion hints to
viewers in need of a make-over, largely through a show called
``Fashion Emergency'' _ with segments that have included, for
instance, fashion tips for a woman who had just changed careers
after more than 20 years as a nun.
</P>
<P>
   Masters said the fashion-oriented shows were doing well but that
he was reluctant to take more time away from the core entertainment
news. So E! has developed Style, a channel that will focus entirely
on fashion, design, architecture and the like. The new channel will
be introduced on Oct. 1, taking over the channel formerly occupied
by Q2, a spinoff from the QVC cable shopping network that failed to
develop a following. That will give Style a potential list of 8
million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Masters said he expected the Style channel to reach perhaps 10
million subscribers by the end of the year and to become profitable
in perhaps three years by offering a formula not unlike that on E!
_ keeping things light and upbeat. The new channel will include
original programming, produced in-house with a close eye on the
budget, involving tours of restaurants and homes, plus information
on hair styles, health and beauty, and wine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any pretense about what we're doing,'' Masters
said. ``It's a diversion. That's all we are. It's a fun place to
hang out. It seems to work out for us.''

IN-HOUSE COMPETITION FROM WEB NEWS TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (See also NARROWCAST-TV-MEDIA) 
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The next time Michael Jackson rumors start to swirl, word
spreads of a Hollywood murder-suicide or Matt Damon changes his
hair style, E! Entertainment will probably dispatch not one but two
teams of Hollywood news hounds.
</P>
<P>
   One will come from the cable channel, the other from its sister
Web site, E! Online, and company executives will not mind seeing
the hounds race to get the exclusive. ``They're trying to scoop
each other all the time,'' said Lee Masters, president and chief
executive of E! Entertainment. ``It keeps everybody on their
toes.''
</P>
<P>
   Masters said he did not intend the E! site (www.eonline.com) to
compete with the network so much as to complement it, but he does
intend the online entity to have its own identity. Unlike some
Internet sites that are linked to television programs or even
entire networks, Masters wants E! Online to be something more.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas E! Entertainment has sought to build its television
programming on a shoestring budget, the company has spent more
freely to build up the Web site, Masters said, though he declined
to discuss specific figures. Companies that want to stake a claim
on the Internet need to do so aggressively, and immediately, he
said, and that costs money.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have mouth-watering content and you have to have
an incredibly seductive environment,'' Masters said. ``You have to
stake out that territory now.''
</P>
<P>
   He is less effusive about E! Online's revenue, which he declined
to disclose, though he concedes that like most Internet companies,
it is losing money.
</P>
<P>
   E! went on the Web in August 1996 in a partnership with Cnet, a
new-media company based in San Francisco. The partnership ended a
year later, when E! paid a reported $10 million for Cnet's 50
percent of the venture. At the time, Cnet said it wanted to focus
on its core businesses and E! decided it wanted to own its brand on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Today, 55 full-time E! employees work on the site, 40 of whom
are producing the content _ a daily helping of Hollywood, including
updated news, gossip, Webcasts of movie premieres, and features
like ``Stalkers,'' a three-part article on fans who stalk
celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, not all the Hollywood scoops are exactly the stuff
of the Lehrer Newshour. ``We identified that Matt Damon was hot
back in 1996,'' one staffer said, touting the site's
accomplishments. ``We broke the fact that Blues Traveler was
leaving the Horde Festival.''
</P>
<P>
   The site appears to be getting heavy traffic, with roughly 2
million visitors a month, according to (AT)plan, a Gallup
Organization unit that tracks online traffic.
</P>
<P>
   And a June 1998 survey by Relevant Knowledge Inc. ranked E!
Online as the 23rd most heavily trafficked news and entertainment
site overall, placing it above ABC.com and MTV.com, and ahead of
its direct competitors, which include Entertainment Weekly
(www.pathfinder.com/ew), News Corp.'s TVgen.com site, and
Entertainment Asylum (www.asylum.com).
</P>
<P>
   E! Online is also one of the anchor entertainment tenants on
America Online and offers entertainment programming for broadband
Internet services that provide access and content over television
cable lines, including At Home Network.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mark Mooradian, a group director at the Internet research firm
Jupiter Communications, said one of E! Online's strengths was its
ability to complement the E! Entertainment cable channel.
</P>
<P>
   E! Entertainment cites figures from (AT)plan indicating that
nearly two-thirds of the visitors to its Web site also watch its TV
programs. That gives Masters confidence in his long-term plan to
make E! a player in the industry's oft-predicted convergence of
television and cyberspace. ``We want to get our grubby little paws
on every aspect of this business that we can,'' he said.

E! ENTERTAINMENT: A WASTELAND, AND PROUD OF IT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As a new television season approaches, the
broadcast networks are winding up an annual rite that involves
spending hundreds of millions of dollars developing new series in
hopes of finding the next ``Seinfeld'' or ``ER.'' Though the
chances of success are minuscule, the networks persist because the
only way of attracting big audiences, and profits, is to come up
with an original hit.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect to see this sort of exercise on the niche cable
channels, like E! Entertainment, which often succeed by spending
far more modest sums and attracting relatively small but loyal
audiences _ even if the viewers watch for only a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The proliferation of niche channels in recent years has turned
the old economic model for success on its head. Broadcast networks
battle to attract big audiences with hugely expensive programming _
such as the $13 million an episode NBC is paying for ``ER'' and the
billions of dollars networks like CBS and ABC are paying for the
rights to broadcast football games. But so-called narrowcast cable
channels have been building highly profitable businesses by
thinking small and keeping programming budgets tight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe money sometimes gets in the way of creativity,'' Lee
Masters, E!'s president, said in an interview in his modest office
in the nondescript office block the company occupies here.
</P>
<P>
   E!, which mixes upbeat coverage of the entertainment and fashion
worlds with reruns of old broadcast series, is one of the more
telling examples of cable channels that have succeeded with few if
any truly original programming ideas or major hit shows. Other
niche channels _ whether the History Channel or the Sci-Fi Channel,
the Nashville Network or Black Entertainment Television _ have
built followings by focusing on narrow audiences. But E! stands
out, analysts say, in part because it is meta-entertainment _
entertainment about entertainment _ and in part because it has
prospered by keeping costs so low.
</P>
<P>
   The channel largely repackages others' programming and offers
everything about movies except opinions on what's good and what's
not.
</P>
<P>
   And E! wears a figurative smirk much of the time. Consider the
way John Henson, the irreverent host of ``Talk Soup,'' a late-night
compilation of clips from the day's talk shows, opened the program
on a recent evening: ``So you're a sick little freak who enjoys
talk-show highlights, eh? Good. I'm John Henson. Welcome back.''
</P>
<P>
   That is just the way Masters likes it. ``We're one step above
mindless, and proud of it,'' he said. ``We're not solving the
riddle of the Sphinx here.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the programming is designed for people who, by the
channel's own admission, are likely to surf in for a few minutes
then surf on. Such viewership is generally good enough for the
cable systems that agree to include E! in their basic cable
packages, giving the channel access to 51 million of the 76.8
million households that have access to E!.
</P>
<P>
   It is also an audience that generally suffices for E!, which
operates on a different financial basis from the networks. Unlike
broadcast networks, which rely solely on advertising for their
revenues, so-called basic cable channels like E! have two revenue
sources _ advertising and subscription fees.
</P>
<P>
   That means the networks are engaged in a relentless race not
just to generate the maximum number of viewers for each show but to
have as many of those viewers as possible fall within the desirable
18-to-49 age group that advertisers pay a premium to reach. Cable
companies, of course, do try to reach as large an audience as
feasible to generate the best advertising revenues. But with most
cable channels enjoying a continually growing base of subscribers,
the channels can prosper so long as people watch even a small
portion of the time _ assuming they pay their monthly bills.
Analysts estimate that E! receives on average about 9 cents to 10
cents a month for each of its 51 million subscribers (a figure
expected to grow to 54 million by year-end).
</P>
<P>
   E!, which is owned by a group of media companies, does not
release any financial figures, but Masters said the network
received about 50 percent of its overall revenues from advertising
and about 40 percent from subscription fees. The remaining 10
percent comes from E!'s international distribution in Asia, Latin
America and Europe, which Masters said could become one of the
fastest-growing portions of E!'s business.
</P>
<P>
   Started eight years ago by a group of cable companies, E! is
currently owned about 39 percent by Walt Disney Co., which also
owns ABC, and 40 percent by Comcast Communications Corp., which
manages E! The remaining 21 percent of E! is evenly split between
Media One and Tele-Communications Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The channel has seen its overall value rise from a few million
dollars to roughly $800 million, according to analysts, based on a
rough calculation that a cable channel is worth between $15 and $20
for each subscriber. And it has achieved this mainly by running
movie trailers (provided free by the studios), covering
star-studded movie premieres and repackaging other programs. For
example, at 11 p.m. and 2 a.m. each day, E! telecasts a taping of
Howard Stern as he broadcasts his radio show.
</P>
<P>
   And E! stands clear of the ferocious competition that exists
between the two broadcast programs that focus on the entertainment
industry: ``Access Hollywood'' and ``Entertainment Tonight.'' Those
two shows, which run for a half-hour each week night, fight
bitterly over matters like which will get a film preview first or a
particular celebrity interview. E!, with its 24-hour format, is
generally content to succeed with volume and attitude.

WITNESS LISTS SUGGEST STRATEGIES OF MICROSOFT, U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the filing of witness lists on Friday night, the government
and Microsoft Corp. offered the first glimpse of their courtroom
strategies in the historic antitrust trial scheduled to begin later
this month.
</P>
<P>
   The government will portray Microsoft as an information-age
monopolist with anticompetitive practices that are wide-ranging and
that began long before anyone heard of the Internet. Microsoft
plans to mount its defense by putting eight top executives on the
stand, but with one conspicuous absence _ Bill Gates, Microsoft
chairman, who is not on the witness list.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-person witness list for the Justice Department and 20
states suing Microsoft suggests a broadening of the evidence it
intends to marshal to make its case. Its industry witnesses include
executives from Intel Corp., IBM and Boeing Co., all of whom are
expected to offer evidence of what the plaintiffs say are Microsoft
tactics that unfairly curb competition. None were mentioned in the
complaint filed in May by the government and states.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this witness list, the government is trying to point to a
broader pattern of anticompetitive behavior over many years and to
put that long history in the record,'' said Robert Litan, a former
senior Justice Department official who is now at the Brookings
Institution. ``This is an effort to lift the court's nose out of
the details and look at the broader picture.''
</P>
<P>
   To help fill out that broader picture, the government will call
John Soyring, vice president of personal software products at IBM.
His history with Microsoft goes back nearly a decade, when he was a
manager on IBM's OS/2 operating system.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the two companies were ostensibly partners in the
operating system market with an early plan calling for Microsoft's
Windows being developed as a basic system and IBM's OS/2 evolving
into a high-performance operating system. The partnership broke up,
the two companies became rivals and Microsoft prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   Another industry witness for the government is Steve McGeady, an
Intel vice president. He was present at meetings in 1995 when Gates
reportedly pressed Intel to curb its development of multimedia and
Internet software, and to limit its support for Netscape
Communications Corp., the early front-runner and Microsoft's main
rival in the market for software used to browse the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   To further broaden its evidence, the government wants to show
the court that Microsoft can pressure big companies not to purchase
software from its rivals. To provide the perspective of a big
corporate customer, the government plans to call Boeing executive
Scott Vesey.
</P>
<P>
   The other industry witnesses for the government and states
include James Barksdale, the president of Netscape, whose battle
with Microsoft in the browser market is the central focus of the
antitrust case; David Colburn, a senior vice president of America
Online Inc., and William Harris, president of Intuit Inc., the
personal finance software maker. In the America Online and Intuit
cases, the government contends that Microsoft unfairly used its
market muscle to get both companies to choose Microsoft's browser
over the Netscape offering.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department official characterized his side's witness
list as a ``Who's Who of America's technology leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Microsoft view is that the government and states'
witnesses are a ``sign that they are running away from their
original case,'' said Mark Murray, a company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   A central accusation in the case filed in May, Murray noted, was
that Microsoft's licensing contracts with personal computer makers
were anticompetitive. The contracts, the government said, limited
personal computer makers in purchasing software from rival software
companies and denied them the freedom to select what Internet
services were featured on the desktop screens of the machines they
sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the government did not call a single PC maker as a
witness,'' Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   One witness on the government's list works for a major PC maker,
IBM, but the IBM executive is expected to testify mainly about
Microsoft's tactics in the software business.
</P>
<P>
   An industry witness for Microsoft is an executive for a major
personal computer maker, John Rose, a senior vice president for
Compaq Computer Corp., who is expected to testify that his
company's contracts with Microsoft do not hinder its business.
</P>
<P>
   Absent from the Microsoft witness list is Gates, known as a
brilliant and energetic executive who is involved in every
important decision made at the company. Gates was omitted from the
witness list, Murray said, because the eight executives included
were those on the ``front lines of each of the issues raised in the
government's case; Bill Gates was not as directly involved in these
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Justice Department and states contend that Gates is the
central figure in Microsoft's strategy in the Internet software
market, and his memos and e-mail correspondence are a key part of
the evidence in the case.
</P>
<P>
   One person who was at the recent videotaped deposition of Gates
said that Microsoft's lawyers might have determined that putting
him on the stand could hurt them more than it helped. ``He's so
argumentative and contentious,'' this person said, ``that Gates
kind of took himself out of contention.''
</P>
<P>
   During the deposition, Gates not only professed to many memory
lapses but, this person said, disputed seemingly innocuous facts
like definitions of computing terms that appeared in Microsoft's
own documents. Gates, this person said, also professed not to know
the level of Microsoft's sales and profits and not to know the
share of the operating system market held by Microsoft's Windows.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to industry witnesses, both sides will call economic
and technical experts. On the government side, the technology
experts include David Farber, a University of Pennsylvania computer
scientist and an Internet pioneer; Edward Felton, a computer
scientist at Princeton University, and Glenn Weadock, president of
Independent Software Inc. Its economic experts include Franklin
Fisher, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist who was a
witness for IBM in its antitrust confrontation with the government;
David Sibley, a University of Texas economist, and Frederick
Warren-Bolton, a former chief economist of the Justice Department's
antitrust division.
</P>
<P>
   For Microsoft, its economic witness will be Richard Schmalensee,
an MIT economist, and its technical expert will be Michael
Dertouzos, director of IT's computer science laboratory.

PATENTS: BOARD GAMES FOR FUN OR EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Labor Day is generally a celebration of time off from work and
school. Millions of people will spend the day in back yards, beside
pools, or at beaches and camp sites. Many of those will pass the
time with games _ sports, cards and board games _ without realizing
that they are playing with patented inventions.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, hundreds of ball games, computer games, board games,
card games, arcade games and athletic games win patents each year.
Some are variations on games like poker or blackjack; others are
electronic, miniature or portable versions of traditional games
like basketball or football, and still others are creative hybrids
like golf-pool tables.
</P>
<P>
   Board games generally depend on players rolling dice to move
game pieces around a specific course, but the objectives of newly
patented games are often surprising.
</P>
<P>
   Up to six people could while away Labor Day playing Laurence
Brown's political board game. Players are randomly assigned a role
_ either as elected politicians or as members of a particular
constituency.
</P>
<P>
   Each turn begins with the roll of three differently colored
dice. A card is then drawn from a set that raises political
questions on which the players vote. The cards are divided into
public-interest fields like domestic and international affairs,
taxes, crime or the federal debt.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the cards raise constitutional or ethical dilemmas.
Players can be ejected from the game if they are impeached for
unethical behavior or conflict-of-interest voting, or because their
votes violate the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who lives in Springfield, Va., says in his patent that
the object of the game is ``to direct voter attention to the
perspective of issues from various points of view and public
interest and to hone voting judgment and skill.'' He received
patent 5,769,715.
</P>
<P>
   Mathematics may not sound like a subject for an enjoyable board
game, but Patrick Thompson believes people can sharpen their math
skills with his game. Thompson, from Joplin, Mo., designed a board
divided into several pie-shaped wedges. Within each wedge are small
boxes bearing the numbers 1 through 15, and there is a set of cards
with instructions to add, subtract, divide or multiply.
</P>
<P>
   Each player is assigned a section of the game board, draws a
card and then rolls one, two or three dice. The player has up to 60
seconds to follow the instructions on the card he drew to calculate
a solution using the numbers on the dice to arrive at a figure that
appears on his part of the board. The object is to cover that
number with a chip and keep playing until all the numbers in the
section are covered.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson says that if a player ``rolls 4, 5 and 6, and draws the
add card, he could add all three to get 15,'' and then cover the
number 15 on the board. The player loses a turn if the calculation
is not done within the time limit. Players can challenge one
another's calculations, and remove an opponent's chips if the
challenge is successful. Thompson received patent 5,772,209.
</P>

<P>
   Since Labor Day often includes picnics and barbecues, Ruth Bard
Pierce's new board game might be enjoyed more on another day. The
game is called ``Fat Chance,'' the objective is ``winner loses
all,'' and play revolves around losing as much weight as possible.
Players are issued tokens that represent pounds of excess weight,
and a predetermined amount they have to lose to win the game.
</P>
<P>
   The game board is laced with routes that players can choose to
follow _ one is called Healthy Lifestyle, another is Crash Diet and
a third is named Excuses. Players roll dice and move game pieces
along the route they have selected. Each space along the path
indicates how much weight the player loses or gains within each
turn.
</P>
<P>
   Players who choose the Healthy Lifestyle path lose weight more
slowly than those on the Crash Diet, but crash dieters gain back
more. Along the way, players can land on question-and-answer
spaces, which require them to draw a card and answer a question.
Correct answers mean more pounds lost. The winner is the first
player to lose all of his or her weight. Ms. Pierce, who lives in
Annandale, N.J., received patent 5,704,611.
</P>
<P>
   For teen-agers preparing for their first driver's license test,
Gilberto Lopez has created a game that uses tokens, dice and cards
to reinforce the rules of the road. Lopez, who lives in San Juan,
Puerto Rico, designed a board with playing spaces that look like
roads, traffic signals and traffic hazards.
</P>
<P>
   Players roll the dice, move around the board and earn points by
memorizing and obeying safety rules, signs and speed limits. Cards
drawn on certain spaces raise questions just like those ``on the
written driver's license examination,'' Lopez says in his patent.
He won patent 5,749,580.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Schmid's patent doesn't cover a game, but rather
clothing with a game-board design and detachable playing pieces.
Ms. Schmid, who lives in Shelby Township, Minn., came up with the
idea of clothing bearing game-board patterns across the front or
back, and a series of hook-and-loop, or Velcro, fasteners.
</P>
<P>
   Game pieces like dice, tokens, chips, or player icons attach to
the garment at the fastener spots. To play the game represented on
the clothing, the garment is taken off and laid flat. Players then
pull the game pieces off and they're ready to go. Ms. Schmid holds
patent 5,734,991.
</P>
<P>
   Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and
Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

SOFTWARE MAKERS WIN A ROUND IN YEAR 2000 COURT FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In one of the first battles in what promises to be a long and
titanic legal struggle over year 2000 computer woes, the maker of
the popular financial software Quicken has scored a knockdown. But
ultimate victory for the company is far from certain in a lawsuit
that tests just how active software companies must be in heading
off problems their customers might suffer as a result of the
so-called millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
   The online banking package in several older versions of Quicken,
which is made by Intuit Inc. of Cupertino, Calif., flashes an
``error'' message when called on to deal with dates on or after
Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 problem, popularly known as Y2K, is a result of
software in which programmers saved memory by using only the final
two digits of a year, so that computers interpret ``00'' and ``01''
as the years 1900 and 1901.
</P>
<P>
   When the lawsuit was filed late last year on behalf of hundreds
of thousands of Quicken users, Intuit became one of the first
targets of class action litigation asserting liability for year
2000 problems.
</P>
<P>
   A California judge's recent decision to dismiss the lawsuit in
its current form gave Intuit, and perhaps other software companies,
some breathing room to work out strategies intended to minimize
their liabilities from year 2000 problems. The dismissal was mainly
based on the reasoning that no demonstrable damages had yet
occurred to the plaintiffs because the program had not yet failed
as a result of the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed in Santa Clara County, Calif., where
Intuit is based, in the name of Alan Issokson and other Quicken
users. The plaintiffs are represented by Milberg Weiss Bershad
Hynes &AMP; Lerach, a law firm widely feared by businesses for its
success with class actions.
</P>
<P>
   Milberg Weiss also has Y2K class actions pending against four
other producers of business and consumer software: Software
Business Technologies Inc., Symantec Corp., Macola Inc. and Real
World Corp..
</P>
<P>
   The Issokson suit contended that Intuit was unfairly forcing
consumers who wanted to avoid banking problems resulting from year
2000 defects to pay anywhere from $20 to $40 to upgrade to Quicken
98, which is not prone to the problem. Five other law firms soon
filed copycat class actions _ two in California and three in New
York.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Intuit did not dispute that the early versions of Quicken have
year 2000 blind spots, but it argued that the program's defects _
such as an inability to schedule a full year's worth of bill
payments after Jan. 1, 1999 _ were not yet apparent to users.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Allison Hubbard Colgin, the company's senior counsel,
said that although there had been no public announcement before
Milberg Weiss filed its suit, Intuit had been working ``for
months'' on plans to offer free upgrades so that no one would be
damaged in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The Aug. 27 ruling by Superior Court Judge John Herlihy, which
Intuit announced last week, was a legalistic version of the old
playground basketball rule: no blood, no foul. He also pointed out
that Milberg Weiss had not said that Issokson had actually sought
and been denied a remedy to the supposed defects. Milberg Weiss was
given the opportunity to reword the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Spencer, a Milberg Weiss partner in New York, conceded
that it might be difficult to resurrect the lawsuit in a form that
Herlihy would accept. He and Intuit's lawyers agreed that motions
to quash the other Intuit suits would probably succeed if other
judges followed Herlihy's logic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no material difference in the suits,'' Mrs. Colgin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawsuits against other software vendors differ in that they
include charges that some damage has already occurred. Spencer said
that forcing all computer users to suffer damages before they are
allowed to sue would delay remedies and add to the overall cost of
the year 2000 problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's counterproductive,'' he said.

 MENLO PARK, Calif.: everything technical.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clark has been an avid sailor since one of his Silicon Graphics
colleagues introduced him to the sport in 1986. In 1996, he helped
raise money for the San Francisco-based St. Francis Yacht Club's
backing of America One, a hopeful for the America's Cup challenge
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Sailing is an enthusiasm shared by other members of the Silicon
Valley technocracy, including Tom Perkins and John Doerr, partners
in the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, and
Larry Ellison, chairman of the database software giant Oracle. In
June, Ellison's 78-foot maxi-racer, the Sayonara, won the ILC Maxi
World Championship, beating Morning Glory, a yacht owned by Hasso
Plattner, co-founder and chief executive of Oracle's rival SAP AG.
</P>
<P>
   Yet none of the Valley's other yachtsmen have been as personally
involved in creating their sailing vessels as Clark.
</P>
<P>
   His inspiration for Hyperion came in the summer of 1995, as
Netscape's phenomenally successful initial public offering was
making headlines, when Clark happened to see a ship called Juliet,
built by the Royal Huisman Shipyard, whose exquisite craftsmanship
caught his eye.
</P>
<P>
   Clark hired the ship designer German Frers to do Hyperion, with
another highly regarded designer, Pieter Beeldsnijder, to do the
interior styling. ``The craftsmanship is impeccable,'' Clark said.
Because of his schedule, Clark does not plan to be on board when
Hyperion leaves Amsterdam on its maiden voyage, though he may join
it when it stops in the Canary Islands en route to St. Barthelemy.
</P>
<P>
   Though the later itinerary is still to be arranged, eventually
the ship is to reach San Francisco, where the Hyperion's 194-foot
carbon-fiber mast _ the world's tallest, the Huisman shipbuilders
say _ will clear the Golden Gate Bridge by a mere 30 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Though Clark does not intend to be aboard Hyperion for its
entire voyage, he will not need to be. Through a satellite link,
the ship is designed to enable him to monitor operations.
</P>
<P>
   He would even be able _ although he says he never intends to
usurp his crew by doing so _ to remotely take Hyperion's helm via
computer terminal from his Seascape office in Menlo Park, his
part-time residence in Atherton, Calif., his permanent home in Palm
Beach, Fla., or virtually anywhere else in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Early in 2000, Clark plans to be aboard to sail the ship to
Auckland, New Zealand, to watch the America's Cup race. And when
might he plan to formally launch Seascape as his fourth company?
</P>
<P>
   Between preparing for Healtheon's initial public offering and
Hyperion's first voyage, Clark said he had scant free time to chart
the start-up's future. He does plan to keep Seascape's engineers
employed for at least a year after Hyperion sets sail, initially to
debug the system and then to explore the potential for
commercializing the software.
</P>
<P>
   He said he doubted that Seascape would pursue the obvious niche
for Hyperion's system, the yachting industry, because he sees the
market as too narrow. More likely, he said, the software would be
marketed to complex environments like petroleum-processing plants,
where many sophisticated operations must be monitored over a wide
area.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing that is virtually certain for Clark, who
calls himself a ``half-entrepreneur, half-venture capitalist,'' is
that something more than a fancy sailboat lies over the horizon.
``I don't like spending this much time and energy on just a
hobby,'' he said.

<P>
   MENLO PARK, Calif. _ When people on Wall Street think these days
about the entrepreneur Jim Clark _ founder of Silicon Graphics in
1982 and co-founder of Netscape Communications in 1994 _ their
thoughts most likely involve his third start-up, Healtheon Corp.
That is because Healtheon, an online service for the health-care
industry, is planning a widely anticipated public offering in late
September.
</P>
<P>
   But Clark, chairman of Healtheon and a major investor in it,
seems nearly as intent on a separate autumn launching, set for
mid-November. That is when the 155-foot sailboat Hyperion, a highly
computerized vessel that Clark began planning in 1995, is to start
its maiden voyage from a port in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, to the
Caribbean island of St. Barthelemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been working harder on this project than I have any time
since the beginning of Netscape,'' Clark, a 54-year-old,
6-foot-4-inch lanky blond, said in a recent interview in a modest
office here in a dissonant setting: above a Jenny Craig Weight Loss
Center, enveloped in the fast-food aromas of a nearby Arby's
roast-beef restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Though work on the Hyperion has involved long hours lately and
frequent trips to the Netherlands by chartered jet, Clark shows no
signs of travel fatigue as he speaks excitedly about the yacht,
which outside experts estimate is costing him $30 million to build.
(He declined to discuss such matters.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an RV _ a luxurious RV,'' Clark said. ``A self-contained,
extremely sophisticated vehicle made for a harsh environment. And
it has the most complex nonindustrial automation system that's ever
been built.''
</P>
<P>
   If this last superlative sounds like a sales pitch, someday it
just might be. More than the expensive hobby of a man with an
estimated net worth of $600 million, the Hyperion has begotten yet
another Clark start-up _ Seascape Communications, a venture in
which he and three former Silicon Graphics engineers have been
developing the technological guts of the sailboat. Someday, Clark
said, some of their work may find its way into marketable products.
</P>
<P>
   Because no commercial system existed for the completely
computerized operating and navigational system that Clark had
envisioned for Hyperion, he decided to create his own. ``I had a
particular idea in mind,'' Clark said. ``I wrote 20 percent of the
Hyperion's software code. I built an underlying set of tools, and
the engineers used that as a nucleus.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is an aluminum-hulled vessel housing 20 powerful
Silicon Graphics computers, 37 miles of network cables and 500
billion bytes of storage for an electronic log that will
automatically record everything that happens with the ship, from
changing the oil to hoisting sails totaling 13,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim is shooting over the horizon and our objective is to meet
him on the horizon,'' said Jan Bokxem, who as technical project
manager is overseeing the installation of the ship's computer
systems at the 114-year-old Royal Huisman Shipyard in the
Netherlands. ``The industry isn't ready yet for some of what he's
requesting. Everything on Hyperion needs to be controlled and
interfaced to computers.''
</P>
<P>
   The ship's data and control systems are automated on a central
server computer, where all monitoring data is formatted and entered
into a database that becomes part of the ship's memory.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is for this database to help teach the ship, its
captain and crew to sail better, using past experience to determine
optimal sail settings for specific wind conditions, for example.
(Not that Clark is expecting Hyperion's captain, Alan Prior, who
has been a crew member in the America's Cup and Whitbread races, to
require much tutoring.)
</P>
<P>
   Each of the touch-screen computer terminals throughout Hyperion
will offer passengers amenities like activating towel heaters in
bathrooms, selecting wine from the cellar, or choosing a CD from
the 700-plus titles in a music library with selections from
Beethoven to U2.
</P>
<P>
   But most noteworthy may be Hyperion's bridge _ the control deck,
which on most yachts is where the various gauges and monitoring
instruments are arrayed. On many modern ships, these devices tend
to be a hodgepodge of systems from various vendors, with readouts
that are difficult to consolidate to provide a single look at
overall operations.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Hyperion's streamlined bridge has six
20-inch-diagonal computer screens displaying virtual instruments
designed to look like conventional ones and using software that can
automate all of these monitoring functions and integrate them into
a single operational system.
</P>
<P>
   This approach makes it possible for the captain on the bridge,
the owner from a remote location and the crew members from various
positions on the ship to have access to the information and to give
commands _ assuming they have personal-identification numbers that
authorize them to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though Hyperion's system is sophisticated and complex,
it's simple in terms of what the user sees,'' Clark said.
``Simplicity is the cornerstone of everything technical.''

DOW SLIDE MAY RENEW SOME VISION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAVID HOYE   
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Are you a person with vision?
</P>
<P>
   If so, you have my sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   It's nearly impossible these days to have vision, or to think
long term. Nobody's interested. The whole world wants results, and
they want them now, thank you very much.
</P>
<P>
   We live in a world of five-minute doctor visits, drive-through
restaurants and instant gratification. ``Long-term planning'' in
most companies means next week, not next year.
</P>
<P>
   So it has been rather interesting to watch the craziness
surrounding Internet start-up companies. Now here's an industry
where ``long term'' is everything.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody's making money yet, except, perhaps, Yahoo!. Yet
investors have flocked to such companies, flooding them with cash
on the expectation that there's money to be made down the road, as
millions of consumers begin using the new online medium.
</P>
<P>
   There is money to be made. But it ain't happening yet.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet Stock Index, for example, tracks about 50 top
Internet-related stocks. Two-thirds of the companies on the list
operate in the red or just break even.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Wolff's new book, ``Burn Rate,'' details the absurdity
of it all, beginning with the title. ``Burn Rate,'' the former
journalist and entrepreneur points out, refers to the amount of
money a promising start-up company consumes each month in excess of
its income.
</P>
<P>
   It's all so bizarre that even the comic strip ``Doonesbury'' has
gotten into the act, making fun of Internet companies that operate
in the red, yet keep attracting millions of dollars in investment
capital.
</P>
<P>
   But is the tide turning?
</P>
<P>
   The Aug. 31 market crash hit technology stocks hard.
Internet-related stocks took the brunt of it. Stock in Amazon.com,
a hugely successful online book seller, lost 21 percent of its
value Monday, and 4.5 percent more on Sept. 1. Yahoo! sank 17
percent Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Such stocks may have made up their losses by the time you read
this, but many in the industry are wondering whether the honeymoon
is over. Could it be that investors have turned a corner, and from
now on will require a bit more in return for their cash?
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't surprise me. After all, investing in the future
requires vision. &QL; 
Seniors page debuts
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo! has produced another one of its trademark specialty
areas. This time, the special area is devoted to senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   It's called Yahoo! Senior's Guide, seniors.yahoo.com. (Note:
There is no ``www'' at the beginning of that Web address.)
</P>
<P>
   The site takes all the Web has to offer and filters it, leaving
only those resources that might be interesting to older Americans.
</P>
<P>
   There are familiar categories _ computers, entertainment,
travel, etc. . . . But when you click on them, you're treated to a
group of Web sites and other resources that apply to seniors.
</P>
<P>
   Click on Computers, for example, and you get subcategories
including links to other Web sites for seniors and links to topics
of interest to seniors, such as genealogy.
</P>
<P>
   There also are links to senior-oriented live chats and a host of
message boards on topics ranging from health care to personal
finance.
</P>
<P>
   Now, something funny
</P>
<P>
   Owen Whetzel, a fine gentleman I once worked with in California,
keeps in occasional touch with me via e-mail. And I appreciate
that, too, as he often forwards humorous postings he runs across in
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   His latest electronic dispatch began:
</P>
<P>
   ``If lawyers can be disbarred, and clergymen defrocked, doesn't
it follow that . . .
</P>
<P>
   - Electricians can be delighted.
</P>
<P>
   - Cowboys can be deranged
</P>
<P>
   - Models can be deposed
</P>
<P>
   - Organ donors can be delivered
</P>
<P>
   - Musicians can be denoted.
</P>
<P>
   - Bedmakers can be debunked.
</P>
<P>
   Hmm. I guess so. Thanks for pointing that out, Owen! &QL;

A NEW TWIST ON AIRMAIL FOR UNPLUGGED TRAVELERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (The Science Times)  
 By ROB FIXMER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a few short years, e-mail has become the pulse of the
workplace and a tool that is often most missed when an Internet
connection is unavailable. A wireless e-mail service answers that
need by enabling business travelers to send and receive electronic
messages almost anywhere in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   PageNet, a leading paging company, last month introduced its
Two-Way service built around the PageWriter 2000, a palm-size
6.7-ounce device made by Motorola that opens like a clam to reveal
a tiny screen in the upper shell and a keyboard below.
</P>
<P>
   The PageWriter has no external antenna, no modem and no
telephone jack, yet it sends and receives e-mail almost instantly,
and it does so from deep within steel-and-concrete buildings where
cellular phones cannot receive a signal.
</P>
<P>
   No one is going to write a doctoral dissertation using this
Lilliputian device, but it does offer a remarkable set of features
and a lot of processing power, considering its size. In addition to
sending and receiving Internet e-mail, it includes an address book
that can be used independently to store telephone numbers,
addresses and personal identification numbers for other pagers that
are capable of receiving text messages. It can also send faxes and
is designed to be upgraded with more storage capacity and extra
programs, including a calendar application and games.
</P>
<P>
   The basic model comes with one megabyte of flash memory, which
is a type of memory that is used instead of a disk drive, and 256
kilobytes of RAM for a total of 1.25 megabytes, about one-eighth
the memory of a typical palm computer but still enough to store
dozens of messages and several hundred address-book entries.
</P>
<P>
   It comes with a docking station that doubles as a battery
charger and connects the PageWriter to a standard computer to
transfer data between the two machines. That feature could not be
tested for this review because, as of last week, the software for
the personal computer end of the connection was not yet available.
</P>
<P>
   The NimH (nickle metal hydride) battery is rated to last for
seven days of standby, that is, waiting to receive a message. After
its first charge, the model tested for this review went dead at the
end of three days. But performance improved with each charging;
after the fourth, it lasted about five days, during which it was
left on continuously and was used to send and receive several dozen
messages a day.
</P>
<P>
   The PageWriter uses Motorola's own operating system, called
Flex, which cannot run programs written for other handheld devices.
Still, the overall design is well-conceived and easily learned.
</P>
<P>
   A single home button always returns the user to the PageWriter's
main menu of functions. The interface is point-and-click, although
in place of a mouse, the device uses a pancake-shaped button called
a ``NavDisc'' that moves the cursor, joystick-like, around the
screen. The tab key jumps the cursor from function to function and
can be used to cycle quickly through menus. With a little practice,
navigation becomes second nature.
</P>
<P>
   The ultra-tiny keyboard _ about 3.5 inches by 2 inches _ is very
difficult to get used to. But a user eventually discovers that the
secret is to avoid the natural inclination to push the keys with
the index finger of the right hand while holding the PageWriter
with the left. It is much more efficient, and surprisingly more
comfortable, to punch out messages with two thumbs while holding
the device with both hands.
</P>
<P>
   By necessity, the keyboard has the standard arrangement for
letters but almost everything else is non-standard. Yet, the
functions are logically designed. For example, with so little room,
it would take the dexterity and small motor skills of a surgeon to
hold the shift key while simultaneously depressing any other key.
So the shift key has been designed to produce the uppercase
character of the first key depressed subsequently.
</P>
<P>
   Another useful feature for e-mailing on the go, and a bit of
compensation for the keyboard, is a list of 16 stock responses that
pops up whenever the user replies to a received message. These
range from simple ``yes'' and ``no'' to ``Can this wait?'' and ``On
my way.'' The user can add custom responses to the list.
</P>
<P>
   For safety reasons, the PageWriter can be turned off completely
when boarding aircraft (required by federal law) and can be set to
receive-only mode for hospitals, clinics and other environments in
which radio transmissions interfere with sensitive equipment.
</P>
<P>
   When the PageWriter is turned off or is unable to receive
signals, the PageNet system stores incoming messages, then delivers
them as soon as the pager is turned back on or as its signal is
restored.
</P>
<P>
   The price for this convenience is relatively high. The
PageWriter 2000 costs about $360, although it can also be leased to
own for $19 a month for two years. The PageNet service plans are
based on the number of characters sent and received. They range
from $24.95 a month, which includes 8,000 characters (a little
longer than this column) plus 12 cents for every character over
that limit, to $129.95, which includes 60,000 characters plus 4
cents per 10 characters. This is more expensive than it seems
because all messages are rounded up to the nearest 10 characters;
thus, sending a simple ``yes'' counts as 10 characters against the
monthly limit.
</P>
<P>
   Because this product is built around paging technology, each
user's e-mail address is his paging number, minus the 800, plus
``pagenet.net.'' This is a convenience in terms of remembering
one's own address but is generally annoying to other people, since
it is typically easier to remember an address built around a
person's name than around a seemingly random seven-digit number.
</P>
<P>
   This is exacerbated by a major drawback to the Flex e-mail
system _ its inability to use any identification other than the
e-mail address of the user in the ``From'' field of the message
header. Thus, instead of getting a message from, say, Fred Klein,
the recipient gets a message from someone identified only as
5551234(AT)pagenet.net.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can the user send a ``Subject'' line, which might be used to
note his or her identity. In a corporation that adopts this system,
employees are going to find themselves staring at inboxes full of
messages from senders identified only as numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that is a relatively minor flaw. Of greater concern is
that on two occasions e-mail sent to the device bounced back to the
sender with a notice that no such e-mail account existed. For all
the convenience this system offers, reliability is far more crucial
to business users, especially at the price of this service.

Internet the latest frontier where candidates reach voters 
By Charles Walston  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Used to be in Georgia politics, a stump speech from
the back of a flatbed truck was the preferred way to reach voters.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, candidates rely more on software platforms and Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody's predicting the end of political TV ads anytime soon,
but strategists say the Internet is already an important campaign
tool, and they expect its role to expand in the future. In Georgia
this year, every major candidate for governor, lieutenant governor
and the U.S. Senate has a home on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm amazed by how far it's come in two (election) cycles,''
said Tony Fabrizio, the pollster for Republican gubernatorial
candidate Guy Millner.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see why candidates like the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike traditional news coverage, the Internet allows candidates
to give their views in an unfiltered context, without having to
answer questions from reporters or voters. And the cost
considerations that limit TV commercials to 30 or 60 seconds don't
apply, so Web pages can include more detailed positions on issues.
</P>
<P>
   For voters, the Internet is a fast way to find out things that
candidates want them to know, although it provides no way to pin
candidates down on subjects they wish to avoid. So far, there is no
evidence that a significant number of voters are actually making up
their minds on the basis of campaign Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't a persuasive medium in my opinion,'' said Raymond
Strother, a veteran media consultant who is working for Democratic
gubernatorial candidate Roy Barnes. ``I don't think anybody gets
any votes because of their Web content.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Strother's skepticism, the Barnes campaign has the most
comprehensive Web site of any Georgia candidate this year. In
addition to positions on issues and news clips, it allows surfers
with the proper technology to download copies of campaign TV
commercials. There's even a camera, stationed in the Barnes
campaign headquarters, that allows internet visitors to observe
staffers in action.
</P>
<P>
   Since the name of a candidate's campaign committee must be
featured in every TV and radio ad, Barnes named his committee after
his Web site. That way, when he gives the required information, he
is also plugging his site (barnesgovernor.org).
</P>
<P>
   The site is run by Barnes' 24-year-old son, Harlan, who holds a
degree in computer business from Furman University. ``This is a way
I can use my talents and help my dad,'' said Harlan Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   According to a counter on the site, more than 28,000 people have
visited the Barnes campaign page since it was started about a year
ago. While that number does not suggest the kind of traffic likely
to turn an election, Harlan Barnes said the site has been
especially valuable in keeping supporters informed about the
progress of the campaign, as if they were attending a virtual fish
fry every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very good tool for our campaign,'' admits Strother.
</P>
<P>
   Millner has had a Web address for months, but he recently hired
Intellimedia Commerce, a company that has designed sites for major
corporations like Value Jet and Heineken beer, to upgrade it. The
site (guymillner98.org) now boasts slick graphics, photos of
Millner on the campaign trail, and his positions on various issues.
</P>
<P>
   Millner's site does not have a counter, but Fabrizio believes
visits to all campaign sites will pick up between now and the Nov.
3 election.
</P>
<P>
   When Fabrizio worked for Republican Bob Dole's presidential
campaign in 1996, he advised Dole to recite his Web address during
a televised debate with President Clinton. In the next 24 hours,
Fabrizio said, the Dole Web page received ``several million'' hits,
causing several system crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Fabrizio believes younger voters are especially inclined to turn
to the Web for political information, just as they look there to
read movie reviews or purchase CDs. For that reason, he believes
the use of the Internet by campaigns will only increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a whole segment of the population, when they want to
get information, they get it instantaneously over the Web,''
Fabrizio said. ``You are communicating with them in their chosen
medium.''

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
Don't blame the Internet for the failings of humanity 
By Bill Husted  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The big news in technology this past week came from Carnegie
Mellon University in Pittsburgh, where researchers discovered that
people who spent hours and hours on the Internet each night didn't
have time left to have any real human relationships.
</P>
<P>
   And because of that, these cyber-junkies spent a lot of time
being depressed.
</P>
<P>
   What a surprise that was. It is roughly equivalent to
discovering that people who walk in the rain get wet and then long
to be dry.
</P>
<P>
   Here we have the research subjects, a hundred or so people in
Pittsburgh who _ instead of taking walks and hugging _ sit in front
of a computer monitor all night. And lo and behold, they have lousy
personal lives, lose touch with their families and feel terrible.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes researchers at fancy universities are so danged smart
they overlook the obvious.
</P>
<P>
   I think those Ph.D.s confused a symptom for the disease. Imagine
what they would have found if they surveyed people who spent almost
all their spare time playing golf, or dancing or watching TV. Do
you think their personal relationships would be any better? Would
the day magically have more hours in it?
</P>
<P>
   I'm the last person in the world to defend the sort of shallow
relationships spawned in the Internet's chat groups. I'd much
rather talk to someone I can see. And my guess is that most of the
friendships and the romances that develop there have the life span
of a fly. But I also think it is likely the same people would find
shallow and short-lived relationships in the real world. I'm saying
that it's not the Internet's doing; it's the people.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, some of these people with friendships and romances that
exist only in cyberspace are doing the best they can. People who
are shy or socially inept in real life sometimes become bold and
witty in the pretend world of the chat groups. My guess is that
many of them wouldn't have any relationships at all if not for the
Internet. I'm thinking that any human contact _ no matter how
flawed _ is better than none at all. So it's hard to judge.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing surprising about the fact new technology is seen
as magical, with exaggerated notions of how good it is or how evil
it is. That's a human reaction that dates all the way back to
primitive man. In the very earliest days, even fire was seen as a
spirit. When the first cameras came along, people were afraid the
images they took would capture our souls.
</P>
<P>
   In the Golden Age of Television, some social critics saw it as a
demonic force that would destroy civilization; others thought it
would automatically change tastes and make opera and theater lovers
out of the masses. Civilization may be a little battered, but it's
still around. And instead of being a nation of theater lovers, we
watch MTV.
</P>
<P>
   It's strange how little the human thinking process has changed.
We use different words and terms than medieval people, but we still
think new technology has magical powers. Instead of seeing the
Internet as the particularly complex and efficient delivery system
for data that it is _ a neutral pipeline that doesn't care what it
carries _ we believe the pipeline itself has a personality of its
own and powers far beyond what you'd expect from a bunch of wires
and fiber-optic cable.
</P>
<P>
   For what it's worth, I think people should worry more about
spending time with those they love than in trying to find witches
hiding in the Internet. It's a lot easier to blame technology than
ourselves for our failings. But when we do that, the problem
becomes unsolvable. We can't fix the technology; we can only fix
ourselves. Either that or move out of Pittsburgh.

IBM ViaVoice Gold doesn't sparkle enough 
By Jack Warner  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Continuing our small exploration of voice recognition programs,
we'll take a look today at IBM ViaVoice Gold, a program that has a
few startling similarities to Voice Xpress Plus but in general is a
quite different program.
</P>
<P>
   The similarities are really all in the setup routines. The user
is provided with a microphone nearly identical to that which comes
with the L&AMP;H program, and each user must also ``enroll'' by
uttering a lot of phrases into the mike to help the program sort
out voice differences.
</P>
<P>
   The differences are in the application of the two programs.
Voice Xpress Plus is pretty much a one-trick pony; it is tied to
Microsoft Word, or its own little word processor, and that's it.
</P>
<P>
   ViaVoice, on the other hand, can be used to some degree with
nearly anything. It's very slick at running Windows 95. Looking at
the desktop, for instance, you can say ``open calculator'' and just
like magic, up pops the calculator. You can then run the calculator
simply by saying something like ``seven plus 16 minus five
equals,'' and there's your answer.
</P>
<P>
   It is linked directly, in terms of dictation, to Word, WordPad
and its own little version of WordPad called SpeakPad. It will deal
with many situations in other programs, though. After a certain
amount of fumbling around, I got a connection to the Internet
verbally. I could open Netscape with no trouble, but it wouldn't
start Eudora Pro. However, once Eudora was open, I could minimize
and then maximize it.
</P>
<P>
   I seemed to have less trouble dictating through ViaVoice than
Voice Xpress, by which I mean that word recognition seemed more
accurate. It is a little slower at producing results than Voice
Xpress, which perhaps is a good thing. The instructions warn you
against getting overly concerned with the immediate results because
ViaVoice has a logic based on usage. I noticed several times that
it came up with something preposterous but soon changed it based on
subsequent dictation.
</P>
<P>
   However, presumably because it attempts to cover much more
ground, ViaVoice is more difficult to use than Voice Xpress.
</P>
<P>
   Voice Xpress is much slicker at operating Word in general. As I
remarked last week, it is remarkably accurate at discerning what
words you wish it to write down, and what words are program
commands. It is all very fluid when it works right _ which means,
essentially, when it understands what you're saying.
</P>
<P>
   ViaVoice, on the other hand, requires that you turn off
dictating mode _ ``stop dictation'' _ before you begin issuing
editing commands. And while Voice Xpress was fairly loose about how
you phrase your editing commands, ViaVoice is pretty strict. On top
of that, fragmented instructions make it seem a lot harder to learn
than it really is.
</P>
<P>
   To make either of these programs truly useful for extensive
dictation, they would have to work a whole lot better than they did
for me. Whether further enrolling would make them work better I
cannot say. It is interesting to note that while I got fewer
initial errors with ViaVoice, the errors I did get seemed to be
virtually uncorrectable.
</P>
<P>
   While we're on the subject of voice recognition, those of you
concerned about the security of your files might wish to look at a
new program from Veritel Corp. called Voicecrypt. Anyone attempting
to access files protected with Voicecrypt must then not only know
the password, but say it in your voice or they're locked out.

Hand-held phones enter another era 
By John Ghirardini  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hand-held cellular phones have taken another leap forward in the
arena of personal safety.
</P>
<P>
   Audiovox has unveiled the FoneFinder, a hand-held that can be
vehicle-mounted and has a Global Positioning Satellite receiver
built in to pinpoint the location of 911 callers. With a touch of
the large 911 button on the top of the phone, the phone and its GPS
receiver are turned on. A built-in speech chip announces the
caller's location to emergency dispatchers.
</P>
<P>
   With GPS and the speech chip, even an injured caller who can't
speak or someone who doesn't know exactly where he is can get help
fast.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 30 million cellular 911 calls made in a
year, but locating the caller has been a problem in the past. In
one case in South Dakota, it took three days to find a woman
stranded in a snowbank. She finally was spotted from the air.
</P>
<P>
   FoneFinder works with existing cellular infrastructure, so the
system should be both inexpensive and immediately deployable.
Commercial versions of the phone, which was demonstrated for the
first time at a conference in San Francisco on Aug. 26, will be
available in November. List price is $399.
</P>
<P>
   FoneFinder was developed by Tendler Cellular of Boston, which
joined with OKI Semiconductor of Sunnyvale, Calif., to provide the
speech component.
</P>
<P>
   All for one; one for all
</P>
<P>
   Folks who run a business out of their homes are always looking
for ways to be more efficient while saving a few bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp Electronics Corp. is trying to help with a new offering
that combines more functions than some Swiss army knives do.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp's six-in-one UX-2700CM combines plain paper fax, 600 dpi
color printer, color scanner, color copier, PC fax and phone into a
compact unit just 10 1/2 inches wide, 15 1/4 inches deep and 8 1/2
inches high.
</P>
<P>
   The UX also sports an infrared data port, allowing users to
print wirelessly from a notebook PC or other hand-held device with
infrared capability.
</P>
<P>
   The estimated retail price is $500. If that's too much, an
identical machine without the color capability, the UX-2200CM, is
available for $400. Both prices are about half what it would cost
to get each of the components separately.
</P>
<P>
   The machines are compatible with Windows 3.1, 95 and 98. Sharp
does not plan to offer a Macintosh version because of interface
difficulties, Sharp spokeswoman Lois Catala said.
</P>
<P>
   A separate reality
</P>
<P>
   The concept of equal pay for equal work hasn't turned into
reality for many of the nation's millions of working women.
</P>
<P>
   Now they can find out how much the pay gap is costing them at a
new Web site (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .aflcio.org/women/equalpay.htm) launched by the AFL-CIO.
Visitors can enter salary, age and education to find out what's
what. For example, an average 29-year-old woman with a college
degree will lose $990,000 to the gap over her career, according to
the labor group's figures.
</P>
<P>
   The site breaks down the wage gap by profession and state, and
includes a list of actions women can take to fight for equal pay in
the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   The eyes have it
</P>
<P>
   George Orwell's classic novel ``1984'' painted a stark picture
of a world in which war was peace and Big Brother watched every
move.
</P>
<P>
   Big Brother would have loved the advances in workplace software.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times recently reported on a new generation of
software that lets managers record virtually every keystroke an
employee makes _ without the worker knowing it.
</P>
<P>
   In August, software maker WinWhatWhere Corp. of Kennewick,
Wash., released Investigator, a program that records every
keystroke, command and mouse click entered on a PC. The program
costs $285 per computer, but the company will cut a deal for larger
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Tech Assist of Largo, Fla., began distributing Desktop
Surveillance, made by Omniquad in the United Kingdom. Desktop
Surveillance runs about $55 for each copy. The software can
automatically generate a log and e-mail it to a supervisor without
the employee's knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Both firms said they responded to a pent-up demand from
employers worried about workers wasting time on company PCs.
</P>
<P>
   WinWhatWhere President Richard Eaton told the Times there was
some soul-searching at his company about whether to produce the
software. ``It just seemed like too much, but it was the No. 1
request from our customers,'' Eaton said.

Hacking was inside job to promote MTV awards 
By Frances Katz  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MTV's Web site seems a prime candidate for teenage hackers who
like to mess with big-time sites. For a while last week, it looked
as if MTV had indeed been hacked. As it turns out, the defaced
start page was actually created by MTV itself as a promotion for
Thursday's ``MTV Video Music Awards.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Silicon Alley Reporter's editor, Jason McCabe Calacanis,
extracted a gleeful confession from MTV Tuesday, designers and
programmers who flood the mailing list of the World Wide Web
Artists Consortium were divided on the possibility the MTV site
could be hacked.
</P>
<P>
   In place of MTV's slick black Web pages was a bright yellow
message reading ``I'm in! I TOLD YOU GUYS I'D DO IT! Shoutouts to
milw0rm, vaporRub and Dave D. in Secacus! By the way, I've got
something serious planned for this Wednesday, so you better come
by. J.F.'' There was also faux spray paint across the MTV logo with
the words ``J.F. was here.'' (For those of you who missed it, the
altered home page is preserved at (http://www.nocturna.com
</P>
<P>
   /hacked.html).
</P>
<P>
   For the uninitiated, real hacking involves gaining illegal
access to a site's server and altering the code that makes the site
look the way it does. The designers and programmers on the WWWAC
list were nostalgically hoping it was a couple of kids from New
Jersey busting into the site, but most suspected MTV was behind the
hack. And if MTV was trying to sell something, they said, this was
a lame way to do it.
</P>
<P>
   MTV spokeswoman Caroline Mockridge said the J.F. stands for
Johnny Fame, a new MTV personality who will be covering the MTV
awards exclusively online. ``We wanted to present this personality
to our audience in a dramatic and media-appropriate way,'' she
said. ``You'll be surprised how his presence will manifest itself
between now and the awards show.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the most jaded Web denizen has to admit it's pretty clever
to make your own Web site look as if it had been hacked to generate
a buzz among your target audience _ high school and college kids
who routinely surf the Web, and the aging artsy/hipster types who
still watch MTV and frequent Internet mailing lists where
journalists tend to troll for information. As Magnavox used to say
in its TV ads, ``Smart. Very smart.''
</P>
<P>
   But most Net regulars did not believe the site had actually been
hacked. It's fairly easy to see why. Back in the dark ages of the
Internet _ about four or five years ago _ ``hacking'' or illegally
breaking into a Web site was something of a hobby. The fabled two
kids in a garage so integral to mythology of the Internet would
spend endless hours surrounded by computers, monitors and a pile of
blue, black, green and gray ``hacker'' boxes. Eventually, they'd
find their way into a site or a database and change billing records
or grade reports, look for stored credit card numbers or maybe
alter a few pages of text. Like graffiti artists, hackers had their
own ``signatures,'' as many on the WWWAC list pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1998, we live in an age of browsers that provide
encryption standards so powerful that users must verify the fact
they are U.S. citizens before even downloading either the Netscape
or Microsoft browser. With the recent boomlet in electronic
commerce, sites such as ESPN SportZone (which was hacked by an
employee last summer trying to prove how shoddy SportsZone's
security was) have more elaborate gatekeeping devices to keep
information from being hacked by outsiders than ever before. Online
banking services such as First Union won't even deliver banking
information unless its customers have the strongest encryption
technology available.
</P>
<P>
   Web sites must now go to great pains to prove their sites are
more secure than Fort Knox. A couple of kids from Secaucus, N.J.,
breaking into the MTV server and redesigning a couple of pages
would be a good laugh at corporate America's expense. But in the
new age of encryption, hacking a major Web site would have to be an
inside job _ just like the one at MTV.

BIG MARKETERS JOIN TO UPGRADE INTERNET ADS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seven top marketers are joining At Home Corp., which operates
the At Home Network Internet service, to create and test the
larger, more elaborate types of online advertising that were the
subject of a meeting last month on interactive marketing sponsored
by Procter &AMP; Gamble Co.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Bratton, advertising director for the At Home Network in
Redwood City, Calif., identified the marketers as AT&AMP;T Corp., the
Bank of America unit of BankAmerica Corp., First USA, Intel Corp.,
Johnson &AMP; Johnson, Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. and Toys ``R'' Us.
</P>
<P>
   The marketers will run ads that use so-called rich media
techniques, which take advantage of the large bandwidth, or network
carrying capacity, of At Home. Such ads are bigger than those now
usually associated with the Internet and can offer animation, sound
and full video.
</P>
<P>
   The test, to be conducted by IPSOS-ASI, a market research
company in Stamford, Conn., and co-sponsored by Intel, will
evaluate the effectiveness of the ads using traditional
measurements like recall, awareness and intent to purchase the
products advertised. Results are to be made available in December.

TRAVELERS BECOME THEIR OWN AGENTS THROUGH ON-LINE SERVICES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By GEORGE RAINE   
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thomas Kahler's lady friend, Paula, is a travel agent, so you
can imagine the conversations they have had since he became a
convert to do-it-yourself on-line travel arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty of it is you call it up, and it shows you all the
rates. You are not at the mercy of what they quote you _ you're not
in a negotiating session with a reservation clerk,'' Kahler said.
``It's so simple. Boom, boom, boom.''
</P>
<P>
   Kahler, a retiree who lives in Venice, Fla., is the voice of the
informed consumer taking charge _ exactly what the expanding world
of on-line travel wants to hear.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are extraordinary: In 1997, $777 million in on-line
airline bookings were made in the United States, according to
Jupiter Communications in New York, a media research firm. It is
expected that 1998 will end with $1.7 billion in bookings; by 2002
the figure is projected to be $7.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers still pale in comparison to the total sales of U.S.
travel agents _ $120 billion in 1997, up from $110 billion in 1996
_ who handle 80 percent of airline tickets and 95 percent of cruise
arrangements. Still, we are witnessing the nascent stirrings of
what may be a remarkable transformation in commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are coming upon an age of a new kind of consumer, one with
unprecedented access to product and service information,'' said Ken
Orton, president of San Francisco-based Preview Travel Inc. ``One
of the tools that has enabled that is the World Wide Web. You can
research products and gather all the information you need so that
when it is time to transact, you are a completely different kind of
buyer.''
</P>
<P>
   Preview Travel (www.previewtravel.com) employs 240 people and is
one of the three leading on-line travel service providers for
leisure and small-business travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Preview Travel and the other leaders in the emerging industry,
Fort Wort, Texas-based Travelocity (www.travelocity.com) and
Microsoft's Expedia (expedia.msn.com), along with scores of others
competing for market share, are competing with the old standard by
which producers of goods and services ``pushed out information
through a sales channel and really controlled what the consumer
saw,'' Orton said. Things are changing.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this era the consumer has flipped the tables. The consumer
is in control of the transaction,'' Orton said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Parsons, publisher of Arlington, Texas-based Best Fares
Discount Travel magazine and the operator of www.bestfares.com,
still likes hearing the sound of a travel agent's voice,
``particularly when something goes wrong,'' but he sees the
handwriting on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, the consumer needs to be more savvy, and they better
start to learn to use a computer because, if not, they are only
getting one of many products that could be offered to them,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of shots are being fired between the highly competitive
on-line travel providers. Orton predicts that only a few major
players will be left in business by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, they face stiff competition from suppliers _ that is,
airlines, hotels and car rental agencies with their own Internet
reservation services. In 1996, Jupiter estimated, 79 percent of
on-line travel bookings for leisure and small-business travelers
were completed through Expedia, Travelocity, Preview and the other
on-line agencies. In 1997 that dropped to 52 percent, said Jupiter
analyst Fiona S. Swerdlow in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``That sort of shift was going to happen anyway,'' she said,
``but it is still a healthy market, growing tremendously.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors know this is a distribution channel that is growing
and are willing to continue with their investments, but in the next
several years they will start to expect to see returns. That's when
the shakeout (will) occur,'' Swerdlow said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the strategies at Palo Alto, Calif.-based Internet Travel
Network (www.itn.net), Swerdlow noted, is to not only provide
bookings for on-line consumers but also license that booking
technology to corporations. ``They're making sure they are not
locked into one segment,'' she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On-line travel companies say business is brisk and growing.
</P>
<P>
   Expedia, launched in October 1996, said its bookings increased
400 percent between January 1997 and January 1998. More than $5
million a week is booked in travel reservations on Expedia,
according to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Its Expedia Travel Network offers a myriad of products and
services, including cruises, vacation packages, rail fares and
schedules, and more than 20,000 bed-and-breakfast listings.
</P>
<P>
   Suzi LeVine, product manager of Expedia, speaks with authentic
Microsoft passion: ``On-line travel and what we have done with
Expedia is, to me, the best example of how the Internet becomes
real to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Travelocity, owned by the Sabre Group, reached two milestones
last month: It had the on-line ticket industry's first $1 million
day and first $6 million week, the company said. It claims
Travelocity was the first on-line travel site to reach $3 million,
$4 million and $5 million in weekly sales. On-line travel providers
require registration, and Travelocity reports it has 3.5 million
registered members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to continue as a leader in Internet commerce, which
is projected to reach $41 billion in sales by 2002,'' said Terry
Jones, chief information officer of the Sabre Group, which launched
Travelocity in March 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Like Travelocity and Expedia, Preview Travel, which introduced
reservations service on AOL in May 1996, found that partnering was
key to its success. Last week, Preview formed a marketing alliance
with MasterCard to increase electronic commerce. It is also the
primary travel service on America Online, Excite, Lycos, SNAP and
USAToday.com.
</P>
<P>
   Preview is doing between $4 million and $5 million in bookings a
week, Orton said.

IBM TO OFFER DISK DRIVE OF TINY SIZE, BIG CAPACITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   International Business Machines Corp. plans to announce
Wednesday that it has developed an ultra-small, one-inch disk drive
aimed at the explosively growing market for hand-held computers and
consumer appliances like digital cameras and digital cellular
telephones.
</P>
<P>
   The drive, which will not be available commercially until
mid-1999, is particularly striking because it is intended to fit
into the same flash memory chip slots that are now standard in
digital cameras and other consumer devices.
</P>
<P>
   The new drive will store about 5 billion bits of information a
square inch, weigh about half as much as a golf ball and store as
much as 340 megabytes of information, or the equivalent of about
300 hefty novels.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the IBM disk advance offered further evidence that
the disk drive industry was now moving at a technological rate of
change in excess of the Moore's Law constant, which has marked
progress in the chip industry for more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's Law states that the number of transistors on a silicon
chip doubles every 18 months. In recent years, the disk drive
industry has matched this rate of progress, increasing storage
density at the rate of about 60 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
   The current advance is particularly striking because chip makers
have been boasting that their tiny chips will ultimately displace
rotating memory systems that were once as large as washing
machines.
</P>
<P>
   IBM, however, has now succeeded in forming an alliance with
compact flash manufacturers to create a standard that will permit
users to choose either flash memory chips or the new one-inch disk
drive interchangeably.
</P>
<P>
   The new system, which IBM calls the Microdrive, fits into a new
industry standard called a CompactFlash Type II slot that is
already in use by some digital camera makers like Canon Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The Microdrive can also be used with a standard PC card adapter
if a device does not have the new slot. IBM said that Canon,
Hewlett-Packard, Hitachi and Minolta were evaluating the new
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the issue was whether the market for consumer
devices beyond high-end digital cameras would emerge quickly enough
to justify the new small disk. The new drives are unlikely to be
used in existing laptops or even the newest generation of so-called
subnotebook laptops, which are using another type of small disk
drive that measures 2.5 inches and is coming in increasingly
thinner versions.
</P>
<P>
   IBM, which now controls 40 percent of that market, recently
began shipping a drive that is 9.5 millimeters thick, compared with
the current standard of 12.5 millimeters.

<P>
   ``This is an engineering marvel,'' said James Porter, president
of Disk/Trend Inc., a market research firm in Mountain View, Calif.
``However, they still have to create a new market. I think they
will probably take some time for these to develop.''

SUN AND MICROSOFT FACE OFF AT HEARING ON '96 JAVA PACT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ On the morning of March 12, 1996, after
all-night negotiations to hammer out final details, principals from
Sun Microsystems Inc. and Microsoft Corp. signed a deal under which
Sun licensed its promising Java technology to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the two companies, rivals again, squared off for a
three-day hearing in federal court to determine just what that
agreement meant. The resolution of the dispute could have
far-reaching implications for software makers and users.
</P>
<P>
   Sun contends that Microsoft has manipulated the Java programming
language to promote its stranglehold on the operating system
market. Microsoft, in turn, counters that Sun is using the
courtroom to accomplish what it cannot in the marketplace _ namely,
compete with Microsoft's Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   While the case is highly technical and esoteric, it could have a
wide impact. Sun has asked the government for a preliminary
injunction to prevent Microsoft from selling Windows 98 and the
Internet Explorer until it modifies the products to be Java
compatible.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the first day of testimony, a Microsoft executive told
Judge Ronald Whyte of U.S. District Court in San Jose that a
preliminary injunction could impact ``thousands, if not tens of
thousands'' of software developers. ``If there was an injunction,
it would impact worldwide shipments,'' said Robert Muglia, senior
vice president of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Java is a programming language that can be used to develop
software for use across different operating systems. Java permits
users of these different operating systems to share and gain access
to the same programs.
</P>
<P>
   Sun contends that in 1996, Microsoft agreed it would create
versions of Java that maintained this essence of widespread
compatibility. Instead, Sun said that very soon after the agreement
was reached, Microsoft began releasing versions of Java to be used
to develop software exclusively for use on Microsoft operating
systems. Sun sued on Oct. 7, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, in light of the imminent release by Microsoft of
Windows 98, Sun asked the court to grant a preliminary injunction
that would be satisfied with one of three conditions: that Windows
98 include a fully compatible version of Java; that Microsoft
bundle Sun's version of Java with Windows 98, or that Microsoft
remove any incompatible programs from Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Sun officials declined to comment today, noting that they were
scheduled to present evidence on Wednesday. In its motion filed on
May 14 seeking a preliminary injunction, Sun argued that
``Microsoft is drawing on its vastly superior distribution channels
for desktop operating systems and browsers to inundate the market
for desktop computers with an unlicensed, incompatible version of
Sun's Java environment,'' according to a statement by the company.
</P>
<P>
   The motion called the attempt, ``a blatant effort to devalue
Sun's technology and establish its own, corrupted version as a de
facto industry standard.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said in court today that it understood its agreement
with Sun to mean Microsoft would be allowed to effectively create
two versions of Java, one that passes Sun's test for widespread
compatibility, and one intended for use with Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Muglia, the Microsoft executive, said Sun was unfairly trying to
control programming language that was essential to the Windows
operating system and that was outside the purview of the agreement.

MICROSOFT ASKS COURT TO DISMISS ANTITRUST SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a long, derisive court brief, Microsoft Corp.
asked a federal judge Tuesday to dismiss the government's antitrust
suit, arguing that the Justice Department and 20 states were trying
to ``distract the court from the fatal defects in their claims by
slinging as much mud as they can.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft was answering a Justice Department brief filed last
week that detailed new evidence accusing Microsoft of trying to
tyrannize several competing companies, including Intel Corp., Apple
Computer Inc. and Intuit Corp., maker of the Quicken accounting
software.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft trial is scheduled to begin Sept. 23.
</P>
<P>
   In its response, filed Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for
the District of Columbia, Microsoft made little effort to dispute
the new charges, saying they were ``irrelevant facts given in a
desperate attempt to cloud the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Microsoft's lawyers, pursuing a strategy first laid out
in a court hearing last week, offered counter arguments only to the
specific charges and statements spelled out in the original lawsuit
filed last May. Any other evidence uncovered since then does not
belong in the case, the company argued. And if the trial judge,
Thomas Penfield Jackson, disagrees _ as he has already suggested he
might _ Microsoft lawyers say the company will ask him to delay the
trial for six months.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday's brief is a final effort to persuade the judge to
dismiss the case. ``We believe the case should be dismissed now,
without a long and costly trial,'' said William Neukom, Microsoft's
senior vice president for law and corporate affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft dismissed the government's presentation of new
evidence without discussing the original charges as ``revealing a
profound lack of confidence in the case they filed in May.''
Microsoft also said that the new accusations were unfounded and
that some ``are nothing but a smear tactic.''
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the brief included refutations of the core charges
in the original suit, particularly the allegation that Microsoft
was illegally bundling Internet Explorer, the browser used to
navigate the World Wide Web, with the Windows operating system.
Bundling the two, the government has argued, was an attempt to
cripple Netscape Communications Corp., maker of the principle
competing Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has long argued that the browser, Internet Explorer,
and Windows, are one product, impossible to separate. Central to
the Microsoft argument is a letter from Netscape lawyers to
Assistant Attorney General Joel Klein six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said the letter would prove that ``Netscape itself has
already conceded that it is impossible to remove Internet Explorer
technologies from Windows 98 without causing serious damage to the
operating system.''
</P>
<P>
   Until it was made public Tuesday, the letter had been part of
confidential court filings.
</P>
<P>
   The Netscape letter said: ``We are totally unable to provide
examples of files that can or cannot be deleted from Windows 98
since, as we discussed this week, it is our understanding that it
simply is not possible to delete any portion of Internet Explorer,
or of browsing functionality, from Windows 98 as presently
configured without severely interfering with the operating
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers disagreed with that assessment. ``The
Microsoft statement is nothing new,'' the Justice Department said
in a statement Tuesday. ``We look forward to proving in the
upcoming trial that Microsoft has engaged in a series of
anti-competitive acts.''
</P>
<P>
   Another part of the government's antitrust suit charges
Microsoft with forcing Internet service companies to support
Internet Explorer, not Netscape, in exchange for receiving
promotional space on a part of the main Windows screen known as the
Channel Bar.
</P>
<P>
   In its brief, Microsoft does not dispute that it followed such a
policy but added that it voluntarily suspended the policy for some
of the companies last winter. Furthermore, it contended that the
government must prove that someone was harmed by the policy for it
to be a supportable charge, and that has not been done.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Microsoft said, the remaining agreements ``expire on
September 30, 1998, and Microsoft has informed'' the relevant
companies ``that Microsoft will not be renewing any of those
agreements because the Channel Bar concept has not been
sufficiently popular with consumers and is thus being
discontinued.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Surely,'' the brief added, ``there are more productive uses of
this Court's resources than holding a trial to rule on the legality
of waived provisions in contracts that are about to expire and that
will not be renewed _ especially when those provisions were not
anticompetitive in the first place.''

CITING NETSCAPE LETTER, MICROSOFT AGAIN SEEKS DISMISSAL OF 
ANTITRUST CASE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By MICHAEL PAULSON   
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a document that Microsoft says undermines the
government's case against it, a Netscape attorney wrote to the
Justice Department in March and admitted that the Internet browsing
function cannot be removed from Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft filed the letter with a 48-page brief Tuesday renewing
the company's call that the government's antitrust case should be
dismissed. U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson is scheduled
to hear arguments on that question Friday. If he does not dismiss
the case, the trial is scheduled to begin Sept. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's brief continued the recent escalation in rhetoric
used by the warring sides in the highly publicized legal battle.
Microsoft accused the government of ``blatant misrepresentation,''
``a smear tactic,'' ``vague and constantly changing allegations,''
``a profound lack of confidence in the case they filed in May,''
and ``a baseless personal attack on the credibility of Microsoft's
CEO.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They attempt to distract the court from the fatal defects in
their claims by slinging as much mud as they can at the defendant
(Microsoft) and by giving prominence to numerous irrelevant facts
in a desperate attempt to cloud the issues,'' Microsoft said in its
brief. ``Plaintiffs (the federal and state governments) apparently
hope that a combination of overblown rhetoric and the sheer volume
of paper they have submitted in opposition to Microsoft's motion
will lead the court to throw up its hands in frustration, conclude
there must be disputed issues of fact and deny Microsoft's motion
(for dismissal) without seriously considering the sufficiency of
plaintiffs' claims.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department shrugged off the latest filing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft's reply is nothing new,'' said Justice Department
spokeswoman Gina Talamona. ``We look forward to proving at the
upcoming trial that Microsoft engaged in a series of
anti-competitive acts to maintain its operating system monopoly and
to extend that monopoly to Internet browsers.''
</P>
<P>
   In its case against Microsoft, the Justice Department and the
attorneys general of 20 states and the District of Columbia accuse
the Redmond-based software giant of illegally seeking to extend a
monopoly on computer operating systems into the market for Internet
browsers. The illegally anti-competitive acts allegedly included
forcing consumers to use Microsoft's Internet browser by
integrating the browser into the ubiquitous Windows operating
system, and forcing computer manufacturers, Internet service
providers, Internet content providers and online service providers
to promote Microsoft's Internet browser through various licensing
deals.
</P>
<P>
   In its brief yesterday, Microsoft said there is no evidence to
support any of those claims, and cited the letter from Netscape
Communications Corp. attorney Allen Snyder to Justice Department
antitrust chief Joel Klein.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, Snyder said ``we are totally unable to provide
examples of files that can or can not be deleted from Windows 98
since ... it is our understanding that it simply is not possible to
delete any portion of IE (Internet Explorer), or of browser
functionality, from Windows 98 as presently configured without
severely interfering with the operating system.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said the letter shows the browser is an integral part
of the operating system, and not an add-on inserted for
anti-competitive reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also claimed that it has canceled all of the offending
licensing deals to answer any concerns about Netscape's ability to
distribute its own competitor browser to consumers. Microsoft said
it dropped controversial licensing deals with Internet service and
content providers ``because they were generating negative publicity
and because Microsoft determined that they were not commercially
significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also said it is discontinuing the controversial
``channel bar,'' a feature that allowed consumers to move easily to
World Wide Web sites of Microsoft's paying partners, such as
Disney. The feature was unpopular among Microsoft critics, who
worried the company was starting to control what types of content
consumers would see on the Internet. More importantly, the feature
also proved unpopular with consumers, Microsoft said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said it does not expect to include the ``Channel Bar''
in upgrades or future versions of Windows 98.

IMPEACHMENT PANIC 
</HEADLINE>
  By WILLIAM SALETAN 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   To hear the pundits tell it, President Clinton is toast. On
Sunday's political chat shows, they feasted on forecasts by Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., and Rep. Jim Moran, D-Va., that
Clinton will face impeachment proceedings. Congressional Democrats
appear to be ``done with him,'' says a party consultant.
</P>
<P>
   But the pundits' stock market in Clinton's political survival is
greatly oversold, as the result of a combination of factors.
</P>
<P>
   1. Short selling. Facing re-election this November,
congressional Democrats are playing up the possibility of
impeachment in order to distance themselves from Clinton. They've
been rushing to unload their stock in him out of fear that Kenneth
Starr's report, now in Congress' hands but still unread, includes
unforeseen bombshells. What sort of bombshells? Nobody knows. The
point of unforeseen bombshells is that they're unforeseen. We'll
believe the bombshells when we see them.
</P>
<P>
   2. Gravitas frenzy. Ever since Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn.,
condemned Clinton's behavior in a Senate floor speech last
Thursday, Democrats have been rushing to microphones to join in the
collective rebuke. The pundits think these speeches signal a
growing willingness to impeach Clinton. But this theory is too
kind. The timing and wording of recent remarks by Clinton's
congressional critics indicate that most of them are more
interested in advertising their own morals than in condemning his.
Likewise, they express more interest in immersing themselves in the
``solemn duty'' of weighing impeachment than in actually impeaching
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   3. ``Floodgate'' flood. The press loves to construe political
collapse as an objective, inexorable process. Pundits are calling
Lieberman's speech the beginning of the end--in the words of George
Will, ``a consequential pebble'' that will start ``an avalanche.''
The avalanche of avalanche metaphors, flood of flood metaphors, and
stampede of stampede metaphors are well underway. But in the end,
they're just metaphors.
</P>
<P>
   4. Regurgitory reflex. Democrats who are genuinely disgusted
with Clinton want to express their revulsion and reassure the
public that Congress doesn't condone his behavior. But Congress
doesn't have to impeach Clinton in order to convey its disapproval,
any more than it has to ban gangsta rap. In fact, by venting its
outrage in words today, Congress is relieving internal pressure to
vent that outrage in impeachment tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Together, these fears, frenzies, and fallacies have produced a
political stock market panic wholly disproportionate to the two
fundamental questions. Those questions are:
</P>
<P>
   1) Once the moral outrage has been aired and the question before
Congress has been distilled to whether the president should be
forced from office for the first time in U.S. history, will 67 U.S.
senators vote aye?
</P>
<P>
   2) Will Clinton resign unless Congress is certain to impeach
him?
</P>
<P>
   The least interesting and most salient fact about this scandal
is that the answer to both those questions is still no.

TOYOTA OFFERS GLIMPSE OF FUTURE WITH HYBRID CAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLAIRE HUGHES  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Toyota Motor Corp. is rolling out a new
hybrid-powered car for a test drive.
</P>
<P>
   But the part-gas, part-electricity-powered Prius (pronounced
PREE-us) won't be available in the United States for two more
years, when Toyota plans to have 20,000 available for the European
and North American markets.
</P>
<P>
   The company has been driving the Prius around the country to
raise interest among American consumers, who pay less for gas than
Japanese drivers and do not place as high a priority on the car's
touted fuel efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing the Prius to American consumers will take some
educating, Toyota officials said Wednesday during a stop in Albany.
And some tweaking, too _ like revving up the power in the car's
small 1.5-liter engine and improving the fuel efficiency on the
highway, where Americans do far more of their driving than Japanese
do.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the Prius does its best in congested city driving,
getting 66 miles per gallon in Tokyo at average speeds of 7 mph,
Toyota officials said. That's because the electric battery fuels
the car at lower speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota's goal is to achieve fuel efficiency of 60 mpg for
combined city and highway driving before introducing the car to the
U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   In the Japanese market, where consumers pay $3 to $4 for a
gallon of gasoline, the cars have been selling like sushi _ faster,
in fact, than Toyota's production capacity can currently handle.
About 7,700 have been sold since December, when the cars were
introduced.
</P>
<P>
   Because there are two power sources, the car is unlike fully
electric vehicles. It requires no recharging and can travel
unlimited distances. Still, Toyota officials said, it achieves
significant reductions over gasoline-powered vehicles in use of
greenhouse and other noxious gases.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have a benefit to the air, you have to have the vehicles
out in use,'' said Michael Love, Toyota's national manager of
regulatory affairs. Toyota's research has shown that consumer
interest in fully electric cars has dropped with more knowledge of
the cars' inconveniences.
</P>
<P>
   Albany was the 12th of 13 cities in a national tour Toyota began
in July. The dozen others are bigger cities with greater pollution
problems _ such as Los Angeles, Chicago and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   But Albany was an important stop for its own reasons. Until late
last month, when two automobile manufacturers' trade groups won a
legal appeal, New York was attempting to maintain the strictest
standards in the country for moving toward so-called zero-emission
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Now New York will follow standards set by California, which
require that by 2003 about 10 percent of an automaker's sales be
ZEVs _ essentially fully electric cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we're trying to get publicity for these vehicles is
to show the (state) Legislature that there's an alternative to
straight electric cars,'' said Wade Hoyt, public relations manager
for Toyota Motor Sales' Northeast region.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, the Prius is currently selling for the equivalent of
about $16,000. The exterior of the bubble-shaped car _ a design
that Toyota is also experimenting with _ is about the size of a
compact Corolla, but the interior is nearly as spacious as the
midsize Camry.
</P>
<P>
   The price represents a loss for Toyota, which won't reveal its
cost for production. Jeremy Barnes, Toyota's Los Angeles-based
product safety and environment administrator, said that the company
would break even on the Prius if it could increase current
production volume to 20,000, or in five years based on current
production volume.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said Toyota is investing in the knowledge needed to
compete in the automobile marketplace of the future. The company
wants to be ahead of the curve in developing cars that come not
only in different colors but different fuel sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a complete mind shift in what we use in transportation,''
Barnes said.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Environmental Advocates, an Albany-based environmental group,
sees the Prius as a great alternative to cars powered exclusively
by gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see it as a real immediate, sort of short-term solution to
a very serious air-quality problem that we have,'' said Cori Traub,
the group's air and energy project director.
</P>
<P>
   But what the environmental group would really like to see is
Americans changing their driving habits, using fully electric
vehicles for everyday driving and a hybrid vehicle like the Prius
as a second car.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that the culture should be changed and can be
changed,'' Traub said.
</P>
<P>
   From a business perspective, Toyota is more pragmatic. Company
officials profiled the primary market for the vehicle: Customers
are generally male, professional, affluent, educated,
technologically adept, concerned about the environment,
conservative and practical.
</P>
<P>
   That person exists in about 8 percent of households, Toyota
officials said.

IMAGINING MADELEINE ALBRIGHT ... 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Talking about sex scandals among the powerful
and elected, national Republican strategist Greg Mueller said: ``To
run in 2000, as a prospective presidential candidate in particular,
you're going to have to be Mr. or Mrs. Clean.''
</P>
<P>
   P.C. as Mueller's warning is _ may we all live long enough to
see a woman from a major party run for president _ have you noticed
that only Mrs. Clean seems to get elected or appointed to public
office?
</P>
<P>
   Can you imagine Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., or former Sen.
Nancy Landon Kassebaum, R-Kan., asking her constituents to overlook
the fact that she gave birth to a child that was fathered by a man
other than her husband, refused for 17 years to publicly
acknowledge the child but felt she'd done the responsible thing
because she'd paid child support?
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., asked just that last week after
admitting he had had a child in an extramarital affair.
</P>
<P>
   If you work all day, can you conjure up the revelation of an
extramarital affair by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright with a
male aide less that half her age?
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, I was at a dinner where a bright, sensitive woman
in her 20s said she actually wished for the Albright scenario. Such
an occurrence, she said, would demonstrate that females finally had
achieved power and status parity with men; Albright's clout, not
her looks or youth, would be the aphrodisiac.
</P>
<P>
   While I understand the young woman's reasoning _ power has made
princes of many a male toad _ I couldn't disagree with it more.
Likely, this is because I took all the stuff I learned as a
'60s-vintage feminist to heart. Still do.
</P>
<P>
   That stuff does not include a belief that women are better than
men and better off without them, or that feminism means you don't
like red-hot heterosexual sex. Despite nearly four decades of
evidence to the contrary _ millions of married and cohabiting
feminists in love with their men _ those myths about feminism
refuse to die.
</P>
<P>
   What the stuff does include is a belief in and commitment to a
human value system that links desirability to something a little
more profound than big boobs or the ability to veto legislation. It
is a value system in which the aphrodisiacs for both women and men
are traits like intelligence, honesty, courage, compassion, humor
and a true heart. The most powerful people would possess such
traits in spades.
</P>
<P>
   Is this an impossible dream? Maybe. But I'll never stop
believing in it or working for it. Besides, it sure beats thinking
about Madeleine Albright lying to a grand jury and some young man
hanging onto a pair of stained blue trousers.

IN REELING RUSSIA, STATES ACTING ALONE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ With Russia reeling from its worst economic crisis in
years, and Moscow deadlocked in a power struggle over a new
government, the country's regional leaders, fearing famine and mass
protest, are trying to solve their problems on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to stem a desperate rush for goods not seen since the
1991 breakup of the Soviet Union, Russia's governors have traded
the invisible hand of the market for the iron fist of centralized
rule.
</P>
<P>
   As the ruble currency rapidly loses its value and prices
skyrocket, regional leaders have slapped price controls on staple
items, issued limits on trade, and halted payments of taxes to the
federal government in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Some regions have declared an economic state of emergency.
Others have talked of Russia's need to devolve into a loose
confederation of independent states. Some observers are predicting
something much worse: a nightmare scenario of 89 impoverished
mini-states sprawled across Russia's nine time zones from the
Pacific Ocean to the Baltic, some with nuclear weapons, each with
its own economy, armed forces, and bones to pick with its
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   While there is no sign yet that any of Russia's regions want to
follow the path taken by Chechnya in 1994 and declare their
independence, politicians and analysts are concerned that weakened
federal authorities are rapidly losing what power they have to
prevent regional leaders from doing whatever they want.
</P>
<P>
   So far, President Boris N. Yeltsin and the State Duma, the lower
house of parliament, have been too wrapped up in their standoff
over who will lead the next government to concern themselves with
what is going on in Russia's regions.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the absence of an agreement among the major political
players in Moscow, the country could dissolve,'' said Nikolai
Petrov, a specialist on regional politics for the Moscow Carnegie
Center. ``The breakup of Russia is a very real possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The influential Moscow newspaper Kommersant Daily went a step
further last week, printing a map of the Russia of the future,
divided up into 10 regional groupings.
</P>
<P>
   Added Russian lawmaker Grigory Yavlinsky: ``Yeltsin runs the
risk of going down in history as the president who oversaw the
dissolution of Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   The governors themselves say they are trying to prevent a
breakdown into anarchy. They say that they are the ones who will
have to answer for a new round of hyperinflation and poverty to
angry citizens who have already suffered through seven years of
hardship during Russia's move away from a centralized economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``By regulating prices, I am on the brink of breaking the law,
but I think these actions are justified,'' said Alexander I. Lebed,
the governor of the huge Krasnoyarsk region in Siberia. ``I am
determined to avert famine in the region. We must stop crowds of
hungry people from turning out in the streets and pillaging
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The rapid fall in the ruble's value has threatened to halt food
imports to Russia, which make up between 60 and 65 percent of food
products sold across the country, and up to 85 percent in Moscow.
Many foreign companies, worried about a banking system on the verge
of collapse, have already canceled deliveries to Russia, Foreign
Trade Minister Andrei Kushneryenko said last week. And Russian
importers, wary of the plunging value of the ruble, are unwilling
to spend their dollars on food items abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Arkady Volsky, head of Russia's industrialist union,
said that food imports are down to 10 percent of their level before
Aug. 17, when the government abandoned its efforts to support the
Russian currency.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the ruble has dropped from just over 6 to the dollar
to as low as 20.90 to the dollar Tuesday. Wednesday, the Russian
currency strengthened to 15.77 to the dollar in a day when rubles
suddenly became scarce and banks appeared to be selling off
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Russian media reported shortages across the country in food,
medicine, and other basic goods.
</P>
<P>
   By exerting control over their regional economies, governors are
expressing their lack of confidence in market-oriented policies
that the Kremlin has haltingly sought to impose on a national
level. But what Yeltsin and his advisers have been calling ``market
reforms'' are viewed by people in outlying regions much the same
way people used to think of the directives of the Soviet Communist
Party Central Committee: a promise of a better future that turned
out to be a big hoax.
</P>
<P>
   A number of governors have followed Lebed's lead on price
controls, even though the practice is bound to make the situation
worse. Much of the food in stores across Russia is imported, which
means its ruble price is related to the cost in hard currency of
bringing it into the country. The most likely effect of price
controls is that stores will go out of business, causing even more
panic. Other regions have restricted ``foreign trade'' with
neighboring Russian regions, a practice intended to stimulate the
growth of regional producers. In fact, the restrictions have made
it harder for food producers to find buyers for their goods.
</P>
<P>
   A more drastic form of civil disobedience has been taken up by
Lebed's brother, Alexei, the governor of the Siberian region of
Khakassia just south of Krasnoyarsk, who ordered his administration
to stop making tax payments to Moscow. In recent weeks, Lebed's
initiative has been copied by the leaders of the vast Siberia
region of Sakha-Yakutia, home to Russia's most lucrative gold and
diamond mines, and Kaliningrad, the base of Russia's Baltic Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, there is little Yeltsin can do to rein in regional
leaders. Governors have long run things the way the like, closing
down newspapers, fixing elections, spending federal money intended
for wages on personal projects. There have been protests, but
little action from the Kremlin, which depends on the governors, and
the Federation Council, the upper house of parliament made up of
regional leaders, for political support in its battles with the
opposition-dominated Duma.
</P>
<P>
   Most federal institutions are weak, while regional leaders have
fashioned their governments into latter-day fiefdoms, part of
Russia but managed independently. An apathetic and disenfranchised
public had little to say about this situation even before the
latest crisis. The federally funded army, police, and security
forces tend to be no less loyal to the local governor, who is far
more accessible than the far-off federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The main lever of influence the federal government has over
regional authorities has been the budget. But with no government in
place, that influence has disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real danger is a return to feudalism and an agricultural
economy, or in other words, a disintegration into regional
states,'' wrote Yulia Latynina, a political analyst for Expert
magazine. ``The problem with this particular outcome is that the
West would have to deal with 88 nuclear powers ... with leaders no
more competent than Saddam Hussein or Moammar Khadafy.''

A ROTTEN LACK OF APPLE SOFTWARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The cute little Apple iMac is now safely bolted onto my desk,
safe from the jealous fingers of my colleagues. And despite my
credentials as a Mac curmudgeon, I'm determined to give it a fair
trial. In another week I'll be using it almost exclusively.
</P>
<P>
   Already, it's shaping up as a traumatic experience. There's a
lot of good software that's unavailable for Apple machines. And
some of it is useful for the kind of Web-based research that takes
up a quarter of my typical day.
</P>
<P>
   In those long-ago days when Digital Equipment Corp. was still an
independent company, its AltaVista Internet division gave away a
fine little program that created an index of all the text files on
a PC. AltaVista Personal Search let you look up any Web page or
e-mail message on your hard drive in seconds. It was a splendid
utility, all the better for being free.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Digital has been absorbed by Compaq Computer Corp.,
AltaVista Personal Search has survived, with a better name and
improved performance. Now called AltaVista Discovery, the free
software is a powerful all-around Web search tool.
</P>
<P>
   Once installed on a PC, Discovery lurks in a toolbar at the top
of the screen. There's a field for typing in search requests. As
before, the software gives you fast access to all of your own
files. But Discovery also features a direct link to the main
AltaVista search engine on the Internet. The same toolbar will let
you run a search of more than 100 million Web pages, and thousands
of Usenet message boards.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Compaq took over, AltaVista had made a commitment to
become the most international of Web search services. There are
separate AltaVista indexes for Canada, Europe, Asia, and Latin
America. Discovery lets you search each of these, or all of them
together. You can also search in any of 25 languages, including
some unexpected offerings like Icelandic and Latvian.
</P>
<P>
   Another flashy feature automatically scans and summarizes Web
pages. Discovery will reduce a lengthy treatise on software design
or vegetable gardening to a few usually-well-chosen sentences. An
experienced researcher can do just as well by quickly skimming the
page. Still, when you consider that computers are dumb as rocks,
training them to ``read'' and ``understand'' documents is no mean
feat.
</P>
<P>
   Especially when you get it all for free. Users of Windows 95,
98, or NT computers can go to the AltaVista Web site
(http://www.altavista.com) and help themselves. There's no Mac
version _ a fact I could once have dismissed with a shrug. Not any
more.
</P>
<P>
   My frustration has grown since I came across another impressive
Windows-only search tool. For years, various programmers have
devised products to scan several Internet search engines at once.
I've tried a host of them, but none are quite so slick as Copernic
98 from the Canadian firm Agents Technologies Corp.
(http://www.copernic.com).
</P>
<P>
   Copernic 98 is free for the basic version, or $29.95 for the
more advanced Copernic 98 Plus. Most people will probably get along
just fine with the free version, which can simultaneously search up
to 30 Internet search services. The high-end model lets you search
a variety of highly specialized search engines, including some that
most users know nothing about.
</P>
<P>
   Say you're looking for a job. There are plenty of job-search
sites on the Web. But rather than find them one by one, a Copernic
98 Plus user lets the software do the heavy lifting. Copernic 98
Plus automatically checks 12 career Web sites, including The
Monster Board, Career.com, and HeadHunter.Net. Copernic 98 Plus
offers many other search categories _ news, movies, sports, games,
financial information, among others.
</P>
<P>
   The software can download copies of the pages it finds, so you
can view them later. It will e-mail your search results to a friend
or colleague. And since search services often list pages that no
longer exist, Copernic 98 can filter out all the ``dead links'' it
finds.
</P>
<P>
   Copernic is too cool a tool to lay aside. Lucky for me that my
old PC will still remain on hand. But machine-hopping is a
head-swiveling nuisance. And so, to those who bemoan the shortage
of Mac software, I add my own high-pitched whine. How about
producing Copernic and AltaVista Discovery for the Mac? How hard
can it be?

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After a year when 34 students nationwide died from
binge drinking, the reaction of those on a national list of ``Top
Ten Party Schools'' was easily scripted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mortified,'' said Mary Thomas, the dean of students at Trinity
College in Hartford, where that designation prompted a ban on
possession of hard liquor this year.
</P>
<P>
   Less predictable were the responses from those on the list of
``Top Ten Stone Cold Sober Schools.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just not an accurate picture of this campus,'' insisted
Mount Holyoke spokesman Kevin McCaffrey.
</P>
<P>
   The umbrage on either side suggests the struggles schools face
to frame workable policies on alcohol amid much-publicized
crackdowns on campus drinking.
</P>
<P>
   No one, of course, advocates binge drinking, and everyone
recognizes that students recovering from an alcohol-induced stupor
can't do what their parents are paying tens of thousands of dollars
to do _ which is, after all, learn. But alumni, students, and,
privately, even administrators express some ambivalence about the
get-tough policies that will greet many students this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Schools end up in a delicate balancing act, between averting
tragedy and recognizing time-honored rites of passage, between zero
tolerance and zero fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely a tension,'' said Joel Epstein of the
Higher Education Center for Alcohol and Other Drug Prevention in
Newton, which tracks the number of alcohol-related deaths. ``A lot
of us who went to these schools, who are teaching at these schools,
have fond memories of coming of age, and part of that is
experimenting with alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools are in a tough spot: They want to make things safe,
but there is this sense that this is what college is about. For
young people ... the mixed messages are a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   The University of Massachusetts at Amherst devotes the bulk of
its most recent campus magazine to ``Thinking About Drinking.''
While it discusses the university's new efforts to get tough on
binge drinking with a ``three strikes and you're out'' policy, it
also waxes woozy about the pleasures of drink, with a warmly lit
cover shot of a now-defunct Amherst bar, a nostalgic history of
drink, and a fond memoir written by a former fraternity member.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the complications of this particular cultural quandary
is that alcohol is so deeply embedded in the fabric of college
life,'' said a letter from the editor, Patricia Wright.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey of alumni, the letter notes, 20 percent mentioned
one of many local bars as the place they called home during their
college years.
</P>
<P>
   ``For these alumni and thousands like them,'' Wright continued,
``drinking was among the unregretted pleasures of campus life.
Doubtless it remains so for many, if not most, students today.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Vasconcellos, the assistant dean of students who helped
write a task force report on alcohol on the campus, added,
``There's this awareness about alcohol; on the other hand, there's
also this feeling that college is the place where you do that. I
think we're in a really odd time in that way.''
</P>
<P>
   And crackdown or not, the same is true on many campuses.
</P>
<P>
   As the weekend arrived at Boston College, even freshmen who had
been on campus for a mere five days were savvy enough to know how
to buy beer, and at which pubs their friends were gathering.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you really want to find it, you can get it,'' said Jennifer
Casper, 18, a freshman from Washington, D.C. ``They gave us this
whole scary thing during orientation about how there'd be no
tolerance, but a lot of that is just talk. So far, it doesn't seem
like it's been that tough.''
</P>
<P>
   The legal drinking age in all the New England states is 21.
</P>
<P>
   Students recognize their schools' interests in reducing binge
drinking _ and its attendant risks of assault, date rape, and
vandalism. At the same time, they expect that partying will be as
much a part of college life as classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``College is synonymous with drinking, taking those risks,''
said Tom Pettit, a 19-year-old BC sophomore from St. Louis. ``It's
sad to say, but it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Randy Winters, a 19-year-old from Philadelphia, ``We're
responsible adults now; we should be the ones deciding what we do
with our weekends.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how tightly college life and alcohol are tied is revealed
each year in the Princeton Review college guide's top 10 lists. A
spot on the sober side might attract parents concerned about
safety. But it also might deter potential students.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people see `Stone Cold Sober,' they wrongly get the
impression that this is a school where students devote all their
time to study and serious pursuit,'' Mt. Holyoke's McCaffrey said.
``On the other hand, if that raises issues for us, what does that
mean?''
</P>
<P>
   Most colleges, he says, would like to end up on neither list.
</P>
<P>
   More and more colleges began adopting stricter policies against
underage drinking after a widely publicized Harvard School of
Public Health study in 1993 said that 44 percent of students
surveyed on 116 campuses had reported so-called binge drinking,
consuming four to five or more drinks in an evening. At
fraternities and sororities, the percentage of binge drinkers about
doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Last year presented more tragic reasons for crackdowns: a death
at Louisiana State University, five at Virginia colleges, and the
death of fraternity pledge Scott Krueger at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, hardly known as a party school.
</P>
<P>
   But those who track college policies say there is still more
tolerance than there is toughness.
</P>
<P>
   ``There clearly isn't any trend among universities nationwide to
suddenly get tough,'' said Arthur G. Broadhurst, a senior vice
president of United Educators Insurance, which insures most US
schools. ``There is a flurry of concern after a crisis, but then it
tends to be business as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   The ambivalence about how best to deal with alcohol on campus
extends to the researchers who helped make binge drinking the No. 1
crisis. Some, such as those behind the Harvard study, advocate
get-tough policies.
</P>
<P>
   But others say hysteria about binge drinking only encourages
students to think it is the norm _ just at an age when they seek to
conform to the norm. Newer campaigns focus on convincing students
that experimenting with alcohol doesn't have to mean getting
falling-down drunk.

CLINTON SCANDAL: SPREADING STAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The man who used the term ``feeding frenzy'' to describe media
intrusion into the private lives of public figures predicts a
virulent new outbreak with independent counsel Kenneth Starr's
release of his report on the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's inevitable that we will see a Dan Burton-like
torrent of dirt and slime and sleaze,'' said Larry Sabato, author
of ``Feeding Frenzy: How Attack Journalism Has Transformed American
Politics.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Sabato, Burton _ the Republican chairman of the
House Government Reform and Oversight Committee who once referred
to the president as a ``scumbag'' _ is the first but probably not
the last victim of collateral fallout from the Clinton-Lewinsky
episode. Last week, worried that journalists were prying into his
personal life, Burton admitted fathering a child in an adulterous
relationship. There is speculation that similarly unsavory stories
could surface about other legislators once the sordid details in
Starr's report emerge.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Feeding Frenzy,'' Sabato laid out explicit ground rules for
``private life subject to publication and broadcast.'' He concluded
that only sexual activity that ``is compulsive or manifestly
indiscreet'' or suggests ``a clear intersection between an
official's public and private roles'' should be fair game for media
scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   That would sure seem to cover Clinton's behavior. But Sabato
warned the president's vocal critics could have their bedsheets
examined under what he labels the ``hypocrisy'' standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hypocrisy factor is critical,'' he said. `I don't think
any old legislator who had an affair 15 years ago will necessarily
have to fear being exposed. But obviously the people who take a
leadership role (in attacking Clinton's behavior) have more to
fear.''
</P>

   Can you guess the one outlet that didn't carry major coverage of
the Sept. 2 crash of Swissair Flight 111? CNN's Airport Network,
which serves passengers at more than 30 US airports. Although the
network touts its ability to air the ``latest'' updates including
``live, breaking news direct from CNN,'' it treads very lightly on
news of air disasters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Airport Network will offer no graphic coverage of a crash for
obvious reasons,'' said spokeswoman Jennifer Rankin. After a
two-hour delay, Rankin added, the network will air a brief item on
a crash, but won't ``go into great specifics.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   ``Civic journalism'' _the controversial movement that utilizes
focus groups and coffee klatches to connect journalists to their
communities _ is a four-letter word in some media circles. Maybe
that's why in a Wall Street Journal story earlier this year,
Baltimore Sun editor John Carroll was quoted as saying his paper's
``Reading by 9'' project is not ``civic journalism.'' (The project
is designed to improve student reading skills through everything
from news coverage to Sun volunteer tutors.)
</P>
<P>
   Carroll's comment came as a bit of a shock to Jan Schaffer,
executive director of the Pew Center for Civic Journalism, who read
it the morning after the Pew board voted to hand out the center's
annual $25,000 Batten Award for Excellence in Civic Journalism. As
fate would have it, one of the three 1998 winners turned out to be
the ``Reading by 9'' effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think John expressed some embarassment to me,'' said
Schaffer.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Carroll now says, ``I kind of regret having said
that'' in the Journal story. ``I had some questions about civic
journalism as I read and heard about it early on. ... I've always
taken a position that you can call it anything you want to.'' And
you can probably call the Sun a convert to civic journalism.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Journalists often defend the use of anonymous sources as the
only way to get important stories into play. In its October issue,
Steven Brill's Content magazine awarded a year's subscription to
the reader who found the most references to those mysterious
``sources'' in one story.
</P>
<P>
   The winner: a May 3 Los Angeles Times piece that had 14
``sources say'' citings in 1,025 words. What vital information was
conveyed in that story? The price of real estate changing hands
among Hollywood celebs.

 &HT;    ........................................................
 &HT;    When Kenneth Starr was chosen to investigate Whitewater in 1994,
the White House counsel, Abner Mikva, assured the Clintons that
this was a fine selection.
 &HT;    Mikva and Starr had known each other for years. During the
1980s, the two men served together on the Federal Appeals Court in
Washington, and though they were on opposite ends of the political
spectrum, the liberal Mikva and the conservative Starr were
friends.
 &HT;    Mikva and Starr socialized at each other's homes, dined out
together with their wives. When Mikva thought of Starr, words such
as ``ethical,'' ``fair,'' ``decent'' came to mind.
 &HT;    If Mikva saw a fault in the younger judge, it was that Starr was
a little too much of an egghead, too pedantic, just not
street-smart. This was brought home to Mikva one day during a near
fistfight at the federal courthouse. Starr, Mikva and Laurence
Silberman were on a three-judge panel and, when they retired to the
conference room, it turned out that Silberman was furious with
Mikva over the case they had just heard.
 &HT;    ``Silberman said to me, 'If you were 10 years younger, I'd punch
you out!' ``Mikva recalls. ``I look over, and there was Ken,
looking at the ceiling, wishing he was not there. He never said a
word. I attributed it to the gentle son of a minister who didn't
like controversy.''
 &HT;    And so, in August 1994, Mikva assured the Clintons: ``Ken and I
had good relations on the court and I'm sure it will continue.''
 &HT;    Twice during 1995, Starr wanted to question both the president
and the first lady in connection with the Arkansas inquiries, and
each time arranged it with Mikva.
 &HT;    ``The milieu could not have been more pleasant or cooperative,''
Mikva says. ``Upstairs in the White House residence, both times on
a Saturday. He arrived discreetly through the back entrance. He
later issued a short statement. There was no commenting or leaking
to the press.''
 &HT;    Mikva walked Starr out after one session and thanked him. ``I
said: 'I realize it was not done for this president. I appreciate
your concern for the presidency.' He said: 'I would not have it any
other way. The Republicans will elect a president again and I want
the presidency to be there.'''
 &HT;    Starr was considered too bland in those days to have political
enemies, and if he did, they would probably have been conservative
Republicans. In 1981, as an aide to Attorney General William French
Smith, Starr shepherded Sandra Day O'Connor's Supreme Court
nomination through the Senate and was attacked by conservatives for
having covered up O'Connor's pro-choice views.
 &HT;    After President Bush appointed him solicitor general in 1989,
Starr showed his independence on his first controversial case,
defying the president by siding with a group of whistle-blowers
against defense contractors.
 &HT;    Even after Starr took a million-dollar-a-year corporate law job
at Kirkland &AMP; Ellis in 1993, he was viewed by the Washington
establishment as the perfect man for handling delicate public
matters. When the congressional committee investigating
sexual-harassment charges against Sen. Bob Packwood needed someone
to review the most intimate secrets in Packwood's diaries, Starr
was hired.
 &HT;    His law partners watched him rushing about, installing a lock on
his door, setting aside a special table as the only place the
diaries could be reviewed and declaring that only the office
administrator could carry the diaries in and out of a special
vault.
 &HT;    In October 1995, Mikva left the White House, still on good terms
with Starr. But what happened a few months later radically changed
Mikva's feelings and embarrassed him in front of the Clintons, who
were by then referring to the independent counsel as ``your friend
Ken Starr.''
 &HT;    ``I was shocked when Mrs. Clinton was called before the grand
jury and he made her go to the courthouse,'' Mikva says. ``He could
have taken her testimony under oath at the White House. He knew
there was no back stairway at that courthouse, that she'd have to
walk right in front of the barrage of cameras. Ken knew that
courthouse better than anyone.
 &HT;    ``When he and I were on the bench there in the 1980s, there was
a U.S. attorney, Jay Stephens, who constantly used the press _ he'd
call press conferences in front of the courthouse to announce an
indictment and then haul in the defendant in front of the cameras.
Ken and I used to stand together at an upstairs window looking
down. We agreed that using the press as a prosecutorial tool was
not something an ethical prosecutor did.
 &HT;    ``The Judge Starr I knew was cautious, deliberate, careful, not
zealous and reckless. The Ken Starr I see now is not the Ken Starr
I knew.''
 &HT;    Is it true? Is there really a new Ken Starr? Rusty Hardin thinks
so too, although he draws a very different conclusion. Hardin, a
lawyer in the independent counsel's office at the start of the
Whitewater investigation, says that Starr needed to learn to think
like a prosecutor. He had never been one, had never even been a
trial lawyer, had spent his career in the high-altitude world of
appellate law.
 &HT;    ``Appellate lawyers don't stand up before the Court of Appeals
and call each other (expletive) _ they don't question each other's
motives,'' Hardin says. ``Prosecutors live with that.''
 &HT;    The reserved Starr drove his assistant prosecutors mad,
endlessly weighing and deliberating every matter. ``Starr was more
concerned with what people thought of him,'' Hardin says. ``But the
more the White House stonewalled, the more he hunkered down.''
 &HT;    Over time, his assistants began to glimpse a new fire in
Prosecutor Starr. Frustrated by Gov. Jim Guy Tucker of Arkansas's
legal challenges to the independent counsel's jurisdiction, Starr
argued the appeal himself. The moment that decision came down from
the Eighth Circuit, Eric Jaso, an assistant in Little Rock,
informed Starr that they had won on every point.
 &HT;    ``Ken let out a yell,'' Jaso recalls. ``He yelled, 'Total and
complete victory!' I wrote it on my screen saver _ 'Total and
Complete Victory!' Ken said, 'This is fantastic!' He was excited,
breathless with exhilaration.''
 &HT;    What drives Starr onward? Who is this minister's son in such
relentless pursuit that he forced the president to admit his sins
on national television?
 &HT;    Very soon, this man the public knows so little about will
command the nation's undivided attention. After spending more than
four years and an estimated $40 million investigating Whitewater,
Filegate, Travelgate, Vincent Foster's death and the Lewinsky
matter, Starr is expected to deliver his final report to Congress
in the coming weeks.
 &HT;    For the first time, the public will get Starr's full view of the
president's wrongdoing; the report will also tell us a good deal
about its author and about the quality and scope of the
investigation. Then we will all have to decide: Should the matter
have been dropped long ago? Did Starr lose all sense of proportion?
Or does he make the case for a criminal cover-up worthy of
impeachment?
 &HT;    For his part, Starr is not talking, and has never talked much
publicly about himself. He has granted few on-the-record interviews
in the last four years to reporters writing profiles of him and has
refused repeated requests over a four-month period to be
interviewed for this article.
 &HT;    The only on-the-record interview he has done on any subject
recently _ conducted in April by Steven Brill for his media
magazine, Brill's Content _ landed Starr in trouble with a federal
judge over leaking information to the press about the
investigation. And so, morning after morning, TV crews camp out in
front of his McLean, Va., home at dawn, shooting fresh video of the
man walking to his car with his Starbucks coffee, trying to prod
him into a sound bite.
 &HT;    Nor was Starr willing to permit an interview with his wife,
Alice, although she made the single-most-telling comment about what
their lives are like these days, during an hourlong profile of
Starr shown by the A&AMP;E network in June. ``Sometimes,'' Alice Starr
said, ``it seems like a nightmare that won't ever go away, and I
always think to myself, `It can't get worse than this.' And it
does. Every day it seems to get worse and worse.''
 &HT;    Of course, it didn't have to go on this long. A different
independent counsel might have ended things a lot sooner. In 1987,
James McKay, a Democrat, began investigating Attorney General Edwin
Meese III, a Republican. After a year, McKay concluded that Meese
had broken the law by accepting favors from a defense contractor
and could be convicted by a jury.
 &HT;    Meese's behavior was so troubling that two of his top aides at
the Justice Department, William Weld and Arnold Burns, fellow
Republicans, resigned in protest. But that independent counsel
decided against taking the case to trial; McKay thought the scope
of Meese's wrongdoing was not worth the political trauma that would
be caused by putting the nation's top law-enforcement officer on
trial.
 &HT;    McKay says he feels the same way about the Lewinsky matter, that
Starr has gone ``so far afield'': ``We could have gone off on
things with Meese, but I said no. It makes your blood run cold, the
idea of looking into a case about sexual affairs.''

 &HT;    .......................................................
 &HT;    Kenneth Winston Starr was born July 21, 1946, in Vernon, Texas,
the youngest of three children. His father, Willie Douglas Starr, a
fundamentalist minister and a barber, put in long, hard hours to
support the family. From the beginning, religion was central to the
boy's life.
 &HT;    ``He's gone to church ever since he was 2 weeks old and never
known any different,'' says his mother, Vannie, who is 91. ``We
just started him from babyhood to know right from wrong.''
 &HT;    When Kenneth was in fifth grade, the Starrs moved to a white
frame house shaded by ash and pecan trees in a working-class
section of San Antonio, where Vannie Starr still lives.
 &HT;    Starr's friends from his teen-age days remember him as bright,
bookish, religious, a little nerdy, totally unathletic but popular,
mature and focused beyond his years. Sam Millsap, who went to
junior high with Starr, lived nearby and, like Starr, was raised in
the Church of Christ. There was no drinking, smoking, dancing, no
musical instruments in church, but a lot of Bible verse.
 &HT;    ``If it was fun, you couldn't do it,'' Millsap says. ``We were
told _ Sunday morning, Sunday night, Wednesday night _ almost
everything fun was wrong and we were going to hell because we were
sinners.'' Millsap, who went on to become the district attorney of
San Antonio, says, ``When I got older I switched to the Methodist
Church so I'd have a shot at heaven.'' Starr attends an evangelical
Bible church.
 &HT;    ``In retrospect,'' Millsap says, ``as I piece together Starr,
the thing at the core of everything is his church faith. Ken was
always independent and sure of himself, his ability and his beliefs
of what's right and what's wrong. He was following his own light _
he didn't give a hoot about the group. When we were in church as
kids, we knew we were out of step with the mainstream, because we
believed what others didn't and we understood we could be subject
to persecution _ it was part of the yoke that made us special.''
 &HT;    The other thing that school friends such as Gary O. Smith
remember was Starr's passion for politics. At Sam Houston High,
besides being a member of the drama club and the yearbook and
newspaper staffs, Starr was president of the junior and senior
classes. As a ninth grader in 1960, he passed out campaign
literature for Richard Nixon; as a senior, for Barry Goldwater.
After graduating, he spent two years at Harding College, a Church
of Christ school in Arkansas, selling Bibles door to door to help
pay his tuition.
 &HT;    But if there is one thing that has struck people who have known
Starr well, both in Texas and Washington, it is his ability to
grow. He wanted an Eastern education. He wanted to see how he
stacked up against different people. He wanted to see how far he
could go.
 &HT;    For his junior year, he transferred to George Washington
University. He did stick out a little there; while classmates were
protesting the Vietnam War in tie-dyed shirts, Starr wore a tie to
lectures. But like most of his classmates, he did not go to
Vietnam, classified 4-F thanks to a case of psoriasis.
 &HT;    The summer he graduated, he met Alice Mendell, a Jewish girl
from Mamaroneck, N.Y., and Skidmore College. They were wed by a
Church of Christ minister and have been married 28 years. It was
Alice, friends say, who taught the minister's son to dance.
 &HT;    After getting a law degree at Duke, Starr was selected in the
mid-1970s for a clerkship with Chief Justice Warren Burger. It was
the first of many times he would advance his career by ably serving
an older, conservative Republican.
 &HT;    In 1982, when Starr was Attorney General William French Smith's
chief of staff, a profile in American Lawyer magazine described the
35-year-old Starr as the perfect assistant, ``deferential without
being obsequious, intelligent without being intimidating ...
anything but one of those arrogant aides who strut the corridors of
Washington.''
 &HT;    Indeed, Jacob Stein, one of Monica Lewinsky's lawyers, noticed
some of those same traits during his negotiations with Starr over
which sexual acts his client might testify to. ``Ken Starr has the
manners of a Southern gentleman,'' says the 73-year-old Stein,
``beautiful manners.''
 &HT;    He is also a workaholic of mythic proportions, even by
Washington standards. ``Ken's smart, but he's not a genius,'' says
Tex Lezar, a former colleague in the Reagan Justice Department.
``He's not this person with a 195 IQ. He got where he is by working
very, very hard.''
 &HT;    Henry Habicht, another Reagan-era colleague, remembers that at
the Justice Department in the early '80s he would be in Starr's
office at 8:30 p.m. discussing an issue as Starr changed into a
tuxedo for a black-tie event. ``He'd come back to the office after
the affair,'' Habicht says, ``pick up work to take home, then be in
at 7 the next day.''
 &HT;    Often Starr had to learn as he went. He became an Appeals Court
judge in 1983, though he had never been a lower court judge; the
solicitor general _ the government's lawyer to the Supreme Court _
in 1989, though he had never argued before the Supreme Court; the
independent counsel in 1994, though he had never been a prosecutor.
 &HT;    An interviewer once asked Alice Starr what she and her husband
did for fun and she said that on Sundays they took car rides in the
country: She drove while he read.
 &HT;    He has put in the same endless hours juggling the independent
counsel's job with private practice. Starr was so busy flying
around the country for those two jobs, plus making speeches and
teaching a course at New York University, that when John Bates, a
deputy prosecutor from 1995 to 1997, wanted to discuss the Clinton
investigation, he sometimes had to ride with Starr in a taxi to the
airport.
 &HT;    Most profiles have portrayed Starr as a career man who still
manages to coach his daughter's softball team and teach Sunday
school, although friends say it has been years since he has been
able to do those things. ``He's a good father for a workaholic,''
one friend says.
 &HT;    It is Alice who is ``so brilliant about organizing their lives
so he has family time,'' Bates says. At an ABA breakfast appearance
in August, as Starr shook every hand in sight, Alice slipped off,
filled a plate with food, quietly set it on the table in front of
his chair, then went back to get him juice. She is also an
executive in a real-estate firm.
 &HT;    While McLean is an upscale suburb, the Starrs live in the same
four-bedroom brick-and-frame house they bought 21 years ago when he
was a young lawyer, a comfortable home but not lavish. They are
known as gracious hosts.
 &HT;    In his most recent financial-disclosure statement, filed for
1996, Starr lists a salary of $1.14 million and assets of $3.8
million to $7.9 million. (Federal forms are vague, requiring that
assets be listed as a range, and it is possible that his worth is
higher, since one trust is in the top category of ``over $1
million.'')
 &HT;    His three children are used to having his work life mixed into
their family time. When Eric Jaso applied for a job as a prosecutor
in Starr's office three years ago, Starr suggested that they meet
for an interview in Princeton, where Jaso was working on a case.
 &HT;    ``I'm waiting in a hotel lobby,'' Jaso remembers, ``and all of a
sudden this man rushes up and says: 'Eric? Ken Starr. Sorry I'm
late, but we're in the middle of a tour of the campus. Come join
us.' And we go out front and there's this wood-paneled minivan and
inside are his two daughters, his son'' _ the prospective freshman
_ ``his wife, plus two Princeton undergrads conducting the tour,
and he says, 'Hop in,' and I sit in the back near his littlest
daughter.''
 &HT;    Jaso took the walking tour of the Princeton campus with the
entire Starr family. ``He and I hung back so he could interview
me,'' Jaso says. ''And then all of us went to lunch.''
 &HT;    Two years ago, Starr's wife gave him a 50th birthday party, and
one of the speakers roasting him was their son, Randall, the oldest
child, who recalled how his father tortured them on family trips by
playing tapes of famous historical speeches.
 &HT;    Habicht remembers Starr testing Carolyn, the middle child, when
she was 5 or 6 to see if she could name the presidents in order.
Today, Randall is an undergraduate at Duke and Carolyn is beginning
her freshman year at Stanford, a year behind Chelsea Clinton.
 &HT;    Even as a young man, Starr ``carried himself very much in a
judicial manner,'' says Bob McConnell, another lawyer in the Reagan
Justice Department. ``I kidded him. He was always trying to be
thoughtful, deliberate.''
 &HT;    All along, friends say, it was perfectly clear Starr didn't want
to be just a Supreme Court justice; he wanted to be chief justice.
 &HT;    In January 1989, President Bush asked Starr to be solicitor
general. It was an honor _ and, for someone whose goal was to be on
the Supreme Court, a political minefield. For days, he spent long
stretches in his office, door closed, on the phone to friends. ``He
was very conflicted,'' Lezar recalls.
 &HT;    Starr had watched Reagan's first solicitor general, Rex Lee,
attacked from the right for not being aggressive enough in
challenging Roe vs. Wade and from the left for being too
aggressive.
 &HT;    ``Ken recognized if he took it, there was a good chance he'd
never get back to the appellate bench, never make it to the Supreme
Court because he'd make too many political enemies,'' Lezar says.
``But he understood that reaching the Supreme Court is kind of like
lightning striking, it's out of your control.''
 &HT;    Starr was trapped. If he said no, he risked alienating the very
president who would select the next justice. But in taking the job,
Lezar says, Starr still hoped the call would come someday. ``I
don't think he ever completely gave it up. It's like a senator who
wants to be president. At some point, time passes you by and you
know intellectually that it won't happen, but in your heart you
don't give up.''
 &HT;    A good solicitor general strikes a delicate balance, primarily
arguing the agenda of the president who nominated him but, when the
law demands, saying no to the president. Starr's predecessor as
solicitor general, Charles Fried, is widely regarded as having been
too much a political lackey of the Reagan administration; Starr is
credited with restoring a proper balance.
 &HT;    On his first tough case, a request from the White House to write
an amicus brief for military contractors in a dispute with
whistle-blowers, Starr sided with the whistle-blowers and against
Bush.
 &HT;    ``He held endless meetings with all the parties involved,'' says
Thomas Merrill, one of Starr's former deputies. ``Starr sat there
like a judge, hearing everyone out, very courtly _ if anything,
excessively judicious. I kept wishing he'd throw everyone out of
his office and decide. He took so long making up his mind to do the
right thing _ but he did.''
 &HT;    Starr argued several cases involving moral issues _ including a
Bush administration challenge to Roe vs. Wade _ but, his deputies
say, he did not discuss his religious or moral views. Prosecutors
in the independent counsel's office say the same. Although he sings
hymns on his morning jog and keeps a calendar with daily Scripture
verses at his private residence, he did not bring his religion into
the workplace, they say.
 &HT;    The main criticism of Starr as solicitor general was also
expressed later at the independent counsel's office: He was
involved in too many outside activities, spread too thin,
constantly touring the country, advancing his name in legal
circles.
 &HT;    Merrill says that Starr could be gone a couple of days a week,
``off delivering some ridiculous speech to a bar association in
Tucson.'' He would send back legal briefs for his deputies, full of
little yellow stickers they called Ken-grams.
 &HT;    ``I questioned these road shows,'' Merrill says. ``He'd make
some dry legal speech and then go around the room meeting and
greeting as many lawyers as he could. I don't know why he bothered
_ maybe he felt like he was building a base for the Supreme
Court.'' Starr's assistants could tell that possibility was never
too far out of his mind. If they were working a controversial case,
he'd joke, ``This will do me in for the Supreme Court for sure.''
 &HT;    In July 1990, Justice William Brennan announced his retirement.
Press reports said that Starr was on the short list of nominees.
But by then, as he feared, he had alienated too many
constituencies. The Bush White House was upset about the
whistle-blower case. Senate liberals felt he had been too
aggressive arguing a challenge to Roe vs. Wade.
 &HT;    Robert Shapiro, a deputy solicitor general, was with Starr in
his office when they heard the news. ``The announcement that it was
Souter came on TV over CNN,'' Shapiro says. ``I looked at his face
for signs of disappointment. We all knew how he felt. There was
nothing. Nothing. Not a single indication of any emotion. Not
one.''

 &HT;     (NOTE: Editors _ This is Part II in a four-part series.)
 &HT;    .......................................................
 &HT;    Kenneth Winston Starr was born July 21, 1946, in Vernon, Texas,
the youngest of three children. His father, Willie Douglas Starr, a
fundamentalist minister and a barber, put in long, hard hours to
support the family. From the beginning, religion was central to the
boy's life.
 &HT;    ``He's gone to church ever since he was 2 weeks old and never
known any different,'' says his mother, Vannie, who is 91. ``We
just started him from babyhood to know right from wrong.''
 &HT;    When Kenneth was in fifth grade, the Starrs moved to a white
frame house shaded by ash and pecan trees in a working-class
section of San Antonio, where Vannie Starr still lives.
 &HT;    Starr's friends from his teen-age days remember him as bright,
bookish, religious, a little nerdy, totally unathletic but popular,
mature and focused beyond his years. Sam Millsap, who went to
junior high with Starr, lived nearby and, like Starr, was raised in
the Church of Christ. There was no drinking, smoking, dancing, no
musical instruments in church, but a lot of Bible verse.
 &HT;    ``If it was fun, you couldn't do it,'' Millsap says. ``We were
told _ Sunday morning, Sunday night, Wednesday night _ almost
everything fun was wrong and we were going to hell because we were
sinners.'' Millsap, who went on to become the district attorney of
San Antonio, says, ``When I got older I switched to the Methodist
Church so I'd have a shot at heaven.'' Starr attends an evangelical
Bible church.
 &HT;    ``In retrospect,'' Millsap says, ``as I piece together Starr,
the thing at the core of everything is his church faith. Ken was
always independent and sure of himself, his ability and his beliefs
of what's right and what's wrong. He was following his own light _
he didn't give a hoot about the group. When we were in church as
kids, we knew we were out of step with the mainstream, because we
believed what others didn't and we understood we could be subject
to persecution _ it was part of the yoke that made us special.''
 &HT;    The other thing that school friends such as Gary O. Smith
remember was Starr's passion for politics. At Sam Houston High,
besides being a member of the drama club and the yearbook and
newspaper staffs, Starr was president of the junior and senior
classes. As a ninth grader in 1960, he passed out campaign
literature for Richard Nixon; as a senior, for Barry Goldwater.
After graduating, he spent two years at Harding College, a Church
of Christ school in Arkansas, selling Bibles door to door to help
pay his tuition.
 &HT;    But if there is one thing that has struck people who have known
Starr well, both in Texas and Washington, it is his ability to
grow. He wanted an Eastern education. He wanted to see how he
stacked up against different people. He wanted to see how far he
could go.
 &HT;    For his junior year, he transferred to George Washington
University. He did stick out a little there; while classmates were
protesting the Vietnam War in tie-dyed shirts, Starr wore a tie to
lectures. But like most of his classmates, he did not go to
Vietnam, classified 4-F thanks to a case of psoriasis.
 &HT;    The summer he graduated, he met Alice Mendell, a Jewish girl
from Mamaroneck, N.Y., and Skidmore College. They were wed by a
Church of Christ minister and have been married 28 years. It was
Alice, friends say, who taught the minister's son to dance.
 &HT;    After getting a law degree at Duke, Starr was selected in the
mid-1970s for a clerkship with Chief Justice Warren Burger. It was
the first of many times he would advance his career by ably serving
an older, conservative Republican.
 &HT;    In 1982, when Starr was Attorney General William French Smith's
chief of staff, a profile in American Lawyer magazine described the
35-year-old Starr as the perfect assistant, ``deferential without
being obsequious, intelligent without being intimidating ...
anything but one of those arrogant aides who strut the corridors of
Washington.''
 &HT;    Indeed, Jacob Stein, one of Monica Lewinsky's lawyers, noticed
some of those same traits during his negotiations with Starr over
which sexual acts his client might testify to. ``Ken Starr has the
manners of a Southern gentleman,'' says the 73-year-old Stein,
``beautiful manners.''
 &HT;    He is also a workaholic of mythic proportions, even by
Washington standards. ``Ken's smart, but he's not a genius,'' says
Tex Lezar, a former colleague in the Reagan Justice Department.
``He's not this person with a 195 IQ. He got where he is by working
very, very hard.''
 &HT;    Henry Habicht, another Reagan-era colleague, remembers that at
the Justice Department in the early '80s he would be in Starr's
office at 8:30 p.m. discussing an issue as Starr changed into a
tuxedo for a black-tie event. ``He'd come back to the office after
the affair,'' Habicht says, ``pick up work to take home, then be in
at 7 the next day.''
 &HT;    Often Starr had to learn as he went. He became an Appeals Court
judge in 1983, though he had never been a lower court judge; the
solicitor general _ the government's lawyer to the Supreme Court _
in 1989, though he had never argued before the Supreme Court; the
independent counsel in 1994, though he had never been a prosecutor.
 &HT;    An interviewer once asked Alice Starr what she and her husband
did for fun and she said that on Sundays they took car rides in the
country: She drove while he read.
 &HT;    He has put in the same endless hours juggling the independent
counsel's job with private practice. Starr was so busy flying
around the country for those two jobs, plus making speeches and
teaching a course at New York University, that when John Bates, a
deputy prosecutor from 1995 to 1997, wanted to discuss the Clinton
investigation, he sometimes had to ride with Starr in a taxi to the
airport.
 &HT;    Most profiles have portrayed Starr as a career man who still
manages to coach his daughter's softball team and teach Sunday
school, although friends say it has been years since he has been
able to do those things. ``He's a good father for a workaholic,''
one friend says.
 &HT;    It is Alice who is ``so brilliant about organizing their lives
so he has family time,'' Bates says. At an ABA breakfast appearance
in August, as Starr shook every hand in sight, Alice slipped off,
filled a plate with food, quietly set it on the table in front of
his chair, then went back to get him juice. She is also an
executive in a real-estate firm.
 &HT;    While McLean is an upscale suburb, the Starrs live in the same
four-bedroom brick-and-frame house they bought 21 years ago when he
was a young lawyer, a comfortable home but not lavish. They are
known as gracious hosts.
 &HT;    In his most recent financial-disclosure statement, filed for
1996, Starr lists a salary of $1.14 million and assets of $3.8
million to $7.9 million. (Federal forms are vague, requiring that
assets be listed as a range, and it is possible that his worth is
higher, since one trust is in the top category of ``over $1
million.'')
 &HT;    His three children are used to having his work life mixed into
their family time. When Eric Jaso applied for a job as a prosecutor
in Starr's office three years ago, Starr suggested that they meet
for an interview in Princeton, where Jaso was working on a case.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 NOTE: Full-length article (8,700 words) available on request  
 &HT;     (NOTE: Editors: this is Part III in a four-part series.) 
 &HT;    .......................................................
 &HT;    Everyone has a theory on Kenneth Starr. After the Monica
Lewinsky story broke, Hillary Clinton called Starr ``a politically
motivated prosecutor who is allied with the right-wing opponents of
my husband.''
 &HT;    Harold Ickes, the former deputy White House chief of staff, says
he sees Starr as a dangerous moralist who views the Clintons ``like
Sodom and Gomorrah and is hellbent on running them out of
Washington.''
 &HT;    Who is Starr that he sees his mission so differently from
earlier independent prosecutors?
 &HT;    In hopes of any insight, I followed him to Toronto in early
August for the speech he delivers every year at the American Bar
Association convention reviewing recent Supreme Court decisions.
 &HT;    He spoke on ``the new textualism.'' Reporters' pens barely
moved. Still, hungry people will take what crumbs they can, and
afterward a dean of a major law school told me that it was a
blatantly political speech, an effort to butter up the Supreme
Court, particularly the Democrat-appointed justices, so they would
be happy to see Starr the next time he argued before them.
 &HT;    ``Did you see all the nice things he said about Breyer and
Ginsburg?'' the dean asked.
 &HT;    Had I missed it? Was Starr sending coded messages to Supreme
Court justices via C-Span 2? Who knew? In time, I learned that
tracking Starr was like following Chauncey Gardiner around in
``Being There'' _ you could read into him almost whatever you
wanted.
 &HT;    I pored over Starr's past speeches but found they offered little
insight into the human being behind the ideas. At Duke University's
1995 commencement, he talked about ``accountability''; at a 1996
meeting of the Economics Club of Detroit, he spoke of ``civic
virtue.'' (He was in favor of both.)
 &HT;    In May at a Charlotte, N.C., bar association meeting, he urged
lawyers to take ``the moral high ground of Atticus Finch,'' the
brave country lawyer in ``To Kill a Mockingbird,'' Harper Lee's
novel, ``who strove to find the truth while defending a black man
wrongly accused.''
 &HT;    In terms of content, the speech was one of Starr's best,
discussing the balance a lawyer must maintain between defending a
client and serving the truth.
 &HT;    But in tone, it was a disaster and widely ridiculed. Starr, the
million-dollar corporate lawyer who represents tobacco companies,
was urging his fellow lawyers to be more like Atticus Finch? Didn't
he know what this would sound like? How much perspective on Ken
Starr did Ken Starr have?
 &HT;    Mostly what Starr talks about these days in his rare public
moments is his search for truth. In the Atticus Finch speech, he
used the word ``truth'' 25 times. In his TV sound bites, he comes
across as some Old World prophet, but instead of wandering the
desert he is rushing in and out of courthouses, hurrying up and
down his driveway.
 &HT;    ``Our job is to get at the truth, and the truth will speak for
itself,'' he says. Or, ``My commitment is to the people and to the
pursuit of the truth.'' Or, in his most famous variation, analyzed
and reanalyzed for its religious overtones: ``There's no room for
white lies. There's no room for shading. You cannot defile the
temple of justice.''
 &HT;    He has also compared himself to Sgt. Joe Friday. (ital.) Just
the facts, ma'am. (end ital.) Frequently, his spokesman, Charles
Bakaly III, warns reporters, ``We're the only ones who have all the
facts.''
 &HT;    But in Washington, other perceptions of Starr also persist. If
you say ``tin ear,'' people instantly understand that you're
talking ``Ken Starr'' and his lapses of political common sense.
This tin ear is partly a matter of being more book smart than
streetwise. In 1989, after his confirmation hearing to be solicitor
general in the Bush administration, Starr called Bob McConnell, a
friend who'd worked with him in the Reagan Justice Department in
the early '80s, to ask how he had come across.
 &HT;    ``I said, 'Everything's going to be fine,''' remembers
McConnell, who was impressed. ``Ken said: 'Really? I watched myself
on CNN and I must tell you, I thought I sounded pedantic.'''
 &HT;    ``Ken, you ARE pedantic,'' McConnell said.
 &HT;    ``I am?''
 &HT;    ``Of course you are,'' McConnell said.
 &HT;    While solicitor general, Starr organized a half-day seminar in
the Justice Department's Great Hall commemorating the 100th
anniversary of William Howard Taft's appointment as solicitor
general. Starr was quite excited, had programs printed, arranged
for several speeches in praise of Taft, contacted Taft family
members.
 &HT;    ``Among the lawyers on the staff, this was a subject of immense
lunchroom talk,'' says Thomas Merrill, one of Starr's former
deputies. To some it seemed a too-obvious sign of his ambition:
Starr paying homage to the former solicitor general who went on to
be president and then chief justice of the Supreme Court. To others
it just seemed goofy: William Howard Taft Day?
 &HT;    In short, Starr has never had a great sense of how he appears to
others. It has been one of the harshest criticisms of him as
independent counsel. Rather than acting as an (ital)independent(end
ital) counsel, he has repeatedly entangled himself with
anti-Clinton forces, making himself appear highly partisan.
 &HT;    One example among many: Starr's public appearance a month before
the 1996 presidential election with Pat Robertson, the
Christian-right leader and vicious Clinton critic, at a celebration
of the 10th anniversary of the founding of Robertson's law school.
 &HT;    Why didn't Starr see his own potential conflicts of interest?
His assistant prosecutors did. Several told me they wish that when
he became independent counsel he had taken a leave from his law
firm and from representing clients such as tobacco companies, which
had a stake in seeing the president weakened politically. But
Starr's aides didn't tell him this. ``He doesn't take criticism of
his motives well,'' one colleague says.
 &HT;    Friends say Starr is so sure he's a fair person, and works such
backbreaking hours to come to the right answers, that he can't
conceive of people questioning his ethics. ``He expects everyone to
apply a legal standard to things,'' says Thomas Yannucci, a senior
partner at Kirkland &AMP; Ellis, where Starr began working in 1993.
 &HT;    For Starr, the fact that his speech at Pat Robertson's law
school had nothing to do with the investigation was the crucial
point, not the appearance of his honoring Robertson the
Clinton-hater. (Indeed, Starr's speech, on the future of the
judiciary, was so dull and academic that reporters had trouble
finding a usable quote.)
 &HT;    ``He thinks, `Why should he be deprived of the right to speak at
Pat Robertson's university?''' Yannucci says. ``He sees it like a
First Amendment issue. He thinks, 'I speak at all kinds of places.'
And intellectually what he thinks is correct, but politically it
does not always wash.''
 &HT;    But even Starr's best friends were caught off guard when he took
the independent counsel's job in 1994 and are not sure why he
wanted it. In 1981, as an aide to Attorney General William French
Smith, Starr had been united with his young colleagues in their
disdain for the independent counsel's law. Starr helped prepare a
legal brief arguing that it was unconstitutional, placing too much
unchecked power in one person.
 &HT;    ``When I heard Ken had taken the job,'' McConnell says, ``I sent
him a note: 'I guess if someone has to do an unconstitutional deed,
it has to be you.'''
 &HT;    Starr's other friends from the Reagan Justice Department had
different theories on why he accepted. Theodore Olson, who is now a
prominent Washington lawyer, saw it as a personality thing: ``Ken
has a hard time saying no to people.'' Henry Habicht thought
religion was a factor: ``Reading between the lines, I think Ken
believed that since God had put him in all these lofty posts, he
had a duty to use his experience when a public-service challenge
arose.''
 &HT;    Still others saw Starr's choice as a career decision by a man
who had lost some of his taste for corporate law. Some say he
wanted to be back in the public spotlight. Anyone who has seen
Starr work a room would swear he's running for something.
 &HT;    At the ABA convention in Toronto, he attended a prayer breakfast
in addition to delivering his speech, and at each event he roved
the banquet hall, shaking hundreds of hands, hugging women, signing
autographs, posing for photos.
 &HT;    ``He's really eating this up, isn't he?'' one ABA staff member
said. After Elizabeth Dole's speech at the prayer breakfast,
several people came up to Starr and said, ``God bless you _ keep up
the good work.''
 &HT;    There is probably some truth in a variety of motivations _ that
Starr had no love for Clinton, felt a civic and religious duty, was
bored in his law job, wanted more attention, had trouble saying no.
Yet no single explanation seems sufficient. If he was part of a
vast right-wing conspiracy devoted to nailing the president, why
did he try to leave the independent counsel's job in 1997 to be a
dean at Pepperdine University?
 &HT;    Rusty Hardin, a prosecutor in the independent counsel's office
at the start of the Whitewater investigation, says that in 1994,
Starr did not have a clue what he was taking on.
 &HT;    ``He thought he could parachute in, do it in a year or two, not
consume his whole life and get out. He misjudged. He'd never been
in the national spotlight. He still thought like an appellate
lawyer _ that cases would be decided on their merits.''

 By MICHAEL WINERIP  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 NOTE: Full-length article (8,700 words) available on request  
 &HT;     (NOTE: Editors: this is Part III in a four-part series.) 
 &HT;    .......................................................
 &HT;    Everyone has a theory on Kenneth Starr. After the Monica
Lewinsky story broke, Hillary Clinton called Starr ``a politically
motivated prosecutor who is allied with the right-wing opponents of
my husband.''
 &HT;    Harold Ickes, the former deputy White House chief of staff, says
he sees Starr as a dangerous moralist who views the Clintons ``like
Sodom and Gomorrah and is hellbent on running them out of
Washington.''
 &HT;    Who is Starr that he sees his mission so differently from
earlier independent prosecutors?
 &HT;    In hopes of any insight, I followed him to Toronto in early
August for the speech he delivers every year at the American Bar
Association convention reviewing recent Supreme Court decisions.
 &HT;    He spoke on ``the new textualism.'' Reporters' pens barely
moved. Still, hungry people will take what crumbs they can, and
afterward a dean of a major law school told me that it was a
blatantly political speech, an effort to butter up the Supreme
Court, particularly the Democrat-appointed justices, so they would
be happy to see Starr the next time he argued before them.
 &HT;    ``Did you see all the nice things he said about Breyer and
Ginsburg?'' the dean asked.
 &HT;    Had I missed it? Was Starr sending coded messages to Supreme
Court justices via C-Span 2? Who knew? In time, I learned that
tracking Starr was like following Chauncey Gardiner around in
``Being There'' _ you could read into him almost whatever you
wanted.
 &HT;    I pored over Starr's past speeches but found they offered little
insight into the human being behind the ideas. At Duke University's
1995 commencement, he talked about ``accountability''; at a 1996
meeting of the Economics Club of Detroit, he spoke of ``civic
virtue.'' (He was in favor of both.)
 &HT;    In May at a Charlotte, N.C., bar association meeting, he urged
lawyers to take ``the moral high ground of Atticus Finch,'' the
brave country lawyer in ``To Kill a Mockingbird,'' Harper Lee's
novel, ``who strove to find the truth while defending a black man
wrongly accused.''
 &HT;    In terms of content, the speech was one of Starr's best,
discussing the balance a lawyer must maintain between defending a
client and serving the truth.
 &HT;    But in tone, it was a disaster and widely ridiculed. Starr, the
million-dollar corporate lawyer who represents tobacco companies,
was urging his fellow lawyers to be more like Atticus Finch? Didn't
he know what this would sound like? How much perspective on Ken
Starr did Ken Starr have?
 &HT;    Mostly what Starr talks about these days in his rare public
moments is his search for truth. In the Atticus Finch speech, he
used the word ``truth'' 25 times. In his TV sound bites, he comes
across as some Old World prophet, but instead of wandering the
desert he is rushing in and out of courthouses, hurrying up and
down his driveway.
 &HT;    ``Our job is to get at the truth, and the truth will speak for
itself,'' he says. Or, ``My commitment is to the people and to the
pursuit of the truth.'' Or, in his most famous variation, analyzed
and reanalyzed for its religious overtones: ``There's no room for
white lies. There's no room for shading. You cannot defile the
temple of justice.''
 &HT;    He has also compared himself to Sgt. Joe Friday. (ital.) Just
the facts, ma'am. (end ital.) Frequently, his spokesman, Charles
Bakaly III, warns reporters, ``We're the only ones who have all the
facts.''
 &HT;    But in Washington, other perceptions of Starr also persist. If
you say ``tin ear,'' people instantly understand that you're
talking ``Ken Starr'' and his lapses of political common sense.
This tin ear is partly a matter of being more book smart than
streetwise. In 1989, after his confirmation hearing to be solicitor
general in the Bush administration, Starr called Bob McConnell, a
friend who'd worked with him in the Reagan Justice Department in
the early '80s, to ask how he had come across.
 &HT;    ``I said, 'Everything's going to be fine,''' remembers
McConnell, who was impressed. ``Ken said: 'Really? I watched myself
on CNN and I must tell you, I thought I sounded pedantic.'''
 &HT;    ``Ken, you ARE pedantic,'' McConnell said.
 &HT;    ``I am?''
 &HT;    ``Of course you are,'' McConnell said.
 &HT;    While solicitor general, Starr organized a half-day seminar in
the Justice Department's Great Hall commemorating the 100th
anniversary of William Howard Taft's appointment as solicitor
general. Starr was quite excited, had programs printed, arranged
for several speeches in praise of Taft, contacted Taft family
members.
 &HT;    ``Among the lawyers on the staff, this was a subject of immense
lunchroom talk,'' says Thomas Merrill, one of Starr's former
deputies. To some it seemed a too-obvious sign of his ambition:
Starr paying homage to the former solicitor general who went on to
be president and then chief justice of the Supreme Court. To others
it just seemed goofy: William Howard Taft Day?
 &HT;    In short, Starr has never had a great sense of how he appears to
others. It has been one of the harshest criticisms of him as
independent counsel. Rather than acting as an (ital)independent(end

anti-Clinton forces, making himself appear highly partisan.

the 1996 presidential election with Pat Robertson, the
Christian-right leader and vicious Clinton critic, at a celebration
of the 10th anniversary of the founding of Robertson's law school.

 &HT;    .............................................
 &HT;    Another prosecutor might have formed a different perspective on
an American president who lied about sex in a dismissed civil suit.
 &HT;    Another prosecutor could have ended the Monica Lewinsky inquiry
long ago.
 &HT;    James McKay, the Democratic independent counsel who in 1987
began investigating Republican Attorney General Meese III _ and
opted to avoid the political trauma of a trial for the nation's top
law-enforcement officer _ says that not prosecuting is one of the
hardest decisions a prosecutor makes.
 &HT;    Even within Starr's own office, there was dissent among seasoned
prosecutors over how hard to pursue the Lewinsky investigation. Two
of Starr's assistants, Michael Emmick and Bruce Udolf, argued for
accepting Lewinsky's first proffer in January, then running a swift
investigation and turning a report over to Congress in 60 days.
 &HT;    In typical Starr fashion, these issues were debated endlessly.
Over time, Starr sided with other assistants _ two of his deputies,
Robert Bittman, whom Starr affectionately calls Bulldog, and Jackie
Bennett, known among fellow prosecutors as the office expert on the
president's sex life long before anyone had heard of Lewinsky.
Ultimately, Starr opted for an investigation that would turn up
every last fact.
 &HT;    He fought up to the Supreme Court to get Clinton's Secret
Service guards to testify, up to the Supreme Court trying to get
hold of the notes of the lawyer for the late Vince Foster. Starr
pushed normal prosecutorial practices to the limit by calling
Lewinsky's mother before the grand jury.
 &HT;    It all reflected a big change in Starr. At some point, the
reserved appellate lawyer decided he would do whatever it took
within the limits of the law to squeeze people for his
investigations. He had come to realize that the White House was
going to do what defense lawyers almost always do during criminal
investigations: delay, stall, buy time.
 &HT;    What was the turning point for Starr? His assistant prosecutors
cannot pinpoint it, and who knows if even Starr can. This much is
clear: By the time Lewinsky appeared on the scene, he was poised
for an all-out assault. As to whether he was overzealous and
irresponsible or was simply ``becoming a prosecutor,'' as Rusty
Hardin, his former colleague at the beginning of the Whitewater
investigation believes _ that will depend on what is in his final
report.
 &HT;    What we do know is that Starr was willing to drive on when so
many other prosecutors would have stopped.
 &HT;    Part of the reason is Starr's legal temperament. All his
professional life, before reaching a decision, he has doggedly
pursued every last fact. His friends say it over and over: ``Ken is
determined that no one will defeat him by outworking him.''
 &HT;    As solicitor general in the Bush administration, the first case
he argued before the Supreme Court was an old-fashioned
civil-rights matter left over from the Carter era that forced the
City of Yonkers to remedy past discrimination by racially balancing
its public housing and schools. That couldn't have been a case
Starr had much political sympathy for, and yet his aides remember
his exhaustive preparation.
 &HT;    When he lost, says Robert Shapiro, a former deputy solicitor
general, ``Ken took it very hard.'' He hates to lose.
 &HT;    Starr also has a scholarly, at times pedantic, love for the law
and is genuinely offended that anyone, let alone the president of
the United States, would denigrate it. In his May ``Atticus Finch''
speech at the Charlotte, N.C., bar association, invoking the
beloved character in ``To Kill a Mockingbird,'' Starr warned that
the single biggest problem facing lawyers today is ``loss of
respect for the truth.''
 &HT;    While Starr wants to be liked, he was also raised to have
confidence in his beliefs even if most people don't agree. A detail
such as a 19 percent approval rating in the polls isn't going to
deter Starr.
 &HT;    As for his career, he had little at stake anymore. When he tried
to leave the independent counsel's job in 1997 to be a dean at
Pepperdine University, he changed his mind a few days after the
announcement due to an uproar from the press and his prosecutors;
he couldn't escape. His great dream, the Supreme Court, had long
passed. His next most likely steps _ academia and corporate law _
are assured no matter how this investigation turns out.
 &HT;    Indeed, a senior partner at Kirkland &AMP; Ellis, Thomas Yannucci,
who is close to him, says that Starr, despite taking an unpaid
leave of absence from the firm in July, plans to return when this
is all over. In what may be the understatement of the year,
Yannucci says, ``Now that he's taken on his public duty, I don't
think he has the same view of public service.''
 &HT;    Did Starr come to hate the president _ did that drive him too?
The answer is probably yes, although not at first, and not until he
felt that the White House was stonewalling. I asked John Bates, a
deputy prosecutor from 1995 to 1997, whether Starr hates Clinton.
 &HT;    Bates was quiet a long time and then gave an answer so
convoluted that I stopped taking notes. I asked again, Did Starr
hate Clinton? ``I think Ken is very upset at how personal and
political the attacks on him, the office and others in the office
have become,'' he said.
 &HT;    Did moral outrage at Clinton's sexual escapades also fuel
Starr's investigation? Lawyers who have sat with him at meetings
when these details were discussed say they could tell that Starr
was offended.
 &HT;    But when asked for a single example, a single comment or
outburst, they could not provide one. They answered that it was
subtle, in the wrinkle of an eyebrow or a quiet grimace. They had
heard his deputies make lewd remarks, but not Starr; he was too
professional for that.
 &HT;    We do know that Starr was raised to take a hard line against
such behavior. When his mother was asked for this article what she
wanted Americans to think of her son, she answered, ``I want them
to think of a man who believes in doing right and a man who does
not cheat on his wife, like Clinton has on his wife.''
 &HT;    All this said, in the end Starr's motives no longer matter. That
is his victory, his measure of vindication. It no longer matters if
malicious right-wingers consorted with his office to lay a trap for
the president, if prudishness or ambition or even radio waves from
outer space drove Ken Starr. The president has admitted misleading
the American public. He lied. Through Starr's doggedness, his
relentless effort to amass every last fact, he has succeeded in
making his investigation about Bill Clinton, not about Ken Starr.
 &HT;    All Clinton's life, the man from Hope has relied on his brains,
his charm, his boyishness, his uncanny political instincts, his
superhuman energy to squeeze through tight spots. Not this time.
This time Starr built such a wall of facts that Clinton had no
place to go. On Aug. 17, 1998, at 10 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time,
Clinton hit that wall. It was not a pretty sight.
 &HT;    Which is not to say that Starr has scored his total and complete
victory. This may or may not turn out to be about obstructing
justice, but regardless, it is lots and lots about sex, and no one
wins when such private matters are made public.
 &HT;    All who became embroiled in the Lewinsky case _ the White House,
the press and the prosecutors, too _ dirtied themselves. When Starr
needed someone to show the American public that he was acting
fairly, he hired the Watergate hero Sam Dash as his ethics adviser.
Within Starr's office, Dash is referred to as ``our secret
weapon.''
 &HT;    A generation from now, if there is another president who needs
investigating, will the special prosecutor of that era hire Starr
as his secret weapon? Not likely.
 &HT;    Once Starr drops his report at Congress's door, the nation's
attention will be riveted on Clinton. It'll be (ital)just the
facts(end ital). People laughed at Starr when he once compared
himself to Sgt. Joe Friday, but it turns out he was right, he did
have something in common with the ``Dragnet'' cop.
 &HT;    In making the decision on what should be done with Bill Clinton
_ drop the matter? censure? impeachment? _ some in Congress will
choose along partisan lines, a few will look into their own
personal lives, but most will stick their fingers into the wind and
check the public-opinion polls. The citizenry will decide. Starr
has forced Americans to confront every last prurient fact, right
down to the presidential DNA.
 &HT;    There are those who will say that half the marriages in America
end in divorce, that if every spouse who lied about sex had to
confess on TV, the testimony would fill 500 cable channels for 500
years, that this is a matter between the Clintons and that what
Bill Clinton has already publicly admitted to is more than we would
ask of any other human being.
 &HT;    And there are those who will say it is shameful for a president
with Clinton's history to be arrogant enough to carry on a sexual
affair with a 21-year-old right in the White House, lie about it
and then take advantage of his good friends and aides by using them
to clean up his mess and cover his tracks.
 &HT;    Both conclusions are right, of course, and thanks to Starr,
during this era of relative peace and prosperity, some very painful
divisions will fracture the body politic before the matter is put
to rest.

 &HT;    .............................................
 &HT;    Another prosecutor might have formed a different perspective on
an American president who lied about sex in a dismissed civil suit.
 &HT;    Another prosecutor could have ended the Monica Lewinsky inquiry
long ago.
 &HT;    James McKay, the Democratic independent counsel who in 1987
began investigating Republican Attorney General Meese III _ and
opted to avoid the political trauma of a trial for the nation's top
law-enforcement officer _ says that not prosecuting is one of the
hardest decisions a prosecutor makes.
 &HT;    Even within Starr's own office, there was dissent among seasoned
prosecutors over how hard to pursue the Lewinsky investigation. Two
of Starr's assistants, Michael Emmick and Bruce Udolf, argued for
accepting Lewinsky's first proffer in January, then running a swift
investigation and turning a report over to Congress in 60 days.
 &HT;    In typical Starr fashion, these issues were debated endlessly.
Over time, Starr sided with other assistants _ two of his deputies,
Robert Bittman, whom Starr affectionately calls Bulldog, and Jackie
Bennett, known among fellow prosecutors as the office expert on the
president's sex life long before anyone had heard of Lewinsky.
Ultimately, Starr opted for an investigation that would turn up
every last fact.
 &HT;    He fought up to the Supreme Court to get Clinton's Secret
Service guards to testify, up to the Supreme Court trying to get
hold of the notes of the lawyer for the late Vince Foster. Starr
pushed normal prosecutorial practices to the limit by calling
Lewinsky's mother before the grand jury.
 &HT;    It all reflected a big change in Starr. At some point, the
reserved appellate lawyer decided he would do whatever it took
within the limits of the law to squeeze people for his
investigations. He had come to realize that the White House was
going to do what defense lawyers almost always do during criminal
investigations: delay, stall, buy time.
 &HT;    What was the turning point for Starr? His assistant prosecutors
cannot pinpoint it, and who knows if even Starr can. This much is
clear: By the time Lewinsky appeared on the scene, he was poised
for an all-out assault. As to whether he was overzealous and
irresponsible or was simply ``becoming a prosecutor,'' as Rusty
Hardin, his former colleague at the beginning of the Whitewater
investigation believes _ that will depend on what is in his final
report.
 &HT;    What we do know is that Starr was willing to drive on when so
many other prosecutors would have stopped.
 &HT;    Part of the reason is Starr's legal temperament. All his
professional life, before reaching a decision, he has doggedly
pursued every last fact. His friends say it over and over: ``Ken is
determined that no one will defeat him by outworking him.''
 &HT;    As solicitor general in the Bush administration, the first case
he argued before the Supreme Court was an old-fashioned
civil-rights matter left over from the Carter era that forced the
City of Yonkers to remedy past discrimination by racially balancing
its public housing and schools. That couldn't have been a case
Starr had much political sympathy for, and yet his aides remember
his exhaustive preparation.
 &HT;    When he lost, says Robert Shapiro, a former deputy solicitor
general, ``Ken took it very hard.'' He hates to lose.
 &HT;    Starr also has a scholarly, at times pedantic, love for the law
and is genuinely offended that anyone, let alone the president of
the United States, would denigrate it. In his May ``Atticus Finch''
speech at the Charlotte, N.C., bar association, invoking the
beloved character in ``To Kill a Mockingbird,'' Starr warned that
the single biggest problem facing lawyers today is ``loss of
respect for the truth.''
 &HT;    While Starr wants to be liked, he was also raised to have
confidence in his beliefs even if most people don't agree. A detail
such as a 19 percent approval rating in the polls isn't going to
deter Starr.
 &HT;    As for his career, he had little at stake anymore. When he tried
to leave the independent counsel's job in 1997 to be a dean at
Pepperdine University, he changed his mind a few days after the
announcement due to an uproar from the press and his prosecutors;
he couldn't escape. His great dream, the Supreme Court, had long
passed. His next most likely steps _ academia and corporate law _
are assured no matter how this investigation turns out.
 &HT;    Indeed, a senior partner at Kirkland &AMP; Ellis, Thomas Yannucci,
who is close to him, says that Starr, despite taking an unpaid
leave of absence from the firm in July, plans to return when this
is all over. In what may be the understatement of the year,
Yannucci says, ``Now that he's taken on his public duty, I don't
think he has the same view of public service.''
 &HT;    Did Starr come to hate the president _ did that drive him too?
The answer is probably yes, although not at first, and not until he
felt that the White House was stonewalling. I asked John Bates, a
deputy prosecutor from 1995 to 1997, whether Starr hates Clinton.
 &HT;    Bates was quiet a long time and then gave an answer so
convoluted that I stopped taking notes. I asked again, Did Starr
hate Clinton? ``I think Ken is very upset at how personal and
political the attacks on him, the office and others in the office
have become,'' he said.
 &HT;    Did moral outrage at Clinton's sexual escapades also fuel
Starr's investigation? Lawyers who have sat with him at meetings
when these details were discussed say they could tell that Starr
was offended.
 &HT;    But when asked for a single example, a single comment or
outburst, they could not provide one. They answered that it was
subtle, in the wrinkle of an eyebrow or a quiet grimace. They had
heard his deputies make lewd remarks, but not Starr; he was too
professional for that.
 &HT;    We do know that Starr was raised to take a hard line against
such behavior. When his mother was asked for this article what she
wanted Americans to think of her son, she answered, ``I want them
to think of a man who believes in doing right and a man who does
not cheat on his wife, like Clinton has on his wife.''
 &HT;    All this said, in the end Starr's motives no longer matter. That
is his victory, his measure of vindication. It no longer matters if
malicious right-wingers consorted with his office to lay a trap for
the president, if prudishness or ambition or even radio waves from
outer space drove Ken Starr. The president has admitted misleading
the American public. He lied. Through Starr's doggedness, his
relentless effort to amass every last fact, he has succeeded in
making his investigation about Bill Clinton, not about Ken Starr.
 &HT;    All Clinton's life, the man from Hope has relied on his brains,
his charm, his boyishness, his uncanny political instincts, his
superhuman energy to squeeze through tight spots. Not this time.
This time Starr built such a wall of facts that Clinton had no
place to go. On Aug. 17, 1998, at 10 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time,
Clinton hit that wall. It was not a pretty sight.
 &HT;    Which is not to say that Starr has scored his total and complete
victory. This may or may not turn out to be about obstructing
justice, but regardless, it is lots and lots about sex, and no one
wins when such private matters are made public.
 &HT;    All who became embroiled in the Lewinsky case _ the White House,
the press and the prosecutors, too _ dirtied themselves. When Starr
needed someone to show the American public that he was acting
fairly, he hired the Watergate hero Sam Dash as his ethics adviser.
Within Starr's office, Dash is referred to as ``our secret
weapon.''
 &HT;    A generation from now, if there is another president who needs
investigating, will the special prosecutor of that era hire Starr
as his secret weapon? Not likely.
 &HT;    Once Starr drops his report at Congress's door, the nation's
attention will be riveted on Clinton. It'll be (ital)just the
facts(end ital). People laughed at Starr when he once compared
himself to Sgt. Joe Friday, but it turns out he was right, he did
have something in common with the ``Dragnet'' cop.
 &HT;    In making the decision on what should be done with Bill Clinton
_ drop the matter? censure? impeachment? _ some in Congress will
choose along partisan lines, a few will look into their own
personal lives, but most will stick their fingers into the wind and
check the public-opinion polls. The citizenry will decide. Starr
has forced Americans to confront every last prurient fact, right
down to the presidential DNA.
 &HT;    There are those who will say that half the marriages in America
end in divorce, that if every spouse who lied about sex had to
confess on TV, the testimony would fill 500 cable channels for 500
years, that this is a matter between the Clintons and that what
Bill Clinton has already publicly admitted to is more than we would
ask of any other human being.
 &HT;    And there are those who will say it is shameful for a president
with Clinton's history to be arrogant enough to carry on a sexual
affair with a 21-year-old right in the White House, lie about it
and then take advantage of his good friends and aides by using them
to clean up his mess and cover his tracks.
 &HT;    Both conclusions are right, of course, and thanks to Starr,
during this era of relative peace and prosperity, some very painful
divisions will fracture the body politic before the matter is put
to rest.

SOCCER MOM LEARNS THE SCORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For us by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALISON BASS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, I'll admitit: I secretly harbor the fantasy that my
9-year-old son will become a great soccer player, good enough to
play on the varsity team at school, and good enough to win a
scholarship to college, perhaps even an Ivy League college. Yes,
it's true: I am (or was) a competitive soccer mom, one of those
suburban jocks with big plans for her kid. I was one of Them.
</P>
<P>
   My dream started innocently enough when my son was just a
toddler and loved kicking balls around. It seemed a natural step to
sign him up for kiddie soccer, at the local Y at the tender age of
5. And by the time he was 6, I had joined the soccer fray myself,
as a coach on our town's reputed soccer league.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, I had always wanted to play soccer myself. My
brothers played on the soccer league in our community, one of the
first in the country. But as a girl, I was barred from playing on
an organized team. Even so, I grew up in a world permeated by
soccer, its rules, its rush, the intensity of players stampeding
down the field in pursuit of leather and air.
</P>
<P>
   So when my firstborn showed early signs of athletic prowess, I
seized the chance, if only in a vicarious sense. And David, for his
part, loved having his working mother as Coach. Here was a coach he
could whine to and on whose lap he could sit when he came trundling
off the field.
</P>
<P>
   When the notice of tryouts for our town's competitive traveling
soccer league arrived in the mail _ David, at age 8 going on 9,
finally qualified _ I thought, yes, this is very definitely
something I want my son to do. If he was willing to play, then I
(and my husband) were willing to give up two nights a week, plus
Saturdays, to ferry him around to practices and games in different
towns.
</P>
<P>
   The tryouts were in late October, on one of those incomparably
beautiful autumn days in New England. While I sat nervously on the
sidelines, talking to the other competitive mothers (and not a few
fathers), David went out and had a blast. Within weeks, we were
informed he had been picked for the league's most competitive team.
</P>
<P>
   The Plan was working and my fantasy took wing: here was an
American Pele in the making. Surely, that college scholarship would
be his for the asking.
</P>
<P>
   But late that fall, my motherly instincts got the best of me
when I asked the coach if it was really necessary to have 8- and
9-year-old boys practicing soccer twice a week (in addition to the
game) during a busy school year. ``Of course, it is,'' he replied
testily. ``We have to keep up with the other teams, don't we?''
</P>
<P>
   So I smothered my disquiet _ after all, I was raising an
All-American athlete. It was time for him to learn what real
competition was all about.
</P>
<P>
   The first game for my son's team came on a chilly mid-April day.
My son was just recovering from a bout with strep throat, he was
eager and ready to play, and I was eager and ready to cheer him on
from the sidelines _ until the coach spoke up. ``You're not
supposed to be standing here,'' he said. ``This is a parent-free
zone. You and the other parents need to watch from the other side.
It's the rule.''
</P>
<P>
   I was stunned. But I meekly walked to the other side of the
field and sat down. After all, he was Coach and I was just another
ambitious soccer mom.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the season didn't get much better. My husband and I
spent every game watching our son play from the other side of the
field, unable to talk to him during the game, even at halftime. (Of
course, after watching two other fathers rail at the coach for not
playing their sons long enough, I could almost understand his
insistence on keeping an entire soccer field between him and us).
</P>
<P>
   David also was not enjoying himself. After one game, he
complained that the coach would not let him sit down when he came
off the field, exhausted. At another practice, David experienced
stomach cramps, but the coach refused to let him rest.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the season, the coach had loosened up to the point
where parents were finally allowed to stand on the same side of the
field as the kids. That was good, because the final game was played
in pouring rain and every time a boy came off the field, soaked,
weary and in a few cases crying, his parent would immediately wrap
him in a raincoat or towel.
</P>
<P>
   But for David, the damage had already been done, even though I
had said nothing to him about my consternation over the league's
rules. Well before that last disastrous game, my son, the promising
soccer player, had made a blasphemous announcement: he was sick of
soccer. He didn't want to go to any more games. And he'd rather
play baseball. Now that was fun!
</P>
<P>
   I was crushed _ and then paralyzed by guilt. After all, David
would have been happy to continue playing in the town's less
competitive intramural league. It was I, the thwarted soccer jock,
who had pushed him to try out for the traveling team. And thus it
would be my fault if my son never played soccer again, dashing
dreams he never even knew about.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Much to my relief, David agreed to finish out the season and
said he did want to play soccer in the fall, but not on the
traveling team. He hated it, he said: it was too intense.
</P>
<P>
   So we've signed him up for another season of intramural soccer
and his 6-year-old brother as well. The 6-year-old, by the way, is
raring to go; he insisted on wearing his hand-me-down soccer shirts
to camp all summer and he keeps asking me when the games begin.
</P>
<P>
   I'm tempted to dream my dream all over again. But I know better:
this time, I'll let my sons choose the pace. I promise.

   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Why couldn't Whitewater independent counsel
Kenneth Starr let us have just one more day of sweet baseball joy?
The man is relentless in his pursuit of the front pages.
</P>
<P>
   Before Mark McGwire could cross the plate after his
record-breaking home run Tuesday, Starr was boxing up his evidence
against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   We got just a few hours of real life, a sports event with a
genuine historical legacy. The next day it was back to political
irreality and a president whose historical legacy will be X-rated,
and could start sooner than he expected.
</P>
<P>
   Bubba looks like a goner, and we're on an apology downer.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking serious clinical depression. Clinton is a clinical
case. We're depressed.
</P>
<P>
   We're going to have to follow Clinton until he's bundled kicking
and apologizing aboard the helicopter for his last flight from the
White House lawn.
</P>
<P>
   At least McGwire and Sammy Sosa gave us a few weeks of relief
from the national muck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let you down,'' Clinton told Democratic contributors on
Wednesday. ``I let my family down. I let this country down. I'm
trying to make it right. I'm determined never to let anything like
that happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   It was as if it took a struggle to prevent sexual encounters
with White House interns. Can we weld his pants shut?
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the uncynical spirit of St. Louis is behind us. We're
back inside the unbuckled Beltway again. McGwire and Sosa for
Clinton and Starr is one heck of a bad trade _ two true gentlemen
for two creeps.
</P>
<P>
   Events are compressing to fit Americans' tiny attention span.
The country is now one news story. CNN should give it a logo like
``America _ Oy, What a Mess.''
</P>
<P>
   The coverage on MSNBC was unbelievable. It was news stories in
collision.
</P>
<P>
   As a commentator talked about Clinton's possible ``doom,'' the
live camera showed Starr's 36 boxes (and maybe one garment bag) of
evidence loaded into Ford Broncos. Then the Broncos drove away
while the cameras gave slow chase on the freeway.
</P>
<P>
   Didn't O.J. have a garment bag, too?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, America's economic condition has become so weird that
Boris Yeltsin may be called in for advice.
</P>
<P>
   The value of a McGwire rookie baseball card reached $2,700. What
about the volatile stock market? It can't be long before Dow Jones
and Nasdaq fall below the value of a Tampa Bay Devil Rays team
card.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Forneris, a 22-year-old groundskeeper for the Cardinals, was
sweeping up peanut shells one minute and the next minute was
picking up McGwire's home run ball worth millions. He gave it back
to the slugger.
</P>
<P>
   It was a great story, until it collided with that other story.
</P>
<P>
   Forneris was immediately flown to Disney World to lead Mickey
and Goofy in a parade down Main Street. Then Forneris was taken to
greet President Clinton, who was arriving at Orlando International
Airport as part of his national apology tour.
</P>
<P>
   Forneris went on Letterman. Clinton went on Letterman's Top Ten
List again.
</P>
<P>
   America _ oy, what a mess.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the polls that say Clinton is doing a good job,
as if he's some kind of branch manager of sales, instead of a man
who is supposed to set the tone for a great country.
</P>
<P>
   I've been too occupied with baseball numerology to look at
Clinton's ratings lately. But I suppose the latest poll will say
that 67 percent of Americans think Clinton is doing a good job of
apologizing, with 21 percent of Americans saying they want to see
Clinton homeless with a cardboard sign saying ``Will apologize for
sex for food.''
</P>
<P>
   We await the latest ``Wag the Dog'' scenario in which the
president orders cruise missiles launched against the secret
underground hideouts of terrorist trains in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   No, you don't need cruise missiles to put the San Francisco
Municipal Railway out of action _ just one Cruz missile.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, Muni director Emilio Cruz got into the apology
business, too. At a meeting of the Public Transportation
Commission, he said he is ``very sorry'' for Muni's disastrous
performance over the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Give him credit. He said it without hedging, unlike Clinton's
first apology, and used one ``very'' in front of the ``sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll be using a lot more. The negative calls and letters about
Muni are running a lot faster than the trains.
</P>
<P>
   Even the cable cars can be horror shows. I got a call from Dr.
Sid Moormeister, a 53-year-old scientist with a disability. She got
on a cable car at about 12:30 p.m. Wednesday, and a Muni man said
her valid disability ID didn't look valid to him.
</P>
<P>
   The huge Muni employee yelled and tried to intimidate the petite
Moormeister into getting off the car, but she refused, saying,
``I'm riding to the top of the hill.''
</P>
<P>
   She did, too. She got off with a tourist who told of all the bad
Muni experiences she'd had in one day. Muni is rotten and
demoralized to the core. Apologies can't change a sorry system. The
best thing you can say for Muni is it distracts us from the
president's problems.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco _ oy, what a mess.

IMPEACHMENT PANIC 
</HEADLINE>
  By WILLIAM SALETAN 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   To hear the pundits tell it, President Clinton is toast. On
Sunday's political chat shows, they feasted on forecasts by Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., and Rep. Jim Moran, D-Va., that
Clinton will face impeachment proceedings. Congressional Democrats
appear to be ``done with him,'' says a party consultant.
</P>
<P>
   But the pundits' stock market in Clinton's political survival is
greatly oversold, as the result of a combination of factors.
</P>
<P>
   1. Short selling. Facing re-election this November,
congressional Democrats are playing up the possibility of
impeachment in order to distance themselves from Clinton. They've
been rushing to unload their stock in him out of fear that Kenneth
Starr's report, now in Congress' hands but still unread, includes
unforeseen bombshells. What sort of bombshells? Nobody knows. The
point of unforeseen bombshells is that they're unforeseen. We'll
believe the bombshells when we see them.
</P>
<P>
   2. Gravitas frenzy. Ever since Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn.,
condemned Clinton's behavior in a Senate floor speech last
Thursday, Democrats have been rushing to microphones to join in the
collective rebuke. The pundits think these speeches signal a
growing willingness to impeach Clinton. But this theory is too
kind. The timing and wording of recent remarks by Clinton's
congressional critics indicate that most of them are more
interested in advertising their own morals than in condemning his.
Likewise, they express more interest in immersing themselves in the
``solemn duty'' of weighing impeachment than in actually impeaching
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   3. ``Floodgate'' flood. The press loves to construe political
collapse as an objective, inexorable process. Pundits are calling
Lieberman's speech the beginning of the end--in the words of George
Will, ``a consequential pebble'' that will start ``an avalanche.''
The avalanche of avalanche metaphors, flood of flood metaphors, and
stampede of stampede metaphors are well underway. But in the end,
they're just metaphors.
</P>
<P>
   4. Regurgitory reflex. Democrats who are genuinely disgusted
with Clinton want to express their revulsion and reassure the
public that Congress doesn't condone his behavior. But Congress
doesn't have to impeach Clinton in order to convey its disapproval,
any more than it has to ban gangsta rap. In fact, by venting its
outrage in words today, Congress is relieving internal pressure to
vent that outrage in impeachment tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Together, these fears, frenzies, and fallacies have produced a
political stock market panic wholly disproportionate to the two
fundamental questions. Those questions are:
</P>
<P>
   1) Once the moral outrage has been aired and the question before
Congress has been distilled to whether the president should be
forced from office for the first time in U.S. history, will 67 U.S.
senators vote aye?
</P>
<P>
   2) Will Clinton resign unless Congress is certain to impeach
him?
</P>
<P>
   The least interesting and most salient fact about this scandal
is that the answer to both those questions is still no.
</P>

THE MESSAGE BEHIND LIEBERMAN'S SPEECH 
</HEADLINE>
  By WILLIAM SALETAN 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., stood up in the
Senate and said what most Democrats have been thinking for weeks:
President Clinton behaved like a cad with Monica Lewinsky, lied to
everyone about it and hasn't had the decency even to acknowledge
clearly that it matters and that it's his fault.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's moral criticism overshadowed three deeper insights
in his speech.
</P>
<P>
   First, Clinton's apology was insufficiently sincere, contrite
and morally emphatic. He ``could have lessened the harm his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky has caused if he had acknowledged
his mistake and spoken with candor about it to the American
people,'' said Lieberman. Instead, ``He failed to clearly
articulate to the American people that he recognized how
significant and consequential his wrongdoing was ... and his
assumption of responsibility (was) inadequate.''
</P>
<P>
   Second, Congress' inclination to punish Clinton arises in part
from his refusal to punish himself. ``(T)he transgressions the
president has admitted to are too consequential for us to walk away
and leave the impression for our children today and for ...
posterity tomorrow that what he acknowledges he did within the
White House is acceptable behavior for our nation's leader,''
Lieberman argued. Clinton's behavior must ``be followed by some
measure of public rebuke and accountability. We in Congress ... are
surely capable institutionally of expressing such disapproval
through a resolution of reprimand or censure.''
</P>
<P>
   Third, Clinton still has some credibility and goodwill, but he
must use it to deliver the more forceful apology he has withheld.
Lieberman implored his colleagues to give Clinton ``time and
space,'' to allow Clinton ``additional opportunities to accept
personal responsibility (and) to rebuild public trust in his
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's confession should have punctured the outcry for
Congress to take action. But it hasn't, because he has refused to
do it right. He should have apologized unambiguously. By gazing
deep into the nation's eyes, unflinchingly condemning his behavior,
sincerely asking for forgiveness, and vowing to turn over a new
leaf, he would have vented much of the outrage.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Clinton mixed his message. He hedged, fudged, and
offered excuses. Rather than fully absorb his share of the blame
and thereby leave Starr to absorb the remainder of the public's
outrage, he attacked Starr prematurely. He thereby defeated both
objectives: People are still angry at Clinton, and his refusal to
come clean justifies Starr's persistence.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman is sending Clinton a threefold message: He must be
held to account for his behavior. Since he has failed to hold
himself to account, Congress may have to step in. But Clinton can
still pre-empt censure--or worse--by apologizing and atoning
properly.

WHAT, EXACTLY, IS THE CIGAR STORY? 
</HEADLINE>
  By BRUCE GOTTLIEB 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The story is that Monica Lewinsky masturbated with a cigar while
President Clinton watched and masturbated as well. Yassir Arafat
was supposedly kept waiting in the Rose Garden while this was going
on in a room next to the Oval Office. The story has been widely
talked about, moderately referred to in the mainstream press, and
narrowly (i.e., in the Drudge Report, the New York Post, and
various British papers) reported as fact.
</P>
<P>
   Drudge on Aug. 22 attributed the story to ``multiple sources
close to the case'' and adds that ``several major news
organizations have confirmed the shocking episode.'' (No major U.S.
news organization has printed it.) Drudge says it's unclear whether
Lewinsky told this story to the grand jury--which is his way of
saying he has no evidence she did.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later the New York Post cited ``one insider'' who
says Lewinsky had in fact told the grand jury about the cigar, and
when Clinton was asked about it, he had to take an hour's break.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign press have had fun with the story. A sample: ``Still
not inhaling, Bill?'' (Toronto Sun); Clinton is the second
President to have had ``a Cuban Missile Crisis,'' (The
Independent). A piece in the London Daily Telegraph ponders whether
Clinton ever rolled around that particular cigar in his teeth in
public.
</P>
<P>
   The episode would qualify as ``not having sex'' under Clinton's
controversial definition. And Clinton did refuse to answer some
questions from Starr's interrogators about the details of his
relationship with Lewinsky. But it is unclear whether the story is
true--meaning only there is no good evidence that it is true.

JAPAN'S MISER MENTALITY  
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES SUROWIECKI 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thinking about Japan these days, it's hard to resist the image
of an entire country sitting in the middle of giant piles of gold,
mesmerized by the thought that as long as it remains surrounded by
the gold, everything will be OK. It's like something out of Frank
Norris' novel ``McTeague.'' The fact that the gold isn't doing
anything at all doesn't matter as much as the mere fact that it
exists.
</P>
<P>
   This image came to mind again Wednesday when the Bank of Japan
announced that, for the first time in three years, it had cut the
overnight call rate--the rate that private banks charge each other
to lend money overnight, and the equivalent of our fed funds
rate--to 0.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that the call rate had previously been just below
0.5 percent, the cut isn't going to flood the market with new
loans. But it is an interesting move because it's the first time in
recent memory that the Japanese government has tried to stimulate
the economy with monetary, rather than fiscal, policy. Along the
same lines, the BOJ announced that it would seek to expand the
money supply and to inject liquidity into the market at every
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the fact that interest rates are already
effectively nil means that the practical impact of the rate cut
will be quite small. At a time when Japanese banks are carrying
hundreds of billions of dollars in bad loans on their books, and
when the Japanese Parliament has been singularly unsuccessful in
putting aside partisan differences to pass real banking reform,
banks are being cautious in a way that they weren't during the
heyday of the Bubble Economy. And the BOJ's move, while welcome, is
itself an expression of a lack of faith in the Japanese economy,
which is sinking deeper into recession and shows no--that is,
no--signs of recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Japan's Economic Planning Agency called the economic
situation ``very severe'' and suggested that continued global
turmoil would create an ``extremely dangerous'' situation at home.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, though, the planning agency also said that
Japan's continued massive trade surplus should keep the country
relatively safe. And nary an article on Japan appears without
mention of the trillions of yen that now rest safely in Japanese
savings accounts. Far be it from me to wish for the destruction of
all that hard-earned money. But it's certainly true that one of the
reasons Japan has moved so slowly to solve its massive problems is
that those savings accounts have kept the crisis from becoming as
urgent as it really is.
</P>
<P>
   The thing about what's happening in Japan, in fact, is that
although we think it's bad, it's really much worse, at least in the
sense of what it's doing to the global economy. The disappearance
of the Japanese market for East Asian goods, the drying up of
Japanese loans, and the weak yen have all exacerbated an already
troubled situation. In the simplest sense, if you remove a sizeable
chunk of the world's economy from the process of consumption, the
economy has to feel it.
</P>
<P>
   Insofar as the BOJ's decision was a tentative step toward
inflating the yen, it was a good idea. What Japan really has to do,
after all, is--as Slate's own Paul Krugman has suggested--convince
its citizens that if they don't spend those piles of gold, they'll
be worth less next year than they are today. That will mean, of
course, that the yen will weaken.
</P>
<P>
   But the paradox here is that until Japanese consumers leave the
vault behind, the yen will never be able to be genuinely strong.
Only when demand for credit is flowing again will interest rates
rise to globally competitive levels. And that won't happen as long
as the miser mentality prevails.

MASSACHUSETTS PRIMARY TARGET _ INCREASINGLY ELUSIVE VOTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON - Massachusetts politicians vying for local, state and
national offices are bracing themselves for a record-low turnout at
the polls Sept. 15 as they scramble to fine-tune their
get-out-the-vote operations.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists say this year's voter turnout has been depressed
around the country by a strong economy, a shortage of exciting
issues, and President Clinton's embarrassing troubles. Also,
mid-term elections usually attract fewer voters than go to the
polls in a presidential election year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can confidently predict that turnout is going to be
extremely low this year,'' said Darrell M. West, a Brown University
political science professor.
</P>
<P>
   Every other state that has held a primary election so far in
1998 has contributed to the 30-year trend of declining voter
participation. The average turnout for Republicans in 1998 has been
under 8 percent and the average for Democrats has been slightly
above 9 percent, according to the Committee for the Study of the
American Electorate in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   For candidates, a low turnout means every vote is much more
valuable.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett Barrios, a lawyer running for state representative in
the 28th Middlesex district in Cambridge, is importing his mother,
father, sister, aunt and 80-year-old grandmother from Tampa to help
talk to voters in the week leading up to primary day.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Barrios campaign has identified 2,000 to 3,000
people who are likely to vote for their candidate. Campaign workers
will be armed with lists of those voters at the polls, marking them
off as they show up to cast a ballot. No-shows will receive phone
calls every three hours beginning at noon. A dozen drivers will be
on hand to pick up and deliver voters to the polls, and family
members will be there to greet them.
</P>
<P>
   Barrios says there is no way to know exactly how many votes he
will need and who will come out to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It totally depends on the turnout of the congressional race
and the weather,'' he said. ``You can win it with anywhere from two
to four thousand votes. I wish I knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Harshbarger, the front-runner Democratic candidate for
governor, recently held a picnic replete with pony rides and cotton
candy to energize his field organization, supporters, friends, and
family.
</P>
<P>
   So far, members of his field organization have made 30,000 phone
calls to ``sporadic'' voters likely to support Harshbarger. They
hope to reach likely voters through television ads, unpaid media
and campaign literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``The job is to identify those who have voted sporadically and
are now saying they will vote for Harshbarger and call them back as
often as possible up until the last couple of days to remind them
of the election,'' said Dwight Robson, Harshbarger's campaign press
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   In the race to replace Joseph P. Kennedy II as the US
representative from the 8th district, the competition for votes is
especially fierce with 10 Democrats in the primary. The campaigns
estimate that as few as 17,000 votes could win the seat in a low
turnout election.
</P>
<P>
   No one wants to be the candidate to lose by one vote, as Herbert
L. Connolly of Newton did in 1988 when he ran against Robert B.
Kennedy of Lowell in the Democratic primary for the Governor's
Council 3d District seat. Unfortunately for Connolly, he didn't
vote that day.
</P>
<P>
   The type of turnout also affects the type of candidate who is
elected. Independent voters seem particularly uninterested in the
Massachusetts primary this year, analysts say. And the people who
are drawn to the polls are likely to come from opposite ends of the
spectrum, voting for the most liberal and the most conservative
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Treasurer Joseph D. Malone, who is challenging Acting Governor
Paul Cellucci for the Republican nomination, is banking on a low
turnout consisting of very conservative Republicans. To try to
attract those voters, Malone has repeatedly attacked Cellucci for
being ``liberal,'' and has promised not to sign any budget that
exceeds the annual rate of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's playing right to the hearts and minds of conservatives,
much of it red meat,'' said Mary Anne Marsh, a Democratic political
analyst. ``If you look at his advertising, he's playing their
song.''
</P>
<P>
   The polarization of people who vote and candidates who get
nominated in the primaries is also likely to result in a Congress
that is more partisan and more fractious than ever.
</P>
<P>
   While turnout has been low around the country this year,
Massachusetts voters have traditionally voted in greater
percentages than people from other states. During the last four
mid-term primaries here, the percentage of registered voters who
cast ballots swung back and forth from 48 percent in 1982 to 26
percent in 1986 to 50 percent in 1990 to 26 percent in 1994. That
is a range of anywhere from 700,000 to 1.5 million voters. As of
February of 1998, there are 3,650,026 citizens registered to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Massachusetts, seven states will hold primaries on Sept.
15. They are: Rhode Island, Maryland, Oklahoma, Minnesota,
Connecticut, Washington and New York.
</P>
<P>
   West believes the politics of small ideas is a large factor in
the diminishing number of voters coming out to the polls on
election day.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have concluded that the stakes of politics aren't very
high because you have politicians pushing mini-ideas,'' he said.
``In the past, the top predictor of people turning out to vote is
if they feel their vote will make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   He said politicians have failed in recent times when they took
on large-scale projects such as the overhaul of health care or in
reducing the size of government concluding and have concluded that
they would be better off avoiding such undertakings.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Gans, the director of the Committee on the Study of the
American Electorate, said there is still a wildcard in this year's
election as the stock market fluctuates erratically.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the potential for an economic contraction begins to reflect
itself in unemployment statistics before late September, there
might be some mobilization by people who are worried about their
economic future,'' Gans said.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, is likely to benefit Republicans in November
because they do not currently control the White House. And the
party that holds the White House during difficult economic times is
usually the party that shoulders the blame.
</P>
<P>
   Another uncertainty is the upcoming Independent Counsel report
on Clinton's relationship with former intern Monica Lewinsky, Gans
said. Democrats have been distancing themselves from the president,
criticizing his conduct and encountering a malaise among their
constituents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is going to know fully well how to handle it,'' Gans
said.

 Army test raises chlamydia alarms
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 10 percent of women US Army recruits tested positive for
chlamydia in a recent study, indicating the sexually transmitted
disease that can make women infertile threatens public health more
than is commonly appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   Because the infection lingers for months and as many as 4 out of
5 women with the disease do not show symptoms, more widespread
screening for chlamydia through DNA testing of urine samples could
help slow its spread, a study in the current New England Journal of
Medicine suggests. It is easily treated with antibiotics. Men and
women who have multiple sex partners can use condoms to avoid
infecting others.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Charlotte A. Gaydos of the Johns Hopkins medical school &UR;  &LR; and
colleagues tested 13,204 female Army recruits at Fort Jackson,
South Carolina, during 1996 and 1997. A total of 9.2 percent had
chlamydia, including 12.2 percent of the 17-year-old recruits.
Fewer than 5 percent of women from Massachusetts or from
northwestern states that have aggressively targeted chlamydia
tested positive, but more than 15 percent of recruits from five
Deep South states did, Gaydos reported. An accompanying editorial
urges wider testing at schools and community groups to alert those
with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   In another study dealing with a sexually transmitted disease,
regular doses of the antiviral drug famciclovir eliminated herpes
simplex outbreaks for a year in nearly three-quarters of men and
women who previously suffered frequent recurrences.
</P>
<P>
   The study, led by Dr. Francisco Diaz-Mitoma of Children's
Hospital of Eastern Ontario and published in the current Journal of
the American Medical Association, found the best results from
taking 250 milligrams daily of famciclovir. SmithKline Beecham,
which sells the product as Famvir, helped fund the peer-reviewed
study. It is the third drug shown to control herpes.

<P>
   Animal research conducted at Duke University is suggesting
possible cures for diabetes and ovarian cancer. Duke medical
researchers writing in this month's Metabolism journal showed they
could reverse Type 2 diabetes in mice by cutting fat in their diet
from 40 percent to 10 percent of their caloric intake. More than 14
million Americans have this kind of diabetes, which triggers
blindness and kidney failure.
</P>
<P>
   The study bolsters assertions that human diabetics should worry
more about fat than sugar, but ``it's not yet clear what the
absolute limit of fat intake would be for people to derive some
benefit,'' said Dr. Richard Surwit, the leader of the study.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Duke's Dr. Gus Rodriguez and colleagues report, in
the Journal of the Society for Gynecologic Investigation, on new
insights into the mechanism by which birth-control pills reduce a
woman's risk of ovarian cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Studying macaque monkeys who were given hormone pills for nearly
three years, Rodriguez found that the synthetic hormone progestin
effectively triggers damaged ovarian cells to kill themselves
before they turn cancerous. His team plans to study whether it
would be safe and beneficial to administer progestin as a kind of
vaccine against ovarian cancer, which kills 17,000 American women
annually.

 &UR; 3 for the heart
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who ever took the died drug fenfluramine should see a
doctor for a heart checkup, concludes a New England Journal of
Medicine editorial by Dr. Richard B. Devereux of Cornell Medical
Center. Devereux evaluated three studies that confirm much higher
rates of heart valve damage among people who took the drug. ...
It's also worth taking seriously any diagnosis that you are among
the 2 million Americans with an irregular-heartbeat condition
called atrial fibrillation. Data from the 50-year Framingham Heart
Study, analyzed in the American Heart Association journal
Circulation, show that women with atrial fibrillation were 90
percent more likely to die during the decade studied than women
with regular heartbeats, and men about 50 percent more likely,
after sifting out all other factors. ... A London doctor contends
that fewer people would die of heart attacks if doctors did a
better job conveying what the attacks feel like. In the British
Medical Journal, St. George's Hospital surgeon Tom Treasure said
doctors should dispel ``the myth of a fat, red-faced man gasping
and clutching at his tie'' and let people know a heart attack's
onset may feel like ``tightening,'' a lump in the throat,
indigestion, gassiness, and ``a need to keep swallowing.''

THIS ELECTION SEASON, SENIORS MAY ROCK THE VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ John Peckham sat patiently among rows of crowded tables
in the meeting room of the Golden Age senior center in Charlestown.
</P>
<P>
   The 64-year-old rested his hands on a pair of black sunglasses
passed out by one politician. He eyed another candidate making her
rounds among the tables of prized elderly voters. And he waited for
other Democrats running for the 8th Congressional District to show
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think they want your vote,'' said Peckham.
</P>
<P>
   That may be the biggest understatement of the hotly contested
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Because this is not a presidential year, turnout is expected to
be about 30 percent for the Sept. 15 primary, with perhaps 65,000
making it to the polls in the 8th District, those familiar with the
race say. Of that, the candidates believe as many as half will be
seniors.
</P>
<P>
   Elderly facilities within the district have become battlegrounds
as the 10 Democratic candidates vie for votes. Competition abounds
to schedule events at these places. Candidates are turning up at
blood pressure screenings, staking out bus stops, and going to
teas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's goal is to talk to those people who are going to
vote and persuade them to support your candidate,'' said Mary Anne
Marsh, a consultant for Chris Gabrieli. ``In that respect, elders
are the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. ... This has become
an Olympic sport.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Golden Age senior center one day last month, Susan Tracy
and Somerville Mayor Michael Capuano addressed different tables in
the small room at the same time. Outside, Councilor Thomas Keane
lamented the fact that so many candidates were showing up at the
same time _ he didn't know that was going to happen _ and paused on
the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you start to overwhelm people, they start to lose
attention,'' Keane said, grimacing.
</P>
<P>
   Back inside, Anne McRae, 80, says she is voting for former
Vatican ambassador Raymond L. Flynn. ``He really needs a job,''
McRae said.
</P>
<P>
   John Peckham says he's still undecided.
</P>
<P>
   But it's one thing for a candidate to make a pitch to an older
voter. It's another thing entirely for that to convert to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   So candidates are banking on a couple of key tactics: catchy
campaign paraphernalia and get-out-the-vote plans.
</P>
<P>
   Capuano hands out sunglasses and magnifying-glass bookmarks,
which a few older voters have accepted indignantly, saying they can
see just fine.
</P>
<P>
   Gabrieli, a Beacon Hill resident and one of two millionaires in
the race, passes out a popular purple bingo dauber wrapped in a
gold sticker that reads ``Win with Gabrieli.'' His buttons are
printed in extra-large type.
</P>
<P>
   Cambridge environmentalist John O'Connor distributes hand-held
fans with his name on them. Gabrieli outdid him, printing an image
of his face on paper fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I we're a political vendor, I would be in seventh heaven,''
said George Bachrach, a candidate from Watertown.
</P>
<P>
   Get-out-the-vote plans include such things as distribution of
forms for absentee ballots in elderly housing and nursing homes as
well as transportation to polling stations.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the over-60 crowd has gotten very demanding in
telling the politicians just what they want in return for their
attention, and possibly their vote.
</P>
<P>
   Seniors have not so subtly told Gabrieli that if he wants to
chat over lunch, they want him to provide hot food, not sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   Elderly voters also enjoy the opportunity to express their views
to candidates on the all-important issues of health care and
housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important because of the fact that Social Security
and Medicare are under attack,'' said Elsie Frank, president of the
Massachusetts Association of Older Americans, who was campaigning
for Tracy at the Golden Age center. ``They will vote for whoever
they think will protect their interests.''

MATH, SCIENCE TEACHERS IN HIGH DEMAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JORDANA HART  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nick Neeb was a hot property this summer as public school
principals in Massachusetts scoured resumes, called colleagues, and
advertised for math teachers in a market where 30 percent of math
teachers were not even math majors _ or minors _ in college.
</P>
<P>
   With school districts vying for math and science teachers as if
they were sports figures, the 34-year-old former aerospace engineer
who taught high school math in Minnesota was wooed and courted by
more than seven school districts. Some offered more money, and one
even promised Neeb a job after only a couple of long-distance
telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Neeb chose Wayland (Mass.) High School, where he began Sept. 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of months ago, all I hoped for was a job,'' he said.
``What I was finding, much to my delight, was that I had my pick.''
</P>
<P>
   In the race to fill math and science slots in the state's public
schools, some principals said they get about 250 resumes for
English or social studies openings, but only 50 or so for math, and
fewer still for physics or chemistry. Among the math applicants,
principals said, they routinely found candidates who are
technically certified, but are considered unprepared because they
have no college major or minor in math.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are not a lot of people who are excited about those
areas, or qualified to teach them, so I get nervous,'' said John
D'Auria, the principal of Wellesley (Mass.) Middle School, who is
looking for a sixth-grade math teacher. ``To find someone, I
network and call colleagues, I advertise, go to college career
centers. For the first time, I posted the job on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The statistics tell a grim story at a time when schools
nationwide are feeling the pressure to improve student performance
in math, physics, and chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1996 international test of math and science, American
high school seniors scored below students from 17 other countries,
outperforming only their peers in Lithuania, Cyprus, and South
Africa, according to the Third International Mathematics and
Science Study, which oversees the testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we look at the quality of our teaching force and the
systemic underinvestment in teacher quality and teacher learning,
we have the lowest scores of developed nations,'' said David
Haselkorn, president of Recruiting New Teachers, a national
recruiting organization based in Belmont, Mass. ``This may not be a
correlation, but surely it is more than coincidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Principals said they have noticed more applicants who are
changing their careers, like mathematicians and engineers from the
private sector. Many have just been certified and are taking their
first teaching position, while a few others have sought waivers and
are teaching with no previous experience.
</P>
<P>
   Educators are divided over this new crop of teachers. While some
say they are energetic and can learn to teach, others worry that
teaching skills are being cast aside in the zeal to attract people
with expertise in math and science.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is better to have someone who has teaching experience or is
at least moving toward certification,'' said Michael Jones,
principal at Maynard High School. ``Many people think they can just
walk into a classroom and start talking about what interests
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones got lucky last week when he hired a former public
relations manager for a high-tech firm who had majored in math, and
happened to be certified to teach.
</P>
<P>
   But many districts are not so fortunate. According to a 1997
state-by-state assessment of math and science teachers, more than
30 percent of those teaching math in grades 7 through 12 do not
have a major in the field.
</P>
<P>
   About 11 percent of science teachers in grades 9 through 12, and
32 percent of teachers in grades 7 and 8, have no major in their
fields, according to the study. Several studies show that in urban
schools serving largely low-income students of color, the number of
unprepared, even uncertified, math and science teachers skyrockets
to 60 or 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And the relatively small numbers of students graduating from
education schools with an interest in teaching math or sciences
does not bode well for future classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a total of 287 teacher candidates took the English
test in the state's teacher certification exam in April and July.
But only 144 took the math test, 13 took physics, 23 took
chemistry, and 107 took biology. And only 46 percent of the math
teacher candidates on both tests actually passed. The pass rates
for the sciences, however, were much higher.
</P>
<P>
   The key to attracting more qualified teachers to math and
science, say educators, is making the profession more lucrative and
attractive to mathematicians and scientists who, unlike English and
history majors, have many opportunities in private industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, in math and science, people have options,'' said
Sarah Cass, founder and president of City on a Hill Charter School
in Boston. ``There are a lot of professions that would be
attractive and remunerative for people with that background.''
</P>
<P>
   Neeb, the new Wayland math teacher, should know. Despite his
absolute love of teaching, he admitted still being hesitant with
his answer when people ask him what he does for a living.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know teaching is noble and great things happen in
classrooms, but part of me wishes I was telling people I was an
engineer,'' Neeb said. ``I haven't come to terms with teachers not
being held in very high esteem.''

HE STOOD FOR POLITICS AT ITS BEST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- He was arguably the best mayor Boston never had,
among a handful of people who mattered most to the turbulent city
of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   No one did more for the House of Representatives over the last
generation who was never elected to it; no history of national
affairs in the 1980s is complete without his large thumbprint.
</P>
<P>
   The last four presidents have known all about his special gifts
and felt their impact; the two Democrats (the completely different
Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton) had more than one occasion to depend
on them big time.
</P>
<P>
   On an average day he could get your brother a fair shot at the
police force, help repair Social Security, broker the biggest tax
bill of modern times, keep the Big Dig's cash coming, and still
make it home for supper.
</P>
<P>
   All across the intersections where politics and government meet
in the interests of real people, the shock and pain at Kirk
O'Donnell's death over the Labor Day weekend is the only recent
event to unite Republicans, congressional Democrats, and
Clintonites in this season of shame and ugliness.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think all this emotion concerned a senior statesman
passing on after a long lifetime of service, the occasion for a
proud-sad moment to celebrate a life lived magnificently.
</P>
<P>
   But the shock and pain arrived like a rusty blade in the gut
because O'Donnell was only 52; he did things in his 30s and 40s
that big shots in their 60s never accomplish. But the best was
still ahead of him, and the sky was the limit; if the Democrats
ever elect another president, a Cabinet post or chief of the White
House staff would have been lateral movements for him.
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of death that shakes your faith, making it all
the more important to reaffirm it. And the fact is this blend of
Dorchester and D.C., of Boston Latin and Brown was a walking
reaffirmation of faith in the potential of public service, a
shining example of the silent majority who don't broker votes for
cash, check their principles at the front desk, ignore their
families, welsh on their commitments, indulge their whims and their
urges, lie, and shirk. His life demonstrates that at the end only
two things matter _ whether your word's any good and how you treat
others.
</P>
<P>
   Two stories: Kevin Hagen White gets the credit for discovering
him in the early years of decentralized innovation and leadership
and hope for the racially polarized town. By 1975, the young
political junkie who could explain Boston by precinct or by parish
was entrusted with White's third-term reelection campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It was the roughest, ugliest, closest fight in modern Boston
times. The people involved, despite all they've done since, still
get together to tell the old stories and refight the old shouting
matches. The one reputation that was enhanced by the bruising
experience was O'Donnell's, for focusing like a laser beam on
organizing the White vote and focusing on Joe Timilty's lack of a
clear alternative.
</P>
<P>
   After it was over and he was down in Washington with Tip
O'Neill, it was increasingly clear that his former boss had lost
his fastball. Again and again, from the shadows of the speaker's
rooms in the Capitol, O'Donnell saw to Boston's interests. He would
happily recount to me the stories of program formulas rejiggered to
benefit the cities, of special items in appropriations bills (worth
billions of dollars over time) as long as I understood that if I
used his name in public he would rip my lungs out.
</P>
<P>
   Just for the record, O'Donnell was more than enough of a city
lover and urban scholar to know about subway analogies in politics.
But he was the guy, in 1981, who called Social Security the third
rail of American politics; few lines have been ripped off more. But
he did it to make a point _ that Ronald Reagan had touched it by
reaching beyond his mandate to try to slash future benefits in a
partisan initiative. With the help of the worst recession in 50
years, he and Speaker O'Neill pounced on that goof to effectively
end the Reagan Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   But that same skill was then put to use on the speaker's behalf
to help broker a bipartisan repair job that has lasted 15 years and
made the next stage of generational common sense possible. He was
to Congress in the 1980s what Jim Baker was to the Reagan White
House.
</P>
<P>
   He was a big guy, with a big voice he rarely used except to
laugh. Everyone trusted him. There are tears being shed today in
saloons and salons, in boardrooms and in back rooms. Kirk
O'Donnell's life demonstrates the power of the haunting challenge
made famous by the Kennedys, that all of us can make a difference
and that each of us should try.

IN THE MASSACHUSETTS 8TH, IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE WHO WINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the 8th District, it makes no difference who wins &QC; 
Ten Democrats are competing to succeed Joe Kennedy in Congress, and
from the attention their primary battle has received, you might
think the outcome actually mattered.
</P>
<P>
   The 8th Congressional District fight has received saturation
coverage in the Boston media. The candidates have been interviewed
and re-interviewed. Their debates, their finances, their ads, their
poll numbers _ (itals)everything(unitals) about their campaigns has
been obsessively reported. Most of the national media have weighed
in with stories as well.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this fuss is deserved. The Boston-Cambridge seat in
Congress has a remarkable pedigree. Before Joe K carpetbagged into
the district from Marshfield to claim it in 1986, it was occupied
for many years by Tip O'Neill; before him, by John F. Kennedy; and
before him, by James Michael Curley, the legendary governor, mayor,
and prison inmate.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the candidates running in this race is an O'Neill, a
Kennedy, or a Curley. None rises head and shoulders above the rest.
None _ except Ray Flynn, whose drinking has been examined on ``60
Minutes'' _ has a national reputation. None has the charisma of
JFK, the abundant political gifts of O'Neill, or even the corrupt
charm of Curley.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these candidates are handsome, some are earnest, some
are good talkers. But politically? They are birds of a feather, a
flock of barely distinguishable left-wing Massachusetts liberals.
Flynn is the bibulous liberal, Michael Capuano is the Italian
liberal, Susan Tracy is the lesbian liberal, George Bachrach is the
Jewish liberal, John O'Connor and Chris Gabrieli are the
millionaire liberals, and Marjorie Clapprood is the liberal who
likes to talk dirty. But on nine issues out of 10, they all have
the same opinions, say the same things, and would vote the same
way. Most are even more left-leaning than Joe Kennedy. (Example: He
supports the death penalty. All his would-be successors save one _
Gabrieli _ are opposed.)
</P>
<P>
   For all the publicity this contest is getting, the most salient
fact about it has gone unmentioned: It will make no difference who
wins. Assuming that the seat goes to the victor in the primary, the
next US representative from the 8th District will be, ho-hum,
another Ted Kennedy-Ed Markey-Barney Frank liberal from the outer
left precincts of the Democratic Party. Golly, how surprised
everyone in Washington will be.
</P>
<P>
   Not only will it make no difference who wins this race, but
whoever wins this race will likely make no difference.
</P>
<P>
   For the new congressman from Cambridge and Boston will be a
freshman in a body where seniority is consequential. He (or she)
will be a Democrat in a Congress with a Republican majority _ and
if the tea-leaf diviners are right, the 106th Congress will be even
more Republican than the 105th.
</P>
<P>
   It will be hard enough to accomplish anything as a freshman
Democrat. As a freshman Democrat from
(itals)Massachusetts(unitals), Joe Kennedy's successor is assured
of having no clout. The Bay State, after all, is one of only four
states with an all-Democratic congressional delegation, and the
only one of significance in terms of industry or population. There
is a price to be paid for shunning the nation's dominant political
party. The price for Massachusetts is a notable lack of influence
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   I am no fan of massive congressional spending, and have little
doubt that America would be better off if the federal budget were
reduced by about 50 percent. All the same, a useful measure of a
state's sway in the capital is how it fares when the annual
spending pie is dished out. Massachusetts depends deeply on federal
highway funds to sustain its expensive Big Dig, the largest public
works project in the country; few types of government largesse are
as critical to the Bay State. Yet this year, Massachusetts was
unable to prevent a sharp drop in its share of the federal highway
appropriation. Worse: It was the only state whose funds were cut.
</P>
<P>
   That would not have happened if voters in 1996 had retained
Peter Blute and Peter Torkildsen, the Republicans who represented
the 3rd and 6th congressional districts. (Or if William Weld had
been elected to the Senate.) Voters no doubt had their reasons for
adding two more liberal Democrats to what was already a very
liberal Democratic delegation. But their decision wasn't cost-free.
If Massachusetts chooses to have nothing to do with the Republican
caucus on Capital Hill, it shouldn't be surprised when the
Republican caucus returns the favor.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, voters can't be blamed for electing Democrats if the
Republicans don't bother to nominate decent candidates. During
Weld's 6 1/2 years as governor, the state's Republican
infrastructure disintegrated, with the result that a bare handful
of Democratic officeholders in Massachusetts face a GOP challenge
this year. There are credible Republican aspirants for only two of
the state's 10 seats in the US House _ state Senator Matthew
Amorello in the 3rd and Torkildsen, the former congressman, in the
6th.
</P>
<P>
   What that means is that (itals)those(unitals) are the only races
that really matter, the races where something is at stake. Come
November, voters in the 3rd and 6th will face a genuine choice _ a
contest between candidates of different parties, different views,
and different values. Next week's primary in the 8th, by contrast,
is a competition among clones. Yeah, it's been an entertainment.
But it makes absolutely no difference who wins.

ABSOLUTE ABSOLUTION FOR ALL _ ALMOST 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRIAN COPELAND  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It seems that everyone is asking for forgiveness
these days. Everywhere I look, somebody's apologizing for something
and begging for absolution.
</P>
<P>
   The president wants us to forgive him for lying to, pardon me,
``misleading'' us. I say, ``Why not?'' We forgave him for all of
the other times, so why not this one?
</P>
<P>
   Pro basketball's Latrell Sprewell wants coach P.J. Carlesimo's
forgiveness for his Boston Strangler routine. Latrell's suing, but
he's sorry. Everybody's on the sorry bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland wants forgiveness for stealing millions from
Holocaust victims.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is considering asking blacks' forgiveness for
slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Since everybody wants to be forgiven, I thought I'd take the
bull by the horns, absolve a few folks and save them the trouble of
groveling.
</P>
<P>
   I forgive Geraldo Rivera for signing a new, long-term contract
with NBC, thus subjecting us to him for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   I forgive Pacific Bell for considering the possibility of
charging more than $1 for a directory assistance call that should
be free in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   I forgive Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes for making ``The
Avengers.'' On second thought, forget it. Some things are just
plain unforgivable. Diana Rigg is turning over in her grave and
she's not even dead yet.
</P>
<P>
   I forgive the news media for casting a pall over Mark McGwire's
quest for Roger Maris' single season homerun record by focusing on
the fact that he'd been taking a legal muscle enhancer that doesn't
violate the rules of major league baseball.
</P>
<P>
   I forgive attorney Gloria Allred, who's made a fortune
condemning domestic violence, yet turned into Marcel Marceau when
in the Phil Hartman murder/suicide, the shooter was a woman.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto the National Organization for Women for only condemning
male predators who don't share their political philosophies.
</P>
<P>
   I forgive Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas for his
ignorance in believing that the fact he's black had nothing to do
with his nomination to succeed Thurgood Marshall on the Supreme
Court and that he was truly the most qualified jurist in the nation
for that appointment _ thus justifying his attacks on affirmative
action.
</P>
<P>
   I forgive the editors of all of the newspapers and magazines and
the producers of all of the television shows that are spending an
entire month pimping the death of Princess Diana.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, I forgive Bill Clinton and Kenneth Starr for
forcing me to explain to my 9-year-old the meanings of ``oral
sex,'' ``sexual relations'' and an ``inappropriate relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, maybe not. As I said, some things are unforgivable.

THE WINTER FASHION NEWS IS WHITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUZANNE C. RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like it or not, fashion lovers, Labor Day is over. It's time to
pack away our white summer pants, skirts, and matching shoes.
</P>
<P>
   We have to make room for our fall clothes _ in winter white.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the hottest colors this season, along with the
ever-present gray. Both colors can be worn anywhere, day or night,
and can be complemented with splashes of scarlet, black, or even
brown. (Other strong colors include plum, redwood brown, camel,
loden green, chocolate brown, and black).
</P>
<P>
   Mary Lou Andre, president of the wardrobe management company
Organization by Design, cautions not to take the winter-white look
to extreme by wearing it to work, head-to-toe. ``It has an, `I
don't want to get dirty' message,'' she says. But certainly
winter-white makes a statement off the job.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you're going to wear a colorless white or a drab
gray during the colder months, your makeup is going to need punch
to avoid a washed-out look. ``My favorite place to experiment with
color this fall is on the lips,'' says New York makeup artist Bobbi
Brown, who applies the models' makeup in a number of major
designers' fashion shows. ``I used a lot of coral and wine on the
runway, and I think the pop of a bright lip is a very modern way to
wear color this season.''
</P>
<P>
   Her company, Bobbi Brown Professional Cosmetics Inc., is pushing
pink cheeks, coral and wine lipsticks, and red, rose and wine nail
polishes. ``You don't have to match nail and lip color,'' she adds.
``It's more modern to use color on the nails as an accent, to have
fun with different shades.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from hues, the biggest fall fashion news this year is
really the hemline. Continuing the summer trend, skirts will be
worn long in coming weeks _ very long. Ankle-length will probably
be preferred by most women, since, says Boston designer Alfred
Fiandaca, ``From the last 10 years, we've learned that all legs are
not perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some designers are pushing a more grandmotherly skirt
_ just below the knee or long and full with pleats. But that
silhouette may not please everyone.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, pants haven't become passe. Ralph Lauren unveiled
dress trousers in wool, tweed, flannel, suede, and even cargo-style
at his fall show, paired with tops like silk shirts and
turtlenecks. Likewise, Linda Allard, at Ellen Tracy, introduced
flowing, wide-legged dress pants at her show, paired with such
items as tailored leather shirts, beaded tunics, and funnel-neck
sweaters. These are all a useful alternative to the structured pant
and suit-jacket, which is still available. This season that look
often involves elongated, (thigh-length) jackets.
</P>
<P>
   Now that designers have convinced us that it's fine to wear
synthetic year-round fabrics such as polyester, the finicky fashion
community has changed its mind. Textured, natural fabrics were
embraced by designers worldwide this season, especially cashmere,
tweed, leather, shearling, and itchy mohair.
</P>
<P>
   All of them fall under the category that Allard describes as
reality-based luxury. In this genre, a little daytime glitz is
chic.
</P>
<P>
   So, on the streets, expect to see embellishments like: fur trims
on hats or sweaters (a repeat from last winter); metallic threads
in clothing (not loud, but subtle); turtlenecks in sparkling
fabrics; and cobweb beading on sheer tops. ``You can wear sparkling
threads from day to evening,'' says Fiandaca. ``It works in the
workplace. It's wonderful at night.''

TAKING STOCK OF THE SEASON PAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE HATCH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The end is in sight _ seven weeks to the average date for first
frost, give or take a week, depending on location.
</P>
<P>
   Much is past (lots of roses and vegetables, many perennials),
much is at its peak (late-summer champs such as marigolds and
cosmos), and some is yet to come (my small burning bushes, Euonymus
alata ``Compacta,'' are just coloring; soon they will be a blazing
red).
</P>
<P>
   The days are peppered now with the yellow of coreopsis,
``Moonbeam'' with its delicate foliage and small flowers and the
larger ``Sunburst'' jostling with ornamental grasses and baptisia.
</P>
<P>
   I look up to the flower heads waving atop the super grasses,
7-foot Miscanthus sinensis ``Gracillimus'' and 9-foot Erianthus
ravennae, and I gaze down on bearberry, Arctostaphylos uva-ursi,
merrily spreading at the base of Fothergilla major. Its fine
foliage will turn bronze, while the fothergilla, now 2 feet high
and eventually, maybe, 9 feet, will turn a brilliant yellow.
</P>
<P>
   In wilder areas grow, unbidden by me but welcome nonetheless,
goldenrod and Queen Anne's lace.
</P>
<P>
   Nights are rendered sensuous by the scents of nicotiana, which
has taken a hit from sun and heat, and tuberoses, an experiment
this summer that will be repeated tenfold next year. The tuberoses
send out gardenia-like scent from waxy, white trumpet flowers atop
3-foot stems.
</P>
<P>
   It is time to begin evaluating the growing season, though there
is plenty of time for some things to rebound (and maybe a few to
yet fail). I hope some of the new English roses rebound. They never
seemed to catch hold. The soil is to blame, as always, at least
somewhat, with things made worse by heat and lack of rain. But
maybe they just weren't strong enough to begin with. Other English
roses did fine, so write it off to the vagaries of gardening.
</P>
<P>
   Geraniums (species, not the Pelargonium houseplants my
grandmother grew in tin cans) plunked along the edge of the rose
garden likewise flagged, the Bergenia cordifolia ``Bressingham
White'' did better, and the lamb's ears (a new kind that does not
flower) were great. More of them go in next year, as well as
geraniums and bergenia. The plan was sound, I have decided, and
masses of them are required.
</P>
<P>
   But first, many, many wheelbarrows of horse manure will be
worked into that barren, too-well-drained soil. It is time for
serious maintenance and improvement planning.
</P>
<P>
   It was a little late, but I finally divided the Siberian iris
clump in the driveway bed. In the nine years we have lived here, we
had not touched them. They grew in a big circle, barren in the
center. Grasses do that. It's their way of moving on when you have
ignored their signals to divide them.
</P>
<P>
   It required a pitchfork, a freshly sharpened kitchen knife, and
a wheelbarrow to hold the clumps after I wrestled them out of the
ground. I carefully chose a sunny day with temperatures in the high
80s (suffering is, after all, good for the soul).
</P>
<P>
   The center of the clump I dug out and tossed in the composter.
The clumps I divided into rhizomes with leaves, taking the
healthier looking ones and replanting them into soil enriched with
composted manure.
</P>
<P>
   Others went along the front of a new stone wall along the road,
where I will mix them with daffodils.
</P>
<P>
   Still others I had no place for, so I sunk them in large pieces
in a barren stretch along a rear stone wall where they can provide
some spring display until they get moved again. This last operation
was made more enjoyable by the briars that already occupied those
spots and the Newfoundland dog that came to occupy the holes once I
began digging. Out, Lucy, out!
</P>
<P>
   While some plantings disappointed this season, that is normal.
New plantings are a risk. It is why you are well advised to not
spend too much on one plant, no matter how rare and desirable,
unless money is no object. And plants that seemingly are toast this
year may pop back the next.
</P>
<P>
   The Lucy garden, by the brick landing out back, so called
because it attracts canines (Lucy and her cohort, Tessie, but only
when it has nice new plants), this spring got a male holly and
several hostas, including a pricy little Japanese fellow. It is a
plant that bespoke genteel beauty to me, but beckoned bathroom to
the hounds. Maybe it will survive; I will fence it first chance I
get.
</P>
<P>
   Now is time to do some weeding, to give plants a last chance to
suck up moisture and nutrients and prepare for winter. It is time
to think about overseeding the lawn, for soon the annual weed
grasses will be on their way out and the bare patches will be
apparent. And it is time to dig out the plans for spring bulbs, as
the first, Galanthus nivalis, common snowdrops, have arrived. I
think they go under the dwarf Colorado spruce by the front walk,
which would make sense, because then they could delight at the very
beginning of the next season.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, next season. It helps make this time special, straddling
the disappointments and the delights of this season with the hopes,
nay, sureties, of gardening to come.

SALT IN TREE TRUNK HELPS KEEP NEW SAPLINGS FROM SPROUTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My neighbor cut down a tree on his own property, which is OK
with me because the tree was a real ``weed tree.'' The trunk, about
12 inches in diameter, sticks up about 5 inches. My concern is that
the stump might produce a few more saplings, starting the cycle all
over again. How can that stump be killed?
</P>
<P>
   CHARLIE DELLANNO, Somerville, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Maples tend to grow saplings out of the stump, and so might
Ailanthus, the tree of heaven, which is termed a city tree by some,
a weed tree by others.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not saplings might grow, you can kill the stump by
drilling holes in the trunk and filling them with salt and adding
water. Add more salt as the salt dissolves. Or, have a tree
specialist grind the stump out, removing it entirely.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am filling in holes in the floor where a heating vent was
removed, using yellow hard pine boards to match the original
flooring. Trouble is, the old flooring is 3 1/4 inches wide, and I
can only find boards 3 1/8 inches wide. What can I do?
</P>
<P>
   STAN PITTMAN, Shelburne, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You may have to have some boards custom-made. At any rate,
call or write to the Southern Forest Products Assn., PO Box 641700,
Kenner, LA 70064-1700, 504-443-4464. The association could tell you
if it sells 3 1/4-inch boards, tell you where they can be found, or
custom-make a few boards. You might find a cabinetmaker who could
mill wider boards down to the right size.
</P>
<P>
   Another trick might be to take up some of the old boards out of
a closet or other inconspicuous spot, and use those. You can fill
in the closet boards with almost anything.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I read your story about oil tanks and leaks and other
problems. I have to replace my oil-fired house heater, and am
wondering if now is a good time to stay with oil or switch to gas.
What are the advantages of each?
</P>
<P>
   DEBBY HARRINGTON, Charlestown, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The ony advantage to switching to gas, in my opinion, is
getting rid of the oil tank in the cellar, which is not only an
eyesore but a space-taker as well. But, also in my opinion, this is
no reason to switch, mainly because gas fuel is more expensive than
oil.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am replacing the shingles on my garage roof, which is a hip
roof, with slopes going down all four sides from a point. Is it
necessary to ventilate the garage? I also have an old picket fence
that has been stored for some time in the garage. It looks good,
and is sound. Is there any reason I should not install it now?
</P>
<P>
   JIM, from Brighton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. First, the fence: Go ahead and install it. It will give you
good service. Be sure to use hot-dipped galvanized, stainless
steel, or brass fasteners to resist rust.
</P>
<P>
   OK, the roof: The garage does not have to be ventilated except
to keep it cool in summer. Opening windows will accomplish that,
except heat will rise into the ceiling, trapping hot air. A cupola
on the point of the roof would let a lot of that air out and will
be decorative, too.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I stripped the paint off the exterior wood pillars on my
house; the wood is really dry. Should I treat them with oil before
painting? Also, some of my floors are sagging. Who should I contact
to fix them?
</P>
<P>
   PAULA LOVEJOY, Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You don't need oil to treat the pillars before painting; the
idea of ``feeding'' dry wood is an old wives' tale. Wood is
supposed to be dry. It would be OK to treat the pillars with oil
before painting, which would allow the paint to adhere better. But
it would be better not to paint, but to treat the pillars with two
thin coats of a latex solid stain. Such a stain will resist peeling
and will be good for five years. As for the professional to check
your floors, find a carpenter who is familiar with old houses and
who can determine what is causing the sagging and fix it, or at
least stablize the floor to keep it from sagging further. The
joists may not be big enough, or the center beam is dropping a bit.
There are other reasons for sagging or slanting floors, but most of
them can be corrected.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The tenants just left the rental unit of my two-family house,
and I discovered several ropes broken in the windows. Who should I
contact to fix them? One man suggested that I use chains instead of
ropes when I replace them. Is this correct? Can any insulation be
put in the space where the weights go up and down?
</P>
<P>
   E.S., Brighton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Find a handyman or carpenter, but the man who suggested you
use chains instead of ropes has a point because chains will last
longer than ropes; in fact, indefinitely. Be sure to get solid
brass sash chain. Those weighted windows are the best you can get,
in my opinion, because there are no springs to fail. One
disadvantage is that you cannot fill the weight pockets with
insulation because that would render the weights inoperable. The
small loss of heat through the weigh pockets is compensated by the
quality of the windows.

THE ZEN OF TOLERATING OTHERS' FOIBLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My older daughter, Laura, and I gave a talk on motherhood from
our two perspectives to the Weston Community Children's
Association. Both of us emphasized the importance of taking
responsibility for your own contribution to family problems. During
the question-and-answer period, one woman seemed to have run out of
patience with our emphasis on conscious parenting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't there a point where you can expect your kids to tolerate
your idiosyncrasies?'' she asked. ``I mean, why can't they think,
`Here's someone who's done a lot for me. I'm going to let the
little things go?'''
</P>
<P>
   I've been thinking about her question ever since. There's a
definite difference between hurtful or thoughtless behavior and the
common, exasperating quirks of personality we all display. Despite
the major life lessons I have mastered in the past half-century,
certain habits have me in their grip today as tightly as any falcon
ever grasped a rabbit.
</P>
<P>
   I have tried to change, I swear. I just haven't made a dent.
</P>
<P>
   Some of it is simple disorganization. I write messages on scraps
of paper. I can't seem to put Jack's mail in the same place every
day. I always think of one last thing to do before I leave the
house. I misplace the portable phone almost every time I use it. I
never completely empty my car of junk. Stuff like that.
</P>
<P>
   Some of it, however, involves interpersonal skills that I never
mastered in childhood.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it drives my husband crazy that I don't say
``hello'' to him when he walks in the door at night. It's not that
I ignore him. I simply start talking to him as if he's been home
all along, which, for some reason, he hates. He's learned to cope.
He puts both hands on my shoulders and interrupts me mid-sentence.
``Say, `hello,''' he says, and I say, ``Hello,'' and then we
continue the conversation. It seems like a tempest in a teapot to
me, but it bothers Jack a lot, so clearly I ought to break that
pattern, especially since I have nothing against one of
civilization's most welcoming social graces. It just doesn't occur
to me.
</P>
<P>
   Again. And again. And again.
</P>
<P>
   I'm following standard operating procedure from my family of
origin. Someone wasn't there; then they were. This didn't seem a
phenomenon worth mentioning. It seemed perfectly logical not to
stop what you were doing just because someone who hadn't been there
before entered the room. If you thought of something to say to
them, you spoke. It worked perfectly fine as far as I could see so
I kept doing it.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-nine years ago, however, I married a man who doesn't like
the feeling that his wife hasn't noticed his eight-hour absence.
We've been doing this little dance ever since, without either of us
understanding why we haven't been able to make what appears to be a
simple little adjustment. Last night, however, Jack read me the
following story:
</P>
<P>
   Philosopher Thomas Merton met a Zen novice who'd just spent a
year in a monastery. Merton asked the monk what he'd learned during
that period of time, expecting to hear of life-changing insights or
altered states of consciousness. Instead, the young monk replied
that during his year of spiritual training, he had learned to open
and close doors.
</P>
<P>
   I understand the magnitude of that task. The monk had to become
conscious of his own behavior, not just in the presence of his
master, but in the most commonplace of circumstances. Just think.
If you could become conscious of the act of opening or closing a
door, it would be a cinch to remember where you'd left the car
keys, or to be on time, or to notice who had entered a room and
needed a sign that his appearance made your heart jump just a
little. It's not a bad idea for all of us to be working toward that
state of enlightenment, which enables us to notice what we're doing
when we do it.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, however, being part of a family is a little
like taking a graduate course in learning to tolerate other
people's foibles. You either pass or go crazy. I believe the
curriculum goes as follows: 1.) Learn to say you're sorry; 2.) Be
sympathetic to those who are adversely affected by your behavior;
3.) Don't expect your good traits to excuse your lapses; 4.) Ask
for help or coaching when needed; and 5.) Be extremely grateful
when others, out of the goodness of their hearts, cut you a little
slack.
</P>
<P>
   Because the task of going from automatic pilot to conscious
awareness takes some of us a year.
</P>
<P>
   And the rest of us a lifetime.

ACCEPTING ANGER FORGES FAMILY STABILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I'm so ANGRY, I'm Angry, Angry, Angry. My mom says,
`You're hungry,' My dad says, `You're tired.' I AM NOT. I'm just
ANGRY.''
</P>
<P>
   With this straightforward beginning to her children's book,
``When I'm Angry'' (Golden Books, 1998), author and illustrator
Jane Aaron walks us through one of the most complicated of human
emotions, giving us a gift in the process. Not only does she give
us entry into our children's heads but she also gives young
children a graceful exit from a feeling that often overwhelms and
frightens them.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us have a tough time dealing with our child's anger;
we've had poor role models and don't handle our own anger well. The
rage of a 3- or 6- or 9-year-old can surprise, intimidate, or scare
us. We punish when we should set limits, personalize when we should
empathize. Short-term, this can momentarily derail a parent-child
relationship. A steady diet of it can cause a child to become more
and more aggressive or to turn his anger inward.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing to do is accept the angry feelings and not make
a child feel guilty or bad for having them,'' says clinical
psychologist Barbara Gardiner of New York. ``After all, anger is
one of many feelings, and all feelings are OK. What may not be OK
is how this feeling gets expressed.'' Gardiner is author of ``A
Parent's Guide to Anger,'' a companion to Aaron's book.
</P>
<P>
   Parent educator and author Nancy Samalin says a big mistake
parents make is taking the anger personally. A classic example is a
child who responds to a limit you set by shouting, ``I hate you!
You're the worst mother! I want to live with grandma.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you respond directly to that _ `How dare you talk to me
like that!' _ you join in the anger,'' she says. That gives her
more reason to be angry at you and puts you into a power struggle
unrelated to the original issue. A good response, says Samalin,
validates her feeling _ ``I know you're angry with me; angry
thoughts are OK'' _ but sticks to the point: ``You can't ride your
bike after dark.''
</P>
<P>
   What most helps an angry child is labeling the feeling and
helping him contain it and deal with it appropriately, says
psychologist Ann Evans of the Manville School of Judge Baker
Children's Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``A child's anger is scary to him,'' she says. ``When we respond
inappropriately, he feels even more out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   The first step to being helpful is getting control of our own
anger. Evans tells parents to take whatever time we need, seconds
to minutes, to make sure we are calm before we respond.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, it helps to know what's happening developmentally for
our child. ``That affects what anger looks like to us and feels
like to her,'' says developmental psychologist Richard Fabes, a
professor at Arizona State University who studies children's
emotions. For instance:
</P>
<P>
   _Infant. What typically makes him angry: Basic needs being
unmet. What he feels: Discomfort, frustration. What you see:
Intense crying, stiff body posture, flailing limbs.
</P>
<P>
   _Toddlers &AMP; preschoolers. What makes her angry: Not being able
to express herself, not getting what she wants. What she feels:
Rage and frustration. What you see: temper tantrums; angry words;
oppositional, destructive, or aggressive behavior: biting, hitting,
pinching, pulling the cat's tail.
</P>
<P>
   _School-age. What makes him angry: Interactions with peers,
violations of social expectations. What he feels: frustration, lack
of control, sense of unfairness. What you see: Meanness,
non-compliance, blaming others, bad language, anger that's out of
proportion to the offense, pouting, withdrawal, sadness.
</P>
<P>
   With young children, the difficulty is managing the child's
anger. As soon as she has language, Gardiner says to validate
feelings and remind a child to use her words: ``It's OK to have
angry feelings, but it's not OK to hit your brother. Use your words
to tell him not to knock down your tower.''
</P>
<P>
   By age 6 or 7, the words can be the vehicle of anger, as kids
hurl mean barbs at each other and you. Now the trick is to help
them channel it appropriately: ``If you're so angry with your
brother, why don't you write a note and slip it under his door?''
``How about if you each write a list of offenses and talk about
them?''
</P>
<P>
   With older children, the difficulty can be identifying the anger
and/or putting it in the right context. ``They aren't in touch with
their own feelings, so the anger they feel toward a peer can come
out at you or his sister, even though one has nothing to do with
the other,'' says Evans.
</P>
<P>
   A child who explodes over a minor transgression may have been
nursing an anger for weeks over a slight at school. A child who
blows up at your routine request has managed to contain his anger
at school but feels safe enough to let it out at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are red flags,'' says Evans. ``You need to do what he
can't do for himself: `I hear a lot of anger in your voice, more
than spilled milk deserves. It makes me wonder if something else is
bothering you?'' You won't get an answer at the moment, of course.
That's why Evans says it's important to have daily alone time with
each child, no matter how old they get.
</P>
<P>
   The older they are, the harder it is not to respond to their
surface anger, which can be fierce. When your child uses you as a
scapegoat, Samalin urges modeling self-respect: ``I can tell
something's bugging you and you're entitled to be upset, but I
can't let you take it out on me. When you feel calmer, I'm happy to
listen.'' Samalin is author of ``Love &AMP; Anger, the Parental
Dilemma'' (Penguin).
</P>
<P>
   Gardiner tells parents of 9- to 12-year-olds, ``Don't focus on
the rolling of the eyes, the slamming door, the mutterances under
his breath. If you can't make out the words, you don't know they
are disrespectful,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   If you can hear the words and they are disrespectful, don't let
it slide, however, ``No child feels good about himself if he gets
away with swearing at a parent,'' Gardiner says. Tell him: ``I know
you're angry, but you can't express it that way. You have a choice:
apologize or I'll come up with a consequence.''
</P>
<P>
   A common way for children to cope with anger is to blame it on
someone else: ``Timmy made me so angry!'' Evans says this can be
destructive. ``If he believes other people are responsible for his
feelings, he feels out of control,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The remedy is to give control back to him. Tell him, for
instance: ``Lots of information comes to us. How we respond is our
decision. We all have a choice about whether to let something make
us angry. It's up to you to decide something is a big deal or it
isn't, or that you need to react today or tomorrow, or not at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Any time a child is angry, you add fuel to the fire if you:
</P>
<P>
   _Negate feelings. ``That just makes him dig in his heels,'' says
Gardiner. Avoid saying, ``It's not worth being this angry because
someone cut in line.'' ``You're overreacting.''
</P>
<P>
   _Tell her what she already knows. Avoid saying, ``If you studied
more, you would have gotten a better grade.'' Samalin says,
``You're rubbing salt in the wound and giving her reason to focus
her anger on you instead of on how not to fail next time.''
Empathize and offer to problem-solve: ``That's a bummer. What can
you do differently next time?''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron's book is intended for preschoolers but it offers
universal truths that even school-age children can relate to.
``It's okay to be angry sometimes,'' the book ends, ``but it feels
good to stop being angry, too.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SUGGESTIONS FOR PARENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _Validating anger can defuse it. Ask a 3 to 5 year old to show
you how angry she is by drawing it or showing you with her toys.
Another strategy: Hold your hands farther and farther apart: ``Are
you this angry or this angry?'' Respond with respect: ``Wow, you
are really angry at your sister, aren't you?''
</P>
<P>
   _Temperament can cause some children to be quicker to anger than
others. When he's young, do whatever you can to control situations
so he isn't overwhelmed. By age 6, begin to help him identify
trigger points and learn coping strategies.
</P>
<P>
   _Help even young children identify how anger makes them feel:
``This anger makes me feel mean/powerful/like crying...''
</P>
<P>
   _Offer calming strategies: deep breaths, counting backward,
leaving a room, getting fresh air.
</P>
<P>
   _When you are angry at your child, be clear you're angry at the
behavior, not at him: ``That was a bad thing to do,'' instead of
``You're a bad boy.'' ``This is not about you being a good or bad
person. This is about an action.''
</P>
<P>
   _Keep anger from leading to power struggles by talking about
``house rules'': ``In this house, the rule is no hitting.'' _A
child whose anger pervades her life _ at home, school, with
friends, in sports _ may benefit from professional help.
</P>
<P>
   _If you're afraid to set appropriate limits because you're
afraid of your child's anger, you may need professional help.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; AFTERTHOUGHT _ Aaron and Gardiner's collaboration on ``When
I'm Angry'' is the first of four books in ``A Language of Parenting
Guide'' series (Golden Books).

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: A growing demand for apologies
 &HT;    (For release, Sept. 13, 1998)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The action word of the 90s would appear to be ``apology.''
Seemingly, everyone wants everyone else to apologize for something,
whether it happened yesterday, last month, last year, earlier in
the century or in previous centuries.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Bill Clinton, we have become a nation of
semanticists, first demanding he apologize to the people either for
his sexual adventure or his coverup of it, or for both, then
assessing whether or not his apology was apologetic enough.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Clinton, there seems no end in sight in demands for
apologies, even though whatever offense was committed likely never
will be forgiven, no matter the number of apologies.
</P>
<P>
   Holocaust survivors, who have demanded apologies for those who
committed crimes against them, now have taken to demanding
apologies from one another. In Florida, that state's Holocaust
survivors have taken umbrage with a Washington, D.C.-based
Holocaust group that trashed Florida's Insurance Commissioner for
supposedly giving state business to Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out he wasn't a party to it, and now the Florida
Holocaust survivors want the Washington, D.C. Holocaust group to
apologize.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton has shown us, apologies can come in many forms, most
of them flawed and leaving no one satisfied. Often the apology is
stilted and insincere.
</P>
<P>
   But the demands continue.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, despite yet another cease-fire in Northern Ireland,
the faction that took credit for the blast that killed 28 civilians
and wounded 330 more in Omagh had not yet apologized. And were they
to apologize, would that free them from their obligation to society
for the crime they committed?
</P>
<P>
   Jewish organizations still demand that the Roman Catholic Church
apologize for what Jews feel is the Church's acquiescence during
the Nazi era. But I thought the Church, through many gestures and
statements, had done that; why keep pressing?
</P>
<P>
   Often, in cocktail party conversation, I somehow get caught up
in discussions either about the Middle East or the American
treatment of the native population. That I am Jewish causes some to
ask why we Jews don't apologize for the slaughter at that South
Lebanese displaced person camp a decade or so ago. That I am an
American causes others to wonder why, when I write about native
Americans, I don't apologize for what we did to them.
</P>
<P>
   To those who identify me by religion, I respond that I am not an
Israeli and, therefore, cannot and will not apologize for actions
taken by someone else.
</P>
<P>
   To those who seem to hold me responsible for the awful treatment
of the native American, I respond that when the U.S. Cavalry was
doing all that slaughtering, my people were not in on it. Instead,
they were peasants in eastern Poland who were being thrashed with
clubs, run out of their homes and land and being murdered -- and
who's apologizing to me for that?
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Archbishop Desmond Tutu called on white South
Africans, as part of reconciliation, to apologize for their actions
under apartheid -- which is something I thought happened, in
effect, when South Africa eliminated apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   And even more recently, an apology from 20th Century Fox, the
makers of the movie ``How Stella Got Her Groove Back,'' was
demanded by angry Haitian-Americans over a reference in the film
tying Haiti to AIDS. When one thinks of all the other coarse,
undocumented statements made in movies today, imagine how many
apologies can be demanded.
</P>
<P>
   Insisting that 25-year-old Germans apologize for the foul deeds
of their grandfathers, that today's Americans apologize for what
yesterday's Americans did to the Indians, or what the Turks and
Armenians did to each other a century or so ago, just doesn't bring
closure, nor will it ever.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, an apology is an empty, forced gesture.
</P>
<P>
   Just listen to Clinton making his.

MASSIVES' FRICTION STRIKES MUSICAL SPARKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tension has its value and tension has its price.
</P>
<P>
   Massive Attack, the pioneering trip-hop trio from Bristol,
England, knows the tricky nature of this equation. The tension
within the group, the band members suggest, informed the creation
of their latest and best album, the dark yet danceable dreamscape
that is ``Mezzanine.'' The tension may also drive them apart after
this tour, just their third foray into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've almost outgrown each other in certain respects,'' says
singer/DJ Robert del Naja, a.k.a. 3-D. ``I wanted to take
`Mezzanine' in a direction which was a bit more aggressive and dark
and bit more real. It is that, but it's still compromised in
places.''
</P>
<P>
   It's Massive Attack's first full album in nearly five years and
the trio's most complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe on this album, the dreams have gotten a bit darker,''
muses DJ Andrew Vowles, a.k.a. Mushroom, in a separate telephone
interview. ``The music is darker because there is a lot of bad
friction in the band right now. We don't really get along with each
other anymore. We don't speak to each other. I mean, I sort of
speak to Gee (Grant Marshall, a.k.a. Daddy Gee) still, but ...
there's a few people who don't speak to one another. It's not a
nice situation in the band anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The three DJs, along with several others, got together in 1983
as the Wild Bunch in Bristol. They ran a portable sound system,
where dub reggae and jagged post-punk rock sounds collided and
swirled about, where new sounds were forged out of shifting
contexts. In 1987, Massive Attack crystallized _ Tricky was with
them briefly _ and the players began making their own music as well
as sampling others', mixing brooding, languid rhythms and echoed
effects, kicking off a genre that's since become known as trip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   This is a term very few people in the genre care for. ``I just
find it a silly journalistic term,'' says Vowles. ``It doesn't
really have much depth for me, just another fad that happened.''
</P>
<P>
   But if you were to put a name on the sound ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'd use the first term we called it, which was `lovers
hip-hop,''' says Vowles, borrowing the term from lovers reggae, a
gentle, swaying form of reggae. ``I don't know, I like to call it
soul; it's got a lot of soul music in it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Massives signed a record deal in 1990, and released their
debut album, ``Blue Lines,'' in the following year. Then came side
projects _ with U2 and Peter Gabriel, among others _ and in 1994
the ``Protection'' album. Each disc sold over a million copies
worldwide. Del Naja handled some of the male vocal leads, but the
group also frequently used Horace Andy and women such as Tracey
Thorn (Everything But the Girl) and, on the new disc, Liz Fraser
(ex-Cocteau Twins) and Sara Jay.
</P>
<P>
   America did not join the party, or did so in small doses, and in
the confines of clubland. America is the world's biggest pop
market, and its pop music patterns do not always, or often, mirror
those of the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   When del Naja phones in, the tour has just begun and he's in
Miami. ``It's weird starting off here,'' he says. ``There is so
much they are unfamiliar with. There's not exactly a strong hope
for our kind of music, you know.'' The reception is ``in contrast
to what we've been doing in the rest of the world. It's kind of
cool in a way, coming down to something. It's almost like starting
again and it's quite nice.''
</P>
<P>
   How important is America?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as important to us as it is to a lot of people in a
sense where they feel if they didn't break in America, they
failed,'' says del Naja. ``We've always done things at our own
pace. When we started out, we never knew where we'd end up; it was
all quite abstract.''
</P>
<P>
   Massive Attack dropped out of the opening-act slot on the
Verve's recent tour. ``They were just a bit mad, you know,'' says
Vowles, meaning crazed. ``Things didn't work out between the two
parties involved.''
</P>
<P>
   If del Naja is bemused by this tour, Vowles verges on being
miffed. ``I personally don't like touring,'' Vowles admits. ``I'd
rather be at home writing fresh material all the time. I can't
really pimp the old stuff.'' The studio, he suggests, is the
canvas; the stage is replication. Why then, especially in this
season of discontent, are they on the road?
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are we keeping it going? I don't know,'' says Vowles.
``The fallout came in making the album, so we have to see this
album through, the touring, the press and stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   He admits the tension aided the creative process: ``It always
has been that with the Massives, but sometimes that can just go
over the top and egos get a little too strong and people just end
up not having their views or musical visions heard or seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The theme of the album, if there is one, is ``about
relationships, the dynamics and dysfunction that we've fully
found,'' says del Naja. ``It's about life change.''
</P>
<P>
   Massive Attack likes a sense of spaciousness. They like
contrasting textures and seemingly wrongheaded genre clashes. They
like it sinuous, but jagged-edged. They want it to work as
foreground or background music. They give props to groups as
disparate as Pink Floyd (Vowles: ``one of the first rock/ &QC; 
soul bands, very intimate'') and Public Image, Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   On tour, the Massives are augmented by a band, including some of
the players featured on ``Mezzanine.'' Angelo Bruschini, formerly
of Blue Aeroplanes, is on guitar, Winston Blissett on bass, Pete
Lewinson on drums, Michael Timothy on keyboards. The female vocals
are handled by Debbie Mira _ Massive Attack says they don't use
sample vocals. As to the Massive Attack three, Vowles says, ``I
play keyboards and stuff and do a lot of drum programming. But we
all do sort of the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The live sound, del Naja says, will likely be more aggressive
than what's on disc. ``Even when you've got soul or hip-hop,'' he
says, live, ``it's more in your face because of the nature of
playing it so loud. We've got a live band, working with bass,
drums, guitar, keyboards, and vocals, and a lot of turntable work.
We get a lot of noise and energy going through it. ... We rearrange
the material, which makes it more interesting for us because you
get get bored of doing the same thing. I mean, I had trouble on the
last tour. I was getting sick of it. I was on autopilot. I think
'cause we're playing America, this will be exciting, coming back
with a different energy.''
</P>
<P>
   As to the presentation, del Naja says the Massives aren't ones
to jump around. ``We keep it pretty cool, let the music do the
speaking. We don't get involved with too much interaction with the
crowd on a personal level, crack jokes, or shout `How're y'all
doing?' ... It's all about working for ourselves in the studio,
trying to come out with the ideas that are in our heads. Anything
that comes with that _ sucess, travel, riches, whatever _ it's
because of your album.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The world is a duller place without the fountain that
Napoleon planned for Paris. Not that it would have been a great
fountain. It has none of the artistic coherence of the Apollo
fountain at Louis XIV's Versailles. It lacks the force of nature
that earns our own Old Faithful in Yellowstone National Park pride
of place in ``Splash and Spectacle,'' the Cooper-Hewitt Museum's
delightful exhibition of fountains through the ages. Napoleon's
fountain would not have consoled like the Ben Jonson lyric ``Slow,
slow, slow, fresh fount, keep time with my salt tears'' or inspired
like Maya Lin's civil rights memorial in which water commemorates
those who fought for the right to use public drinking fountains.
</P>
<P>
   But for wrong-headed audacity? Napoleon goes right to the top of
the list. What a pity the fountain was never built, this enormous
bronze elephant which the emperor hoped to cast from cannon
captured from the Spaniards. He had the site picked out, the Place
de la Bastille in Paris, where the guillotine worked overtime
during the French Revolution. A fountain would paper over the
recent bloody past, he felt. But why an elephant?
</P>
<P>
   Horses had been done. By Louis XIV, for one. He styled himself
le roi du soleil, or the Sun King, and he found his peer in Phoebus
Apollo, in Greek mythology the god of light who was associated with
the sun. As a sea-girt civilization the Greeks observed the sun
rising and setting in the water and fashioned a god to explain the
phenomenon. And what a nice story it is, radiant Apollo racing his
horse chariot across the arc of sky from dawn to dusk. The great
Apollo fountain at Versailles shows his four horses cresting the
waves.
</P>
<P>
   The elephant was something else. It was the largest of land
animals, exotic but useful in modern enterprise, all aspects that
spoke to Napoleon as he went imperial and global. His hero,
Alexander the Great, had first encountered battle elephants about
330 BCE when fighting Darius III, King of Persia. They must have
astonished Alexander and made him feel puny sitting on his little
horse, like a Jeep facing a tank. By gift or conquest, he began
acquiring elephants till he had 126 and could form them into a
battle line stretching two miles. Massed in war, H.H. Scullard says
in ``The Elephant in Greek and Roman Times,'' they were unsurpassed
for scaring opposing forces. Few people had seen an elephant. The
smell spooked horses, rendering the cavalry useless. Elephants
weren't the perfect war machine: they had the unfortunate habit of
turning tail and crushing their own troops. But you couldn't tell
that from Napoleon's fountain designed by architect Jacques
Celerier in 1810.
</P>
<P>
   This was an elephant of elephants, many times larger than life;
it defined ``elephantine.'' Illustrations show it dwarfing
pedestrians and riders who have gathered by its basin. Except from
a distance the eye would not have comprehended it. It was to be
harnessed in lacey gilt chain, which would have been dazzling
against the bronze hide, and on its back Celerier placed a golden
palaquin and on that a golden throne. Like a circular Niagara,
water falls and foams at the elephant's feet. So far so good. The
problem came with making the elephant part of the waterworks. One
version shows it standing demurely with trunk down. The water,
gushing from its trunk, has all the appeal of a fire hydrant, or a
runny nose. An elephant tossing water would have had the force of
nature and the artifice of fountains. It would seem Celerier had
broken the cardinal rule of a good fountain, and that is to make
the water issue naturally and inevitably but playfully. A far
better design job is the little blue neon elephant spraying himself
that you see in France as the logo for a car wash chain. But you
can understand Celerier's dilemma: a spraying elephant would have
drenched Napoleon sitting up there on the throne and a wet emperor
is not a happy emperor. Only a plaster cast of the elephant was
built. The next regime placed a simple column in the center of the
Place de la Bastille.
</P>
<P>
   The show at the Cooper-Hewitt, which is the Smithsonian
Institution's national museum of design, carries a further
subtitle: ``Water and Design From the Renaissance to the Present,''
and is the brainchild of the museum's curator of prints and
drawings, Marilyn Symmes. To publicize the show, the New Yorker
magazine got cartoonist William Steig to draw a fountain. Over a
lumpy cactus, two gunslingers shoot it out with water pistols. But
be forewarned: There are no working fountains in the Cooper-Hewitt
show, only photographs, engravings, models, a video. Go anyway
(it's on through Oct. 11) and help yourself to a walking map of New
York City fountains. Buy Symmes's excellent catalog with its
brilliant pictures (Rizzoli, $60). Go back home and commission a
fountain. Boston's City Hall Plaza would be better for a rumbling
cascade, stilly pool, or water jet.
</P>
<P>
   Showing a Boston fan of fountains (and elephants) around, Symmes
said she got the idea for the show when she noticed the vast amount
of printed matter devoted to ornamental waters and wondered why.
There was our ancestors's sheer fascination with hydraulic
mechanics. By the 16th century, engineers had the technology to
make water squirt, spray, ooze, suds, flow, bubble, mist, whip,
cascade, stream, and sprinkle as the fountain subject required. But
there was more to it than that, and Symmes has organized ``Splash
and Spectacle'' chronologically within a number of themes. If there
is a common thread in the catalog essays by Symmes and 11
contributors it is how political so many fountains were. Take the
Lion Fountain in the Generalife at Granada, Spain. The jets issuing
from the lions' mouths is nowhere near as impressive as the
engineering that brought water all the way from the mountains in
the 13th century. That feat made Arab science a force to reckon
with, and Symmes equates hydraulics with political power. Thus,
Louis XIV's Apollo and Napoleon's elephant are fountains of
propaganda, big men strutting. Peter the Great had fountains; popes
had fountains; also a Chinese emperor, though Chinese culture
frowned on forcing water upwards and as soon as he died, so did his
pagoda fountains. The fountain as spectacle at international
expositions is the nation-state version of this.
</P>
<P>
   The only Boston fountain in the show is the jet which drew
throngs to the Public Garden in October 1848 so people could see
with their own eyes that reservoir water had finally reached town.
There was a 101-gun salute. School children sang James Russell
Lowell's ode, which saw the jet as ``Cochituate's Ambassador''
bringing the gifts of ``long life, health, peace, and purity.''
Where indeed would we be without water to drink? The fountain as
refreshment was exemplary civic enterprise but highly moral as
well; as Symmes points out, those small fountains with tin drinking
cups hoped to banish demon drink from the daily diet.
</P>
<P>
   The past three decades have produced wonderful fountains. These
depend little on the sculpted figures which raised baroque
fountains to near art. The Igor Stravinsky fountain (1983) at the
Pompidou Center in Paris is a witty exception. Its folkish, goatish
figure hissing spray has the electrity of dance itself. Other
designers have preferred to look at the natural qualities of water
and rock. The Tanner Fountain (1984) at Harvard is water as mist.
The Lovejoy Plaza's fountain cascade (1966) in Portland, Ore., was
designed by Lawrence Halperin and Charles Moore as a spill of
rocks, a giant staircase that you can climb up and down.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Maya Lin was commissioned by the Southern Poverty Law
Center in Montgomery, Ala., to design a fountain, eight years after
the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., made her name.
In a speech by Martin Luther King Jr. evoking the Bible, she found
the words to incise on the black granite wall greeting visitors:
``...until justice rolls down like water and righteousness like a
mighty stream.'' The fountain itself is gentle and contemplative.
On a black granite ellipse are carved, as a ray, a chronology of 53
landmark events in the civil rights movement. Water flows over the
lettering. It is history read through the magnification of tears.

THE HEART OF THE WELFARE DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
SHIFTING THE COLOR LINE 
Race and the American Welfare State 
By Robert C. Lieberman 
Harvard University Press, 306 pp., $45  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, America's welfare debate has focused on gripping
tales of welfare cheats. Like the villains of old radio shows,
their lazy duplicity has been so vividly told that whether or not
these people are seen, they seem real. They are overburdened with
children; addicted to television; sometimes white, but
disproportionately black. Hence fixing welfare, one argument goes,
means taking stringent steps to put these people to work.
</P>
<P>
   But a true understanding of welfare, Robert C. Lieberman argues
in his provocative book ``Shifting the Color Line: Race and the
American Welfare State,'' requires a hard look not at stereotypes
but at history. Built into the early architecture of social welfare
programs, writes Lieberman, a professor of political science and
public affairs at Columbia University, are nasty political fights
and rigged compromises over race and class.
</P>
<P>
   To make his point, Lieberman plays bureaucratic archeologist,
unearthing and comparing the administrative structures of three
social welfare programs: Old-Age Insurance, Aid to Dependent
Children, and Unemployment Insurance. His tools include statistical
analysis of census data and state welfare records from the 1930s
through 1960, as well as a look at the prejudice that runs through
old congressional debates.
</P>
<P>
   By design and by default, Lieberman finds, the early rules and
practices of all three programs denied black Americans the sweeping
economic protections that Franklin Roosevelt envisioned. Political
compromises whittled away old-age and unemployment insurance plans.
To get these programs going, Roosevelt had to agree not to cover
agricultural and domestic workers _ jobs held by substantial
numbers of blacks. And Aid to Dependent Children was savaged by
local control _ what Lieberman calls parochial policies _ that made
it easy to deny benefits to eligible black families.
</P>
<P>
   The history, however, is not all ugly. Chapter 3 is a too-rarely
told account of remarkable government success: how Old-Age
Insurance (the best-known part of the Social Security Act)
transformed itself from a program that in 1935 largely excluded
blacks to one that is perhaps, writes Lieberman, ``the closest
thing to a race-blind social program the United States has ever
known.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Politically savvy administrators and a sophisticated public
relations effort prevailed. The program was liked because only
wage-earners who paid into it could draw from it. And as Lieberman
repeatedly points out, stating a central theme, the program's
national structure freed it from the disparities and abuses that
plagued locally run programs.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman then tackles a swamp of American policy-making: the
growth of Aid to Dependent Children. There are glimpses of what
could have been a fair and powerful program. States paid so-called
mother's pensions and the federal government sought to regularize
them. But racism was rampant. States clung to local control,
especially in the South, taking badly needed federal money but (as
Lieberman's statistics show) steering it away from black
recipients. From the 1940s through the 1960s, the political
manipulation of ADC grew. City politicians used it as patronage.
This fed the stereotype of blacks as welfare junkies, while mostly
ignoring the racial discrimination _ in education, hiring, and
other areas _ that undermined real economic progress.
</P>
<P>
   Even the civil rights movement is sadly overshadowed by
structurally unsound programs, Lieberman argues. The glorious
rhetoric of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and his contemporaries did
not change the prejudice-hardened structures of welfare programs.
</P>
<P>
   But Lieberman's conclusion contains compelling advice: Shun
programs that claim to help everyone, but that exclude black
citizens; expand programs _ daycare, job training _ that help
everyone but disproportionately benefit poor black Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shifting the Color Line,'' is an enlightening look at
America's failure to ask, without racist or political motives, how
poor people can make progress. It is also, however, a book policy
wonks will love but casual readers may find difficult. Lieberman
uses dry language and detailed statistical explanations. For the
determined reader, however, the book is an intense history course
that bypasses decades of deceptive rhetoric to get to the core
issues of the welfare debate.

THE HIGH PRICE   OF SMOKED SALMON   ON SALE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Here's another true supermarket adventure.
</P>
<P>
   A woman is keeping an eye on the register while the cashier
rings up her order.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait,'' the woman says, ``that smoked salmon is on sale for
$6.99.''
</P>
<P>
   The cashier, a woman, 50ish, says, ``The computer says it's
$11.99.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's a big sign. It's on sale for $6.99.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll call the manager,'' the cashier says.
</P>
<P>
   The woman glances at the man waiting in line behind her. He does
not look happy.
</P>
<P>
   The manager arrives. The cashier fills him in. ``It's only the
Ducktrap River smoked salmon that's on sale,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The woman points to the package, emblazoned with the words
``Ducktrap River.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' says manager. ``There's been a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' the woman says. ``I wouldn't have bought
for $11.99.''
</P>
<P>
   The manager hesitates for a moment, then turns to the cashier.
``Give it to her,'' he says, grudgingly. He stalks off.
</P>
<P>
   The cashier rings in a deduction, $4.
</P>
<P>
   The woman hesitates for a moment. Should she say something? It's
only a dollar. But she's come this far, why not go all the way?
``Wait a minute,'' she says. ``That's a $5 deduction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' says the cashier. She seems exasperated. She holds up
her fingers and slowly, patronizingly, begins counting. ``$11.99,
$10.99, $9.99 ..'' Suddenly she stops counting and holds up four
fingers. ``See? Four.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' the woman says. She counts off on her own fingers.
``$10.99, $$9.99, $8.99, $7.99, $6.99. That's five.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' says the cashier. Again she counts on her fingers.
``$11.99, $10.99, $9.99 ... That's four.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman holds up her own hand and counts. ``Five. Think of it
as $12 minus $7. It should be $5 off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' the cashier says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call the manager,'' says the woman. The man waiting in line
behind her looks even less happy than he did before. He looks as
though he would gladly strangle her, and maybe the cashier too. She
doesn't even want the stupid smoked salmon, but she has people
coming for dinner and it seemed like a good deal. Smoked salmon.
Who is she trying to impress? She thinks about tossing it aside, or
throwing it at the cashier. All this over a lousy dollar, but it's
the priciple ...
</P>
<P>
   The manager returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``$11.99 minus $6.99 is five dollars,'' the woman says.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,' the cashier says. ``Four dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   The manager looks bewildered.
</P>
<P>
   The cashier starts counting her fingers again. ``$11.99, $10.99
...''
</P>
<P>
   The woman reaches over the counter, grabs the upraised hand and
counts on the cashier's fingers: ``$10.99, $9.99, $8.99, $7.99,
$6.99. That's five dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   The cashier, a frightened look in her eyes, jerks her hand away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give it to her,'' says the manager in a tone that suggests
he's accustomed to dealing with lunatics.
</P>
<P>
   Am I crazy? the woman wonders. She remembers working as a
waitress at the International House of Pancakes, long before she'd
ever heard of smoked salmon, long before computers. She remembers
toting up checks. She'd add and subtract, sometimes even multiply,
in her head. She never even used her fingers. It wasn't that hard,
was it?

HE'LL TAKE THE BLAME

<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Willie McGinest was three parts angry and
one part contrite.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can do is take all this stuff in, all the articles in,
all the comments about me in,'' said the Patriots defensive end,
``and just save that up and let that build and unleash all that
against Indianapolis.''
</P>
<P>
   McGinest had been chastised by media, fans, and his head coach
since he committed two costsly penalties in Monday's 27-21
season-opening loss at Denver, both penalties aiding Broncos
touchdown drives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't call it a mistake,'' said McGinest. ``I was just
trying to help my team.''
</P>
<P>
   In a surreal scene late Wednesday afternoon, McGinest emerged
from the Patriots' administration building during a fire alarm that
brought two Foxborough Fire Department trucks to the scene and
owner Bob Kraft, Carroll, his assistants, and several players out
to the front steps. Then McGinest let off some fire of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had 65 plays in the game and I made two mistakes that were
critical to the game,'' he said. ``There were a lot of mistakes
made on the field the other night, and I had a
(roughing-the-passer) call that was probably questionable. I jumped
offsides on (a punt); it happens to a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, McGinest went on, ``there were a lot of mistakes made
all over the field from a lot of different people. But being in the
position where I am, being one of the guys who is more outspoken on
the team, one of the leaders on the defense, and one of the players
that people recognize a little bit more, there's a lot more
emphasis when I make a mistake or mess up.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention being paid $25 million over five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my five years here, that's the most penalties I ever got in
a game that changed the game around,'' said McGinest. ``I read a
lot of articles where they say that might have changed the game ...
but two plays that changed the whole game around? So I have to step
up and take responsibility, which I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   McGinest promised that he ``wouldn't back away from it. I mean,
I'm not going to slow down and not be aggressive. I'm going to go
after the quarterback. I'm still going to try and get every edge I
can to get off the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriot defense on the Denver punt when McGinest was ruled
offside ``was the `punt-safe' in case they tried to go for (a first
down on fourth and 3),'' he said. ``Their center jerked the ball
around, but the ref called me, so I got to take responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   McGinest is not a regular on the punt return team and was in an
unfamiliar situation when the Denver snapper wiggled the ball
before sending it back to the punter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really help the team with my penalties,'' McGinest
said as the fire trucks drove away. ``I'm man enough to step up and
say that, that it was my fault. It'll get better.''

CARROLL WEIGHS PATRIOTS' ERRORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Mistakes killed the Patriots Monday night in
Denver, some mental blunders, some overanxious moves, some physical
errors that added up to a 27-21 loss. It was the universal analysis
_ players, fans, and New England's coaches, most of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``You make them know what is acceptable and what isn't,'' said
head coach Pete Carroll when asked about his approach to correcting
mistakes. ``You make the points, you show them the logic, and you
drill them on the things that need to be drilled.''
</P>
<P>
   Some coaches, of course, use a biting tongue to harangue
players. Others show errant players to the bench or the highway.
Others review film. All talk. Many, if not all, coaches use all of
the above.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the players need to be kicked in the butt and
sometimes you need to get them to sit down and make sense to
them,'' said Carroll. ``You do all those things _ everything that
we can think of _ to make those points to the players on the
critical issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, said Carroll, he tries ``everything you can ever think
of'' to cure players of their erring ways. ``Whether it's me
counseling the guy or me screaming at the guy. Either way, we're
trying to get the job done with that player.''
</P>
<P>
   What he finds most fruitful in reducing mistakes, said Carroll,
is pointing out to the players how their actions on a particular
play affected the game, affected a drive, affected momentum,
affected why the team won or lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally believe that when players realize the importance
of the decisions they make _ that is, when they recognize it _ it
is best learned,'' said the coach. ``We really try to make sense to
them how it impacts the game, and it was so obvious (Monday), and
hopefully, we'll benefit from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Coaches, of course, are not alone in their myriad ways of
dealing with mistakes. Parents, teachers, judges, and wardens all
have sundry ways of dealing with the errant.
</P>
<P>
   So the next obvious question to Carroll was: How do you deal
with Willie McGinest, a veteran, a highly paid veteran at that, who
made two costly blunders against the Broncos _ being offside on a
punt and roughing the passer _ and one other penalty that was not
accepted by Denver?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we don't ignore it,'' said Carroll when it was suggested
to him that McGinest might learn his lesson on his own. ``We have
to address it ... no matter what the guy's contract is. We have
done that and we will continue to do that, and it's not like once
you get it, you get it. It's an ongoing process.''
</P>
<P>
   McGinest, said Carroll, ``is like anybody else on the club in
that you've got to make the point to him and see progress being
made. This guy loves our team, this guy loves playing to win, and
he took this very hard that he made a mistake that cost us. And
he's very remorseful for it.''
</P>
<P>
   That remorse, said Carroll, can be instructive enough. Not only
McGinest's blunders, ``but I know Chad Eaton will never have
another problem on field goal protection teams, either. And I know
(Todd) Rucci won't, either (the Broncos blocked a Patriot field
goal apparently because Eaton moved to help Rucci on his blocking
assignment). But the lesson is that they learned it the hard way.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he has brought these points home to McGinest and
others, Carroll said, ``Absolutely, we did. We addressed every one
of these issues. And we'll continue to do it. It's an ongoing
process. It isn't like it's done. That's the way you have to go
about teaching and coaching.''
</P>
<P>
   McGinest has not been a regular on the Patriot punt return
teams, and that fact alone may have accounted for his being offside
when Denver kicked on fourth and 3. ``The ball was being jerked
around (by the snapper), and Willie just saw the ball being
moved,'' said veteran defensive lineman Henry Thomas. ``It's a
little different between being in on regular defense and on special
teams because on special teams, centers have a little more leeway
of moving the ball before it's snapped.''
</P>
<P>
   McGinest saw the ball being jiggled and reacted as if it were a
first-and-10 situation. ``When you play defense, when that ball
wiggles, we go,'' said Thomas. ``We're triggered that way, but
Willie didn't realize the adjustment of the ball (is allowed on a
punt).''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriot coaches, said Thomas, came into Wednesday's meetings
``and kind of beat us over the head about mistakes. But the guys
who make mistakes already know how big it is. They won't make them
again. Coaches say, `You see how big a mistake it is and how it
hurt the team?' So when one guy makes a mistake, we all have to
learn from it.''

   The menu was probably a good indication that the stock market
had reached a peak. Many of the guests didn't need the clue.
</P>
<P>
   The event was an annual midsummer get-together of about 30
longtime investment pros, venture capitalists, and big-money
business executives hosted by Jerry Jordan, head of Hellman Jordan
Management Co., at his Cape Cod, Mass. summer home near the tony
harbor of Padanarum.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Ferri of Matrix Partners, the Waltham, Mass. venture
capital firm, joked that they used to pick up bread and bologna on
the way to Jordan's house when the informal gatherings started more
than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   The guest list is bigger and more impressive these days. Byron
Wein, chief investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter;
Joseph McNay of Essex Investment Management; William Hicks of
Wellington Management Co.; and Tom Stemberg, the chief executive of
Staples Inc., were also among the visitors.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't eating any bologna. This summer's table featured
lobster and an oyster bar. ``It was clear by the elaborate
preparation it was the market top,'' Ferri says now.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the money managers and strategists visiting this summer
had already felt that way. The bad news: Those summertime bears
have not done an about-face, even though the Dow Jones industrial
average dropped nearly 1,500 points in the meantime. Some may not
be quite so pessimistic today with so much steam taken out of the
market, but any shift is toward a wait-and-see approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do see the market through last week as being extremely
oversold,'' said McNay. ``But I think you have to continue to run
cautiously. Until we have some of the world's problems really dealt
with, there's still risk in the system.''
</P>
<P>
   By McNay's account, not everyone gathering over the summer was
making gloomy forecasts. ``But there wasn't any rampant bullishness
there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was bearish enough at his own event to declare it the top
of the market. He turned out to be exactly correct. The two-day
event on July 17-18 took place as the Dow Jones industrial average
and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 both reached all-time highs. The Dow
has since lost 15.5 percent of its value and the S&AMP;P 500 has sunk
by 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's assessment now: ``I think there is more to come on the
downside.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, whose firm manages $1.8 billion, said he moved most of
his investment money into cash a week after the summer weekend
event and will probably keep it there until late next month.
</P>
<P>
   Like McNay, Jordan believes the heavy selling pressure that
stocks have been under make it risky to bet on further short-term
declines by selling stocks short in his hedge funds. Short sellers,
betting that a stock will decline, sell borrowed shares and hope to
repay the loan later with cheaper shares.
</P>
<P>
   McNay's Essex Management, which runs about $4.1 billion in
conventional private accounts and $400 million in hedge funds that
can short stocks, is also moving cautiously.
</P>
<P>
   McNay said his firm's hedge funds had invested 50 to 85 percent
of their money in short positions earlier in the summer, at least
twice their normal proportion. Most of the funds have since trimmed
their shorts. Some other Essex funds have moved about 20 percent of
their money into cash.
</P>
<P>
   Performance at publicly tracked institutional funds managed by
Hellman Jordan and Essex had been mixed leading up to the stock
market correction.
</P>
<P>
   The Hellman Jordan fund was among the top 10 percent of its
peers in the first quarter, but its large-stock growth accounts
were in the bottom 10 percent, according to the Pensions &AMP;
Investments Performance Evaluation Reports. Three types of Essex
accounts tracked by PIPER were ranked above average to middle of
the road through the first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Ferri, the venture capitalist, is another stock market bear. He
may not make his daily living in the market, but venture capital
firms usually cash out of their investments when companies go
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pessimistic even now,'' he said. ``The market has
corrected some, but there are fundamental problems in the world
that haven't started to affect us in a material way. I think it
will.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Red Herring
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR; The New England Funds have named marketing executive Bruce Speca
to replace Henry Schmelzer as its president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Schmelzer, a 26-year veteran of the company, said he was leaving
to pursue other interests.
</P>
<P>
   The New England Funds, a family of 22 funds with $7 billion
under management, has struggled to attract new money from
customers. Sales of new shares have roughly equaled redemptions at
the firm since 1996.

SHULA, OLD GUARD BOTH WERE LOSERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don Shula nearly made a comeback in Cleveland, but once again,
the so-called Old Guard in the National Football League couldn't
win the battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the owners were for Chuck Dolan getting the team
because that meant Shula would be back,'' said one NFL owner in the
Chicago hotel room Tuesday when the expansion Cleveland Browns
franchise was awarded for 1999 to Al Lerner, going for the highest
price ever for an American sports team, $530 million. ``They had
enough votes to stop Al Lerner from getting the team, but they
couldn't get enough votes to get Dolan and Shula in, so they had to
give it up.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by the NFL that billionaire Lerner had
purchased the Browns was bland. But the action in the meeting room
was far from that. There was a lot of emotion and feeling for
Shula, the great Hall of Fame coach of the Miami Dolphins who has
been out of the league loop since he retired three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Shula has been a longtime favorite of the Old Guard, consisting
of owners Well Mara, Giants; Leon Hess, Jets; Ralph Wilson,
Buffalo; Art Modell, Baltimore; Bill Bidwill, Arizona; Mike Brown,
Cincinnati; and a few more they recruited for this battle.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years ago, when Pete Rozelle retired, this group formed the
core of supporters for the candidacy of the late Jim Finks as
commissioner. They did not have their way, and Paul Tagliabue
prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday's meeting, they came in supporting Dolan, even though
his bid of $500 million was surpassed by Lerner's.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, there were seven suitors for the Cleveland franchise.
A bidding process was set up, and Lerner and Dolan were the final
two.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, both were asked for their final bids.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday morning, Dolan wanted another chance to raise his
bid, and this was not allowed. The NFL expansion committee said the
bidding stopped at midnight the night before. At one point during
the argument, with all 30 owners in the room, Modell said he
thought that Dolan, if prodded, would raise his bid to $600
million. However, the committee, supported by Tagliabue, said this
was not the way the process was set up.
</P>
<P>
   By league rule, 23 owners needed to vote in favor of the new
owner.
</P>
<P>
   On the first ballot, Lerner got 19 votes, Dolan nine, with two
teams abstaining, Oakland and St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   After three ballots, Lerner still did not have enough votes. The
meeting was adjourned for 90 minutes, and members of the expansion
committee worked the room.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona, St. Louis, Washington, and Miami switched, so it
appeared Lerner was over the top. But on the fourth ballot, Malcolm
Glazer of Tampa switched to Dolan, leaving Lerner one vote shot.
</P>
<P>
   However, Patriots owner Bob Kraft, went to Glazer and reportedly
got him to switch back to Lerner, giving him the edge he needed.
When the vote was tallied, Modell moved to make it unanimous, even
though he had been the biggest supporter of the Dolan-Shula ticket
and reportedly had been the catalyst who got the Old Guard to fight
one more battle. Al Davis of Oakland abstained, reportedly feeling
that the process was flawed, but if needed, he was ready to vote
for Shula and Dolan.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Patriots fans weren't impressed with the team's
performance in the 27-21 loss at Denver Monday night, but two of
the best minds in the league were: Mike Shanahan, the Broncos'
terrific coach, and Colts general manager Bill Polian, whose team
will be in Foxborough Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, after breaking down the tape of the game, Shanahan
said, ``Defensively, the Patriots are as good as any team we will
play. Their front seven is as good as any in the league against the
run. Their two safeties do a good job supporting the run. Ty Law is
a heck of a player at corner. Steve Sidwell is one of the toughest
guys (defensive coordinators) in the league to game-plan against.
They did a better job of stopping our running game (particularly
Terrell Davis) than any other team has done in the last two years.
The game was played with playoff intensity by both teams. There
wasn't a turnover on either side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Ernie (Zampese) had a good offensive game plan for
them. His pass-protection schemes were excellent and gave us some
problems. Our team played hard. We had a big mistake that let them
get a big play (a 55-yard completion to Shawn Jefferson, setting up
a New England touchdown). We had a two-deep zone called, and Steve
Atwater thought we were in three-deep. This let Jefferson get deep
all alone. Funny thing is that Steve told (Tyrone) Braxton what the
right call was and then forgot himself. Those things happen
sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``John (Elway) had a big game for us. He is so comfortable with
the offense now that he knows what to do in all situations. Some of
the best plays he made in that game were balls he threw away on
purpose because we didn't have anyone open. Instead of taking a
sack, he got the ball out of there and went on to the next play.''
</P>
<P>
   Polian said, ``I haven't seen every team in the league so far
this season, but of the ones I have seen, New England has the most
complete team. Almost every team has holes. I don't see any in New
England. They have the best athletes of any team in our division.
They have depth. I love their special teams. When you have (punter
Tom) Tupa; (Adam) Vinatieri when he is kicking well; Derrick
Cullors, who I think is as good as anyone in the league (returning
kickoffs); and Larry Whigham, a Pro Bowl player, all on special
teams, then you have a great group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not that good yet. Offensively, we are OK. We played
decent on offense against Miami (in a 24-15 loss) last week.
Defensively, we put (Karim) Abdul-Jabbar in the Hall of Fame. We
couldn't stop him. We have to find a way to stop the run. We played
hard against Miami, but it just wasn't good enough.''

THERE ARE NO PATRIOTS SURPRISES, UNFORTUNATELY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ They were not embarrassed. There was no nationally
televised humiliation this time, and the game left plenty of hope
for the 1998 Patriot season. The summary shows that Drew Bledsoe
played well and the Patriots matched the Broncos yard for yard.
</P>
<P>
   But once again, the Patriots could not pull off an upset.
Whatever else you say about these Pats of the last three seasons,
with the possible exception of last year's game at Jacksonville,
they never win a game they are not supposed to win. They generally
trash the bad teams (look out, Tennessee), but they can't beat the
big boys.
</P>
<P>
   You can look at their 1998 schedule and predict the wins and
losses. They'll kill the Oilers, Saints, Colts (twice), Falcons,
Bills (twice), and Rams. They'll go 2-2 against the Dolphins and
Jets. And they'll most probably lose to the Steelers, 49ers, and
Chiefs. It adds up to 10-6 or 11-5 if they manage a rare upset.
Then they'll have the easy first-round playoff game, then go to
Denver, Kansas City, Pittsburgh, or Jacksonville and get smoked on
the road in the second round and we'll all wonder if Drew Bledsoe
can win a big game.
</P>
<P>
   There you go, sports fans. One game down and nothing has
changed. We can already predict their fate. Why not just
fast-forward to early January and let the real games begin?
</P>
<P>
   There was an air about the Broncos Monday night that was
somewhat deflating. Denver simply knew it could handle New England.
Even though the Patriots played better than in past games against
the Broncos, let's not forget that it was 17-0 in the first half
and 27-13 with two minutes to play before winding up 27-21. The
game was only close statistically.
</P>
<P>
   The litany of Patriot mistakes is almost too lengthy to list.
Ill-timed penalties, poor communication, and missed assignments
conspired to beat New England on a night when the Patriots
showcased a ton of football talent.
</P>
<P>
   But imagine Bledsoe, now in his sixth season, not ready for
crowd noise? Imagine burning all your second-half timeouts in the
first nine minutes of the third quarter? Imagine $25 million dollar
man Willie McGinest (two offsides and a roughing-the-passer
penalty) getting benched late in the game?
</P>
<P>
   Imagine Pete Carroll, in his second season, after five
exhibition games, telling us, ``We did have some trouble
communicating. The noise did affect us and some of our
communications. They weren't all Bledsoe's fault. Sometimes we were
late with the calls''?
</P>
<P>
   When he was asked to recount the three burned timeouts, Bledsoe
said, ``I don't remember what they were. I really don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had a lot to do with the noise. I didn't hear the call, had
to ask for it to be repeated, and by then, it was too late. It's
something we'll have to address when we play in loud places.''
</P>
<P>
   Does this sound like a six-year veteran who has already
quarterbacked three playoff teams and played in the Super Bowl?
Maybe they should play some Nine Inch Nails over the loudspeakers
when the Pats practice.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll, in typical fashion, had words of consolation and
encouragement for Bledsoe and Terry Glenn (5 catches, 71 yards) in
the losers' locker room. He also gave us the NFL coachspeak when he
refused to acknowledge the obvious and anoint rookie Robert Edwards
as his starting running back. The coach said he'd have to check the
films. It is difficult to make a case for this strange allegiance
to Sedrick Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   The Pats' locker room was quiet but not torn apart like it was
after their playoff loss in Pittsburgh last season. A lot of good
things happened in Denver Monday night (facing eight-man fronts,
Terrell Davis ran for only 75 yards on 22 carries), and no one
really expected the Patriots to beat the Super Bowl champs on the
road.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran defensive back Willie Clay said, ``When you play against
a team like Denver, you can't afford those kinds of mistakes. I
can't answer why, but we can learn from it. I feel good about our
team and what we can do. We just have to get rid of some of the
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have a wealth of talent. It's enough to steamroll
the NFL weaklings. But they've got too many veterans to be making
so many rookie mistakes against the NFL elite.

WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH BEING NICE? 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEN ALEXANDER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ What must the rest of the world think of us? No,
I don't mean the Bill-Monica mess, I mean the latest miniflap in
the San Francisco area about Safeway courtesy clerks being too
nice.
</P>
<P>
   If you talk to people who shop, especially in department stores,
you find their main complaint is the lack of anybody to wait on
them _ or else the grudging, disinterested treatment when a clerk
finally appears.
</P>
<P>
   Now a supermarket has adopted the be-nice-to-customers policy
and what do we get? ``I hate to be accosted in the store aisles by
somebody wanting to be friendly when I just want to shop'' _ this
is a quote from one man from Walnut Creek.
</P>
<P>
   ``They go too much out of their way to be friendly and
accommodating; it gets in the way of shopping'' _ another customer.
</P>
<P>
   These are people I don't want to know. If shopping is such an
intense operation that a simple ``Thanks, I'm doing fine'' upsets
the search for cheaper tofu, the shopper is either basically
unhappy, has a backache or subscribes to that Kingston Trio line in
The Merry Minuet ``... an' I don' like anybody very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Some clerks have said that smiling and being friendly have
elicited unwanted advances from a few male customers. Weirdos we
will always have with us. Suppressing an attempt at being pleasant
won't stop their ugly behavior. If accosted in the parking lot, a
loud scream or a well-aimed kick will free the accostee from
further annoyance.
</P>
<P>
   A newspaper _ which shall remain unnamed _ referring to
Safeway's policy of requiring extra efforts at courtesy by the
employees, had the incredible stupidity to say in an editorial
that, while the attempt to increase the nice quotient is laudable,
``They may have gone too far.''
</P>
<P>
   In what way? The editorial quotes the dastardly demands that
``workers smile, greet the customer, make eye contact, suggest good
buys, thank the customer by name and open the door.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, I've never been so insulted in my life! Any one of those
moves will send me to the neighboring market where the workers
frown, ignore me, avoid my gaze, recommend overpriced goods, do not
thank me and let me open the door with my rear end when my arms are
full of groceries.
</P>
<P>
   I have been shopping at my neighborhood Safeway, and the two
stores that preceded it, for 46 years. The attitude of the workers
is the most noticeable facet of any retail establishment; increased
pleasantness, even if a bit overdone, means more business. I know
several courtesy clerks by name and most of the rest by sight.
</P>
<P>
   They are unfailingly nice, efficient, willing to banter and make
the pass through the checkout line a happy experience.
</P>
<P>
   These days, road rage, assaults, belligerent middle finger
flip-offs and shouting matches are common, everyday experiences,
noted in the media only when enough blood flows to summon a camera.
We should be thankful there's a large company that puts a premium
on niceness _ on that rarest of commodities, courtesy.

ABORTION ISSUE PLAGUES REPUBLICAN IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Attorney General Dan Lungren's position on
abortion is taking a more prominent role in the gubernatorial
campaign despite his efforts to downplay his anti-abortion views.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren, the Republican nominee for governor, often says only
reporters and political foes care about the issue, yet a Field Poll
released Wednesday indicates that two-thirds of the California
voters survey disagree with his view that new laws are needed to
restrict abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren has put the issue into the spotlight again by inviting
New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman _ among the most vocal
pro-choice Republicans _ to help him raise money.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren has tried to soften his abortion stance, fearing that a
``pro-life'' label will hurt his chances to attract moderate
voters, especially women.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, he has shifted away from earlier positions, most
notably his previous opposition to abortion in cases of rape and
incest.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, the Democratic candidate for governor, has
intensified his criticism of Lungren's anti-abortion views. At a
Labor Day picnic focused on labor issues, Davis devoted one-third
of his speech to the abortion, pointing out that as a congressman
Lungren had voted 15 times to deny the procedure to victims of rape
and incest.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren's record shows he has shifted his position twice on
abortion in cases of rape and incest.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Lungren co-sponsored the Human Life Amendment, a
constitutional measure to ban all abortions, including pregnancies
stemming from rape or incest. The bill made an exception in cases
where the mother's life was in danger.
</P>
<P>
   But in a 1990 radio appearance when he was as candidate for
attorney general, Lungren expressed a different view. He said he
would support the right to an abortion in cases of rape and incest
because of society's lack of support for crime victims.
</P>
<P>
   His opponent at the time, San Francisco District Attorney Arlo
Smith, blasted Lungren for waffling on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has changed his views on abortion to save the life of his
political career and only for that reason,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   As the state co-chairman of the platform committee at the
Republican National Convention two years ago, Lungren supported the
party's position calling for a constitutional ban on all abortions,
even in cases of rape or incest.
</P>
<P>
   But in current campaign literature, he says he supports a
woman's right to abortion in cases of rape and incest.
</P>
<P>
   ``His strategy is pretty obvious,'' said Ann Crigler, director
of the Jesse Unruh School of Politics at the University of Southern
California. ``The latest polls show that a majority of Californians
favor current abortion policies or even more liberal abortion
policies. And he wants to win votes.''
</P>
<P>
   A Field Poll released Wednesday of 434 registered voters found
that 46 percent said they wanted no change in the state's abortion
laws, while 20 percent said abortions should be made easier to
obtain. Only 29 percent said they would favor stricter abortion
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who did not want abortion law changes, 55 percent
said they supported Davis, while 34 percent said they favored
Lungren. Of those who indicated they supported stricter laws, 56
percent were for Lungren, while 33 percent said they favored Davis.
</P>
<P>
   But 68 percent of those polled said they would support requiring
teen-agers under 18 to get parental consent for an abortion.
Lungren supports legislation to require parental consent, while
Davis opposes it. The state Supreme Court overturned California's
parental consent law last year.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he supported the Human Life Amendment in Congress,
Lungren explained at a debate last month that he was trying to
provoke discussion over abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're asking, `Did I engage in debate as to whether or not
it's a great thing to have millions of abortions,' you're
absolutely right,'' Lungren said.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren's aides maintain he has always recognized an exception
for rape and incest, but has at times cast procedural votes for
bills to outlaw abortions to move the legislation to the Senate for
debate.
</P>
<P>
   Davis spokesman Michael Bustamante said Lungren had voted
repeatedly to deny abortions to victims of rape and incest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan Lungren says one thing and does another on the issue of
choice,'' Bustamante said.
</P>

<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lungren, a Catholic, often says his religious faith has shaped
his personal views on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the San Francisco Examiner editorial board
last week, the issue was put in that personal context. Lungren was
asked what he would do if a loved one were raped. He said he would
urge her to seek medical attention, including a procedure to scrape
the uterus ``for the purpose of protecting the woman from any
infection.''
</P>
<P>
   The procedure, which he recommended for a woman within 18 hours
to two days of the rape or incest, is called a D-and-C, or dilation
and curettage. It is minor surgery that involves dilating the
cervix and inserting a spoon-shaped instrument to scrape the lining
of the uterus.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren's suggested medical procedure shocked some doctors, who
said the surgery is an outdated and potentially dangerous way to
end a pregnancy. Doctors prescribe antibiotics as a way to fight
infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's completely misinformed,'' said Dr. Karen Beckerman, an
obstetrician at San Francisco General Hospital, whose specialty is
maternal fetal medicine. ``(The procedure) does not prevent
infection. In fact, it could potentially expose a woman to a
greater risk of infection.''
</P>
<P>
   The procedure was once used for abortions but has been replaced
by hormonal treatments, such as morning-after pills, or a procedure
in which the fetus is sucked from the uterus using a tube.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren's aides explained his reference to the medical procedure
by saying he was simply answering a question about his personal
advice for a loved one, not making a policy statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's never professed to be a doctor,'' said Bob Brown, a
Lungren spokesman. ``He's not running for surgeon general.
Obviously, he would defer to the best medical advice of doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   Lungren justified the procedure, noting that a D-and-C has
``never been legally called an abortion, or morally called an
abortion as far as I can tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Lungren has been put in a tough spot by hard-line anti-abortion
rights foes who have pushed for a complete ban on abortion, said
John Pitney Jr., a former deputy director of the Republican
National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many times the pro-life forces have used as their vehicle the
harsher version of a pro-life proposal that puts people like
Lungren in a difficult position,'' Pitney said.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Carroll, legislative analyst for the California ProLife
Council, said she did not believe Lungren is softening his stance,
merely reflecting the fact that a ban on abortions in cases of rape
or incest isn't politically feasible now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a recognition of what is possible,'' Carroll said.

   SCI-ECOLI-CATTLE (Undated) _ Microbiologists at Cornell have
found a way to virtually rid cattle of harmful strains of E. coli
bacteria, among them the bacteria that have caused scores of deaths
and sickened thousands who ate undercooked hamburgers. Their
studies, described in today's issue of the journal Science,
demonstrated that the grain-based feedlot diet usually fed to
cattle before slaughter fosters the growth of E. coli bacteria.
They found that if cattle are switched to a diet of hay or fresh
grass for just five days before slaughter, the possibility of
infection could be greatly reduced. By Jane E. Brody.

   RUSSIA-CRISIS _ MOSCOW _ Ending Russia's debilitating political

nominating Foreign Minister Yvegeny Primakov as prime minister. The
move was hailed by the Communist-led Duma, which had been ready to
reject Viktor Chernomyrdin for a third time and confront Yeltsin
with impeachment proceedings. Now, Primakov must assemble a

ads to target at the dairy state, a confluence of issue advocacy
spending that could make Wisconsin the most heavily targeted state
in the country. Sen. Russ Feingold (D-Wis.) may be the reason for
much of the spending. Feingold, up for re-election this year, was
the Democratic champion of campaign finance reform legislation that

HE STOOD FOR POLITICS AT ITS BEST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- He was arguably the best mayor Boston never had,
among a handful of people who mattered most to the turbulent city
of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   No one did more for the House of Representatives over the last
generation who was never elected to it; no history of national
affairs in the 1980s is complete without his large thumbprint.
</P>
<P>
   The last four presidents have known all about his special gifts
and felt their impact; the two Democrats (the completely different
Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton) had more than one occasion to depend
on them big time.
</P>
<P>
   On an average day he could get your brother a fair shot at the
police force, help repair Social Security, broker the biggest tax
bill of modern times, keep the Big Dig's cash coming, and still
make it home for supper.
</P>
<P>
   All across the intersections where politics and government meet
in the interests of real people, the shock and pain at Kirk
O'Donnell's death over the Labor Day weekend is the only recent
event to unite Republicans, congressional Democrats, and
Clintonites in this season of shame and ugliness.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think all this emotion concerned a senior statesman
passing on after a long lifetime of service, the occasion for a
proud-sad moment to celebrate a life lived magnificently.
</P>
<P>
   But the shock and pain arrived like a rusty blade in the gut
because O'Donnell was only 52; he did things in his 30s and 40s
that big shots in their 60s never accomplish. But the best was
still ahead of him, and the sky was the limit; if the Democrats
ever elect another president, a Cabinet post or chief of the White
House staff would have been lateral movements for him.
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of death that shakes your faith, making it all
the more important to reaffirm it. And the fact is this blend of
Dorchester and D.C., of Boston Latin and Brown was a walking
reaffirmation of faith in the potential of public service, a
shining example of the silent majority who don't broker votes for
cash, check their principles at the front desk, ignore their
families, welsh on their commitments, indulge their whims and their
urges, lie, and shirk. His life demonstrates that at the end only
two things matter _ whether your word's any good and how you treat
others.
</P>
<P>
   Two stories: Kevin Hagen White gets the credit for discovering
him in the early years of decentralized innovation and leadership
and hope for the racially polarized town. By 1975, the young
political junkie who could explain Boston by precinct or by parish
was entrusted with White's third-term reelection campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It was the roughest, ugliest, closest fight in modern Boston
times. The people involved, despite all they've done since, still
get together to tell the old stories and refight the old shouting
matches. The one reputation that was enhanced by the bruising
experience was O'Donnell's, for focusing like a laser beam on
organizing the White vote and focusing on Joe Timilty's lack of a
clear alternative.
</P>
<P>
   After it was over and he was down in Washington with Tip
O'Neill, it was increasingly clear that his former boss had lost
his fastball. Again and again, from the shadows of the speaker's
rooms in the Capitol, O'Donnell saw to Boston's interests. He would
happily recount to me the stories of program formulas rejiggered to
benefit the cities, of special items in appropriations bills (worth
billions of dollars over time) as long as I understood that if I
used his name in public he would rip my lungs out.
</P>
<P>
   Just for the record, O'Donnell was more than enough of a city
lover and urban scholar to know about subway analogies in politics.
But he was the guy, in 1981, who called Social Security the third
rail of American politics; few lines have been ripped off more. But
he did it to make a point _ that Ronald Reagan had touched it by
reaching beyond his mandate to try to slash future benefits in a
partisan initiative. With the help of the worst recession in 50
years, he and Speaker O'Neill pounced on that goof to effectively
end the Reagan Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   But that same skill was then put to use on the speaker's behalf
to help broker a bipartisan repair job that has lasted 15 years and
made the next stage of generational common sense possible. He was
to Congress in the 1980s what Jim Baker was to the Reagan White
House.
</P>
<P>
   He was a big guy, with a big voice he rarely used except to
laugh. Everyone trusted him. There are tears being shed today in
saloons and salons, in boardrooms and in back rooms. Kirk
O'Donnell's life demonstrates the power of the haunting challenge
made famous by the Kennedys, that all of us can make a difference
and that each of us should try.

IN REELING RUSSIA, STATES ACTING ALONE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MOSCOW _ With Russia reeling from its worst economic crisis in
years, and Moscow deadlocked in a power struggle over a new
government, the country's regional leaders, fearing famine and mass
protest, are trying to solve their problems on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to stem a desperate rush for goods not seen since the
1991 breakup of the Soviet Union, Russia's governors have traded
the invisible hand of the market for the iron fist of centralized
rule.
</P>
<P>
   As the ruble currency rapidly loses its value and prices
skyrocket, regional leaders have slapped price controls on staple
items, issued limits on trade, and halted payments of taxes to the
federal government in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Some regions have declared an economic state of emergency.
Others have talked of Russia's need to devolve into a loose
confederation of independent states. Some observers are predicting
something much worse: a nightmare scenario of 89 impoverished
mini-states sprawled across Russia's nine time zones from the
Pacific Ocean to the Baltic, some with nuclear weapons, each with
its own economy, armed forces, and bones to pick with its
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   While there is no sign yet that any of Russia's regions want to
follow the path taken by Chechnya in 1994 and declare their
independence, politicians and analysts are concerned that weakened
federal authorities are rapidly losing what power they have to
prevent regional leaders from doing whatever they want.
</P>
<P>
   So far, President Boris N. Yeltsin and the State Duma, the lower
house of parliament, have been too wrapped up in their standoff
over who will lead the next government to concern themselves with
what is going on in Russia's regions.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the absence of an agreement among the major political
players in Moscow, the country could dissolve,'' said Nikolai
Petrov, a specialist on regional politics for the Moscow Carnegie
Center. ``The breakup of Russia is a very real possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The influential Moscow newspaper Kommersant Daily went a step
further last week, printing a map of the Russia of the future,
divided up into 10 regional groupings.
</P>
<P>
   Added Russian lawmaker Grigory Yavlinsky: ``Yeltsin runs the
risk of going down in history as the president who oversaw the
dissolution of Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   The governors themselves say they are trying to prevent a
breakdown into anarchy. They say that they are the ones who will
have to answer for a new round of hyperinflation and poverty to
angry citizens who have already suffered through seven years of
hardship during Russia's move away from a centralized economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``By regulating prices, I am on the brink of breaking the law,
but I think these actions are justified,'' said Alexander I. Lebed,
the governor of the huge Krasnoyarsk region in Siberia. ``I am
determined to avert famine in the region. We must stop crowds of
hungry people from turning out in the streets and pillaging
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The rapid fall in the ruble's value has threatened to halt food
imports to Russia, which make up between 60 and 65 percent of food
products sold across the country, and up to 85 percent in Moscow.
Many foreign companies, worried about a banking system on the verge
of collapse, have already canceled deliveries to Russia, Foreign
Trade Minister Andrei Kushneryenko said last week. And Russian
importers, wary of the plunging value of the ruble, are unwilling
to spend their dollars on food items abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Arkady Volsky, head of Russia's industrialist union,
said that food imports are down to 10 percent of their level before
Aug. 17, when the government abandoned its efforts to support the
Russian currency.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the ruble has dropped from just over 6 to the dollar
to as low as 20.90 to the dollar Tuesday. Wednesday, the Russian
currency strengthened to 15.77 to the dollar in a day when rubles
suddenly became scarce and banks appeared to be selling off
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Russian media reported shortages across the country in food,
medicine, and other basic goods.
</P>
<P>
   By exerting control over their regional economies, governors are
expressing their lack of confidence in market-oriented policies
that the Kremlin has haltingly sought to impose on a national
level. But what Yeltsin and his advisers have been calling ``market
reforms'' are viewed by people in outlying regions much the same
way people used to think of the directives of the Soviet Communist
Party Central Committee: a promise of a better future that turned
out to be a big hoax.
</P>
<P>
   A number of governors have followed Lebed's lead on price
controls, even though the practice is bound to make the situation
worse. Much of the food in stores across Russia is imported, which
means its ruble price is related to the cost in hard currency of
bringing it into the country. The most likely effect of price
controls is that stores will go out of business, causing even more
panic. Other regions have restricted ``foreign trade'' with
neighboring Russian regions, a practice intended to stimulate the
growth of regional producers. In fact, the restrictions have made
it harder for food producers to find buyers for their goods.
</P>
<P>
   A more drastic form of civil disobedience has been taken up by
Lebed's brother, Alexei, the governor of the Siberian region of
Khakassia just south of Krasnoyarsk, who ordered his administration
to stop making tax payments to Moscow. In recent weeks, Lebed's
initiative has been copied by the leaders of the vast Siberia
region of Sakha-Yakutia, home to Russia's most lucrative gold and
diamond mines, and Kaliningrad, the base of Russia's Baltic Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, there is little Yeltsin can do to rein in regional
leaders. Governors have long run things the way the like, closing
down newspapers, fixing elections, spending federal money intended
for wages on personal projects. There have been protests, but
little action from the Kremlin, which depends on the governors, and
the Federation Council, the upper house of parliament made up of
regional leaders, for political support in its battles with the
opposition-dominated Duma.
</P>
<P>
   Most federal institutions are weak, while regional leaders have
fashioned their governments into latter-day fiefdoms, part of
Russia but managed independently. An apathetic and disenfranchised
public had little to say about this situation even before the
latest crisis. The federally funded army, police, and security
forces tend to be no less loyal to the local governor, who is far
more accessible than the far-off federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The main lever of influence the federal government has over
regional authorities has been the budget. But with no government in
place, that influence has disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real danger is a return to feudalism and an agricultural
economy, or in other words, a disintegration into regional
states,'' wrote Yulia Latynina, a political analyst for Expert
magazine. ``The problem with this particular outcome is that the
West would have to deal with 88 nuclear powers ... with leaders no
more competent than Saddam Hussein or Moammar Khadafy.''

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel and Steve Murray

<TEXT>

   (Reviewer's initials appear at end of review). Grades range from
A to F.
</P>
<P>
   Air Bud: Golden Receiver G
</P>
<P>
   If you're under 8, this ``Bud's'' for you. In this sequel to
``Air Bud,'' Buddy, the hoop-shooting Golden Retriever, and his
boy, Josh (Kevin Zegers) trade basketball for football. Scriptwise,
it's little more than a glorified after-school special, but there
hasn't been much around for younger kids recently and it handles
its messages well. And so what if the movie is essentially a series
of Stupid Pet Tricks? In his K-9 jersey, pads and helmet, Buddy
looks more athletically heroic than Bruce Willis. 1 hour, 31
minutes. (ER) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Armageddon PG-13
</P>
<P>
   While ``Deep Impact'' treated a similar let's-save-Earth story
with sobriety, ``Armageddon'' never lets the threat of global
annihilation get in the way of fun. It's a space-cowboy movie, with
Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck saving the world for Liv Tyler. As a
summer popcorn movie, it's more enjoyable than that big-lizard
flick ``Godzilla.'' And you'll see the reported $165 million budget
onscreen in the impressive effects and mammoth sets. But is the
movie good for you? Probably not. Rated PG-13 for sci-fi disaster
action, implied sex and profanity. 2 hours, 24 minutes. (SM) Grade:
C
</P>
<P>
   The Avengers PG
</P>
<P>
   Visually, this update of the '60s TV series pays witty homage to
the original's vein of Carnaby Street surrealism. In between sips
of champagne and civilized quips, agents John Steed (Ralph Fiennes)
and Mrs. Emma Peel (Uma Thurman) foil criminals plotting against
the British government. But there are two problems: a half-baked
script and Thurman, who's trumped by the cool, feline memory of
Diana Rigg, who originated the role. (SM) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   BASEketball R
</P>
<P>
   Thank heaven for the rude boys of summer. In the wake of the
Farrelly brothers and ``There's Something About Mary,'' here come
``South Park'' creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone in another
zesty, disgusting, laugh-out-loud comedy. Parker and Stone play two
slackers who invent a hybrid of baseball and basketball that
becomes a national sport. The movie manages to be racist, sexist,
homophobic and just about everything else. But it does so in a way
that kiddingly tweaks the very notion of political correctness.
Rated R for profanity, gross-out humor. 1 hour, 43 minutes. (SM)
Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Blade R
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't cut it. Wesley Snipes stars as the half-vampire,
half-human hero who can handle sunlight but also has a taste for
blood. Armed with an arsenal of sci-fi gadgets, a really cool
leather coat and Kris Kristofferson (a kind of high-tech Gabby
Hayes), Blade is devoted to wiping out all vampires. Especially a
strutting bloodsucker played by Stephen Dorff. Alas, all the
non-stop slash 'n' gnash action becomes more repetitive than
anything else. Rated R for extreme violence and strong language. 2
hours. (ER) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Dance With Me PG
</P>
<P>
   A guilty, quick-stepping pleasure. Vanessa L. Williams plays a
Houston dance instructor who hopes to recapture past dance
competition glory with the help of a Cuban newcomer (Latin music
star Chayanne). Original it isn't, but ``Dance'' is great fun. It's
the first film that lets Williams show off her knockout dancing,
and in his first Hollywood flick, Chayanne goes for the summer's
heartthrob title. 2 hours, 6 minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Dead Man on Campus R
</P>
<P>
   Some passable laughs, but it doesn't make the honor roll. Two
college students (Tom Everett Scott and Mark-Paul Gosselaar) hope a
kamikaze frat boy (Lochlyn Munro), will share their dorm suite.
And, preferably, kill himself in one of his misadventures. That's
because an odd clause at their college gives students an automatic
4.0 average if their roommate offs himself. Rated R for drug use,
language and crude sexual humor. At metro theaters. 1 hour, 36
minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Deep Impact PG-13
</P>
<P>
   The impact here is human, which is pretty gutsy since, going in,
we all know this is about a giant comet hurtling toward Earth.
Director Mimi Leder harks back to 1959's ``On the Beach'' in her
determination to show that worldwide catastrophes can be measured
one human life at a time. Her strong cast is headed by Tea Leoni,
Morgan Freeman, Elijah Wood and Robert Duvall. Rated PG-13 for
violence, language and end-of-the-world jitters. 2 hours, 3
minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Disturbing Behavior R
</P>
<P>
   Disturbingly lame. This teens-in-peril flick is a high-concept
pitch with zero follow-through _ it's ``The Stepford Teens'' with a
touch of ``Invasion of the Body Snatchers.'' James Marsden plays a
newcomer to a smalltown high school who encounters a band of
frighteningly clean-cut students. With the help of the school
psychiatrist (Bruce Greenwood), these fascist Archies ``recruit'' a
new classmate into their group every few days. Rated R for
profanity, violence and sex. 1 hour, 23 minutes. (SM) Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dolittle PG-13
</P>
<P>
   This raucous but uninspired Eddie Murphy vehicle has almost
nothing to do with the old Rex Harrison musical. Murphy is John
Dolittle, a busy doctor who has neglected his wife (Kristen Wilson)
and his two daughters. One day, all kinds of animals start
pestering him vocally. Despite the zing of some nuttier moments,
the lame plot keeps dragging the movie to the ground. Rated PG-13
for crude humor and language. 1 hour, 30 minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Ever After PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Happily, this ``Ever After'' proves you can teach an old doll
new tricks. Re-inventing the Cinderella story in a way that targets
``Titanic''-loving teens more than Barney grads, the movie stars
Drew Barrymore as its spirited heroine, Anjelica Huston as her
scheming stepmother and Dougray Scott as a Prince who's more than
just another trophy husband. Jeanne Moreau, doyenne of the French
New Wave, contributes a classy cameo. Rated PG-13 for emotional
situations (death of a father) and some violence. 2 hours. (ER)
Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Everest NR
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' This
44-minute documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm
that killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' Cameraman David Breashears
fills the screen with awesome vistas, but discreetly avoids the
piles of discarded oxygen tanks, human waste and frozen bodies that
now litter the trails of the mountain. This is a film whose cruel
beauty manages to celebrate the spirit of the climbers, while
making you question their sanity. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   54 R
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan nightclub Studio 54 was a late-'70s blast of
neo-Roman decadence where everyone could be fabulous.
Unfortunately, writer-director Mark Christopher gives us a tired,
creaky fable about a smalltown stud (Ryan Phillippe) who gets
seduced by the limelight, almost loses himself, but gets saved by
the right girl. The movie is as meek as Studio 54 was outrageous.
Rated R for sexuality, profanity, drug use. 1 hour, 33 minutes.
(SM) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Godzilla PG-13
</P>
<P>
   He's back. He's big. He's boring. There was probably no way
Hollywood's extravagant update of ``Godzilla'' could live up to its
year-long hype. What's depressing is how far it falls short from
being even solid summer escapism. Bikini Atoll resident Godzilla
comes to nest in Manhattan when it's time to think of family
matters. Matthew Broderick is a biologist on the monster's trail.
Rated PG-13 for sci-fi action/violence. 2 hours, 19 minutes. (SM)
Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Halloween: H20 R
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Lee Curtis returns in this unsurprising 20th anniversary
sequel to John Carpenter's 1978 frightfest ``Halloween.'' Now,
she's a single mom to 17-year-old John (Josh Hartnett). Also back
is Michael Myers, the maniac who stalked Curtis all those years
ago. You can easily guess who'll survive and who'll get cut out of
the picture, literally. But when Curtis pulls a Sigourney Weaver, a
la ``Aliens,'' stalking Michael instead of fleeing him, the movie
finally gets some juice. Rated R for profanity, violence, gore,
alcohol use. 1 hour, 22 minutes. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   How Stella Got Her Groove Back R
</P>
<P>
   The screen version of Terry McMillan's novel tries to distract
us from its lack of plot with visual opulence. Angela Bassett plays
a fortysomething investment banker who takes a trip to Jamaica with
her best pal (Whoopi Goldberg), where she falls for a 20-year-old
local (Taye Diggs). Luckily, Bassett roots the picture with a
glowing performance, sharing with us Stella's unexpected moments of
emotional rediscovery. Rated R for sexual situations, nudity,
language. 2 hours, 4 minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Knock Off R
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Claude Van Damme returns in _ surprise! _ an action movie
about an American salesman working in Hong Kong who becomes aware
of a terrorist conspiracy. Directed by Hong Kong action auteur Tsui
Hark. Not reviewed. Grade: NR
</P>
<P>
   Lethal Weapon 4 R
</P>
<P>
   The latest in director Richard Donner's cheerfully chaotic
blow-'em-up series re-pairs Mel Gibson's hothead cop Riggs, and
Danny Glover's long-suffering partner Murtaugh. Shaggy and amiable,
Number 4 hardly bothers to get its real plot going for its first
hour. More than ever, the film is an excuse to give its crack
supporting cast, including Joe Pesci and Chris Rock, a series of
comic riffs. Rated R for violence and profanity. 2 hours, 5
minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Madeline PG
</P>
<P>
   A remarkably faithful and fun adaptation of the beloved series
of children's books about a precocious redheaded orphan living in a
girls school. Set in the relatively uncomplicated 1950s and
breathtakingly filmed in Paris, it's fast-paced enough to appeal to
kids (even little boys should take to the motor scooter-riding
rascal Pepito) and just nostalgic enough for adults. Rated PG for
comic violence. 1 hour, 29 minutes. (Jill Vejnoska) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Mafia! PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere Francis Ford Coppola is sobbing. But his masterpiece,
``The Godfather,'' isn't the only movie to take a hit in this
ridiculous spoof by writer/director Jim Abrahams, part of the trio
who brought us ``Airplane!'' and the ``Naked Gun'' series. There
are also jabs at ``Casino'' and ``Il Postino.'' Lloyd Bridges plays
the head of a crime family; Jay Mohr (``Jerry Maguire'') is his
ruthless son. Rated PG-13 for profanity, violence and drug content.
1 hour, 33 minutes. (Knight Ridder Newspapers) Grade: NR
</P>
<P>
   The Mask of Zorro PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Derring-do done right. Our men in black are Anthony Hopkins and
Antonio Banderas who double our swashbuckling pleasure and double
our fun as dual Zorros, saving California and Hopkins' beautful,
spirited daughter (stunning newcomer, Catherine Zeta-Jones) from
the evil schemes of one Don Rafael (Stuart Wilson). It's an expert
blend of panache, romanticism and supple, tongue-in-cheek humor.
Rated PG-13 for violence. 2 hours, 16 minutes. (ER) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Mulan G
</P>
<P>
   The best Disney animated feature since ``Beauty and the Beast''
and ``The Lion King.'' Based on a 4th-century legend, it's about a
young girl who pulls a National Velvet, i.e., disguises herself as
a boy and goes to battle in her elderly father's place. This isn't
just a grand family film; it's a grand film, period. As Eddie
Murphy's little red dragon says, ``Mulan, you the man!'' 1 hour, 28
minutes. (ER) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   The Negotiator R
</P>
<P>
   In this crisply acted thriller, Samuel L. Jackson plays a
hostage negotiator for the Chicago police department who is framed
for embezzlement and murder. Desperate to clear his name, he takes
four members of the department hostage, then asks another
negotiator (Kevin Spacey) to act as a mediator between himself and
his fellow officers. The film's main kick is the engrossing duel of
bluffs and counterbluffs between Spacey and Jackson. They make us
believe in the high stakes of the situation. Rated R for violence
and profanity. 2 hours, 15 minutes. (SM) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Next Stop, Wonderland R
</P>
<P>
   A small wonder in its own modest way. This charming low-budget
romantic comedy about the relationship travails of a Boston nurse
(Hope Davis) is stronger on character nuance than on plot; in fact,
filmmaker Brad Anderson loads it with too much plot. But by
applying a naturalistic independent-film sensibility to a vintage
glossy-Hollywood predicament, he comes out ahead. Think of a film
where John Cassavetes shares pillow talk with Doris Day. Rated R
for vulgar language and sexual situations. 1 hour, 36 minutes. (ER)
Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   The Opposite of Sex R
</P>
<P>
   Christina Ricci's teen tart burns across the screen in this
acerbic yet strangely sweet black comedy. The convoluted plot kicks
off when Ricci visits her gay half-brother (Martin Donovan) and
steals his dim-bulb lover (Ivan Sergei). The eclectic (and fine)
supporting cast includes Lisa Kudrow and Lyle Lovett. Rated R for
vulgar language, sexual situations, some nudity and sexual
references. 1 hour, 40 minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Out of Sight R
</P>
<P>
   Another winning adaptation of a book by Elmore Leonard, the
brain that cooked up ``Get Shorty.'' George Clooney plays a courtly
bank robber, Jennifer Lopez is the federal marshal he kidnaps. In
outline, this is a screwball romantic comedy. It just happens to be
propelled by firepower, betrayal, bloodshed _ and the erotic
gravitational pull between the two leads. Rated R for language. 2
hours, 9 minutes. (SM) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   The Parent Trap PG
</P>
<P>
   Wisely deviates little from the plot of the 1961 Disney film
that made 15-year-old Hayley Mills a star. This time Lindsay Lohan
plays the dual role of separated-practically-at-birth identical
twins who meet and switch identities in the hopes of reuniting
their divorced parents. Fax machines and ``Leo'' DiCaprio
references dot this modernized tale. Young kids may fidget at the
length and several kissing scenes. Rated PG for mild profanity and
alcohol use. 2 hours, 7 minutes. (Jill Vejnoska) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   A Perfect Murder R
</P>
<P>
   Not perfect, this ``Dial M for Murder'' remake is still a guilty
pleasure, a slick B-movie jazzed up with great clothes, art
direction and decent plot twists. Michael Douglas plays a business
shark whose boom is going bust, so he attempts to hire his wealthy
wife's lover to kill her. Rated R for language, sex and violence. 1
hour, 47 minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Return to Paradise R
</P>
<P>
   Hardly paradise. Three guys party hard together in Malaysia. Two
(Vince Vaughn, David Conrad) return home and find out, two years
later from a lawyer (Anne Heche), that the third (Joaquin Phoenix)
has been jailed on drug charges since they left and will be hanged
in eight days unless they return to share the responsibility. But
that also means sharing the jail time. It's a terriifc,
what-would-you-do moral dilemma that's squandered by an inept
script. Rated R for language, drug references and a brief sex
scene. 1 hour, 49 minutes. (ER) Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Rounders R
</P>
<P>
   Director John Dahl (``The Last Seduction'') has a couple of very
hot aces up his sleeve _ Matt Damon and Edward Norton _ in this
nifty movie about the addictive lure of high-stakes poker. Damon is
a former card sharp who's managed to kick the habit and concentrate
on his law studies. Norton is his old friend, fresh out of jail,
who lures him back. A pungent, character-rich picture that's a lot
less about where it goes than how it gets there. Rated R for nudity
and language. 2 hours. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Saving Private Ryan R
</P>
<P>
   Part gung-ho heroism, part in-your-face horror show, Steven
Spielberg's superb film shows us World War II as we've never seen
it before. Tom Hanks leads a courageous squad (and excellent
ensemble cast) on a mission to find a private (Matt Damon) whose
three brothers have already been killed in combat. Hanks'
performance is a miracle of decency and subtle emotion, but kudos
all 'round here. And the opening D-Day sequence is the most
powerful combat footage ever created on film. Rated R for extreme
violence and some vulgar language. 2 hours, 50 minutes. (ER) Grade:
A
</P>
<P>
   Simon Birch PG
</P>
<P>
   A little movie with big problems. In the early 1960s, a
pre-adolescent dwarf named Simon Birch (Ian Michael Smith) is
convinced he will one day be a hero while his best pal (Joseph
Mazzello) tries to solve the mystery of his real father (Ashley
Judd is Mazzello's closemouthed mom.) The movie is clearly a labor
of love; alas, it's also a labor to sit through. Rated PG for
violence (a scary bus accident) and sexual innuendo. 1 hour, 50
minutes. (ER) Grade: D-
</P>
<P>
   Six Days, Seven Nights PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Think ``Romancing the Stone'' ... only without the romance or
the adventure. Harrison Ford is a gruff charter pilot and Anne
Heche is a New York magazine editor. They wind up stranded on an
island near Tahiti _ an abandoned place, except for some pirates.
The pair bicker, bond and kick some pirate butt. Rated PG-13 for
sexual entendres and implied sex. 1 hour, 41 minutes. (SM) Grade:
C+
</P>
<P>
   Slums of Beverly Hills R
</P>
<P>
   A vivid, very funny look at coming of age on the fringes. Vivian
Abramowitz (Natasha Lyonne) is the odd girl out in a post-divorce
family led by a father (Alan Arkin) who, every three months or so,
skips out on rent and moves his brood to another fleabag on the
edge of Beverly Hills. Director Tamara Jenkins re-creates the daily
humiliations of adolescence with wince-inducing accuracy. And
Lyonne is terrific at navigating the waters of teen angst. Rated R
for nudity, profanity, sexual situations. 1 hour, 31 minutes. (SM)
Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Smoke Signals PG-13
</P>
<P>
   A bittersweet coming-of-age comedy about two Native Americans
who leave their dilapidated reservation to go to Arizona to fetch
their father's (one biological; the other spiritual) body. Rambling
and rough around the edges, with a honed casualness that suggests
the early '70s, Chris Eyre's debut film is still definitely worth a
look. Rated PG-13 for vulgar language and alcohol abuse. 1 hour, 30
minutes. (ER) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Snake Eyes R
</P>
<P>
   Oscar-winner Nicolas Cage and Brian De Palma are always worth
gambling on; while they don't come up total winners here, they're
hardly losers either. Cage plays a crooked Atlantic City cop who
finds himself in the middle of an assassination plot during a
heavyweight boxing match. Part detective story, part
action-thriller, the picture loses steam near the end, but De
Palma's wired camerawork and Cage's strutting energy help hold it
together. Rated R for violence and language. 1 hour, 42 minutes.
(ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   There's Something About Mary R
</P>
<P>
   Rude, crude and hilarious, this comedy by the ``Dumb &AMP; Dumber''
team of Peter and Bobby Farrelly definitely isn't a family film.
Ben Stiller plays Ted, a nerdy high school senior who suffers a
very particular bathroom mishap that keeps him from attending his
prom with the class golden girl (Cameron Diaz). Thirteen years
later, he hires a lower-rung gumshoe (Matt Dillon) to track her
down. The movie is liberating in its scatological, slapstick way.
But the easy-to-offend should find something more polite to watch.

   This Russian fable of fathers and sons will steal into your
heart. In 1952, as Stalin inflicts his style of `'paternalism'' on
the Soviet Union, a six-year -old boy and his young widowed mom are
wooed by a charming soldier (Vladmir Mashkov) who isn't what he
seems. As allegories go, this one's pretty transparent. But the
film's considerable strength lies in its poetic vignettes, telling
visual details and three wonderful performances. A 1998 Oscar

language. Subtitles. 1 hour, 30 minutes. (ER) Grade: A-

ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS SUE TO PROD FOREST SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Twenty-one environmental organizations have
filed a federal lawsuit to block logging in the national forests.
The action is aimed at prodding the U.S. Forest Service into
finalizing a plan for managing the resources it controls.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint, filed Wednesday, asks the U.S. District Court in
Oakland to bar the Forest Service from awarding timber-sale
contracts until it has adopted a Resources Planning Act program,
supported by an environmental impact statement.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Act, the Forest Service was to have adopted such a
program in 1995, but objections from the timber industry persuaded
Congress to put the brakes on it.
</P>
<P>
   A 1995 draft plan concluded that recreation activities in the
national forests contributed more to the economy than did logging
and were ecologically much more benign.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Congress passed legislation prohibiting the Forest
Service from finalizing the plan until Sept. 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been directed through the appropriation bills for the
last couple of years not to finalize the RPA (Resources Planning
Act) program, and what that means is that we are not to use any
funds in the bill on it,'' said Alan Polk, spokesman for the Forest
Service in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The RPA program sets national goals for timber harvesting,
cattle grazing, recreation and other resource-related items. In the
absence of such a program, the complaint alleges, ``the Forest
Service cannot insure that trends and effects associated with
national programs such as timber harvesting are being properly
considered and that irreparable injury to national resources ... is
not occurring.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Galvin of the Southwest Center for Biological Diversity in
Tucson, Ariz., the lead plaintiff, said the Forest Service's hands
will be untied at the end of this month, but ``they have not
allocated any money for RPA. If they took the money they used to
pay for timber sales and allocated it to RPA, that would solve the
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Polk noted that the Forest Service is due to receive a report on
proposed changes to the RPA later this fall from a committee of
scientists who have been working the matter since January.

 &HT;    
 By LARISSA MacFARQUHAR  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 NOTE: Full-length article (3,100 words) available on request  
 &HT;    Joyce Maynard wrote her first memoir, ``Looking Back,'' when she
was 19; now, at 44, she has written her second, ``At Home in the
World.''
 &HT;    In the 25 intervening years, Maynard bought a house, nearly had
a nervous breakdown, lost her virginity to the soundtrack of
``Pippin,'' met Mary Tyler Moore and Muhammad Ali, was raped, got
married, appeared on TV, had three children, emptied her breast
milk into the Atlantic, planted a garden, went broke, had an
abortion, clawed through a heap of garbage looking for a lost
retainer, wrote three novels, watched her parents get divorced and
die, got divorced herself, bought another house, got breast
implants and took them out again, took tennis lessons, sold most of
her possessions and moved from New Hampshire to California.
 &HT;    Over the years, Maynard has related many of these events in her
syndicated newspaper column (now defunct) and in articles for
women's magazines. Oddly, she has been chastised severely, and
often for imagining that any of them could possibly be interesting.
 &HT;    The one thing Maynard has done that everyone agrees is
interesting is have a nine-month affair with J.D. Salinger. The
story, as Maynard tells it in her new book, goes like this.
 &HT;    Twenty-six years ago, when she was a freshman at Yale, Maynard
published an essay in The New York Times Magazine, ``An 18-Year-Old
Looks Back on Life,'' that made her famous. Among the hundreds of
letters she received in response to the article, and to the winsome
photograph of her that appeared on the cover, was one from
Salinger, then 53.
 &HT;    Maynard corresponded with him for several weeks, met him, fell
in love with him and quit school to move into his house in New
Hampshire. He told her that she was very talented, and that he
loved her. They talked about having children. They lived together
through the winter of 1972 and into the following spring.
 &HT;    But she began to irritate him: She was sloppy, she read TV Guide
and little else, she wrote what she thought people would like to
read because she wanted fame and glamour. She was too clenched up
to have intercourse _ she got terrible headaches when they tried.
Finally, disappointed, Salinger sent her away.
 &HT;    For years, Maynard refused to discuss this affair. In doing so
now, she is violating the privacy of a figure who is revered in a
very personal way by a great many people, both for his writing and
for his decision to retreat into the silence that Maynard is
breaking. She will be _ indeed she already has been _ called
shameless and mercenary. Maynard knows this, of course.
 &HT;    In the months preceding the book's publication, Maynard was to
be found at home in Marin County, just north of San Francisco,
editing her manuscript and driving her 14-year-old, Willy, to his
tennis tournaments. She has spent much of her life engaged in
mother activity of this sort _ perhaps she'd be a better writer if
she hadn't.
 &HT;    We met at a match one afternoon and lay on the grass in the
shade with Maynard's unsightly dog and her exquisite son. Maynard
laughed frequently _ a loud laugh with a hysterical edge to it,
involving knee-slapping.
 &HT;    Writing this book had been, for her, the exorcism of a past that
has been festering for years. ``When I first embarked on it, it
felt like such a forbidden thing, like my grandfather eating
pork,'' she said. ``But now I've come to feel there's nothing so
terrible about the truth, and it's such a relief.''
 &HT;    Maynard could now joke about her notoriety. She told me about a
guy she met at a party in San Francisco. ``He came over to me and
said: 'Joyce Maynard! You're the one who lived with. ...''' Maynard
snapped her fingers, imitating the man trying to remember the name.
```Thomas Pynchon?' I said, and he says: `Yeah! That's the one!'''
 &HT;    In a sense Maynard, despite her age, is still unsettlingly
childlike. She is tiny and cute; her dark brown eyes are so big
they are just short of buggy. She wears red-hooded sweatshirts and
little sheepskin booties. But there is also something almost
tangibly maternal about her, as though her skin retained
impressions from her children's bodies.
 &HT;    The thing people say about Maynard is that she takes up a lot of
space. She is not one for keeping quiet about things. She is
dramatic and demands attention. She experiences wild ups and
precipitous downs. She is always getting into car accidents. Once,
in a pizza restaurant with her family, she dumped a glass of beer
over her head by way of communicating her frustration with the
evening.
 &HT;    The pairing of Maynard and Salinger _ the writer whose metier is
autobiography and the writer who's so private he won't even publish
_ was an unlikely one, and the story of their affair makes for
uncomfortable reading.
 &HT;    The Salinger that emerges from Maynard's side of the story is a
rather attenuated figure. We don't see him writing or talking about
writing _ he didn't let her into that part of his life. We see him
only in his relationship with Maynard: the waxing and waning of his
love for her and the eccentric domestic rituals with which the
waning was entwined (his peculiar diet, his meditation, his
practice of homeopathy).
 &HT;    At the time she was living with Salinger, Maynard was at the
height of her fame. She had become the unofficial spokesperson for
the Youth of America, and people were continually calling her up,
asking her to appear on the radio, to write articles, to have her
photograph taken. Under Salinger's influence, she turned many
offers down. Still, Salinger could tell she was tempted, and was
disgusted by her worldliness.
 &HT;    Of course, Salinger's own obsessive privacy was also a form of
caring about the world's opinion, a poisonous sensitivity. In one
of Maynard's few references in her memoir to Salinger's writing,
she observes that his voice in person is Holden Caulfield's voice,
only not so kind.
 &HT;    In her account, the contempt for everything and everyone
``phony'' that in the teen-age Holden betokened a kind of hopeful
idealism seems in the older Salinger rigid to the point of cruelty.
 &HT;    Such an attitude couldn't be more different from that of Maynard
to the outside world. Her relationship with her readers, for
example, is extremely close. One flew her family around in his
private plane. Another recently asked her to officiate at her
marriage. Several have lent her their homes to write in. When she
left New Hampshire for California two years ago, Maynard invited
her readers to a tag sale, and some traveled from distant parts of
the country to attend.
 &HT;    Many keep in almost daily contact with her through her Web site
(www.joycemaynard.com), on which Maynard posts bulletins about her
life and exchanges messages with readers. Occasionally, she posts a
note to explain why she cannot have coffee with absolutely everyone
who wants to meet her.
 &HT;    ``A man wrote me from prison,'' she says, ``to say my stories
about my kids and my family were the one lifeline he had to the
outside world. I wrote back with a picture of my children. He wrote
back to say he'd come to visit us _ maybe fix the wiring in my
house and paint it, maybe marry me _ as soon as he got out on
parole. For the brutal murder of his parents, I learned.''
 &HT;    Still, those who check in regularly can learn, at a virtual
remove, what Maynard's children are doing, what she's been cooking
lately and where she's going on vacation.
 &HT;    One longtime Joyce watcher, a TV producer in New York, explained
to me by e-mail: ``She's the literary equivalent of `The Truman
Show' or Princess Diana _ we've watched Joyce grow up with us. It's
my favorite soap opera: `Joyce's Life.'''
 &HT;    Maynard looks to her readers, and has come to depend upon them,
for love and reassurance. This is, of course, precisely the
relationship to her public that Salinger warned Maynard to avoid,
because praise can tempt a writer to repeat himself. For Maynard,
however, writing per se has never been the point.
 &HT;    Maynard doesn't see herself as a ``literary'' author. She calls
herself a ``journeyman writer'' and an ``entrepreneur.'' She has
produced three novels, the most successful of which _ ``To Die
For'' _ was made into a movie, but most of her time has been spent
turning out articles for money.
 &HT;    She wrote about getting breast implants for Self and then, four
years later, about having them taken out again. When she had an
abortion, she paid for it by writing about it for Redbook. She is
not embarrassed by this.
 &HT;    ``I've assessed sports bras,'' she shrugs. ``I've written about
what the best ride is at Disney World. Last year, Willy wanted to
go to tennis camp, so I got a job _ this was really a new level _
as the spokesperson for Diaper Genie. There was a time when my
husband, Steve, and I were $10,000 in debt from uninsured medical
expenses _ my daughter had broken her arm, we had two babies in
diapers and I just didn't know what I was going to do _ and that
was the moment I thought, I have a trade, a trade that I can ply as
much as if I were a carpenter.
 &HT;    ``It troubles me that people speak about writing for money as
ugly and distasteful. During that first flurry of criticism of this
book, all kinds of people said, `Oh, she's doing it for the money.'
And I thought, Well of course I get paid! Imagine someone
suggesting that a doctor shouldn't get paid!'' (Maynard received a
low-six-figure advance for the book from Picador USA.)
 &HT;    ``But I have to say,'' she continues, ``there was no amount of
money that could have persuaded me to write this story at any other
stage of my life. I've had some very desperate money times over the
years, but it was just never an option. And it wouldn't be
something I'd get into now if I didn't feel that it was the right
thing to do.''
 &HT;    In 1986, Maynard published a collection of her syndicated
newspaper columns in a book, cutely titled ``Domestic Affairs:
Enduring the Pleasures of Motherhood and Family Life.''
 &HT;    On the cover is a photograph of Maynard and her three children
standing in front of their old home in New Hampshire. Maynard's
eyes are red, and her mouth is drawn together in a tight
half-smile. She looks awful. The cartoonish sweetness of her face
is somehow exaggerated and made grotesque by her miserable,
hopeless expression.
 &HT;    She has just been crying, because her husband refused to be in
the picture. The children look restless, glancing off in different
directions. The camera is down near Maynard's knees as though it is
another child at whom Maynard is gazing in mute apology.
 &HT;    This cover was appropriate. In her column, Maynard tended to
portray her life as a homey sitcom, each installment representing a
lovable mistake made and a lesson humbly learned. But all the
while, her marriage to Steve Bethel, an artist, was disintegrating.
 &HT;    ``A good home must be made, not bought,'' she wrote in one
typically precious column. ``In the end, it's not track lighting or
a sun room that brings light into a kitchen.''
 &HT;    It's easy to make fun of essays such as this. And yet there is
something movingly quixotic about Maynard's failed attempt to make
her painful, messy, unflattering life, through her columns, into
happy television. She wasn't wrong, either, about what was required
of her: After her separation announcement, 20-odd newspapers
discontinued her column on the grounds that, as far as family
matters were concerned, she was no longer fit to comment.
 &HT;    Her new book is a departure from her habitual
college-application-essay style. She set out to write it very
plainly, and she certainly did. There's barely an adjective in the
entire thing. There's none of the murky texture of memory; her
story is presented as immediate, undigested experience in the
present tense.
 &HT;    ``I didn't want to tell a reader what to think of any of this,''
Maynard explains. ``I wanted people to live through it.''
 &HT;    Oddly enough, this works. She has, as she intended, let herself
rip, and while Maynard diluted can be cloying, Maynard at full
strength _ in her very shamelessness; in the unrelenting
thoroughness of her self-exposure; in her determination not only to
tell the truth but to tear it open and eviscerate it and squeeze it
until it is bled dry _ is surprisingly powerful.
 -0- 
 &HT;    A few years ago in New York, the writer Francine du Plessix Gray
gave a talk about her forthcoming biography of Louise Colet _ a
poet and a lover of Flaubert's. Flaubert did not come off well in
Gray's account, and among the caddish acts of which she held him
guilty was his hurtful caricaturing of Colet in the character of
Emma Bovary.
 &HT;    Upon hearing this theory, the Daily News columnist Stanley
Crouch stood up in the back of the room.
 &HT;    Writers write about people they know, he protested, and they do
so in ways that are humiliating, nasty, inaccurate and unfair.
That's what writers do.
 &HT;    Is the case of Maynard and Salinger any different? Yes _ but not
because of Salinger's love of privacy. Many people value their
privacy, and there's no reason to privilege Salinger's simply
because, since he is famous, he is obliged to resort to baroque
means to protect it. Nor is this case different because Maynard is
writing autobiography rather than fiction: A fictional portrait can
be every bit as transparent and damaging as a nonfictional one.
 &HT;    No, the reason this case seems different from Flaubert's is
simply that here, Salinger is the better writer.
 &HT;    Imagine the positions reversed. Maynard is the recluse, Salinger
the memoirist. Offered a memoir by one of America's great writers,
who would shed a tear for the violated privacy of Joyce Maynard,
purveyor of minor novels and contributor to women's magazines?

 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 FROM: The Boston Globe Magazine  
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It's a bright Saturday morning in Boston. Just off the Public
Garden, in the health club of the Four Seasons Hotel, two men climb
onto exercise bikes and fiddle with the little TV sets at the
consoles.
 &HT;    Barry MacLean, who runs a large family business in Illinois and
has had his share of frustrations with Washington bureaucracy,
tunes in to cartoons. At the next bike, William Neukom, Microsoft's
chief lawyer in its landmark legal battle with the Justice
Department, tunes in to a C-Span rebroadcast of a presidential
speech.
 &HT;    A moment later, Neukom looks at MacLean's console, then at his
own and mutters, ``What's the difference? It's all entertainment.''
 &HT;    A month later, in the swish setting of the Primi Piatti
restaurant, a few blocks from the White House on Washington's
Pennsylvania Avenue, Warren Beatty is poking at his pasta and
bantering with a handful of capital columnists and TV
correspondents.
 &HT;    There, amid talk of President Clinton's woes and Beatty's movie
``Bulworth,'' the actor has an epiphany: ``There is no difference
anymore between Hollywood and Washington. They are both totally
into the sound bite. One is no more superficial than the other.
Even this whole process of yakking to people about this movie is
really no different from what you'd be doing if you were running
for office.''
 &HT;    Politics. Entertainment. Politics as entertainment. The
distinction between the two, never sharp, is today less well
defined than ever. Once, the presidency was a documentary shown in
prime time; now it has degenerated into a soap opera for afternoon
television.
 &HT;    Once, campaign advertising complemented stump speeches and
position papers; in some races today, the ads virtually replace
stump speeches and position papers. Once, news shows provided a
sober intermission between situation comedies and full-length
feature films; now they have taken on characteristics of both.
 &HT;    ``We are now reaching a point,'' says Sen. Richard Durbin,
Democrat of Illinois, ``where the line between entertainment and
news is blurring.''
 &HT;    In technology as in entertainment, the word for this phenomenon
is ``convergence.'' And what politics and entertainment
increasingly have in common is not only that they reward style more
than content; not only that they seek to manipulate rather than
simply to persuade; not only that they pander rather than
challenge; not only that they reward celebrity and avoid searching
questions.
 &HT;    All those things are true, but the most important similarity
between modern entertainment and modern politics is what is, in a
sense, most un-American about them both: They are passive
experiences.
 &HT;    Like entertainment, politics is increasingly part of the
easy-listening background music of the time _ always present, not
particularly adventuresome, seldom very important. Like
entertainment, politics is increasingly a show of special effects.
Like entertainment, politics is increasingly modified by the word
``virtual.'' And, like entertainment, politics has become something
that other people do.
 &HT;    This movement of politics from the active mode to the passive
has grave implications for American civic life and for the health
of our democratic system. It is, moreover, an important departure
for a nation that was born in the activism of the 18th-century
revolutionaries, that conducted the signature debates of the modern
age in public, that at every turn decided to expand its visions of
freedom and liberty rather than to constrict them _ and that
throughout its history broadened, rather than diminished, its
definition of ``rights.''
 &HT;    ``We are in danger of becoming a nation of spectators,'' warned
The National Commission on Civic Renewal, based in College Park,
Md., which for a year studied American civic life.
 &HT;    There's always been a bit of entertainment in politics and a bit
of politics in entertainment. Indeed, in Elizabethan times the
theater was a public sphere, the place where, in the absence of
newspapers, television, talk radio or Oprah, the real issues were
debated _ with vivid, meaningful conflict over questions such as
monarchical succession, religious freedom, social and class
structure and economic mobility.
 &HT;    ``Entertainment was the very place where political ideas were
articulated and challenged and changed,'' says David Scott Kastan,
a Columbia University authority on Shakespeare and his time. ``It
was what made the theater exciting and entertaining and important,
and it is why we remember Shakespeare today. Now we have an
entertainment industry that doesn't engage in serious political
thought, but worse, we have a political system that doesn't engage
in serious political thought.''
 &HT;    In America too, politics has always had a big entertainment
element but in truth, it was far more entertaining in the past.
Politics was the great national sport at the turn of the century,
and one of the forgotten truths about 19th-century politics is that
many Americans voted for one party or another not because they
favored its politics but because they preferred its barbecues.
 &HT;    Even in more recent days, there was a greater flair and more
flavor to politics. John Lindsay slept overnight on a steelworker's
couch. Barry Goldwater flew his own campaign plane. Nelson
Rockefeller was a walking vaudeville act, traveling in helicopters
and seaplanes and boats, eating Oreo cookies all day long and
shepherding favored reporters to one of the best wine cellars in
the world.
 &HT;    Gov. John Rhodes of Ohio based an entire campaign on visiting
county fairs. One Pennsylvania congressman slept in his office,
surrounded by hundreds of bags of mail that were never opened. Gov.
William Scranton of Pennsylvania used to have roast swan for
Christmas dinner. Jimmy Tayoun, the last of the Philadelphia street
politicians, made a point of running red lights to attend a wake
for a Polish saloonkeeper in South Philadelphia.
 &HT;    ``We've always had great showmen in American politics,'' says
former Sen. George S. McGovern of South Dakota, the Democratic
presidential nominee in 1972. ``But the increased use of media
consultants and all these photo-op tactics lend themselves to false
drama and the creation of entertainment. That's the big
difference.''
 &HT;    American politics used to be a participatory sport, not a
spectator sport, and it was conducted by getting people to hold
signs and sit in phone banks. That is dying or, in some regions, is
dead already. Politicians have a keen sense of trends in American
life, and so they are telling us something when they no longer
devote countless hours to choosing their chief organizers. Now they
spend that time selecting their press secretaries, media
consultants and strategists.
 &HT;    ``Politics today is all media,'' says Michael Whouley, a
Boston-based political consultant who is close to Vice President Al
Gore. ``More than 10 years ago, you would compartmentalize a
campaign: media, fund-raising and field organizing. Now it's
fund-raising, and the fund-raising is all geared to the media.''
 &HT;    This hasn't changed only the way politics is conducted. It also
has changed the sort of people who run for office and, just as
important, the kind of people who are drawn to campaigns. The
organizers are passe. The media manipulators are king.
 &HT;    Listen to the view of Beatty, who grew up in the Washington
suburbs but whose work is done in Hollywood: ``It's impossible to
engage people in a complex issue. You've got to stop them from
channel surfing. You've got to give them a simple, vulgarized
version of things. And you're doing it all with a rearview mirror
that you didn't always have: You now know how people will react to
things.''
 &HT;    Maybe the best place to see the merging of entertainment and
politics is in the movies. Just recently, Michael Douglas, Jack
Nicholson, Gene Hackman, Kevin Kline, Jack Lemmon, James Garner,
Dan Aykroyd, Harrison Ford, Sam Waterston and John Travolta have
all played the president of the United States on film. The American
president isn't only a political figure. It's a movie.
 &HT;    ``Politics has always been show business,'' says former
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who was a principal figure
in the presidential campaigns of Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan and
George Bush. ``Today it's more show business.''
 &HT;    Show business _ complete with celebrities. The entire notion of
celebrity can, of course, be traced to the entertainment world, and
in truth celebrities have always been interested in politics _ and
vice versa.
 &HT;    Frank Mankiewicz, the veteran Washington public-relations
executive and a close adviser to both McGovern and Robert F.
Kennedy, likes to tell about how his uncle, Joe Mankiewicz, a great
director and writer who won four Oscars, called him and said he was
coming to Washington.
 &HT;    Mankiewicz offered to throw a dinner party for his uncle, who
requested that some of the senators in the middle of the Vietnam
debate _ McGovern, Frank Church of Idaho, Gaylord Nelson of
Wisconsin _ be invited. His uncle wanted to spend the evening
talking about reductions in troop strength and what the Chinese
were going to do about Vietnam; the senators wanted only to ask
about the casting couch and Marilyn Monroe.
 &HT;    This hasn't changed. ``Today, you get Barbra Streisand in
Washington, and she wants to talk about land mines,'' Mankiewicz
says, ``and everybody at dinner wants to talk about why she didn't
get nominated for `The Mirror Has Two Faces.'''
 &HT;    In the old days, there were two Hollywoods, one Republican and
one Democratic. The actors and actresses were almost all
Republicans, the writers and producers almost all Democrats. There
were no centrists. The conservatives were very far to the right,
and the liberals were very much to the left. The Hitler-Stalin pact
of 1939 split the left, but even then there was no middle ground.
And so the debates were furious. Hollywood was divided over FDR and
the New Deal and over Upton Sinclair's 1934 gubernatorial campaign
in California.
 &HT;    There's nothing new about someone such as Beatty being involved
in the presidential campaigns of RFK in 1968, McGovern in 1972 and
Gary Hart in 1984. But what is new is the melding of politics and
celebrity, and that began with John Kennedy.
 &HT;    ``Reagan may be the first movie-star president, but after all,
the Kennedys themselves made glamour an indispensable part of
American politics long before the host of `Death Valley Days' and
the `General Electric Theater' reached the White House,'' Michael
Knox Beran writes in ``The Last Patrician,'' the remarkable book
about Robert Kennedy published this spring. ``Joseph Kennedy was in
Hollywood, learning its lessons, studying its methods, financing
its movies, 10 years before Ronald Reagan showed up at Jack
Warner's studio in Burbank in 1937.''
 &HT;    But though Joe Kennedy had been drawn to Hollywood and its
melange of starlets and celebrity, his son John had a celebrity of
his own, a breezy insouciance, a touch of intellectualism, a quick
sense of humor.
 &HT;    ``We didn't have to make Kennedy a celebrity, and nobody in the
campaign _ Larry O'Brien and Kenny O'Donnell and Ted Sorensen _ was
a celebrity,'' says Joe Napolitan, who worked for Kennedy in 1960,
Johnson in 1964 and Hubert H. Humphrey in 1968 and may have been
the first person ever to call himself a political consultant. ``He
naturally had it all: He was a war hero, he was handsme, he had
just married a glamorous woman, he had a big name and he was a
senator.''
 &HT;    Today a lot of presidential candidates not only try to package
themselves (as 19th-century presidents did, invariably finding a
log cabin in their past) but also try to make themselves
celebrities in their own right.
 &HT;    Surely Bill Clinton has a bit of the entertainer in him. He can
play the saxophone on the Arsenio Hall Show, he can delight a group
of senior citizens, he can play to just about any audience. But
there's nothing entertaining about his plight since the Monica
Lewinsky story broke in January _ and yet the entire spectacle has
more in common with mass entertainment than with serious politics.
 &HT;    Some of that, to be sure, is Clinton's fault. There is little
dispute that the president has put himself in harm's way with some
of the women he has encountered over the years. And Clinton, a
fervent disciple of Kennedy's style, has merged the public and the
private in new ways. He opened his home to people he describes as
his ``friends'' but who also are big Democratic fund-raisers. He
willingly disclosed the sort of private details of his life _ not
only his preference in underwear but his mother's many marriages
and the alcohol and abuse that filled his home life as a youngster
_ that in other presidents' lives are often left to a sleuthing
biographer or historian.
 &HT;    But the storm that has engulfed the Clinton presidency since
January has been governed by the press as well, which has lunged at
unsubstantiated rumors, trailed Lewinsky and transformed her into a
woman of mystery, and added a sense of treacly melodrama to a sober
legal proceeding that has its own inherent drama.
 &HT;    This is all occurring at a time when there are few contested
issues in American life. With a strong economy, a deficit that has
disappeared and no great foreign threats, national life is quiet,
devoid of the great struggles that captivated Americans even in the
tranquil years of the 1950s, which had wars in Korea and the Middle
East, civil-rights battles in Little Rock, terrifying superpower
confrontations, a dramatic uprising in Hungary and the launching of
the space age with the Soviet Sputnik satellite.
 &HT;    Modern politics is infused with entertainment values because
modern politics is infused with media influences. The pace, tone
and timbre of the House and Senate changed once their deliberations
were televised; Gore and Newt Gingrich were among the first to
recognize the power that televised sessions provided, and both
became grandstanders _ and powerful figures _ as a result.
 &HT;    The advent of cable television, which was supposed to provide
``local access'' to lower levels of government, also changed the
way politics is conducted.
 &HT;    ``Because of that, politicians play to the camera,'' says State
Assemblyman Bill Campbell of California, a first-term Republican
who represents southeastern Orange County. ``More people speak, and
they speak longer than they would otherwise. People play to the
tube.''
 &HT;    Yet the rush to entertain has killed the entertainment in
politics _ and has made politics less appealing than ever. This
autumn as many as 100 House members may run unopposed. The major
parties simply were not able to find anyone to challenge the
incumbents in nearly a quarter of the House districts in the
nation.
 &HT;    ``It takes a major effort now to convince anyone to run for
public office,'' says Durbin, the Illinois senator. ``The intrusion
into your private life is too great. Politics has reached such a
low level that people just can't stomach the idea of going into
politics.
 &HT;    ``I spend time on the phone, begging people to run for all sorts
of offices,'' he continues. ``It's a very hard sell. They don't
know whether they want to put themselves or their families through
this. You either have to be flawless or prepared to see your flaws
on the front page of the paper.''
 &HT;    And then people don't think they can get anything accomplished
even if they are elected. ``People always ask: Do you get anything
done up there? Can you make a difference?'' says Sen. Bob Kerrey of
Nebraska, who heads the Senate Democratic Campaign Committee. He
says he answers yes.
 &HT;    He's probably right. This year the lawmakers have dealt with
issues such as the budget surplus, whether to overhaul the campaign
finance system, what the minimum wage should be and how much money
should be spent on thousands of line items in the 13 appropriations
bills that get almost no attention anywhere.
 &HT;    Those are real decisions involving real people. In the end,
that's politics. That's not entertainment.

 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 FROM: The Boston Globe Magazine  
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It's a bright Saturday morning in Boston. Just off the Public
Garden, in the health club of the Four Seasons Hotel, two men climb
onto exercise bikes and fiddle with the little TV sets at the
consoles.
 &HT;    Barry MacLean, who runs a large family business in Illinois and
has had his share of frustrations with Washington bureaucracy,
tunes in to cartoons. At the next bike, William Neukom, Microsoft's
chief lawyer in its landmark legal battle with the Justice
Department, tunes in to a C-Span rebroadcast of a presidential
speech.
 &HT;    A moment later, Neukom looks at MacLean's console, then at his
own and mutters, ``What's the difference? It's all entertainment.''
 &HT;    A month later, in the swish setting of the Primi Piatti
restaurant, a few blocks from the White House on Washington's
Pennsylvania Avenue, Warren Beatty is poking at his pasta and
bantering with a handful of capital columnists and TV
correspondents.
 &HT;    There, amid talk of President Clinton's woes and Beatty's movie
``Bulworth,'' the actor has an epiphany: ``There is no difference
anymore between Hollywood and Washington. They are both totally
into the sound bite. One is no more superficial than the other.
Even this whole process of yakking to people about this movie is
really no different from what you'd be doing if you were running
for office.''
 &HT;    Politics. Entertainment. Politics as entertainment. The
distinction between the two, never sharp, is today less well
defined than ever. Once, the presidency was a documentary shown in
prime time; now it has degenerated into a soap opera for afternoon
television.
 &HT;    Once, campaign advertising complemented stump speeches and
position papers; in some races today, the ads virtually replace
stump speeches and position papers. Once, news shows provided a
sober intermission between situation comedies and full-length
feature films; now they have taken on characteristics of both.
 &HT;    ``We are now reaching a point,'' says Sen. Richard Durbin,
Democrat of Illinois, ``where the line between entertainment and
news is blurring.''
 &HT;    In technology as in entertainment, the word for this phenomenon
is ``convergence.'' And what politics and entertainment
increasingly have in common is not only that they reward style more
than content; not only that they seek to manipulate rather than
simply to persuade; not only that they pander rather than
challenge; not only that they reward celebrity and avoid searching
questions.
 &HT;    All those things are true, but the most important similarity
between modern entertainment and modern politics is what is, in a
sense, most un-American about them both: They are passive
experiences.
 &HT;    Like entertainment, politics is increasingly part of the
easy-listening background music of the time _ always present, not
particularly adventuresome, seldom very important. Like
entertainment, politics is increasingly a show of special effects.
Like entertainment, politics is increasingly modified by the word
``virtual.'' And, like entertainment, politics has become something
that other people do.
 &HT;    This movement of politics from the active mode to the passive
has grave implications for American civic life and for the health
of our democratic system. It is, moreover, an important departure
for a nation that was born in the activism of the 18th-century
revolutionaries, that conducted the signature debates of the modern
age in public, that at every turn decided to expand its visions of
freedom and liberty rather than to constrict them _ and that
throughout its history broadened, rather than diminished, its
definition of ``rights.''
 &HT;    ``We are in danger of becoming a nation of spectators,'' warned
The National Commission on Civic Renewal, based in College Park,
Md., which for a year studied American civic life.
 &HT;    There's always been a bit of entertainment in politics and a bit

 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON When the Iraqis pulled the plug on U.N. weapons
inspections in January, President Clinton threatened a missile
shower unless Saddam Hussein backed down. When the Iraqis did it
again last month, Clinton belched some dragon smoke while showing
he had no fire left in his belly.
</P>
<P>
   Why the turnabout?
</P>
<P>
   Petulant claims that policy over Iraq hasn't changed in the
intervening months suggests Clinton doesn't restrict his fibs to
sex scandals. Could it be that internal threats of survival in
office have so weakened presidential resolve that he can no longer
make good on this external threat?
</P>
<P>
   And yet possible impeachment or resignation were also in the air
back in January, when the Iraqi crisis shared the headlines with
Monica Lewinsky. Both topics receded after U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan cut a deal with Saddam even as Clinton denied having an
affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has formed
her own mantra: Saddam is being ``safely kept safely in his box.''
What that really means is Washington won't allow lifting the oil
embargo against Iraq so long as Saddam remains in power.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the embargo, oil is leaking out of Iraq and into Turkey
and Iran at rates that would put prize leak-monger Matt Drudge to
shame. In the West, such sales deepen an oil glut that has driven
inflation-adjusted prices to record lows. In Baghdad, they
underwrite Saddam's unsated appetite for weapons, power and land _
the very reason why an American-led coalition fought the Persian
Gulf war in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   A more confident secretary of state wouldn't have felt
constrained to attack Scott Ritter, the former U.N. arms inspector
who resigned last month after charging that Washington had blocked
his efforts to perform his job in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, it isn't possible to know what Iraq is hiding
nowadays because the Iraqis never accurately reported what they had
to start with. But a recent talk with Ritter reveals that Iraq is
hiding all the key parts _ save only the uranium core _ of three
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter also says there's evidence that Iraq tested biological
weapons on human guinea pigs in 1995. And there's further evidence,
he adds, that the Iraqis have been testing chemical weapons in
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Defector reports, Ritter says, suggest that Saddam is now in a
position to make al-Husayn ballistic missiles _ within six months
of a final ``go to production'' order _ that could strike any
Middle East target.
</P>
<P>
   Since Iraq changes its concealment mechanism every 30 days,
rapid collection of data and rapid action are vitally needed to
keep Saddam penned ``in his box.'' Ritter asserts pressure from on
high to cut corners and stop probing concealment techniques
frustrated the inspectors and led him to quit as a team leader.
</P>
<P>
   If the underlying reasons for backtracking on Iraq are above
Ritter's pay grade, as Albright maintains, that does not serve to
legitimize them.
</P>
<P>
   There's no stomach in either Arab palaces or in the Arab street
to take on Saddam. Sadly, Clinton feels powerless to change that
reality without incurring costs that, at this point, he's unwilling
to pay.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Life has changed for the big men of small countries. Gone are
the days when a thuggish Third World leader could find a superpower
to support him, if only because the other didn't.
 &HT;    Thirteen years ago, when Hun Sen first became prime minister of
Cambodia, it was as the puppet of Vietnam and the Soviet Union, and
they were not particularly bothered by political killings or a lack
of elections. (The United States was equally indifferent to the
corruption and abuses of Lon Nol, the Cambodian dictator it
supported in the early 1970s.)
 &HT;    But with the Cold War over, things changed. The United Nations
moved in; an election was held in 1993 and, until last year, Hun
Sen ruled Cambodia in coalition with his co-prime minister and
political rival, Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
 &HT;    In July 1997, however, Hun Sen staged a military coup, ousting
Ranariddh and killing at least 41 of the prince's military and
political allies. This violated the rules of the post-Cold War
world, which call for democracy _ at least in a small and poor
country.
 &HT;    Largely at the urging of Congress, Washington cut off foreign
aid to his government (it continued to help finance Cambodia's
buzzing civil society) and stopped the United Nations from awarding
him Cambodia's U.N. seat.
 &HT;    The Association of South East Asian Nations, or Asean, which had
been considering Cambodia for membership, abruptly froze its bid.
 &HT;    These slights were a problem for a man who craved respect, got
half his budget from foreign aid and had been cut off by the
International Monetary Fund because of corruption. The solution was
an election. He held it on July 26 _ and apparently got everything
he wanted.
 &HT;    International observers took note of the killings of activists
from opposition parties, of Hun Sen's monopoly over television and
radio, of his control of the electoral machinery, of his party's
bribes and widespread intimidation of voters. A nd they approved
the election anyway.
 &HT;    The speed and enthusiasm of the world's embrace raises troubling
questions about whether it is democracy or merely its appearance
that the world demands, and whether the international rules are any
less cynical today than during the Cold War.
 &HT;    I came to Cambodia to watch the election and to interview Hun
Sen, an interview suggested and arranged by his American lawyers
and his public-relations adviser. Bretton Sciaroni, an American
working in Phnom Penh as a lawyer for Hun Sen's Cambodian People's
Party, or CPP, said that Hun Sen's PR makeover began following the
July '97 coup.
 &HT;    ''After the fighting last summer, they (the CPP) couldn't get
their side of the story out,'' he said. Sciaroni was once a lawyer
in the Reagan White House. Now he was standing in a schoolyard on
election morning, waiting for Hun Sen to vote. ``My conservative
brethren don't understand my involvement with the CPP,'' he said.
``I would argue the CPP is more pro-free enterprise.'' There was a
pause. ``But ideology has nothing to do with it. It's all power.''
 &HT;    A succinct description of what drives Cambodian politics.
Sciaroni wrote a long paper giving Hun Sen's side of the coup. To
help in Washington, he hired James C. Stearns, a lawyer with
Porter, Wright, Morris &AMP; Arthur. Stearns, in turn, brought along
the law firm of Arnold &AMP; Porter and David Morey, a corporate
strategist.
 &HT;    A letter filed with the Justice Department's foreign-agent
registry says these consultants will get a total of $550,000 for
five months' work, ending next month.
 &HT;    They held dinners in Washington for visiting CPP officials and
supporters of Hun Sen. ``We're advising them on free elections,''
Morey told me over lunch in Phnom Penh. One of Morey's associates
said, ``We are working with Hun Sen on human rights.'' Speaking of
the time I would have to meet with Hun Sen, Stearns said that his
advisers were rearranging his campaign schedule so I could see him
``with his best foot forward.''
 -0- 
 &HT;    The client is a PR challenge. since the Khmer Rouge came to
power in 1975, Cambodia has suffered under an assortment of
dreadful governments, and Hun Sen has been in all of them. He was
still a teen-ager, a peasant's son, when he joined the Khmer Rouge
guerrillas nearly 30 years ago.
 &HT;    In 1977, while a midlevel officer, he fled to Vietnam. Two years
later, when Vietnam overthrew the Khmer Rouge and installed a
government in Cambodia, Hun Sen, all of 27, was its foreign
minister. In 1985, at 33, he became prime minister.
 &HT;    Hun Sen's government was infinitely better than the psychopathic
terror of the Khmer Rouge. It was, nevertheless, a brutal Communist
dictatorship that used assassination and torture to still its
critics and controlled the country through a network of
party-appointed village chiefs.
 &HT;    The Khmer Rouge guerrillas continued their civil war. To
Washington's undying shame, it supported the Khmer Rouge claim to
be the legitimate government of Cambodia and encouraged China to
give the guerrillas aid _ because they were fighting a regime
aligned with Vietnam and the Soviet Union.
 &HT;    In 1991, Washington, Moscow and Beijing brokered a peace deal
that put an end to the 13-year civil war. The United Nations moved
in with a huge and ambitious peacekeeping operation. It spent more
than $2 billion to organize elections in 1993 and try to restore
democracy.
 &HT;    The CPP lost to Funcinpec, the royalist party led by Prince
Ranariddh, son of King Norodom Sihanouk. Hun Sen then claimed he
had been cheated and threatened to continue the civil war unless he
got a share of power. The United Nations caved in; neither the
United States nor anyone else had the stomach for battles between
U.N. and CPP troops.
 &HT;    So Hun Sen retained his control. It was an important lesson in
the pliability of the international community.
 &HT;    Over the next few years, Hun Sen learned how easy it was to
manipulate the outside world. The United Nations did not demand
that the CPP loosen its control of the army and political
structures. Hun Sen's influence was boosted by the incompetence of
Prince Ranariddh, whose only talent for leadership seemed to be
enjoying the perquisites of power.
 &HT;    But two events in 1997 shattered the world's complacency with
Hun Sen. One was the coup. The other was a grenade attack on a
peaceful political rally in Phnom Penh, killing 16 people and
narrowly missing Sam Rainsy, one of Hun Sen's most ardent critics.
Witnesses saw Hun Sen's bodyguards protect the suspects.
 &HT;    The only investigation _ by the American FBI _ was halted
prematurely and the results have never been released. Even a number
of Hun Sen's supporters told me they believed the bombing was the
work of those close to him.
 -0- 
 &HT;    My interview with Hun Sen took place on Election Day in his new
house, a huge peach-colored stucco mansion about 10 miles from
Phnom Penh. The sitting room was decorated in ornate Louis XIV
style, with white sculpted chairs, crystal chandeliers, marble
floors, flowered rugs and cabinets full of expensive-looking silver
bowls and sculptures. The grounds featured Versailles-style
gardens, fish ponds and coconut groves. He has another house in
town.
 &HT;    The cabinet behind his office desk displays honorary degrees
from American schools _ one, I later learned, from an unaccredited
correspondence school. There were also pictures of his children,
who by fall will all be studying in France and America, one of them
at West Point. Sciaroni, Morey and Stearns sat with us.
 &HT;    Hun Sen was well briefed. His answers were direct and well
organized, mercifully absent the hourlong monologue that normally
kicks off an interview with him. He stuck to his message: Hun Sen,
democrat. I brought up Washington.
 &HT;    ``We agree with each other on democracy, pluralism and respect
for human rights,'' he said, smiling.
 &HT;    The grenade attack on the Sam Rainsy rally, he implied, was
carried out by a member of the royalist party, Funcinpec. Asked
about the coup, he took out two maps from his desk and went through
an intricate account of provocation by Ranariddh and the Khmer
Rouge. When I left he gave me a souvenir watch with his picture on
it.
 &HT;    The centerpiece of Hun Sen's attempt to remake himself as a
democrat was the elections themselves. Although Hun Sen claims
authorship, he had to be pushed into elections by the more moderate
wing of the CPP, which believed the party's nationwide machine
would assure victory. Still, Hun Sen had balked. Even a month
before the election, he was still trying to get Ranariddh's party
disqualified.
 &HT;    The election would not have happened at all without the cajoling
of foreign diplomats, including an unprecedented effort by the
Asean nations, who usually refrain from meddling in the political
affairs of Asian countries. Nevertheless, the campaign climate was
so lopsided that a pre-election statement issued by the National
Democratic Institute and the International Republican Institute,
the American monitoring groups, called the process ``fundamentally
flawed.''
 &HT;    Hun Sen's control of broadcasting was one reason. The U.N.
human-rights office in Cambodia, which tracked media appearances,
found that in the month of May, Hun Sen and CPP officials were on
the air 448 times, mostly shown handing out goodies. Funcinpec and
Sam Rainsy party officials had a total of 14 appearances, most of
them treated negatively. Local election committees and polling
stations were run by CPP-appointed village chiefs.
 &HT;    I met people who had been given clothes and food in exchange for
promises to vote CPP, and others who had been threatened, forced to
join the party and warned of the consequences if the CPP lost. The
U.N. human-rights office, which Hun Sen has repeatedly tried to
close, tracked scores of suspected political murders between the
coup and the election. None have been investigated.
 &HT;    The CPP, which won only 41 percent of the vote, boosted its
total from 59 to 64 parliamentary seats _ 2 more than a majority _
by using a new formula to allocate seats. Funcinpec and Sam
Rainsy's party alleged that the vote count had been ruined by
ballot-stuffing, deliberate miscounting or other fraud.
 &HT;    Losers always cry fraud in Cambodia, but there was enough
evidence of mischief during the vote count to make the allegations
credible. It would have taken a thorough investigation to determine
whether the incidents of fraud were widespread enough to have
altered the outcome. Yet the international community quickly
declared the election valid.
 &HT;    The American monitoring groups, who had long-term monitors in
Cambodia throughout the campaign, issued a written statement saying
that the ``relative success'' of balloting and counting could not
negate the violence and unfairness of the campaign, but that the
Cambodian people had overcome those obstacles and held a
``successful exercise in national self-determination.''
 &HT;    That was overshadowed, however, by the news-conference ad lib of
Stephen Solarz, the former congressman and a leader of the
delegation, who said that if the opposition charges proved
unfounded, history could one day call the election ``the miracle on
the Mekong.''
 &HT;    He also implied that after an investigation of the opposition's
claims, Hun Sen should get his Asean membership, foreign aid and
U.N. seat.
 &HT;    The other foreign monitors were even more enthusiastic. Two days
before the vote, a U.N.-sponsored monitoring group with delegates
from dozens of countries said conditions for the elections were
``reasonable.'' The day after the election, it called the voting
and counting ``free and fair to an extent that enables it to
reflect, in a credible way, the will of the Cambodian people.''
 &HT;    Sven Linder, the Swedish diplomat who was the spokesman for the
group, said at the news conference: ``We traced no tensions in the
air. We have not traced any atmosphere of intimidation.''
 &HT;    The positive tone prevailed, perhaps, because most monitors
spent only the week around the election in Cambodia, and for that
period the CPP largely behaved. Cambodians, who are rarely asked
their opinions on anything, had a voter turnout of more than 90
percent and told observers they were thrilled to be able to choose
a good government.
 &HT;    Their dignity and enthusiasm for democracy moved observers. But
the observers' emotional reaction may have caused them to overlook
the unfairness of the campaign. They tended to forget how ill
equipped outsiders were to spot problems.
 &HT;    Villagers were warned not to talk to foreigners. It is
impossible, even at less charged times than Election Day, to have a
private conversation in the claustrophobic and controlled
atmosphere of a Cambodian village, and anyone suspected of talking
about mischief would be in danger.
 &HT;    My visits to villages convinced me that I could gain no idea
what was going on under the surface. Although there was a network
of domestic observers, there were only 500 teams of foreign
observers for 11,000 polling places.
 &HT;    Carol Armstrong, executive director of the U.S.-Thailand
Business Council and an American monitor, said: ``The premature
judgment on the election by the international community was
throwing away 12 months of documented cases of intimidation and
human rights abuses for two days.''
 -0- 
 &HT;    Solarz was crucial to the success of the 1991 Cambodian peace
accords that led to the 1993 elections and was the Clinton
administration's special envoy to Cambodia after the coup. His
involvement may have encouraged him to look on the bright side. He
also had a potential conflict of interest stemming from his
position as a senior counselor at the Washington lobbying firm Apco
Associates.
 &HT;    The Legal Times of Washington reported last year that in 1995
Solarz participated in a pitch meeting with Ranariddh to represent
Cambodia in Washington. Apco then registered with the Justice
Department as a foreign agent representing Cambodia. Apco failed to
get the job, however; perhaps the contract required Hun Sen's
approval.
 &HT;    Solarz denied that these business efforts created a conflict.
``My relationship to Cambodia goes back a long time,'' he said ``If
anything, I'm biased in favor of the opposition.''
 &HT;    The calm of Election Day provided cover for other observers who
had political reasons to endorse the election. U.N. monitors were
never given detailed information about the abuses of the campaign
period before they arrived.
 &HT;    When team leaders from each country met before the election to
write a statement about the campaign period, the Asian delegates
argued against pointing out any problems. When the delegates met
again on counting day, most of the Europeans argued against using
``free and fair.''
 &HT;    But delegates from France and Asian nations _ which included
such dictatorships as China, Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam _ disagreed.
Asean members, in particular, argued that European standards should
not apply.
 &HT;    ``Asean wants to admit Cambodia as a member as soon as they
possible can,'' one Western diplomat said. ``A minimally credible
election would be enough.''
 &HT;    Some who found the election legitimate argued that it had to be
seen in context. The world, after all, had accepted Suharto in
Indonesia, even though his elections featured no real opposition at
all. Intimidation was nothing new in Cambodian political culture.
Ranariddh, moreover, promised nothing better. He preferred golf to
working and surrounded himself with courtiers.
 &HT;    ``The international community decided that Ranariddh was a
buffoon,'' said one Western diplomat.
 &HT;    The American Ambassador Kenneth Quinn was widely perceived as
pro-Hun Sen, but most of the important ambassadors in Phnom Penh
felt that Hun Sen was the key to stability, one high-ranking
Cambodian official told me.
 &HT;    ``They work with who has the power,'' he said. ``Hun Sen became
the interlocutor.'' The quality of the election was irrelevant, and
he knew it.
 &HT;    The United Nations and European nations have their own reasons
for endorsing the election. The U.N. spent more than $2 billion to
try to make Cambodia a democracy five years ago. This year, the
European Union spent nearly $12 million on the election.
 &HT;    ``There's real Cambodia fatigue,'' one European diplomat said.
``It's been 20 years or so, and a lot of effort and time has gone
into helping to fix Cambodia. People are turning away and want a
solution.''
 -0- 
 &HT;    It remains to be seen what kind of solution Hun Sen can offer,
what kind of stability can come from a leader whose strongman rule
is blocking the creation of the institutions needed for long-term
stability. After the election, hundreds of opposition activists
were threatened and fled their villages.
 &HT;    Two weeks ago, Cambodia's own National Election Commission,
which is stuffed with Hun Sen supporters, rejected almost all the
opposition claims summarily. And on Aug. 20, one man died in a
gun-and-grenade attack at a Sam Rainsy-led protest outside the
Interior Ministry.
 &HT;    How the world will treat Cambodia has also not yet been settled,
but it seems as though Hun Sen will be accorded the legitimacy he
wanted. Cambodia has been a laboratory for the international
community, which succeeded in pushing Hun Sen to adopt the
trappings of democracy. And even those may evaporate completely
once the world turns away.
 &HT;    But the real manipulation went in the other direction, as Hun
Sen got the world's endorsement for an election that was neither
free nor fair. The mouse, after all, also trains the scientist.
When he rings the bell, the good doctor brings him cheese.

 By DAVID OSHINSKY  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    The town of Philadelphia, Miss., can't quite escape its past.
Like Selma, Ala., and Howard Beach, N.Y., it has come to symbolize
the racial violence that tears at America to this day.
 &HT;    In the summer of 1964, Michael Schwerner, James Chaney and
Andrew Goodman were shot and killed in rural Neshoba County, just
outside Philadelphia, by members of the Ku Klux Klan. Although the
FBI compiled enough evidence to convict seven men on federal
charges of violating the civil rights of the victims, the state of
Mississippi never brought anyone to trial on murder charges.
 &HT;    ``A day doesn't go by that I don't think about those boys,''
says Stan Dearman, longtime editor of The Neshoba Democrat, ``and
wonder if justice will be done.''
 &HT;    What, exactly, does justice entail? For some, the federal
convictions were justice enough. In 1989, Mississippi's secretary
of state, Dick Molpus, a Philadelphia native, made an emotional
apology at a memorial service attended by relatives of the victims.
 &HT;    ``We deeply regret what happened here 25 years ago,'' Molpus
declared. For many, this was more than enough.
 &HT;    Dearman disagrees. He believes that justice requires a murder
trial in Neshoba County, and it is possible that he will get his
wish. The push for a criminal prosecution may be aided by material
in the newly opened files of the State Sovereignty Commission.
 &HT;    Created in 1956 to defend Mississippi from ``encroachment by the
federal government,'' the commission spent two decades monitoring
those suspected of supporting racial integration before it was
abolished in 1977. The files, which contain 87,000 names, are
mostly about the harassment of ordinary people.
 &HT;    Yet they also provide a remarkable window onto a series of Klan
killings in the 1960s, including those of Medgar Evers and Vernon
Dahmer, the prominent civil-rights leaders, as well as those of
Schwerner, Chaney and Goodman. There are no smoking guns in the
Neshoba case _ nothing to indicate that someone in state government
had prior knowledge of the murder plot, took part in the crime or
tried to cover it up.
 &HT;    But the files reveal a deep hatred of the civil-rights workers
who reached Mississippi in 1964 and a level of surveillance
probably unprecedented in the nation's history. Equally important,
the files show that state investigators, working independently of
the FBI, came up with similar information regarding the murder
suspects in Neshoba.
 &HT;    The federal government chose to prosecute on the charges
available to it (violation of civil rights); the state chose not
to, on the charges in its purview (murder).
 -0- 
 &HT;    The facts in the case are well known. Schwerner, a Cornell
graduate, had gone to Mississippi with his wife, Rita, to work for
the Congress of Racial Equality.
 &HT;    Opening a community center in Meridian, the young couple taught
black children to read and write while encouraging their parents to
register and vote.
 &HT;    Chaney, 21, was a frequent visitor at the center and quickly
became Schwerner's confidant. In June 1964, Schwerner and Chaney
drove to Oxford, Ohio, to help train volunteers for a huge
voter-registration drive in Mississippi, known as Freedom Summer.
There they befriended Goodman, a 20-year-old white college student
from New York.
 &HT;    Reaching Mississippi on June 20, the three men spent the next
day inspecting the ruins of a black church near Philadelphia that
had been firebombed by the Klan.
 &HT;    That afternoon they were arrested for ``speeding'' by Neshoba
County's deputy sheriff, Cecil Price. According to extensive
testimony at the federal trial, Price sent out word that those
arrested included ``Goatee'' _ the Klan's code name for Schwerner,
who had been marked for death by the Imperial Wizard, Sam Bowers
(who was just convicted for the murder of Dahmer on Aug. 21).
 &HT;    Price held the civil-rights workers long enough for Edgar Ray
Killen, a preacher and, according to the FBI, local Klan leader, to
round up a posse. As Schwerner, Chaney and Goodman headed down
Route 19 that evening, Price tailed them in his cruiser, followed
by two carloads of Klansmen.
 &HT;    After a frantic chase, the three men were caught, taken to an
isolated spot on Rock Cut Road, murdered in quick succession and
buried below an earthen dam on the farm of Olen Burrage, one of
Philadelphia's wealthiest citizens. Their Ford wagon was set
ablaze.
 &HT;    The three bodies were discovered six weeks later, following one
of the largest FBI manhunts in history. Near the end of the year,
federal agents arrested 19 men for conspiring to deny Schwerner,
Chaney and Goodman their civil rights. After numerous delays, a
federal jury convicted Bowers, Price and five other defendants.
Three more went free when the jury deadlocked, including Killen;
the rest were acquitted.
 &HT;    Many people believe that state officials had no desire to see an
explosive murder trial in Neshoba County, where the probable
outcome _ mass acquittals _ would embarrass Mississippi once again.
They realized too that a trial could easily unmask their own roles
in this tragedy _ the roles of leaders who fanned the hysterical,
and ultimately lethal, resistance to civil rights in the South's
most segregated state. The Neshoba killings remain officially
``unsolved.'' The leading suspects are still alive.
 &HT;    Although ``local people'' such as Evers and Dahmer formed the
backbone of the civil-rights movement in Mississippi, it is
Schwerner, Chaney and Goodman who remain the most visible martyrs
to that cause. Fairly or not, their case offers the best chance for
redemption and closure on the national stage.

 &HT;    In the newly released files is a 1964 ``talk'' by Erle Johnston,
the Sovereignty Commission director, to a group of business
leaders, marked ``Absolutely Restricted,'' about preparations to
neutralize the Council of Federated Organizations, or COFO, the
umbrella group behind Mississippi's Freedom Summer.
 &HT;    ``Through our investigative staff and other sources of
information,'' he said, ``the Sovereignty Commission has been fully
informed about COFO's plans.'' Johnston wasn't boasting. The files
show that commission informants had thoroughly infiltrated COFO.
 &HT;    One informant supplied copies of the Freedom Summer application
forms, which included a biographical sketch of each civil-rights
worker and _ more important _ a photograph. Others forwarded the
notes they had scribbled at COFO meetings. The most valuable
source, known as ``Agent X,'' attended the COFO training sessions
in Ohio and also supplied the descriptions and tag numbers of COFO
vehicles in Mississippi, which the Sovereignty Commission then
distributed to local police officers, many of whom, as in Neshoba,
belonged to the Ku Klux Klan.
 &HT;    One such vehicle, ``a '63 Ford Station Wagon bearing Mississippi
license plate number H 25503,'' was the car Schwerner, Chaney and
Goodman were driving when they were stopped for speeding by Deputy
Price.
 &HT;    Some view Agent X, identified in recent press reports as R.L.
Bolden, a local black man with ties to the civil-rights movement,
as an accessory to murder. (Bolden has refused to be interviewed.)
Yet Agent X was hardly alone in putting the lives of these
civil-rights workers at risk.
 &HT;    The Sovereignty Commission files reveal that the Schwerners were
being monitored by law enforcement within weeks of their arrival in
Mississippi. A detailed report by the commission's top
investigator, Andrew Hopkins, on March 23, 1964, gives precise
descriptions of both Schwerners, their local address, choice of
clothing (``dungarees'' and a ``CORE button'') and current
employment (encouraging blacks to vote). It concludes that the
Meridian police are ``keeping these subjects under surveillance and
are getting information from reliable informants.''
 &HT;    The Sovereignty Commission dispatched Hopkins to Philadelphia a
few days after the civil-rights workers disappeared. His
confidential reports, written by someone who changed his thinking
over time, provide a unique look at the murders. A devoted
segregationist, with strong ties to the local police, Hopkins at
first accepted the prevailing white opinion that the three
``agitators'' had faked their disappearance to gain publicity for
Freedom Summer.
 &HT;    ``There is still no physical evidence that (they) have met with
foul play,'' he noted on July 3, ``other than the burned out car
which could very easily be part of a hoax.''
 &HT;    Hopkins resented the FBI's presence in Neshoba County. He
complained that the bureau did not seek the aid of Mississippi
officials, and he accused individual agents of browbeating
suspects. Yet the more Hopkins learned from his informants, the
better the FBI's case appeared.
 &HT;    State investigators, using multiple sources, were told that six
to eight Klansmen were directly involved in the killings, including
``law enforcement people'' and ``a minister.'' Hopkins found that
the bureau had ``every one'' of these suspects under close
surveillance.
 &HT;    On Aug. 6, two days after the bodies were discovered, he
admitted that the FBI did not need his information about the case _
``they already had most of it.'' His report of Aug. 6, one of the
key documents in these files, appears to contain what until now was
the bureau's most closely guarded secret _ the identity of the
person who broke open the case by revealing where the bodies were
buried. All that had been known was that the FBI had paid the
individual $30,000 and had promised to protect his identity.
 &HT;    ``I have information from a confidential source,'' Hopkins
wrote, ``that Mr. Olen Burrage ... directed the FBI to the spot
where the bodies were buried. ... The informant stated that Mr.
Burrage received $30,000 from the FBI for this information.''
Burrage was indicted on federal conspiracy charges, but not
convicted. (Burrage did not respond to repeated requests for
comment.)
 &HT;    When the 19 arrests were made, Hopkins was mildly surprised. He
had expected an additional police official to be booked, but he
hadn't imagined so many arrests beyond the actual participants at
Rock Cut Road. His final report in 1964 describes the FBI's case in
meticulous detail and criticizes the bureau on one major count _
its strong-arm tactics against suspects who refused to confess.
 -0- 
 &HT;    Philadelphia, a town of about 7,000 people, looks today much as
it did on that blistering Sunday afternoon 34 years ago when Price
made his fateful arrest. The old markers are there _ the red-brick
county courthouse, the shops lining the main square, the storefront
offices of the lawyers who represented the Neshoba defendants at
the federal trial.
 &HT;    The big difference around Philadelphia is the Silver Star Resort
and Casino, three miles west of town. Owned by the Choctaw Indians
and opened in 1994, it provides Neshoba County with millions in
revenue and hundreds of jobs.
 &HT;    If the Silver Star represents the glittering future, then the
civil-rights killings mark the bitter past. Most whites say they
believe that a murder trial today would needlessly reopen old
wounds.
 &HT;    A lawyer tells me: ``We're a small town. A few years ago, my
little girl got on the wrong school bus and was lost. Cecil Price
spent hours searching for her until she was found.'' He adds: ``I
believe that murder must be punished, but I just don't know what
good it would do to put Cecil in jail again after all these
years.''
 &HT;    A trial, however, would have real meaning for local blacks such
as the Rev. Clint Collier, a Methodist minister who spent much of
his life battling for civil rights. For his labors, Collier was
arrested, fired from his teaching job and swindled out of much of
his land. Today, at 89, he vividly recalls the meetings with
Schwerner, who spoke about the prospect of being killed, and the
mean swagger of local police officers. He remembers Price telling
him, several years ago, about being ``brainwashed'' by the Klan.
 &HT;    ``Have you repented?'' Collier asked him. ``Are you teaching
your boy to do right?'' Price supposedly said yes. ``That's good,''
Collier declared.
 &HT;    ``That's all you can do.''
 &HT;    In 1989, Collier listened with disappointment as Molpus
apologized for the killings. ``I want punishment,'' Collier says,
pausing to let the anger pass. ``I want justice.''
 -0- 
 &HT;    Edgar Ray Killen still lives in Neshoba County. I phoned him at
his farm. He told me that he didn't give interviews, yet he seemed
in no hurry to hang up. After chatting briefly, we agreed to meet
at a local store. Killen and his wife arrived in a rusted pickup
truck. Wearing his trademark cowboy hat, with a plug of tobacco in
his cheek, he looked remarkably fit for a man of 73 _ lean,
well-muscled, deeply tanned. He shook hands warmly and invited me,
my 20-year-old son, Matthew, and the photographer who was with us
to supper.
 &HT;    Killen lives in the hills southeast of Philadelphia, a stone's
throw from Rock Cut Road. ``I've always preached the same way,'' he
said. ``I brag on Jesus.''
 &HT;    Like some white Southerners, Killen viewed the civil-rights
movement as part of a Communist conspiracy to replace biblical
truths with godless principles. In 1964, according to FBI files, he
became a founding member _ and chief recruiter _ of the local Ku
Klux Klan. According to testimony at the 1967 federal trial, Killen
was not among the group that killed Schwerner, Chaney and Goodman
on Rock Cut Road. Yet several witnesses swore that he had recruited
them for the murders.
 &HT;    ``Reverend Killen said they had three of those civil-rights
workers locked up and we had to ... tear their butts up,'' one
said. Another witness recalled a conversation with the preacher
just after the civil-rights workers disappeared. He ``told me that
they had been shot, that they were dead ... and buried in a dam
about 15 feet deep.''
 &HT;    We sat in a living room crammed with religious items. ``I'm a
right-winger who supports the Constitution as written by the
Founding Fathers,'' Killen said. Asked about the murders, he
replied: ``Those boys were Communists who went to a Communist
training school. I'm sorry they got themselves killed. But I can't
show remorse for something I didn't do.''
 &HT;    Having said exactly what he intended, the preacher got up to
check on supper. At that moment, his youngest brother, Don,
arrived, and the evening took a darker turn. Shaking my hand, Don
announced that he didn't like blacks and homosexuals (in terms not
printable in this magazine). He told me that President Clinton was
a homosexual and that Martin Luther King Jr. had been one too. The
preacher joined in, using a racial slur to describe King's
``Communist'' sympathies.
 &HT;    The remark surprised me, for he had been careful to this point.
With the formal interview now over, another side of Preacher Killen
appeared. For the next three hours, over steak and French fries,
iced tea and Kool-Aid, the brothers ranted _ about ``scientific
facts'' (lesbians lean to the left in the womb), anthropology
(blacks are mud people who belong in Africa), slavery (a good
thing) and current affairs (almost every black in the county has no
job, a boom box and his car up on blocks).
 &HT;    Close to midnight, the preacher walked us to the door. There had
been no threats or outbursts that evening, although he did ask if
we were nervous about winding up on Rock Cut Road, just like
``those boys'' in the 1960s. As we left his farm and headed down
the narrow blacktop in total darkness, one thought came eerily to
mind: This was the last thing that Schwerner, Chaney and Goodman
saw in the moments before they died.
 -0- 
 &HT;    Will these murders be prosecuted? I posed this question to
Mississippi's state attorney general, Mike Moore, 46, a moderate
Democrat with a solid record on civil rights. His office is now
aiding local prosecutors in the Dahmer killing, and the Neshoba
case would seem the logical next step.
 &HT;    Shortly after taking office in 1988, Moore faced pressure to
investigate the Neshoba murders. Hollywood had just released
``Mississippi Burning,'' which glorified the FBI for solving the
case, and The Clarion-Ledger, Mississippi's leading newspaper,
urged Moore to convene a grand jury.
 &HT;    The evidence is ``laid out for the world to see,'' it said,
``and has been since the 1967 trial.'' But it wasn't that simple.
Moore learned that some of the physical evidence _ the bullets,
fingerprints, the victims' clothing _ was missing. At the same
time, the cases of Evers and Dahmer gained local momentum, pushing
Neshoba to the side.
 &HT;    Many believe that a conviction of Bowers in the Dahmer case is
akin to his conviction in the Neshoba case, since Bowers was the
driving force behind most Klan murders in Mississippi. As Moore
says: ``Sometimes a man kills 10 people and we get him for 1. But
justice is served in the 9 other cases.''
 &HT;    What about Price, Killen and other suspects still walking the
streets? The Sovereignty Commission files will provide useful
material for a prosecutor _ not only the names and code names of
informants but also the knowledge that staunch segregationists,
using their own sources, concluded that the FBI compiled a very
solid case.
 &HT;    Thirty-four years ago, an agent expressed the hope that
``sometime in the future when they have had an opportunity to
review in detail information involving the subjects in this
matter,'' state officials would file murder charges. Perhaps, with
the opening of the files, that time has arrived.

 By FRANCISCO GOLDMAN  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Ever since the earthquake of 1972 all but razed Managua _ and
the dictator Anastasio Somoza and his cronies pocketed the millions
in international reconstruction aid _ the Nicaraguan capital has
been a city where communal memory has replaced actual architecture,
where many addresses refer to landmarks that aren't there anymore:
``From where the Lacmiel restaurant used to be, go two blocks
south. ...''
 &HT;    The house of Daniel Ortega fits this used-to-be aspect of the
city. The manor belonged to the prominent Morales family until it
was confiscated in the Sandinista revolution of 1979. Comandante
Ortega and his family moved in, converting the property into his
official residence. The high walls surrounding the compound were
painted in a military-camouflage pattern.
 &HT;    Ortega lived there throughout the 1980s as leader of the
Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN), and from 1984 to 1990
as president of Nicaragua _ and has never left, despite losing the
presidency in 1990 to Violeta Barrios de Chamorro (and again, in
1996, to Arnoldo Aleman). The only visible change made to the house
has been to the compound's walls, which have been repainted with
colorful folkloric murals.
 &HT;    Once inside the gated entrance, I was struck by how the house
still seemed more an ``official residence'' than a private one.
Having lived here for so long as the nation's ruler, Ortega must
now find it hard to resist the illusion that he remains the leader
of something besides an opposition political party.
 &HT;    Though still surrounded by the trappings of power, Ortega had
until recently all but vanished from the world's attentions. But in
March, he suddenly emerged in international headlines again,
accused by his adopted daughter, Zoilamerica Narvaez Murillo, 30,
of having sexually abused her for 12 years since the age of 11.
 &HT;    For the first time in a decade, Ortega faced the world's press
to deliver a tensely anticipated statement. This time he spoke one
subdued sentence, expressing his ``indignation.''
 &HT;    In late May, Narvaez followed up her initial charges by
initiating a criminal case and releasing 40 pages of testimony
graphically describing the misdeeds of her adoptive father.
Narvaez, a sociologist, claimed that during her mid-teens, Ortega
would tell her that someone as busy as he was needed regular sexual
release _ and that through her sacrifice she was helping the
Sandinista cause. ``I began to feel weighing on my shoulders,'' she
said, ``the unbearable and tortuous weight of the revolution.'' The
formerly pro-Sandinista newspaper El Nuevo Diario ran the entire
testimony.
 &HT;    It was a humiliating moment for Ortega, one that also
represented a calculated challenge to his power: The Narvaez
testimony's May release coincided with a partywide congress of the
FSLN. Fortunately for Ortega, the delegates closed ranks, expelling
from party posts those who publicly defended Narvaez. In the end,
the nearly 500 delegates almost unanimously re-elected him
secretary-general.
 &HT;    Ortega's wife, Rosario Murillo, also came to his defense,
announcing her intention to sue those she accused of having
``brainwashed'' Narvaez against her parents.
 &HT;    Yet Ortega's troubles are far from over. In June, a Nicaraguan
judge ruled that the National Assembly _ where Ortega leads an
often-ineffective FSLN minority _ must decide whether or not to
strip Ortega of the immunity from prosecution he enjoys as a
legislator. A commission was appointed to decide the matter; its
decision is still pending.
 &HT;    If Ortega is feeling burdened by the weight of the scandal, he
was careful not to show it to me. His entrance into the compound's
conference room was sudden and brisk.
 &HT;    At 52, he is fit and thin, betraying no sign of the heart attack
he suffered in 1994, after which he spent several months in Cuba
recuperating. Here was the same somewhat doe-eyed, earnest face of
so many past images. His manner was polite and unaffected.
 &HT;    As we sat down to talk, Ortega amiably told a story about his
mother, who as a teen-ager had been imprisoned by the National
Guard for receiving coded love letters suspected of being
political. (His father was a lifelong foe of the Somoza
dictatorship, his youngest brother, Camilo, a prominent guerrilla
leader who died in battle.)
 &HT;    But when the conversation switched from personal reminiscences
to current politics, Ortega's speech became self-conscious, and he
sometimes rambled. I had agreed with his press aide beforehand not
to discuss Narvaez's accusations _ but it was obvious what Ortega
was referring to when he described himself as ``a target for those
who want to destroy me in order to demoralize the supporters and
base of the FSLN.''
 &HT;    In public statements, Ortega continues to maintain that the
charges are part of such a plot. He says that if forced to stand
trial, he is confident of being exonerated.
 &HT;    Ortega has been with the Sandinistas from the beginning. An
anti-Somoza street tough as a teen-ager in the '60s, Ortega joined
the FSLN not long after it was established, becoming an urban
guerrilla and revolutionary bank robber. Captured by Somoza's
National Guard in 1967, he spent the next seven years in prison
before rejoining the guerrilla struggle.
 &HT;    Following the 1979 revolution, he was the leading figure on the
five-person Junta of National Reconstruction. Green-fatigued,
skinny, shy, messy-haired, in heavy black-framed glasses, he seemed
an unlikely political leader. In 1984, a mere decade after his
release from prison, he was elected president of Nicaragua.
 &HT;    The Sandinista government soon dominated U.S. foreign-policy
debates. Ortega became a figurehead of the East-West confrontation
during the endgame of the Cold War. On the right, President Reagan
floridly celebrated the contra rebels' attempt to overthrow
Ortega's ``totalitarian'' government. On the left, the Sandinistas
inspired hopes of a benevolent socialism.
 &HT;    But the economic costs of the contras' war against the
Sandinistas were devastating to those hopes. What's worse, the
conflict unleashed a contra army full of vicious human-rights
violators into the countryside.
 &HT;    Of course, Ortega's leadership was itself often brutal:
Cuban-style agricultural methods were introduced to catastrophic
effect, and individual freedoms were trampled. The inflation rate
ballooned to 30,000 percent. Shortages, rationing, civil repression
and ``states of emergency'' became the norm.
 &HT;    Despite these difficulties, Ortega emerged as a wily tactician,
a man who outmaneuvered and outlasted the Reagan administration's
scandal-riddled efforts to undermine his government.
 &HT;    By unexpectedly backing the Costa Rican president and Nobel
Peace Prize laureate Oscar Arias' Central American peace plan,
Ortega effectively brought the seven-year contra war to an end,
cleverly setting the stage for the 1990 election _ one that he
fully expected to win.
 &HT;    But Ortega's confidence was misplaced. The people of Nicaragua _
repulsed by years of fratricidal war (30,000 deaths out of a
population of 3 million) and nearly apocalyptic economic collapse _
voted overwhelmingly to end the Sandinista revolution.
 &HT;    Ortega's greatest political moment may have been his Feb. 26,
1990, concession speech. That night, Ortega stepped into the
television lights to acknowledge what had been known for hours:
that his opponent, Chamorro _ the aristocratic, devoutly Catholic
widow of a revered martyr of the struggle for democracy against the
42-year Somoza-family dictatorship _ had been elected president.
Indeed, the coalition of parties she led had outpolled the
Sandinista slate throughout the country.
 &HT;    For many Sandinistas, the electoral defeat was hard to bear.
They felt it was unjust, that it was the United States, far more
than their own mistakes and failed policies, that had destroyed
their revolution.
 &HT;    There was speculation that night that Ortega, in time-honored
Central American fashion, might call on the Sandinista army to
preserve the junta's power through force. But Ortega, his voice
breaking with emotion, promised to submit to the democratic
mandate.
 &HT;    ``We leave victorious,'' he said that night, ``because we
Sandinistas have sacrificed, have spilled blood and sweat, not to
cling to government posts, but to bring Nicaragua something it has
been denied since independence in 1821. ... We feel proud, in this
unjust world divided between weak and strong, to be giving
Nicaragua and Latin America a little bit of dignity, a little bit
of democracy, a little bit of social justice.''
 &HT;    Ortega's speech seemed to promise a new beginning for the FSLN:
a chance to regain the shattered trust of so many Nicaraguans by
playing by the new rules of democracy _ not only by assuming the
role of a loyal opposition, but also by opening the party itself to
democratic reform from within.
 &HT;    But doing so went counter to everything Ortega had learned as a
guerrilla and revolutionary leader. For him and other powerful
comandantes, opposition meant trying to ``rule from below.''
 &HT;    It was a basically violent, obstructionist idea of opposition:
summoning mobs into the streets; calling strikes; encouraging
wholesale takeovers of towns _ including Esteli, Chinandega and
Matagalpa _ by soldiers loyal to the Sandinistas. It took Chamorro
until the end of her term in 1994 to loosen Ortega's grip on the
army.
 &HT;    As Sergio Ramirez, a novelist and Ortega's vice president, told
me, ``Daniel wanted to use the old strategies to destroy the
opposition, the same ones they used on the contras during the
war.''
 &HT;    Sofia Montenegro, a former editor for Barricada, the
Sandinistas' official newspaper from 1979 until earlier this year,
said: ``What was required was open discussion of the reasons we
lost power. Ethically, this was the minimum owed to the Nicaraguan
people for the thousands of dead. Facing the people, the discussion
had to be about our own mistakes. We had to explain where we'd
messed up. Half the fault was with the gringos _ they made that war
and it was brutal. But with intellectual honesty and courage, we
had to confront what was our fault.''
 &HT;    But thanks to Ortega and his allies, that open, public
discussion never happened.
 &HT;    By now, Nicaragua has 60 percent unemployment. The Sandinistas'
original gains in literacy have vanished; another innovation, free
health care, has been abandoned. When asked why the FSLN, ``the
party of the poor,'' doesn't have more support among poor people,
Ortega said flatly that it is ``hard to organize the unemployed.''
 &HT;    Meanwhile, the poets and intellectuals who impressed so many
foreign observers _ who seemed to represent the conscience and
better side of Sandinismo _ don't have a constituency in the
country, at least when cut off from the party machinery and
gun-waving rhetoric of the FSLN.
 &HT;    Ramirez said of Ortega: ``He's self-invented. But he was never
the most gifted. Ideology filled the hole where talent should have
been.'' Ramirez said that a key to Ortega lies in his seven years
in a prison, starting when he was just 23. ``He has a prison
personality. Lonely, solitary, mistrustful, hard.''
 &HT;    One afternoon I drove to the El Modelo prison, 45 minutes
outside Managua. It is hard to imagine a bleaker-looking place:
long poultry-house-like barracks surrounded by stark empty fields
browned by the harsh sun and heat. It was here that Ortega met his
future wife, Rosario, a poet, when she visited the political
prisoners' wing.
 &HT;    Ortega told me that in the political wing, prisoners were often
kept isolated one to a cell, forced to stand all day long without
anything even to read. He recalled that political prisoners were
taken away and executed for no obvious reason and that you never
knew who might be next, creating a climate of terrifying
insecurity.
 &HT;    Ortega was released in 1974 along with other political prisoners
and flown to Cuba in exchange for the freeing of Somoza elites and
foreign diplomats kidnapped by Sandinista commandos. Four years
later, during the FSLN's final military campaigns against Somoza,
Ortega moved to Costa Rica with Murillo and her three children from
a previous marriage _ including the 11-year-old Zoilamerica.
 &HT;    Montenegro speculates that during Ortega's years in prison _ a
period he once invoked in a poem: ``I never saw Managua when
miniskirts were in fashion'' _ his emotional development was
stunted. It was that immature man, a part of him frozen in time,
who soon became obsessed with his young stepdaughter.
 &HT;    Now, as Ortega faces the greatest challenge yet to his political
existence with the scandal, it is hard not to draw the conclusion
that it is a case in which private and public morality do seem to
merge: Ortega's desire for power as an end in itself seems
inseparable from his moral corruption, his callous disregard for
his stepdaughter.
 &HT;    ``I call him the Great Destroyer,'' Montenegro said of Ortega.
''He destroyed the FSLN. He destroyed Barricada. The destroyer of
so many hopes and dreams. And he destroyed this young girl's
life.''
 &HT;    If the National Assembly refuses to lift Ortega's immunity from
prosecution, or even if the courts eventually rule against Narvaez,
then ``that will only expose to everybody the corruption of the
politicians and the courts,'' Montenegro said. ``Then they will
have condemned themselves.''
 &HT;    Narvaez's case is aimed not just at Ortega and a political
culture of cynical pacts but at the culture of machismo as well. In
Latin America, the violation of stepdaughters is in particular a
long-tolerated pathology.
 &HT;    In the initial silence of so many political leaders _ even
Sandinista opponents _ about Narvaez's accusations, in the former
silence of so many veteran Sandinistas who said they knew about
Ortega's abuse of her all along, you witness a culture of obedience
to powerful men's prerogatives.
 &HT;    Such obedience runs deep. This spring, Alejandro Bendana,
Narvaez's husband, issued a statement confessing his shame over
years of cowed passivity in the face of Ortega's abuse of his young
wife. Nicaragua is a very small place, and everybody knows
everybody else's secrets, and that's another reason for politicians
and even religious leaders not to sound too self-righteous about
other people's problems.
 &HT;    But Montenegro doubts that Ortega's political career will
survive the scandal. By June, he seemed so weakened that President
Aleman, perhaps sensing an easy ``kill,'' personally called on his
Liberal Party legislators, who have a large majority in the
Assembly, to vote to revoke Ortega's immunity from prosecution. If
Aleman gets his way, Ortega could soon find himself back inside a
jail cell.
 &HT;    ``In the end, Zoilamerica is going to do to Daniel what Somoza,
Reagan and the contras never could,'' Montenegro said. ``But even
if he remains secretary-general of the party, so what? Who's going
to want to meet with him? Who's going to want to have their picture
taken with him? Qaddafi and Saddam _ polygamists! He's not going to
be able to go anywhere. He's condemned to be the prisoner of
Nicaragua.''

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    What popped into your mind when you first read the headlines
about Viagra? Well, I thought about that too.
 &HT;    But as a typical, fun-loving economist I also found myself
wondering how the Commerce Department would account for the wonder
drug in its estimates of the gross domestic product _ and from
there wandered into a reverie about the meaning of economic
progress.
 &HT;    Government statisticians will, of course, have no difficulty
slotting Viagra into their estimates of ``nominal'' GDP, the sum
total of all the money spent in the economy. Viagra's contribution
will simply be the total amount that people spend on the pills, or,
equivalently, the profits earned and wages paid in the drug's
manufacture and distribution.
 &HT;    What's more, we can be pretty sure that Viagra's numbers, while
music to the stockholders' ears, will make very little difference
to the national totals. The new drug's spectacular sales are small
change in an $8 trillion economy. And besides, most of the spending
on this new product will come at the expense of spending on other
things _ say, romantic vacations and candlelight dinners.
 &HT;    But nominal GDP doesn't tell us much. Most of the time, the
economic number we care about is ``real,'' or inflation-adjusted,
GDP, which is supposed to measure the purchasing power as opposed
to the dollar income of the economy. Basically, nominal GDP is
converted into real GDP by dividing it by a price index _ a
``deflator'' _ that is supposed to measure the average cost of
goods and services sold in the economy.
 &HT;    So far, so good. But what happens with the introduction of
Viagra, or Propecia, or whatever the next big thing may be?
 &HT;    Statisticians can't compare the prices of these drugs with what
they were last year because they weren't around last year. So
inevitably, estimates of the deflator take account only of the
goods that have been around for at least a little while.
 &HT;    So what? Well, this year some men can buy something they wanted
pretty badly _ or baldly, in the case of Propecia _ and they can
get it at a reasonable price. Last year they couldn't buy what the
pills provide at any price, and probably would have gladly spent
far more at clinics or in therapy to get lesser results. So surely,
in some sense, the nation's purchasing power has increased because
of the availability of those pills.
 &HT;    Yet the numbers you see on real GDP don't reflect that increase
_ and they never will. Eventually Viagra will be in the index, and
as its price falls in the face of competition, the deflator will
fall and measured real income will rise. But at no point will the
statistics ever capture the big payoff, the one that happened when
Viagra became available for $10 a, um, pop.
 &HT;    How could the statisticians get this right? It would have to
involve a subjective evaluation: Each person would have to be
asked, and would have to answer truthfully, the question ``How much
money would you have spent last year (with your ever-growing bald
spot and that other problem) to be as satisfied as you are now?''
 &HT;    Averaging over the population, we would come up with a true
measure of the change in the cost of living, and we would deflate
GDP by that.
 &HT;    In fact, where they can, the statisticians do try to do
something more or less along these lines, adjusting the price of
automobiles and many other products by imputations for improved
quality. But nearly everyone admits that the imputations fall well
short of capturing the real improvement in living standards.
 &HT;    Officially, the median family in 1996 had only slightly higher
real income than it did in 1973; in reality, that median family
would be extremely upset if forced to go back to a 1973 standard of
living (no VCR, no microwave, no ATMs).
 &HT;    So what's the moral? Should we smugly assume that the official
statistics understate economic progress, that the New Economy is
speeding us to a new age of economic bliss? Not so fast. For one
thing, it is by no means clear that our age of technological
marvels is any more marvelous than the age our parents,
grandparents or great-grandparents lived in.
 &HT;    Viagra is only the latest in a long line of medical miracles _
antibiotics, smallpox vaccine, anesthesia _ just as the Internet is
only the latest in a line that goes back to the fax machine, the
telephone and the telegraph. While the statistics do understate
today's true rate of economic progress, they always have.
 &HT;    but there is a deeper point. the value of Viagra is not a
dollar-and-cents issue. Rather, it is a psychological question _
what we are really asking is how much better off the drug makes
people feel. But isn't that true of economic progress in general?
And once you put it that way, you have to wonder whether we are
really making that much progress after all.
 &HT;    Consider: According to the official statistics, the median
family in 1947 had almost exactly the same purchasing power as the
20th-percentile family _ just a little ways above the poverty line
_ of 1996. And the statistics surely understate the true increase
in purchasing power.
 &HT;    Does that mean that most people in 1947 were poor? Well, they
didn't feel poor. Conversely, the 60th percentile in 1996
officially had about the same real income as the 95th percentile in
1947, and again this surely understates the real progress.
 &HT;    Does this mean that most Americans are now upper-middle class?
They don't feel that way.
 &HT;    In other words, as soon as you try to think seriously about how
to measure Viagra's effect on the nation's wealth, you realize what
a dubious enterprise such comparisons are. I have nothing against
calculating real GDP as accurately as possible; we need that number
for all kinds of purposes.
 &HT;    But the rather vulgar case of Viagra reminds us that, in the
end, economics is not about wealth _ it's about the pursuit of
happiness.

POWERBOOK G3 DOES ITS JOB 
</HEADLINE>
  By STEPHEN C. MILLER 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Apple's For weeks, readers have bombarded me with e-mail about
how wonderful the Apple Macintosh PowerBook G3 laptop is, how it
blows the socks off comparable Windows machines and will solve all
of my travel-related computing problems. So I gave it a try.
</P>
<P>
   I tested an entry-level PowerBook G3 which featured a
233-megahertz processor with 32 megabytes of RAM, 2 megabytes of
video RAM, a 2-gigabyte hard drive, a 20X CD-ROM drive, a floppy
drive (which costs extra), an Ethernet port and a 12.1-inch
dual-scan screen. The whole package costs just over $2,000 -- a
great price that's comparable to Windows laptops. That has always
been a major complaint: Macs cost too much.
</P>
<P>
   The G3 is one of the best-looking laptops on the market. Its
sleek black case with the white Apple logo stands out in a crowd. I
liked the keyboard's good tactile feedback because I tend to be
heavy-handed when typing. I really pound on the keyboard -- when I
push a key, I want it to push back.
</P>
<P>
   I have always liked how the designers of the PowerBook moved the
keyboard close to the screen, creating space for a wrist rest. This
helps keep your wrist from drooping, which can hasten problems with
repetitive strain injury. The wrist rest on the G3 is even bigger
than those on earlier PowerBooks, providing even more support.
</P>
<P>
   The screen was a disappointment. Its 800-by-600-pixel resolution
wasn't as sharp as some of the dual-scan displays that I've seen on
Windows laptops. The two higher-end G3 models come with sharper
active-matrix screens -- 13.3 and 14.1 inches. While I love the
larger screens, I think that they are a hindrance if you try to
work on airplanes. If the person in front of you leans back in
their seat, you can't open the display fully.
</P>
<P>
   Even the 12-inch screen is surrounded by an inch of stylish
bezel, increasing the overall dimensions of the unit to 10.4 inches
by 12.7 inches by 2 inches. Compare this to my current laptop, a
Dell Latitude: 8.5 by 11 by 2. The G3 did not fit into three of my
laptop bags and barely squeezed into my Port bag. However, Port is
the exclusive maker of carrying cases for the G3 laptops, so you
can get a case that fits even the 14-inch model nicely. It retails
for $129.
</P>
<P>
   The larger screens also add weight, which is a problem with the
G3 PowerBooks. The lightest model weighs in at 7.3 pounds, over my
7-pound limit for laptops. But I can usually live with the weight,
all else being equal.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, things aren't equal. We're talking Apples and,
well, other stuff. Unless you need some software that is only
available for Windows, there is no reason to switch to a Windows
machine. As for people who are already Macintosh devotees, why
should they care if, as the ads claim, the G3 is faster than a
Pentium? They should be more concerned with how much faster or
better the G3 runs programs than earlier Mac laptops.
</P>
<P>
   For a Mac person, the usual decision is not whether to switch to
a Windows laptop, but whether you can afford a new Mac. The low
price of the G3 makes that a moot point.If you want a Mac because
you adore them, which is how most of the Mac fanatics feel, buy a
new Mac and keep Apple solvent. If most of the software you need is
only available for Windows, then buy a Windows machine.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a probably apocryphal story. Back in the 1920s, when oil
was first discovered in the Mideast, some oil company executives
were trying to secure drilling rights from a Bedouin chief. They
took the chief and his English-speaking grandson for an airplane
ride. During the flight, the old man sat quietly, barely glancing
out the window as the plane circled over the desert.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the ground, the confused executives asked the grandson,
``Has your grandfather been on a plane before?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said, ``before today, he didn't know such a thing
existed.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the baffled executives said, ``He didn't seem very
impressed being in a machine that flew in the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   After a brief exchange with the chief, the grandson replied,
``Why should he be impressed? Isn't that what it's supposed to
do?''
</P>
<P>
   And that is how I feel about the PowerBook G3. It's a Mac. It
looks like a Mac, it comes with the Mac operating system, and it
runs Mac software really well. Depending on how you configure it,
the G3 can match or surpass the performance of some desktop Macs
and do lots of neat Mac things.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that what it's supposed to do?

ARTS(AT)LARGE 
 ART CONFERENCE REVOLUTIONARIES 
</HEADLINE>
  By MATTHEW MIRAPAUL 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The organizers of the International Symposium on Electronic Art
say they want a revolution, but they may have to settle for
providing power to the people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Revolution'' is the central concept of this year's conference,
which began after an opening reception and a concert by the
found-sound musician Scanner on Sept. 2. But at a time when
electronic art is struggling to penetrate the fortress of the
cultural establishment, the theme may represent wishful thinking
more than reality.
</P>
<P>
   About 700 artists and academics, plus the occasional capitalist
tool, were expected to attend the ninth ISEA, where they will hear
dozens of lectures on topics such as ``Computer-Generated
Photography and the Neoclassical Sensibility,'' ``Why Bring the
Virtual World Onto the Classical Stage?'' and ``Things That Go
Ping.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Charles Dickens novel that was set in a different
revolutionary period, this ISEA is a tale of two cities. The
Liverpool symposium concluded Sept. 4, and the conference continued
on Sept. 6 in nearby Manchester with a two-day exploration of the
related theme of ``Terror.''
</P>
<P>
   Both cities have seen their share of innovation. Manchester
spawned the Industrial Revolution and also lays claim to being the
birthplace of the ``Baby,'' the first electronic computer with a
stored program, which turned 50 earlier this year. Liverpool's fame
involves a certain rock quartet that sang ``Baby's in Black'' and a
few other memorable numbers (ISEA's keynote speeches will be
delivered in the Paul McCartney Auditorium at the Liverpool
Institute for Performing Arts).
</P>
<P>
   Colin Fallows, director of the Liverpool portion of the
symposium, explained that the ``revolution'' theme was selected for
its rich multiple meanings and as a metaphor for change, but he
demurred when asked if the term could be applied to the current
state of the digital arts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that issue will be discussed and that people will stand
up and nail their flag to the mast, as it were,'' said Fallows, a
member of the arts faculty at Liverpool John Moores University, one
of the conference hosts. ``It's one of the reasons for going with
the theme of revolution; it's a kind of challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Berg, director of Liverpool's Foundation for Art &AMP;
Creative Technology, or FACT, which curated the ISEA '98 art
exhibits in both cities, was equally cautious in assessing the
tenor of the times.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a revolution happening, it's a much less visible
and celebrated revolution'' than the social revolutions of the
60's, Berg said. ``I think we're living through a period of
self-doubt and questioning and uncertainty, which is reflected by
artists as well. People say this is pre-millennial tension, but
it's been there for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the militant themes and bold rhetoric -- one
Liverpool meeting space has been temporarily dubbed ``The Art
Mainstream as the Enemy Room,'' and an online note for the sessions
at Manchester Metropolitan University declares that the
presentations ``will explode like bombs'' -- could be viewed as an
attempt to reenergize a stalled genre.
</P>
<P>
   The effort is necessary because, as was the case at last year's
conference in Chicago, the level of discourse about electronic art
at ISEA '98 may prove in many instances to be higher than the
quality of the art itself -- an assessment with which Berg
concurred.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, most of the noteworthy works in the conference's
exhibits cannot be experienced on the Web. While there are 19
Web-based artworks on the FACT site and another 40 entered in a
net-art98 competition, many are already familiar to the digital art
community, including Juliet Ann Martin's ``My Computer Never Thinks
of Me,'' Ken Goldberg's ``Shadow Server'' and Olia Lialina's ``My
Boyfriend Came Back from the War.''
</P>
<P>
   But those attending ISEA '98 will encounter about 50 projects,
half being shown for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``First and foremost, we're interested in the 'art' bit of
electronic art,'' Berg said. ``My personal impression of last year
was that there was a very strong emphasis on the electronics bit.
This is not going to look like a trade show with 300 computers in
one room; it's going to look like an art show.''
</P>
<P>
   So, for example, the always-playful Perry Hoberman will unveil
``System Update,'' a witty look at interactivity that lets
participants control a computer and then forces them to conform to
its output. Keith Piper will demonstrate ``Robot Bodies,'' his
response to the way science fiction rarely represents blacks among
its android creations.
</P>
<P>
   Fallows, a sound artist, asked 68 of his international
colleagues to submit one-minute sound pieces on a third theme:
hope. ``Where there's revolution and terror, there's also hope,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Site-specific installations include the sound artist Nigel
Helyer's ``From Ship to Shore,'' a yellow buoy floating in the
water at Liverpool's Albert Dock attraction that broadcasts the
voices of Liverpudlians, and the AudioRom group's ``Sound Track,''
which allows travelers passing through the Manchester and Liverpool
train stations to assemble a composition from sounds collected
during the 45-minute ride between the two cities.
</P>
<P>
   Berg said showing works that would appeal to local residents was
a deliberate decision. ``The [exhibition] program is not a program
for delegates, it's a program for everyone,'' he said. ``We're
trying to get real audiences rather than the 700 people who come to
the conference and then go away again in four or five days.''
</P>
<P>
   This spirit of inclusion is laudable, especially when so much of
the symposium content will be couched in the language of dense
academic analysis.

VERMONT COLLEGE TRIES GRADUATE INTERNET PROGRAMS 
</HEADLINE>
  By PAMELA MENDELS 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Later this month, 64 adults eager to learn how to use the
Internet in business or in the classroom are expected to begin an
unusual graduate degree program offered by Marlboro College in
Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   If they stick with the course, an intense yearlong mixture of
online and face-to-face instruction, they will earn a masters
degree either in the science of Internet strategy management or the
art of teaching with Internet technologies.
</P>
<P>
   By paying $15,000 per person to participate, they also will have
contributed to the financial well-being of a small private
undergraduate college that, like many others, has sweated to
balance its budget in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Marlboro officials are keeping their fingers crossed that the
institution's first venture into graduate education will prove a
money-maker that could cut the college's annual operating deficit
in half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marlboro is a traditional liberal arts school, struggling
financially,'' said Paul J. LeBlanc, president of the college and
the founder of its new Graduate Center. ``It is branching out in
this new, interesting but very different way and strengthening
itself financially as a result of those efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Marlboro, many small private schools are facing financial
headaches, and are experimenting with ventures like graduate
programs in physical therapy or business management to help
generate revenue. Where Marlboro is taking an unusual turn, said
Ann J. Duffield, associate director of the Institute for Higher
Education at the University of Pennsylvania, is its focus on the
Internet as a body of study.
</P>
<P>
   ``Courses about the Internet are rather unusual as formal degree
offerings from colleges or universities,'' she said, adding ``I
think it's rather exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Marlboro's undergraduate program, with about 260 students, is
based in a cozy cluster of white, farm-like buildings off a winding
rural road about 10 miles outside of Brattleboro. The Graduate
Center, in contrast, is located in town in the computer-filled
suites of a nondescript office building.
</P>
<P>
   The separation was intentional, said LeBlanc, a former English
professor who fell in love with technology as a graduate student
and had a programming language accepted to help fulfill his foreign
language requirement.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he wanted the Graduate Center to be as easily
accessible to students who commuted to school as possible. For
another, he wanted the program to forge its own identity.
</P>
<P>
   The Graduate Center, which opened with its ``pioneer class''
last January, is aimed at working adults who want to be able to
advise their companies on how to use the Internet in business, or
to work with technology proficiently in an educational setting.
</P>
<P>
   The course of study is practical. In the Internet strategy
management program, for example, students are required to take
courses about such things as network design, online privacy and
Internet marketing. In the teaching with Internet technologies
program, they learn about network operation in academic settings
and the design of online educational materials.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the coursework takes place via the Internet, but every
other week, students assemble at the Graduate Center for nine hours
of live instruction. As much as he believes in online education,
LeBlanc says that there are some things that are best taught in
person. ``I wanted that energy and spark that comes from having
people together in the same room from each other and their
professors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One the first students to enroll in the program is John M.
Mahoney, a 62-year-old writer, photographer and Web designer who
wanted to hone his Internet marketing skills. Living in Stanstead
Township in Quebec, Canada, just over the U.S. border, Mahoney
drives three hours every two weeks to attend class at the Graduate
Center. ``I've got every Interstate exit mapped in my head by
now,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   With what he pays for overnight lodgings, food and course
necessities like software, Mahoney estimates that the program will
have cost him about $20,000 by the time he earns the Internet
strategy management degree in December, after three semesters of
work.
</P>
<P>
   But the expense and time have been worth it, he said. ``I have
more synapses firing than I have in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the program is finding a market. After launching
with 25 students in January, an extra class was created to
accommodate 64 students this fall. And the school has already
received 50 applications for next year.
</P>
<P>
   This is good news for Marlboro's coffers. The college, with an
endowment of about $2 million, has a budget of about $7 million a
year and a deficit of about $1.2 million, which has been erased
annually in recent years through appeals to donors. By the end of
this academic year, the Graduate Center will have helped chisel
away at that figure by clearing about $300,000. Eventually, LeBlanc
said, the Center should cover about half of the school's annual
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   However, some experts warn of potential pitfalls with the new
revenue-generating initiatives that colleges are pursuing. ``The
danger is that you stray so far from your educational purpose that
you lose your soul,'' said Richard A. Detweiler, president of
Hartwick College in Oneonta, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   But LeBlanc is convinced that this will not be the case with the
Graduate Center. He believes that a liberal arts institution is the
best place for Internet instruction, because it can bring a more
humane perspective to technology.
</P>
<P>
   LeBlanc, who took a leave of absence from academia in 1993 to
create and direct an education technology business unit for the
Houghton Mifflin Company, said that although studying the Internet
can be a highly technical endeavor, it also requires examination of
knowledge itself -- how it is created, stored and shared in
society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Liberal arts, I would argue, is about questions of
knowledge,'' LeBlanc said. ``'How is knowledge made?' 'How do we
come to know?' I don't want to leave those important questions to a
merely technical program.''

LAWSUIT TESTS STUDENT SPEECH ON THE WEB  
</HEADLINE>
  By CARL S. KAPLAN 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can a student's personal Web site, which can be accessed through
school computers, be considered ``on campus?'' And can vulgar
insults about administrators and teachers on that site disrupt
classes?
</P>
<P>
   Those are just some of the novel legal questions posed by a
recent case in southeastern Missouri, where a high school
principal's right to discipline a student for the contents of his
personal Web site have been challenged by a local affiliate of the
American Civil Liberties Union as a violation of the First
Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The case, which pits Brandon Beussink, 17, of Marble Hill, Mo.,
against his school district, is the latest in a handful of
incidents involving the free-speech rights of students on personal
Web pages, say legal experts.
</P>
<P>
   So far, none of the cases has resulted in a legal precedent that
would set guidelines for this new area of student speech, although
a few cases have been settled on terms favorable to students. The
Missouri case, filed in federal district court in St. Louis, may
yield a court decision, however, as both sides appear to be eager
for a legal fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is the student used the Internet as a tool to
criticize his school, and he has every right to do so,'' said
Deborah Jacobs, executive director of the ACLU of Eastern Missouri,
which filed suit on behalf of Beussink.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth C. McManaman, a lawyer for the Woodland R-IV School
District, where Beussink attends Woodland High School, said his
side is not interested in settling. ``The school board is real
comfortable with what they did,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Legal papers filed in the case say that in late 1997 or early
1998, Beussink, then a junior, used a home computer to set up a
personal Web page after school hours, through an Internet account
paid for by his parents.
</P>
<P>
   The site contained, among other things, profane insults directed
toward his school and its faculty and administration, according to
the ACLU's Jacobs. In addition, the site discussed in less volatile
language Beussink's views on problems with the school: ''[T]he
students are treated like they are lower than dirt, and are
constantly reminded of this.'' The page also included a link to the
official Woodland High School home page.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the school's principal, Yancy Poorman, told
Beussink that he would be suspended from school for 10 days as a
punishment for creating and posting his site, according to court
papers. In a formal disciplinary notice, Poorman said that
Beussink, among other things, maintained a home page with
``profanity, inappropriate comments and slanderous remarks,'' and
that the incident was Beussink's third abuse of computers,
according to the filings.
</P>
<P>
   After Beussink removed the offending site and completed his
punishment, the school informed him that his absences from class
exceeded the allowable limit. He thus failed all of his classes for
the second semester, and he may be forced to graduate late.
</P>
<P>
   In his suit, filed on August 28, Beussink asked the court to
award him unspecified monetary damages, payment of his legal fees
and the reinstatement of his lost academic credits. The school
district has 60 days to respond to the complaint. A hearing in the
fall is likely.
</P>
<P>
   Poorman, the high school principal, declined to comment on the
case, as did Beussink. Calls to the district superintendent were
not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Underwood, general counsel for the National School Boards
Association in Alexandria, Va., said the U.S. Supreme Court has
decided in a series of cases that a school may exercise three
levels of control over student speech.
</P>
<P>
   At the highest level, a school may impose control on student
newspapers and other school-sponsored curriculum-related activities
in response to various misdeeds, including a lack of fairness or an
invasion of privacy, she said. Second, a school may also control
lewd and profane student speech ``within school,'' such as at an
assembly. Finally, a school may regulate the on-campus or
off-campus speech of a student if the speech risks causing a
``material and substantial'' disruption of classroom activities,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, McManaman, the lawyer for the Woodland
school district, indicated that Beussink was properly disciplined
because the Web site contained profane speech and was aimed at an
audience of students and teachers -- thus within the legal
precedents allowing a school to restrict profane language.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new kind of area we're talking about --
cyberspace,'' McManaman said. He said a strong link between
Beussink's Web site and the school was forged because the student
learned how to use the Internet at school, he signed an Internet
agreement at school pledging to use the Net responsibly, he linked
to the official school site and he created the site with the aim of
communicating with students and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A school has an educational mission and obligation to teach
values,'' McManaman said. ``There wouldn't be a suspension here if
[Beussink] didn't use inappropriate language,'' he said, adding
that Beussink also had a record of past computer misuse.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the profanity did not give the school enough basis to
discipline Beussink, McManaman said, the site would still warrant a
reprimand because it was off-campus speech that clearly disrupted
the school. For example, the site was read by students in the
school's computer classes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Underwood of the National School Boards Association agreed that
under certain circumstances, a student's personal Web page may be
considered ``within school'' or even related to a school's
curricular functions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question, really, in this case is whether the speech is
pervasively vulgar and 'within school,''' she said.
``Theoretically, a personal Web site could be 'within school,'''
depending on how many links there are to school sites and other
factors, she added. Underwood said she didn't know enough of the
facts of the Beussink case to reach a conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Other lawyers pounced on McManaman's notion, however.
</P>
<P>
   For McManaman to say the Internet is so pervasive that a
student's personal Web site is somehow connected to a school is
``just crazy,'' said Ann Beeson, a lawyer with the ACLU. ``That is
completely unsupported by the nature of the Net. You have to find
speech on the Net. You have to look for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert M. O'Neil, director of the Thomas Jefferson Center for
the Protection of Free Expression and a professor at the University
of Virginia's law school, said, ``It's an interesting theory, but
it seems to me it doesn't really apply in this setting ...
[because] all the student's activity clearly occurred off campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that a Web site can be accessed on campus in a
computer class is not much different from a student bringing a copy
of a leaflet to school and passing it around,'' O'Neil said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neil added that he didn't think Beussink's Web site was
sufficiently disruptive to enable the school to discipline the
student for off-campus speech. ``If all the Web page did was
contain an embarrassing link and cast embarrassment or disapproval
on the school,'' then the school's attempt to control the student's
speech was not legitimate, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Houston, executive director of the American Association of
School Administrators, a trade group based in Arlington, Va., said
he believed the Woodland school district will lose the case, given
the deference the courts have shown to student speech. But he said
he could understand the motivations of the Woodland school
principal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents expect the schools to create an atmosphere of civil
speech, and by not acting to combat profanity, a school may be seen
to condone it,'' he said. ``When a school does act, it can run into
[legal] problems. It's an interesting dilemma for schools.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, profane student speech is not new. ``Kids
have been saying bad things about teachers since schools were
invented,'' Houston said.

 MARK McGWIRE'S FAME IS IN THE CARDS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JO-ANN JOHNSTON  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ And now for some really important economic
baseball statistics: Mark McGwire just caught the Glory Bear.
</P>
<P>
   Sports memorabilia collectors all over are taking notice. With
his 62nd home run Tuesday night, the St. Louis Cardinals first
baseman popped the value of several baseball trading cards that
feature him. Mint-condition cards showing McGwire in his 1984 U.S.
Olympic Team uniform are selling for $200.
</P>
<P>
   ``In April, we were paying $15,'' said Tony LePage, owner of
Affordable Sportscards, Comics and Collectables in Cohoes, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   That puts McGwire's Olympic cards (published in 1985 by Topps)
in the same price league with Glory Bear, a special edition Beanie
Baby created for an estimated 51,000 fans attending the 69th Annual
All-Star Game in July in Denver. The little white bear with red and
blue stars all over and an American flag on its chest is now
fetching $200 on the QVC television shopping channel, LePage said.
</P>
<P>
   Collectors and dealers say they are looking all over for McGwire
cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had 100 McGwire (Olympic) cards, I could sell them
today,'' said Mickey Russell, interviewed Wednesday from his shop,
Mickey &AMP; Ruth's Sports Cards in Defreestville, N.Y. Russell sold
about 30 in the past couple of weeks and depleted his supply. Now,
he can't get more.
</P>
<P>
   Vintage has a lot to do with a card's value. The Olympic card is
fetching the highest price _ and has escalated most steeply in
value in recent months _ because it is the first one from his
career, dealers said. In fact, people are mistaking McGwire's
Olympic card for his true ``rookie card,'' which was issued in 1987
at the start of his Major League Baseball career with the Oakland
A's, Russell said. The 1987 card was selling for $15 last week.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for other McGwire cards from less dramatic years isn't
apt to be as strong. For instance, the price listing of Beckett
Baseball Monthly's says a mint-condition 1989 Topps Card featuring
with McGwire is worth $1, though the price is apt to rise. (The
price guide was compiled last week, just before the monthly went to
press. It hit newsstands Tuesday.) But some collectors do want to
get recent cards of the batter showing him in his St. Louis
Cardinals uniform to be in sync with the batter's milestone 62nd
homer, Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   So the current Beckett Baseball Card said that a 1998 Pinnacle
Performer ``Big Bang'' card of McGwire will fetch $50 or more if
it's in mint condition.
</P>
<P>
   The prices of highly desirable cards will stay high through the
end of baseball season, dealers predicted.
</P>
<P>
   The bull market in McGwire cards is not extending to baseball
cards generally, dealers said. But they hope that the excitement
surrounding the St. Louis slugger will get others into the game.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    In the course of what Hollywood types refer to as
``development,'' a screenplay's journey from first draft to
production will frequently take it through the hands of several
writers.
 &HT;    Not long ago, I told my lawyer that the latest draft of an
action-comedy a friend and I are writing for Columbia Pictures was
nearly finished, and he replied, ``Good, you'll hand it in just in
time to be replaced.''
 &HT;    He was joking, but he also was not _ ``Small Soldiers,'' for
instance, originally written by Gavin Scott, was purchased by
Steven Spielberg in 1992, and successively revised by Anne
Spielberg, Danny Rubin, Frank Deese and Lewis Colick, before a
version by Adam Rifkin, incorporating Spielberg's suggestion that
the titular soldiers be divided into two warring factions, was
green-lighted for production last year.
 &HT;    But in a world (to borrow the phrase favored by stentorian
coming-attractions narrators) dominated by giant summer action
movies, the development process hardly stops once a movie is deemed
actually ready to shoot. These days, that's often when it picks up
speed.
 &HT;    More and more commonly, screenwriters who labor to get a movie
green-lighted merely stand at the head of a conveyor belt designed
by producers and studios to precision-tool hits, sending their
scripts along for subsequent handling by a small army of additional
writers, each one specifically directed to beef up action scenes,
to polish dialogue, to throw in some romance or ladle zingers over
the proceedings.
 &HT;    Within the industry, it's an open secret that the authors of
elevated fare such as ``Chinatown,'' ``Schindler's List,''
``Silence of the Lambs'' and ``Apollo 13'' are regularly called in
to make anonymous contributions to popcorn movies such as ``Con
Air,'' ``Twister,'' ``Eraser'' and ``Mission: Impossible.'' As
Robin Swicord, who is known for her adaptions of literary material
such as ``Little Women,'' puts it: ``What's the old saying? `A
camel is an animal built by committee.' Well, these movies are like
camels.''
 &HT;    While ``The Avengers,'' just released, benefits from the
uncredited writing contributions of Nicholas Meyer, this summer's
most extreme example would be the asteroid disaster thriller
``Armageddon,'' which employed eight writers on various parts of
its scenario. After Jonathan Hensleigh conceived a story he
described as ```The Dirty Dozen' goes to outer space,'' sold the
pitch to Disney and delivered to the producer Jerry Bruckheimer a
script that mapped out the film's essential structure, he
eventually left to work on another project, which was to be his
directorial debut.
 &HT;    No doubt it seems paradoxical that big, dumb movies would
require the massed efforts of Hollywood's finest minds in a way
that more sophisticated films often do not, but the challenge of
designing something with the requisite thrills, chills and spills
to appeal to a broad international audience is easily obscured by
the simplicity of the plots involved.
 &HT;    Jonathan Glickman, president of production at Caravan Pictures,
says there are about 40 writers who are regularly relied upon to
come in and work on films that are already set to shoot. Recurring
among this summer's releases, for instance, are Hensleigh; the team
of Terry Rossio and Ted Elliott, credited on ``The Mask of Zorro,''
``Small Soldiers'' and ``Godzilla''; Zak Penn, who followed Rossio
and Elliott on ``Soldiers'' and ``Zorro,'' and Scott Frank, who
adapted ``Out of Sight'' and then did uncredited work on ``Saving
Private Ryan.''
 &HT;    In many ways, the approach harks back to the Golden Age of
Hollywood, when studios were literally factories, operating on
assembly-line principles to produce 50 movies a year. In the '30s
and '40s, writers were more explicitly and more narrowly
specialized. Some worked only on structure, making scene outlines
from story material in plays or books or magazines. Others, often
playwrights and journalists imported from New York, excelled at
dialogue. Still others functioned as gag men, responsible for jokes
and bits of comic business.
 &HT;    That so many of the films made during that time turned out so
well was less a matter of personal artistry, argued the French film
critic Andri Bazin, than ``the genius of the system.'' Consciously
modeling his own divvying up of scripts on this method, Bruckheimer
says, ``I'm a big fan of the genius of the system.''
 -0- 
 &HT;    As a way of illustrating the process a little more completely,
meet Tim D.(1), one of those hot young screenwriters you hear about
every so often who has yet to see any of his scripts produced.
While working on an effects-driven fantasy called ``Francis Ford
Coppola's Sigmund Freud's The Interpretation of Dreams,'' which
Dreamworks is developing for the famous director, Tim comes up with
a new idea: What if, in a preapocalyptic near-future with the
country riven by internal conflict, armed terrorists, in an attempt
to chip away at national morale, started hijacking entire baseball
teams, holding them hostage and forcing them to miss their games?
 &HT;    Suppose on a July 4 weekend, they kidnapped the New York
Yankees, threatening their traditional Independence Day contest
against the Red Sox? What if the Pentagon recruited an elite squad
of smooth-fielding, power-hitting anti-terrorists whose job it was
to play in the absent team's stead while also hunting down the bad
guys and rescuing the hostage ballplayers?
 &HT;    Baseball Commandos! Imagine the opening scene, when after the
Red Sox players are introduced and run onto the field, a jet plane
streaks overhead, and 15 men parachute down into the stadium, the
announcer's voice introducing them, one by one. America's team: the
Baseball Commandos!
 &HT;    Tim runs the idea by his agent, summarizing it as ```The Dirty
Dozen' on a ball field.'' His agent responds enthusiastically to
the pitch, sure that he can sell it, though he points out that
baseball teams really only have nine players. ``OK,'' Tim says,
``it's `Die Hard' in New York City.''
 &HT;    The agent reminds him that ``Die Hard With a Vengeance'' had
already been ``Die Hard'' in New York City. ``Your players, the
Commandos,'' he says, ``they should be underdogs, right? Sure, they
can defuse a bomb, but can they hit the sinking curve? It's `The
Mighty Ducks' with guns.'' This potent catch phrase, ```The Mighty
Ducks' with guns,'' along with a panoramic description of the
team's entrance, puts ``Baseball Commandos'' over.
 &HT;    It is a clear-cut summer movie, a slam-bang actionfest, with
roles for several stars. Every studio in town bids on the project,
and when the dust settles, Tim is hired to turn his idea into a
screenplay.
 &HT;    While Tim is off writing his first draft, the studio sends a
story outline of ``Baseball Commandos'' to several major stars.
Bruce Willis commits to the role of Boog Parker, the Commandos'
first baseman, hostage negotiator and team leader. Will Smith
agrees to play Freedom ``da Bomb'' Washington, a hot-shot
outfielder and demolitions expert. Kurt Russell, who played
minor-league ball in real life, also expresses interest in being on
the team.
 &HT;    In short, decisions that will affect the film's final shape
start being made before anybody has even seen a script. Indeed,
Tim's first draft is full of potential, but incomplete. It is too
schematic, simply alternating from the drama of the baseball game
between the Commandos and the Red Sox to the battle between the
evil terrorists and the Commandos. There is something flat and
video-game-ish about it.
 &HT;    This is always the crucial point, where the studio considers
pulling the plug, but there are other considerations, including the
actors' commitments _ how can you not make a movie with Willis and
Smith? _ and deals for promotional tie-ins. Ultimately, the
decision is made to crash the project through.
 &HT;    The studio calls in Jonathan Hensleigh (2) to address the
overall structure of the script. Beefing up the suspense and
dramatic logic of the story, Hensleigh disguises the Commandos as
the Yankees' Newark farm club, flown in to substitute.
 &HT;    To make Spartan Sizemore, the terrorist leader, a more
compelling villain, Hensleigh has the group now not only hold the
Yankees hostage, but also wire the stadium to blow. Overall, he
punctuates the film with a steady rhythm of escalating action
sequences.
 &HT;    When he is finished, casting continues: to appeal to women, Lucy
Lawless, Linda Hamilton and Roseanne are cast as Commandos, a move
that will necessitate the rewriting of their parts. Callie Khouri
(3) is brought in for the job, contributing, among other things, a
memorable line spoken by Roseanne's character, catcher Ruth
``Babe'' Orsini: ``You gotta wonder about ballplayers who run
around calling themselves Pee Wee.''
 &HT;    Separately, Michael Tolkin (4) and Steven Zaillian (5) are hired
to work on the human element, deepening the story lines of several
of the fans in attendance at the game: a pair of Boston teen-agers
who ride the bus to New York City for the first time; a Puerto
Rican from East Harlem and his girlfriend, and a Bronx homegirl who
takes her brother's ticket after he is shot by a man who turns out
to be one of the terrorists and who ultimately helps Will Smith
find the detonator beneath the stadium.
 &HT;    Ron Shelton (6), who doesn't usually do rewrite work, is
prevailed upon to take over the baseball scenes, adding the part of
an autistic relief pitcher _ for Pearl Jam's lead singer, Eddie
Vedder, in his first major film role. (He also agrees to write and
perform for the soundtrack.) For a motivational speech that Willis
delivers during the seventh-inning stretch, Shelton cribs from the
writings of A. Bartlett Giamatti, comparing baseball to Renaissance
poetry.
 &HT;    However, his metaphorical master stroke is a gambit that Willis'
character will deploy, called ``throwing the screwball,'' in which,
by means of calculated double talk and nonsense, he consistently
confuses and disarms the terrorists.
 &HT;    When the Japanese superstar ``Beat'' Takeshi Kitano is cast _
ratcheting up both the hipness quotient and the appeal to Asian
audiences _ Quentin Tarantino (7) is hired to write his character.
It is his idea that first Smith, and then ultimately the whole
team, refer to Kitano as Astro Boy, in homage to the famous
Japanese TV cartoon.
 &HT;    Tarantino models Kitano's character on the fabled Tokyo Giants
home-run king, Sadaharu Oh, who refined his batting technique by
studying traditional Aikido and sword-fighting skills, which come
in handy during a skirmish with Sizemore's terrorists on the D
train between the third and fourth innings.
 &HT;    As shooting is about to start, Zak Penn (8) and Carrie Fisher
(9) are brought in to address the humor of the story, a job made
easier by the casting of Steve Buscemi as the Commandos'
smart-aleck batboy, Bill Murray as an addled play-by-play announcer
and Garry Shandling as the vain, craven Yankees owner.
 &HT;    Finally, Sean Connery, who has agreed to play the terrorist
Sizemore, requests a writer to polish his dialogue. Frank Darabont
(10) is brought in for the job.
 &HT;    Unhappy at being shunted aside so quickly, Tim leaves ``Baseball
Commandos'' to write a new script, a clever twist on an old idea
called ``Viet Kong,'' concerning a giant ape discovered in the
jungles of Southeast Asia and trained to fight U.S. and South
Vietnamese troops. Warner Brothers buys it for Oliver Stone to
direct, and Tim's off on the rewrite treadmill once again.
 -0- 
 &HT;    Producers and studio executives tend to justify this approach in
terms of insurance: They're spending $100 million, and want to know
that every moment, every gesture, every line is as good as it can
be. A script is never perfect. It's never right enough, it's never
funny enough, there's not enough suspense. So producers want to be
able to call on writers who can do those things.
 &HT;    Says Glickman: ``Everyone wants a guy who's done it before. You
have to understand, it extends beyond writers _ you want a director
who's already made a big movie, a cinematographer, an editor. The
stakes are so high.''
 &HT;    Members of the elite and publicly invisible class of writers
created by the system can earn as much as $200,000 a week for their
contributions. Yet many writers, despite the lucrative inducements
to rewrite others, are increasingly unhappy with the seeming
disposability of their own work and have begun more vocally to
decry the practice.
 &HT;    But to the blockbuster way of thinking, a script is far less a
literary or an imaginative undertaking than it is a business plan
for a start-up company that requires some $70 million to $100
million in initial capitalization. In essence, studios are
investment banks that specialize in financing this kind of venture.
Their executives are experts in evaluating such plans in terms of
particular elements that are thought to guarantee a good return.
When these elements are deemed to be in place, then the business is
financed and the movie is made.
 &HT;    A cynical person might conclude that the scripts for movies like
``Baseball Commandos'' are fairly irrelevant _ a point of view
supported by Steven Spielberg's court testimony regarding the
genesis of ``Twister,'' in which he stated that its screenplay was
responsible for only about 5 percent of the film's success relative
to special effects, star power, advertising and marketing.
 &HT;    But no one who is about to spend the equivalent of the GNP of
Tonga ever sets out to make a bad movie. Even under ideal
circumstances, as David Koepp, whose blockbuster experience
includes both ``Jurassic Park'' movies and ``Mission: Impossible''
as well as this summer's ``Snake Eyes,'' has pointed out, the more
fantastic the premise of a film, and the more effects technology it
necessitates, ``it's difficult to have any kind of human drama that
doesn't seem incompatible.''
 &HT;    Says Daniel Waters, whose quirky sensibility has informed movies
like ``Hudson Hawk'' and ``Demolition Man'': ``People who've
written a big-budget screenplay never blame the script. People who
haven't always do. I remember coming out of the first `Batman'
movie and saying: `Oh, my God, they had such amazing visuals! If
only there had been a decent script!' Then, three years later,
after I'd done heartbreaking work writing `Batman Returns,' I was
walking out of the premiere, when I overheard someone saying: `Man,
what a great-looking movie. If only they had a good script. ...'''

for a start-up company that requires some $70 million to $100
million in initial capitalization. In essence, studios are
investment banks that specialize in financing this kind of venture.
Their executives are experts in evaluating such plans in terms of
particular elements that are thought to guarantee a good return.
When these elements are deemed to be in place, then the business is
financed and the movie is made.
 &HT;    A cynical person might conclude that the scripts for movies like
``Baseball Commandos'' are fairly irrelevant _ a point of view
supported by Steven Spielberg's court testimony regarding the
genesis of ``Twister,'' in which he stated that its screenplay was
responsible for only about 5 percent of the film's success relative
to special effects, star power, advertising and marketing.
 &HT;    But no one who is about to spend the equivalent of the GNP of
Tonga ever sets out to make a bad movie. Even under ideal
circumstances, as David Koepp, whose blockbuster experience
includes both ``Jurassic Park'' movies and ``Mission: Impossible''
as well as this summer's ``Snake Eyes,'' has pointed out, the more
fantastic the premise of a film, and the more effects technology it
necessitates, ``it's difficult to have any kind of human drama that
doesn't seem incompatible.''
 &HT;    Says Daniel Waters, whose quirky sensibility has informed movies
like ``Hudson Hawk'' and ``Demolition Man'': ``People who've
written a big-budget screenplay never blame the script. People who
haven't always do. I remember coming out of the first `Batman'
movie and saying: `Oh, my God, they had such amazing visuals! If
only there had been a decent script!' Then, three years later,
after I'd done heartbreaking work writing `Batman Returns,' I was
walking out of the premiere, when I overheard someone saying: `Man,
what a great-looking movie. If only they had a good script. ...'''

 By MARK LILLA  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    August was the cruelest month. After the Tet offensive and the
escalation of the Vietnam War in early 1968, after the
assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy, and
then riots and looting in several major cities, Americans ended the
summer watching the Democratic Party implode at its Chicago
convention while policemen beat demonstrators on the streets
outside. The country seemed to be coming unglued.
 &HT;    Or was it the whole Western world? The situation in Europe
certainly made it seem so.
 &HT;    In the spring, universities in Madrid and Rome were closed after
clashes between students and police, while in West Germany the
leader of the largest student organization was shot, setting off
arson attacks by a newly formed terrorist group called the Red Army
Faction.
 &HT;    The following month, a student strike at a suburban university
outside Paris metamorphosed into the now famous ``events of May,''
which began with marches and the occupation of buildings and ended
with barricades, Molotov cocktails, hand-to-hand street combat and
a general strike that brought the French economy to its knees.
 &HT;    In the summer of `68 it seemed safe to assume that America and
Western Europe were undergoing the same ``revolution,'' a word that
came easily to the lips back then. But within a few years it became
obvious that very different dramas were being played out on the two
continents.
 &HT;    After a brief but significant flirtation with armed violence on
the fringes of the ```60s movement,'' the American left began to
turn its attention from strictly political issues, such as
segregation and imperialism, to new cultural ones, such as
feminism. As the war in Vietnam de-escalated, a cultural war that
is still with us began at home.
 &HT;    In Europe, however, it was the political repercussions of `68
that remained most significant over the next decade. French
students and intellectuals made a fetish of Chairman Mao and
genuflected before it, while German and Italian terrorists
kidnapped, ``kneecapped'' and murdered leading figures in business
and government.
 &HT;    The coldblooded execution of the former prime minister, Aldo
Moro, by the Italian Red Brigades on the 10th anniversary of May
`68 was only the most spectacular of these attacks, which lasted
into the 1980s.
 &HT;    Given these violent political contestations, you might expect
passions about the `60s to run higher in Europe today than in the
politically stable United States. Instead, the tumult has
disappeared: the `60s are over in Europe.
 &HT;    This past spring, the 30th anniversary of May `68 was calmly
commemorated across the continent without bloodshed _ indeed,
without significant controversy. Conferences were held, TV specials
were broadcast, day-by-day chronicles of the events appeared in the
newspapers and hundreds of books (more than 80 in France alone)
were printed.
 &HT;    Yet as the French newspaper Le Monde reported, the anniversary
was a publishing disaster. It appears there was neither enough
nostalgia for, nor rage against, the `60s revolution to induce the
French to read about it _ especially the young, for whom it is
ancient history.
 &HT;    This indifference is common today, though not because Europe has
returned to some pre-`68 slumber. It is simply that Europeans have
made their peace with the revolution's successes and failures.
Unlike the United States, where pro- and anti-`68 factions continue
to militate in the worlds of academia, journalism and politics,
Europe has comfortably entered a post-`68 age.
 &HT;    Which raises the question: Why haven't we? Why do the American
`60s, whose political conflicts no longer rage in our streets,
continue to rage in our heads?
 -0- 
 &HT;    What distinguishes the American and European `60s is less the
nature of the political and cultural changes that eventually took
place than the spirit in which they were pursued.
 &HT;    Was the revolution, as Europeans seemed to believe, essentially
about bringing an end to an old political order that also supported
a stifling bourgeois culture? Or was it, as Americans appeared to
think, about extending the reach of a noble if imperfectly realized
political ideal into every corner of cultural life?
 &HT;    The European `60s were politically contentious from the start,
for reasons that lie in a half-century of ideological polarization.
Until World War II, much of the continent looked not much different
from the Europe of the 19th century. It was rural, religious,
socially conservative and, especially in German-speaking
territories, admiring of military virtues. This was the traditional
home of the European right.
 &HT;    The European left, on the other hand, was centered in the
rapidly growing cities and divided between Communists and Social
Democrats. These forces polarized European politics in the decades
leading up to World War II, and most observers expected the
continent to fall back into this pattern at its conclusion.
 &HT;    Yet in the three decades following the war, a social
transformation began that would eventually turn over the tired soil
that had nourished hostile political relations in Europe for so
long. Its causes were fundamentally economic and military: 30 years
of unprecedented growth in production and public investment under
the American nuclear umbrella.
 &HT;    As the bounty arrived, the centuries-long divide between urban
and rural mentalities that underlay the right-left split began to
close up. Villages across Europe were depopulated and, through
television, people who remained behind began to take part, at least
from a distance, in the life of the capitals.
 &HT;    As working-class families acquired more consumer goods, the
distinctions between classes came to depend more on taste than on
buying power. This is not to say that postwar Europe became a
classless continent, simply that traditional social divisions were
being replaced by more complex ones _ the most significant new one
being generational.
 &HT;    At bottom, ``catching up'' was what the European `60s were all
about. Although Western Europe managed to get on the
liberal-democratic rails remarkably fast in the 20 years after the
war, its ideological frame of reference was still that of the
polarized prewar era.
 &HT;    The new Christian Democratic parties were, to be sure, nothing
like the old right, yet neither were they committed to the
modernization of social institutions. The Communists came out of
the war strengthened by their (often exaggerated) role in resisting
fascism, but their language of ``class struggle'' and ``leading
role of the party'' rang hollow.
 &HT;    While European workers continued to give their ballots to the
Communists, with their wallets they _ and especially their children
_ were voting for consumer capitalism. Out of this gap between the
reality of postwar European society and its prewar ideologies a new
political force was born.
 &HT;    Because it appealed to so many of the traditional symbols of the
European left _ and even radicalized them, replacing class struggle
with generational struggle, Marx and Lenin with Mao and Che,
``socialism in one country'' with worldwide peasant revolution _ it
stood to reason that it was taken to be a ``new'' left.
 &HT;    But, in fact, it was not essentially a revitalized left but a
third force that helped to extinguish an established European left
that could trace its lineage back to 1917 and even to 1789. Its new
demands for hedonistic fulfillment and individual self-expression
had nothing to do with Marxism, as the nervous Communist parties of
Europe understood perfectly well. And its skepticism toward the
experiences of real existing socialism was such that disenchantment
with the entire revolutionary tradition was bound to set in.
 &HT;    And it did. The first shock came in 1972 with the murder of 11
Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympic Games by the Palestinian
Black September group. Suddenly it seemed that the celebration of
terrorism and unconditional support of Third World struggles by the
most radical of the `68ers had, at least indirectly, sanctioned the
death of Jews again in Europe.
 &HT;    Then in 1974 Alexander Solzhenitsyn's ``Gulag Archipelago''
appeared, convincing many younger intellectuals on the left,
especially in France, of the necessary connection between communism
and totalitarian repression.
 &HT;    The fall of Saigon brought the heartbreaking flight of the boat
people; there was the Cambodian genocide, and in 1979 a ``people's
revolution'' in Iran brought to power a reactionary religious
clique that repressed secular intellectuals, women and homosexuals.
 &HT;    Because the European left took seriously the possibility of
communism and Third World revolution, in the end it was forced to
reckon with their historical records. And while this was happening,
the leftist dogma that real reform was impossible within ``formal''
democracy was proving to be a myth. Socialist parties came to power
in Portugal and France, then in Italy and Spain.
 &HT;    The German new left, which had been Europe's most intransigent,
progressively made its peace with parliamentary democracy. This
political ``normalization'' of the European left was accompanied by
an intellectual ``normalization,'' and by the mid-'80s the radical
newspapers founded in the wake of the `60s agitation _ Libiration
in Paris, La Repubblica in Rome, Die Tageszeitung in Berlin _ had
become perfectly conventional publications.
 &HT;    Thus, when perestroika began, and as the regimes of the East
Bloc started to crumble on the bicentennary of the French
Revolution, the European left had already divested itself of its
holdings in the enterprise that had been founded in Russia in 1917.
It was now clear to almost everyone that a 50-year tradition of
thinking and living politics had come to a close. And with it ended
the political dreams of `68.
 -0- 
 &HT;    This dramatic story of the European left's political maturation,
of revolutionary promise and betrayal, of illusions embraced and
lost, was not the story that unfolded in the United States. And the
reason for this is quite simple: the fate of the Communist idea,
and even of the French revolutionary tradition, had virtually no
significance for American `68ers. Politically speaking, they were,
and by and large still are, provincials.
 &HT;    While European radicals such as Rigis Debray spent the `60s in
the jungles of South America spreading the revolutionary gospel,
students in the United States stayed on campus and demanded that
America ``come home.'' Home was where its heart was, even when it
foolishly denounced ``Amerika.''
 &HT;    What these `68ers originally demanded was that America fulfill
its own democratic promise, not that it take up a new revolutionary
mission. The temple of the American democratic ideal had to be
cleansed. A ritual cleansing began with the civil-rights movement
and resistance to the war, and was finished once Richard Nixon
resigned and the troops came home.
 &HT;    Yet it was these very successes that fed the American left's
passion for greater purification, for an extension of the `68
spirit from the strictly political sphere to the whole of American
culture.
 &HT;    Aspects of American life that hitherto had been spared the
exacting scrutiny of pure democratic principles _ family, marriage,
the regulation of morals, the authority of law, even the authority
of learning _ now seemed somehow suspect, if not illegitimate. For
the `68ers, it was perfectly obvious that the struggle begun in the
streets of Selma and Chicago's Grant Park should be followed by new
campaigns in the classrooms and bedrooms of America.
 &HT;    The line between politics and culture looked absurd to them for
the simple reason that they did not take the democratic idea to be
a merely political principle. It was, so to speak, an existential
one that deserved to be applied to every aspect of our lives.
 &HT;    This existential character of the American democratic faith has
been noted by alert European observers of our country ever since
Tocqueville and Mrs. Trollope began writing about us in the 19th
century. They immediately notice two things: that democracy in
America is considered not just a set of institutions and principles
but a way of life and that it is promoted with a unique sort of
passion.
 &HT;    We Americans have trouble entertaining the notion that there
might be aspects of life _ let alone whole parts of the globe _
where it cannot or should not apply. To suggest this might be the
case is to risk being burned by the fire of democratic passion.
 &HT;    The American Founders had a strong sense of the passions to
which democratic politics is subject, which is why they placed such
a high value on moderating and canalizing them in the system of
government they fashioned. What they did not anticipate was that
the American conception of democracy would become an existential
one progressively chipping away at the distinction between politics
and culture that they took for granted.
 &HT;    Nor did they imagine that once democratic political passions
spilled over into the morally and psychologically fragile sphere of
culture, they would be more difficult to moderate and their damage
more difficult to repair.
 &HT;    It is little wonder that since the `60s we have become such a
``sensitive'' nation, in every sense of the term, for we have
extended the democratic project into extremely intimate areas of
life: sexual identity, marital relations, authority in the family
and moral education, not to mention the eternal complications of
race and ethnicity.
 &HT;    This conception of democracy as an all-encompassing way of life
is utterly foreign to European society, in large part because its
own past, like that of most human cultures, was aristocratic and
hierarchical. Europeans have therefore been somewhat anxious about
this trans-Atlantic difference, wondering whether America is
exceptional or merely more advanced in fashioning a democratic
culture destined to spread across the globe.
 &HT;    Whatever one's views on these speculations, the Europeans are
right to think that American democratic passions are still unique
in the world. Although democracy is becoming more widely recognized
abroad as a political value, there is still only one nation on
earth that takes it to be an existential one.
 &HT;    Which is not to say that European culture has not been
transformed since the `60s, in many ways following the American
democratic example. There has been something of a continental
cultural revolution, though it has been carried out much more
slowly than our own and without our red-hot passion.
 &HT;    The list of legal reforms stemming from the `60s is long and
familiar: the legalization of abortion, the near abolition of
censorship, guarantees of sexual equality in the workplace, the
decriminalization of homosexual activity, the parity of husbands
and wives before the law and the loosening of parents' statutory
authority over their children.
 &HT;    Informal changes in cultural mores also took place after `68, as
life became more relaxed and flexible in the workplace and the
home. And, not surprisingly, many of the dispiriting repercussions
of the `60s that we have experienced have also followed this
transformation in Europe, including increased divorce and
illegitimacy rates, the decline in public civility, drug problems
and violent youth crimes.
 &HT;    Yet after the shock of `68 and the flood of accumulated cultural
demands it unleashed, the institution of these reforms in Europe
met with general social consensus, mostly because of unspoken
agreement about the limits to cultural democratization.
 &HT;    European feminists have won many victories over recent decades
without taking on the joyless militancy of American feminism,
without questioning the naturalness of family or upsetting the
psychologically delicate ritual of seduction.
 &HT;    European schools that used to be strictly hierarchical and
indifferent to laggards have become more attentive to students'
needs. The curriculum, however, remains much as it was 30 years
ago, and there are no agonizing debates about making it
``representative.''
 &HT;    In short, cultural issues Americans instinctively frame in terms
of nonnegotiable democratic principles have been treated in Europe
through an informal balancing of those principles with other,
nonpolitical ones.
 &HT;    Indeed, because the modernization of post-`68 European culture
was not brought about through the sort of messianic moral crusade
that has been so divisive in America, in certain ways its reforms
have gone further than our own, and with fewer untoward effects.
 &HT;    As the `68 anniversary was marked in France this spring, there
were calm public debates about two measures that would be
unthinkable in the United States even today. One would require that
half of each political party's candidates for office be women; the
other would establish a legal framework for recognizing homosexual
couples.
 &HT;    In short, despite the extreme political violence of the `60s,
there has been no post-`68 ``culture war'' in Europe. And the
culture warriors so familiar to us _ aging `68 professors promoting
the Glorious Revolution, agitated conservative journalists
portraying America as Gomorrah _ are nowhere to be found.
 -0- 
 &HT;    All revolutions inevitably face the same crisis: how to bring
themselves to a close. This is because revolutionary success
depends on stirring up passions that subsequently prove difficult
to cool. With modern revolutions such passions are even more
difficult to calm because they are accompanied by revolutions in
ideas, which have a way of digging in their heels and resisting
retirement after they have been overtaken by events.
 &HT;    To the extent that the European `60s revolution was driven by an
idea, it was an old conception of political revolution that had
been born in 1789, revived in 1917 and began collapsing after World
War II under the weight of a new social reality and its own evident
failures around the globe.
 &HT;    The `60s were about the end of this tradition in Europe, and
perhaps that is why they are finally over. European culture has
been, and continues to be, reformed in light of that experience,
but not in the shadow of the revolutionary ideal.
 &HT;    The American `60s were also about an idea, though not about
burying it. For better or worse, our cultural revolution has now
entered the pantheon of victories for the American democratic
project and there it will remain, flanked on one side by the
abolition of slavery and segregation and on the other by an empty
altar reserved for heroes of the next campaign.
 &HT;    Americans today see the `60s as continuing a native tradition,
not as departing from it, and in this respect our revolution was
more conservative than the European one. It does not, at least in
public perception, represent a break in our history.
 &HT;    Yet the reason this revolution continues to haunt us is that by
breaking down the last fences between democratic politics and
culture, it entered unexplored territory. And there it has begun to
lose its bearings and cause some harm _ to our families, our
schools, our cultural institutions, our public life and, indeed, to
our psychological well-being.
 &HT;    These harms are real, not the figment of the conservative
imagination. But they are virtually impossible for pro- and
anti-`68 partisans to consider dispassionately, so strong is the
grip of the democratic idea on us all.
 &HT;    Even American conservatives today can find no compelling
democratic reason to question the extension of the democratic
principle to the realms of morals, sex, family and education, which
means they can find no reason at all.
 &HT;    In this sense, our `60s are over too: We are all `68ers now. And
that is our problem. We are anxious about the America the `68
revolution has bequeathed us, but we avoid thinking too deeply
about it, fearing, perhaps with good reason, that our faith _ our
all-encompassing democratic faith _ might not stand the test.

DRUG PROBLEM WOUNDS ALL TOUCHED BY IT

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - (begin ital) I'm not like that guy who cut off his
kid's head. (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   The words of a crystal meth addict _ my little girl's father.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) I would never do something like that. . . . You
know I would never do anything to hurt you or (our daughter). (end
ital)
</P>
<P>
   Words meant to comfort and reassure, but didn't.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was not like Eric Starr Smith, the Arizona man who
two years ago decapitated his son and threw the head out of a
moving vehicle. He said he could manage crystal, just as he, the
``expert drunk driver,'' managed his beer.
</P>
<P>
   This talented, well-educated, middle-age man said he had
everything under control, even as his life was falling apart in
huge chunks. In his view, his major problems were nothing more than
misperceptions and harsh judgments.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) There's really a hysteria over (crystal meth). . .
. It's sort of like 'Reefer Madness.' . . . It's really not that
bad. (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   That was the drugs talking, and there's no arguing with drugs
like crystal meth.
</P>
<P>
   Some say there's no fighting them either. The general in charge
of our nation's drug policy said ``we won't ever win this war'' _
mostly because it's not a war.
</P>
<P>
   But to not fight is to lose everything.
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons for hysteria over crystal meth. Mine is
in kindergarten. Her big, brown intelligent eyes see everything,
including her father's pain.
</P>
<P>
   How do you explain crystal methamphetamine to a 5-year-old? For
that matter, how do you fully explain orders of protection and
supervised visitation? Or those IOUs Daddy left in her piggy bank?
</P>
<P>
   ``A contributing factor or dominant factor of any major problem
in our society is the abuse of illegal drugs or alcohol,'' Barry
McCaffrey, the nation's drug czar, told ``The Arizona Republic's''
editorial board. ``Most of us can use alcohol and not have a
problem with it. Most of us can't use methamphetamine and not have
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrible threat to all of us,'' McCaffrey said. ``It's
everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona is a hot spot for crystal meth use and production. Law
enforcement officials have broken up more than 200 meth labs this
year, compared with 130 in all of 1997, according to Capt. Steve
Werner of the Special Investigations Division of the Maricopa
County Sheriff's Office, a co-director of a statewide meth task
force.
</P>
<P>
   Meth labs can pop up in any neighborhood _ homes, apartments
even trunks of cars. Meth cookers, many of them speed freaks
themselves, use over-the-counter drugs and household products to
build and operate unstable labs. Fumes from meth labs can cause
brain damage.
</P>
<P>
   Meth is cheap, powerful and versatile _ the ``poor man's coke''
that can be smoked, snorted, ingested or injected.
</P>
<P>
   When speed freaks are up, they feel they can do anything. Some
of them die trying.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) I like the way it makes me feel.(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   `` '' When they crash, they suffer depression and develop
suicidal tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) Maybe I should just check out. (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   ``'' ``Meth is typified by the craziness of the individuals
using the drug,'' Werner said. ``They can be schizo, with no level
of reasonableness.''
</P>
<P>
   My little girl's father saw self-righteousness, not prudence,
behind efforts to put a safe wall _ not a locked door _ between his
daughter and his addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Crystal doesn't like prudence. It's also a jealous lover.
Everything always comes back to it.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) You're going to take my daughter away from me, huh?
Well, you little bitch, you're going to end up not seeing your
daughter ever again. . . . I'm at the (expletive) end where it's
going to be sayonara, bitch. So you better (expletive) get ahold of
me, get some (expletive) money over here, so I can get some wheels,
or when I do see (our daughter), I will take her and you will never
see her again. (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   Meth cuts a wide swath as it takes the user down a personal path
of destruction. It has the power to define all of our lives.
</P>
<P>
   Crystal meth means sleeping fully clothed with the phone near
the pillow, pepper spray under the mattress and a softball bat
within arm's reach.
</P>
<P>
   It prompts quick trips to safe places masqueraded as vacation
getaways.
</P>
<P>
   Crystal meth causes a trembling little girl to cling to her
mom's leg, as she listens to a conversation with a 911 operator.
</P>
<P>
   It brings on stress, the kind of stress, a pediatrician says,
that triggers chest pains and headaches.
</P>
<P>
   It abuses loyal friends.
</P>
<P>
   Crystal meth can turn a good-hearted soul into a raving,
desperate paranoid.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said we don't have a national drug problem, but a
series of local drug epidemics.
</P>
<P>
   It's even more basic than that. Our drug problems are
all-or-nothing battles waged inside mentally and emotionally
damaged individuals. Victory _ peace and hope _ rests on nothing
more substantial than wispy words such as those told recently to a
brown-eyed girl.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) I'm going to try to get better. (end ital)  &QL;

BRITISH INVADING ARIZONA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER CORBETT  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - A 1960s British Invasion brought the Beatles, Rolling
Stones and Yardbirds to U.S. shores. Now, a late '90s version is
making noise in Arizona that has tourism officials applauding.
</P>
<P>
   The United Kingdom has become Arizona's No. 1 overseas tourism
market with 193,000 visitors in 1997, a 58 percent increase from
1995.
</P>
<P>
   The wave of British visitors is due in part to the success of
British Airways' direct flight from London to Phoenix, said Mark
McDermott, director of the Arizona Office of Tourism.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways began flying direct to Phoenix in July 1996 with
a 212-seat DC-10. It switched to a 400-seat Boeing 747-400 in late
March to accommodate heavy demand on the daily route to Sky Harbor
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The airline has an average load factor, the number of occupied
seats, of 87 percent for the flights to and from London, said Ken
Melidoni, British Airways' director of sales in the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix market has ``been a wonderful addition to our
network'' and British Airways continues to see an increase in
passengers from the United Kingdom and Europe flying direct from
London to Sky Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   In August, 6,568 passengers flew on British Airways to Phoenix,
compared to 4,053 in August 1997, Melidoni said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've really heightened the awareness of the Southwest in the
United Kingdom, Europe and the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   Next week, the Scottish Passengers Agents Association is
bringing 28 travel industry professionals to tour Arizona, Melidoni
said.
</P>
<P>
   And Arizona is featured this month in ``Highlife,'' British
Airways' in-flight magazine. It's the third year in a row the
magazine has highlighted Arizona, Melidoni said.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Warner, Sky Harbor deputy aviation director, said it was
impressive how quickly British Airways has been able to increase
the number of seats it fills on its Phoenix flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt it's been a tremendous impact, and has far
exceeded our expectations,'' she said of British Airways' entry
into the Phoenix market.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996-97, the total direct and indirect economic impact of the
British Airways route was $261 million and 3,493 jobs, according to
a Sky Harbor report. That is expected to increase to $656 million
and 8,753 jobs in 2000-01.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in tourism from the United Kingdom coincides with a
decline in visitation from Germany because of an economic downturn
there, McDermott said.
</P>
<P>
   German tourism to Arizona dropped from about 210,000 in 1996 to
176,000 last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The British pound is holding its value against the dollar, so
Arizona will continue to be popular with British travelers,
McDermott said.
</P>
<P>
   Sky Harbor reports an increase of arriving international
passengers from 25,912 in June 1997 to 34,241 this June, a jump of
32.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   International visitors tend to stay longer and spend more money.
A Sky Harbor survey of international travelers on British Airways
from last September to June showed that three out of five were
staying in Arizona longer than a week and one of four was staying
longer than two weeks. Domestic travelers average about 4.2 days in
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also indicated that 46 percent of the foreign
visitors spent more than $75 per night on a hotel, and 24 percent
of them reported an annual income of more than $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   And roughly half of the British Airways travelers were on a
repeat visit to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Squire, director of United Kingdom promotions for the
Arizona Office of Tourism, said he is working to bring more British
visitors to Arizona on their first trip to the United States. Many
of them don't make it here until their second, third or fourth
trip, after they have visited New York, Florida and California,
said Squire, who works in London for a partnership of Arizona
convention and visitors' bureaus, the Arizona Office of Tourism and
Sky Harbor Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Another challenge is trying to induce British tourists to stay
longer, Squire said. Most tours include visits to the Grand Canyon
and Monument Valley, but Squire said there is a push to get
visitors to visit the eastern part of the state, such as the White
Mountains. &QL;

MOTHER, TEACHER MOONLIGHTS AS AN ELITE TRIATHLETE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUZZ GRAY  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Bonnie Morse-Gillham hops out of bed not long
after some people are turning off Letterman.
</P>
<P>
   There's simply no other way for this 42-year-old mother of four
to live three lives. She's there for her family, meets the
responsibilities of a full-time job plus answers the demands of an
elite triathlete. It smacks of contradiction, for sure. Yet
Morse-Gillham juggles the roles as adeptly as a circus performer.
Of course, nobody said anything about sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I've always been a hyperactive person,'' said the
Albany resident who rises at 2 a.m. to begin chipping away at a
daily itinerary which would exhaust a mosquito.
</P>
<P>
   Those miles and miles and miles across roads, in the water and
on a bike have paid off. Morse-Gillham capped a remarkable
four-month revival by qualifying for the 20th annual Ironman World
Championship in Hawaii. She departs Sept. 23 for the Oct. 3 event
after surprising herself as well as most others by winning her age
group in a triathlon at Allentown, Pa., last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what to expect,'' said Morse-Gillham, who gave
up the demanding sport more than two years ago only to realize she
forgot something.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left part of my soul in those lava fields of Hawaii,'' she
said about her previous experience in the Ironman back in 1994.
``It was the worst experience of my life, including childbirth.''
</P>
<P>
   Her back hurt so much in the biking portion of the triathlon,
she was forced to dismount and rest. Eventually, though, she was
back over the pedals and actually walked the 26-mile marathon
segment in a time (five hours) some people take to run it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five months passed before I recovered,'' Morse-Gillham said
about the back injury that originally flared up four months before
the Ironman.
</P>
<P>
   This time she's healthy, fit as a fig and better prepared,
giving herself more than a week to get acclimated to the difference
in time zones.
</P>
<P>
   ``My oldest daughter (17-year-old Jamie) is going with me,'' the
5-foot-6-inch, 120-pound Morse-Gillham said. ``It will probably be
our last mother-daughter thing before she goes off to college.''
</P>
<P>
   First up, however, is this little matter of swimming 2 1/2
miles, biking another 112 and running those 26 more. Morse-Gillham
is already in fast company since more than 25,000 triathletes from
throughout the world vied for the Ironman. Only 1,500 qualified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally, I had no intention of going back,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when I qualified unexpectedly at Allentown, Pennsylvania,
my husband (Jeff) urged me to seize the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The trip to Hawaii is telling testimony to her remarkable
athleticism and dedication. Training consumes five hours out of
every day. In a week, she'll ride between 250 and 300 miles on her
bike. Morse-Gillham's running covers between 40 and 50 miles a
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have mapped out these loops around the streets near my
house,'' she said. ``It enables me to come in and eat while I'm
running.''
</P>
<P>
   Since most triathlons require more than 10 hours to complete,
participants must learn how to nourish themselves during the
endeavor. It's a case where ``eating on the run'' is taken
literally.
</P>
<P>
   Few triathletes try ingesting nutrients while in the water.
That's not to say they can't. But compared to the two other
disciplines, the swimming segment is by far the shortest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I swim a mile every day except on Friday,'' said the former
All-American at Springfield College in Springfield, Mass. ``On that
day, I swim two and a half miles.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, that should be Morse-Gillham's best discipline.
</P>
<P>
   ``For one reason or another, it hasn't always worked out that
way,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One advantage for Morse-Gillham is that she's a physical
education teacher at Albany Academy, a job that gives her access to
the school's pool for those pre-dawn laps.
</P>
<P>
   News of her triathlon accomplishments have spread among her
students who have become active supporters. Triathletes, in
general, can use all the support they can get. Winners get
trophies, not fat checks. They usually pay their own transportation
costs, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``My bike will have to last me the rest of my life,''
Morse-Gillham said. ``And I got my treadmill by picking it out of
the trash.''
</P>
<P>
   The real payoff comes from within. Converting one's body into a
personal test tube is a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really neat to see just how far you can push yourself, at
what age you start dropping off,'' she said. Thus far, she hasn't
found out.

ESPN PICKS SAN FRANCISCO FOR '99 X GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GREGORY LEWIS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Skysurfing, skateboarding, in-line skating,
street luge and downhill in-line skating _ among other alternative
sports _ are headed to San Francisco next summer.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN, the cable sports network, announced Wednesday it would
hold the 1999 X Games _ as in Extreme Sports _ in the city June 25
through July 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleased and excited to welcome ESPN and the X Games to
San Francisco,'' Mayor Willie Brown said. ``The city's high-energy
youth culture will fit perfectly with this family-oriented and
dynamic event.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco beat St. Petersburg, Fla., Seattle and Rhode
Island, which hosted the games in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Ruhe, ESPN senior vice president for event management,
said, ``San Francisco has been on our wish list since we started
the X Games in 1995. Every two years we have brought the X Games to
a larger market, and now we are very excited to be welcomed to a
city of San Francisco's size and cultural diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he expected the games to ``pay eons of dividends to
San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   Kofi Bonner, the mayor's chief economic policy adviser, said the
city's general fund would not be tapped and that $750,000 _ about
$200,000 of which would be generated through parking fees _ would
be raised from private sources. ESPN would help find those donors.
</P>
<P>
   Ruhe said the event would require 10,000 hotel rooms. In
addition, it will draw 450 athletes from all over the world, some
2,000 volunteers and more than 100 television cameras.
</P>
<P>
   This year's games in San Diego attracted more than 240,000
people and pumped more than $31 million into the city's economy,
according to the University of San Diego School of Business.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN will open offices on Treasure Island and bring in about 25
employees almost immediately to begin planning for the 1999 games.
</P>
<P>
   The network plans to air more than 40 hours of live coverage to
potentially 75 million households in the United States and 250
million more around the world. Last year's games drew 19 million
viewers, about 5 million more than in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be plenty of opportunities to postcard the beauty
of San Francisco,'' Ruhe said.
</P>
<P>
   The games feature aggressive in-line skating, bicycle stunt
riding, skateboarding, sportclimbing and big air snowboarding.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN has a two-year deal with the city. But after the 1999
games, both parties will talk and determine if they are in
agreement before the 2000 games proceed.

MATT DAMON, GRETCHEN MOL ON WAY TO THE TOP 
</HEADLINE>
 DAMON-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB FENSTER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - If Hollywood was a betting game, the smart money would
line up behind Matt Damon and Gretchen Mol to become the next
superstars.
</P>
<P>
   Mol and Damon star in ``Rounders,'' the story of a law student
who risks his future in a poker game. The film opens Friday (Aug.
11)
</P>
<P>
   Damon is already on his way to the top of Hollywood's invisible
mountain after his major breakthroughs as the star of ``The
Rainmaker,'' star and co-writer of ``Good Will Hunting'' and object
of protection in ``Saving Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   For Damon, it all began with running 17 miles a day. He kept up
that pace for three months so he could lose 40 pounds and attain
the junkie look that played so well in his breakthrough role as a
soldier driven to drugs by memories of war in ``Courage Under
Fire''.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went on medication for three months after that,'' Damon
said. ``When the reviews for `Courage Under Fire' came out, my name
wasn't even mentioned. But the right people saw it, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Those people included two influential directors, Francis Ford
Coppola and Steven Spielberg, both of whom decided they wanted
Damon for future projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been lucky,'' Damon said.
</P>
<P>
   Coppola asked Damon to screen-test for ``The Rainmaker.'' As he
went into the test, Damon recalled, ``They told me I had a 95
percent chance of not getting the part. But you do it as honestly
as you can and hope that's what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   It was. After two weeks that Damon described as ``the longest
wait in my life,'' he landed the starring role in ``The Rainmaker''
as a young Memphis lawyer battling a powerful insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation, Damon moved to Memphis and got a job tending bar
to research his character and how the locals behaved.
</P>
<P>
   He had used a Texas accent for the screen test because his
girlfriend at the time was from Texas. In the Memphis bar, he got
the accent down right.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great way to do research,'' he said of bartending.
``You're pouring them drinks and asking them questions, and they
start talking.''
</P>
<P>
   While starring in ``The Rainmaker,'' Damon also was writing the
script to ``Good Will Hunting'' with his old friend and fellow
rising star, Ben Affleck.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did `Good Will Hunting' to get our acting careers going,''
he said. They wrote 1,500 pages around the characters of a
working-class genius and his down-to-earth buddy while searching
for a story to put them in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our theory was: You have enough great moments, put them
together and get a great director, then let him worry about the
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not great writers. We're actors. If we can get the
characters, hopefully a story will come out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Damon was right. Not only did ``Good Will Hunting'' become one
of last year's most popular films, it also earned him an Oscar
nomination for acting and an Oscar for writing.
</P>
<P>
   It also turned him into a heartthrob.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't take it too seriously,'' he said. ``A year ago I
could walk into a room and not turn any heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a young girl knows who I am, I say, `How do you know who
I am?' I wonder why their parents let them see my movies. They're
R-rated. `Good Will Hunting' is a movie for adults, not kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Damon sees his career as an actor as ``a 40-year growth curve.''
To make that happen, he learned a valuable lesson from ``Saving
Private'' ``Ryan'' co-star Tom Hanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will never take a movie that's not in his heart,'' Damon
said. ``Tom has passed on movies that did huge business, but he
will say he couldn't do it because it wasn't his passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took a lot away from that. It has to be in your heart. It's
like Tom has a contract with every single ticket buyer. They know
he is honoring his contract every time, that he's not just out for
a payday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe in the movies I've made. That's the only
reason I've done them.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hanks laughed when told that Damon was emulating him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no advice I can give him about his career,'' Hanks
said, ``except that you're always one movie away from the Dorothy
Chandler Pavilion (where the Oscars are handed out).''
</P>
<P>
   Damon may get close to a second Oscar for playing the
sought-after paratrooper in ``Saving Private Ryan.'' Spielberg had
him pegged for the role ever since seeing him in ``Courage Under
Fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Damon is the second name star in ``Saving Private
Ryan,'' he doesn't even show up till the movie is half over. But he
had no complaints about playing a small role.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like getting the call to the big leagues,'' he said. ``So
I'm batting eighth? You don't complain.''
</P>
<P>
   Damon recalled the first time he watched the finished film.
``It's the first movie I've ever seen that I forgot I was in it,''
he said. ``That D-Day sequence _ I was horrified. It got me in
touch with my generation. Are we holding up our end of the bargain?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Normandy invasion was the turning point of the century.
We're representing people who gave their lives to it. It's a huge
task. You don't want to let them down.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Saving Private Ryan,'' Damon was in a cast with four other
actors who had directed pictures. As a writer, he tried to take
advantage of that opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was handing scripts to Eddie Burns and Tom Hanks, saying
`check this out, maybe we could to this together.' But I got no
nibbles.''
</P>
<P>
   On the set, Spielberg showed them ``Escape to Nowhere,'' the
first war film he shot as a 13-year-old high school student in
Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has shots in that movie he used later in ``Raiders of the
Lost ``Ark,'' Damon said, expressing awe of a director who showed
that much talent at such a young age.
</P>
<P>
   Damon plans to direct his own movies some day. ``We'll do it on
something we wrote so we don't mess up someone else's script,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Damon and Affleck are working on another script together. ``But
it's becoming a logistical nightmare trying to find time for the
both of us to write together. We'll write a couple of hundred pages
of something and it won't work.''
</P>
<P>
   What's the next one about? They don't have a story yet, but it
will be about similar characters to the guys in ``Good Will
Hunting.'' ``We knew those characters so well we'll probably stick
to them next time. But we won't do a sequel.''
</P>
<P>
   He laughs, picturing a Hollywood sequel: ``More Good Will
Hunting'' _ this time it's for the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though you can't bet money on Hollywood fame futures, guys
would still be lining up for Damon's ``Rounders'' co-star Gretchen
Mol.
</P>
<P>
   She has the classical beauty of a star from another era and that
rare quality that Meryl Streep, Meg Ryan and Julia Roberts showed
early in their careers: She can romance you through a camera.
</P>
<P>
   Mol, who is featured in a beauty spread in ``Vanity Fair''
magazine this month, stands on the verge of a major breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   She almost had that breakthrough with her first starring role as
the woman who must decide between her fiance and the pursuit of a
passionate Jude Law in ``Music From Another Room.''
</P>
<P>
   That film played in the Valley last spring as a test run.
Despite its success locally, the studio did not release it
nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the strangest thing I've known,'' Mol said. ``The movie
got tossed around a lot. At one point, they were gung-ho about it.
Then there was nothing going on. I don't know what to make of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mol's luck failed with that movie, but she rebounded strongly
with some of the best timing in the industry: She signed to make
films opposite young actors who then became two of the hottest in
the industry _ Damon in ``Rounders'' and Leonardo DiCaprio in Woody
Allen's upcoming rumination on fame, ``Celebrity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was timing, the luck of the draw,'' Mol said. ``It wasn't
anything I planned.''
</P>
<P>
   American women may want to know who is the more romantic of the
two _ Damon or DiCaprio _ but Mol demurred, ``I can't answer that.
I didn't come away with the experience of Kate Winslet in
``Titanic.'' But we had a fun time on ``Celebrity.'' Leonardo was
as in awe of Woody Allen as I was.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Damon, Mol said, ``He is exactly as he comes across. He
has a real understanding of film. It gives him confidence so he can
be spontaneous and have a good time with the material. I hope we
can work together again some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Both of them may be too busy for that to happen soon.
</P>
<P>
   Mol originally studied for the musical theater but switched to
movie training under the influence of her brother, a film editor.
</P>
<P>
   She got her first break in Spike Lee's ``Girl 6,'' in which she
had a small role as a phone sex operator. She followed that with
small roles in small movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can make enough money doing small projects,'' she said.
``So you have to ask, `What do I really need to live on?' ''
</P>
<P>
   As for ``Music From Another Room,'' Mol said, ``I was nervous
going in. I didn't have a lot of confidence. When I look back at
the film, I see myself fighting against my instincts.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mol gained confidence in time to work with Woody Allen,
whose approach is different from most directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't ask Woody a lot of questions,'' Mol said. ``You have
so much trust in him because of his past work. With Woody, it's all
about spontaneity.''
</P>
<P>
   To achieve that spontaneous reaction from actors, Allen doesn't
give them the entire script, only the pages for the scenes they'll
be shooting. He often doesn't tell them which actors they'll work
with in the scene until they start filming.
</P>
<P>
   ``The constant surprises are good,'' Mol said. ``You don't have
a lot of room to intellectualize about your role. It frees you of
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Mol will follow ``Celebrity'' with a science-fiction mystery,
``The 13th Floor,'' and ``Cherry Pink,'' a comedy directed by Jason
Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mol finds herself being considered for starring roles
in major pictures. ``There are things looming,'' she said,
``projects I never would have been considered for a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm in a different league. I'm the new kid. That's
exciting for some people who want to capture that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm now a small fish in a much bigger pond, so the
rejection hurts all the more.'' &QL;

`ROUNDERS' PLAYS WEAK HAND 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   UNDATED - Remember that great poker game used to bait the sucker
in ``The Sting''? Better yet, the brilliant poker sequences that
were integral parts of the con games within con games in the
masterful ``House of Games''?
</P>
<P>
   But ``The Sting'' and ``House of Games'' weren't about poker.
They used poker to advance bigger, more interesting stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rounders'' is about poker.
</P>
<P>
   Director John Dahl's efforts to take us inside the world of
poker hustlers don't pay off. It's like observing a 60-hour poker
marathon: It runs on way too long and you're not going to walk away
with much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rounders'' fails despite the efforts of three of Hollywood's
rising young stars: Matt Damon, Edward Norton and Gretchen Mol.
</P>
<P>
   Damon plays a role that diverts us from the story with
inevitable comparisons to his breakthrough hit, ``Good Will
Hunting.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Rounders,'' Damon is Mike McDermott, a hotshot poker player
who has raised himself up from poverty by being smart enough and
good enough to fleece the suckers. He's using poker to finance his
education through law school.
</P>
<P>
   Mike's major weakness: loyalty to his high school buddy, Worm
(Norton), a hustler who's also a mechanic. He cheats.
</P>
<P>
   Just out of prison, Worm is in serious debt to a menacing loan
shark, and he drags down Mike with him, to the point where both of
them have to play high-stakes poker to save their lives.
</P>
<P>
   This is particularly troublesome for Mike, who has promised his
girlfriend (Mol) that he will quit poker to concentrate on his
studies and her.
</P>
<P>
   You can probably see where this is going: the big showdown game
with all the chips on the table.
</P>
<P>
   But it takes the plodding plot forever to get there. By the time
it does, we don't really care who wins what.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rounders'' rides on what director Dahl has to say about the
game of poker: the strategies of hustling and reading other
players' hustles.
</P>
<P>
   But Dahl ``(The Last Seduction)'' doesn't think of any way to
demonstrate these ploys during the action of the movie, what with
everyone holding their cards and their cons close to the vest.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he has Damon explain the thinking behind the bluffs
through voice-over narration. Like a book, Damon's thoughts become
the most interesting part of the movie: ``If you can't spot the
sucker in your first half-hour at the table, then you are the
sucker.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the movie has the dramatic punch of a pair of
deuces.
</P>
<P>
   Dahl doesn't even show off his three stars to their advantage.
Damon plays the most constricted character of his young career:,
not saying much, showing less. We want to emphasize with his
put-upon hustler, but it's hard to do.
</P>
<P>
   Norton (``Primal Fear'') enlivens the movie as a more animated
hustler. But we quickly see that he's playing only one note
throughout.
</P>
<P>
   Mol has nothing but the girl part to work with, and the
scriptwriters don't give her much. She creates none of the romantic
magic that elevated ``Music From Another Room.'' She doesn't click
with Damon, nor he with her.
</P>
<P>
   More interesting in minor roles are John Malkovich and John
Turturro, as professional poker players in the Russian and New York
styles, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rounders'' is not an unintelligent movie. But it's curiously
unexciting.
</P>
<P>
   If you're not a poker player, then much of the goings-on may
seem too obscure. If you are a player, you'd probably rather be out
playing your own games than watching two actors do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rounders'' is rated R for profanity and nudity. 2 stars. &QL;

 &HT;    With RUSSIA-PRIMAKOV
 &HT;    YELTSIN PICKS PRIMAKOV AS COMPROMISE PM
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Boris Yeltsin yielded to opponents Thursday
and nominated Foreign Minister Yvegeny Primakov as a compromise
candidate for prime minister, ending for now Russia's debilitating
political standoff amid a grim economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   It was an embarrassing and uncharacteristic political surrender
for Yeltsin, who was forced to abandon his original choice for
prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   The respected Primakov, 68, was almost universally hailed
Thursday by leaders across the Russian political spectrum. The
Duma, the lower house of parliament, was expected to confirm his
nomination in a vote scheduled for Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Common sense has prevailed in our state,'' said Communist
leader Gennady Zyuganov, who represents the largest bloc of votes
in the 450-member Duma.
</P>
<P>
   A Soviet-era journalist and bureaucrat, Primakov has been a
loyal assistant to Yeltsin, serving five years as chief of the
Russia's foreign spy service and as foreign minister since January
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Yet his nomination as prime minister _ surprising if only
because he said a day earlier he did not want the job _ signalled
an unprecedented measure of authority for the Communist-led
opposition, which has sought to pressure the unpopular Yeltsin for
power-sharing compromises amid the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The Duma had been ready to reject Chernomyrdin's nomination for
a third time and confront Yeltsin with impeachment proceedings.
Russian political and church leaders had warned that an extended
impasse could lead to civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Some political analysts believed Yeltsin's concession was yet
another sign that he will step down before the end of his term in
2000. It marks the first time the president has acquiesced to his
Communist Party adversaries on a matter of political control since
the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is compromise, not confrontation. Finally, Yeltsin has made
a decision to avoid prolonging this situation. To continue the
confrontation could have had disastrous results for the country,''
said Andrei Piontkovsky, director of the Strategic Studies Center,
a Moscow think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov is thin on economic experience, but enjoys a reputation
as an astute and apolitical Kremlin adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Grigory Yavlinsky, the leader of the liberal democratic Yabloko
party who formally recommended Primakov earlier in the week, said
the nomination was ``a move towards stabilization. It will mean the
country has found a way out of the crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   As foreign minister, Primakov has earned broad support at home
as a respected and persuasive diplomat working to restore Russia's
image in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Chiefly, Russian communists and nationalists who otherwise
disdain Yeltsin's regime have lauded Primakov for his vocal
opposition to U.S. policy on issues such as sanctions against Iraq
and NATO's eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Chernomyrdin and others mentioned as possible choices for
prime minister, Primakov has no apparent ambitions to succeed
Yeltsin as president. It counts as another element in his favor as
political parties position themselves for presidential elections
scheduled for 2000, but which could come earlier.
</P>
<P>
   As a familiar face in global diplomacy, Primakov's nomination
was welcomed by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, White House press secretary Mike McCurry said the
U.S. ``knows and respects Foreign Minister Primakov ... We would
expect to have a good and close working relationship with Prime
Minister Primakov.''
</P>
<P>
   Approval by the Duma on Friday will allow the Kremlin to
assemble a new government after nearly three weeks in limbo. It was
unclear how much of a role opposition parties would play in forming
the cabinet under Primakov.
</P>
<P>
   Critical questions also remained over how Russia will overcome
its severe economic turmoil, including the weakened ruble, rising
prices, massive government debts and a banking system on the verge
of collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main question for this country's future is who will be Mr.
Primakov's team, who will be his economic man?'' said Boris
Makarenko of the Center for Political Technologies, a Moscow think
tank.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow's financial community viewed the Primakov nomination as
an encouraging sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best we can hope for under the circumstances,'' said
Neil Greer, chief executive officer of Regent European Securities
Limited.
</P>
<P>
   Financial markets rose on the news and the battered ruble
climbed in value for a second day, although economists warned it
was probably a temporary phenomenon. After falling as low as 22
rubles a dollar earlier this week, on Thursday it rose to 12-13
rubles to the dollar in interbank trading. A month ago, the ruble
was 6.2 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Russian consumers have been faced with massive price increases
and food shortages, caused in part by panic buying.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have the situation similar to what existed at the start
of free-market reforms, when the stores were empty and people had
their fridges filled to capacity,'' Ivan Starikov, a deputy
economics minister, told a news conference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin last week had announced he would impose an
``economic dictatorship'' to overcome the crisis, including steps
for some state control over the economy and the printing of more
rubles.
</P>
<P>
   His departure Thursday probably marked the end of his
presidential aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   A clearly resentful Chernomyrdin went on national television to
warn of ``a creeping coup.'' The Duma's refusal to confirm him was
a scheme by the Communists and other opposition parties to usurp
power and force Yeltsin to resign, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin served as prime minister from December 1992 until
March of this year when he was fired by Yeltsin. The president
recalled him on Aug. 23 to lead the government amid the worsening
financial situation. The Duma twice rejected him, most recently on
Monday, holding him largely responsible for Russia's economic
troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Chernomyrdin today is a stumbling block and splits society
then I give up my powers,'' he said on television.

DREAMY `EDEN' FINDS DEPTH IN ORDINARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - ``Eden'' is profoundly ordinary, with an emphasis on
both words.
</P>
<P>
   It is a little film, a spawn of the current ``indie'' film
movement, but it tackles large subjects. It will not appeal to
anyone trained by Hollywood to expect car chases, gunfire and
plas-thetically pneumatic women in rippling tank tops.
</P>
<P>
   Neither will it appeal to a younger caffeine-zapped audience
curried to expect ironically witty dialogue, trendy fashions or the
piling up of in-jokes about film-world insiders. This is neither
``Blade'' nor ``Scream 2''.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, like many other indie films, it finds its way around
the limitations of a small budget by substituting character
development and plot. Let us hope the idea catches on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eden'' takes place in 1965, a world exactly halfway between
Eisenhower and Jimi Hendrix. Students at posh Mt. Eden Prep School
are beginning to chafe at the collars and ties around their necks
and have taken up guitars. Yet, they are still oddly polite and
obedient.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Kunen (Dylan Walsh) is a teacher whose answer to all the
problems in life is to suck it up and endure. He is as much drill
sergeant as teacher.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Helen (Joanna Going), suffers from multiple sclerosis
and walks awkwardly with a leg brace. Their children and their
vacuum cleaner take up almost all of her life.
</P>
<P>
   She escapes both disease and conventionality in dreams, which
she comes to believe is actual out-of-body travel. All her pain and
suffering vanish as she coasts across clouds and into the cosmos.
</P>
<P>
   The crux of the film concerns whether Helen should return from
her dreaming, or let go and float forever, perhaps into death.
</P>
<P>
   All of which sounds as if ``Eden'' must be filled with wonderful
visual effects. But it is not. The few snippets of vision we see
are merely fuzzy. It isn't that the special effects are poor, but
that the movie doesn't value effect only for effect. We are much
more interested in how the visions affect Helen than in what the
visions look like.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Helen does project astrally, or whether she merely
dreams, becomes irrelevant. What is relevant is that she grows; she
comes to understand the vastness and beauty of Creation. She begins
telling fellow faculty wives about it, in terms that are a clumsy
version of the upper reaches of Hinduism.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, they just think she is dotty.
</P>
<P>
   The very ordinariness of their lives helps make the sense of
miraculous all the more profound.
</P>
<P>
   The film captures the stylized formality of the time, down to
the darts and starch of Helen's clothes.
</P>
<P>
   The second theme of the film concerns the slow softening of
Bill, who manages to change believably from demanding Alpha Male to
a caring, listening, loving human being. It is a subtext of the
film that the feminization of men is necessary to their
humanization. The film makes a good case.
</P>
<P>
   The performances of Going and Walsh, along with the rebellious
student of Sean Patrick Flanery, are wonderfully acted and nuanced.
They create utterly believable characters that we come to care
about fully.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as moving as the film turns out to be by the finish, there
are problems along the way, miscalculations by director Howard
Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most glaring is the casting as high school juniors of
a handful of 30-somethings. These do not look like teenagers, but
like graduate students. It is nearly impossible to suspend
disbelief enough to accept Mt. Eden as a high school.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the dialogue is perhaps a bit too ordinary. Goldberg has
done everything he can to make the film seem real rather than
artifice, but the words that come out of the mouths of the actors
seem a little flatter than they need to be to make the point.
</P>
<P>
   And, unlike so many recent indie films, Goldberg's direction
never surprises us. It is competent and straightforward but doesn't
sparkle. It is as if the act of filmmaking leaves Goldberg
completely indifferent; the only thing that matters is the content
and meaning, not the style and presentation.
</P>
<P>
   But who am I to complain of such a thing, when the main problem
in movie theaters is the complete lack of content and meaning?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Goldberg is on to something.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eden,'' rated PG-13, has little to offend sensitive audiences,
except some profanity uttered at a moment of extreme duress. 3
stars. &QL;

 &HT;    Hyper-topical `Place' mired in melodrama
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL SEPTEMBER 13: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By J. Edwin Smith
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Best-selling author Richard North Patterson, gambling that his
audience has an unquenchable appetite for voyeurism, allows us to
peek through the White House curtains in this overblown soap opera
of art imitating life.
</P>
<P>
   If you're unable to make it through the day without a double
dose of the sexual escapades of Bill and Monica, then this sucker
is for you. There's plenty to keep your heart going pitter-patter:
a divorced president (a year 2000 version of Jack Kennedy) trying
to keep a past love affair under wraps while fighting the
never-ending nightmare of a brother who died by an assassin's
bullet while running for president, talking heads from the
broadcast media trying their best to break this story, another
talking head trying her damnedest to keep the affair under wraps,
and, to keep action freaks from dozing off, an assassin stalking
the president's every move.
</P>
<P>
   And you thought ``Melrose Place'' was cool.
</P>
<P>
   Picking the pocket of today's headlines, Patterson spares no
literary expense in inundating us with some of humankind's greatest
fears _ fervent anti-abortion opponents, the Christian Coalition
and NRA, and Republicans large and small _ as he bounces us back
and forth, from past to present and past again, laying the
groundwork for an uplifting climax that could have been achieved
200 pages earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The redeeming factor of this novel is that the book's star,
Kerry Kilcannon, is about as close to being a political god as
we'll probably ever see. Kilcannon is a Boy Scout in a three-piece
suit, a man of truth, justice, compassion and wisdom _ ingredients
that no longer seem to qualify a person for our nation's highest
office.
</P>
<P>
   In real life, I'd not only vote for Kilcannon, but I'd also care
about his trials and tribulations. In this fictional arena,
however, I'm more apt to repeat Rhett's parting comment to
Scarlett.

 &HT;    Behind the scenes of ``Elaborate Lives: The Legend of Aida: A
look at performers, production
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL SEPTEMBER 13: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert

   The Designs
</P>
<P>
   THE DESIGNS
</P>
<P>
   Director Robert Jess Roth says he visualizes ``Elaborate Lives''
in a world that's reminiscent of ancient Egypt but takes place,
``Once upon a time, in a galaxy far, far away. ...''
</P>
<P>
   In that Spielbergian spirit, Stanley Meyer, Roth's set designer
sidekick from ``Beauty and the Beast'' (who spent five years as art
director for Disneyland) used space-age computer imaging to design
his pivotal _ and pivoting _ pyramid. The 40-year-old artist sounds
like a kid with the coolest toy on the block.
</P>
<P>
   ``This creation keeps morphing,'' says Meyer, holding up a
pyramid model the size of a four-slice toaster. ``Open it up, add
some oars and it's a barge on the Nile. Spin it the other way, and
it's the palace steps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It starts out as a dominant image: the imperial power of
Egypt,'' Meyer continues, ``and then we pare away the pieces until
the show isn't about a pyramid but about pure emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Against the scenery's golds and cobalt blues, Broadway costumer
Ann Hould-Ward (``Into the Woods,'' ``Sunday in the Park With
George'') has designed costumes that blend Egyptian motifs with
exotic contemporary styles. She says: ``I want the actors to feel
they could wear these costumes for an evening of dancing or any
stylish event in the city.''
</P>
<P>
   HEATHER HEADLEY
</P>
<P>
   Headley has been living her own personal opera behind the scenes
as she prepares to play Aida. She was thrilled to receive the
legendary role so strongly associated with her idol, Leontyne
Price.
</P>
<P>
   Then Headley read a quote from Price _ ``This is my role'' _ and
for a moment her heart froze.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Uh-oh,''' recalls Headley, with a nervous chuckle.
The slender, regal-voiced performer, who moved with her parents
from Trinidad to the States when she was 14, continues: ``To say I
have a lot to live up to would be the understatement of the year.
Luckily, I have Leontyne's passionate approach to my work: When I
played Nala (girlfriend of ``The Lion King'') on Broadway I was
crying five minutes into the opening night performance, it was such
a powerful experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Headley's heart thawed completely by the time of last month's
rehearsals in New York. As Aida _ the captured Nubian princess in
love with the Egyptian soldier who vanquishes her people _ Headley
is the rock musical lead who must perform closest to the big,
sky-splitting tradition of the Verdi opera. When Headley sang her
heart out, everyone in the company stopped to listen _ and gave her
a huge hand.
</P>
<P>
   Says Alliance chief Kenny Leon in awe: ``I don't know if I've
seen a performer of so many skills at 23.''
</P>
<P>
   Headley, who's single, is such a hot talent that Disney bought
out her contract with the Toronto ``Ragtime'' to cast her in ``The
Lion King.'' She says she's glad to ``lose the cat suit and stop
jumping around breaking my nails. Now I'm on the mission of my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   HANK STRATTON
</P>
<P>
   When Stratton was a high school kid in Long Beach, Calif., he
waited in line all night outside Dodger Stadium to get tickets to
an Elton John concert. He used to lock himself in his bedroom to
sing along with John's ``Madman Across the Water'' at the top of
his lungs, pretending not to hear his mother's desperate pleas for
quiet.
</P>
<P>
   So when he was cast as Radames, the young Egyptian general who
falls in love with Aida, daughter of the enemy king, Stratton's
first response was, ``It's absurd: I'm such an Elton fan how could
I get this job? I've never even sung onstage before _ I had to
audition five times for the role!''
</P>
<P>
   Looking toward heaven, the laughing Stratton adds, ``I am not
worthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta theatergoers would beg to differ. Stratton, who's
single, based in Los Angeles and a product of the London Academy of
Music and Dramatic Art, gave a strong performance as a lawyer
tortuously confused about his sexual identity in the Alliance's
1994 ``Angels in America.'' He calls that production ``a charmed
experience: I have nothing but good things to say about Atlanta.''
After scoring coveted guest spots on TV series (``Northern
Exposure,'' ``Beverly Hills 90210''), Stratton says, ``I was losing
touch with why I wanted to be an actor in the first place, so I
told my agent to find me some good plays. Now I feel like I stood
under the lucky tree.''
</P>
<P>
   SHERIE SCOTT
</P>
<P>
   There was a moving moment at the New York rehearsals when Scott,
playing the spoiled, petulant Egyptian princess Amneris, sang a
solo about her sense of isolation, watching her beloved soldier
Radames fall under the spell of her Nubian servant girl, Aida.
</P>
<P>
   Elton John not only composed the song but served as Scott's
real-life inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't help but think of Elton when I think of Amneris,''
says the 30-ish Kentucky native, who had an ancestor on each side
of the Civil War. ``They're people who were incredibly flamboyant,
perhaps too much into superficiality, then found a deeper meaning
in life. Amneris is the girl who you think has it all _ money,
looks, great clothes _ until you find out something's missing _ and
you can sympathize with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott, who was married a few months ago and appeared in two hit
rock musicals of the '90s _ ``The Who's Tommy'' and ``Rent'' _ is
perched on the armrest of an old movie seat, in the corridor
outside the lower Manhattan rehearsal hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elton's `Greatest Hits' was the first cassette I owned,'' says
the actress, who like her fellow performers will not get to talk to
the rocker at length until previews. ``Recently he's done so much
for people (raising money for AIDS), he's moved beyond being an
entertainer to being a leader. As for Amneris, in the opera she's
just evil, but (the musical) develops her as someone who learns
from Aida's sacrifice, grows into a leader. I think there's a bit
of Elton in Amneris.''

 &HT;    Atlanta theater scene gets a Disney-dose of prestige
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL SEPTEMBER 13: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA_This week, the Intriguing Trio _ Elton, Kenny, Uncle
Walt _ unveil to the world their handiwork: ``Elaborate Lives: The
Legend of Aida.''
</P>
<P>
   From Ansley Park to Central Park West, curious eyes and ears
will be trained on this Broadway-bound pop-rock musical. By
bringing together Kenny Leon's Alliance Theatre Company and Walt
Disney Theatrical Productions, ``Lives'' is one of the first joint
ventures of a nonprofit regional theater and a commercial giant,
with the added wattage of hometown super-rocker Elton John. Come
Thursday, if all goes as planned, the computer-designed pyramid
will spin, the glowing obelisks will rise out of the Alliance stage
and a chorus decked out in dazzling Nile Valley swank will, as the
old song goes, walk like an Egyptian.
</P>
<P>
   And Atlanta's status as the best-kept secret of the American
theater scene will finally come to end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope the show's going to be great,'' Leon said at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hope?'' said Disney exec Tom Schumacher, jokingly
questioning Leon's candor but _ in a subtle way _ offering a
glimpse of the complete control that Disney tries to exert on how
the project is perceived (Alliance staffers have even gotten the
message that they are not to describe the show in public).
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' added Leon, amending his words, ``we have great faith
in the work, but with something new there's always risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the first riddle of the sphinx: Can an
ancient saga of forbidden biracial romance that spawned a humongous
Verdi opera in 1871 also work as a sleek, hip, crowd-pleasing
pop-rock musical in 1998?
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first heard `Aida,' I thought of two things. One:
opera. Two: death. There's a tomb and they die,'' says Sherie
Scott, who as the Egyptian princess Amneris loses the heart of the
soldier Radames to her captured Nubian slave girl, Aida. ``Like
many people I didn't realize the relevance of this story of an
interracial love that took incredible courage. It's one of those
myths that each generation can tell its own way, much as
`Cinderella' (on television recently, with pop star Brandy) was
retold.''
</P>
<P>
   Second riddle of the sphinx: How will audiences respond to a
Disney show that's beyond the threshold of puberty? Amneris is no
Snow White, to say the least, with costumes to make her physical
allure, er, jump out at you. One design element that may even spur
controversy is the Egyptian motif with the chilling look of
fascism. Set designer Stanley Meyer adapts the Egyptian symbol of
the hawk god somewhat as the Nazis did in their architecture and
regalia. There are even symbols reminiscent of swastikas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's intended to be a little disturbing,'' Meyer says, ``but
then this is a story about oppressors and the oppressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Third riddle: Will ``Lives'' continue Disney's golden roll? Will
its first musical created directly for the stage (the first such
project, too, for John) transfer directly to Broadway in early
1999, or will Disney Chairman Michael Eisner send it back to the
drawing board? Even if the show's ready, will a deep-staged (37
feet) theater be available in New York? Will the show follow in the
footsteps of ``Beauty and the Beast,'' laughing at its critics all
the way to the bank? Or will it earn the artistic cachet of John
and Rice's ``The Lion King,'' garnering both raves and riches (not
to mention a few percentage points for the Alliance, too, as the
originating theater?)
</P>
<P>
   Among the curious at the first preview will be Julie Ann
Ferguson, producer of the MasterCard Broadway Series, hungry to see
what could end up as a most lucrative tour in a couple of seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be there to tattle about the show's prospects,'' she
says, chuckling. ``It's not easy to work with (Disney), but
everyone's pleased with their results. `Beauty' gave us our biggest
jump in subscriptions since the British blockbusters of the '80s.
There's no question that Disney's an exciting new force in theater
_ keeping things young and fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   Benefiting, too, from Mouse Power is the Alliance, opening its
30th-anniversary season. Alliance audiences love a good eyeful, and
they've already snatched up most of the tickets for the first half
of the ``Lives'' run. Disney's official line on ``Lives'' is to
stress its story and characters over its visuals, but that looks
like spin for the benefit of New York critics skeptical of glitz.
Although Disney's New York publicist warned an assistant (when he
thought no one was listening), ``Stay away from words like `big'
and `spectacle,''' ``Elaborate Lives'' will in fact be a big
spectacle, judging by set models and descriptions. One person in
the company works only on wigs. Two more focus solely on shoes.
Jewelry has been shipped in from England.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how expensive, and deeply detailed, the stage picture
is,'' says costume shop manager Carol Hammond.
</P>
<P>
   But there's another side to the story. Although she offers no
public complaint, Hammond, who runs one of the finest shops in
regional theater, could feel justifiably insulted by her role in
``Lives,'' which is essentially to take care of the costumes that
Disney's New York shop built from scratch and dropped on her
doorstep. The superb Alliance scene shop is placed in a similar,
limited, noncreative role. In the mostly New York/Los Angeles cast,
there aren't even any chorus members (except for three children)
who have made Atlanta their steady professional base.
</P>
<P>
   So much for ``collaboration.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet the Alliance is being handsomely rewarded for its quiet,
low-ego role as tryout house. The Disney brand is helping to boost
the theater's flat subscription rolls, and all proceeds from the
Atlanta run go into Alliance coffers. With an $8 million budget for
year-round operation on two stages, the Alliance alone could never
afford a single eight-week production that will clearly run into
the millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings up the fourth riddle: How much will this clambake
cost? Disney's Schumacher: ``I never talk about money.'' Fine:
Disney's a private enterprise. But when Alliance managing director
Gus Stuhlreyer declines to discuss finances at all, citing a
confidentiality clause that Disney made him sign, isn't that
another, troubling, matter? Doesn't a resident arts organization,
which benefits from public monies and citizen volunteers, have a
responsibility to be open with its community?
</P>
<P>
   And yet there's no question that, as ``a company that mints
money,'' in the words of producer Alex Hitz, Disney can buy artists
a precious resource: time. Julie Taymor, the brilliant ``Lion
King'' director, said in an interview last spring that the key to
that production was its long, unhurried gestation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with Julie absolutely: Time is the key,'' said Tony
Award-winning costumer Ann Hould-Ward. ``In design, the eye and the
mind are still more important than money. But these producers
understand that the mind needs the time to try different
possibilities and think things through.''
</P>
<P>
   The Alliance gets more than cash, too, in the Disney
partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``It represents a great validation from outside Atlanta,'' says
Alliance board chairman Ann W. Cramer. ``I even get teary about it.
Disney said it was looking for a theater that not only develops
new, quality work but is connected to the heart of its community.
Now, what a wonderful affirmation of the mission that Kenny Leon
has maintained for 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, ``Lives'' rolls toward its Oct. 7 opening, and a
fortune of Tut proportions could ride on the outcome.

   ``You went too near the fire,'' Zoe (Romane Bohringer) tells her
husband, Horty (Olivier Martinez), examining his latest burn from
the furnace at the foundry where he works. Little does she know
that there's a bigger, metaphorical fire that's soon to consume
Horty _ and everyone else in their small French village _ in ``The
Chambermaid.''
</P>
<P>
   If you've seen ``Jamon Jamon,'' one of the few films of Spanish
director J.J. Bigas Luna to get a stateside showing, you'll be
surprised by the tone of his new drama. Whereas ``Jamon'' was a
slapstick tragedy fueled by eruptions of lust, small-town scandals
and the occasional naked bullfight, ``Chambermaid'' takes another
approach to the subject of romantic obsession. It's a beguiling
meditation on desire, loss and, especially, the transformative
power of art in the drab, everyday world.
</P>
<P>
   The year is 1912, and the big news is about a big boat. When
Horty wins the foundry's annual employee race, his prize is a trip
to Southampton, England, where he'll spend the night at a lavish
dockside hotel and watch the ship embark the next day. The ship is
called the Titanic. And this vacation is for only one, which means
Horty has to travel without Zoe.
</P>
<P>
   After checking into his hotel, he's approached by a dazzling
woman named Marie (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon), who works as a
chambermaid on the Titanic. Except that the ship is still being
readied, she doesn't have a place to spend the night, and she hopes
Horty might offer her his room. He doesn't. But he sleeps in a
chair. Or tries to, hyperaware of the beauty in his bed.
</P>
<P>
   Returning home, Horty carries with him a photograph of Marie.
Glimpsing it, his cronies at the local tavern goad him into telling
stories about his night of passion with the chambermaid _ stories
that become even more elaborate and erotic when word of the
Titanic's sinking reaches them. The stories become so persuasive to
Horty and his listeners that it hardly matters that in fact he
never touched Marie. The fiction becomes more powerful than the
reality. (Watching the blue-collar Horty enter this new world of
invention and language carries the same charm as Massimo Troisi's
learning about metaphors and poetry in ``Il Postino.'')
</P>
<P>
   As his storytelling skills usher them into a new life, Zoe finds
herself in a love triangle with a ghost. ``Spray me, like in your
story,'' she begs Horty, referring to his tale of spritzing Marie
with champagne. These champagne fantasies, enacted by Martinez and
Sanchez-Gijon, speckle the movie like nuggets of color in the
otherwise gray-brown palette. In this landscape, love is a thing
that can enrich dull lives but can also infect the soul with a
melancholy appetite that can't be satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   The film's original title, ``The Chambermaid on the Titanic,''
was changed due to audience perception that it was a spoof of the
James Cameron flick. It's not. But the fantasy scenes of Martinez
and Sanchez-Gijon romping in bed inadvertently deconstruct that
Hollywood blockbuster. After all, ``Titanic's'' Harlequin-style
romance between Jack and Rose was no more realistic than the
stories Horty tells his bar pals. But what is idealized love (or a
good movie, for that matter) but the purest form of escapism from
daily drudgery?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chambermaid''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A -
</P>
<P>
   Starring Olivier Martinez, Aitana Sanchez-Gijon and Romane
Bohringer. Directed by J.J. Bigas Luna. In French with English
subtitles. Unrated. One hour, 36 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A haunting movie about the combined powers of love
and art.

 &HT;    COLUMN: A matter of degree: America is leader, loser in mind
power
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL SEPTEMBER 13: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service

<P>
   It's a truism that we never see ourselves the way others see us.
The lenses of self-interest and prejudice always obstruct more
light than they admit, and sometimes they are little more than
mirrors of what we wish to believe. Nowhere is this more true than
in the endless, and endlessly tiring, debates about the state of
American education.
</P>
<P>
   Either we are a nation of dumbbells, with the SAT scores to
prove it, or we are the cerebral cortex of the technological age.
We can't be all one or all the other, and yet evidence can be found
on both sides of the question. At every level, our schools are
nowhere near what they could _ and should _ be. We grandly confer
college degrees upon students who can barely write a paragraph,
cannot solve an equation, could not tell you the causes of World
War I or the consequences of the Treaty of Versailles _ could not,
in fact, locate Versailles on a map.
</P>
<P>
   But everywhere you look we've got gadgets the rest of the world
wants, from Windows 98 to cell phones. And not just gadgets. Our
medical techniques save lives and alleviate suffering. We can't be
too dumb, can we?
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes and no. ``It is an obvious and much commented on
disgrace,'' Alan Ryan writes in ``Liberal Anxieties and Liberal
Education'' (Hill and Wang, $22), ``that American teenagers
perennially score well down in the rankings in international tests
of simple mathematical and linguistic competence, and much lower
than the students of far poorer countries.'' A less obvious
disgrace is that humanities graduates from even our best colleges
``would be hard-pressed to explain simple fallacies of statistical
reasoning and that their colleagues in the sciences and mathematics
would be hard-pressed to explain those fallacies in a paragraph of
clear English prose.''
</P>
<P>
   College a pit stop on road to bucks
</P>
<P>
   This latter characterization comes rather too easily. I can't
help thinking of a friend trained as a civil engineer. English
isn't even her native language, although she speaks it impeccably.
Yet her familiarity with the arts would put nine out of 10 graduate
students in the humanities to shame, none of whom could converse
with her in Farsi.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe she's the rule-proving exception. Maybe the larger point
is the one Ryan makes: that Americans see a college degree in terms
of a future job. For all our pious words about a liberal education,
we want our children to get an MBA or study computer science. You
can be an ignoramus and still make good money.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan is a political philosopher by training and a Briton by
birth. Although now back at Oxford University in England, he taught
at Princeton and other American universities for many years and has
contributed frequently to American periodicals. He comes to us as a
good neighbor, someone who's been to the house often, enjoyed our
company, observed our quarrels and cares about us enough to speak
honestly.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is the tone of Ryan's book _ which originated as a
series of lectures at the University of California at Berkeley _
that makes it persuasive even when you want to take issue with him.
His politics are liberal in the broadest sense _ as you would
expect of a biographer of John Stuart Mill _ but he is hostage to
none of the academy's dogmas du jour.
</P>
<P>
   If conservatives will worry that he is blithely untroubled by
multiculturalism, ideologues on the other side will fault him for
not embracing it with sufficient zeal. ``In his somewhat
flat-footed way,'' Ryan writes, ``(John) Dewey got it right in 1916
in his little essay `Nationalizing Education,' in which he argued
that good hyphens connected while bad hyphens separated.''
</P>
<P>
   Vocational training in higher education
</P>
<P>
   The reply to this might be that the bad hyphens have carried the
day. In most humanities departments, the reigning superstition is
that there can be no common culture, only a collection of tribal
identities rooted in the Holy Trinity (Ryan's term) of class, race
and gender.
</P>
<P>
   None of this escapes Ryan's notice; it just doesn't raise his
blood pressure. The more immediate problem is that ``American
education at every level needs change, and some of the change must
be dramatic.'' Among other things, he questions _ and rightly so _
why the college degree should be obligatory for all and why such
degrees as hotel management should even be conferred. The fact is
that much of what Americans call higher education is ``no more than
remedial secondary education.'' The students enrolled in those
courses have no more business being in college than I have at an
NFL training camp. When the college degree becomes all but
mandatory, it also becomes all but meaningless. You can get one
without taking any mathematics or science, any foreign languages
and virtually no history or literature. What's left?
</P>
<P>
   Let's restore respect for the skilled trades and bring back good
vocational schools for 16- to 19-year-olds who aren't suited for
college, Ryan says. And let's require of students who do go to
college that they know something before they get there, and know a
good deal more by the time they leave. That's not the case now. It
says something when you expect the football team to practice hard
and play hard, but complain that the academic courses are too
demanding.

 &HT;    How Seattle Got Its Concert Hall... and why Atlanta should pay
attention
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL SEPTEMBER 13: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE_Forget about the coffee shops and computers, Kurt and
Courtney. The hot topic blowing from this Northwestern nirvana is
its fine-arts scene. This weekend, Seattle opens its new $118
million symphony hall and, in the process, offers Atlanta _ a city
similar in size, prosperity and ambition _ a lesson in arts
patronage.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, while the Seattle Opera's lavishly praised, $2
million production of Wagner's ``Tristan und Isolde'' set a $1.7
million box office record, the Pacific Northwest Ballet was in
Scotland performing Balanchine's ``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' at
the Edinburgh International Festival. And then there was Seattle
Symphony conductor Gerard Schwarz, directing his Mostly Mozart
festivals in New York and Tokyo and putting finishing touches on
his symphony's new home, Benaroya Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, you may have noticed the maestro, 51, circling the
building in his chocolate-brown Mercedes coupe, checking out every
detail of the elegant glass-and-stone structure. There's a lot to
oversee: an entire city block housing a 2,500-seat auditorium, a
540-seat recital hall, a war memorial and garden, two Starbucks
kiosks and a pair of coiling Medusa chandeliers by Seattle glass
artist Dale Chihuly.
</P>
<P>
   Benaroya Hall seems to have settled into the vibrant downtown
landscape as comfortably as an old Birkenstock sandal. Next door to
the Seattle Art Museum, on University Street, and just three blocks
from the harbor, the building has a four-story curved glass atrium
whose sunny jalousielike windows bring to mind a gigantic beach
house. At the opposite end, etched into the creamy-gray stone
walls, is an Aaron Copland quote that speaks to the higher purpose
of music and people and buildings and things:
</P>
<P>
   ``So long as the human spirit thrives on this planet, music in
some living form will accompany and sustain it and give it
expressive meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   The opening of Benaroya Hall promises to be a fanfare for the
common man _ and the great patron.
</P>
<P>
   It's a triumphant moment for Schwarz, who's finally made good on
his 12-year quest to liberate the orchestra from the acoustically
dead, 3,000-seat Seattle Center Opera House, where the opera,
ballet and symphony have shared the same stage for the last
quarter-century. It's a sweet moment for Jack Benaroya, the quietly
powerful 77-year-old Seattle real estate tycoon and good friend of
Schwarz's who handed out the $15 million gift that got the city's
philanthropic juices flowing. It's also the moment of truth for the
architects and the acoustician, especially since Schwarz and
company are already comparing the auditorium to Boston's Symphony
Hall and Amsterdam's Concertgebouw.
</P>
<P>
   For Atlanta especially, the story of how Seattle got its hall _
on time and on budget _ is worth examining.
</P>
<P>
   While Los Angeles' Walt Disney Concert Hall had a $50 million
gift from the Disney family, that hall has been stuck since 1994 in
a quagmire of cost overruns; the $255 Frank Gehry design is now
scheduled to break ground in April, with an opening date of October
2002.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't have to look to the West Coast for signs of how
arts patrons can work in partnership with public funders. On
Thursday, ground was broken in Columbus, Ga., for the $60 million
RiverCenter for the Performing Arts, which is being funded by a $35
million gift from the Bradley-Turner Foundation, $17 million from
the state and $28 million in private gifts. RiverCenter is to
include a 2,000-seat auditorium for the Columbus Symphony, a
450-seat recital hall and a 150-seat black-box theater.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, on the other hand, is a city in need of a patron.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of talk about a hall this or a hall that,
and I'm suggesting that I am putting that on hold until somebody
comes forward and says they want to do something,'' says Atlanta
Symphony Orchestra board chairman A.D. Frazier Jr. ``I have no
contact with anyone. There is nothing on the horizon. Would we
consider it if someone wanted to step forward and give us one?
Sure.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some interesting parallels between the ASO and the
Seattle Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   The ASO started its 1995 season with a $2.9 million accumulated
deficit. It later received a $5 million challenge grant from an
anonymous donor and paid off the debt. Today its books are
balanced, and its share of the Woodruff Arts Center endowment is
$48 million. Frazier says the board has raised $22.6 million of its
$40 million endowment campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Symphony started its 1993 season with a $3.2 million
deficit on an $8.6 million budget. In 1991, King County citizens
voted against a levy that would have provided $29 million for a new
hall across the street from the opera house at Seattle Center. The
symphony's credibility, and its credit, were shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were sinking in the mud in debt,'' says Ron Woodard,
symphony board chairman and president of Boeing Co. He had just
joined the board. Almost immediately, he loaned a Boeing executive
to help the orchestra balance its books. The hall issue quieted
somewhat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really all over the map and was a failure and wasn't
going to happen,'' says symphony executive director Deborah Card.
``There wasn't a whole lot of excitement about giving to the
symphony because we were not the popular game in town. We'd always
been struggling with deficits and problems, and nobody would have
guessed that we would have been able to do this successfully.''
</P>
<P>
   What the symphony needed was a patron. And on May 5, 1993, the
Benaroya bombshell struck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a personal gift to Gerry Schwarz,'' says
Speight Jenkins, Seattle Opera general director and a close friend
of Schwarz's. ``It's the connection they had with Gerry and their
belief in Gerry as a conductor that got the money here, which I
think is absolutely proper, because Gerry is a wonderful conductor
and he is the kind of person that can inspire that.''
</P>
<P>
   At 77, Jack Benaroya is revered in the community as a generous
benefactor. He is intensely private and doesn't like to talk about
his giving. But one of the causes closest to his heart is juvenile
diabetes _ his grandson suffers from it.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning he's to give a short speech to a group of patrons
who gave in the $10,000-$24,000 range, he arrives at the hall in an
expensive gray pinstripe suit. On his white cuffs, his name is
embroidered in bold: Jack. Like the Copland quote _ an added
expense that he paid for _ he speaks solemnly and with a sense of
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Alabama to Jewish immigrants (his father was from
Bulgaria, his mother from Rhodes), he says his parents headed to
California when he was 3 or 4 weeks old; later, they moved to
Washington state. ``I cry with a Southern accent,'' he jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Benaroya and numerous others interviewed for this article say
that Schwarz did not go begging. Benaroya says he kept reading
about the symphony's need for a better hall in the newspaper, and
after the third time, he gave Schwarz a call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him what it would take to get the show on the road,
and I asked him if $10 (million) or $15 million would get it
started. And he said, yes, he thought that 15 could get it started.
Then I talked to the family and decided that this was what we would
do, that this would be our gift to the city. Nobody asked me to do
this. Gerry and I were friends. I didn't want to put my name on it,
and I didn't feel it was necessary. The important thing was to get
a gift going.''
</P>
<P>
   It worked.
</P>
<P>
   Eight days later, Boeing Co. donated $3 million to the capital
campaign. Woodard says he'd been working behind the scenes to make
it happen. Today the capital campaign has raised $80 million for
the building and endowment funds, with 18 gifts of $1 million or
more and some 300 donations in excess of $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack was the beginning, not the end,'' says Schwarz. ``It
encouraged a lot of people to come forward, and the numbers became
quite large.''
</P>
<P>
   In the push to put the hall downtown, the Seattle City Council
committed $41 million to the project in March 1995. The original
plans to build across from the opera house _ at the park north of
downtown built for the 1962 World's Fair _ were abandoned. ``We've
had the advantage of being able to look at older cities and see
what happened,'' says Council member Jan Drago. ``We knew we only
had a short window of time to turn downtown around, and the arts
were a major piece of that.''
</P>
<P>
   At a recent donors luncheon in the Benaroya Hall lobby, patrons
munched on salmon while symphony musicians played chamber music.
There was a round of speeches, and one by one, everyone hailed
Benaroya. ``What had been literally and figuratively one of the
darkest holes of downtown Seattle has become one of his brightest
spots,'' Drago said.
</P>
<P>
   Comparing Seattle and Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   To understand the nature of arts patronage in Seattle _ and
relate it to Atlanta _ it's good to know something about the two
cities' demographics and their sense of style.
</P>
<P>
   Though the cities are a continent apart, they are almost
demographic twins: similar in physical size and metro population
(both near 3.5 million). Both have wildly successful economies and
verdant landscapes that are green with money both old and new.
Seattle's got Boeing and Microsoft; Atlanta has Coca-Cola and Home
Depot.
</P>
<P>
   In a fascinating ``Who We Are'' essay in The Seattle Times last
year, writer Hugo Kugiya said: ``What we are becoming _ gay (or at
least more openly so), Asian, angst-ridden, insomniacs, Rhodes
scholars, Saab drivers _ seems to have little do with what we were
_ Scandinavian, cautious, pious, in bed by 10 p.m.''
</P>
<P>
   Change ``Scandinavian'' to ``Anglo,'' and you could be talking
about Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But do Atlantans give as much?
</P>
<P>
   In a recent Atlanta-Journal Constitution survey, 196 metro
business leaders were asked to grade Atlanta's arts patrons,
compared to those in other cities. The results: 10 percent gave
Atlanta patrons an A, 41 percent gave them a B, and 39 percent gave
them a C.
</P>
<P>
   No one can say exactly how much private money is given to the
arts in each city. What can be addressed is the mood of giving _ or
general giving. An example: Atlanta has 18 individuals who give
$100,000 or more to the United Way; Seattle has 12. In the
$25,000-$100,000 range, Atlanta has 18, compared to 111 in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Says Woodruff Arts Center executive vice president Beauchamp C.
Carr, ``It boils down to, do people want to give? Do they
understand how important music can be in the lives of your city's
citizens? I believe in Atlanta we have a strong base of people who
are very generous, and who do understand that, and yet we have a
long way to go _ especially if we are going to build a world-class
concert hall like Seattle or Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Garrepy, a former fund-raiser at the Atlanta Ballet who's
manager of corporate relations for the Seattle Opera, says, ``The
real difference in these two cities in terms of arts philanthropy
is individual giving. We have major donors in both cities,
obviously. But what is really striking about Seattle is that it's
not just major donors. It's the everyday people who also feel a
responsibility to give. So you find people in their 20s and 30s
giving in the $100 range.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Seattle Symphony's capital campaign clearly tried to
get all the big money it could, it encouraged ownership from
throughout the community. ``There isn't a hierarchy or some sort of
class system that says, `You fit in but you don't, just because you
have more money than you do or you have an old family name,''' says
Card.
</P>
<P>
   But old family names, and their foundations, do build monumental
public buildings. Look at Benaroya Hall, Carnegie Hall in New York
or the Woodruff Arts Center in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Opera's Jenkins, a member of the National Arts
Council, has a theory on giving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who's ever worked in the arts for more than a week
knows that new money is harder to get than old money,'' says
Jenkins, a fast-talking Texan who runs one of Seattle's big-three
arts groups, with a budget of $13.7 million. ``New-money people
haven't grasped the idea that they can give to an arts
organization, or they can give to a hospital. They don't have to
give it to the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates, whom one might put in the
category of very big new money, donated $2 million to the
symphony's capital campaign, while the Nordstrom department store
family foundation gave $7.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rich people in Seattle wear Eddie Bauer parkas and drive
Ford Explorers and don't like a lot of fuss,'' says Melinda
Bargreen, The Seattle Times classical music critic, who has covered
the scene for more than 20 years. ``They prefer to give in a
low-key manner. This is kind of a low-key region in a lot of
respects. You look at style and fashion, and it's not a place where
you see a lot of flamboyance. There's not a lot of big hair and
fur.''
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, old money is quirky.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Seattle communications heiress Priscilla Bullitt
Collins. In 1994, she and her sister, Harriet Stimson Bullitt,
transferred ownership of classical music station KING-FM to the
Seattle Symphony, the Seattle Opera and Seattle's Corporate Council
for the Arts. In a situation that is unique in this country, the
commercial station's profits are used to support the three arts
organizations. Collins also spearheaded the effort to move the
county's war memorial to a Garden of Remembrance outside the hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``She in a lot of ways sets the tone for individual philanthropy
in this town,'' says Garrepy. ``She's the quiet power. She's
quintessentially Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   If Atlanta is to get a new symphony hall, it could use a patron
such as Benaroya or Priscilla Bullitt Collins.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it's a tragedy that the great city of the South is not
considered on the artistic level that it should be,'' says Jenkins,
shaking his head. ``This is outrageous.''

 &HT;    GORE FILLING POLITICAL VOID AS PRESIDENT BATTLES IMPEACHMENT
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore is stepping into the
political void as a campaign surrogate for President Clinton, who
is increasingly viewed as a curse by Democrats seeking election to
Congress this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's his mission,'' Colorado Gov. Roy Roemer, general
chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said of Gore
following the vice president's partisan address Thursday to the
Democratic Business Council, a small but influential organization
of business men and women in the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, added Roemer, that may be Gore's only mission in the
coming weeks as Congress considers whether evidence submitted by
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr concerning Clinton's relationship
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky warrants the
impeachment of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Gore ``has no role in that,'' Roemer said, referring to the
anticipated confrontation between Clinton and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Lewinsky scandal began last January _ and
especially since the president's nationally televised address
acknowledging having misled the nation about the nature of his
relationship with Lewinsky _ Gore has all but ignored the political
ramifications of his friend's predicament, at least in public.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Gore has spent time this summer actively
promoting Democratic candidates for Congress this fall. In doing
so, he is advancing his own campaign for the Democratic Party's
presidential nomination in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been working hard for the party all year,'' said
Democratic Business Council Chairman Tom Hendrickson, a Raleigh,
N.C., businessman and longtime friend of Gore. ``The only
difference is that now, with the president involved in other
matters, he's getting a lot more attention from the media.''
</P>
<P>
   However, with Democratic congressional candidates increasingly
concerned about appearing in public with Clinton, Gore appears
ready for an expanded dual role in the fall election: promoting
Democratic policies and defending the president.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's speech to the Democratic Business Council was a sample of
what might be expected in the coming weeks as Gore travels around
the country on behalf of Democratic congressional candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly assailing the Republican leadership of Congress for
``risky schemes'' of tax cuts and changes in Social Security, Gore
urged his fellow party members to unite behind the administration's
efforts to improve education and health care and to continue the
economic expansion that began in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the economic accomplishments of the past six years,
including the lowest jobless rates and inflation rates in decades,
Gore said, ``There is one person who stands at the heart of all
that progress, and that is President Bill Clinton. His leadership
is shaping all aspects of this nation's recovery. He is my friend,
and he is our president, and his policies have been manifestly good
for the United States of America.''
</P>
<P>
   His comments sparked enthusiastic applause for the president
from the partisan Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``Battleground 98'' poll released this week by
Republican Ed Goeas and Democratic Celinda Lake suggest that the
White House scandal has pushed moral values to the top of the
voters' agenda, threatening to depress Democratic turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, Gore parted with this advice to his fellow
Democrats: ``Early to bed, early to rise, work like hell and
organize.''

 &HT;    `Rounders' has as many good faces as a royal flush
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Director John Dahl has dealt himself a winning hand wth his
nifty new poker movie, ``Rounders.'' That's partly due to the
pungent, poker-wise script by Brian Koppelman and David Levien. It
also helps that Dahl has two very hot aces up his sleeve: Matt
Damon and Edward Norton.
</P>
<P>
   Dahl and his excellent cast _ there's also John Turturro as
wise, sad-eyed poker veteran Joey Knish and Martin Landau as a law
professor _ draw us into this unique milieu of tells, flushes, cold
decks and No Limit Texas Hold 'Em as easily as the seasoned pros
sucker-play the tourists in Atlantic City. As Damon's Mike
McDermott tells us early on, ``If you can't spot the sucker in your
first half-hour at the table, then you are the sucker.''
</P>
<P>
   McDermott is a law student with a knack for cards. But he's gone
cold turkey since the night he lost his tuition money, his
self-respect and, it's hinted, his nerve in a big-stakes game
against a notorious Russian heavy hitter, Teddy KGB (John
Malkovich).
</P>
<P>
   Nine months later, Mike still hasn't touched a card, though the
sound of a shuffling deck can make him fidget like Ray Milland in
``The Lost Weekend.'' So he avoids the old joints and sticks to
school and his girlfriend, Jo (Gretchen Mol.)
</P>
<P>
   Trouble comes when pal Worm (Norton) gets out of jail. Soon,
Mike's got the itch. Bad. Not for himself, of course, but to help
the debt-ridden Worm, a guy who never knew how to quit when he was
ahead. And who's been ahead maybe once in a blue moon.
</P>
<P>
   The neat thing about ``Round-
</P>
<P>
   ers'' is that it doesn't need to play us for suckers. Dahl and
company may play us, but they're on the level. Their movie is
smart, self-aware, rich in characters. The gambling life certainly
doesn't look glamorous _ ``You don't gamble,'' says Mike, ``you
grind it out'' _ but it's not just a glorified con game either.
</P>
<P>
   Poker, like life, isn't about luck; it's about people skills.
``The key to the game,'' according to Mike, ``is play the man, not
the cards.'' The movie's irony is that he forgets to do that when
it comes to Worm.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Dahl, who entranced us with ``The Last Seduction,''
plays the characters, not the plot. That it all leads to a final
rematch with Teddy KGB isn't surprising; how we get back to that
table _ and at what cost _ is.
</P>
<P>
   Landau and Turturro provide different but equally valid moral
compasses in their complementary roles. Malkovich does less scenery
chewing than usual as the man who can alter Mike's life with the
flick of a card.
</P>
<P>
   But the picture has been dealt directly to its two stars.
Norton, who calls to mind Robert De Niro's Johnny Boy in ``Mean
Streets,'' makes a most convincing loose cannon. Shifty, cocky and
untrustworthy, he nonetheless plays Mike like a master.
</P>
<P>
   Damon has the harder role: the conflicted good guy who finds a
way to wrest redemption from addiction. The actor has a wonderful
quality _ a golden-boy likability, whether he's tossing off a
wise-guy crack or trying a blatant stalling tactic. His charm is
dangerous to himself as much as to others. When he sidles up to a
game, be it in Landau's paneled den or some garish corner of
Atlantic City, he makes you feel like you've walked in with a
winner. And that, ladies and gents, is what star power is all
about.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    `Let's Talk About Sex': Don't ask, don't tell
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Jerry Springer, Henry Jaglom, a brain-dead Howard Stern
wannabe and the folks who dreamed up ``The Love Connection'' ever
collaborated on a movie, it might look a lot like ``Let's Talk
About Sex.'' Unfortunately, the film is actually the creation of
Troy Beyer _ an appealing actress who, like everyone else in
Hollywood, apparently really wants to direct. And write. Before she
tries it again, perhaps she should be locked up for a week in a
room with Don Simpson's corpse. She's estrogen's answer to the late
producer's lucrative but cretinous brand of testos-
</P>
<P>
   terone-surge cinema (``Con Air,'' ``The Rock'').
</P>
<P>
   Shot in Miami, ``Let's Talk About Sex'' starts out as merely a
wrongheaded irritation, then turns into one of the most
unintentionally hilarious movies this side of ``Showgirls.'' Jazz
(Breyer), an advice columnist for a Miami paper, wants to produce
and star in her own talk show, about dating in the 1990s from a
female perspective. As far as I could tell, the show's ``concept''
consists of getting uninhibited females to talk dirty to the
camera. There are, however, occasional action scenes: One woman
pulls a condom over her head; another gives a vigorous exhibition
of sex-on-top while straddling a chair.
</P>
<P>
   Jazz coerces her roomies, open-hearted Lena (Randi Ingerman) and
hardhearted Michelle (Paget Brewster), into helping her tape her
pilot. In doing so they learn a little about lots of other young
women and _ gasp! _ lots about themselves. Each, it seems, has her
own secret ache. Michelle's mother doesn't love her. Jazz broke off
her engagement because she can't have children. Lena's boyfriend
always leaves right after sex.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure there are moviegoers out there who are shallow enough,
lonely enough or desperate enough to identify with this film. There
always have been. Think of such '50s and early-'60 staples as
``Where the Boys Are'' and ``Three Coins in the Fountain.'' But the
love seekers in ``Let's Talk About Sex'' mirror their film's title;
they have a harsher '90s edge that makes them less pleasant company
than their earlier counterparts. I guess terminal perkiness wears
better than predatory calculation.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder these three usually go home alone from a party.
They're not losers; they're just pathetically generic and
myopically man-hungry. By the time a choked-up Michelle lets loose
a primal wail, ``When does the pain go away????'' I was totally
verklempt. But ``Seinfeld'' fans take note: There's a cat fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's Talk About Sex''

 &HT;    `Simon Birch': Large heart, but scant depth
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Simon Birch,'' a nostalgic drama about a courageous
12-year-old dwarf, is clearly a labor of love. After all, the
marketing demographics on tear-jerkers about courageous 12-year-old
dwarfs can't be all that encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, like most labors of love _ Barry Levinson's ``Toys''
springs to mind _ this one is a labor to sit through.
</P>
<P>
   Diminutive Simon Birch (Ian Michael Smith), the tiniest baby
ever born in the picturesque Maine resort that provides the film's
setting, may be a little guy, but he deeply believes God has big
plans for him. That's what he keeps telling his best pal, Joe
(Joseph Mazzello) _ that he will one day be a hero.
</P>
<P>
   But Joe has problems of his own. Specifically, his luscious mom
(Ashley Judd), scion of a wealthy family, got pregnant with him in
high school and has never revealed the father's identity. Let's
see. Could it be the guy with about eight lines of dialogue, or
could it be the handsome, tortured local minister (David
Strathairn)? The only other significant male presence in the movie
is Oliver Platt, gamely trying to inject life into his scenes as
Judd's new beau.
</P>
<P>
   Told in a vignette-ish style with voice-over narration by Jim
Carrey as the grown-up Joe, the movie strives for the bittersweet
yet comic tone of ``The Wonder Years.'' What it manages is a not
very good episode of Fred Savage's finest hour, with the 1950s and
early '60s replacing that series' '70s setting (one plus: Judd
looks fresh and sexy in her period wardrobe).
</P>
<P>
   All these negatives aren't meant to take anything away from
young Ian, who suffers from a rare enzyme disorder called Morquio's
syndrome. He appears to be a courageous kid off-screen as much as
on, and he handles his role as well as possible under the
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie simply doesn't work. Jan Hooks (``Saturday Night
Live'') and Dana Ivey (``Driving Miss Daisy'' onstage), two fine
actors who happen to be former Georgia girls, are wasted as a
cartoonish spinster teacher and a society matron, respectively. And
Carrey, who must owe writer-turned-director Mark Steven Johnson big
time, makes an ill-advised bookend cameo that contributes little to
the film other than giving ``Entertainment Tonight'' a misleading
clip to air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simon Birch'' is loosely based on (the credits say ``suggested
by'') John Irving's ''A Prayer for Owen Meany.'' Apparently, more
than the title character's name was changed, and Irving has
distanced himself from the project. He's trying to tell you
something. Pay attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simon Birch''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: D-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ian Michael Smith and Joseph Mazzello. Directed by Mark
Steven Johnson. Rated PG for violence (a scary bus accident) and
sexual innuendo. At metro theaters. 1 hour, 50 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A little movie with big problems.

 &HT;    `Single Girl' finds excitement in mundane
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``A Single Girl'' is as simple and penetrating as its title.
</P>
<P>
   Working in real time _ a trick most famously pulled in ``High
Noon''_ Benoit Jacquot's movie charts a random but crucial morning
in the life of a young Parisian. Over breakfast, 19-year-old
Valerie (Virginie Ledoyen) tells her boyfriend (Benoit Magimel)
that she's pregnant. Before anything can be resolved _ you can tell
by his face he's not overjoyed and by her face that his expression
hasn't gone unnoticed _ she rushes off to a nearby posh hotel. This
day is also, we learn, her first day at her new job as a
room-service attendant.
</P>
<P>
   Jacquot's camera follows Valerie everywhere. Meeting with her
new co-workers, some of whom are friendlier than others. Sparring
with the personnel manager during the requisite
welcome-to-our-little-family/don't-cross-me speech. Stealing a
smoke between encounters with the guests, some more bizarre than
others.
</P>
<P>
   As Stanley Kubrick did in ''The Shining,'' Jacquot sends his
camera gliding down long, deserted hotel corridors. Sometimes the
only sounds we hear are the click of Valerie's heels or the slight
squeak of her room-service cart. She's not exactly the type to
whistle while she works.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is also an oblique comment on physical beauty. Valerie
isn't just pretty; she's stunning, even with her hair carelessly
pulled back and dressed in her unflatteringly androgynous hotel
uniform. Yet her looks invite hostility as often as they do
approval. The reactions have almost nothing to do with anything
beyond the delicate curve of her neck or the perfection of her
cheekbones. Who she really is doesn't seem to matter _ not to her
bosses, her colleagues, the guests, her boyfriend, possibly not
even to herself (the last will change over the course of the
morning).
</P>
<P>
   Ledoyen is right on the money as this prickly, cryptic
victim-provocateur. She combines a reserved teenage toughness with
a seductive, no-bull radiance.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, Jean-Luc Godard complained at the New York Film
Festival that movies never show people at work. Unless, that is,
they're cops, combat journalists, union organizers or hit men. ''A
Single Girl'' does, with a compulsive integrity that's fascinating.
The film is both mundane and exciting, predictable and unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Single Girl''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A -
</P>
<P>
   Starring Virginie Ledoyen. Directed by Benoit Jacquot. Not
rated, but contains vulgarity and nudity. Subtitles. 1 hour, 30
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A singularly compelling film.

`TESS' GIVES EMMY SHOW SOME COMPETITION 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's considered appalling manners to put anything good on
opposite the annual prime-time Emmy Awards, when television
celebrates itself.
</P>
<P>
   The Emmys are this Sunday on NBC. The WB may fairly be absolved
of guilt for premiering ``The Army Show'' against the awards. It
isn't good enough to count as competition.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;E has no such excuse for starting the two-part miniseries
``Tess of the D'Urbervilles'' on Sunday. And PBS probably should
have thought twice about scheduling the beginning of a two-part
documentary, ``The U.S.-Mexican War'' on Emmy night. Bad form, old
chaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tess,'' which concludes Monday, is the bigger shame because
it's the better show. The A&AMP;E and London Weekend Television
co-production of Thomas Hardy's 1891 novel stars the stunningly
attractive and generously gifted Justine Waddell in the title role.
</P>
<P>
   Waddell is a South African, 22 years old, and still a student at
Cambridge. She has a mercurial face that seems to possess its own
subtle metabolism, and a barely corseted sensuality that's
surprisingly rare among English-speaking actresses.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy toyed with the influence of fate in ``Tess of the
D'Urbervilles.'' The word crops up from time to time in the story
of a low-born beauty, Tess Durbeyfield, who is loved and betrayed
by two men _ her putative cousin Alec D'Urberville (Jason Flemyng)
and her overly virtuous husband, Angel Clare (Oliver Milburn).
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who's read the book, or seen Roman Polanski's 1980 film
version, won't expect a blissful ending. ``Tess'' gives us a tragic
heroine and assails her with grime, evil portents and plain bad
luck.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Sharp directs this version with a sort of supercharged sense
of impending doom, along with heightened passion. Even Angel Clare,
a character often dismissed as bloodless by literary critics,
exhibits genuine passion.
</P>
<P>
   As with other recent literary adaptations from England, ``Tess''
is eye-poppingly beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the serenity of Jane Austen's day, life may have
been in a roil by Hardy's time. But the rolling greenery of Dorset
and the placid pond water reflection of the D'Urberville manor are
gorgeous.
</P>
<P>
   When Tess turns to stoop labor as a field worker, the miniseries
seems to turn for pictorial inspiration to the French painter
Jean-Francois Millet and his quietly disturbing scenes of rustic
labor.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   _ ``The U.S.-Mexican War'' (airing Sunday and Monday), a
production of Dallas' PBS station, KERA, presents a slice of
American history that's as uninviting as it is important.
</P>
<P>
   The war, from 1846 to 1848, wasn't a particularly savory affair.
Ulysses Grant, who fought in it, would later write in his memoirs
that ``I regard the war as one of the most unjust ever waged by a
stronger against a weaker nation.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, you could be reading this newspaper in
espanol if an aggressively expansive President James Polk hadn't
secured the annexation of Texas and, by force of arms, forced
Mexico to relinquish California and the New Mexico territory.
</P>
<P>
   It could be that the Mexican-American War has gotten the
documentary it deserves _ stiff, uninvolving and unwilling to
exploit its few assets.
</P>
<P>
   Those assets include several fascinating personalities. Polk.
Grant. Robert E. Lee. Henry David Thoreau. John Fremont. Winfield
Scott. Zachary Taylor. The men of the San Patricios Battalion,
mostly Irish Catholic immigrants who turned traitor and fought for
the Mexicans. And Mexico's man on horseback, Antonio Lopez de Santa
Anna, villainized by Americans for the Alamo siege.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary seems loath to stray from its chronological
railings to explore those personalities with any depth or
enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   It's a mistake, and it's a major reason ``The U.S.-Mexican War''
is, overall, a dry, colorless and odorless yawn.
</P>
<P>
   _ New network series? Yeah, we've got a few of those. Fox's
``Living in Captivity'' (airing Friday) is one of two new shows _
ABC's ``The Hughleys'' is the other _ about black families moving
into white suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it's what Diane English, the creator of ``Living in
Captivity'' (and ``Murphy Brown'' before it) imagines it would be
like for a black radio personality (Dondre T. Whitfield) and his
wife (Kira Arne) to move into a quiet gated community.
</P>
<P>
   Their next-door neighbor, ``Muffler King'' Carmine Santucci
(Lenny Venito), is allotted most of the laughs in a latter-day
Archie Bunker role.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of viewers all across the country will find it amusing to
hear gags like this, spoken at a neighborhood store: ``So, this
whole place is just filled with white people, huh? Well, I guess
that explains the five-gallon jars of Miracle Whip!''
</P>
<P>
   White people ... Miracle Whip. Nudge, nudge. Oh, never mind.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Living in Captivity'' is classic comedy compared with
``The Army Show.'' Essentially it's an office comedy set at an Army
base that was supposed to have been closed in 1974. But thanks to
Pentagon ineptitude, the backwater base is still in playful
operation.
</P>
<P>
   You should approach this show cautiously, with a walking stick,
and give it a hard poke before deciding to watch it. When it fails
to respond to the poke, you'll understand. It's dead. Call animal
disposal.

   SCI-ECOLI-CATTLE (Undated) _ Microbiologists at Cornell have
found a way to virtually rid cattle of harmful strains of E. coli
bacteria, among them the bacteria that have caused scores of deaths
and sickened thousands who ate undercooked hamburgers. Their
studies, described in today's issue of the journal Science,
demonstrated that the grain-based feedlot diet usually fed to
cattle before slaughter fosters the growth of E. coli bacteria.
They found that if cattle are switched to a diet of hay or fresh
grass for just five days before slaughter, the possibility of
infection could be greatly reduced. By Jane E. Brody.

`SIMON BIRCH' GIVES IRVING NOVEL SHORT SHRIFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MELISSA MORRISON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Little Simon Birch is a kid with a cruel lot: He was
born a dwarfish size, his tiny body gnarled.
</P>
<P>
   His parents regard him as an inconvenience, when they regard him
at all. His fellow schoolboys in his provincial New England
hometown taunt him, and most of the grown-ups treat him like a
freak.
</P>
<P>
   Simon shoulders it all, certain that God has made him this way
for a purpose that eventually will reveal itself, and make him a
hero in the process. His faith, in other words, sustains him.
</P>
<P>
   Readers of the John Irving novel ``A Prayer for Owen Meany''
will recognize Simon as the title character despite the name
change. They will also recognize, in this film version, the Irving
equation of humor plus tragedy equals pathos.
</P>
<P>
   But what works on the page doesn't necessarily translate to the
screen. Irving's Owen is a preternaturally self-possessed boy;
cinematic Simon comes across as just another unrealistically
adultlike kid. Owen's unusual speech is conveyed in capital
letters; Simon just has a high, inexpressive pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The role of Simon had to be among the hardest in film history to
convincingly cast _ up there with Lolita, the transvestite in ``The
Crying Game,'' or anyone who plays Woody Allen's love interest. The
pool of exceptionally tiny kids who can act has got to be a shallow
one.
</P>
<P>
   In Ian Michael Smith, director-writer Mark Steven Johnson (the
``Grumpy Old Men'' movies) came close. The towheaded 11-year-old is
cute, but it's hard not to feel that the filmmakers expected that
to compensate for his limited vocal range and emotive abilities.
</P>
<P>
   Not to lay all the blame at the feet of Smith. He plays a
12-year-old boy who has to convincingly make pronouncements such as
``Faith is not in a floor plan.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the performance of Joseph Mazzello (``Jurassic
Park,'' ``Star Kid'') is gratifyingly solid. Mazzello plays Joe,
Simon's best friend and the person through whose eyes Simon's story
is seen. Joe's a fellow outcast, thanks to being the bastard son of
the town beauty, Rebecca (a glowing Ashley Judd). The movie
concerns the boys' dual quest: Simon's for his life's purpose and
Joe's for his father's identity.
</P>
<P>
   The other characters in ``Simon Birch'' are made flesh and blood
by the likes of Jan Hooks (as a thin-lipped Sunday school teacher),
David Strathairn (a preacher) and Oliver Platt (a kindly drama
teacher).
</P>
<P>
   Jim Carrey appears in a cameo as grown-up Joe. His post-``Truman
Show'' presence echoes the movie's attempted sensibility: the wacky
with the sober. But he does little here other than provide a warm
presence and some sonorous narration.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard enough to make an emotionally compelling movie, but
making one from a widely loved book is usually thankless. (I wasn't
crazy about ``A Prayer for Owen Meany,'' but friends profess a
heartfelt devotion.) The 1982 adaptation of ``The World According
to Garp'' was a rare one that beat the odds, successfully capturing
Irving's patented quirks without turning the movie into a freak
show.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Simon Birch'' credits say the screenplay was ``suggested
by'' the book, rather than the usual ``adapted from.'' The movie
telescopes the events of its two main characters' lives to a single
year, and key elements of the book, including a climax set at
Phoenix's Sky Harbor Airport, are changed for some that are less
than divinely inspired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simon Birch'' is rated PG for some profanity and situations
that may disturb children. 2 stars. &QL;

<P>
   TV-MCBEAL (Undated) _ Since imitation is synonymous with
creativity in the TV industry, expect a lot more homages to ``Ally
McBeal.'' To help in the development process, we dutifully suggest
the following treatments, which could be ready for air in a season
or two. Or maybe even next week.
</P>
<P>
   By John Levesque. (story will move in the ``e'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   TV-CAPTIVITY (Undated) _ Making people think while they laugh is
the highest form of comedy. And the hardest. ``Living in
Captivity'' does it poorly, at least in the first three episodes.
Blame it on an unconvincing cast filled with the usual stereotypes
and on scripted situations that are designed to make us recognize
our own biases but that don't ring true.
</P>
<P>
   By John Levesque. (story will move in the ``e'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-ROUNDERS (Undated) _ The title characters of John Dahl's
highly derivative but hard-to-resist gambling drama, ``Rounders,''
are a pair of high-stakes, Manhattan poker hustlers _ Matt Damon as
a young law student so gifted at figuring player psychology that he
can practically read minds, and his best friend, Edward Norton, who
is gutsy but considerably less talented.
</P>
<P>
   By William Arnold. (Story will move in the ``e'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-BESTMAN (Undated) _ Noted Italian director Pupi Avati's new
film, ``The Best Man'' (``Il Testimone dello Sposo''), is a highly
enjoyable historical romance that develops out of an abortive
wedding in a small Northern Italian town on the last day of the
19th century.
</P>
<P>
   By William Arnold. (Story will move in the ``e'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-CAB (Undated) ``Chicago Cab,'' which is based on Will
Kern's long-running play, ``Hellcab,'' makes the leap from live
theater to the big screen with both awkwardness and grace.
Featuring guest appearances by Gillian Anderson, John Cusack and
Julianne Moore, the film is a Chicago-born and bred enterprise all
the way. It features a couple of Steppenwolf Theatre's founding
performers _ Laurie Metcalf and Moira Harris _ and even Windy City
native Cusack takes on dual hats: he not only acts but is the
film's executive producer.
</P>
<P>
   By Paula Nechak. (Story will move in the ``e'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-SIMON (Undated) _ Disney's heart-warming wannabe, ``Simon
Birch,'' is ``suggested by'' (whatever that means) a novel by John
Irving, and has a few flashes of the author's inspired sense of the
absurd. But not many, and the film is, mostly, agonizingly bad.
</P>
<P>
   By William Arnold. (Story will move in the ``e'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-SEXTALK (Undated) _ ``Let's Talk About Sex'' is a vacuous,
air-headed treatise about women's secret lives, wants and desires.
It's based on high school dreams of a perfect guy with a perfect
body who will make everything better. Even in a crisis, seemingly
intelligent, beautiful women resort to cleaning, eating and crying
while waiting for the phone to ring.

 &HT;    BRITISH FANS BOO MURDOCH BID FOR MANCHESTER UNITED
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOMSHALL, England _ A London newspaper portrayed Rupert Murdoch
the other day as the devil, and for many people here the paper had
it right.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the devil may have found a warmer welcome Thursday at
The Compasses Inn in this ivy-covered village 45 minutes south of
London. Here the Australian-born media mogul is seen as a threat to
something as cherished in this culture as the pints of bitters
clutched by the after-work crowd here.
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch seeks to purchase Manchester United, the 120-year-old
soccer club that means as much or more to people here as baseball's
New York Yankees or basketball's Boston's Celtics mean to
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wrong and it shouldn't be allowed,'' said Mike Luxon, a
retiree standing at the bar with a few friends, who energetically
expressed their support for his views in terms not suitable for a
family newspaper. ``Once it starts there, where does it stop?''
</P>
<P>
   Luxon's concerns echo those thrashing through radio talk shows
and letters to the editor columns across Britain. Essentially,
people worry that when the owner of a dominant satellite pay TV
channel, BSkyB, buys the nation's dominant sports franchise, it
will be a matter of time before ordinary fans will have to pay a
fee to see what they now watch for free. They also fear the team
will be molded for TV viewers _ perhaps switched to some super
European league _ at the expense of its loyal fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to be a boxing fan,'' said Rob Etherington, a ceramic
tile installer occupying the stool next to Luxon. ``Look what
they've done for boxing. Now if I want to watch it, I've got to pay
10, 15 quid to Sky TV, don't I?''
</P>
<P>
   Etherington has given up boxing and fears he'll have to do he
same with soccer.
</P>
<P>
   He's not alone in his concerns. Andy Walsh, the president of
Manchester United Supporters Association, said fans will turn away
from the club if Murdoch succeeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rupert Murdoch will rape and pillage Manchester United,''
Walsh said. ``It's now up to the fans to show they are not going to
stand idly by and let this club be ripped from our grasp.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives for Murdoch _ particularly the two major
newspapers he owns in London _ say these concerns are unfounded, or
at least overblown. After weeks of rumors, BSkyB, of which Murdoch
is a 40 percent owner, this week offered to buy the team for more
than $1 billion, substantially more than the team's assessed value.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun, the tabloid owned by Murdoch, expressed some alarm in
its editorial pages over the reaction: ``Anyone would think BSkyB
wanted to close Old Trafford down, not pump millions into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Edwards, chairman of Manchester United, who has been the
target of much of the wrath, has asked for fans to be patient.
``All I can say is,'' he implored, ``before you string me up, give
me a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The government can approve the sale or pass it to the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission for review. In either case, the deal has
become a hot button issue that has swept President Clinton, the
economic crisis in Russia and just about every other story off the
front pages.
</P>
<P>
   When the sale was announced early in the week, The Mirror
published the story under the headline, ``Sold to the Devil,'' with
a picture of Murdoch complete with a set of Satanic horns.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, fans at the Old Trafford, the stadium in
Manchester that holds a nearly mystical appeal to soccer fans, held
up signs complaining about the purchase at a match against Charlton
Athletic _ which Manchester won handily 4-1. At one point, a
streaker ran across the field causing fans to point and yell,
``Look, it's Murdoch!''

 &HT;    BLACK FARMERS PRESS DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINTS
 &HT;    By EUNICE MOSCOSO
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fighting to be heard in a capital buzzing about
possible impeachment of the president, about 100 black farmers and
activists rallied in a park across from the White House for action
on their complaints of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``America needs a movement other than sex. America needs a
movement other than special prosecutors. ...America needs a
movement to break the dirty, racist discriminatory record of the
United States Department of Agriculture. That's the movement we
need,'' said Joseph Lowery, chairman of the Black Leadership Forum,
Inc., who hosted the event.
</P>
<P>
   The spirited rally was the latest in Washington this year to
highlight the plight of black farmers and to express outrage at the
inability of the Clinton administration to settle hundreds of
discrimination complaints against the Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the anger is directed towards a Justice Department
decision earlier this year to uphold a two-year statute of
limitations that bars hundreds of farmers from getting any cash
compensation even if they suffered discrimination in denial of
loans and other benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate and the House have approved legislation that would
waive the statute of limitations for claims from 1981 to 1997. The
measures are attached to agriculture appropriations bills that are
being reviewed by a conference committee, which works out the
differences between the House and Senate versions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the discrimination complaints, the Clinton
administration faces a $ 2 billion federal lawsuit filed by 600 of
the farmers over the long delays in settling cases. The lawsuit
seeks to represent the entire class of black farmers who have
suffered discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   A trial date of Feb. 1 has been set for the case, but lawyers
representing the farmers said Thursday they hope to settle before
then.
</P>
<P>
   John Boyd, president of the National Black Farmers Association,
said he is ``infuriated'' with the way the USDA Office of Civil
Rights has handled the complaints. The office ``has been and still
is dysfunctional and lacks integrity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Thursday's rally, participants changed the lyrics of
traditional civil rights songs to reflect their frustration. In
unison, they sang loudly: ``Tell Janet Reno, we shall not be moved.
Tell Dan Glickman, we shall not be moved. Tell USDA, we shall not
be moved.''

BABY HAZARDS ARE EVERYWHERE

<P>
   Families who keep their swimming pools safely locked away from
their young children might never consider the need to put locks on
their toilet lids.
</P>
<P>
   We all know to put poisons and electrical cords out of the reach
of toddlers, but what about dog food and drapery cords, forks and
bleach?
</P>
<P>
   A baby can easily choke on a morsel of dry pet food, says Ken
George, who suggests putting the pet's food and water on a tray and
lifting it to the top of a cabinet _ out of baby's reach _ between
feedings.
</P>
<P>
   He tells the story of a friend whose toddler was with her in the
laundry room, safely on the floor, when she stepped out to answer
the phone. The next thing she knew, the baby had pulled a bottle of
bleach from a low shelf and was sitting in a puddle of the caustic
chemical. The baby's bottom was badly burned before the mother
could get the bleach-soaked diaper off.
</P>
<P>
   George, a former police officer and national baby-safety expert
from California, advises parents and child-care workers about how
to keep young children safe at home.
</P>
<P>
   Accidents in the home kill more children than all childhood
diseases combined. Poisonings and falls lead the list, George says.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, an estimated 8,000 children younger than 15 are
killed and 50,000 are permanently disabled in home accidents,
according to the National Safety Council.
</P>
<P>
   The council's list of top home safety items includes smoke
detectors, carbon-monoxide detectors, ground-fault circuit
interrupters, fire extinguishers, an emergency evacuation plan, a
flashlight, a first-aid kit, a list of emergency phone numbers and
tagged shut-offs for gas and water valves.
</P>
<P>
   The council says that at least 1 in 4 American homes does not
have a fire extinguisher, and that 42 percent do not have a fire
evacuation plan.

TV PEOPLE FIND `MCBEAL' IS RIGHT UP THEIR `ALLY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Ally McBeal'' is one influential TV show. Consider all the new
fall series that have romance at their cores: ``Will &AMP; Grace''
(NBC), ``Felicity'' (The WB), ``To Have and to Hold'' (CBS),
``Fantasy Island'' (ABC), ``Cupid'' (ABC). You can thank ``Ally
McBeal'' for that.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the Irish surname thing. Last season, a whole
unemployment line of Hollywood writers wished ``Ally McBeal'' had
sprung from their laptops, but many of them have bounced back
nicely. The fruits of their labors are new shows such as
``Trinity,'' about the troubled but close-knit McCallister clan
(NBC). And ``Legacy,'' featuring the 19th-century Logans (UPN). And
``Costello,'' wherein someone with the perfectly Irish name of
Costello plays a person named Murphy (Fox). Sometime in the
midseason we'll see ``Turks'' (CBS), about a family of Irish
American cops named Turk. (Shouldn't it be McTurk? O'Turk?) And let
us not forget other fall entries like ``Hyperion Bay'' (The WB), in
which the family name is Sweeny, and ``Wind on Water'' (NBC), which
is lousy with Connollys.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps CBS's new fall series, ``To Have and to Hold,'' best
captures the ``Ally McBeal'' cachet. It is a romantic comedy, and
it has characters with Irish-sounding surnames (Cornell and
McGrail).
</P>
<P>
   And, since imitation is synonymous with creativity in the TV
industry, even more homages to ``Ally McBeal'' are likely. To help
in the development process, we dutifully suggest the following
treatments, which could be ready for air in a season or two. Or
maybe even next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alley McReal''
</P>
<P>
   Searching for truer grit while reducing its budget, MTV would
merge ``The Real World'' with ``Road Rules'' to focus on a dozen
Gen-X'ers living out of a Dublin Dumpster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bali McKneel''
</P>
<P>
   In this drama for ABC, a rebel Irish-Catholic priest is
reassigned to a parish in the South Pacific after beaning the
bishop during the diocesan softball game. Kevin Anderson reprises
the role of Father Ray from ``Nothing Sacred,'' but the thorniest
issue he confronts is whether to wear socks with his sandals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bally McSchlemiel''
</P>
<P>
   An uncoordinated athlete tries to gain the acceptance of his
Fighting Irish teammates by working out at a total-fitness spa,
where he falls in love with a woman who wears expensive Swiss-made
cross-training shoes. Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher are reunited in
this heartwarming UPN drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cali McHeal''
</P>
<P>
   Hector Elizondo plays a courageous physician who, with the help
of the IRA, sets up a preferred-provider organization for employees
of the Colombian drug cartel in this lighthearted spinoff of CBS's
``Chicago Hope.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Challis McSqueal''
</P>
<P>
   In a knockoff of ``Babe,'' a pig from an Irish farm gets a job
in the garment industry after using lambs wool to design some
summer-weight coveralls for the local farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dally McPeal''
</P>
<P>
   USA Network continues its foray into prime-time drama with a
miniseries based loosely on Hemingway's ``For Whom the Bell
Tolls.'' The main character, played by Lorenz O'Lamas, is supposed
to blow up a bridge during the Spanish Civil War, but he repeatedly
delays the mission because he thinks he sees a span-dancing baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deli McDeal''
</P>
<P>
   From NBC Studios comes this wacky Tea Leoni comedy about a
high-powered theatrical agent who won't sign new clients until
they've shared a corned-beef sandwich and a pint of Guinness with
her Irish setter, Mulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finale McReel''
</P>
<P>
   In this one-time special, American Movie Classics takes a look
at the sentimental endings of the most popular Irish-themed films
of all time. With music by Bing Crosby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Galley McVeal''
</P>
<P>
   A new Saturday afternoon cooking show from PBS features recipes
that use only the meat of calves raised on Irish whiskey and
shepherd's pie. Hosted by Colin Quinn of ``Saturday Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rally McWheel''
</P>
<P>
   Fox tracks down never-before-seen footage of the wildest crashes
from the Irish road-racing circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sally McField''
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;E aims to snare some unsuspecting viewers with this coyly
titled installment of ``Biography,'' slated for St. Patrick's Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Svengali McSpiel''
</P>
<P>
   A maleficent sales manager gets the most out of his trainees by
making them recite their sales pitches in the tradition of the
Irish Literary Renaissance, with particular emphasis on the style
of John Millington Synge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tally McThiel''
</P>
<P>
   In this first sitcom from ESPN2, a prominent Seattle sports
columnist becomes official scorer of the Irish national soccer
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Valley McMeal''
</P>
<P>
   Three teenagers get work at, like, a McDonald's in, like,
Southern California. Starring, like, whoever's been in the latest
summertime horror film. On The WB.

`THE ROUNDERS' LOOKS LIKE A GOOD BET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The title characters of John Dahl's highly derivative but
hard-to-resist gambling drama, ``Rounders,'' are a pair of
high-stakes, Manhattan poker hustlers _ players proficient enough
at the game they can always earn a decent living at it and
sometimes make a killing.
</P>
<P>
   More specifically, they are Mike (Matt Damon), a young law
student so gifted at figuring player psychology that he can
practically read minds, and his best friend, Worm (Edward Norton),
who is gutsy but considerably less talented.
</P>
<P>
   As the film opens, Mike _ who narrates virtually every scene _
has gathered up $30,000 and challenged the Minnesota Fats of the
New York City poker world: a wily Russian named KGB (John
Malkovich), who promptly cleans out the young challenger.
</P>
<P>
   Devastated by his loss, Mike decides to give up the game and
devote himself to the law _ a decision that pleases his live-in
lover and fellow law student, Jo (Gretchen Mol), but only
temporarily numbs that world poker champion inside him that's
begging to get out.
</P>
<P>
   When Worm is released from a brief prison sentence, he naturally
tries to lure Mike back to the table. And he does it by getting
himself in so deep with a brutal loan shark that Mike has to take
out the cards again to bail the lovable jerk out. Once there, well
...
</P>
<P>
   The script is immensely Runyonesque and filled with poker slang
_ almost to a fault. At times, it's impossible not to get bogged
down in the colorful vocabulary and lost in what's happening at the
table. (Critics have been provided with a short glossary of terms
to help sort things out.)
</P>
<P>
   The film is also not exactly high on originality. David Levien
and Brian Koppelman's script _ with its many philosophical
discussions on the nature of winners and losers _ appears to have
benefited from viewings of the two '60s classics of the
smoke-filled room, ``The Hustler'' (1961) and ``The Cincinnati
Kid'' (1965).
</P>
<P>
   And when it dips down into the tired subplot in which Mike's
need to become a poker great is tested by the higher calling of the
law _ represented by both his nagging girlfriend and the world's
most kindly law professor (Martin Landau) _ ``Rounders'' often
smacks uncomfortably of a John Grisham clone.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Dahl (``Kill Me Again,'' ``Red Rock West,'' ``The Last
Seduction'') handles this kind of back-alley material extremely
well. Even if his scenes seem familiar, they fairly crackle with
tension and authenticity, and move along at an exhilarating pace.
Dahl is clearly at the top of the large class of Gen-X directors
who specialize in neo-film noir.
</P>
<P>
   With arguably the two best young actors in America heading the
cast, the film also works as a star vehicle. Damon has his own
natural, unassuming, likable style that gets more appealing with
every movie; and the versatile Norton (``Primal Fear'') _ whose
portrayal of a low-life sharpie is totally convincing _ shows every
indication of becoming the Gene Hackman of his generation.
</P>
<P>
   Rounders. Directed by John Dahl. Written by David Levien and
Brian Koppelman. Cast: Matt Damon, Edward Norton, John Malkovich,
Gretchen Mol, Martin Landau, Famke Janssen. Miramax. 120 minutes.
Rated R for language, violence and some nudity.

   Grade: B

`SIMON BIRCH': A TINY BOY WITH A BIG HEART AND A BIGGER PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
(JT) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Simon Birch,'' Mark Steven Johnson's insufferably precious
``reduction'' of John Irving's popular 1989 novel ``A Prayer for
Owen Meany,'' might be described as the movie equivalent of a piece
of stale angel food cake. Bite into it, and what you'll find is a
nearly flavorless mixture of air and sugar and more sugar and a
texture so parched that a mouthful is almost impossible to swallow
without risk of choking.
</P>
<P>
   From its opening scenes, it is sadly apparent why Irving, who
wrote an early draft of the screenplay and later asked that the
title character's name be changed and the movie be credited as
being ``suggested'' by the novel, wanted to distance himself from
the project. The moment that Simon Birch, the tiniest child in the
history of the Maine hospital in which he's born, first enters the
world and miraculously survives, the movie flaunts a terminal case
of the cutes.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the film, which is narrated in a hushed, saccharine
tone by Simon's best friend, Joe Wenteworth, who has now grown up
and is looking back on his childhood (Jim Carrey plays the grown-up
Joe but isn't shown on camera except for a brief smirking
appearance at the end of the film), a shot of Simon's gravestone
lets us know that the angelic scamp is not long for this world.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the movie, which jettisons the novel's Vietnam war
plot, is set in 1964, the year Simon dies. And you may rest assured
that if there is a heaven the title character, a partly disabled
dwarf, whom Ian Michael Smith plays with the squeaky-voiced
``sincerity'' of an Edward Keane child brought to life, ascends
there instantly.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood has never been known to be particularly honest about
death, especially where children are concerned. But among the silly
deathbed scenes Hollywood has concocted, Simon's final exit has to
rank among the 10 most bogus. Lying peacefully in a hospital bed
after having helped save his Sunday School classmates from drowning
in an icy lake after a school bus accident, our diminutive hero
appears to be the picture of radiant good health, if just a trifle
drowsy. When Joe (Joseph Mazzello plays the 12-year-old Joe)
tiptoes into the room, the saintly little tyke sleepily opens his
eyes just long enough to recognize his pal and murmur contentedly,
``Gotta go now.'' To which the brave, misty-eyed Joe replies with a
lump in his throat, ``See ya later, alligator.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the rest of the film follows Simon and Joe around their
idyllic New England hometown during Simon's final year on earth as
each boy tries to answer a burning personal question. Simon
believes his survival against all odds means he has a special
heroic purpose on earth. He pesters the scowling local priest, the
Reverend Russell (David Strathairn), and his starchy Sunday school
teacher (Jan Hooks) to confirm his intuition.
</P>
<P>
   Joe, the illegitimate son of the prettiest woman in town,
Rebecca Wenteworth (Ashley Judd), desperately longs to know which
of the locals is his father, but Rebecca's lips are sealed. Simon
ultimately helps Joe uncover the truth. Its discovery involves a
baseball and a tragic freak accident on the playing field. Also
hanging around the movie is a kindly suitor of Rebecca's named Ben
Goodrich (Oliver Platt), who, after popping into the film with a
stuffed armadillo under his arm, seems to have no other purpose
than to be a roly-poly all-purpose cheerleader for the rest of the
characters.
</P>
<P>
   How dramatic is ``Simon Birch''? Let's put it this way: the
movie's comic climax is a children's Christmas pageant that
devolves into chaos when an agrophobic angel, lowered from the
rafters on a cable, becomes so frightened he loses his lunch. The
unfunny sequence is so sloppily directed that you can't really
follow what's happening from one moment to the next.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever ``Simon Birch'' can't figure out what pose it wants to
strike, it pours on the music (by Marc Shaiman) composed in a
generic Hollywood style that ought to be labeled American teardrop.
It's all folksy little themes with plaintive undertones. No doubt
there are those who will deem ``Simon Birch'' ``heartwarming.'' It
is exactly the kind of movie that has given that hackneyed
superlative a bad name.

`DIGGING TO CHINA': TWO INNOCENTS TRAPPED IN AN INDIFFERENT
REALITY  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some awfully familiar buttons are pushed in ``Digging to
China,'' the story of a sweetly eccentric 10-year-old girl's
friendship with a sweetly eccentric 30-year-old man who happens to
be mentally disabled. Although there's nothing intrinsically false
about the story of these two lonely misfits forming a deep
emotional bond, which the outside world views with suspicion, the
movie, directed by the actor Timothy Hutton (in his debut behind
the camera) from a screenplay by Karen Janszen, is entirely
predictable. The moment these two innocents share their first
cuddly embrace you know somebody's going to get the wrong idea. You
also know that sooner or later their idyll will be rudely
shattered.
</P>
<P>
   At its best, the movie finds Kevin Bacon stretching his
formidable talents to deliver a poignant stunt performance as Ricky
Schroth, a twitching, compulsively smiling grown-up with the mind
of a child. If Bacon isn't able to lose himself in his character
the way Dustin Hoffman did in ``Rain Man,'' his portrayal of a shy
frightened young man who is just smart enough to know he's mentally
handicapped is touching and believable.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky is being driven to a home for the mentally disabled by his
ailing mother, Leah (Marian Seldes), who has been found to have
cancer, when their car breaks down somewhere in the rural East.
Mother and son are forced to stay in a family-run motel, where
Ricky meets Harriet Frankovitz (Evan Rachel Wood), the wildly
imaginative girl who becomes his soul mate.
</P>
<P>
   Harriet's mother (Cathy Moriarty), a bitter, tough-talking
alcoholic, runs the motel with the help of her sullen, slatternly
26-year-old daughter, Gwen (Mary Stuart Masterston). When Mrs.
Frankovitz gets behind the wheel of a car she tends to weave down
the center of the road. In the movie's only unpredictable moment,
she dies in a car accident, leaving Harriet in the care of the
older sister, who reveals herself, to the little girl's horror, to
be Harriet's biological mother.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, set in the late 1960s, strains hard to portray
Harriet as an adorably precocious child whose wild imagination is a
sign of a her superior intelligence and artistic potential. In the
voice-over narration that opens the movie, Harriet confesses her
lifelong desire to escape to another world via magic carpet or
flying saucer. Once, she recalls, she started digging a hole in the
ground hoping to tunnel through the center of the earth directly to
China. In one scene, Harriet literally tries to fly away by
attaching a bunch of helium balloons to a chair.
</P>
<P>
   Harriet and Ricky's bond has everything to do with their desire
to escape from a hostile, indifferent world. Harriet's grandiose
fantasies have made her a joke among her classmates, who taunt her
every day on the bus ride to school. Ricky's future is grimmer. He
knows that he is being dropped off at an institution and that he
may soon lose the mother who has loved and protected him. In the
most dramatic sequence, the two friends run away together and camp
out in the woods in an abandoned caboose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Digging to China,'' to its credit, doesn't grab at the
heartstrings and strum an aggressively mawkish ballad. In fact, it
could do with a bit more heart. Part of the problem is Ms. Wood's
Harriet. The young actress is radiantly photogenic, but her
performance is muted and monochromatic. As she confides her
fantasies, you never have the sense of the volatile emotional life
out of which they are spun. No matter what she says, Ms. Wood's
Harriet sounds sensible and self-contained to the point of
blandness. Without an incandescent performance at its center,
``Digging to China'' follows the same path as Harriet's balloon
escape. It gets stuck in the trees.
</P>

`DAVID SEARCHING': A MAN AND A WOMAN, EACH SEEKING A MR. RIGHT  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANITA GATES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``David Searching'' is the kind of movie in which people walk
around Manhattan discussing the pros and cons of cappuccino in a
can. In which the title character is asked what kind of man he's
looking for and answers, ``Gilgamesh.'' The cast includes a batch
of great people. If only it added up to something more than navel
gazing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   David (Anthony Rapp, the skinny blond guy from ``Rent'') is a
young aspiring documentary filmmaker who blames cable television
for all the world's ills. He has one great pretentious idea, no
money, no boyfriend and a two-bedroom in the East Village that he
can't afford alone. Gwen (Camryn Manheim, the chubby lawyer from
``The Practice'') is his new, newly separated roommate, who does
not think for a minute that her plus-size figure might detract from
her sexual appeal to men. In fact, she and a visitor, Walter,
hungrily jump into bed together pretty much on first sight. (During
a fight, Walter's girlfriend told him to go back where he came from
and he used to live in David's apartment, so here he is.)
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Spinella turns up in a priceless blink-of-an-eye cameo
as a blind date who has had one hummus platter too many. Kathleen
Chalfant appears as David's Southern grandmother in one of his
self-consciously sensitive film clips. (It's a mini-``Angels in
America'' reunion.) John Cameron Mitchell, now best known as the
creator of ``Hedwig and the Angry Inch,'' is another date, who
quotes James Baldwin and Joan Didion while carefully choosing
grapes. David Drake, best known for his play ``The Night Larry
Kramer Kissed Me,'' picks David up on the street but fails to live
up to his romantic dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond those cameos, the plot, which naturally revolves around
David, consists largely of a series of canceled, missed and
rescheduled meetings with PBS along with a series of wistful
sojourns in search of sex (from an actual sex club to Central
Park), mixed with roommate encounters and wacky scenes with an
entertainer (Julie Halston, playing herself) whom David meets on
the subway. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's impressive that the film, which opens today at the
Quad Cinema, was made for $22,500 (the stars with cameos reportedly
worked free), but so was ``The Brothers McMullen.'' The basic flaw
in ``David Searching,'' which was written and directed by Leslie
Smith, a playwright, magazine writer and former press agent, is
that it doesn't go anywhere. The filmmaker, like David, just loves
to hear himself talk, so he puts his edgy, articulate voice into
every character. These excellent actors do wonders with the script,
but it's still mostly a one-note trip. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Fuqua, as Walter, has a very funny, cartoonish scene that
takes place after a sexual encounter in David and Gwen's living
room is interrupted. Only moviegoers with their eyes at the bottom
of the screen will see it.

`WITHOUT LIMITS': FINISHING FIRST, EVEN WHEN HE DIDN'T 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
(JT) 
 By JANET MASLIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though the link between the mercurial track star Steve
Prefontaine, who died in 1975 at 24, and the veteran Hollywood
screenwriter Robert Towne is not immediately obvious, Towne's
Prefontaine biography is the most stirring and unmistakably
personal film he has directed. In ``Without Limits,'' a writer
famed for enriching screenplays (his own and others') with the gift
of unruly, unpredictable life has taken on a curiously amorphous
subject and invested it with deep, reflective power. And precisely
because this sports story is not about winning, losing or even how
you play the game, it becomes a broader parable than the viewer has
any reason to expect. Its wisdom, and clearly Towne's, lies in the
film's way of filtering a young man's headstrong nature through an
older man's more rueful point of view.
</P>
<P>
   On an Oregon hillside, with a tranquil unspoiled landscape in
the background, the film's two principals match philosophies so
intensely that they might be discussing Eastern religion, even if
their ostensible subject is Prefontaine's running career. The
renowned coach Bill Bowerman, played by with great, wry authority
by Donald Sutherland, appears to have met his match in
Prefontaine's enigmatic nature. As a maverick who could rebel his
way to the finish line (and set seven American speed records in the
process), the track star is seen here as captivatingly arrogant in
ways his coach can neither resist nor really change. In a role
originally intended for Tom Cruise, handsome Billy Crudup shows an
insouciant charisma to match the real Prefontaine's, along with a
sly elusiveness that's just right for a character with such innate
star quality.
</P>
<P>
   Though it has been the basis for two films (Steve James'
``Prefontaine'' conveyed much of the same information),
Prefontaine's story is nobody's idea of sure-thing movie material.
He didn't always win, he didn't trumpet his principles and there's
no real evidence that he would have lived happily ever after if not
for the car crash that ended his life. But it's this very
stubbornness to the story that Towne explores most effectively,
presenting a glimpse of the athlete's complicated experience and
appreciating how life often confounds expectations. A long, bravura
re-creation of Prefontaine's race at the 1972 Munich Olympics
becomes a fascinating display of strategy and determination, with
the Prefontaine and Bowerman ideas about running visibly at war as
the race unfolds. Unlike virtually any other film about sports,
this one doesn't pretend to be certain who was right.
</P>
<P>
   It is Bowerman, often seen tinkering with the waffle-patterned
rubber he would use to invent the Nike running shoe, who advocated
taking the longer view, advising Prefontaine to gauge his strength
and think about the whole race. It is Prefontaine who can't bear to
be anywhere but out in front of the pack, and who lives in the
moment with stoical determination. (``I can endure more pain than
anyone you've ever met,'' Towne's screenplay has him saying.
``That's why I can beat anyone you've ever met.'') Ordinarily, this
contrast between a young man's brashness and an older man's
experience might play out in predictable, sentimental ways, but
``Without Limits'' sees a bigger picture. Though Towne's graceful
writing never resorts to obvious pronouncements, the film seems to
say that both pushing limits and knowing them are eventually vital
parts of anyone's truest nature.
</P>
<P>
   While immersing itself in the world of running, and in the
golden aura surrounding the University of Oregon and its Hayward
Field in the 1970s, the film dwells avidly on the sight of athletes
in glorious slow motion (though it does this a lot less lecherously
than Towne's ``Personal Best''). It also observes the shy courtship
between Prefontaine and Mary Marckx (Monica Potter, seen as Nicolas
Cage's generically pretty wife in ``Con Air''), another
relationship presented in a light of ambiguity and struggle despite
the sun-kissed Hollywood look of the actors.
</P>
<P>
   Towne especially excels at the smaller touches that bring such
connections to life, whether it's an ear for pop music or a clear
familiarity with college girls, circa 1970, or the group of bonsai
trees that presumably occupy Bowerman when he isn't measuring feet
and molding rubber. His proudly unconventional ``Without Limits''
is filled with such souvenirs of the real world.
</P>

THIRD WORLD ECONOMIES' ROCKET GROWTH TO BOOST FIRST WORLD, ADVISER
SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA MCUSIC 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It took Britain 60 years to double its output _ from the
Industrial Revolution to the late 18th century.
</P>
<P>
   The United States needed 50 years to double its gross domestic
product in the mid-19th century.
</P>
<P>
   China is doing it in seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomical growth throughout what used to be known as the
Third World is becoming a force too strong to ignore, investment
adviser and Columbia University Professor Peter Marber says in his
latest book.
</P>
<P>
   That growth will have a profound and ultimately positive effect
on developed nations' economies as well, he predicts. Major
corporations are leading the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``For ... multinational corporations, the five billion citizens
living in the developing world are no longer the Earth's wretched
but its salt: both as new cheaper producers and as new customers
that will propel First World economies upward in the twenty-first
century,'' Marber writes.
</P>
<P>
   Marber presents his optimistic economic theories in ``From Third
Class to World Class: The Future of Emerging Markets in the Global
Economy'' (Perseus Books, 272 pages, $30).
</P>
<P>
   If you still think of the Third World as being plagued with
poverty, war and very low standards of living, take a look at the
picture Marber paints:
</P>
<P>
   The poverty rate is down. The percentage of people living in
poverty in the developing world has halved since 1960, according to
CARE.
</P>
<P>
   The population is up. In 1950, the developing world held 1.2
billion, or 55 percent of the world population. By 2000, the number
of people will be 4.8 billion, or 85 percent, partly because of a
lower infant mortality rate. By 2050, the numbers will go to 9.5
billion, or 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The literacy rate is up. In 1950, the literacy rate of the
developing world was 33 percent. By 2000, 64 percent of the people
will be reading and writing; by 2050, the rate is estimated to be
90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Elements are in place for major shifts in the economies of the
developing nations as well, Marber writes. Currently, the economies
of those countries collectively make up less than 22 percent of the
world income and 12 percent of the global stock market
capitalization _ even though the fact that those areas hold nearly
85 percent of the world's population and 77 percent of the Earth's
land mass.
</P>
<P>
   But the World Bank reports that developing nations' economies
are growing more than 6 percent a year, doubling their GDP every 12
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``These rates are unprecedented and are dramatically altering
the distribution of power in the global economy,'' Marber writes.
``Many of those we consider Third World countries today will most
likely attain `First World' economic status within two or three
generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Marber discusses this economic shift with chapters on
multinational corporations, the global economy, new technologies,
investors in emerging markets and the winners and losers of the
future. The chapters include many little-known facts about how
corporations and countries are changing the economic picture.
</P>
<P>
   Marber talks about the four African ``Tigers'' _ Zambia, Angola,
Lesotho and Malawi _ where large-scale privatization and economic
reform are triggering strong growth. He discusses the E7, or the
emerging seven countries of the world that have dwarfed their
developed counterparts, the G7, in population. The E7 are Brazil,
China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Along with observations on the new world economic order, Marber
spends time arguing against the common perception that these shifts
will be bad for the West. In fact, protectionism of Western
economies is the greatest obstacle to cashing in on the
opportunities created by the emergence of those markets, he
suggests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isolating ourselves or longing for the past seems fruitless if
not foolish,'' he writes. ``After all, there are billions of people
in the developing world who are becoming economically enfranchised
as never before in history. ... The Earth's advanced societies must
capitalize on these burgeoning new markets, remain technologically
superior, enhance their financial savvy, and embrace the
competitive world of the twenty-first century.''

OPPORTUNITIES IN CHINESE FURNITURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The conventional wisdom about Chinese furniture could
be a variant of Duke Ellington's 1932 song about swing: ``It don't
mean a thing if it ain't got that Ming.'' Collectors have long
focused on furniture of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) in two
varieties of rosewood: huanghuali and zitan.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese period room at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, for
example, is the Ming Room, and it is full of such hardwoods.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that Ming antiques are getting rare and extremely
expensive (pieces start at about $50,000 each), and it's difficult
for nonexperts to distinguish them from later pieces that one could
charitably label ``maybe Ming.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Flacks is trying to offer a new focus in ``Woods of
China,'' a show opening on Monday in his gallery, M.D. Flacks
Oriental Furniture and Art, at 38 East 57th Street in Manhattan,
through Oct. 23.
</P>
<P>
   He is showing 22 pieces of fine classical Chinese furniture in
elm, boxwood, camphor, cypress and pear (among others) that were
made between the late 16th and early 19th centuries. They are a
fraction of the price of the huanghuali and zitan Ming and early
Qing pieces that he normally features.
</P>
<P>
   His timing is apt; next week is Asia Week in New York.
Collectors are congregating for the Asian art auctions, starting
with the Doyle sale on Monday. Christie's classical Chinese
furniture sale is on Wednesday, and Sotheby's is on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   There are several Asian specialists in Wendy's New York Armory
Antiques Show, which opens on Tuesday at the Seventh Regiment
Armory on Park Avenue at 67th Street and runs through Saturday.
(Information: (212) 472-1180.)
</P>
<P>
   The Fifth Avenue Asian Art Fair, at the Sinclair-Fletcher
Mansion on Fifth Avenue at 79th Street, runs from Thursday through
Sunday, with a benefit preview on Wednesday for Tibet House.
(Information: (212) 249-4865.) Finally, the New York Arts of
Pacific Asia show will be at the Armory at Gramercy Park from Oct.
17 through Oct. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty-percent of the great Chinese furniture in the world
(iialics)is(end italics) huanghuali and zitan,'' Flacks said. ``But
not all furniture made of huanghuali and zitan are works of art.
After years of research, we know other woods were employed for
top-quality furniture.''
</P>
<P>
   Flacks organized his exhibition to prove this. ``It's the first
show of this type that's been done in the West,'' he said, adding
that some of the woods, like jichimu (chicken-wing wood) and tieli
(ironwood), ``have no real equivalent here.''
</P>
<P>
   The furniture includes a spare and elegant 18th-century yokeback
chair in heitan (black rosewood). Its form is among the most
classical in Chinese furniture, with a backward-turning crest rail,
gooseneck armrests and an S-cured back splat showing striations
that look like crotch mahogany.
</P>
<P>
   It was made, Flacks said, to highlight the figured wood on the
back splat: ``It shows that furniture of the highest quality was
commissioned in different woods to take advantage of their
particular qualities, regardless of whether huanghuali and zitan
were available.''
</P>
<P>
   A side table, also from the 18th century, with smoothly rounded
edges and delicate, wavelike spandrels, is made of hetao (Chinese
walnut). With its four slender legs, hoof feet and gently rounded
corners, it looks like a thoroughbred horse bending to munch grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``People argue that the quality of design and craftsmanship of
Chinese furniture deteriorated after the 17th century,'' Flacks
said. ``But this table proves that furniture of the highest quality
was produced well into the 18th century. If this table were
huanghuali, it would cost $250,000. I'm asking $45,000.''
</P>
<P>
   One historically interesting piece is a small folding stool of
yumu (elm) from the 18th century. Flacks explained that the Western
nomadic tribes probably introduced the stool to China in the Han
Dynasty (206 B.C. to A.D. 220) for traveling, hunting and military
campaigns. Eventually, the stool was domesticated and came indoors.
</P>
<P>
   Theow-Huang Tow, a Christie's specialist in Chinese works of
art, does not take Chinese softwood furniture under consignment.
``It's not profitable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lark E. Mason Jr. at Sotheby's disagrees. ``A new generation is
trying to collect the alternative woods, or at least pieces of the
highest quality,'' he said. ``But it takes a lot of knowledge. You
have to spend time and do your homework, because basic shapes were
repeated over and over. It's extremely difficult to find
18th-century softwood pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   Mason noted that much Chinese furniture was originally
lacquered, so you see woods that were intended to be covered. His
advice? ``Focus on quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's has two 19th-century elm side tables, with estimates
in the $6,000 range. Lot 272 is a 17th-century gilt-incised lacquer
table decorated with cloud forms and dragons (estimate: $18,000 to
$25,000). Mason said these were rare, since incised lacquer tables
came from Imperial workshops and ``the French have scooped them
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Lot 275 at Sotheby's is a pair of 19th-century armchairs in
jichimu, the so-called chicken-wing wood, because it looks feathery
when cut tangentially (estimate: $5,000 to $7,000). ``Sets of
anything in China are hard to find,'' Mason pointed out. ``They
tended to be broken up in the family.''
</P>
<P>
   John Meyer, owner of LiAsiatic in Charlemont, Mass., has
specialized in what he calls ``offbeat Chinese woods'' since 1983.
(He will be at next week's Armory show.) He said he believed that
all Chinese softwood furniture was originally lacquered. Because
Chinese furniture is constructed with elaborate mortise-and-tenon
joinery instead of nails, it is relatively easy to disassemble,
which is why we see so many stripped pieces, in his view.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer is selling what he calls an ``untouched'' calligraphy
table of Chinese walnut with a central panel in white cypress. ``A
piece of good softwood furniture now costs between $5,000 and
$10,000,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   KoKo Chinese Antiques, at 42 East 66th Street in Manhattan,
sells softwood antiques in the $3,000 to $12,000 price range. The
co-owner, Marilyn Ko, who will also be at the New York Armory
Antiques show, has an 18th-century lacquered walnut low scroll
table for $7,800, a pair of 19th-century elmwood benches for $2,680
and an 18th-century walnut altar table with carved Tao symbols for
$12,800.
</P>
<P>
   Dragon Culture Antiques, at 226 East 51st Street, Manhattan,
another Armory exhibitor, is selling a red lacquered wine table,
elmwood screens and a 19th-century elmwood altar table. The owner,
Lily Choi, said her prices range from $1,000 to $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   For neophytes, Chinese antiques can be tricky. New dealers are
flooding the market. New Web sites, from Honolulu to Hong Kong,
have opened in the last year. For example, you can buy a black elm
cabinet, reportedly mid-Qing, for $650, or a supposedly late Qing
cypress cabinet for $320, directly from G.E. Tang in Shanghai
(www.getang.com).
</P>
<P>
   Flacks urges caution, however. ``There are said to be 300
warehouses full of furniture north of Hong Kong,'' he said. ``They
are sending `antiques' by the container full. Not all the pieces
are antiques.''

   Fish is good for the head as well as the heart, say medical
researchers reporting at a recent National Institutes of Health
workshop on omega-3 essential fatty acids.
</P>
<P>
   Eating more fish holds promise in the prevention and treatment
of a number of devastating mental illnesses, including major
depression, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, the scientists said
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier research has linked omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids
(PUFA), found primarily in fish, to a lower risk of coronary artery
disease, irregular heart rhythms and some forms of cancer and
arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Data suggest that eating more fish will raise levels of fatty
acids in the blood and may raise serotonin levels in the brain,''
said Dr. Joseph Hibbeln of the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse
and Alcoholism. Low levels of serotonin are the most common
clinical finding in people with depression.
</P>
<P>
   Studies indicate that major depression is the greatest single
cause of time lost to disability worldwide, Hibbeln added. More
than 15 million Americans suffer from major depression at any one
time. At least 2 million Americans suffer from bipolar disorder,
commonly known as manic depression.
</P>
<P>
   There is also mounting evidence that people suffering from
schizophrenia have depleted levels of omega-3 PUFA, said Dr.
Malcolm Peet of the University of Sheffield in the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   In two recent studies, the addition of fatty-acid supplements to
the diets of schizophrenic patients who were not responding to drug
therapy led to a significant decrease in delusions and
hallucinations, Peet said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to depression, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder,
researchers presented new data on the role of essential fatty acids
in postpartum depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,
aggression/hostility and violence.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers all cautioned against self-treating major mental
disorders or substituting established drug treatments with diets
containing a lot of fish.
</P>
<P>
   In all the new studies, fish oil was used to supplement
medications. People would have to eat fish two or three times every
day to get the amounts of omega-3 PUFA used in studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably too much fish for most Americans. We were
shooting for very high doses. We don't know what the minimum dose
is,'' said Dr. Jerry Cott of the National Institute of Mental
Health.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   EAT MORE FISH
</P>
<P>
   Eating fish just once a week can cut in half the risk of sudden
cardiac death, according to one study reported this year.
</P>
<P>
   Helpful hint: Hold the mayo.
</P>
<P>
   Reduce your intake of salad dressing, corn oil and butter _ and
avoid excessive alcohol and tobacco _ to better use the omega-3
fatty acids you take in from the fish, recommends Dr. Joseph
Hibbeln of the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get more bang for your buck from every can of tuna
primarily from not using salad dressing,'' Hibbeln says. ``One good
way is to switch to olive oil when making tuna salad. The
combination of fish and olive oil is even better. ... Also, you can
increase your intake of walnuts, flax peas and flax seed oil and
fry in canola oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Sardines, caviar and tuna have high amounts of beneficial
omega-3 fatty acids.
</P>
<P>
   Also, several food manufacturers are working on products
fortified with omega-3.

 &HT;    A MAN FOR ONE SEASON? ``THE ULTIMATE SURVIVOR'' MAY NOT LAST
LONG
 &HT;    With RUSSIA-CRISIS
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Yevgeny Primakov, a pragmatic man once described as the
ultimate Kremlin survivor, now must find a way to rescue Russia
from its deep economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The 68-year-old former journalist, spymaster and diplomat was
tapped Thursday by President Boris Yeltsin to lead Russia as prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   It is the latest task in a string of big assignments over the
decade for a man who has played a prominent but unassuming role in
Russia's difficult transformation from Communist authoritarianism
to unfulfilled democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, when Mikhail Gorbachev sought an even-handed
administrator to oversee the breakup of the all-powerful Soviet KGB
intelligence and security force, he called on Primakov.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, when Yeltsin sought to restore credibility to Russian
foreign policy after regional conflicts nibbled away at the former
empire, he called on Primakov to become foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Primakov was a reluctant nominee.
</P>
<P>
   He has been asked to lead government at time of bitter rivalry
between the Kremlin and opponents in the Communist-dominated
parliament. Primakov urged Yeltsin not to appoint him, citing his
lack of economic expertise and poor health.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts Primakov possesses a strong intellect and, until
now, the wisdom to avoid Russia's fierce political infighting. He
is an old-school technocrat, a year older then Yeltsin himself, in
a new and changing political landscape as the Russian economy
spirals out of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a respected political figure against whom conflicting
forces will be working,'' said Georgi Bovt, an analyst for Sevodnya
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Kiev and raised in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi,
Primakov graduated amid the Cold War in 1953 from Moscow's
prestigious Institute for Oriental Studies, whose best graduates
were often recruited as future KGB spies.
</P>
<P>
   An unpretentious man who eschews the limelight, Primakov joined
the Communist Party in 1959 and began his professional ascent
during the reign of Nikita Khrushchev. An Arabic speaker and
specialist in Middle East affairs, he was assigned to Cairo for the
Communist Party newspaper Pravda, and in the custom of the times
his duties almost certainly included parttime spying.
</P>
<P>
   He advanced to Russia's elite political circles during the stoic
Soviet era of Leonid Brezhnev when he served as an academic and
foreign policy adviser. When the thaw came in the late 1980s, he
was a close aide to Gorbachev and member of the Soviet Politburo.
He remained on top during the many highs and lows of Yeltsin's
Russia as head of the foreign intelligence service and until
Thursday as the nation's top diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   As the ultimate survivor, Primakov also is the ultimate Russian
enigma. He is alternatively described as shy, but warm; easygoing,
but tough. He projects the image of a dull functionary, but admits
to being a fan of John le Carre spy novels and a sip of vodka now
and again.
</P>
<P>
   Selected by Gorbachev in 1991 to oversee a reorganization of the
KGB. He said at the time the new mission of the spy agency was to
``do everything possible to rule out a return to the Cold War.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was during his time that the Soviets and later Russians
savored one of their biggest espionage coups over the United
States, until super-agent Aldrich Ames was unmasked in 1994 as a
Russian mole in the upper ranks of the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   As foreign minister since1996, he saw his mission to uphold
Russia's prominence in world affairs even as the nation's
superpower status wilted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time will come when Russia will have a strong enough economy
to reclaim the international position it deserves,'' he said in a
speech to students at Russia's elite diplomatic academy last fall.
``Until then we should hold the front quietly and build a strong
foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Like any good diplomat, his specialty seemed to be building good
personal relations and professional objectives.
</P>
<P>
   He confronted U.S. policy on Iraq, Iran and the Balkans, yet
maintained a warm relationship with U.S. Secretary of State
Madeline Albright.
</P>
<P>
   He has known Iraq's Saddam Hussein since 1969, and used his
rapport to travel to Baghdad in 1991 seeking an Iraqi troop
withdrawal from Kuwait just before American commanders launched the
first attacks of the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Now, his ability to meld personal stature and policy motives
have left him as the consensus choice to lead a leaderless nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Primakov is liked by Yeltsin, but also by the Communists and
nationalists because of his ministry's willingness to cross the
West. That same assertiveness and vision is exactly what Russia
needs at the helm now,'' the Moscow Times said in an editorial on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   He appears to be a compelling figure who, if he remains healthy,
could restore Russia to a sense of normalcy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many analysts view Primakov as merely a transitional leader
amid predictions of Yeltsin's early retirement and early elections.
Primakov will play a role, but not the starring one in the pivotal
months ahead in Russia's political life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeltsin is finished politically after such a humiliation as
this. His resignation is just a matter of time. He has no
credibility left,'' said Andrei Piontkovsky of the Strategic
Studies Center, a Moscow think tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Primakov) is the best option to see that the transition
takes place in an orderly fashion. He can preside as a politically
neutral figure with no presidential ambitions of his own,'' he
added. ``But he won't last.''

`LET'S TALK ABOUT SEX': WHAT'S EVERYONE TALKING ABOUT? (HINT: NOT
THE WEATHER) 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review.) 
(JT) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Jazz (Troy Beyer), an advice columnist for a Miami
newspaper, pitches her idea for a television show in which women
talk frankly about their sex lives, the local station manager
brusquely informs her that a description isn't enough; she must
submit a sample program.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by her roommates Michelle (Paget Brewster) and Lena
(Randi Ingerman), Jazz, armed with a video camera, dashes around
the streets of Miami questioning random women about their sex lives
and what they like and don't like about men. Everyone she
approaches seems more than eager to spill the beans. The collective
fantasies, grievances and intimate details that make up roughly
half of ``Let's Talk About Sex'' cover much of the same salty
territory as the recent and far more stylish HBO serial ``Sex and
the City.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Beyer, who plays Jazz, also wrote and directed this
entertaining hodgepodge of quasi-documentary, soft-core porn, sex
farce and psychobabbling soap opera. The movie zigzags jarringly
back and forth between snippets of video interviews, soft-core
fantasies accompanied by lush music and the roommates' stormy,
overacted personal dramas.
</P>
<P>
   Jazz has recently broken up with a man to whom she is still
deeply attached and who still loves her. The issues that divide
them include her shaky self-esteem, due to her infertility and her
urge to overcompensate by mothering everyone. Michelle has been
rejected by so many boyfriends (as well as by her recently
re-married mother) that she has developed a hard cynical shell. The
voluptuous Lena is a desperately willing doormat for the studly
musician who drops by at 4 a.m. for hot sex, then stands her up
when she coerces him into making a dinner date.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, ``Let's Talk About Sex'' feels like three
different movies crudely pasted together into a confusing mishmash
that can't distinguish between soft-core exploitation, raunchy
comedy and serious character study.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    CLINTON SUPPORT SAGS EVEN AT HIS ALMA MATER
 &HT;    BY NICHOLE MONROE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Disappointment over President Clinton's conduct in
the Monica Lewinsky scandal extends even to students at his alma
mater, Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   Many students said the president's credibility is crippled, but
they disagreed on whether he had committed an offense that
warranted his removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   Mathematics major Elizabeth Marshall said she has always
questioned the president's character.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see him impeached, even though it may be
devastating for the country right now, `` said Marshall, 21. ``It
would let the American public take a look at their morals and set
an example that says this isn't right.''
</P>
<P>
   In light of the fact that Clinton has stressed in the past
national family values and morality, even supporters said they were
disappointed in the president. Some took issue more with how he
handled the accusations than with his ``inappropriate
relationship'' with the former white house intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first apology, he never really said the words, 'I'm
sorry,''' said Chris Martinez, 21. ``It sends out a horrible
message to a young person that it is OK to lie and later say I'm
sorry. What's sad is that he's the most visible member of our
alumni and there are other alumni out there that are in politics
that are doing good things.''
</P>
<P>
   Some students said although the president's relationship with
Lewinsky may have been ``self-destructive,'' they think the
president's personal life was intruded upon. Some questioned
whether a lie about a private matter could be considered a crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though it was in the white house, what he does in his
spare time is no one's business,'' said Himanshu Kothari, 19. ``The
fact that he did it then lied about it does make him lose his
credibility, and that's the main concern above all.''

`FREE TIBET': GOOD CAUSES DON'T ALWAYS MAKE GOOD FILMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.) 
(JT) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As good causes go, surely Tibet ranks high among those who
cherish liberty. Since the early 1950s, the country's nonviolent
culture has been subjugated by China, which ended less than 40
years of Tibetan independence and reasserted claims of sovereignty
that extended back several centuries. As a result, the Dalai Lama
lives in exile in India with thousands of refugees. And Buddhist
monks and nuns attest to imprisonment, torture, beatings, rapes and
executions by the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   But good causes do not always make good films. The latest
illustration of that proposition is ``Free Tibet,'' a documentary
that must be judged as a lightweight, candy-coated introduction to
its subject.
</P>
<P>
   The film, directed by Sarah Pirozek, is built around the Tibetan
Freedom Concert, said to have drawn more than 100,000 people to
Golden Gate Park in San Francisco over two days in June 1996. With
popular performers like A Tribe Called Quest, Beastie Boys, Bjork,
Foo Fighters, Fugees, John Lee Hooker, Pavement, Rage Against the
Machine, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Sonic Youth, the idea was not
simply to entertain but to heighten awareness of the situation in
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Free Tibet'' intersperses snippets of performance, moshing and
other crowd reactions with an educational narration, historical and
contemporary film clips, interviews with the Dalai Lama and
survivors of imprisonment and brutality, and comments by the
musicians and members of the audience. The film is a production of
the Milarepa Fund, described in publicity material as ``the
nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting nonviolence and
compassion that was founded by Erin Potts and Beastie Boys' Adam
Yauch.''
</P>
<P>
   But torn between the music and its cause, ``Free Tibet'' is
unlikely to fully satisfy those who seek it out for either
entertainment or enlightenment. It is understandably filled with
the testimony and sentiments of partisans because it aims to
mobilize American opposition to repression in Tibet as powerful as
that applied to apartheid in South Africa. But the film lacks a
dispassionate yet informed voice to shed meaningful light on the
geopolitics of its subject.
</P>
<P>
   Worse yet, the well-meaning musicians who lend their talents to
the consciousness-raising concert display a woeful lack of
eloquence and coherence when given the opportunity on film to rally
support.

   SPIELBERG LOOKS TO THE EAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Steven Spielberg is known for his versatility and
range of interests, underscored by the fact that his latest movie,
``Saving Private Ryan,'' is an emotionally wrenching and extremely
violent World War II drama. But his choice of subject matter for
his next movie marks quite a new turn.
</P>
<P>
   He will be directing ``Memoirs of a Geisha,'' the story of a
young woman's rise in prewar Japan from a virtual slave to one of
Japan's most successful and influential masters of entertainment, a
geisha.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called me within a week of my buying the rights to the book
and he just said he wanted to do it,'' said Douglas Wick, who will
be one of the producers of the movie, being made for Columbia
Tri-Star Pictures. ``It was all the story. It was a gut thing for
him. It's a kind of Cinderella story.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that from the first meeting, Spielberg had precise
ideas of what he wanted to do. ``He envisioned it so clearly from
the start,'' Wick said. ``He knew exactly what he was doing.''
Spielberg was traveling in Europe and unavailable for comment, a
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Relative unknowns have been cast for the key parts in the film.
Playing the lead role will be Rika Okamoto, a dancer with the
Martha Graham Dance Company in New York. Another important part
went to Julyana Soelistyo, who has appeared on Broadway in David
Henry Hwang's ``Golden Child.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie is based on the novel of the same name, by Arthur
Golden, in which the famous geisha recalls her story, in the
process tracing the outlines of Japanese society and culture in the
1930s and then telling how World War II began to alter life.
</P>
<P>
   There are few cultures more complex than Japan's, particularly
the rarefied world of political and sexual intrigue within Gion,
the old entertainment district of Kyoto. But Wick said the
emotional drama translated into any culture.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Bass, the highly regarded and prolific screenwriter of ``My
Best Friend's Wedding'' and ``The Joy Luck Club,'' among other
films, is developing the script for the movie. It is expected to
begin filming in January, in the United States and Japan, with a
moderate budget of about $45 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bass said an attraction for him was that the tale delves into
one of the most arcane and idiosyncratic facets of Japanese
society, yet still relies on universal emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all seems so foreign, but once you get into the hearts and
souls of the people, you recognize all the emotions and feelings,''
Bass said. ``I'm talking about among the most fundamental longings
of the human heart. We ultimately believe we are all the same
underneath.''
</P>
<P>
   MIXED NEWS AT BOX OFFICE
</P>
<P>
   This was a somewhat confusing summer at the box office. Overall,
it was the biggest summer on record, with gross ticket sales rising
16 percent from last year, a very significant jump, to $2.58
billion, according to Exhibitor Relations, which tracks movie
sales.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, nine movies, more than at any time in the past,
cleared the $100 million mark, compared with six last year.
</P>
<P>
   But no films cleared $200 million, while two _ ``Men in Black''
and ``The Lost World'' _ did last summer. And not a whole lot of
this year's movies made much money. Indeed, the most expensive
films of the year, ``Armageddon,'' which took in $192 million, and
``Godzilla,'' which took in $135 million, may eke out little if any
profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Armageddon'' cost roughly $200 million to produce and market,
as did ``Godzilla.'' ``I think the lesson is you can get people
into the theaters for a week or two with hype, but you can't fool
them for long,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor
Relations.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's silly. Among the big surprises were ``There's
Something About Mary,'' a ribald comedy that cost about $25 million
and has earned $130 million, and ``Dr. Dolittle,'' a whimsical
comedy starring Eddie Murphy, which cost around $60 million and has
earned $140 million. Both were from 20th Century Fox, which won the
summer sweepstakes at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   And contrary to the adage that audiences just want light
entertainment in the hot months, ``Saving Private Ryan,'' a
wrenching World War II drama, also scored big. The movie, which
cost about $65 million to make, has taken in $167 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in this age of uber-marketing which we're in, the
audiences really are emotionally driven,'' said Tom Rothman,
president of film production at 20 Century Fox. ``When movies move
them or really make them laugh, the audience doesn't care what it
cost. The media cares. The audience doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say that Fox believes that small is always
beautiful. The studio is already preparing its uber-marketing
strategy for what could be next summer's blockbuster, the prequel
to the ``Star Wars'' cycle, from George Lucas. ``We believe there's
a place for size and spectacle,'' Rothman said.
</P>
<P>
   For the year as a whole, the studios have seen their overall
fortunes move sharply. Paramount, a middling performer in previous
years, was No. 1, according to Exhibitor Relations, with $928
million at the box office, largely on the success of ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   Buena Vista, Disney's film distribution arm, was second with
$639 million, followed by Fox with $625 million. Disney's total
jumped to $861 million if the sales of its Miramax division are
added in.
</P>
<P>
   Sony Pictures Entertainment, which led the pack last year,
tumbled to fourth, with $598 million, and the biggest loser was
Universal Studios, which crashed to ninth place, earning just
$196.8 million.

<P>
   CAR CHASES GALORE
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Claude Lagniez grows nostalgic at times about the Cold War.
No, he does not miss a Europe rent in two, the deadly spy games
between the Americans and the Soviets, the world on the brink of a
real war, the vilification of leftists. What he misses, he says, is
the cinematic Cold War _ those scenes of narrow European streets,
with spies screaming down them in fast cars in pursuit of, say, a
mysterious suitcase.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry. For the first time in years, Hollywood has
rediscovered that old battleground, giving Lagniez (above), the
stunt coordinator of the new film ``Ronin,'' a chance to give
audiences a world-class, high-speed car chase through the middle of
an ancient European town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronin,'' which stars Robert De Niro, Jean Reno and Jonathan
Pryce, and will be released by MGM on Sept. 25, seems unlikely to
win any Oscars, according to early reviews, but the movie delivers
several car chases that are something of a throwback. These are not
the romps on wide freeways or with leaping cars found in, for
example, ``Lethal Weapon 4'' or ``Speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Without a Ford or a Chevy muscle car in sight, ``Ronin'' offers
chases through streets in Nice, France, little wider than the
Citroens, Audis and BMWs that Lagniez used.
</P>
<P>
   Even viewers who get little thrill from watching cars career
across wide American streets may get a frisson from watching one
major, high-speed chase through French road tunnels _ against the
flow of traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Some 150 drivers were used, Lagniez, himself an accomplished
race car driver, said. The cars went as fast as 120 miles per hour
in the stunts and about 80 cars were wrecked in the scenes, in
which whole sections of Nice and roadways in Paris were closed down
temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   A number of the scenes in which the chase was against the flow
of traffic took place in the tunnels of Les Halles in Paris, and
required shutting them down for several nights, Lagniez said.
</P>
<P>
   All this may not be surprising, considering that ``Ronin,'' an
infinitely complex tale of double-crosses and double-double-crosses
in pursuit of that suitcase, was directed by John Frankenheimer,
who also directed ``The Manchurian Candidate,'' one of the
better-known Cold War dramas, and ``Grand Prix,'' about some feisty
European race car drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never cheats on the speed,'' said Lagniez of
Frankenheimer's insistence that they not film the scenes at
moderate speed and then speed them up. ``Working with him was like
a dream for me.''

FAVORITE SHOW CANCELED? DON'T WORRY. ACTORS WILL SOON SHOW UP
AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm vegging out in front of the tube, laughing uncontrollably at
the overacting of a puffy-haired Jason Priestley in the sitcom
``Sister Kate'' when a promo for ``Our House'' appears and there's
Priestley's former ``Beverly Hills, 90210'' mate, Shannen Doherty,
snarling back at me.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Doherty needle poor old Wilford Brimley in this family
drama (about a widow, her three children and the father-in-law they
bug endlessly) got me wondering about Doherty's return to
television this fall in ``Charmed''
</P>
<P>
   _ along with Holly Marie Combs, who played that smart-as-a-whip
daughter on ``Picket Fences''
</P>
<P>
   _ and Alyssa Milano, who will soon exit ``Melrose Place,''
having made her reputation as the overprotected daughter on ``Who's
the Boss?''
</P>
<P>
   _ with Tony Danza, who came to fame in ``Taxi'' and cemented his
small-screen stardom in ``Boss?'' and nearly uncemented it in the
romantic comedy ``Hudson Street''
</P>
<P>
   _ with Lori Laughlin, who had just exited ``Full House'' after
being overshadowed by that cute little entertainment corporation,
</P>
<P>
   _ Ashley and Mary-Kate Olsen, who are back this fall with ``Two
of a Kind'' on Fridays on ABC _ the network which aired Danza's
``Boss?'' for eight seasons.
</P>
<P>
   All this got me to thinking: Given that network execs often make
decisions out of paralyzing fear, it's understood that not only do
concepts get recycled, but so do people.
</P>
<P>
   This is nothing new, of course. After ``I Spy,'' Bill Cosby rode
herd on ``The Bill Cosby Show'' and later ``The New Bill Cosby
Show,'' and later ``Cos,'' and later the ``Cosby Show,'' which
leads us to ``Cosby,'' currently airing Monday nights on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   He's matched only by Bob Newhart who was on ``The Bob Newhart
Show'' and later ``Newhart'' and later ``Bob'' and later ``George &AMP;
Leo'' with Judd Hirsch, who had starred in ``Dear John'' but came
to fame in ``Taxi,'' bringing us back, once again, to Danza.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why it seems as though only a dozen or so people work in
TV: The batch of reruns we digest on a daily basis on cable,
independent stations and local network affiliates constantly remind
us that shows get the ax or simply burn out. But the stars in them
live on _ usually in another sitcom or drama the next season, and
often in roles similar to the ones they just departed.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, I turn over to Black Entertainment Television and
there's Brandy Norwood of ``Moesha'' playing yet another smart,
independent teen in the family sitcom ``Thea,'' which also featured
her ``Moesha'' co-stars Countess Vaughn, Marcus T. Paulk AND Yvette
Wilson in recurring roles, and starred Jason Weaver, who now plays
the same shady opportunist on ``The Smart Guy,'' which co-stars
Tahj Mowry, whose real-life sisters, Tia and Tamera of ``Sister,
Sister,'' play daughters to Tim Reid, who created and starred in
``Frank's Place'' after starring as Venus Flytrap on ``WKRP in
Cincinnati'' with Loni Anderson, who had a messy divorce from Burt
Reynolds, star of ``Evening Shade,'' whose spinoff starred Maria
Canals, who would end up as the computer whiz assistant on ``The
Tony Danza Show,'' bringing us back to our guy Tony.
</P>
<P>
   Just as durable: Debra Messing, who stars as Grace in buddy
comedy ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' who was in ``Prey'' after two seasons on
the comedy ``Ned and Stacey'' with Thomas Church, the bizarre
mechanic from ``Wings,'' who was joined by Greg Germann as Ned's
weird dim-bulb buddy whom we now love as the weird
philosophy-spouting attorney on ``Ally McBeal,'' which co-stars
Lisa Nicole Carson as the take-no-mess roommate who moonlights as
the take-no-mess mother of Eriq La Salle's kid on ``ER,'' which
stars the charming doctor George Clooney, who was a charming
newspaper columnist in the film ``One Fine Day'' with Michelle
Pfeiffer, who happens to be married to David E. Kelley, creator of
``Chicago Hope'' and ``Picket Fences'' and ``Ally McBeal,'' which
last season supplied a juicy recurring role for Tate Donovan as
Ally's squeeze around the same time he was Jennifer Aniston's lust
muffin on the sitcom ``Friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Donovan is now on the new NBC drama ``Trinity,'' but three
seasons back he was on the buddy sitcom ``Partners'' with Jon
Cryer, who's now the best thing about ``Getting Personal,'' even
with Vivica A. Fox and Duane Martin, who were once paired in ``Out
All Night'' with Patti LaBelle (who wisely headed back to singing),
and with Morris Chestnut, whose ``C-16'' drama featured Angie
Harmon, the new female district attorney on ``Law &AMP; Order'' trying
to change her rep, having created it as a ``Baywatch'' babe.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is also trying to live down her appearance in that stinker
of a ``sitcom,'' ``The Arsenio Hall Show'' with, well, Arsenio
Hall, who can also be traced to Danza, as the actor was a guest on
Hall's late-night talker two times _ three if you count the
appearance where he just popped out and did a soft-shoe tap dance.
</P>
<P>
   If this teaches us anything, it's that Danza may not be in the
fall lineup, but give him time. He's probably in a meeting right
now pitching his new sitcom: ``Danza.''

<P>
   The typical supermarket produce section has grown by a factor of
about four in the past 15 years. Where there was once spinach,
there are now kale, bok choy and half a dozen other greens for
cooking. Where there were all-purpose potatoes, there are now Yukon
gold, little red and several more.
</P>
<P>
   Many people find this overwhelming, but the truth is that
cooking vegetables is simple. Of course, you need to identify the
vegetable and know the general rules for preparing it. But once
you've done that, there's not much more you need to do to put a
nicely finished vegetable dish on the table.
</P>
<P>
   Few vegetables cannot be simmered or steamed to tenderness and
then lightly dressed, with something as simple as lemon juice or
vinaigrette. And few vegetables cannot be cooked in a little olive
oil, either over high heat so that they become crisp, or with some
liquid, covered, over lower heat, so that they become meltingly
tender.
</P>
<P>
   If you buy super-fresh, super-high-quality vegetables, you can
give them the minimalist treatment and they'll be singing with
enough flavor to please even a vegetable hater.
</P>
<P>
   Most vegetable haters are simply vegetable lovers who haven't
realized it yet. These dishes can move the process along.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STIR-FRIED BROCCOLI &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (makes 4 servings)
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes
</P>
<P>
   You need not precook the broccoli for this stir-fry, but if you
have leftover or extra simmered or steamed broccoli, by all means
use it. Just keep the cooking time to a minimum, no longer than it
takes to heat the broccoli through.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; About 1 1/2 pounds broccoli, trimmed &QL; 
 &UR; 2 tablespoons peanut (preferred) or other oil &QL; 
 &UR; Salt to taste &QL; 
 &UR; 1 teaspoon sugar &QL; 
 &UR; 1 cup chicken, beef or vegetable stock, or water &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cut the stalks of the broccoli into thin slices. Separate the
florets into small sections.
</P>
<P>
   Place the oil in a wok or large, deep skillet over medium-high
heat. Two or three minutes later, add the broccoli, raise the heat
to high and cook, stirring, until it becomes bright green and
glossy and begins to brown, about 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Add the salt, sugar and stock or water. Stir and continue to
cook until almost all of the liquid evaporates and the broccoli is
tender, about 5 minutes more. Serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; QUICK-BRAISED CARROTS WITH ORANGE AND GINGER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (makes 4 servings)
</P>
<P>
   Time: about 20 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Best with butter, but still delicious when made with oil. Simply
cooked carrots are good spiked with spices. In addition to ginger,
try ground cardamom, cinnamon, cumin or coriander.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1 pound carrots, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices &QL; 
 &UR; 2 tablespoons butter or 1 tablespoon canola or other neutral oil &QL; 
 &UR; 1/4 cup orange juice &QL; 
 &UR; 1 tablespoon minced orange zest &QL; 
 &UR; 1 teaspoon sugar or 1 tablespoon maple syrup &QL; 
 &UR; Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste &QL; 
 &UR; 1 tablespoon peeled and minced fresh ginger &QL; 
 &UR; Minced fresh parsley, mint, chervil or cilantro leaves for garnish &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Place the carrots, butter or oil, orange juice, orange zest,
sugar, salt and pepper in a medium saucepan over high heat; bring
to a boil and cover. Turn the heat to medium-low and cook for 5
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Uncover and raise the heat a bit. Add the ginger. Cook, stirring
occasionally, until the liquid has evaporated and the carrots are
cooking in butter or oil. Lower the heat and continue to cook,
stirring occasionally, until tender, a couple of minutes longer.
</P>
<P>
   Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary, then garnish and
serve.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OVEN-BAKED RATATOUILLE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (makes 4 servings)
</P>
<P>
   Time: About 1 1/4 hours
</P>
<P>
   Combining vegetables can turn a simple dish into a dramatic one
_ or even into a main course. This mixture of soft vegetables,
gently baked in layers until very tender, is sensational.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 10 cloves garlic &QL; 
 &UR; 2 large onions, thinly sliced &QL; 
 &UR; 2 large eggplant, about 2 pounds total, sliced 1/2-inch thick (If
time allows, salt both sides of the slices, let drain in a colander
for at least 30 minutes, rinse and squeeze dry between paper
towels.) &QL; 
 &UR; 4 red or yellow bell peppers, stemmed, peeled if desired, seeded
and sliced into 3 or 4 pieces each &QL; 
 &UR; 4 ripe red tomatoes, cored, skins and seeds removed, and cut into
thick slices &QL; 
 &UR; 1 teaspoon fresh thyme, rosemary or savory leaves &QL; 
 &UR; Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste &QL; 
 &UR; 2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley, basil or chervil leaves for
garnish &QL; 
 &UR; 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   Either of these techniques will make the garlic easier to peel:
Drop it into boiling water, leave it there for 30 seconds, then
remove. Or toast it in a dry skillet over medium heat, shaking
frequently, for 3 or 4 minutes. Peel and cut each clove in half.
</P>
<P>
   In a casserole, make a layer of onion, followed by one of
eggplant, peppers, tomatoes, herbs, salt, pepper and garlic cloves.
Repeat. Drizzle the ratatouille with the olive oil and place in the
oven.
</P>
<P>
   Bake for about an hour, pressing down on the vegetables
occasionally, until they are all completely tender. Garnish and
serve, hot or at room temperature.

`CUBE': NO MAPS, COMPASSES OR FAITH

  (Production notes at end) 
(JT)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One morning Quentin wakes up and he's not in his bed. Or anybody
else's. He's in an ugly, windowless 14-by-14-foot cube of a room,
dressed in a drab uniform he has never seen. Soon he discovers that
what he's in is a gigantic maze of interlocking cubes, that he has
six other equally clueless souls for company and that since there's
no food or water they had all better figure out how to get out of
there fast. Unfortunately, as they soon learn, many of the
surrounding rooms are booby-trapped in various clever ways. The
first man who goes into one is quickly sliced and diced. Another
man has his face burned off.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, this doesn't sound that promising as the premise of a
full-length film. But ``Cube,'' the story in question, proves
surprisingly gripping, in the best ``Twilight Zone'' tradition.
</P>
<P>
   The ensemble cast does an outstanding job on the cinematic
equivalent of a bare stage. Quentin (Maurice Dean Wint) is a police
officer who turns out to have a little too much of a take-charge
personality. Leaven (Nicole de Boer, of ``Deep Space Nine'') is a
high school math whiz whose talents, especially with prime numbers,
offer a way to save the day. Holloway (Nicky Guadagni) is a doctor
_ a psychiatrist, apparently _ who doesn't deal well with her own
stress. Worth (David Hewlett) is an architect who knows more about
the giant cube than he admits at first. Rennes (Wayne Robson) is a
professional criminal and escape artist who's not as smart as he
believes. Kazan (Andrew Miller) is an autistic man who thinks he's
Dustin Hoffman in ``Rain Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone has his or her own theory about who is behind this
peculiar imprisonment. ``Let's rule out aliens for now,'' Quentin
replies to one person's abduction theory, adding his own thought:
``It's some rich psycho's entertainment.'' Holloway blames the
military-industrial complex (``Only the government could build
something this ugly''). They never learn the full truth.
</P>
<P>
   The weakness in ``Cube'' is the dialogue, which sometimes turns
remarkably trite. Quentin's tirade at Holloway, in which he
characterizes her as ``dried up,'' doesn't have an original thought
in it. And Worth actually says at one point, ``I have nothing to
live for out there.'' The strength is the film's understated but
real tension.
</P>
<P>
   Vincenzo Natali, the film's fledgling director and co-writer,
has delivered an allegory, too, about futility, about the necessity
and certain betrayal of trust, about human beings who do not for a
second have the luxury of doing nothing.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCTION NOTES
</P>
<P>

and Graeme Manson; director of photography, Derek Rogers; edited by
John Sanders; music by Mark Korven; production designer, Jasna
Stefanovic; produced by Mehra Meh and Betty Orr; released by

 FROM ``HOW TO COOK EVERYTHING'' by MARK BITTMAN  
 Copyright 1998 Mark Bittman

<TEXT>
<P>
   Many Americans are reluctant to buy and cook fish for
themselves. We currently eat twice as much fish in restaurants as
at home, a statistic which becomes even more impressive when you
consider that it includes the fish most commonly prepared by home
cooks: canned tuna.
</P>
<P>
   Fish is different from other animals we eat for one main reason:
60 or more kinds, on a rotating basis, make common appearances in
the supermarket. This makes fish confusing for many.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a feature of fish that makes the cooking much
easier than it would be otherwise: Many fish are so similar that
they can be readily substituted for one another.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the following fish fillets have much in common.
They are all stark-white, or nearly so, mild-flavored and under an
inch thick. All are tender, some more than others. The sturdier
ones (marked with a + ) can be substituted in the recipes that work
for the more tender ones.
</P>
<P>
   + Catfish
</P>
<P>
   + Dogfish, also known as cape shark
</P>
<P>
   Flatfish of any type: flounder, fluke, sole, dab, plaice
</P>
<P>
   Haddock (likely to have skin on, but skin is edible)
</P>
<P>
   Large- or small-mouthed bass (freshwater)
</P>
<P>
   Pickerel (freshwater)
</P>
<P>
   Pike (freshwater)
</P>
<P>
   Ocean perch
</P>
<P>
   + Red snapper, or other snappers
</P>
<P>
   + Rockfish of any type
</P>
<P>
   + Sea bass
</P>
<P>
   Weakfish, also known as sea trout
</P>
<P>
   + Wolffish, also known as ocean catfish
</P>
<P>
   Whiting, also known as hake
</P>
<P>
   These fish cook very, very quickly and overcook almost as fast.
How do you know when they're done? Several ways:
</P>
<P>
   1. By the time the outside of the thinner fillets is opaque, the
inside is very nearly done. This is absolutely true if you turn the
fish over, as you do in a pan. But even in a broiler or oven,
external opacity is a sign of internal doneness.
</P>
<P>
   2. With thinner fillets, when the thinnest part flakes, the
thicker part is done. When the thicker part flakes, it's
overcooked.
</P>
<P>
   3. With thicker fillets, those up to one inch or so, you can
roughly estimate doneness by timing: about 8 minutes is the longest
you want to cook any fillet under one inch thick. In addition, take
a peek between the flakes of the fish; if most of the translucence
is gone and the fish is tender, it's done.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXTRA-CRISP RED SNAPPER (OR OTHER FILLETS) WITH APPLES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (makes 4 servings)
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes
</P>
<P>
   This is a lovely combination, typical of the simple fish dishes
of northern France. It's best with red snapper or other sturdy
fillets.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 4 crisp not-too-sweet apples, such as Granny Smiths &QL; 
 &UR; 6 tablespoons butter &QL; 
 &UR; Flour for dredging &QL; 
 &UR; Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste &QL; 
 &UR; 1 egg &QL; 
 &UR; 4 red snapper or other sturdy fillets, about 6 ounces each, scaled
or skinned
 &UR; Plain bread crumbs for dredging &QL; 
 &UR; 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice &QL; 
 &UR; 1 tablespoon brandy (optional) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Peel and core the apples, then cut them into rings or thin
wedges. Melt half the butter in a medium skillet over medium heat.
Add the apples, raise the heat to medium-high, and cook, tossing
and stirring occasionally, until nicely browned on all sides, about
7 minutes. Keep warm in a 200 degrees Fahrenheit oven while you
proceed with the recipe.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've started cooking the apples, preheat a large
non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Season the flour with salt
and pepper and beat the egg in a bowl. Add the remaining butter to
the skillet and, when the foam subsides, dredge each fillet in the
flour, then dip it in the egg, dredge it in the bread crumbs, and
place it in the pan.
</P>
<P>
   Cook until the fillets are nicely browned on both sides, about 6
to 8 minutes total. The fillets will be white, opaque and tender
when done.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the fish to a platter. Drizzle the apples with lemon
juice and brandy and spoon a portion onto each fillet. Serve
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``OVEN-FRIED'' CATFISH (OR OTHER FILLETS)
</P>
<P>
   (makes 4 servings)
</P>
<P>
   Time: 25 minutes
</P>
<P>
   This is a 1950s-style recipe that takes almost no effort.
</P>
<P>
   Use this with any of the fillets listed above. Reduce the
cooking time to 4 to 5 minutes for those under 1/2 inch thick.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; About 1 1/2 pounds catfish or other fillets, scaled or skinned &QL; 
 &UR; 1 1/2 cups milk &QL; 
 &UR; Plain bread crumbs for dredging &QL; 
 &UR; Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste &QL; 
 &UR; 3 tablespoons melted butter or olive oil &QL; 
 &UR; Lemon wedges &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Soak the fillets in the milk while you preheat the oven to 500
degrees Fahrenheit. Season the bread crumbs with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   When the oven is hot, dredge the still-wet fish in the bread
crumbs, patting them to make sure they adhere. Drizzle a little of
the butter over the bottom of a 9-by-13-inch baking pan, preferably
non-stick, then lay the fillets in the pan. Drizzle with the
remaining butter.
</P>
<P>
   Bake near the top of the oven for about 8 minutes; the fish will
be tender and opaque when done. Serve immediately, with lemon
wedges.

   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `THE AVENGERS,' starring Uma Thurman, Ralph Fiennes, Sean
Connery and Eileen Atkins. Directed by Jeremiah Chechik (PG, 100
minutes). Sometimes major movie studios should be afraid to screen
expensive fiascoes for the press, but they go ahead anyway. ``The
Avengers'' is Warner Brothers' would-be blockbuster that actually
had its light hidden beneath a bushel until opening day, and no
wonder. With pseudo-suave repartee that would make Austin Powers
blush and with so many shades of ``Howard the Duck'' that one scene
depicts man-size pastel teddy bears sitting around a conference
table, it's a film to gall fans of the old television series and
perplex anyone else. I can't remember another Friday morning show
where I heard actual cries of ``Ugh!'' on the way out the door
(Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `BLADE,' starring Wesley Snipes, Stephen Dorff, Traci Lords and
Kris Kristofferson. Directed by Stephen Norrington (R, 120
minutes). Vampires are plotting to take over the world, and the
only person who can save the planet is a vampiric half-human
superhero named Blade. So much fake blood drips, gushes, explodes
and congeals in this hyperkinetic science-fiction horror film
adapted from a popular comic book that there's barely a scene that
isn't drenched in red. Snipes' Blade is a low-rent Arnold
Schwarzenegger imitation dressed in a ludicrous mixture of black
leather and what look like car seat belts. There's lots of morphing
and Hong Kong action movie-style acrobatics. Dorff is the bratty
leader of the young vampire rebels. The visuals are garish, the
acting wretched (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `DANCE WITH ME,' starring Vanessa L. Williams, Chayanne and Kris
Kristofferson (PG, 126 minutes). A likable mess of a movie, ``Dance
With Me'' wants to be the ``Saturday Night Fever'' of salsa
dancing, and in the smoldering-eyed young Puerto Rican star
Chayanne it has found a charismatic Latino answer to John Travolta.
But the story of an ambitious young Cuban who works in a Houston
dance studio run by a man who may or may not be his biological
father ( Kristofferson) meanders so much that the movie never
gathers dramatic momentum, and the dance sequences are hopelessly
choppy and poorly framed. Even a percolating Latin American score
and a winning performance by Ms. Williams as the object of
Chayanne's affection can't hold the pieces together (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `54,' starring Ryan Phillippe, Salma Hayek, Neve Campbell, Mike
Myers, Lauren Hutton and Michael York. Directed by Mark Christopher
(R, 89 minutes). Mark Christopher's botched-up history of Studio
54, the notorious late-70s disco and celebrity hangout, should have
been a depraved Manhattan answer to ``Saturday Night Fever.''
Instead, it is a juiceless mishmash that can't decide whether it's
a nightclub history, a comedy ( Myers' crude ``Saturday Night
Live''-style caricature of Steve Rubell) or a contemporary
variation on the fable of the prodigal son. Phillippe, playing a
19-year-old Jersey City nobody who ascends from busboy to star
bartender at the club, does throw off an occasional spark. But the
movie is so afraid to confront the character's self-promoting
bisexuality that he never really comes alive (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `FIRELIGHT,' starring Sophie Marceau and Stephen Dillane.
Written and directed by William Nicholson (R, 103 minutes). Stella
Dallas meets Jane Eyre in this high-toned Victorian-era
bodice-ripper about a beautiful Swiss governess (Ms. Marceau) who
is hired by a married English aristocrat to bear a child when his
wife is unable to conceive. Years later, she tracks him down and
becomes the governess to his spoiled young daughter who doesn't
know that her teacher is also her biological mother. Using flash
cards, she tricks the intransigent little brat into learning to
read, among other good deeds. Ms. Marceau and Dillane strike
sparks, and the movie's canny mixture of sex and suds makes for
slick, low-grade ``Masterpiece Theater''-style entertainment
(Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `THE GOVERNESS,' starring Minnie Driver and Tom Wilkinson.
Directed by Sandra Goldbacher (R, 114 minutes). It is the early
1840s, and Rosina (Ms. Driver), a headstrong young Sephardic Jewish
woman living in London, poses as a Gentile to get a job as a
governess for the Cavendish family on a remote Scottish island.
Falling in love with the skittish, devoutly Christian head of the
household (Tom Wilkinson), a gentleman inventor with whom she has a
stormy affair, she becomes his collaborator in the invention of
photography. The ravishingly handsome film works on several levels:
as a proto-feminist fable, a meditation on still photography and
its relation to real life, and a portrait of lovers whose religious
difference becomes an unbridgeable emotional gap. Ms. Driver holds
the picture with a solid performance that falls short of great
(Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `HOW STELLA GOT HER GROOVE BACK,' starring Angela Bassett, Taye
Diggs and Whoopi Goldberg. Directed by Kevin Rodney Sullivan (R, 99
minutes). This silly soft-core fantasy in which 40-year-old Stella
(Ms. Bassett) meets and falls in love with 20-year-old Winston (
Diggs) while on vacation in Jamaica is part Caribbean travel
brochure (fly to Jamaica and meet the hunk of your dreams) and part
diluted Chippendales-in-the-Caribbean strip show floated on a
bathtub full of suds with some light comedy thrown in. Ms. Bassett
brings real fire to the role of a beautiful divorced-with-one-son
San Francisco stockbroker whose resistance to romance is broken
down in the tropics. But Diggs' nearly perfect boyfriend is a vapid
romance-novel fabrication. Ms. Goldberg shamelessly stirs up the
suds as Stella's raunchy best friend, who is secretly dying of
liver cancer (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `A MERRY WAR,' starring Richard E. Grant and Helena Bonham
Carter. Directed by Robert Bierman (not rated, 101 minutes).
Skillfully adapted from George Orwell's satirical 1936 novel,
``Keep the Aspidistra Flying,'' the witty period piece, set in
1930s London, follows the descent into poverty of Gordon Comstock
(Grant), a successful London ad man who quits his copywriting job
to be a full-time poet. The subjects skewered include young artists
with delusions of grandeur and snobbish aristocrats with Socialist
pretensions. Ms. Bonham Carter is Gordon's sweetheart who patiently
waits out a narcissistic seizure that Grant portrays with an
engaging comic buoyancy (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `NEXT STOP WONDERLAND,' starring Hope Davis and Alan Gelfant.
Directed by Brad Anderson (R, 111 minutes). Will Erin (Ms. Davis),
an attractive, introspective night-shift nurse, and Alan (
Gelfant), a plumber and aspiring marine biologist who was obviously
meant for her, collide on the streets of Boston and live happily
ever after? The set-up of this romantic comedy about dating in the
90's may seem cliched, but the witty, beautifully acted and edited
film refreshes the genre with the acuteness of Anderson's
observations about people and middle-class urban life in general.
Ms. Davis creates a wonderfully complex portrait of an idealistic
introvert coping with loneliness, disappointment and pressures from
all sides, including (in the movie's funniest scenes) some ardently
self-centered suitors who answer a personal ad. A rich Brazilian
bossa-nova score gives the movie exactly the mood of bittersweet
longing (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `SAVING PRIVATE RYAN,' starring Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, Tom
Sizemore, Jeremy Davies, Edward Burns and Adam Goldberg. Directed
by Steven Spielberg (R, 168 minutes). Spielberg's soberly
magnificent new film is the finest war movie of our time. Turning
back the clock to restore passion and meaning to the genre, he
works in a spirit of urgent communication to look at war as if it
had not been looked at before. Tour-de-force battle scenes are
frank without sensationalism, and the same great storyteller who
made you believe there was an extraterrestrial hiding in the closet
has made this an irresistibly vibrant, gripping tale. Hanks
continues to astonish with admirable modesty, and the rest of the
casting is comparably inspired. As he did with ``Schindler's
List,'' Spielberg has made a landmark film of devastating power
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY,' starring Cameron Diaz, Ben
Stiller and Matt Dillon. Directed by Peter and Bobby Farrelly (R,
119 minutes). Sometimes Western civilization declines in
deliriously funny style. Hence this proudly obnoxious comedy is a
hoot in every sense, deserving a smidgen of disapproval and a whole
lot of helpless laughter. Set in motion by a prom, a crush and a
cruel, cruel zipper, this paean to low humor works ridiculously
well because it never stoops to being mean-spirited or (despite all
appearances) authentically inane. The principal cast is bright and
appealing, with Ms. Diaz at her most beautiful and blithe. Do note
that this film strives hard for something to offend everyone, and
that a tolerance for the Farrellys' zit jokes is unfortunately
required (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `WESTERN,' starring Sergi Lopez and Sacha Bourdo. Directed by
Manuel Poirier (not rated, 121 minutes). What a tenderhearted
delight is ``Western,'' the best-kept secret in town. Don't be put
off by that misleading title: Poirier's road movie is actually set
in western France, where two funny and hapless outsiders wind up
joining forces and embarking on a wonderfully droll journey. The
story begins when a salesman from Spain is outsmarted by a wily
little Russian hitchhiker. It's an introduction that hardly has the
makings of a beautiful friendship. But that's exactly what develops
in a funny, romantic film filled with cozy intimacies and lovely,
wide-screen images of the French countryside. Looking for love,
these two lonely travelers find it in the most sweetly
unpredictable ways. Audiences are liable to fall in love, too
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `WHY DO FOOLS FALL IN LOVE,' starring Larenz Tate, Halle Berry,
Vivica A. Fox and Lela Rochon. Directed by Gregory Nava (R, 112
minutes). In this raucous comic ``Rashomon'' of rock 'n' roll, the
brief, meteoric career and busy, turbulent marital life of the
singer Frankie Lymon ( Tate) furnish the pretext for a trip through
time to the 1950s and 60s, when much of a generation fell under the
spell of a new kind of music. At its best, this uneven but often
entertaining movie, written by Tina Andrews, manages to recapture
some of the excitement and turmoil of those days, revel in high
spirits and low-down humor and provide a happy sampler of hits. At
its most mediocre, it is built around a farcical battle for Lymon's
estate among three women (Ms. Berry, Ms. Fox and Ms. Rochon), each
claiming to be his wife and the heir to his royalties. Lymon's
career may have been short and sad, but ``Why Do Fools Fall in
Love'' finds the melodrama of his life in the exciting music of his
time and the tumult of his romances (Lawrence Van Gelder).
</P>
<P>
   `YOUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS,' starring Jason Patric, Ben
Stiller, Aaron Eckhardt, Catherine Keener, Amy Brenneman and
Nastassja Kinski. Written and directed by Neil LaBute (R, 100
minutes). Three men obsessed with one another's sexual performance
are at the core of this second film from the director of ``In the
Company of Men.'' The new movie is so blunt at times, and so
unrelievedly talky and dark at others, that it cries out for the
velvet glove of ``Manhattan,'' a much more seductive film about
sexual opportunism and urbane cruelty. Yet even when LaBute's
material feels mannered or unremittingly sour, it sustains a
psychic ferocity that commands attention. The intricate web of
lies, failures and brutal revelations here is strong stuff, and
it's the work of an original filmmaker who takes no prisoners
(Maslin).

`BIRDS OF AMERICA': AND WHAT HAVE THEY DONE WITH THEIR LIVES? 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In one of Lorrie Moore's earlier books, a character describes a
flock of birds: ``From four blocks away, I could see that the flock
had a kind of group-life, a recognizable intelligence; no doubt in
its random flutters there were patterns, but alone any one of those
black birds would not have known what was up. Alone, as people
live, they would crash their heads against walls.''
</P>
<P>
   Those poor feathered creatures, of course, are stand-ins for Ms.
Moore's own characters _ lost, lonely people fumbling their way
through life, banging their heads against walls, their hearts
against old sorrows, as they migrate from relationship to
relationship, home to home.
</P>
<P>
   In Ms. Moore's resonant new collection of stories, ``Birds of
America'' these people are slightly older than their predecessors
in ``Self-Help'' and ``Like Life,'' more conscious of the rumble of
mortality beneath the shiny formica surface of daily life.
</P>
<P>
   They still make jokes all the time _ to ward off hurt and
disappointment _ but there is something sadder and wearier about
these characters, a realization, as they drift toward middle-age,
that ``every arrangement in life'' carried with it the shadow ``of
its not being something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the writer-heroine in one of these stories, Ms. Moore is a
skilled craftsman, capable of doing ``quasi-amusing phone
dialogue,'' ``succinct descriptions of weather'' and ``screwball
outings with the family pet'' with her left hand. The stories in
this volume, however, also attest to far deeper gifts. They attest
to Ms. Moore's ability to map the emotional landscape of people in
transition, people who have run smack up against the limits and
limitations of their lives, people who feel themselves to be
outsiders in their own families and marriages.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these people are actually exiles of sorts: on the lam,
on vacation or simply on the road, in search of someone or
something that's been missing in their daily lives. One story
follows the peregrinations of a homosexual couple _ ``two more lost
boys in America'' _ as they traverse the country, trying to shuck
their sense of homelessness, even as their own relationship
founders and threatens to come apart.
</P>
<P>
   Another story chronicles a trip to visit the magical Blarney
Stone in Ireland made by a disaffected woman and her mother, and
their realization that the ``dares one made oneself commit didn't
change a thing'' _ ``they were all a construction of wish and
string and distance.''
</P>
<P>
   As in Ms. Moore's earlier stories and novels, many of the
characters in this volume are women trapped in _ or abruptly
ejected from _ shopworn relationships. High strung, self-conscious
and more than a little caustic, they tend to be vaguely artistic or
literary types, who take up with men they patronizingly regard as
being more comfortable coping with the trivialities of daily life,
men who read ``Auto Week,'' sell real estate or yogurt, men who do
not feel ``demeaned or trivialized'' by discussions about lawn
mowers and grass clippings and storm windows.
</P>
<P>
   Abby marries Bob after her dog, Randolph, dies of kidney
failure, and ``marriage to Bob seemed the only way to overcome her
grief.'' Sidra continues seeing an auto mechanic named Walter, even
though she has already extrapolated the doomed arc of their
relationship in her head: ``She would yell; then he would yell. He
would have an affair; then she would have an affair.'' And Agnes
marries Joe, a realtor 12 years her senior, only to find that her
life now resembles a glass of water: ``half-empty, half-full.
Half-full. Oops: half-empty.''
</P>
<P>
   Acutely aware of her characters' obsession with their own
emotional temperatures, Ms. Moore can be devastatingly funny about
their self-absorption and their awareness of their self-absorption.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Beautiful Grade,'' the yuppie guests at a New Year's Eve
party prattle on to one another, trading brittle quips with cynical
asides. What should they do in the minutes before the new year
actually arrives? ``We'll contemplate our fruitful work and great
accomplishments,'' one guest sighs. ``Though, of course, when you
think about Gandhi, or Pasteur, or someone like Martin Luther King
Jr., dead at 39, it sure makes you wonder what you've done with
your life.'' Another guest protests, ``We've done some things.''
Like what? Like: ``We've ... had some excellent meals. We've ...
bought some nice shirts. We've gotten a good trade-in or two on our
cars _ I think I'm going to go kill myself now.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moore can be equally savage in sending up the academic
pretensions of the world so many of her characters inhabit (perhaps
the reason ``Birds of America'' shares a title with Mary McCarthy's
1971 novel, not to mention Audubon's famous pictorial survey): ``I
read Lacan,'' one woman says, ``I read `Reading Lacan.' I read
``Reading `Reading Lacan.'' ' ''
</P>
<P>
   Yet at the same time, Ms. Moore also grapples, in these stories,
as she has sometimes been reluctant to do in the past, with the
real sadness and grief in her characters' lives. Two of them have
siblings with serious, intractable illnesses. One of her heroines
has had to live with the knowledge that she accidentally killed a
friend's baby; another has learned that her own baby is suffering
from a rare form of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Though these stories might sound in summary like
movie-of-the-week scenarios, Ms. Moore writes with such
psychological precision, such sharp, unsentimental knowledge of her
characters' hopes and fears that she's able to invest these
melodramatic situations with a heartfelt understanding of the
precariousness of everyday life, its unexpected losses and terrors.
</P>
<P>
   At once sad and funny, lyrical and prickly, ``Birds of America''
not only reaffirms Ms. Moore's virtuosic skills as a writer, but
also attests to the deepening emotional chiarascuro of her wise and
beguiling work.

BRAZIL GETS A CLOSE WATCH IN GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Sept. 13)   (EDS: Filed in ``w'' and ``f'' and ``i'' categories)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Economists and government officials anxiously
surveying the global economic crisis are watching Brazil because of
concern that a currency devaluation there could throw Latin America
into recession and ultimately slow the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three major Latin American economies _ Brazil, Argentina
and Mexico _ Brazil is considered the most vulnerable to the
economic turmoil now engulfing Asia and Russia because of its large
federal budget deficit, a payments imbalance and huge government
debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil not only is the biggest of the three, not only is it
the one that all of South America is dependent on, but it has the
biggest deficiencies,'' said Lawrence Krohn, managing director for
research at Chase Securities in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are telling investors now that the risks have increased
tremendously over the last few weeks in Brazil,'' said Krohn.
``There is a structural vulnerability that makes Brazil a logical
target.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian government is attempting to fix those problems, in
particular the bulging budget deficit that is 7 percent of the
country's gross domestic product (GDP) _ and growing.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency said in its most recent
assessment of Brazil's economy that the country has made
significant fiscal reform to encourage free markets and foreign
investment. But it warned that high debt levels and budget deficits
were ``contributing to federal and state budget problems and a
surge in bankruptcies.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming on the heels of currency collapses in Asia and Russia,
investors are taking their money out of Brazil _ and other emerging
markets.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Sao Paulo stock exchange _ Latin America's
largest market _ lost nearly 40 percent of its value in August. On
Sept. 3, Brazil's market dipped by 8.6 percent, its second worse
daily loss ever. And the Brazilian government paid some $12 billion
in cash reserves as investors cashed in holdings of domestic
currency, the real, for U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Although Brazil's robust $1.02 trillion economy dwarfs Russia's
$767 billion economy, both nations suffer similar problems: big
federal budget deficits and high domestic debt.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, the Yeltsin administration devalued the ruble after
the government defaulted on debt obligations, and investors lost
confidence that the government could correct the problems. The
Russian stock market lost much of its value in the melee.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Malaysia's recent decision to impose government
controls on the flow of capital has made investors nervous that
Brazil might follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The devaluation in Russia, combined with capital controls in
Malaysia, have caused a severe loss of confidence by Brazilian
investors in their own currency,'' said Jorge Mariscal, manager of
Latin American equity investments for Goldman Sachs in Brazil.
``We've got a very serious situation right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's problems are putting pressure on the government to
devalue the currency in order to stem the flow of capital.
</P>
<P>
   A currency devaluation would provide the temporary benefit of
making Brazil's exports less expensive on world markets. A
devaluation is considered a government's last resort to keep
investors from trading in domestic currency for U.S. dollars. The
main benefit is to make it more costly to give up the local
currency which then is worth less relative to the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Mariscal says prospects for devaluation of the real are growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``A month ago, I would have said there was less than 10 percent
chance of devaluation. The chances now have maybe tripled,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian government has repeatedly said that it will not
devalue the currency. Rodrigo Santos, the head of financial policy
at the Brazilian Embassy in Washington, said the government is
making a major effort to cut the budget deficit and restore
investor confidence. Brazil also has raised interest rates to
provide an incentive for investors to stick with their Brazilian
holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's leaders are trying to keep the currency stable, at
about 1.18 reals for a dollar, even as holders of locally
denominated securities such as government bonds sell them to buy
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, such a sell-off would drive down the value of the
real. But Brazil has spent cash reserves of about $1.3 billion a
day for the last two weeks buying up domestic currency that
individuals, banks and company treasuries are unloading.
</P>
<P>
   A dramatic devaluation in Brazil would have ``an horrendous
impact'' across the region, said Krohn.
</P>
<P>
   It would unleash inflation because the cost of imports would
shoot up dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   It would lead currency speculators to sell off currency holdings
in Argentina ``and from there Mexico could get caught in the fall
out,'' Krohn said.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of Argentina, which has a GDP of about $296 billion, is
closely linked to that of Brazil. The two are major trading
partners, with Brazil being Argentina's top export market; about 26
percent of Argentina's exports go there.
</P>
<P>
   If the Brazilian government devalued its currency, the real
would be worth less and therefore could buy fewer imports. That
would hurt Argentina's economy and put pressure on Argentine
officials to devalue the peso.
</P>
<P>
   Any devaluation in Brazil would pinch the United States because
Brazil would be able to afford fewer U.S. products. In 1997, Brazil
imported about $15.9 billion worth of American goods, a 25 percent
jump compared with 1996. The U.S. exports included automobiles,
computers, electronics and computer software.
</P>
<P>
   If economic unrest spread beyond Brazil to Argentina, Mexico and
other nations in Latin America, $133 billion in annual U.S. exports
could be at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Latin American leaders warned as much last week when they met
for a economic summit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There exists a very serious worry in each of our countries
from what has occurred in these past weeks,'' Mexican President
Ernesto Zedillo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this continues, we would be at risk of the entire world
economy entering a state of recession,'' he said.

HOME VIDEO: SMALL GEMS AMID THE BIGGIES; NEW RELEASES

   Small Gems Amid the Biggies
</P>
<P>
   Perusing video release schedules for the fall and winter, one
finds an unusually large number of finely realized little films
scattered among the more ham-fisted blockbusters. Parity may not be
the word, but about a dozen critically praised and well-attended
art-house movies are about to stage the same kind of modest
breakout on videotape that they had during generally solid runs in
theaters this spring and summer.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them come from so-called art-film divisions of big
studios that are willing to give their better-performing little
movies a nod even while stoking the fortunes of their
mega-properties.
</P>
<P>
   As a case in point, Columbia Tri-Star will release ``Godzilla''
in November, but before and after will come three highly regarded
films from the studio's Sony Pictures Classics division.
</P>
<P>
   The first, to be released Oct. 6, is David Mamet's ``Spanish
Prisoner,'' which has spent 23 weeks in theaters and earned nearly
$10 million. The film stars Campbell Scott as a bemused scientist
who invents a formula, called the Process, that could make him
rich, only to see it whisked out from under his nose by the
unscrupulous Jimmy Dell (Steve Martin). Or so it appears. No one
knows anything for sure in ``The Spanish Prisoner,'' but it's
certainly the kind of movie many people will catch up with on
videotape.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true of ``The Opposite of Sex,'' to be released by
Columbia Tri-Star on Oct. 27. Don Roos' rambunctious little film
ran all summer in theaters, earning a respectable $6 million and
quite a reputation for Dedee Truitt (Christina Ricci), a
trash-mouthed, boot-leather-tough 16-year-old who sets a cross
section of men, gay and heterosexual, on their ears, makes light of
her pregnancy and shoots holes in the ceiling to get people's
attention.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Columbia Tri-Star will release Hal Hartley's ``Henry
Fool,'' about a repressed garbageman whose writing, when it finally
emerges from his basement apartment, has a profound effect on
everybody who reads it. (``You brought on my period a week and a
half early, so just shut up!,'' complains the woman who typed the
manuscript.) ``Henry Fool'' earned better reviews than receipts at
the box office (about $1.2 million), but it will make splendid
video fare.
</P>
<P>
   Other very good smaller films _ Whit Stillman's ``Last Days of
Disco'' (Polygram, Oct. 13), Lisa Cholodenko's ``High Art''
(Universal, Dec. 15), Christopher Scott Cherot's ``Hav Plenty''
(Miramax in December) _ will clear breathing room for themselves
among releases like ``The X-Files'' (Fox, Oct. 13) and
``Armageddon'' (Touchstone, Nov. 13).
</P>
<P>
   And on Oct. 20, Home Vision will release ``Picnic at Hanging
Rock,'' Peter Weir's 1975 film, based on a true story and
considered something of a small classic, about the mysterious
disappearance of three Australian schoolgirls and their teacher.
For various reasons, the tape has been off the video market for 15
years. Displeased with the editing when the movie was made, Weir
re-edited the new version to his liking. Presumably there'll be no
such adjustments to ``The Truman Show,'' his large new title due
from Paramount this winter.

   1998. Warner. $104.16. 117 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13.
Release date: Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sent to pluck a soul to eternity, a mush-hearted sad-sack of an
angel called Seth (Nicolas Cage, left) falls in love with the
surgeon Maggie (Meg Ryan). To pursue his infatuation, Seth
materializes, but in the person of Cage he looks more like a serial
killer than a heavenly agent. Ms. Ryan survives in character as a
starchy, no-nonsense type, but the rest of Brad Silberling's film
goes flying off into a slick blue yonder of high California gloss.
Adapted from Wim Wenders' loopily poetic ``Wings of Desire,'' the
movie, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times, ``is so busy
being seriously romantic that it forgets the poetry.''

   1998. Touchstone. $104.16. 134 minutes. Closed captioned. R.

   Loaded with bold urban landscapes, Spike Lee's film takes to the
basketball court for a seesaw battle of father-and-son
reconciliation. Jake Shuttleworth (Denzel Washington) can get
himself paroled from Attica if he persuades his son, Jesus (Ray
Allen), the country's best high-school player, to attend a college
favored by the governor of New York. Jesus, however, detests his
father for the accidental killing he committed. As the two of them
parry, basketball schools ply Jesus with sex and Porsches. Although
Lee doesn't limit himself to narrowly focused storytelling, ``what
he has here is an explosion of spectacular gambits and a great
high-concept hook'' (Janet Maslin). &QL;

<P>
   1998. Paramount. $102,56. 96 minutes. Closed captioned. R.

   Paul Newman adds richness to a classic genre as Harry Ross, an
aging Los Angeles gumshoe caught in the resurfacing of an old
murder case with ties to a time gone forever. A boarder in the
Hollywood home of Jack and Catherine Ames (Gene Hackman and Susan
Sarandon), Harry falls for Catherine but is drawn into the
mysteriously convenient disappearance of her husband years before
when she first met Jack. Teeming with talent, Robert Benton's film
ultimately belongs to Newman, who ``inhabits his shrewd,
world-weary character with the ease that only lifelong movie
stardom can bring'' (Maslin).

<P>
   `DEEP RISING'
</P>
<P>
   1998. Hollywood. $104.16. 107 minutes. Closed captioned. R.

<P>
   Out to sink his own $487 million cruise ship (for the insurance
money), Canton (Anthony Heald) dispatches a band of mercenaries to
doom the craft on its maiden voyage. Ferrying the raiders out to
the ship, a skipper named Finnegan (Treat Williams) finds the big
vessel floating aimlessly about, boards it with the mercenaries and
finds its entire complement of passengers, save one comely survivor
(Famke Janssen), slurped up by strange creatures of the deep who
have sucked them dry and left the skeletons. And the slimy critters
are still on board, so it's time to find the lifeboats in a
``ridiculous but energetic movie'' (Lawrence Van Gelder).
</P>
<P>
   Other new titles of interest, some of which may have had a
theater release at one time or appeared on television.
</P>
<P>
   `THE EXORCIST.' The 25th-anniversary edition of William
Friedkin's seminal horror film, starring Linda Blair and Ellen
Burstyn, includes interviews, an introduction by Friedkin, a
30-minute documentary about the making of the film, 11 minutes of
outtakes and the original theatrical trailer. 1973. Warner. $19.98
or $49.98 for the film in a wide-screen version with a longer
documentary and a CD with the soundtrack (available Oct. 6). 120
minutes. R.
</P>
<P>
   `AMERICAN GRAFFITI.' Also 25 this year, George Lucas' film about
small-town teen-agers in 1962, starring Harrison Ford, Ron Howard
and Richard Dreyfuss, was drawn from the director's own hot-rodding
days in Modesto, Calif., and modeled after Nicholas Ray's classic
``Rebel Without a Cause.'' The anniversary edition has interviews
with Lucas; the producer, Francis Ford Coppola, who offered to buy
the film when the studio at first balked at releasing it, and most
of the principal actors. 1973. Universal. $19.98 for standard and
wide-screen versions. 112 minutes. PG. Release date: Tuesday.

   `FRANK SINATRA: OFF THE RECORD.' ``When I say no, I mean no, but
for some reason it still persists,'' Sinatra told Walter Cronkite
during their interview on CBS on Nov. 16, 1965. The singer was
referring to his alleged connections with the mob, with which he
acknowledges he might have had some dealings while building a hotel
in Las Vegas. Other topics include his responsibility to his fans:
``The only thing you owe the public is a good performance,'' he
says. CBS Video. $14.98. 45 minutes.

BRAZIL GETS A CLOSE WATCH IN GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Sept. 13)   (EDS: Filed in ``w'' and ``f'' and ``i'' categories)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Economists and government officials anxiously
surveying the global economic crisis are watching Brazil because of
concern that a currency devaluation there could throw Latin America
into recession and ultimately slow the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three major Latin American economies _ Brazil, Argentina
and Mexico _ Brazil is considered the most vulnerable to the
economic turmoil now engulfing Asia and Russia because of its large
federal budget deficit, a payments imbalance and huge government
debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil not only is the biggest of the three, not only is it
the one that all of South America is dependent on, but it has the
biggest deficiencies,'' said Lawrence Krohn, managing director for
research at Chase Securities in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are telling investors now that the risks have increased
tremendously over the last few weeks in Brazil,'' said Krohn.
``There is a structural vulnerability that makes Brazil a logical
target.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian government is attempting to fix those problems, in
particular the bulging budget deficit that is 7 percent of the
country's gross domestic product (GDP) _ and growing.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency said in its most recent
assessment of Brazil's economy that the country has made
significant fiscal reform to encourage free markets and foreign
investment. But it warned that high debt levels and budget deficits
were ``contributing to federal and state budget problems and a
surge in bankruptcies.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming on the heels of currency collapses in Asia and Russia,
investors are taking their money out of Brazil _ and other emerging
markets.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Sao Paulo stock exchange _ Latin America's
largest market _ lost nearly 40 percent of its value in August. On
Sept. 3, Brazil's market dipped by 8.6 percent, its second worse
daily loss ever. And the Brazilian government paid some $12 billion
in cash reserves as investors cashed in holdings of domestic
currency, the real, for U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Although Brazil's robust $1.02 trillion economy dwarfs Russia's
$767 billion economy, both nations suffer similar problems: big
federal budget deficits and high domestic debt.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, the Yeltsin administration devalued the ruble after
the government defaulted on debt obligations, and investors lost
confidence that the government could correct the problems. The
Russian stock market lost much of its value in the melee.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Malaysia's recent decision to impose government
controls on the flow of capital has made investors nervous that
Brazil might follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The devaluation in Russia, combined with capital controls in
Malaysia, have caused a severe loss of confidence by Brazilian
investors in their own currency,'' said Jorge Mariscal, manager of
Latin American equity investments for Goldman Sachs in Brazil.
``We've got a very serious situation right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's problems are putting pressure on the government to
devalue the currency in order to stem the flow of capital.
</P>
<P>
   A currency devaluation would provide the temporary benefit of
making Brazil's exports less expensive on world markets. A
devaluation is considered a government's last resort to keep
investors from trading in domestic currency for U.S. dollars. The
main benefit is to make it more costly to give up the local
currency which then is worth less relative to the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Mariscal says prospects for devaluation of the real are growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``A month ago, I would have said there was less than 10 percent
chance of devaluation. The chances now have maybe tripled,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian government has repeatedly said that it will not
devalue the currency. Rodrigo Santos, the head of financial policy
at the Brazilian Embassy in Washington, said the government is
making a major effort to cut the budget deficit and restore
investor confidence. Brazil also has raised interest rates to
provide an incentive for investors to stick with their Brazilian
holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's leaders are trying to keep the currency stable, at
about 1.18 reals for a dollar, even as holders of locally
denominated securities such as government bonds sell them to buy
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, such a sell-off would drive down the value of the
real. But Brazil has spent cash reserves of about $1.3 billion a
day for the last two weeks buying up domestic currency that
individuals, banks and company treasuries are unloading.
</P>
<P>
   A dramatic devaluation in Brazil would have ``an horrendous
impact'' across the region, said Krohn.
</P>
<P>
   It would unleash inflation because the cost of imports would
shoot up dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   It would lead currency speculators to sell off currency holdings
in Argentina ``and from there Mexico could get caught in the fall
out,'' Krohn said.

GOVERNMENT REPORT CRITICIZES HANDLING OF FOOD INSPECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Imported fruits, vegetables and seafood supposedly
inspected by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration are rarely
examined and shipments declared unsafe often find their way back
into American markets, the General Accounting Office reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weak and inconsistently applied controls have allowed some
FDA-regulated imported foods that violate U.S. food safety
requirements to enter domestic commerce,'' said Lawrence J.
Dyckman, director of food and agricultural issues for the GAO, the
investigative arm of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Dyckman, who testified Thursday before the Governmental Affairs
Committee's permanent subcommittee on investigations, also said FDA
inspectors physically examined only 1.7 percent of the 2.7 million
entries of imported food under its jurisdiction in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   He said one problem is that importers, rather than the FDA, keep
the food in their warehouses during the inspection process,
enabling them to switch good products for bad, or reroute
contaminated products into the United States that are supposed to
be re-exported or destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Dyckman said, the U.S. Customs Service and the FDA
have failed to coordinate efforts to ensure that tainted products
don't enter the United States, and penalties for violating
inspection and disposal requirements are too low or not imposed.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report cited a San Francisco Customs and FDA operation
known as Shark Fin, which began in October 1996, and found that
importers had diverted trucks headed to inspection stations so they
could replace tainted products with acceptable ones. The operation
revealed that six importers were sharing the same ``acceptable''
product when they had to present a shipment for inspection in a
practice known as ``banking.''
</P>
<P>
   A July 1997 San Francisco sting operation, called Operation Bad
Apple, found that 40 of 131 importers committed violations such as
switching products or wrongly identifying them.
</P>
<P>
   Last year in New York, Customs officers found that some
importers had substituted garbage for contaminated products that
were supposed to be re-exported, or that importers had actually
re-exported only a small portion of the tainted products.
</P>
<P>
   At several ports, the GAO report said, Customs officials didn't
check rejected shipments to verify if they were being re-exported
or destroyed, and the FDA didn't mark shipments to show they have
been declared unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   Richard J. Hoglund, a deputy assistant commissioner for the
Customs Service, told the Senate panel that the service had
investigated and convicted people in connection with fraud and
deception in cases including decayed Chinese shrimp, filthy food
from South Korea and contaminated rice sticks from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA has said in the past that it does not have sufficient
inspectors to cover every port.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Susan M. Collins, R-Maine, who chaired the hearing, said
the new GAO report highlights a disturbing problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unsafe food contaminated with dangerous pathogens is
distributed in this country in part because of weak import
controls, poor coordination among federal agencies and low
penalties for violating food safety regulations,'' she said.
``That's unacceptable. We simply have to have a better system in
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard J. Durbin, D-Ill., said the FDA inspection system
was ``overwhelmed'' because the agency has 309 hands-on inspectors
posted at 330 ports of entry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have fewer inspectors than ports,'' Durbin said. ``Why do
we have a problem? That's why.''
</P>
<P>
   A former Customs broker, who testified for the panel behind a
screen to hide his identity, said unscrupulous importers often move
tainted goods from port to port until they find one lax enough to
accept the goods.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the penalties for bringing unsafe food into the
country are ineffective because they are too low or aren't imposed.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had witnessed many cases in which Customs officers
have lowered penalties from $300,000 to $100.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most penalties are just written off as the cost of doing
business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's hearing was the third in a series on food safety.

 &HT;    BIPARTISAN CAMPAIGN FINANCE BILL DIES IN SENATE
 &HT;    Eds: In Cox states, all Democratic senators supported the bill
and all GOP senators voted to kill it.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - Prospects for adoption this year of new campaign
finance laws collapsed Thursday when a key vote in the Senate broke
apart the coalition pushing for a bipartisan bill.
</P>
<P>
   Needing 60 votes to stop a filibuster against an amendment that
contained a bipartisan reform plan, the coalition led by Sens. John
McCain, R-Ariz., and Russell Feingold, D-Wis., shattered after it
came up eight votes short.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Feingold had hoped to pick up new supporters after
the House's overwhelming approval last month of a similar proposal
to ban big, unregulated gifts to political parties and regulate
pre-election ads.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday, the Senate vote was identical to a 52-48 vote
that blocked action on the same bill last March. While seven
Republican and 45 Democratic senators backed the plan, the same 48
Republicans voted once again to kill it.
</P>
<P>
   McCain then abandoned the attempt for the year, though Feingold
vowed to soldier on.
</P>
<P>
   As McCain withdrew his amendment from the Interior Department
spending bill, he said, ``I am reluctant, without progress on this
issue, to engage in a debate that could divert the Senate from
important issues of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Feingold, however, declared that ``the amendment will be offered
again on this bill and, if necessary, on other bills, until it is
done.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said, ``If we hang tough here and not
withdraw in the face of a filibuster, we can succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCain said it had become impossible to raise enough public
pressure to convince the 48 GOP hold-outs to change their mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's diverted by the president's problems,'' McCain
said. ``All the oxygen has been sucked out of the room by this
firestorm.''
</P>
<P>
   He warned that if the supporters kept trying to attach the
McCain-Feingold bill to other legislation, Majority Leader Trent
Lott , R-Miss., could ``really make this place a less pleasant
place to work.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, McCain said, Lott is ``prepared to do things'' such
as offering to amend the McCain-Feingold bill to add a clause like,
``No president shall have relations with an intern.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott congratulated McCain on his decision to wait until next
year. Senate Democratic leaders stayed away from the floor, rather
than encourage Feingold and Levin to carry on. That showed that
they too were willing to let the bill die.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he expected little political fallout from the
failure of the 20-month drive by him and Feingold for a bipartisan
bill. He noted wryly, `` ``The front pages of tomorrow's newspapers
will probably not highlight the fact that we have failed once again
to adopt campaign finance reform.''

`TESS OF THE D'URBERVILLES': STRAIGHTFORWARD, FAITHFUL AND A BIT
PLODDING 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.) 
 (af)  
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thomas Hardy, one of the last great Victorian novelists, didn't
die until 1928, well into the age of movies. And as early as the
1870s his novels displayed qualities that seem ready-made for the
screen: the picturesque rural backdrop, inspired by the Dorset
countryside where he was born in 1840; drama so outsized it verges
on melodrama; characters so complex, so trapped by fate and social
convention that they still speak passionately to us today.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy's last novels _ ``Tess of the D'Urbervilles'' in 1891 and
``Jude the Obscure'' in 1895 _ are the work of a man with one foot
in the 19th century and another in the 20th, with its rapidly
changing world and especially its sexual double standard for men
and women.
</P>
<P>
   Those contemporary, cinematic elements are abundant in the novel
``Tess,'' the tale of a young village woman who is taken advantage
of by a rich man, bears a child who dies in infancy and later loses
her true love because she is honest about her disreputable past.
Tess' short history builds to murder and a tragic end played out in
the theatrical setting of Stonehenge.
</P>
<P>
   That story remains irresistibly compelling in the new two-part
adaptation of ``Tess'' on A&AMP;E. The storytelling, however, is
straightforward, faithful and a bit plodding. This staid version
lacks the spark of creative energy that makes a film live. Above
all, it lacks a dynamic Tess.
</P>
<P>
   Justine Waddell looks the part, with a pretty country-girl
freshness. But Tess' moral confusion and tortured emotions always
seem just beyond her grasp. Though it is true that Tess is batted
about by fate, she shouldn't seem so flat a character. (Consider
how much Nastassja Kinski's irregular beauty and natural
performance brought to Roman Polanski's ``Tess'' in 1979; along
with John Schlesinger's 1967 film ``Far From the Madding Crowd,''
it remains the most enduring adaptation of Hardy.)
</P>
<P>
   Built around Ms. Waddell's thin performance, the new ``Tess of
the D'Urbervilles'' is an ordinary movie best enjoyed for several
powerful isolated elements. It has much visual beauty and two
appealingly energetic yet modulated performances, by Jason Flemyng
as the caddish Alec D'Urberville and Oliver Milburn as Tess'
pure-minded love, Angel Clare.
</P>
<P>
   Tess' tragedy is set in motion when her irresponsible father,
Jack Durbeyfield, learns that he is descended from an ancient,
aristocratic family named D'Urberville. Sent to meet those rich
supposed relations (in fact, social upstarts who took the
D'Urberville name), Tess meets Cousin Alec and goes to work as a
family maid.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy actually made Alec a dark villain with a curled mustache,
but Flemyng provides a more human and appealing aspect, without
losing those flashes of brutality that make him hateful. And the
intelligent screenplay captures Hardy's clear-sighted ambiguity
about relations between the sexes.
</P>
<P>
   On a foggy night in the woods, Alec is escorting Tess home from
town, rescuing her from her drunken companions. Tess is half asleep
as Alec begins to seduce and finally rape her. Her attraction to
him allows her to feel responsible, to hate herself, as she later
says, ``for my weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   Tess blames herself; that may be the essence of her tragedy. But
Hardy saw Tess as blameless, a wildly unconventional attitude at
the time. The subtitle, ``A Pure Woman,'' made the novel a scandal
when it first appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the film, the book's philosophical remarks are
incorporated by an unseen Hardeyesque narrator. He says of Tess,
``She had broken the laws of society but in her feelings of guilt
and distress she believed that she had broken the laws of nature
itself.'' Yet instead of reflecting Hardy's tone, these asides add
a pedantic air.
</P>
<P>
   More comfortably, Milburn makes the fair-haired Angel sincere
and conscience-driven without being precious. He truly loves Tess,
yet finds it hard to forgive her past. Ms. Waddell comes closest to
capturing her character's inner turmoil when she is struggling
about what to tell Angel.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the drama of Alec and Angel's characters remains more
fascinating than Tess', with Alec going through a religious
conversion and Angel rejecting Tess, only to have the men revert to
their true natures in the end.
</P>
<P>
   Visually, the film includes some stunning tableaux, including a
scene in which Tess lies on the ground and stares at the stars. The
rich atmosphere ranges from scenes of harvesting to the grand house
of the D'Urbervilles.
</P>
<P>
   The film's many strengths cannot make up for this Tess'
emotional slightness, though. ``Too late,'' she tells Angel when he
returns near the story's end. She sounds a little sad, when the
line should carry all the heaviness of their star-crossed fate. &QL;

SAN FRANCISCO MAYOR HINTS THAT NEW STADIUM MAY BE DEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHUCK FINNIE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mayor Willie Brown, still without a commitment
from the San Francisco 49ers for a new stadium, said he wouldn't
wager the price of a fancy cup of coffee that the project would be
built.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the stadium is a distinct possibility,'' Brown said,
hedging, then added: ``I would not bet a cafe mocha with raspberry
and sugar on this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's dour forecast, delivered Wednesday after meeting with
senior members of his staff, carried none of the optimism of his
earlier assessments.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was issued with the knowledge that for Brown, the
demise of the project would be a heavy blow to his mayoral legacy.
Brown has been a major supporter of the stadium project.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor is scheduled to meet Sept. 18 with 49ers President
Larry Thrailkill and National Football League Commissioner Paul
Tagliabue to discuss the stadium. Brown said he wanted to see the
new cost estimates that are leading the team to say the project
might be too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the facts are. I hope somebody supplies me
with some information that they seem to have before the meeting
takes place so we can at least have a healthy dialogue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he doubted estimates that the stadium would cost
$500 million. ``That makes no sense, in my opinion, but I don't
want to prejudge it. I want to look at the numbers,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed, 75,000-seat 49ers stadium, under a deal cut by the
Brown administration and the team, was supposed to cost $325
million.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Washington Redskins opened a 78,600-seat stadium
that cost $175 million. The San Francisco Giants organization,
which is building a waterfront baseball park, estimates its costs
at about $300 million for 42,000 seats.
</P>
<P>
   A $100 million city subsidy for the 49ers project is contingent
on private development of a shopping and entertainment complex next
door to the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Quentin Kopp of San Francisco said that if the
stadium and commercial center unravel, it would be another case of
empty promises coming back to haunt the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire undertaking, including construction costs, was
presented with its best face on it,'' said Kopp, a Brown foe who
opposed a 1997 ballot measure that approved the public subsidy for
the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is another example of the mayor's misrepresenting
of facts and likely occurrences to the people of San Francisco,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke Tuesday, Brown was still smarting from not being
told in advance that Thrailkill was going public with the team's
concerns over estimates that showed skyrocketing construction costs
for the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   In other signs that the project may be dead, Joe Ellis, a top
NFL official who was supposed to head the 49ers stadium
development, accepted a similar post with the Denver Broncos. And
no date has been set for publication of an environmental impact
report on the stadium and commercial project. That report was
supposed to be finished this month, city officials said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Let's get serious. The puppets are back in town.
</P>
<P>
   And they're not kidding around. (Well, all right, some of them
are.) Mostly, however, they are a breed apart, these blockheads of
the New York stage, displaying social consciences, historical
perspective, even a bit of literary sophistication. If it's not a
residue of guilt bequeathed by South Africa's apartheid regime that
they are laying bare, it's the persecution of Czech Jews or the
wartime desecration of a great European city. They are, by and
large, puppets with moral fiber.
</P>
<P>
   Manipulating dolls and other inanimate objects may still seem,
to many playgoers, an activity more suited to Saturday morning
television than a Saturday night out. But it's a sure bet that a
visit to virtually any of the 28 companies participating during the
next two weeks in the International Festival of Puppet Theater will
provide evidence of the amazing adaptability of contemporary
puppetry, and a corresponding vigorousness of purpose among those
who choose to tell stories _ big, mythic stories _ with their
hands.
</P>
<P>
   The biennial festival, organized by the Jim Henson Foundation, a
group dedicated to the memory of the Muppet master who made
puppet-viewing suitable for adults in search of wit in any of its
guises, brings together troupes from around the world _ Germany,
Japan, Colombia, Indonesia and Israel are among the nations
represented _ to show off the artistic breadth of the craft.
</P>
<P>
   Like floodlights suddenly turned on in undiscovered caverns, the
technical achievements in these shows often have an astonishing
effect on the imagination: what force, what mind, could account for
such startling shapes?
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the shapes are frequently the most intriguing
aspects of a puppet play; in the clash of form and language, the
sculpture, so painstakingly realized, sometimes seems to get the
best of the underdeveloped script.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one only has to be struck by an isolated moment, as in,
for instance, the vignette of the reluctant microphones in the
Handspring Puppet Company's bilious ``Ubu and the Truth
Commission,'' to grasp the expressive power in making ordinary
things behave in extraordinary ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ubu and the Truth Commission,'' which opened at the Joseph
Papp Public Theater on Wednesday, the festival's first night, is
one of those attempts at telling a big story. By turns grave and
acidic, the 90-minute piece is a catalog of the sins and terrors of
apartheid as embodied by two superior actors, Dawid Minnaar and
Busi Zokufa. They portray Pa and Ma Ubu, a malicious, complementary
pair _ he's serpentine, she's porcine _ who, like all architects of
atrocity, are such insidious maneuverers that no one ever sees them
pulling the strings.
</P>
<P>
   The puppets in ``Ubu,'' designed by Adrian Kohler and directed
by William Kentridge, are all supporting players in the events
leading to Pa Ubu's climactic testimony before the Truth
Commission, modeled on the actual Truth and Reconciliation
Commission that continues to hold hearings in South Africa on the
crimes committed under apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, in fact, the panel, meeting in Pretoria, heard a
former senior police official confess to his involvement in the
murders of dissidents by mail bombs. (And in an even stranger
mirror of the play, the day's hearings were cut short because of
faulty microphones.)
</P>
<P>
   Kohler's puppets, extreme examples of compassion or vitriol, are
as striking as the preserved bodies of the victims of Pompeii.
There is the touching sculptural realism of the various survivors
of apartheid violence. Each one testifies to the violent deaths of
loved ones, murdered by beatings or enveloped in the fiery ring of
a burning tire. And there are the scathing caricatures of villains.
Pa Ubu's lackeys are represented by a three-headed dog whose necks
are attached to a briefcase, a symbol of a bloody day's work.
</P>
<P>
   As in the chronicling of any unfathomable act of human
depravity, the unrelenting darkness of the play becomes a little
numbing. It's leavened only by the inventiveness of the mechanics,
and particularly in moments like the one in which Minnaar steps up
to a pair of microphones to offer his explanation for his actions.
Each time he tries to speak, however, the mounted instruments, in a
truly inspired bit, spin out of his reach or take a swing at him.
It's as if he wants to talk his way out of his predicament, and the
microphones simply won't hear of it.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible to attend the festival and leave at home the
plagues and sufferings of the real world, as is deliciously
demonstrated by Faulty Optic, a British puppet troupe with a
pronounced (and hilarious) weird streak. Its ``Bubbly Beds,'' also
at the Public Theater, is like a palm-size Monty Python skit that
answers the improbable question, ``What's living in the basement
with Auntie?''
</P>
<P>
   When the man of the house goes down to check out a severe
plumbing problem, he slithers into his scuba gear; the basement
scenes occur in an aquarium. (Like Basil Twist's ``Symphonie
Fantastique,'' the downtown puppetry hit, Faulty Optic _ with its
underwater world in miniature of working flashlights, oxygen masks,
ticking clocks and maiden aunts with the bodies of sturgeons _
displays nonpareil dexterity in the tank.)
</P>
<P>
   And the spooky sense of humor of its creators, Liz Walker and
Gavin Glover, is a perfect match for the macabre machinations.
</P>
<P>
   Their show runs through Sunday in tandem with Paul Zaloom's
``House of Horror,'' a silly puppet satire of life in the 'burbs,
but it's Faulty Optic's waterworld that provides the more potent
escape.

   ``Lock 25, Lock 25, Lock 25. This is the vessel Onondaga
requesting westbound passage. Over.''
</P>
<P>
   I felt silly, but what fun it was. Anyone traveling on the Erie
Canal in upstate New York must call ahead by two-way radio to the
laconic men and women operating the locks. Lock-tenders, as they're
unofficially called, report that canal amateurs tend to get
overexcited by the radio, as if reliving a childhood fantasy about
navigating a battleship. ``It's new to them,'' said Joe Pidgeon,
the lock-tender of the bucolic Lock 25 near Savannah, N.Y. ``You
can tell when they pull up to the lock, because they keep
chirping.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, my family and I piloted our own rented boat _ the
10-ton, 34-foot, very personable Onondaga _ for nearly 150 miles on
the Erie and Cayuga-Seneca Canals. Over five days we went from just
north of Syracuse to Seneca Falls to the edge of Rochester and
back. (Different kinds of boats are available for weekends.)
</P>
<P>
   We traveled at six miles an hour, ate and slept on the Onondaga,
and saw wilderness, sleepy courthouses and one wastewater treatment
plant. Not every sight was exquisite. But the clock slowed down,
and distances seemed much farther, just as they had in an earlier
century. Although we've lived in India and Japan, and have trekked
in Nepal, this turned out to be one of the most exotic things we
have ever done.
</P>
<P>
   The magic of the canal is not so much its remote stretches of
beauty, but the sensation it offers of traveling along an artery of
history. To float down the Erie Canal is to have an intimate
connection with the way it was built to be used.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the small towns we passed had remnants of the
19th-century mills that drove the industrial revolution and used
the canal to ship their goods. We were right down in the water,
where the power was.
</P>
<P>
   For years I have wanted to go to Seneca Falls, the site of the
first women's rights convention. To arrive there for the first time
by water _ to tie up our boat just below Wesleyan Chapel, where in
1848 Elizabeth Cady Stanton read the ``Declaration of Sentiments,''
demanding that women be given the vote _ made the journey more
personal and gave the town a lost-in-time feel (at least until a
group of 20th-century teen-agers turned up to drink in the park
right outside our boat).
</P>
<P>
   The 340-mile-long Erie, finished in 1825, was America's greatest
canal. Before the railroads and highways, it connected the Great
Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean as the crucial route for shipping the
crops and products of the Western states to the East. It did
nothing less than transform New York City into a commercial
superpower. Philadelphia had been the nation's chief seaport, but
two decades after the canal was finished New York was supreme.
</P>
<P>
   DeWitt Clinton, the New York City mayor and then New York
governor who spent a political career promoting the canal's
creation _ his dream was at first derided as ``Clinton's Ditch'' _
is today a visionary for what he imagined the canal would do for
New York. ``The city will, in the course of time, become the
granary of the world,'' he once wrote, ``the emporium of commerce,
the seat of manufactures, the focus of great moneyed operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Our adventure began at 7 a.m. on Saturday. The four of us _ my
husband, me and our two children, ages 8 and 4 _ drove the five
hours from our home in Westchester County to Cold Springs Harbour
Marina near the northern edge of Onondaga Lake, just above
Syracuse. After loading up with groceries, we boarded our boat for
an orientation by Carl Peterson, 17, of Mid-Lakes Navigation, the
largest and oldest boat rental company on the Erie.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson showed us around the barge, from the diesel engine to
the head and shower, then told us it was time to cast off. I put
the children in life jackets and undid the lines while my husband,
Steve Weisman, took the tiller under Peterson's eye.
</P>
<P>
   Steve has had some experience with boats, but not with a 10-ton
barge; the Onondaga, though easy to handle, took practice.
Amazingly, Mid-Lakes rents to complete novices, but it heartily
recommends that you take out $1 million in liability insurance. We
did that, through Mid-Lakes, for $75.
</P>
<P>
   While Steve practiced his turns in the canal, I unpacked and
looked over our new home. The boat was a marvel. A decade ago,
Mid-Lakes began building what it calls Lockmasters, modeled on
19th-century European canal boats, for recreational use on the
Erie. The Onondaga, one of the newest Lockmasters, had a steel
hull, with a metal exterior painted a pleasing red, gold and forest
green.
</P>
<P>
   Inside it looked like a floating Adirondack cabin with
light-pine paneled walls and braided rugs.
</P>
<P>
   There was a double bed, a sofa that turned into bunk beds for
the children at night and a small dining table with cushioned
benches up in the bow. In the kitchen was a two-burner stove, an
oven, a sink and a small refrigerator and freezer.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Wiles Wing manages the nine Mid-Lakes Lockmasters, and
she is a woman after my own heart. The Onondaga was not only
immaculate but obsessively well equipped, from a potato peeler to a
portable propane grill to a corkscrew to salt and pepper shakers.
There were even two bicycles strapped to the top deck.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson helped us through the first lock, No. 24, in
Baldwinsville. It wasn't that easy; while Steve steered the boat
through the gates and along the cement wall, I stood in the bow and
grabbed for one of the lines hanging from the top of the lock. (The
lines were covered with the most fantastic green slime I have ever
seen. Ms. Wing thoughtfully supplied rubber gloves.)
</P>
<P>
   Steve, in the stern, grabbed for a line, too. We held the
Onondaga parallel to the wall as the gates closed and millions of
gallons of water filled the lock. In minutes we were lifted up 11
feet. Then the gates in front of us opened, and out we glided. The
locks, 36 in all, are necessary because of the 568-foot rise in the
canal as it stretches west from the Hudson River to Lake Erie.
</P>
<P>
   We tied up alongside a cemetery in Baldwinsville, said goodbye
to Peterson, grilled some salmon for dinner, then went to bed and
slapped miserably at mosquitoes all night. We bought a can of Raid
the next day, and it saved us for the rest of the trip.
</P>
<P>
   We cast off Sunday at 10 a.m., marveling at the blue herons, the
red-tipped maple leaves and the labor of the 19th-century workers,
many Irish immigrants who fought malarial mosquitoes as they dug
the canal through the Montezuma Marsh, now the Montezuma National
Wildlife Refuge.
</P>
<P>
   We were not in the original Erie Canal, but the enlarged Erie
built after 1905, parallel to the first, which made use of existing
rivers and lakes. Even at that time, railroads had cut heavily into
the canal's traffic, and by the 1950s, the opening of the St.
Lawrence Seaway and the New York State Thruway made it obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Today the focus is on tourism. In a five-year plan, millions of
dollars in federal and state money is being spent to improve the
canal's locks, moorings and bike paths. In 1992, the legislature
created the Canal Recreationway Commission and renamed all four
interconnected canals in the state _ the Erie, the Cayuga-Seneca,
the Champlain and the Oswego _ as the New York State Canal System.
</P>
<P>
   We arrived in Seneca Falls by 6 p.m., and on Monday morning
toured Wesleyan Chapel and Stanton's home, where a park ranger,
Richard Pardee, told us that Stanton considered Seneca Falls an
``awful, mud-rutted town.'' I thought it was better than that, but
no doubt things have improved. By 2 p.m. we were back on the water,
headed west.
</P>
<P>
   The days fell into a nice pattern. We would cast off around 8
a.m., eat breakfast and lunch while under way, then anchor on a
quiet stretch in the hot afternoons for a swim. The water was
murky, a little creepy, but cold. I never saw anybody else swim in
the canal, except for a teen-age boy who jumped in 60 feet from the
top of a railroad bridge, screaming at the top of his lungs. (It
was a stunt, and he survived.)
</P>
<P>
   My husband was happy because he discovered he could read while
he drove the boat, although only half a page at a time; I navigated
from the detailed charts supplied by Mid-Lakes. I also became an
avid reader of the Onondaga's logbooks, which Mid-Lakes encourages
boaters to keep. Most log entries were about restaurants and birds
spotted along the way, but a few were soulful reflections from
boaters who suddenly had found time to think.
</P>
<P>
   ``Met lovely old man in Clyde,'' wrote a woman from Skaneateles,
N.Y., last year. ``Must have been 85-plus _ working his 5x10 store
after 63 years!! He's lonesome &AMP; wants to talk but can tell he
doesn't want to be inappropriate. We buy some stuff and linger _
hard to pull away. Hope we see him again _ he's a really lovely
human being. Working to stay alive, psychologically _ more power to
him. ... Testimony to the human spirit, like the canal.''
</P>
<P>
   We stayed Monday night in Lyons, and by Tuesday reached
Fairport, an affluent suburb of Rochester. We looked over the
Fairport Historical Museum, went on a walking tour of some
19th-century Greek revival and Italianate homes, had dinner at the
Green Tavern and went to bed in a thunderstorm.
</P>
<P>
   Fairport has revitalized its canal front, and it's spiffy, but
it also felt like an upscale mall. It would be awful if every canal
waterfront looked the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning we turned back toward home, reaching Lock No.
25, and Pidgeon, its lock-tender, by dinner time. It was six more
hours to Cold Springs Harbour Marina, so we decided to stay
overnight. The lock was pretty, and surrounded by woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tie up anywhere you want,'' said Pidgeon, who was
cutting the grass. He also plants flowers at the lock, and polishes
to a burnished gleam the lock's brass and copper switches and
contacts, circa 1915.
</P>
<P>
   Pidgeon, 38, who lives nearby, said he loved meeting boaters,
and once offered his office for the night to a 70-ish man who was
navigating the canal by canoe, in a driving rain. Pidgeon's
13-year-old son sometimes goes fishing near the lock for trout and
bass.
</P>
<P>
   Pidgeon, a former electrician who brings an eloquence to his
job, said he considered himself less an employee of the state and
more a ``guardian'' of a fine museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``How's that saying go?'' he said. ``Once you find a job you
love, you never work another day in your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Early the next morning, a beautiful mist rose up from the canal.
We were sad to head home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lock 25, Lock 25, Lock 25. This is the vessel Onondaga
requesting eastbound passage. Over.''

   ``Lock 25, Lock 25, Lock 25. This is the vessel Onondaga
requesting westbound passage. Over.''
</P>
<P>
   I felt silly, but what fun it was. Anyone traveling on the Erie
Canal in upstate New York must call ahead by two-way radio to the
laconic men and women operating the locks. Lock-tenders, as they're
unofficially called, report that canal amateurs tend to get
overexcited by the radio, as if reliving a childhood fantasy about
navigating a battleship. ``It's new to them,'' said Joe Pidgeon,
the lock-tender of the bucolic Lock 25 near Savannah, N.Y. ``You
can tell when they pull up to the lock, because they keep
chirping.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, my family and I piloted our own rented boat _ the
10-ton, 34-foot, very personable Onondaga _ for nearly 150 miles on
the Erie and Cayuga-Seneca Canals. Over five days we went from just
north of Syracuse to Seneca Falls to the edge of Rochester and
back. (Different kinds of boats are available for weekends.)
</P>
<P>
   We traveled at six miles an hour, ate and slept on the Onondaga,
and saw wilderness, sleepy courthouses and one wastewater treatment
plant. Not every sight was exquisite. But the clock slowed down,
and distances seemed much farther, just as they had in an earlier
century. Although we've lived in India and Japan, and have trekked
in Nepal, this turned out to be one of the most exotic things we
have ever done.
</P>
<P>
   The magic of the canal is not so much its remote stretches of
beauty, but the sensation it offers of traveling along an artery of
history. To float down the Erie Canal is to have an intimate
connection with the way it was built to be used.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the small towns we passed had remnants of the
19th-century mills that drove the industrial revolution and used
the canal to ship their goods. We were right down in the water,
where the power was.
</P>
<P>
   For years I have wanted to go to Seneca Falls, the site of the
first women's rights convention. To arrive there for the first time
by water _ to tie up our boat just below Wesleyan Chapel, where in
1848 Elizabeth Cady Stanton read the ``Declaration of Sentiments,''
demanding that women be given the vote _ made the journey more
personal and gave the town a lost-in-time feel (at least until a
group of 20th-century teen-agers turned up to drink in the park
right outside our boat).
</P>
<P>
   The 340-mile-long Erie, finished in 1825, was America's greatest
canal. Before the railroads and highways, it connected the Great
Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean as the crucial route for shipping the
crops and products of the Western states to the East. It did
nothing less than transform New York City into a commercial
superpower. Philadelphia had been the nation's chief seaport, but
two decades after the canal was finished New York was supreme.
</P>
<P>
   DeWitt Clinton, the New York City mayor and then New York
governor who spent a political career promoting the canal's
creation _ his dream was at first derided as ``Clinton's Ditch'' _
is today a visionary for what he imagined the canal would do for
New York. ``The city will, in the course of time, become the
granary of the world,'' he once wrote, ``the emporium of commerce,
the seat of manufactures, the focus of great moneyed operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Our adventure began at 7 a.m. on Saturday. The four of us _ my
husband, me and our two children, ages 8 and 4 _ drove the five
hours from our home in Westchester County to Cold Springs Harbour
Marina near the northern edge of Onondaga Lake, just above
Syracuse. After loading up with groceries, we boarded our boat for
an orientation by Carl Peterson, 17, of Mid-Lakes Navigation, the
largest and oldest boat rental company on the Erie.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson showed us around the barge, from the diesel engine to
the head and shower, then told us it was time to cast off. I put
the children in life jackets and undid the lines while my husband,
Steve Weisman, took the tiller under Peterson's eye.
</P>
<P>
   Steve has had some experience with boats, but not with a 10-ton
barge; the Onondaga, though easy to handle, took practice.
Amazingly, Mid-Lakes rents to complete novices, but it heartily
recommends that you take out $1 million in liability insurance. We
did that, through Mid-Lakes, for $75.
</P>
<P>
   While Steve practiced his turns in the canal, I unpacked and
looked over our new home. The boat was a marvel. A decade ago,
Mid-Lakes began building what it calls Lockmasters, modeled on
19th-century European canal boats, for recreational use on the
Erie. The Onondaga, one of the newest Lockmasters, had a steel
hull, with a metal exterior painted a pleasing red, gold and forest
green.
</P>
<P>
   Inside it looked like a floating Adirondack cabin with
light-pine paneled walls and braided rugs.
</P>
<P>
   There was a double bed, a sofa that turned into bunk beds for
the children at night and a small dining table with cushioned
benches up in the bow. In the kitchen was a two-burner stove, an
oven, a sink and a small refrigerator and freezer.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Wiles Wing manages the nine Mid-Lakes Lockmasters, and
she is a woman after my own heart. The Onondaga was not only
immaculate but obsessively well equipped, from a potato peeler to a
portable propane grill to a corkscrew to salt and pepper shakers.
There were even two bicycles strapped to the top deck.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson helped us through the first lock, No. 24, in
Baldwinsville. It wasn't that easy; while Steve steered the boat
through the gates and along the cement wall, I stood in the bow and
grabbed for one of the lines hanging from the top of the lock. (The
lines were covered with the most fantastic green slime I have ever
seen. Ms. Wing thoughtfully supplied rubber gloves.)
</P>
<P>
   Steve, in the stern, grabbed for a line, too. We held the
Onondaga parallel to the wall as the gates closed and millions of
gallons of water filled the lock. In minutes we were lifted up 11
feet. Then the gates in front of us opened, and out we glided. The
locks, 36 in all, are necessary because of the 568-foot rise in the
canal as it stretches west from the Hudson River to Lake Erie.
</P>
<P>
   We tied up alongside a cemetery in Baldwinsville, said goodbye
to Peterson, grilled some salmon for dinner, then went to bed and
slapped miserably at mosquitoes all night. We bought a can of Raid
the next day, and it saved us for the rest of the trip.
</P>
<P>
   We cast off Sunday at 10 a.m., marveling at the blue herons, the
red-tipped maple leaves and the labor of the 19th-century workers,
many Irish immigrants who fought malarial mosquitoes as they dug
the canal through the Montezuma Marsh, now the Montezuma National
Wildlife Refuge.
</P>
<P>
   We were not in the original Erie Canal, but the enlarged Erie
built after 1905, parallel to the first, which made use of existing
rivers and lakes. Even at that time, railroads had cut heavily into
the canal's traffic, and by the 1950s, the opening of the St.
Lawrence Seaway and the New York State Thruway made it obsolete.

 THE POLITICS OF STATE SYMBOLS   (For use by New York Times News
Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c. 1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While the nation's capital is obsessed with
President Clinton's impeachment problems, thank goodness real life
goes on as usual elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In Nebraska, for instance, Gov. Ben Nelson took the important
political step Thursday of naming milk the official state beverage.
The proclamation was accompanied by ceremonial fanfare, press
releases and photogenic poses in gubernatorial milk mustache.
</P>
<P>
   Don't think trivial pursuit here. This is a bigger deal than you
may realize.
</P>
<P>
   Every state has designated certain items _ including
commodities, flora, fauna and inanimate objects _ as official
symbols of local culture and character. The selection of these
emblems is no casual affair; heated controversies rage about the
relative merits of the contenders.
</P>
<P>
   The states have set the pace, but they are supplemented by the
federal government, which also looks toward the garden for a
visible token of who we are and what we like. In 1986, Congress
passed a joint resolution, signed by President Ronald Reagan and
certified in a solemn White House ceremony, making the rose the
``national floral emblem''.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Congress had debated whether the country would go
to seed without a national flower, pondering some 70 bills on
behalf of various candidates. This thorny issue featured, from time
to time, the corn tassel, the carnation, the apple blossom, the
Shasta daisy and the mountain laurel.
</P>
<P>
   Garden clubs lobbied, florists took polls and the names of such
rose growers as George Washington and several first ladies were
invoked. The strongest challenge came from the sturdy marigold,
championed by Senate Republican Leader Everett Dirksen.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Congress decided that 4,000 songs with the word
``rose'' in the title couldn't be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone has an opinion on this stuff, whether out of a simple
desire to honor a favorite thing or to promote some industry for
potential financial profit. Actually, it's all pretty harmless. And
easier to identify with than the grim, distant business of bringing
down a president.
</P>
<P>
   Even Nelson's selection of milk, a drink widely regarded as
healthy, was not universally applauded. People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals (PETA) objected, arguing that milk is a
disreputable product because the organization believes cows are
often mistreated.
</P>
<P>
   The politics of picking state symbols can be so tricky that the
Nebraska unicameral legislature, which used to bear this heavy
burden, tossed the responsibility to the governor several years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   From the legislative balcony in 1992 I watched an intense debate
over whether to change the identity of the state bird, which pitted
feathered vertebrates familiar to urban areas against favorites in
rural communities. Tempers flared, insults were exchanged. An
earlier choice, the meadowlark, prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson has found himself balancing competing state interests as
carefully as though a major spending bill were involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do research on this,'' he says in bemusement. It is
politically necessary to determine which candidate actually best
represents the flavor of the state. When the cattle industry
mounted a campaign to name beef the official state product, he
considered the potential fury of hog-growers and declined to make a
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson similarly ducked a competition between corn and wheat
producers, both of whom wanted their crop formally identified as
the state's dominant agricultural asset. The two crops are crucial
to the local economy and Nelson saw no reason to pick sides in that
one, either.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska is more enthusiastic about animal, vegetable and
mineral symbols than some other states, although they all play that
game to some extent. Nebraska has a state insect, the honeybee, a
lovable honey-producer also honored in Kansas, South Dakota,
Vermont, Mississippi, Missouri, Wisconsin and North Carolina.
Connecticut honors the praying mantis, Ohio the ladybug and
Illinois the beautiful Monarch butterfly. No state has yet picked
the mosquito.
</P>
<P>
   Most states have an official flower, stone, bird, song, and
tree. But some have a formal fossil _ Nebraska's is the mammoth,
remains of which have been discovered in the region. Many have an
official fish, chosen for its abundance in local waters. There are
many regional oddities.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina has an official reptile, the Eastern Box turtle;
Louisiana's reptile is the unfriendly alligator. South Carolina has
an official shell, the lettered olive found on local beaches. Texas
has an official dish _ chili, snatch.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada has an official grass, the Indian rice grass; Montana has
the bluebunch whitegrass and Nebraska, the little blue stem.
Minnesota has an official mushroom, the morel. Idaho has an
official horse, the Appaloosa. Alabama has an official nut, the
pecan.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the American way.

 UNDATED: it obsolete.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today the focus is on tourism. In a five-year plan, millions of
dollars in federal and state money is being spent to improve the
canal's locks, moorings and bike paths. In 1992, the legislature
created the Canal Recreationway Commission and renamed all four
interconnected canals in the state _ the Erie, the Cayuga-Seneca,
the Champlain and the Oswego _ as the New York State Canal System.
</P>
<P>
   We arrived in Seneca Falls by 6 p.m., and on Monday morning
toured Wesleyan Chapel and Stanton's home, where a park ranger,
Richard Pardee, told us that Stanton considered Seneca Falls an
``awful, mud-rutted town.'' I thought it was better than that, but
no doubt things have improved. By 2 p.m. we were back on the water,
headed west.
</P>
<P>
   The days fell into a nice pattern. We would cast off around 8
a.m., eat breakfast and lunch while under way, then anchor on a
quiet stretch in the hot afternoons for a swim. The water was
murky, a little creepy, but cold. I never saw anybody else swim in
the canal, except for a teen-age boy who jumped in 60 feet from the
top of a railroad bridge, screaming at the top of his lungs. (It
was a stunt, and he survived.)
</P>
<P>
   My husband was happy because he discovered he could read while
he drove the boat, although only half a page at a time; I navigated
from the detailed charts supplied by Mid-Lakes. I also became an
avid reader of the Onondaga's logbooks, which Mid-Lakes encourages
boaters to keep. Most log entries were about restaurants and birds
spotted along the way, but a few were soulful reflections from
boaters who suddenly had found time to think.
</P>
<P>
   ``Met lovely old man in Clyde,'' wrote a woman from Skaneateles,
N.Y., last year. ``Must have been 85-plus _ working his 5x10 store
after 63 years!! He's lonesome &AMP; wants to talk but can tell he
doesn't want to be inappropriate. We buy some stuff and linger _
hard to pull away. Hope we see him again _ he's a really lovely
human being. Working to stay alive, psychologically _ more power to
him. ... Testimony to the human spirit, like the canal.''
</P>
<P>
   We stayed Monday night in Lyons, and by Tuesday reached
Fairport, an affluent suburb of Rochester. We looked over the
Fairport Historical Museum, went on a walking tour of some
19th-century Greek revival and Italianate homes, had dinner at the
Green Tavern and went to bed in a thunderstorm.
</P>
<P>
   Fairport has revitalized its canal front, and it's spiffy, but
it also felt like an upscale mall. It would be awful if every canal
waterfront looked the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning we turned back toward home, reaching Lock No.
25, and Pidgeon, its lock-tender, by dinner time. It was six more
hours to Cold Springs Harbour Marina, so we decided to stay
overnight. The lock was pretty, and surrounded by woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tie up anywhere you want,'' said Pidgeon, who was
cutting the grass. He also plants flowers at the lock, and polishes
to a burnished gleam the lock's brass and copper switches and
contacts, circa 1915.
</P>
<P>
   Pidgeon, 38, who lives nearby, said he loved meeting boaters,
and once offered his office for the night to a 70-ish man who was
navigating the canal by canoe, in a driving rain. Pidgeon's
13-year-old son sometimes goes fishing near the lock for trout and
bass.
</P>
<P>
   Pidgeon, a former electrician who brings an eloquence to his
job, said he considered himself less an employee of the state and
more a ``guardian'' of a fine museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``How's that saying go?'' he said. ``Once you find a job you
love, you never work another day in your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Early the next morning, a beautiful mist rose up from the canal.
We were sad to head home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lock 25, Lock 25, Lock 25. This is the vessel Onondaga
requesting eastbound passage. Over.''

   Broadway Hops As Hope Springs
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Less than 24 hours after Labor Day, the delirious
spin of practice, previews and publicity stunts had begun on
Broadway _ and the stages that lead there.
</P>
<P>
   In a dance studio in Chelsea, director George C. Wolfe started
rehearsing ``On the Town,'' the Joseph Papp Public Theater's
on-again, off-again Broadway musical, scheduled to begin
performances at the Gershwin Theater on Nov. 19.
</P>
<P>
   At Atlanta's Alliance Theater, the cast of Disney's latest stage
effort, ``Elaborate Lives: The Legend of Aida,'' written by Elton
John and Tim Rice, prepared for previews there Thursday before a
possible move to Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   And on West 46th Street, German pop diva Ute Lemper, who made
her debut Tuesday night in ``Chicago,'' found herself hoisted 25
feet in the air in a cherry picker, wearing a revealing skirt and
waving a bottle of champagne at a claque of smiling press agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at her!'' said a tourist, pointing his camera. ``Who is
that?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, that may be a too common question on Broadway this
season, with a calendar crowded with the unknown and untested.
Among writers making their debut are a lawyer, a radio sidekick and
a woman best known as the voice of the Flintstones' Betty Rubble.
No major American playwright has a work scheduled for Broadway this
fall and even the musicals have largely unknown casts. (The
exception is the Roundabout's revival of ``Little Me,'' starring
Martin Short and Faith Prince, set to open on Oct. 29.)
</P>
<P>
   Off-Broadway is another story. John Turturro and Tony Shalhoub
are signed to play the existential tramps Vladimir and Estragon in
the Classic Stage Company's production of Beckett's ``Waiting for
Godot,'' directed by Andrei Belgrader for an opening Nov. 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've actually never seen the play,'' Turturro said. ``But I've
been reading it to my 8-year-old and he's been laughing so I think
that's a good sign.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Public in the East Village, Patrick Stewart and Blythe
Danner are cast as a bigamist and one of his wives in Arthur
Miller's ``Ride Down Mount Morgan,'' beginning previews Oct. 27.
And at the CSC Theater, the Oscar winner Frances McDormand and the
up-and-comer Billy Crudup will appear in a ``new'' version of
``Oedipus,'' by the intimidatingly named playwright Dare Clubb.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, since it is early in the season, optimism is in.
``Hope springs eternal this time of year,'' said Jed Bernstein, the
executive director of the League of American Theaters and
Producers.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest story may be at the Manhattan Theater Club,
where Terrence McNally's ``Corpus Christi'' begins previews Sept.
22 at City Center, despite protests by some Roman Catholic groups
against the play's portrayal of a Christ-like character as a
homosexual.
</P>
<P>
   Male Swans, Too
</P>
<P>
   Only two new musicals are scheduled for Broadway thus far.
</P>
<P>
   The first is a $6.5 million adaptation of the 1984 hit movie
``Footloose,'' which opened its tryout at Washington's Kennedy
Center in August to middling reviews that focused on the music. The
producers plan an Oct. 22 opening at the Richard Rodgers Theater.
</P>
<P>
   The other musical is ``Parade,'' a $5 million collaboration
between Livent and Lincoln Center. The producers are betting on the
precocious talent of a 28-year-old composer and lyricist, Jason
Robert Brown. The show, which tells the somber tale of a Jewish
factory worker wrongfully accused of murder, begins rehearsals
Monday, and late this week, Brown was still putting touches on the
score.
</P>
<P>
   The creative team for ``Parade'' includes the playwright Alfred
Uhry, who wrote the book, and Harold Prince, who directed. The show
opens in December at the Beaumont.
</P>
<P>
   The best buzz of the season may belong to ``Swan Lake,'' an
adaptation of the Tchaikovsky ballet by the director-choreographer
Matthew Bourne. The piece's hook is all-male swans, or as the
show's press materials put it, ``the shattering of the traditional
concept of swans in tutus.'' Previews for a 16-week run begin at
the Neil Simon Theater on Sept. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Mandy Patinkin's one-man revue of musical numbers sung in
Yiddish, ``Mamaloshen,'' will occupy the Belasco Theater for three
weeks beginning on Oct. 13, And in a truly ageless piece of
casting, the 45-year-old Cathy Rigby will reprise her role in
``Peter Pan,'' at the Marquis.
</P>
<P>
   Unknowns Rule
</P>
<P>
   After a season with the works of Arthur Miller, Eugene Ionesco
and David Mamet, in October, Broadway theatergoers will encounter
the likes of the dramatists Michael Chepiga, B.J. Ward and Rob
Bartlett.
</P>
<P>
   Introductions may be necessary. Bartlett, 41, is the morning pal
of the radio host Don Imus, and a regular in Atlantic City with his
all-female band, the Bartlettes. ``More to Love,'' his
three-character play, opens on Oct. 15 at the Eugene O'Neill. Three
days later, Ms. Ward's ``Stand-Up Opera,'' opens at the Lyceum. Ms.
Ward is an actress and voice-over specialist (Ms. Rubble, Wonder
Woman) who developed her one-woman show out of a series of
improvised monologues.
</P>
<P>
   Chepiga is a 50-year-old lawyer whose play, ``Getting and
Spending,'' about a woman accused of insider trading, won the 1995
New Dramatists award for playwriting. After a run in San Diego, it
moves to the Helen Hayes in late October.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Bernhard is bringing her solo show ``I'm Still Here . . .
Damn It!'' to the Booth, for a Nov. 5 opening. In addition, two
imports from the West End, Patrick Marber's ``Closer'' and Terry
Johnson's ``Hysteria,'' appear likely to debut here soon, but have
not yet landed theaters.
</P>
<P>
   But as in the past, the bulk of new plays will open off- or
off-off-Broadway. Among ones to watch: ``Wit,'' with Kathleen
Chalfant, at the MCC Theater this month; ``Impossible Marriage'' by
Beth Henley, at the Roundabout's Laura Pels, in October, and
``Spread Eagle,'' with Brian Murray, at the WPA Theater in
November. Early 1999 promises new works by Harold Pinter, Paula
Vogel and Athol Fugard.
</P>
<P>
   But that's a long way off. Between now and then, in the words of
Beckett's clowns, ``is the beauty of the way. And the goodness of
the wayfarers.''

   GADELEGATION _ WASHINGTON _ Members of the Georgia delegation
will play a big role in the weeks to come: Barr's on Judiciary,

<P>
   RUSSIA-CRISIS _ MOSCOW _ Ending Russia's debilitating political
standoff, President Boris Yeltsin bowed to opponents Thursday by
nominating Foreign Minister Yvegeny Primakov as prime minister. The
move was hailed by the Communist-led Duma, which had been ready to
reject Viktor Chernomyrdin for a third time and confront Yeltsin
with impeachment proceedings. Now, Primakov must assemble a
government and put an economic crisis plan into action. Meanwhile,
the ruble strenghtened, but economists warned it was a temporary
pheonomenon. Other developments of the day. (Holmes, Cox News

Institute on Aging at an event focusing on the importance of
exercise and fitness for people 50 and over. (Montgomery, Cox News

<P>
   BLACK-FARMERS _ WASHINGTON _ The Black Leadership Forum, Inc.
holds an event to discuss ``A Call for Justice, Assembly, Prayer
Vigil'' and announce a lawsuit against the Department of
Agriculture. Topics of discussion include the call for
implementation of 1997 recommendations of Civil Rights Action Team,
of Small Farm Commission, and for equity from private lending
institutions; a request for full funding of the Farm Bill Section
2501 for technical assistance to minority family farmers. (Moscoso,
Cox News Service).

<P>
   ROAD-HEROS _ ATLANTA _ Atlanta's HEROs have more than their
share of what I call tales of the road. In their three years of
patrolling metro freeways and aiding stranded motorists, the
Highway Emergency Response Operators have just about seen it all.
We relate the classic tale of a HERO vs. an escaped parrot inside a
sedan; the HERO who saved a truckload of livestock from heatstroke;
and others. (Ledford, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   ABORTIONPROTEST _ ATLANTA _ Anti-abortion crusaders plan to
leaflet Osborne H.S. beginning at 7:30 a.m. Thursday. These same
people already have an injunction against this practice in the
Marietta schools, although the injunction only names John &AMP; Jane
Doe and unnamed others. The crusaders deny affiliation with
Operation Rescue, but their activities apparently match a national
campaign being conducted by O.R. volunteers, namely bringing God
back to school. (Payne, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   REVENGE _ Special interest lobbying groups from across the
ideological divide are training their crosshairs on Wisconsin, a
key battleground state in the 1998 mid-term elections. Groups as
diverse as Gary Bauer's Campaign for Working Families, the Sierra
Club, Americans for Job Security and others are developing issue
ads to target at the dairy state, a confluence of issue advocacy
spending that could make Wisconsin the most heavily targeted state
in the country. Sen. Russ Feingold (D-Wis.) may be the reason for
much of the spending. Feingold, up for re-election this year, was
the Democratic champion of campaign finance reform legislation that
would have sharply restricted issue advocacy if enacted. (Foskett,
Cox News Service)
</P>
<P>
   NRA _ The Union of Concerned Scientists has taken up the cause
of Curtis Overall, a whistleblower at a TVA nuclear power plant who
has received death threats. The union contends the NRC is not
properly investigating the threats. (Harmon, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)

   JAMAICA-BIRDWATCHING-$ADV12 _ MONTEGO BAY, Jamaica _ Sure,
Jamaica's known for its stunning beaches and plush resorts, but
being near the water and sipping margaritas aren't all there is to
do in this popular Caribbean country. Birdwatching, for example, is
attracting a growing number of travelers. And, Jamaica boasts one
of the Caribbean's most unique attractions: the Rocklands Feeding
Station in the village of Anchovy, just a short drive from Montego
Bay. At the station, home to 93-year-old ornithologist Lisa Salmon,
visitors can feed all sorts of wild birds from the palms of their
hands. Visitors can also hunt for butterflies _ Jamaica is home to
the largest butterfly in the Americas. So, you don't have to go to
Jamaica just for the water. (Emling, Cox News Service). WITH

   CARIBBEAN-CRIME-$ADV12 _ PARADISE ISLAND, Bahamas _ It's called
paradise, but this island is having a hard time living up to its
name. In the past two weeks, three foreigners have been murdered
here, including a young American school teacher. The latest murder
occured on Sept. 2 when a man who worked on Carnival Cruise Line's
Fantasy ship was shot to death during a robbery. No one's been
accused of the crimes and so, according to the headlines, there's a
``Killer On The Loose.'' But the Bahamas is not only plagued by
rising crime, it's also awash with drugs, mostly cocaine. During
the first three months of 1998, officials seized more cocaine than
in the previous three years combined. All this hardly bodes well
for the reputation of the Bahamas, or for the winter months, the
biggest season for tourists in the Caribbean. The Bahamian islands
host 3 million tourists each year, and rely on tourists for 70
percent of their income. (Emling, Cox News Service).

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday the ill-defined center of stagnant Tropical Storm
Frances wobbled over the Gulf of Mexico about 150 miles east of
Brownsville, Texas. Friday, the sluggish system will likely
approach southern Texas. A storm surge of several feet will
continue as the tropical storm comes ashore, causing additional
flooding. Heavy rains will affect much of the Texas seaboard as
robust onshore winds transport moisture inland. Because of the
broad and complex nature of the system, a second focus of heavy
rain could occur over parts of Louisiana and Mississippi, rather
far removed from the storm's center. Cirrus clouds blowing east of
the top of the system will dim the sun as far east as Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms will flare over the
Southwestern states as a nearly stationary low pressure system at
altitudes of several thousand feet over the central Sierra Nevada
continues to draw moisture northward. Farther northeast, scattered
showers and isolated storms will develop over parts of the northern
Rockies in response to a jet stream disturbance.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the leading edge of warmer air will push toward the
Northeast on Friday. After a chilly start, temperatures will rise
toward seasonal levels, but variable cirrus clouds will limit
warming in some places, particularly over the northern Middle
Atlantic and eastern Great Lakes states.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated showers will escort a cool front across the upper
Middle West. With steering winds blowing from the west, the coolest
air in the wake of the front will be confined to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: HURRICANE APEX
</P>
<P>
   Tropical Storm Frances formed over the Gulf of Mexico on
Wednesday, and the system will continue to batter the Texas coast
Friday at the apex of the tropical storm season. In nine out of ten
years since 1886, at least one tropical storm or hurricane has
raged in the Atlantic on September 11. No other date has had more
storms. Atlantic waters are warmest in early September, nurturing
tropical storms, which draw energy from the warmth of the ocean.
Meanwhile, strong high-level winds associated with the jet stream
that are capable of tearing a storm apart are normally still over
northern latitudes.

`ROUNDERS': KNOWING WHEN TO HOLD 'EM AND FOLD 'EM BUT NOT WHEN TO
RUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Production notes are at the end of review.)  
(js) 
 By JANET MASLIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though John Dahl's ``Rounders'' finally adds up to less than
meets the eye, what does meet the eye (and ear) is mischievously
entertaining. Inspired by Martin Scorsese's brand of lowlife and
aided by a splendid rogues' gallery of a cast, the director of
``The Last Seduction'' takes his audience behind closed doors and
into the world of high-stakes poker, a demimonde captured with
abundant local color. With settings that range from an Elks' hall
in Binghamton, New York to a yuppie cigar bar to Russian Turkish
Baths, Dahl's film has character in oversupply even if its actual
characters are sometimes thin. Poker fever makes up for whatever
the story lacks in everyday emotions.
</P>
<P>
   In yet another role cast before ``Good Will Hunting'' dealt him
a winning hand, Matt Damon plays a clean-cut law student with a
naughty secret: he's capable of betting his tuition on an all-night
game of Texas Hold `Em with a Russian gambling kingpin. (John
Malkovich has a field day with this role, with a vowel-bending
accent that turns ``OK'' into a drawling ``Ak-yay.'') As written by
David Levien and Brian Koppelman with a keener ear for gambling
jargon than for story trajectory, ``Rounders'' finds Damon's Mike
McDermott determined to resist poker, and then, not too
surprisingly, starts breaking down his resolve.
</P>
<P>
   To keep him on the straight and narrow, Mike has a night job
delivering beverages and a clean-cut girlfriend from law school
(Gretchen Mol, who enjoyed a lot more exposure on a recent Vanity
Fair cover than she does in this minor, one-note role). Naturally,
they're no match for the poker addiction that Dahl seems to find as
enticing as the characters do. Though the film has routine daytime
scenes, it truly lives by night in a world of glamorous shadows,
smoldering colors and secret thrills. None of those thrills is
sexual, incidentally, since these gamblers live in a realm where a
pair of aces beats a seductive babe every time. Famke Janssen
slinks through the film as what would be an attractive alternative
to card-playing in any other story.
</P>
<P>
   Mike's fate is pretty much sealed by the reappearance of Worm
(the wildly changeable, always startling Edward Norton), a
fast-talking card shark who lives up to his name. As in ``Mean
Streets,'' here comes the grinning, reckless childhood friend who
becomes an instant problem for his more upstanding pal. But
whatever Mike and Worm lack in conceptual novelty, they become
seductively good company as they share a series of shrewd
late-night poker scams.
</P>
<P>
   Also especially good are John Turturro as the story's savviest
gambler and Michael Rispoli as a loan shark named Grama despite
decidedly ungrandmotherly demeanor. Martin Landau plays a judge,
and so does Vernon E. Jordan Jr. In a film whose casually
malevolent look recalls ``The Last Seduction,'' Jean Yves Escoffier
contributes deep-hued, evocative cinematography to the overall dark
allure.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCTION NOTES:
</P>
<P>
   `ROUNDERS'
</P>
<P>
   Directed by John Dahl; written by David Levien and Brian
Koppelman; director of photography, Jean Yves Escoffier; edited by
Scott Chestnut; music by Christopher Young; production designer,
Rob Pearson; produced by Joel Stillerman and Ted Demme; released by
Miramax Films. Running time: 120 minutes. This film is rated R. It
includes profanity, brief partial nudity and suggestive situations.
It includes threats of violence without more than momentary gore,
and a menacing quality achieved the old-fashioned way: without need
of guns.
</P>
<P>
   With: Matt Damon (Mike McDermott), Edward Norton (Worm), John
Turturro (Joey Knish), Famke Janssen (Petra), Gretchen Mol (Jo),
John Malkovich (Teddy KGB) and Martin Landau (Professor Petrovsky).

   ISRAEL-DEADLOCKED-$ADV13 _ ITZHAR, West Bank _ Amid the olive
orchards and goat herds fields on this hillside, Arabs and Jews are
filling the void caused by stalled peace talks with aggressive
moves aimed at getting an edge for an uncertain future. Two Jewish
settlers were killed here recently in an ambush laid, presumably,
by Palestinians. Already worried that they will literally lose
ground in future concessions, the settlers responded with 15 new
homes in the occupied territory, just the kind of move that
American diplomats and Palestinians warn will destroy what is left
of the peace process. (Kaplow, Cox News Service).

   MEXICO-CORRUPTION-$ADV13 _ MORELOS, Mexico _ In some cases,
entire families have been kidnapped and held for ransom during
Mexico's recent crime plague. Almost everyone has a tale to tell
about being robbed or assaulted. But it's high-level corruption
among law officials and political figures _ as much as common
criminals _ who many blame for Mexico's struggle with injustice
these days. Corruption is spotlighted in news reports that are more
aggressive than they once were, and popular citizens' movements
have had some success in driving allegedly corrupt political
figures out of office _ achievements once unheard of in Mexico. But
every day, it seems, there are new reports of suspected acts of
corruption that are testing public patience. Police are arrested
for rape and kidnapping; a former Mexico City transportation
director is arrested for misuse of funds; bankers are reviled for
helping themselves to bad loans and then expecting the public
treasury to bail them out. Is corruption getting worse, or it
simply being exposed more? (Ferriss, Cox News Service).

   MOUNT-VERNON _ MOUNT VERNON, Va. _ Nearly 200 years after George
Washington died in an upstairs bedroom of his beloved plantation
overlooking the Potomac River, his house is getting
air-conditioning. That's cool with most folks. Millions of summer
visitors have sweated through tours of the carefully preserved home
of the nation's first president, and electric fans are needed to
keep guides from fainting in the stifling heat. But a few
preservationists are downright hot over the decision of Mount
Vernon's governing board to install a $1 million computerized
climate control system in one of America's most historic homes.

   ELEPHANTS _ The young elephant calf follows its mother as they
flee across the African bush, away from the helicopter swooping in
behind them. Douw Grobler, a man with 100 elephant kills under his
belt, leans out of the helicopter and fires a steel dart into the
thick hide of the fleeing mother elephant. This time, however, the
elephant isn't being hunted. Grobler is part of a team of
researchers from Georgia, South Africa and Germany that is pursuing
female elephants for their ovaries, not their ivory. And elephant
lives are being saved. Dr. Richard Fayrer-Hosken, of the University
of Georgia's Department of Large Animal Medicine, is developing a
contraceptive vaccine to help control elephant populations, which
have traditionally been thinned by hunting down the animals. The
program is a model for preserving healthy populations of rare
animals, with wide-ranging applications. (Aldag, Atlanta

<P>
   On Wednesday, at last, Kenneth Starr sent to Congress his report
on Bill Clinton's actions and obfuscations in the Monica Lewinsky
affair. It was, as expected, comprehensive: 36 white boxes in the
back of two black vans.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Starr may prove or fail to prove, the damage is done.
</P>
<P>
   What began as a trickle has become a flood. First, former aides
wrote sad columns in the news magazines. Then candidates running
for re-election in Maryland, Iowa and New York said they did not
want the president to show his face in their districts.
</P>
<P>
   By last week, the list of the outraged and estranged included
both California's senators, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York,
Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, Pat Leahy of Vermont and -- most strikingly
-- Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, who delivered to the Senate a
devastating account of how Bill Clinton had let America down.
</P>
<P>
   All these people are Democrats; all once counted themselves as
the president's friends. And all now see him as a liability both to
his party and his country.
</P>
<P>
   It is not Starr whom Clinton should fear, but the supporters and
sympathizers he has left feeling betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   The American presidency is surprisingly vulnerable, checked on
every side by the legislature, the judiciary, the press and the
people. An American president has no power except his own moral
authority, his ability to persuade and set the example.
</P>
<P>
   But these depend largely on his character. Inevitably, his
private flaws have public consequences. By recklessly pursuing
Monica Lewinsky and then emphatically denying it, Clinton knew he
was endangering the whole program on which he was elected. He went
ahead anyway.
</P>
<P>
   That is why his friends in the Democratic Party are now so hurt.
They supported him for his administrative energy and his huge
political talents, hoping against hope that he would heed his own
mantra of ``personal responsibility.'' But he let them down, and
did not even have the grace to make a decent apology.
</P>
<P>
   Any president at the mid-point of his second term is in a weak
position. His reforming ardor is exhausted, and attention is
shifting to his successor.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not normal second-term weakness. This is a president
who has forfeited respect to the point of political impotence.
Nowadays even Al Gore -- First Friend and heir-apparent -- is
conspicuous by his absence.
</P>
<P>
   It would be hard enough even for a scandal-free Bill Clinton to
persuade Congress that it should fund the IMF, approve fast-track
authority for trade talks or reform Social Security. But he
approaches Congress now empty of all credibility and with no moral
leverage to demand either sacrifice or restraint; for how much of
either has he shown himself?
</P>
<P>
   It is said that Americans at large do not care. This may well
change. If Starr's report does not nauseate them (as perhaps it may
not), they may well be rattled by signs of downturn in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The president's high job-approval ratings have a fragile look
about them. Other polls, measuring public respect for the
president's character and his sharing of their values, are already
dismally low. The public would desperately prefer the matter to be
dropped; but that may be because they find it too painful to be
reminded, day after day, of the character of the man who is their
representative to the world.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been in deep peril before, and every time he has
rebounded. Anger and defiance have re-energized him. After the
blistering rebuke of the mid-term elections in 1994, he rallied
against the Republicans and, within a year, had them on the
defensive. Often over the past two years, when scandal threatened
to upend him, he escaped by lashing out at Starr and the ``vast
right-wing conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   But defiance will not work any more. Yes, the press and the
prosecutor have hounded him, the prosecutor with a set of statutory
powers never employed so fiercely against any other president.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, obsessive and infuriating as Starr may have been, he is not
the man who has brought Clinton to this pass. The president's own
demons have put him there.
</P>
<P>
   Some in his party -- Lieberman among them -- think Clinton may
yet recover with a fuller and broader apology. It is hard to see
how. First apologies are what count, and Clinton made his through
gritted teeth. He has subsequently said sorry a bit more, but
always under compulsion. Besides, since his lying was so sincerely
done, why should anyone believe his most sincere apology?
</P>
<P>
   The presentation of Starr's report to Congress now raises the
stakes. Congressmen, already convinced that the president cannot or
will not make reparation by himself, must brace themselves either
for impeachment proceedings or for some form of official rebuke.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself clearly hopes he can cling on. After all, he
still sits in the White House, rides in the presidential limousine,
shakes hands with Boris Yeltsin. Some world-shattering event, he
supposes, may yet enable him to shine internationally and recover
grace at home.
</P>
<P>
   That is quite possible. But clinging on for dear life is not
governing. As markets zigzag, Russia crumbles and terrorism rears
its head, self-pitying paralysis is not good enough.
</P>
<P>
   This newspaper has no wish for him to stay. And it is hard to
see why America should, either.

   Q: Why is the early edition of a newspaper called the
``bulldog'' edition?
</P>
<P>
   _ J.S., Stuart, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   A: The term ``bulldog edition,'' which describes the earliest
edition of a morning or Sunday newspaper, first shows up in print
in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, none of the newspaper staffers who popularized the
term wrote down its origin at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The best guess, which appears in the Encyclopedia of
Advertising, and elsewhere, is that several New York newspapers
``fought like bulldogs for circulation'' in the 1890s. Early
editions were part of that battle, so they took the name of the
tenacious dog.
</P>
<P>
   A less-flattering term for the media, ``yellow journalism,''
also dates back to the same decade. It was named after the comic
strip The Yellow Kid and refers to sensationalist reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is kapok a natural or a synthetic product?
</P>
<P>
   _ K.W., Arlington, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Kapok, a water- and decay-resistant fiber used as stuffing in
life preservers, upholstery and bedding, is cultivated from kapok
trees in East Asia, Africa and South America.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a fiber that is extracted from the seeds in the pods of
the kapok tree,'' Bruce Witherspoon writes in ``The Great Big Book
of Astounding Facts.''
</P>
<P>
   The tree, also called a silk-cotton tree, has been harvested
commercially since the 1890s. In addition to stuffing, it can be
used to produce fertilizer, soap and an edible oil refined from
seed kernels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Great Kapok Tree,'' the 1990 children's book by Lynne
Cherry, is used in elementary schools to teach about rain-forest
conservation.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who plays the grandfather in the Werther's Original candy
commercials?
</P>
<P>
   _ J.M.W., Fort Myers Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   A: That's Robert Rockwell, an actor who has appeared in recent
years on ``Growing Pains,'' ``Days of Our Lives'' and ``Beverly
Hills 90210.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell, who turns 77 on Oct. 15, may be best remembered from
the ``Our Miss Brooks'' radio and TV series. He portrayed biology
teacher Philip Boynton, a love interest of Eve Arden's Miss Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   This marks the actor's 50th year of work, according to his first
credit in the Internet Movie Database. He appeared in the Jimmy
Stewart-Joan Fontaine screwball comedy ``You Gotta Stay Happy.''
</P>
<P>
   You can write to Rockwell in care of Abrams-Rubaloff &AMP; Lawrence,

<P>
   On Wednesday, at last, Kenneth Starr sent to Congress his report
on Bill Clinton's actions and obfuscations in the Monica Lewinsky
affair. It was, as expected, comprehensive: 36 white boxes in the
back of two black vans.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Starr may prove or fail to prove, the damage is done.
</P>
<P>
   What began as a trickle has become a flood. First, former aides
wrote sad columns in the news magazines. Then candidates running
for re-election in Maryland, Iowa and New York said they did not
want the president to show his face in their districts.
</P>
<P>
   By last week, the list of the outraged and estranged included
both California's senators, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York,
Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, Pat Leahy of Vermont and -- most strikingly
-- Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, who delivered to the Senate a
devastating account of how Bill Clinton had let America down.
</P>
<P>
   All these people are Democrats; all once counted themselves as
the president's friends. And all now see him as a liability both to
his party and his country.
</P>
<P>
   It is not Starr whom Clinton should fear, but the supporters and
sympathizers he has left feeling betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   The American presidency is surprisingly vulnerable, checked on
every side by the legislature, the judiciary, the press and the
people. An American president has no power except his own moral
authority, his ability to persuade and set the example.
</P>
<P>
   But these depend largely on his character. Inevitably, his
private flaws have public consequences. By recklessly pursuing
Monica Lewinsky and then emphatically denying it, Clinton knew he
was endangering the whole program on which he was elected. He went
ahead anyway.
</P>
<P>
   That is why his friends in the Democratic Party are now so hurt.
They supported him for his administrative energy and his huge
political talents, hoping against hope that he would heed his own
mantra of ``personal responsibility.'' But he let them down, and
did not even have the grace to make a decent apology.
</P>
<P>
   Any president at the mid-point of his second term is in a weak
position. His reforming ardor is exhausted, and attention is
shifting to his successor.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not normal second-term weakness. This is a president
who has forfeited respect to the point of political impotence.
Nowadays even Al Gore -- First Friend and heir-apparent -- is
conspicuous by his absence.
</P>
<P>
   It would be hard enough even for a scandal-free Bill Clinton to
persuade Congress that it should fund the IMF, approve fast-track
authority for trade talks or reform Social Security. But he
approaches Congress now empty of all credibility and with no moral
leverage to demand either sacrifice or restraint; for how much of
either has he shown himself?
</P>
<P>
   It is said that Americans at large do not care. This may well
change. If Starr's report does not nauseate them (as perhaps it may
not), they may well be rattled by signs of downturn in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The president's high job-approval ratings have a fragile look
about them. Other polls, measuring public respect for the
president's character and his sharing of their values, are already
dismally low. The public would desperately prefer the matter to be
dropped; but that may be because they find it too painful to be
reminded, day after day, of the character of the man who is their
representative to the world.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been in deep peril before, and every time he has
rebounded. Anger and defiance have re-energized him. After the
blistering rebuke of the mid-term elections in 1994, he rallied
against the Republicans and, within a year, had them on the
defensive. Often over the past two years, when scandal threatened
to upend him, he escaped by lashing out at Starr and the ``vast
right-wing conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   But defiance will not work any more. Yes, the press and the
prosecutor have hounded him, the prosecutor with a set of statutory
powers never employed so fiercely against any other president.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, obsessive and infuriating as Starr may have been, he is not
the man who has brought Clinton to this pass. The president's own
demons have put him there.
</P>
<P>
   Some in his party -- Lieberman among them -- think Clinton may
yet recover with a fuller and broader apology. It is hard to see
how. First apologies are what count, and Clinton made his through
gritted teeth. He has subsequently said sorry a bit more, but
always under compulsion. Besides, since his lying was so sincerely
done, why should anyone believe his most sincere apology?
</P>
<P>
   The presentation of Starr's report to Congress now raises the
stakes. Congressmen, already convinced that the president cannot or
will not make reparation by himself, must brace themselves either
for impeachment proceedings or for some form of official rebuke.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself clearly hopes he can cling on. After all, he
still sits in the White House, rides in the presidential limousine,
shakes hands with Boris Yeltsin. Some world-shattering event, he
supposes, may yet enable him to shine internationally and recover
grace at home.
</P>
<P>
   That is quite possible. But clinging on for dear life is not
governing. As markets zigzag, Russia crumbles and terrorism rears
its head, self-pitying paralysis is not good enough.
</P>
<P>
   This newspaper has no wish for him to stay. And it is hard to
see why America should, either.

`THE U.S.-MEXICAN WAR': RATTLING MONTEZUMA'S HALLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for

 (bl)

<P>
   For Americans, the main significance of the Mexican-American War
was the vast enlargement of the United States, an addition of
500,000 square miles of Western lands all the way from Kansas to
the Pacific. Mexicans saw it differently, as a sheer land grab.
</P>
<P>
   Though ``The U.S.-Mexican War (1846-1848)'' celebrates American
prowess, it also acknowledges the Mexican claims and what the
expanding nation's takeover of the Western lands meant for the
American Indians in the way.
</P>
<P>
   The vigorous four-hour series begins Sunday with the fall of the
Alamo and the slaughter of its defenders in 1836. The
independence-minded Texans retaliated a few weeks later with a
victory at San Jacinto. Then came the Republic of Texas, which
eventually was annexed by the United States. A politically
unstable, militarily vulnerable Mexico, still recovering from its
revolution against Spain, found itself faced with an assertive
young United States, inspired by claims to ``manifest destiny'' and
dreams of westward expansion. A few years later, the two countries
were at war.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars from Mexico and the United States describe the
political influences at work; paintings and early photographs
capture something of the times. The main battles are effectively
re-enacted in a rugged looking terrain, and, in the spirit of ``The
Civil War,'' soldiers' letters home provide personal touches.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Mexican defenders are given their due, the main
attention in these four hours is on the American attackers. With
war fever high, volunteers, whipped up by newspapers like Walt
Whitman's Brooklyn Eagle, enlisted for the rough march West, a
conquest of half a continent. It was a one-sided affair from the
crossing of the Rio Grande to the seizure of the port of Vera Cruz,
ending with the storming of Mexico City. A Mexican scholar notes
that no Mexican soldier ever set foot on undisputed U.S. territory.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict was a seasoning ground for the men who would become
its Civil War generals: Ulysses S. Grant and Robert E. Lee; George
McClellan and Thomas ``Stonewall'' Jackson; Winfield Scott and
George Meade.
</P>
<P>
   The only Mexican general whom many Americans may have heard of
was Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, whose military record was not
auspicious, but who holds a place in American history as the heavy
at the Alamo. Somewhat more successful were the ``Californios,''
Mexican residents who succeeded in driving American troops out of
Los Angeles for a time and whose descendants became an important
element of the new state.
</P>
<P>
   It was a short war and not a conspicuously just one, and this
fair-minded series may leave American viewers with mixed feelings.
What is commemorated on this side of the Rio Grande as the
formation of a vast new country is still known in Mexico as ``The
United States Invasion.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The lights dimmed to darkness after the final bows.
There was the sound of muted jangling church bells. Then the lights
rose again to reveal, after two hours of horses and humans, three
attitudinous white ducks strutting and flapping in the center ring
as the audience left the theater.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the exotic cultural baggage and elaborate cultish
pretensions. Forget the generally limp attempts at melding
choreographed human movement with the exquisite motion of a horse.
Forget, in other words, the arty hokum that too often identifies
Zingaro, which opened on Wednesday night for a two-month engagement
at the Big Top tent at Battery Park City. What nearly saves this
``weird horse show,'' as one mostly admiring audience member put
it, are its moments of brilliantly imaginative, improbable magic.
</P>
<P>
   Those moments are too few in ``Eclipse,'' the French equestrian
company's new show, presented here under auspices of the Next Wave
Festival of the Brooklyn Academy of Music. But they are worth the
wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chimere,'' the piece with which Zingaro made its American
debut in 1996 at the academy, was set against a background of music
and costuming from the Indian state of Rajasthan and took place in
a double ring with a pool of water at the center. The culture of
choice for ``Eclipse,'' the second piece presented by Zingaro in
New York, is Korean. Pansori, the ancient Korean folk opera song
and instrumental music to which ``Eclipse'' is set, provides a
usefully choppy rhythmic accompaniment and a richly harsh and
raucous contrast to the smooth sleek equestrian dance.
</P>
<P>
   Bartabas, the company's founder and artistic director, has the
eye of an inspired fashion artist. The performing space at times
resembles a giant yin-yang pattern. A dark outer ring and floury
white center ring set off a careful mixing and contrasting of black
and white human performers in black and white costumes performing
with mostly black, white and gray horses. (One of the most dazzling
visual effects consists of the sudden introduction of brownish
charcoal costume panels in a duet with a similarly colored horse.
The small throws or blankets that cover the horses' haunches match
the animals' colorings in ways that are just as subtly beautiful.)
</P>
<P>
   The lighting, by an uncredited designer, creates the effect of
shifting pools of gray and white light and darkness that suggest
the various stages of an eclipse of the moon. And the visual
designs are enhanced by handsome costumes, created by
Marie-Laurence Schakmundes, that were inspired by Korean
traditional robes and hats.
</P>
<P>
   But the heart of the show is the horses, tiny and massive,
galloping and idling, with lustrous coats and flying manes and
tails of straight and curling hair.
</P>
<P>
   Bartabas is at his best when he is simplest, particularly in his
staging of the horses, whose unforced-looking performing glows with
an unsentimental love for and understanding of the beasts.
</P>
<P>
   Zingaro, the large black lead horse, settles into a recline so
slowly that one can see every rippling strand of muscle down the
length of his body. Nuzzling equine bodies curl and circle close
around standing humans. Large hairy muzzles draw close to nibble at
the tiny orange glow of carrots revealed in raised hands that
protrude suddenly from voluminous wings.
</P>
<P>
   A small delicate black horse dances a flirtatious duet with a
human in a crimped white robe, suddenly nipping his bottom at a
particularly earnest moment in the dance. A cantering horse peers
regularly into the audience as if searching for a familiar face.
Most of all, there are the sudden appearances of the horses, dark
shadows racing through the darkness of the outer ring.
</P>
<P>
   But the human choreography is for the most part anemic and
anticlimactic, though there is a spectacularly exciting bareback
acrobatic routine toward the end. The pansori arm movements look
ridiculous when belabored as dance. There is far too much
repetition. And Bartabas skims rather casually through a very
specific cultural tradition.
</P>
<P>
   He makes skillful use of the ancient shamanistic music performed
by the pansori singer Yoo Jin Chung and a six-person ensemble
playing traditional instruments. But his incorporation of Pan-Asian
stereotypes, like the frequent coolie-scurrying and an impolitic
bit of wafting for kimono-clad figures from Japanese classical
dance, is both ill-informed and arrogant.

 &HT;    GLENN JOINS EFFORT TO KEEP THE AGED HEALTHY THROUGH EXERCISE
 &HT;    By SHANNON JOYCE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At 77, Sen. John Glenn is fit enough to blast off
in the space shuttle, and he hopes to get others over 50 out of
their homes and exercising.
</P>
<P>
   While not every senior in America can orbit the Earth, Glenn
said Thursday that many can stall the effects of aging and lead a
healthier life if they keep to a steady exercise regimen.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn joined forces with the National Institute on Aging (NIA)
and NASA, the two agencies backing his shuttle mission's geriatric
research, to release a free, comprehensive guide telling Americans
over 50 how to ease into a more active lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exercise your body,'' Glenn said, ``It just makes you feel
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Since plans for the senator's flight became public in January,
Glenn, NASA, and the National Institute of Aging have pushed the
scientific importance of sending a septuagenarian into orbit. Glenn
said many of the temporary ailments of space flight mirror health
problems that occur with age.
</P>
<P>
   Sleeplessness, weakening of the bones, loss of muscle tissue and
muscle atrophy plague the aged and astronauts alike, but once back
on Earth, astronauts' bodies slowly return to normal.
</P>
<P>
   NASA doctors know from experience that exercise reduces the
severity of those symptoms in astronauts, and NIA research shows
the same is true for older people.

   ``These changes occur as you get older, and probably these
symptoms are lifestyle-related'' NASA physician Joan Verikos said.
If they are, Verikos said, the problems could be prevented with a
more active lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn said many people, old and young, believe the key to an
active lifestyle is an expensive gym membership or pricey exercise
equipment. But Glenn, who speed-walks two miles a day and lifts
weights, said the change is less costly and more simple than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you have to do is walk around the block. If you can only
do it once, walk around the block once,'' Glenn said. The important
part, he said, is to do it every day. Once that becomes too easy,
Glenn said, take another lap.
</P>
<P>
   The 100-page book, Exercise: A Guide from the National Institute
on Aging , gives a step-by-step approach to leading a more active
life. The book details four types of physical activity, gives
examples of each, and outlines safety issues and nutrition. On
on-line version of the book has animated demonstrations of the
recommended exercises.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Some of the suggestions are familiar advice such as taking the
stairs and carrying golf clubs. But many everyday tasks such as
raking leaves, shoveling snow and dancing can build endurance and
better health.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hodes, the NIA director, said the recommendations in the
book are based on scientific research showing exercise can reduce
effects of many of the health problems that occur with age. The
exercises in the book include weight lifting to help build bone
mass to fight osteoporosis, balance exercises to prevent bad falls,
simple cardiovascular activities to strengthen the heart, and
stretches to prevent injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Hodes said most people should be able to undertake the easier
exercises in the book, but people with chronic diseases such as
diabetes or congestive heart failure or heart disease, or a family
history of one, should check with a doctor first.
</P>
<P>
   To order the book, call the National Institute of Aging at
1-800-222-2225 or (TTY) 1-800-222-4225, or e-mail the NIA at
niainfo(at)access.digex.net. The guide will be posted on the NASA
Web site http://weboflife.arc.nasa.gov/exerciseandaging/.

AUSTIN, Texas: for the picture. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The mercado itself will be a huge, rambling thing. My system is
to take the outer rows first. Circle the whole outer area, then go
up and down the rows. The mercados are not as frantic as the
streets, and people will not be putting a hard sell on you. By this
time, you've become something of an expert in the types of
souvenirs you may want to buy. So you're ready to bargain. The
phrase to use is, ``The guy over there had it for _'' and then put
in a number that's less than what the person you're speaking to
wants to charge.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry about offending this person. They expect
negotiation, like a car salesman does in the United States. Always
in Mexico, the border towns especially, this is understood by them,
and they think you understand it, too. If you don't negotiate, they
think less of you. Hey, they're already judging you by what you're
wearing. You don't want to wear plaid shorts. Not the right look.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there any other way to get lower prices?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you like more than one thing in his booth, ask him what
he'd charge if you bought this thing and then this other one, too.
He'll usually go lower. Also, time of day is important. Look all
you want in the morning and early afternoon, but wait until late
afternoon to buy. If he hasn't sold much all day, well, he doesn't
want to go home without any money, and he'll bargain down pretty
low. And if he's had a good day, then he might be in the mood to
sell something a little cheaper than he usually would.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can we best judge the quality of black-velvet paintings?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, there are distinct categories. They've always got the
nudes, and then landscapes with maybe some cactus. Then, a category
you just don't see too much anymore, one of my favorites _ a skull
and maybe skeleton posed with the items that probably caused it to
lose its flesh, liquor bottles or guns or whatever. Then, the guys
who look like banditos. There are the cartoon characters like
Tweety. Bullfights. Finally, celebrities. Elvis. John Wayne. Pretty
soon, I imagine they'll have Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   As you make the rounds of the shops and the mercado booths, even
to those without trained eyes it ought to become pretty obvious
which paintings on black velvet were just dashed off in a couple of
hours and which are really good. Here's a tip _ most of them come
with frames. Ask how much they are without the frames. You can
always put your own frame on later.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget there are other images besides ones on black velvet
that make good souvenirs. Postcards are good. Older ones,
especially. Lots of bright colors, inexpensive, and, unlike monster
sombreros, they fit in overhead compartments of planes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You alluded earlier to stuffed frogs and other critters ...
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, the stuffed critters. No matter how much you're tempted,
don't get a stuffed skunk. Bad idea. In fact, don't buy any of 'em
with long fur. You don't know how long they've just been sitting
out there. Remember, little bugs just love to live in these
taxidermied critters. Some people say to put the stuffed critters
in the freezer for three days after you get home. That'll kill any
little bugs. But watch out for the long fur, too.
</P>
<P>
   The best ones to buy, I think, are the interesting ones. A
squirrel, maybe. Stuffed frogs have traditionally been my
favorites, but try to find stuffed armadillos. They're getting
rare.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Here's an obvious question. If we shop right, are we spending
a lot of money or just a little?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's not too bad if you negotiate. A really good velvet
painting should not be over 25 bucks, especially if you have them
take the frame off. Stuffed armadillo, about the same. A single
stuffed frog, let's say six bucks. The photo of you and the striped
donkeys, well, you might have to go to eight bucks for that.

DADDY-O WADE'S TIPS FOR SHOPPING MEXICO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Bob ``Daddy-O'' Wade, 55, is among Texas' most
famous artists. His eclectic works range from giant sculpted
iguanas to delicate posters, and almost always thematically reflect
Texas or its neighbor, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Wade has long been fascinated by Mexican arts and crafts; for
one show financed by the National Endowment for the Arts, he
purchased two dozen black-velvet paintings to include in the
exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   Still a regular visitor to Mexico, Wade agreed to share some of
his shopping insights and tips with ``Star-Telegram'' readers in a
question-and-answer session. Sipping icy Coronas at a Mexican
restaurant in his hometown of Austin, Wade emerged as a sort of
souvenir-buying Everyman, one who likes to temper common sense with
fun-filled, margarita-fueled consumerism.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Question: Don't most people who buy cheap souvenirs in Mexico
end up throwing the stuff out after they get home?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Some things do look fabulous in Tijuana or Juarez after
you've had a couple of margaritas, then don't look so good when you
get home. But that's part of the fun. If you're in Mexico and you
see something you like, get it. You should have your own special
place at home that's your personal, quirky, eccentric area to
decorate. Besides, some of the best Mexican stuff is getting harder
to find. For instance, stuffed frogs. Little critters they bop over
the head and stuff with urethane foam. Gotta get those whenever you
can.
</P>
<P>
   And sombreros. Everybody needs to own at least one sombrero. I
have one friend in San Antonio who's got 2,000. But be careful when
you buy one. On every plane back to the United States from Mexico,
there's always one guy who has to wear his sombrero because when he
bought it, he didn't realize it was too big to fit into the plane's
overhead compartment.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How should we avoid being overwhelmed in Mexico by all the
vendors clamoring and shoving stuff in our faces?
</P>
<P>
   A: Most tourist towns have what they call ``mercados,'' markets.
These are places away from the hotels. The shops between the hotels
and the mercado charge more, probably. The mercados are great, row
after row of booths and cubicles selling great stuff. The people
selling stuff closer by the hotel don't want you to pass them by
and go there. So they put a lot more pressure on you to make an
instant deal than the vendors in the mercado will do.
</P>
<P>
   So the way to do it is, look in the fancier stores on your way
to the mercado. But cruise through quick. The people in the stores
will be trying to sell you something, but don't make eye contact
with them. Be very polite. Tell them thanks, you'll be back later.
That will already bring their prices down. They'll probably say, if
they were asking 10 dollars for something, `Hey, buy it now and you
can have it for eight.' But don't buy anything yet.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Because you're still going to get better prices at the
mercado?
</P>
<P>
   A: That, and also because you don't want to have to lug a bunch
of stuff around. Some of the Mexican stuff is bulky, like sombreros
or steer horns or stuffed armadillos. If you see and want something
large, always buy that last.
</P>
<P>
   Q: OK, you've made it to the mercado. What then?
</P>
<P>
   A: Just about when you get there, you're going to see a place to
have your picture taken on a cart with some donkeys in front of it.
The donkeys will have painted stripes on them. Get on the seat of
the cart and have your picture taken. Trust me, you'll love that
picture to the end of your days. It'll be one of the best souvenirs
you'll ever have. There's just something about those striped
donkeys, especially if they loan you a big sombrero to wear for the
picture.

`NO EXIT': IN AN EXISTENTIALIST'S HELL, THREE IS STILL A CROWD 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By WILBORN HAMPTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jean-Paul Sartre called his particular brand of
existentialist drama the ``theater of situations,'' and there are
few more terrifying situations in modern theater than the one he
devised for ``No Exit,'' his searing 1944 play that is being
revived by the Jean Cocteau Repertory.
</P>
<P>
   Three recently deceased strangers find themselves thrown
together in hell, damned to spend eternity in one another's company
in a locked, brightly lighted room that has _ an important detail _
no mirrors. They can only see themselves through one another's
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The first to arrive is Garcin, a journalist; he is followed by
Inez, a lesbian who is not happy to find herself alone forever with
a man, and then by Estelle, an attractive socialite.
</P>
<P>
   The three stalk one another around the room like tigers in a
cage, telling their stories while occasionally glancing back to
earthly life to follow what is going on among their survivors. At
first, each has a sympathetic tale: Garcin was shot in prison for
his pacifist activities; Inez died in a gas accident; Estelle had
married a wealthy older man but had stayed with him.
</P>
<P>
   But as time passes, the truth begins to come out. Garcin was
executed for deserting the military and had abused his wife; Inez
seduced the wife of her cousin, then drove her to suicide; Estelle
had a child from an adulterous affair, then killed the baby to get
revenge on her lover. They ARE all in hell, after all, not the
other place.
</P>
<P>
   Sex soon enters the equation. Inez lusts after the beautiful
Estelle, who is attracted to Garcin, who in turn finds he needs
assurances from the women that he was not a coward.
</P>
<P>
   It slowly becomes clear that each of the three is to be the
punishment for the other two. The atmosphere of tension builds to a
final outburst that so binds the three in their menage of fury and
frustration that they are unable to flee it even when the door of
their cell is suddenly thrown open. Better the hell you know than
the abyss you don't.
</P>
<P>
   The Cocteau revival is uneven at best. It only infrequently
achieves the sense of foreboding that should pervade the entire
play, and the performances, under David Travis' direction, never
fully explore the depths of depravity to which one may be driven by
simple vanity or by the horror in realizing that one's life will be
judged by strangers. ``Hell,'' as Garcin famously concludes, ``is
other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Travis sets a pace and tone for his actors that seems more
suited to a television sitcom than the menacing machinations of
three ruthless souls bound forever in torment. Indeed, some
exchanges are played for laughs. Admittedly, a surprisingly
pedestrian translation by the novelist Paul Bowles offers little in
the way of inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   And the final scene, in which the passions of all three are at
last unleashed, if only to prove their ultimate impotence, is taut
and partly salvages the staging.
</P>
<P>
   Elise Stone is the best of the three as Inez, the ``tough
customer'' who finds she ``needs to see people suffer to know I
exist.'' Charles Parnell is striking as Garcin and has some
rewarding moments, especially in his scenes with Ms. Stone. Tracy
Atkins is never really believable as Estelle, playing a woman
capable of killing her own child to spite a lover as though she
were a cunning little vixen. Tim Deak delivers a fine turn as the
Nazi-like bellboy who escorts each to their damnation.

   ABOUT-CARS-ISUZU-NYT (Undated) _ The new 1998 Isuzu Amigo (the
old model rode into the sunset in 1994) still comes with a canvas
top and soft plastic windows in the back. But a hard-roof option is
due this summer, as a 1999 model. Moreover, both the softtop and
hardtop versions offer more of what appealed to buyers of the old
Amigo, plus an optional dose of muscle and luxury. By Peter
Passell. With Photo.

   CAR-SMART-KIA-NYT (Undated) _ It's cheap, it's cute and the top
comes off: What's not to like? Too much, alas. For while the 1999
Kia Sportage two-door convertible from Korea is certainly ready to
deliver fun, for the beach-blanket crowd, there's no mistaking it
for the more polished, car-like miniature sport utilities from
Japan. By Peter Passell. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   AUTO-REVIEW-AZR (Undated) _ Has it really been 10 years since
the Mazda Miata single-handedly reignited America's enthusiasm for
lightweight roadsters, years after the British had packed up their
little sports cars and gone home? Miata remains a singular
expression of sports-car virtue. Others have tried but missed the
mark. A recent flurry of German roadsters from BMW, Porsche and
Mercedes-Benz may eclipse the Miata in performance, but they cost
twice as much. And they probably wouldn't exist if Miata had not
paved the way. By Bob Golfen.
</P>
<P>
   EURASIA-AUTOSCAM (South Portland, Maine) _ When Howard Patterson
strode to the podium here last month, he was applauded wildly by
several dozen car dealers, each of whom had paid from $25,000 to
$60,000 to acquire a franchise for the fledgling Eurasia Motor
Corp. of Fort Lauderdale, Fla. ``I think it was a scam from the
very beginning,'' said Chuck Pond, owner of Action Automotive in
Mobile, Ala., who is one of at least nine dealers who are suing or

   LIBERAL-PRIEST (Rochester, N.Y.) _ When the Rev. James Callan

that also moved so far away from standard church practices

Assemblies,'' his 1961 book, cast a cold eye on the postwar
religious revival still in full bloom. His latest salvo is in the
current issue of The Christian Century, the journal of liberal
Protestantism. Berger, director of the Institute for the Study of
Economic Culture at Boston University, began by confessing one big
error in his early thinking: that modernity necessarily leads to a
decline in religion. By Peter Steinfels.

Religion'' appears in almost 100 newspapers)

 &HT;    
 By MIKE McMANUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    I received a call today from a man whose wife has ''shut down.''
She feels the marriage is hopeless, and wants out. After years of
trying to make the marriage work, of trying to establish meaningful
communication with her husband, a quiet man who acknowledges he was
not responsive to her, she has given up.
 &HT;    Now that his marriage hangs by a thread, her husband is shocked
and willing to make any changes such as doing more housework. For
her, it is too late.
 &HT;    She is wrong. Her husband loves her, and did not realize how
unhappy she was. Now he will do anything to save the marriage. But
she does not believe his contrition is genuine.
 &HT;    I told him his marriage could probably be saved if he can
persuade her to attend a Retrouvaille weekend, a retreat run by
volunteers whose own marriages nearly failed. Retrouvaille (800
470-2230) saves four out of five marriages headed for divorce -- a
far higher percentage than is achieved by marital therapists --
according to Diane Sollee, former associate director of the
American Association of Marriage and Family Therapy.
 &HT;    But there must be a better way to help women who find their
marriages discouraging, before they set their minds on divorce.
After all, two-thirds of divorces are filed by women.
 &HT;    That why I'm excited by a new book by Michele Weiner-Davis with
the snappy title: ''A Woman's Guide to Changing Her Man (without
his even knowing it).''
 &HT;    It begins by describing ''what irks women about men -- their
lack of interest in communicating, their tendency to misprioritize
work, family and outside interests, their insistence on being
right.''
 &HT;    But she's honest about what irks men about women -- their
tendency to nag to the point of having men tune out.
 &HT;    And her basic message is one men would like, of wives
transforming their marriages by transforming themselves.
 &HT;    ''We make the mistake of approaching our men as if they're just
like us,'' she writes. Men are not as interested in talking about
relationships as women, she notes. For men, the purpose of talk is
to solve a problem. Men are goal and action-oriented, she writes in
a chapter, ''Testosterone Simplified.''
 &HT;    And Mrs. Weiner-Davis is funny, suggesting women remember how
they house-train puppies: compliment them for positive behavior and
ignore the accidents. ''Tonight I want you to go home and pretend
your husband is a puppy. Men learn faster with positive rewards for
good behavior. We expect guys to get it right, so when they do, we
say nothing. When they screw up, we nail them. Rarely do we say
things like `When you helped me put the kids to bed last night, it
really made a difference. I appreciate it a lot.'''
 &HT;    Just as dogs are trained best with one-word commands, ''Sit''
and ''Down,'' so men prefer clear requests. Instead of long-winded
complaints about her need for ''more closeness,'' a wife should
say, ''I need you to kiss me in the morning when you wake up and
kiss me when you come home from work.''
 &HT;    She suggests women become ''solution detectives.'' A woman
married to a pilot found it very difficult to deal with his long
absences. She complained constantly, making him dread coming home.
 &HT;    Mrs. Weiner-Davis, a therapist, asked her, ''What's the
difference when you don't feel so unhappy?'' The woman said she
felt better when he called home more often. So she made the obvious
suggestion that he call home more often. He was glad to do so.
 &HT;    ''We can become astute observers of what works, and what is
good,'' she writes. A woman said her husband, Bob, ''never'' spent
time with their son Joey. The therapist asked what they did do
together. The mother said Bob did take Joey to his soccer games.
She suggested he sign up for Little League, giving the two more
time together in male-bonding sports.
 &HT;    Another suggestion: ''Do Something Different.'' One couple
decided the next time they had an argument, they would have to take
off their clothes! They did it and found themselves laughing.
 &HT;    A woman whose husband often woke up angry and grumbling, tried
something new. She sent him flowers at work, with a note that she
loved him. He immediately called, asking for an explanation.
 &HT;    ''After you left, I thought about how much stress you have been
under, so I sent some flowers to brighten your day!'' He thanked
her profusely, and apologized for his anger.
 &HT;    This is a book struggling wives should buy. What about husbands?
Michele's previous best-seller, ''Divorce Busting.''

 &HT;    COLUMN: Photographers' talents abound in city `Scenes'
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You don't catch me being excited over every book that comes my
way. There are so many of them nowadays they constitute a traffic
hazard. You have to step high, wide and handsome to get over the
stacks.
</P>
<P>
   All are tempting, many tantalizing. If you just had time, I
think _ but then comes a package and lack of time is no deterrent.
It's a book you're ecstatic to see, one you wouldn't miss for
anything.
</P>
<P>
   Such a book is in my hands today, and if I can swing the $16 per
copy price, I want to give it to all my friends and relations.
</P>
<P>
   It's called ``Atlanta Scenes,'' presenting pictures by some of
my old buddies, our staff photographers, of news stories and
interesting scenes in 60 years of Atlanta history.
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly Blass, editorial director of the Atlanta History
Center, and Michael Rose picked pictures from the collections of
Francis Price, Kenneth Rogers, Marion Johnson and Bill Wilson and
equipped them with full informative captions _ and the result will
thrill Atlantans who know the eras represented and, I hope,
interest everybody else. Proceeds from book sales will go to the
Atlanta History Center.
</P>
<P>
   For me the book is doubly interesting. I covered some of the
stories told here and three of the photographers _ Rogers, Wilson
and Johnson _ were among my first friends and most valued
co-workers in Atlanta. I had never worked with a photographer when
I came to the Atlanta Constitution. I thought the presence of one
when you were trying to interview somebody or elicit information
from a reluctant source would complicate matters. How wrong I was!
Photographers were more often than not a real help in getting the
story and always amenable to suggestions for photo angles.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find most of your cherished landmarks in this slender
paperback _ Terminal station, busy streetcar-filled streets, Ponce
de Leon Park, mountain and coastal scenes _ and some you hate to
remember: the burning Winecoff and Terminal Hotels. Loew's Grand
and the ``Gone With the Wind'' premiere are here, along with
pictures of Clark Gable making Margaret Mitchell laugh. I love the
picture of aviator Charles Lindbergh, so young and handsome, being
honored in Atlanta and Eleanor Roosevelt, hatted and coated out of
all reason, climbing into an airplane. There are WPA crews at work,
politicians in action, courtroom scenes of the Leo Frank trial, the
last of Atlanta's Confederate generals.
</P>
<P>
   One of the nice things these editors have done is start each
chapter with a brief biography and picture of the photographer.
Since all are dead now (Marion Johnson died this summer), it's
great to have shots of them as you remember them _ young, mostly
handsome and hard at work.
</P>
<P>
   I did not know Francis Price. He died in 1928 but he took some
notable pictures. One of the first aerial pictures is his, a shot
of the 1917 Atlanta fire. I believe, with the editors, that these
pictures capture much of Atlanta's history and ``convey, as perhaps
no other media can, a sense of the time and place they chronicle.''
</P>
<P>
   The book's last chapter has shots taken by great staff members
who are not specifically covered in this book, including three
women, Carolyn McKenzie (now Carter), Bessie Walker Callaway and
Edna Weston.
</P>
<P>
   Arcadia Publishing of Dover, N.H., may be the place to order
this book, but I'm counting on our local booksellers to have a
plenteous stock. Now, for $16 each for a dozen copies!

 &HT;    CDC's report is food for thought
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA_Sunny-side up eggs and Caesar salads are still high on
the list of some American's favorite foods, despite their known
salmonella risk, concludes a survey taken in eight states about
high-risk food consumption and handling.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 50 percent of people said they ate undercooked eggs
during the previous 12 months, according to a report released
Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a worrisome percentage of people ate undercooked
hamburgers, which can harbor deadly E. coli O157:H7, and others did
not wash their hands with soap before preparing food. The survey
was done after the 1993 Jack in the Box E. coli outbreak in the
Northwest that sickened 700 people, and killed four children, but
before the 1997 Hudson beef episode that ended up in the recall of
25 million pounds of ground beef. Both received wide media
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Completed by telephone during 1995 and 1996, the survey asked
19,356 adults in Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Missouri, New Jersey,
New York, South Dakota, and Tennessee, a dozen questions about
handling food, eating, and awareness of food-safety labels on
packages. Researchers hesitated to extrapolate the results to
Americans at large but they said the findings shed light on
numerous public awareness campaigns aimed at reducing food
poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is any indication of what's going on across the
country, then it proves there's still a lot more food-safety
education that needs to be done,'' said Samantha Yang, CDC
epidemiologist and lead author of the report. ``I was most
surprised by the number of people still eating undercooked eggs.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the increasing number of salmonella cases in recent
years, health officials advise people not to eat eggs unless they
are throughly cooked and the yolks are hard.
</P>
<P>
   Men were more likely than women to engage in risky behavior when
eating and preparing food, the survey found, and whites were more
likely than African-Americans to eat pink hamburgers (22 percent
compared with 6.5 percent.) To reduce E. coli risks, hamburgers
must be cooked to at least 160 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Between 6.5 million to 33 million people annually become sick
from what they eat, and up to 9,000 die, the CDC estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was completed as part of a federal effort to better
understand consumers and restaurant foodhandlers' habits. Among
those surveyed: 20 percent reported eating pink hamburgers; 24
percent eating home-canned vegetables and 8 percent had eaten raw
oysters. Botulism can result from fruits or vegetables not being
properly cooked before canning or from not properly sealing the
jars. Raw oysters are major carriers of vibrio, a newly-recognized
threat in water.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's either preferences, tastes, cultural background or people
really don't know (the foods are considered unsafe)'', Yang said
about why some people are still eating potentially dangerous
dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Also of concern is the numbers of adults not following standard
food-handling practices, which can lead to others getting sick.
When asked about preparing raw meat and chicken, 19 percent
reported not washing hands with soap and nearly 20 percent did not
wash a cutting board with soap or bleach after each use, the only
way to prevent meat and poultry from contaminating other foods.

properly cooked before canning or from not properly sealing the
jars. Raw oysters are major carriers of vibrio, a newly-recognized
threat in water.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's either preferences, tastes, cultural background or people
really don't know (the foods are considered unsafe)'', Yang said
about why some people are still eating potentially dangerous
dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Also of concern is the numbers of adults not following standard
food-handling practices, which can lead to others getting sick.
When asked about preparing raw meat and chicken, 19 percent
reported not washing hands with soap and nearly 20 percent did not
wash a cutting board with soap or bleach after each use, the only
way to prevent meat and poultry from contaminating other foods.

 &HT;    Prime time's racial divide continues to widen, and the networks
seem reluctant to improve the situation.
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service

<P>
   We're movin' on. But are we movin' on up?
</P>
<P>
   On tonight's new sitcom ``Living in Captivity'' (8 p.m. EDT on
Fox), a black couple move into an all-white, gated suburban
community and find their next-door neighbor has a black lawn jockey
in his yard. They retaliate with a white lawn jockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hughleys'' (premiering Sept. 22 on ABC) focuses on another
African-American family moving into an all-white suburb. When
Darryl, the dad, goes out for his paper, he's offended by an
elderly white woman who asks if he would take her trash down to the
curb. Turns out she's not racist: She asks all her neighbors for
such assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Two new TV sitcoms about integration may not be a huge trend,
but it's two more than TV usually has. Don't assume, however, that
everyone thinks that's necessarily upward movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very fact that 'Living in Captivity' and 'The Hughleys'
are playing now, in 1998, shows how far behind television really
is,'' says Robert Thompson, director of the Center for the Study of
Popular Television at Syracuse University(N.Y.).
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an idea afoot that television sets the agenda in
society,'' Thompson says. ``But it doesn't push any envelopes. It
waits 5, 10, 15 years and then licks envelopes that have already
been pushed.''
</P>
<P>
   Says J. Fred MacDonald, author of ``Blacks and White TV'':
``Integration is passe to many black intellectuals. It's much too
little and much too late.''
</P>
<P>
   But D.L. Hughley, the African-American stand-up comic who
co-produces and stars in ``The Hughleys,'' says such critics are
missing the point: ``This is an issue that's a hot potato, and that
is always going to be with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the ongoing dialogue on race on television, one
that's every bit as complex and sometimes polarized as the national
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   TV's fall season rolls out 36 new series, none of which have
predominantly African-American casts. That may actually count as
progress, however, rather than a step backward, given that most
shows with black casts have been, in MacDonald's judgment,
``ghettoized.'' With some exceptions (``Cosby''), they tend to be
broad sitcoms that play on the less-established networks (once Fox,
now WB and UPN).
</P>
<P>
   The major networks, meanwhile, seem to have less and less
interest in putting African-Americans into prime-time shows. On the
eight new series on CBS and the six new shows on NBC, there is not
one major black character.
</P>
<P>
   The result of this prime-time division of the races can be seen
Sunday night on the Emmy Awards. Only one black actor,
``Homicide's'' Andre Braugher, is listed among the 20 nominees for
best actor or actress in a comedy or drama series. There are no
African-Americans among the 10 nominees for best supporting
actor/actress in a comedy series, and three out of 10 (``ER's''
Eriq LaSalle and Gloria Reuben and ``Touched by an Angel's'' Della
Reese) for best supporting actor or actress in a drama series.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a ghetto mentality,'' says Thompson. ``There's a
neighborhood where 'Friends' and 'Frasier' live, and a neighborhood
where 'Sister, Sister' lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there are no all-black shows coming this fall, there is
a mini-trend toward more integrated casts. Veteran actors Joe
Morton and Robert Guillaume have roles in, respectively, UPN's
``Mercy Point'' and ABC's ``Sports Night.'' And then there's ``The
Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer,'' a bizarre new UPN sitcom about
a black British butler serving Abraham Lincoln in the White House
during the Civil War. It's already come under fire from some
African-Americans offended by its racial humor, including a scene
on a slave ship that was removed from the pilot.
</P>
<P>
   African-American comedies, says Thompson, face an impossibly
high standard. ``You're supposed to be funny and entertaining and
at the same time carry the standard of your entire race. Everything
should be positive and beneficial. That's an enormous burden.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a burden Hughley understands. His show has taken flak
already for a few jokes about African-Americans not paying their
bills on time.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say that I've never experienced that in my life, or anybody
I knew hadn't, that would be untrue,'' Hughley says. ``I'm not
doing a show that is a collective voice for black people in
general, I'm doing a show that speaks for my voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the most unfair things I see,'' Hughley
continues, ``is that people always expect a show with an
African-American cast to do something other than what it is
intended to do.''
</P>
<P>
   So television finds itself sometimes assailed on all fronts, for
not being honest about race or for being honest but giving offense.
Interracial romances, for example, enjoyed a brief fling last
season, portrayed on ``Ally McBeal,'' ``ER'' and ``Brooklyn
South.'' But ``Murphy Brown'' producer Diane English, who created
``Living in Captivity,'' recalls a few seasons ago when Murphy
dated an African-American executive at her network. ``It really
didn't go over well with the black female community,'' she says.
``We got bags of mail.''
</P>
<P>
   There are signs of hope. Dramas like ``Homicide'' and ``NYPD
Blue'' frequently deal with race and racism, or simply portray
complex African-American characters in ways where race is not an
issue.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also almost impossible to imagine a major network doing
a ``Roots'' today, and Marcy Carsey, whose production company made
``The Cosby Show,'' wonders if even that landmark series would make
it on the air and be accepted by all audiences now the way it was
in the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one years ago tonight, the Emmy Awards were held, and
``Roots'' won nine Emmys out of 37 nominations, both a record for a
miniseries. (It might have won more but many of the stars were
pitted against each other.) On Sunday, of the 44 Emmy presenters
NBC has announced, four are black.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it as the television industry's own little lawn jockey.

 &HT;    ``Living in Captivity'' not great, but it doesn't hold you
hostage, either
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The suburbs are supposed to be safe, serene and sanitized.
Thankfully the new Fox sitcom ``Living in Captivity'' (8 EDT
tonight) is anything but.
</P>
<P>
   Set in the gated, all-white Los Angeles subdivision of Woodland
Hills, tonight's promising pilot deals with the arrival of Curtis
Cook (Dondre T. Whitfield) and his very-pregnant wife Tamara (Kira
Arne), the neighborhood's first black couple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hear that sound honey,'' bigot-next-door Carmine ``The Muffler
King'' Santucci asks his blonde trophy wife, Lisa. ``That's the
sound of our property values dropping 20 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Living on the other side of the Cooks are the Mareks: wimpy
liberal novelist Will (Matthew Letscher) and his wife Becca
(Melinda McGraw), an emasculating Jewish lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the characters are painfully obvious stereotypes. But
that's a minor sin that deserves forgiveness because of some
wickedly clever writing and actors restrained enough to keep the
show from losing its firm grip on suburban surreality.
</P>
<P>
   One of the funniest scenes has Will jogging with Curtis, and
later confessing that it reminds him of being chased by a black
mugger when he was still living in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a sexual thing,'' Will assures Curtis in an
ill-advised bout of candor. ``If it was a sexual thing I'd let you
catch me.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a fixation on race and sex in the pilot, subsequent
episodes deal with the swirling neuroses that consume many
suburbanites, especially crime. One re-current character says he's
considering buying a shotgun for home protection after a robbery:
``because it sprays, which means you'll hit something even if you
can't find your glasses.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other fledgling shows on Fox, this one is uneven in spots.
And it also may wind up competing for attention with the ``The
Hughleys'' _ another ``guess
-who's-coming-to-the-homeowner's-meeting'' sitcom debuting this
season on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   But at a time when more Americans are retreating behind the
safety of their garage door openers, ``Living'' gets credit for at
least planting subversive seeds of humor in a TV landscape
overgrown with crabgrass.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   SEEN AND HEARD
</P>
<P>
   Headline goes here
</P>
<P>
   Memo to metro Atlanta viewers: If the camera crew from ``Cops''
ever knocks on your door, for heavens sake put a shirt on.
</P>
<P>
   The Emmy-winning reality show that shoots (video) first and asks
questions later visited Atlanta earlier this year, and they were so
impressed with our fine selection of criminals and victims, they
chose to spotlight the city in the season premiere (8 p.m. EDT
Saturday on FOX), and in another episode airing next week.
</P>
<P>
   It's been 11 seasons since the show began going from
city-to-city documenting law enforcement officers and their often
bare-chested clientele. As a ``Cops'' press release cheerfully
points out, the show has lasted longer than ``MASH'', ``Gunsmoke''
and ``Happy Days.''
</P>
<P>
   That's depressing, but it's easy to see why. As guilty pleasures
go ``Cops'' is at its best when we're at our worst.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the trademark ``Bad Boys'' reggae theme song and a
slam-bang opening sequence, the Atlanta installments lack the
gritty action true ``Cops'' fans expect.
</P>
<P>
   The first show features a disturbed man wearing a shotgun
necktie holding police at bay for hours before he's subdued by a
flash bomb and taser, and a Notre Dame- educated Zone 3 officer,
Jeff Glazier, who discovers a fatal gunshot victim slumped in a
car.
</P>
<P>
   All seems lost until the action switches to Fulton County, where
officer Debbie Banker is answering a domestic call. She raps on the
apartment door and viola!: the obligatory shirtless guy appears.
She just wants to talk, he just wants to be not talked to. We just
want him to get dressed.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C (with no hope of parole)
</P>
<P>
   Castro reminisces
</P>
<P>
   CNN is scheduled to take a time-out from its coverage of
President Clinton's woes at 8 p.m. EDT Sunday to air a one-hour
special, ``Castro: In His Own Words.'' Pat Mitchell, president of
CNN Productions, taped a five-hour interview with the Cuban
president in the spring as part of CNN's upcoming documentary
series ``Cold War.'' Although Castro said little that made news on
the contemporary scene, his reminiscences about the Cuban Missile
Crisis and the 30 years of Soviet-Cuban relations were interesting
enough that CNN decided to air them in a special, rather than just
as edited sound-bites in ``Cold War.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Still mad about ``MAD TV''
</P>
<P>
   With Howard Stern's CBS Saturday night show setting new lows in
taste (and laughs), ``MAD TV'' (11 p.m. ET Saturday on Fox) comes
roaring back, asking: What can we do that will really dance close
to the edge? The answer is a skit called ``There's Something About
Monica,'' a spoof combining the summer gross-out hit comedy
``There's Something About Mary'' and President Clinton's situation
(wittily dubbed by The New Republic ``Bimbroglio.'') The spoof
would probably just squeak by with a PG-13 at the movies, but
parents should be cautioned about letting teens watch. And there's
at least one big advantage over Stern _ unlike his latenight piece
of roadkill, ``MAD's'' Monica skit is hilarious. Viveca A. Fox and
Atlanta singer Usher guest star on the ``MAD'' season premiere.

 &HT;    4-hour show could rival Gilligan trip
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first Emmy Awards in 1948 weren't even televised nationally,
just in Los Angeles; just six awards were given.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody for turning back the clock?
</P>
<P>
   Not a chance. The Emmys may not have the star power of the
Oscars, the melodies of the Grammys or the body-piercing and
bleeped obscenities of the MTV Video Awards, but they're one of the
biggies in TV's ever-expanding awards universe, and they're getting
bigger this year.
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate Emmy's 50th anniversary, the show is expanding to
four hours. The number of on-air awards will stay the same _ 27 _
but there will be more packaged segments, such as television's Top
10 moments and ``It Seemed Like a Good Idea at the Time,'' a mock
tribute to unforgettables like ``My Mother, the Car.''
</P>
<P>
   The show is going hostless this year _ a bit strange for a
medium awash in talking heads _ but presenters scheduled to appear
include Whitney Houston, Chris Rock, Mary Tyler Moore, Tom Hanks,
Ted Danson, Garry Shandling, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jay Leno,
Michael J. Fox, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Jenna Elfman, David Duchovny,
Gillian Anderson and two teen throbs from ``Dawson's Creek,'' James
van der Beek and Katie Holmes.
</P>

   And the good news is, they promise it will be over at 11 p.m

AMBULANCE ACTIONS SHOW PROMISE, PROBLEMS IN ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN
TIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Before dawn Thursday, ambulances _ some with a red
crescent on the side, some with the Star of David _ raced through
southern Gaza to a bus crash. Palestinian and Israeli medics worked
side by side to treat about 50 injured Palestinian workers and rush
them to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the ambulance drivers were Jewish settlers from
neighboring enclaves who had never before set foot in
Palestinian-controlled Gaza and who usually travel to and from
their enclaves with army escorts.
</P>
<P>
   At a moment when many Israelis and Palestinians wonder whether
relations between them can ever be normalized, it was a stunningly
efficient collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   All but two of the workers, whose bus had slid off the road on
an oil slick, survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``In such emergencies, there are no differences between Arabs
and Jews,'' Mohammed Abu-Sabala, 28, a construction worker who
suffered a broken neck, said from his hospital bed at the Khan
Younis Hospital in southern Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem on Thursday, however, another incident involving
Israeli medics and Palestinians ended tragically, underscoring why
the cooperation in Gaza was the subject of daylong press attention
here. Usually, the movement of Israeli ambulances into Palestinian
communities is a tense affair.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, Kamleh Mohammed al-Nazer, 41, who was shot last
Saturday by Israeli security forces using rubber-encased bullets,
died. Mrs. Nazer, the single mother of four, was shot ``by
mistake,'' according to the Jerusalem police chief, during a
violent confrontation between the Israeli forces and youths in the
Arab neighborhood of Shuafat on the outskirts of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation followed the arrival of an Israeli ambulance
to pick up the body of a man who had died at the local clinic of a
heart attack. The clinic was surrounded by Palestinians who had
heard a rumor that the man had died because the ambulance had taken
too long to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   A human rights group, Physicians for Human Rights/Israel, has
complained in court that Israeli ambulances either do not respond
to emergencies in certain Palestinian neighborhoods or delay their
response. The ambulance drivers summon police escorts first.
</P>
<P>
   In the incident Saturday, the youths pelted the police escorts
with rocks and then firebombs. A man who said he was a witness,
Abedrado al-Fasfus, said the youths were provoked by police, who,
he said, shoved through the crowd to get into the clinic, knocking
two men to the ground and then summoning reinforcements. Police
said the youths attacked first and that the officers were stormed
and responded not only with rubber bullets but with live
ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Nazer had wandered into the melee on her way to buy
vegetables for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret the loss of life,'' Maj. Gen. Yair Yitzhaki said on
Israeli army radio Thursday. ``I have no doubt this woman was hit
by mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday afternoon, her body was returned to her small,
neat house where her neighbors waited, draped in white, to wrap her
for burial. When she was carried in through a cloud of incense,
women wailed and fainted. Palestinian photographers crushed so
closely around her that her daughters did not get to say goodbye
before she was whisked away to a mosque.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral procession remained calm. But emotions ran strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a Palestinian did that to an Israeli, they would put him in
jail and take away his house,'' said her cousin, Widad Shabani.
``Is this the will of God? Is this part of their peace process?''
</P>

   Against this backdrop of intense confrontations and
accommodations, Dennis Ross, the U.S. envoy to the Middle East, met
with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been bedridden with
the flu, in his home. Although tight-lipped about his visit, which
is an attempt to break an 18-month deadlock in the peace
negotiations, Ross has called his meetings here productive, and is
expected to stay at least another day.
</P>
<P>
   In the Gaza hospital, families of the Palestinian day laborers,
who had been on their way to work in Israel, surrounded their beds.
Many expressed their gratitude to the Israelis who, because an army
base and a Jewish settlement are so close by, arrived at the scene
before the Palestinian medics. Together they had set up a kind of
field hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has withdrawn from most of Gaza, although several
thousand Jewish settlers live in walled-off communities there in
the midst of about a million Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter asked the patients if it had felt odd to be
rescued by Israelis, one man became incensed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't make politics,'' he said. ``The Israelis did a good
thing.'' &QL;

CHEVROLET PICKUP SPORTY, PRACTICAL  
 (EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE SATURDAY, AUG. 12) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEND  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Take a basic Chevy S-10 fleet-side pickup, lower the
suspension, slap on body flares, add some custom rims and fat
tires, and whataya got?
</P>
<P>
   A sporty, practical and, most of all, affordable little truck
that's set up the way young dudes like them and that drives as well
as many sporty cars.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad way to spend 15 grand. It's cheaper and more practical
than a sports car, with similar visual and sensory effects.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the budget price has to do with the budget driveline, a
2.2-liter four-cylinder engine and five-speed stick shift. Not
exactly a hot setup, but competent, smooth-running, and with enough
pull for most purposes. Plus, a lot better gas mileage than with
automatic or the optional 4.3-liter V-6.
</P>
<P>
   The test truck was a two-wheel-drive street machine, definitely
not appropriate for off-highway use, though it could handle a dirt
road that's not too rutted.
</P>
<P>
   The little, red S-10 received many admiring looks from the
campus crowd, but adult types who need a small pickup for work or
chores should be glad to have one that looks so cool. It's fun to
drive and fun to be seen in, which should take the sting out of
having to tote a load of supplies in the pickup bed.
</P>
<P>
   This version of the S-10 demonstrates how Chevy has devised a
broad array of inexpensive custom possibilities for its popular
compact truck, ranging up to the high-performance SS model. GMC's
version, the Sonoma, has similar packages.
</P>
<P>
   The Chevy I drove had the LS interior package, with nice
upholstery, stereo, and other niceties, but without power windows,
locks or mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   To this was added the ZQ8 sport suspension package, which
includes the wheels and tires; frame reinforcements; lower ride
height; tougher shocks, bushings and stabilizer bars; and quicker
power steering. This is what creates the truck's crouchy look, firm
ride and improved handling. Load capacity is still 1,100 pounds,
Chevy says.
</P>
<P>
   And just for appearances, a package of plastic side and
wheel-well moldings is added on. I'm usually not too crazy about
plastic moldings, but these are small enough and integrated well
enough to be effective without being in your face.
</P>
<P>
   All told, a pretty handsome pickup, with features that would
cost a lot more for a driver to add aftermarket, and probably
wouldn't be as well-done. The suspension tweaks cost just $455 over
the base LS truck, with another $402 for a ``preferred equipment
group'' of the aluminum wheels, stereo system and interior
upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   The regular, non-extended cab is roomy and comfortable, more so
than I expected, with a brawny-looking dashboard that was
redesigned for '98 and carries over to '99. The bench seat allows
three-across seating, if you're all slim.
</P>
<P>
   The regular cab has serious limitations when it comes to
personal items, requiring just about anything you're carrying to
land in the bed, subject to the whims of weather and thieves. The
extended cab provides more stowage, stretch-out space and extra
seating for passengers (little ones, anyway), but the short cab has
a sportier look.
</P>
<P>
   The four-cylinder engine was surprisingly smooth. Acceleration
was OK, though there were times that I longed for more gumption. I
didn't carry any heavy loads or tackle any mountain grades, but I
think it would get along without too much fuss.
</P>
<P>
   The five-speed shifted nicely, mating well with the engine. If
equipped with a power-robbing automatic, the four-cylinder might be
giving up too much oomph to be very responsive or enjoyable. Chevy
rates towing capability with the four-banger at 1 ton, but I think
that's a stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The four-cylinder comes only with two-wheel drive, with the V-6
standard on the four-wheelers.
</P>
<P>
   The steering and handling are much improved over the
standard-issue S-10. Cornering is flat, but although the tires
stick well, the light pickup bed threatens to step out and come
around, if you're not careful.
</P>
<P>
   The test truck steered well but produced a clunk noise from the
front end when the wheel was turned full-lock either right or left.
</P>
<P>
   The brakes were disappointing. The four-wheel-drive models come
with all-wheel discs, but the rear-drivers have drums in back. The
stopping distances are long, with high effort. On the plus side,
anti-lock brakes are included in the base price, as they should be
in every vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   I caught my 13-year-old son eyeballing the test truck, and I
thought of how perfect it would be for him when he started driving.
Besides, I'd get to borrow it. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Chevrolet S-10 &QL; 
 &QL; 
- Vehicle type: Three-passenger, two-door pickup, rear-wheel
drive. &QL; 
- Base price:$13,179. &QL;

   COMMENTARY: If cats have nine lives, then this makes 27
</P>
<P>
   By Gary Borders
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   And now there are three.
</P>
<P>
   Bubba Gump showed up on the back porch last week _ hungry,
friendly, cute and unwilling to take my suggestion that he best
park his feline body someplace where two cats don't already rule
the roost.
</P>
<P>
   I'm easy, so it didn't take more than a few minutes of
concentratedcat-cuddling on his part before I was pulling the dry
food out of the pantry and pouring Bubba a generous helping out on
the back porch. He responded by enthusiastically trying to
head-butt my hand out of the way to get to the food, which he ate
in an amazingly short time, glancing around occasionally for
possible intruders.
</P>
<P>
   There are critters galore out here in the semi-country _ skinny
red foxes, a few deer who graze across the street early every
morning (ignoring me in stately fashion as I get the paper),
raccoons, possums, armadillos and way too many cats far wilder than
Bubba. I learned quickly upon moving here this summer to leave no
food outside, to be sure the garage door was down and the garbage
behind closed doors. Bubba's paranoia is justified. If I had
night-vision goggles, it would be fascinating to sit on the roof
and watch the critters circle the house at night, looking for food,
digging up the flowers, munching on the mums on the front porch,
and otherwise doing their darndest to find food.
</P>
<P>
   His new name came quickly to me, though naming cats still is no
more useful than naming rocks. This cat has a good ol' boy nature
to him, a stray probably dumped on the nearby highway, left to live
by his wits. Quick-witted, but no genius. That's Bubba Gump,
first-cousin to Forrest.
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe not. It's possible Bubba Gump wandered away from a
loving family in this neighborhood. Cats are bad about walking
away, carrying some unperceived-by-humans insult that causes them
to move on down the road. If that's the case, I will be happy to
return Bubba to its rightful owners. More than happy. I'm full up
on cats, my credo being to never have more cats than I do ex-wives.
</P>
<P>
   A description, for anyone missing a cat: orange tomcat with
white markings, probably a year or two old, very friendly, a bit
clumsy (he keeps running into chairs) but with a winning
personality. Call me. I live about halfway between Nacogdoches and
Lufkin just off Highway 59, if that helps, though cats have been
known to wander for miles.
</P>
<P>
   This cat has three options:
</P>
<P>
   -- Find its old owner, since Bubba obviously used to be
someone's pet. He has all those melt-your-heart cat tricks down pat
- the leg rubbing, rolling over on his back, making bread on your
pant leg, etc. Call me.
</P>
<P>
   -- Find a new owner. Giving away cats is about as easy as
finding someone who'll bet against the Yankees winning the American
League pennant this season. Cats are like opinions. Everybody has
one, and generally everybody has more than they need. Please call
me.
</P>
<P>
   -- Hang with us. I partially subscribe to my friend and fellow
writer Joe Murray's belief that you're obligated to care for all
the animals God sends you. I draw the line at big dogs, mean cats,
and birds of any feather. But
</P>
<P>
   most all the cats I've owned -- or rather who've owned me --
over the years have been strays. If it comes down to us keeping
Bubba, or taking him to the shelter, I'll keep him. Survival rate
at the shelter is not great, because there are too many unwanted
animals out there.
</P>
<P>
   Otto, my curmudgeon neutered-tomcat stray, is not a happy
camper. Neither is Kiki, the intellectually challenged step-cat
that came with the recent marriage. They have spent most of the
past week peering out the French door, making stupid cat noises as
Bubba Gump blithely polishes off another plate of Friskie Bits on
the back porch.
</P>
<P>
   Bubba is cool about being the intruder. He rolls over on his
back whenever the two senior occupants deign to step outside, never
picks a fight, ignores ``The Exorcist'' imitations Otto and Kiki
make, and tries to make nice. So far, no doing. Time will tell.
It's possible the two original cats will end up in therapy. Or
maybe I will.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is sure. Bubba will be an outside cat. Forever. Two
cats in the house is enough. Actually, it's too many. My wife, aka
the running buddy, is adamant about this, and I agree. Bubba will
be the watch-cat outside,
</P>
<P>
   protecting us against varmints and random crime.
</P>
<P>
   Or he could be yours for the price of a good home, a modest
amount of care, and a commitment to getting Bubba neutered and all
his shots.
</P>
<P>
   Call me. We even deliver.

   COMMENTARY: Lucky Bastard
</P>
<P>
   By Charles McCarry
</P>
<P>
   Random House, $24.95
</P>
<P>
   By JAY MILNER
</P>
<P>
   Contributing writer
</P>
<P>
   So, Bunky, you've grown weary of the Clinton/Monica soap opera,
eh? And you've decided whose fault it is and you're not gonna take
it anymore?
</P>
<P>
   Well, I'm pleased to be able to finally announce that a reliable
source has informed me who is at fault and why, and it's not who
you think. It's the Communists.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, the Communists. You probably thought they were all
but extinct, operating nowhere but in China and Cuba. Well, think
again, Bunky.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the straight poop from my source: Hillary is a ruthless,
revolutionary Commie from the word go. Bill is her dupe. Her secret
associates picked Bill way back when he was in high school because
he could lie like a pro even then. She was picked to be his
``handler'' because she could, with her extensive training as a
commie Swallow a a highly trained sexual acrobat and loyal
revolutionary and I don't know what all.
</P>
<P>
   I realize only a few people in high places will believe me on
this. Reps. Dan Burton and Bob Barr, for example, will no doubt go
for it whole hog and be on cable TV talk shows telling the world
about it as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   But it must be true because I just read all about it in Charles
McCarry's new book, ``Lucky Bastard,'' (Random House, $24.95 at
your friendly local book store.) And McCarry is every bit as
reliable a source as most other sources who have been quoted
anonymously so frequently in recent months. Maybe more
</P>
<P>
   so.
</P>
<P>
   McCarry's the one who wrote that wonderfully funny and accurate
take-off on Washington hi-jinks, ``Shelley's Heart'' a couple of
years back. One of my favorite books about our nation's political
shennigans. Not as important as ``Lucky Bastard,'' granted, but
worth your time, nevertheless. You can probably find copies in your
local library, if you're interested, and you probably will be after
reading ``Lucky Bastard,'' something I recommend unhesitatingly.
(If there is such a word as unhesitatingly. Anyway, you know
</P>
<P>
   what I mean.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, McCarry doesn't call his characters by their real names in
this book. Changes are made to protect the guilty as well as the
innocent, so to speak. But you will know them when you read about
them. There's John Fitzgerald Adams, who knows in his heart that he
is JFK's love child and has good reason to believe it.
</P>
<P>
   Jack, as he's affectionately called by his friends -- and he has
millions of them by the time he's old enough to run for President
of the USA, luckily becomes the beneficiary of a secret Russian
agency (so secret even the KGB doesn't know about it) and they
provide the funds and the strategy necessary for Jack to climb the
political ladder to the Oval Office from his poverty stricken
childhood.
</P>
<P>
   His lovely wife (the romance is promoted by the Russians) is a
vicious radical who is assigned the task of guiding Jack to the top
and controlling his libido, which is stronger than anyone's I've
ever heard of, even old
</P>
<P>
   whatshisname's. McCarry calls the first lady, as she eventually
becomes according to this reliable source, Morgan. But we know who
he's talking about, don't we?
</P>
<P>
   I won't go into more details here. It would ruin the story for
you. As all those talking heads on cable TV keep saying: We'll just
have to wait and find out the facts.
</P>
<P>
   Not from Kenneth Javert Starr's final report, but from Charles
McCarry's new book, ``Lucky Bastard.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY:ShortTakes
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometime during the glasnost era, as everyone dedicated himself
to the freshly arrived principles of democracy, some KGB delegates
in the Russian parliament got it all wrong by proposing to toss
anyone opposing free speech in the clink previously reserved for
poets. The poor fellows were just trying to humanize the KGB the
only way they knew.
</P>
<P>
   Our Internal Revenue Service has been in the penalty box for
these many months after congressional hearings portrayed the agency
as at least insensitive to the fiscal pain of others. The IRS swore
it would never do a lot of these things again, and would be warmer,
more open, consumer-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS kept its head down, presumably contemplating the
complexities of niceness. Until the other day, when Mark McGwire
prepared to hit his 62nd home run. Speculation rose that if a fan
caught the ball, and gave it to McGwire, the IRS would levy a gift
tax of 40 per cent of a presumed value of $1 million. It would be
just the luck of some bag lady to careen fragrantly into the
ballpark and catch the home run in her shopping cart while in a
generous mood. Contemplating this fantasy was more than most people
could bear.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the IRS actually threatened such mind-boggling
chintzyness - it now says it won't -- but that it was careful not
to deny it. For the IRS to even hint that it would not collect a
tax just sitting there was like asking the KGB to foreswear socking
a kulak in the snoot. Months of work out the window! The IRS is
reportedly putting out a book of CPA jokes to repair its damaged
image.

MORMONS POUND PAVEMENT AS OTHER CHURCHES FIND NEW WAYS TO SHARE
FAITH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LIZ STEVENS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HURST, Texas _ Bremen Drive on a late August afternoon is
silent. Everyone who can be indoors is.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone except Sarah White and Jessica Busath.
</P>
<P>
   At 2 p.m. on a Wednesday, Sister White and Sister Busath travel
this Hurst block on foot. They wear long black skirts, flats and
matching cream-colored blouses. Each clutches a small, navy Book of
Mormon.
</P>
<P>
   White, 22, and Busath, 21, take turns ringing doorbells, then
knocking if no one answers, which hardly anyone does. Of the 25
homes they approach on the street, they talk to four people who are
``very busy,'' ``very tired'' or ``don't need to be saved.''
</P>
<P>
   Busath and White remain undeterred _ and plenty hot. When the
Catholic woman who doesn't need saving invites them in anyway for a
glass of water, they eagerly accept and sing her a song of thanks.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, they're back outside, pounding the pavement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult,'' says White of the door-to-door ``field
teaching'' that is the responsibility of Mormon missionaries. ``But
it's something that you also gain great joy from, by touching
people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Evangelical Christian churches once shared that philosophy, too,
and through the late '70s and early '80s, door-to-door
proselytizing was a mainstay. But new attitudes and lifestyles have
changed that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Door-to-door solicitation is much less effective than it was
even in recent years,'' says Dr. Bryan Feille, a professor at Brite
Divinity School in Fort Worth. ``Part of that reason is perhaps
because of increased cynicism, perhaps over-saturation. I think it
really would turn off a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the new catch phrase among evangelists is ``relational
evangelism'' _ which entails catering to spiritual needs on a more
personal level.
</P>
<P>
   A church might offer a car-maintenance program to people in the
community, free haircuts for kids or free baby-sitting to single
moms, says Bruce Elwood, director of conferences at the
International Center for Leadership Development and Evangelism in
British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   It might mean bringing a friend to church, or visiting a
neighbor _ which is how Reach Arlington 2000 plans to take
Christian theology to every home in that city in the next several
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``For too long, the church has viewed evangelism as reaching
across some giant chasm, handing out a tract and being uninvolved
in people's lives,'' says Gary Hutchison, president of Arlington
Christian Ministries, which organizes Reach Arlington 2000 in the
Fort Worth suburb. ``We want to reach people genuinely.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting in December, members of Reach Arlington 2000 will visit
their 25 closest neighbors, delivering a video produced by Campus
Crusade for Christ. People can watch ``in their own home, in their
own time and choose whether they want to believe or not,''
Hutchison says.
</P>
<P>
   Evangelism can seem less ``unnatural'' when delivered by a
familiar person, says Brad Smith, executive director of the
Leadership Network in Dallas, a resource for churches seeking
growth. ``Some door-to-door is done very well, but it's rare. The
key is they're relaxed about it. It just doesn't have that same
attitude of past evangelism, which is a pretty hard sell.''
</P>
<P>
   There are people for whom even soft-sell evangelism is too much
evangelism _ like the Methodist woman who tells evangelicals at her
door she can't talk because she's getting ready for synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   Spike Tyson, president of the American Atheists in Austin, turns
the tables by handing out literature of his own. But even Tyson
believes citizens have a fundamental right to spread their messages
door-to-door, as long as no group forces its beliefs on anyone
else.
</P>
<P>
   Sisters White and Busath spent a month at the Missionary
Training Center in Provo, Utah, before the church assigned them to
Texas. Door-to-door training for Mormon missionaries involves
role-playing, which their instructors film and critique.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all missionaries, when they get to that very first
door, they're frozen in fear,'' White says. But she and Busath,
with 18 months of missionary work between them, interact calmly and
respectfully with the people they visit. By the end of the day, the
sisters have given away one Book of Mormon to a man who spoke
rudimentary English.
</P>
<P>
   The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints acknowledges
that knocking on doors is less effective than visiting people who
already have expressed an interest in Mormonism. ``We include
door-to-door in the mix'' because it's part of the church's
calling, says Don LeFevre, a spokesman at church headquarters in
Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   The Mormons ``must be doing something right,'' says Dr. Marshall
Fishwick, professor of American Studies at Virginia Tech
University. While most mainline Christian churches lose members,
the Mormon church adds 1 million converts worldwide every three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Jehovah's Witnesses use door-to-door to their advantage, too.
Membership in the United States surpassed 984,000 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one-on-one method of evangelism is the oldest and most
honored in the Christian tradition,'' Fishwick says. And so, in the
late 20th century, when mass media has become a powerful tool for
evangelicals, many churches are returning to the old-fashioned
``personal touch'' _ including ``relational'' methods and knocking
on strangers' doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesus set the pattern,'' says James Pellechia, a spokesman for
the Jehovah's Witnesses in Brooklyn, N.Y. ``He went right to the
people with the good news message and he taught them house to
house, in the villages and the public squares.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't improve on what the Lord did.''

 &HT;    CRIME IN THE BAHAMAS: PARADISE ISLAND'S IMAGE SUFFERS IN WAKE OF
MURDERS
 &HT;    With CRIME-DATA-$ADV12
 &HT;    By SHELLEY EMLING
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Paradise Island is an 826-acre tourist resort, an
unspoiled gem in the Bahamas where supermodel Cindy Crawford
honeymooned earlier this year following a tranquil, barefoot
ceremony on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   It's a place once inhabited by the Shah of Iran and press
magnate William Randolph Hearst that's still popular with the rich
and famous, attracting celebrities like Michael Jackson and Whitney
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   And it's also a place where signs assure visitors: ``It just
keeps getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   But one thing that's not getting better is the area's reputation
following the murders of three foreigners in recent weeks, and a
flurry of drug smuggling through the Bahamas to South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very upset about this because we depend so heavily on
tourism,'' said Valerie Thompson of the Bahamas Ministry of Tourism
in Nassau. ``We certainly don't want anything to happen that would
hurt our image.''
</P>
<P>
   But the image of the Bahamas, just 60 miles off Florida's coast,
has been tainted, although Bahamian officials insist that crime
against foreigners is extremely rare despite recent incidents.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 2, an Indonesian man, Johannes Hortanto, who was
working as a cabin steward on a Florida-based cruise ship, was
fatally shot during a robbery attempt along Bay Street, a major
shopping area in Nassau, across the bay from Paradise Island.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 22, police found the naked body of a second-grade
teacher from Virginia, Lori Fogleman, near Cabbage Beach on
Paradise Island, just hours after they discovered the body of
another young visitor, Joanne Clarke, a British teacher, just 40
yards away.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Aug. 30, a Scotland Yard detective sent to investigate
Clarke's murder was held up at gunpoint and robbed at Fort
Fincastle, a popular historic site for tourists, within 48 hours of
arriving in the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   No arrests have been made, but police have announced a search
for a possible serial killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing a very big investigation and we aren't ruling
anything out,'' said Douglas Hanna, a superintendent with the
Criminal Investigations Department in Nassau.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, drug officials have seized 7,460 kilograms of cocaine
in the Bahamas so far this year, compared to 2,557 kilograms of
cocaine in all of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seized more cocaine in the first three quarters of this
year than we did in the last three years combined,'' said Toni
Teresi, top agent for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in
Nassau.
</P>
<P>
   Plagued by increasingly greedy Mexican middlemen and stepped-up
law enforcement along the southwest U.S. border, Colombian drug
traffickers have shifted back to once-popular smuggling routes in
the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Not only the Bahamas, but the Dominican Republic, Haiti and
Aruba all have become major transit points for illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   As drug trafficking rises, so does drug-related crime, such as
robberies.
</P>
<P>
   All this hardly bodes well for the Bahamas, a coral archipelago
of some 700 low-lying islands that relies on tourism for 70 percent
of its revenue and more than half of all jobs in a country that
that struggles with unemployment estimated as high as 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The islands welcomed 3.4 million visitors last year, 80 percent
of them from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Since November, the U.S. State Department has warned visitors
that violent crime is on the rise in the Bahamas and that they
``should not travel alone on deserted areas of beaches and in
poorly lit areas at night.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government has not revised the warning in the wake of
the murders.
</P>
<P>
   Bahamian police say they are doing everything they can to make
visitors feel safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've added a lot of security personnel to areas where there
are tourists,'' Hanna said. ``You have to remember that crimes
against foreigners are very unusual here.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, seven foreigners have been murdered in the Bahamas,
which includes the recent killings, according to the Criminal
Investigation Department.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Carole Leach, 37, a British teacher, was found
beaten to death on the neighboring island of Eleuthera. Her murder
is still unsolved.
</P>
<P>
   Police say that it's still not clear why Clarke, 24, and
Fogleman, 32, were murdered. An autopsy showed signs of sexual
assault on Clarke's body, while Fogleman's credit cards were
stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Police are hoping to glean clues from Fogleman's rented 1997
silver Nissan Stanza, which was discovered earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Hubert Ingraham has announced a $200,000 reward
for information leading to an arrest and has solicited assistance
from the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a most difficult time for the Bahamas, a tourist
destination where we pride ourselves on extending warmth and
kindness,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Paradise Island, one of the region's most sophisticated resort
areas, is key to the development of the tourism industry in the
Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   By December, South African businessman Solomon Kerzner _ who
owns 80 percent of the real estate on Paradise Island _ hopes to
finish the expansion of a $750 million fantasy resort, Atlantis.
</P>
<P>
   If he's successful, Kerzner could eventually employ up to 4
percent of the country's labor force and account for 12 percent of
its gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly don't need anything to hurt our image,'' Thompson
said. ``We sure don't need anything else bad to occur here.''

MOYNIHAN SPONTANEOUS, UNSCRIPTED ON LEWINSKY COMMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.,
criticized President Clinton's conduct in the Monica Lewinsky sex
scandal, he was guided by a spontaneous desire to bolster Sen.
Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., according to Moynihan's friends and
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan believed he could not walk out of the Senate chamber
without offering his support to Lieberman, who had called Clinton's
behavior ``immoral'' and ``disgraceful.''
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan, his friends said, had not planned to speak on the
subject until Lieberman's remarks last week.
</P>
<P>
   For Moynihan, his Senate comments represented a gradual
escalation of his remarks in a radio interview on Albany, N.Y.
station WROM on Aug. 19 _ that Clinton's Aug. 17 admission of a
sexual relationship with Lewinsky was ``not adequate to its
purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Senate floor, he added: ``But it was not until just this
moment that the full measure of that inadequacy was presented to us
in the context of the needs of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in this way _ as a follower instead of a leader _ that
Moynihan stepped up to the plate and joined the rising chorus of
Democrats rebuking Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan ``simply wanted to go out there and thank Lieberman and
let him know he was not alone in his thinking,'' said Lawrence
O'Donnell, Senate Finance Committee chief of staff between 1993 and
1995 when Moynihan was chairman of the panel.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell said the senator's reaction was ``evidence of a
capacity of spontaneity, which in politics in this end of century
is a lost capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan's irrepressible need to say what's on his mind is a
sharp contrast to the mantra of modern politics to ``stay on
message,'' O'Donnell said, adding: ``When Pat Moynihan got into
politics, a `message' was something you got from Western Union.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday on ABC-TV's ``This Week with Sam Donaldson and Cokie
Roberts,'' Moynihan carried his point forward even further, urging
that the impeachment process be allowed to unfold normally, no
matter what the effect on Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ought to get on with it,'' he said, adding: ``You have to
be prepared for the worst, and to do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment is ``provided in the Constitution,'' he said. ``It's
a very straightforward provision.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an unscripted politician,'' said O'Donnell, now a
political analyst on MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Cunningham, Moynihan's 1994 re-election campaign manager
and now a senior vice president at Fleet Financial Group in Albany,
says the key to understanding Moynihan is to keep in mind that ``he
is by training an economist, so numbers and data mean something to
him.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``For Moynihan, if the data supports it, you go ahead.
It's not a matter of polling and crafting your position to fit some
political goal. We did polling during campaigns, but not between
them.''

HUGE MARCH FOR PEACE AND DEMOCRACY IN PHNOM PENH 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By SETH MYDANS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ In an extraordinary and largely
spontaneous outpouring that took this battered city by surprise,
thousands of people surged through the streets Thursday clapping,
cheering and chanting over and over, ``Hooray for peace!''
</P>
<P>
   Residents and shopkeepers packed sidewalks and balconies for
miles, some clapping, some weeping and some ripping off their
shirts and waving them above their heads.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two hours, no police officers or soldiers were
seen. The streets belonged to the people.
</P>
<P>
   More than any election result, this brief moment of hope and joy
amid the violence and hatred of the last few days seemed a clear
signal of the will of the people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was amazing,'' an analyst for the International Crisis
Group, Leo Dobbs, said. ``It was a show of people power that may
well send a message to government leaders that change is needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks after a disputed parliamentary election, this was a
march with no political leaders or political slogans, only people
who were shouting, ``We want peace!'' and, ``Democracy in
Cambodia!''
</P>
<P>
   The crowds seemed unanimous in their sentiment that the
strongman, Hun Sen, must go, despite his government's declaration
that he had won the election.
</P>
<P>
   What had started as a modest parade by students and monks
swelled to perhaps 10,000 people, including doctors, government
workers, out-of-uniform police officers and entire families
squeezed onto small motorbikes. Many waved green branches above
their heads as makeshift standards that symbolized peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody organized this demonstration,'' said Pen Chan, a
student who raised his voice above the rhythmic clapping. ``This
demonstration came from our heart. We want democracy. And I can
tell you directly we do not want this government any more. I would
like to tell you that people have suffered for a long time already.
Now we cannot keep it inside our heart any more.''
</P>
<P>
   As evening approached, the men who rule Cambodia staged a
reminder that they were still in charge. In a show of force
truckloads of police officers, a line of red fire trucks and a
roaring convoy of black-clad motorcycle officers with automatic
weapons barreled through the streets, scattering the marchers.
</P>
<P>
   Here and there, the officers stopped, jumped from their trucks,
beat a few people and sped away.
</P>
<P>
   As evening fell most of the security forces had disappeared.
Several hundred people remained in the dark on the steps of the
Independence Monument, a central landmark, dancing, clapping and
chanting. Vans of officers drove by occasionally, lights flashing,
and people cheered.
</P>
<P>
   But there was still menace in the air. Shots could be heard here
and there in the night, and the crowds were filled with rumors of
killings.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The day had started violently, like the last two days. Police
attacked demonstrators near the U.S. Embassy, clubbing them and
firing weapons. An 18-year-old was shot in the neck and critically
wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights workers said Thursday that they had found the
bodies of two young men, who appeared to have been killed
Wednesday, in shallow graves on the outskirts of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the day the violence began, one man was killed. Human
rights workers say one monk was killed Wednesday. But reporters
have not been able to confirm that.
</P>
<P>
   Without explanation, security forces have been beating and
arresting monks in a crackdown that has enraged the public. In the
crowds people talked of the attacks on monks. In a statement
Monday, King Norodom Sihanouk especially deplored the first of the
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the mass killings by the Communist Khmer Rouge from
1975 to 1979, these are the first attacks on members of the
Buddhist clergy since 1942, when the French colonial administration
was faced with protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the shooting of monks is something that has shocked
people,'' a diplomat with long experience here said. ``This is a
turning point.''
</P>
<P>
   The turmoil grows out of the election, on July 26, in which Hun
Sen's party won a majority of parliamentary seats. His two rivals,
Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, say the irregularities marred the
voting and counting and are demanding a review of the results.
</P>
<P>
   Monday two hand grenades exploded at Hun Sen's home, and he said
that opposition leaders would be arrested, although there have been
no arrests so far.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday soldiers tore down a tent city where supporters of the
opposition candidates had camped out for two weeks. The tensions
and violence have grown since then.
</P>
<P>
   But the demonstration Thursday afternoon seemed to be a moment
without fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so proud to see so many people on the streets,'' a
marcher, Dr. Eam Bophal, said. ``People need democracy. That is why
they are clapping their hands. They feel they have some power. They
have felt so helpless, you know.''

ART NOTES: A KEY VAN GOGH AUCTION; NEW CHIEF AT HAMMER MUSEUM 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By CAROL VOGEL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Code Words for a Noted Sale
</P>
<P>
   An 1889 self-portrait that van Gogh made as a 70th-birthday
present for his mother, Anna Cornelia Carbent van Gogh, and that
experts believe is the last self-portrait he painted before his
death in 1890 will be sold at Christie's in New York on Nov. 19. It
is estimated to bring $20 million to $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   The van Gogh is part of a collection that will be identified
only as ``important paintings and sculpture from a European
estate,'' a phrase knowledgeable auctiongoers have seen before at
Christie's. They will rightly assume means that the works are from
the collection of Jacques Koerfer, the German-born collector and
former chairman of BMW, who died in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than dispose of his extraordinary collection of
predominantly 20th-century art in one big sale, his heirs have been
parceling out groups of works for four years for sale at Christie's
in New York. Each time, the works have been labeled ``important
paintings and sculpture from a European estate.''
</P>
<P>
   The three sales so far have featured paintings by Picasso,
Mondrian, Gauguin and Leger and have totaled $60.1 million. The
last of the collection will be sold at the Nov. 19 sale, as part of
Christie's auction of 20th-century art.
</P>
<P>
   Nine other works from the collection are being offered with the
van Gogh, bringing the total Koerfer sales estimate to $35 million
to $40 million. And some experts think Koerfer's heirs have saved
the best for last.
</P>
<P>
   The van Gogh, which shows the artist with heavily chiseled
features and an intense stare, is historically important. ``Van
Gogh was in St. Remy at the time he painted this,'' said Franck
Giraud, who runs Christie's 19th- and 20th-century art departments
in New York. ``He was sick and wanted to reassure his mother he was
all right, so he painted his self-portrait after having shaved off
his beard to make himself look younger.''
</P>
<P>
   The last van Gogh self-portrait offered at auction, an 1888
self-portrait from the estate of Robert Lehman, brought $26.4
million at Christie's in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Buying from well-known worldwide dealers, Koerfer formed the
bulk of his collection during the 1950s and 1960s. He hung the
works in his house on Lake Maggiore in Switzerland, which was
designed by Marcel Breuer and completed in 1966. Like many
well-to-do European collectors, Koerfer was quiet about his art
purchases and only rarely lent works to museums.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the van Gogh, Christie's will also sell a late Cezanne
landscape, ``Le Chateau Noir,'' from 1904, which once was in the
collection of Lord Kenneth Clark, a former director of the National
Gallery in London. A mosaic of green and blue brushwork, it is one
of 24 works Cezanne painted at the Chateau Noir, a neo-Gothic
chateau on the outskirts of Aix-en-Provence.
</P>
<P>
   The chateau was built by a rich coal merchant in the 19th
century and was so loved by Cezanne that he rented a room there to
store his painting supplies. The landscape is one of only six
Cezannes that show the chateau. Christie's expects it to sell for
$6 million to $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Other works being sold from the Koerfer collection include
Leger's ``Typographie,'' a 1918 brightly colored painting with
angular planes and rounded forms that allude to parts of the human
body and to machines. The work, which was included in the Museum of
Modern Art's retrospective of the artist last year, has an estimate
of $5 million to $7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Another painting, also once shown at the Modern, is Mondrian's
1931 ``Composition With Red, Black and White,'' a classic by the
artist with a small red section in its lower left corner. It is
estimated to bring $2 million to $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   A Shift at the Hammer
</P>
<P>
   Anne Philbin, executive director of the Drawing Center in New
York's Soho for nine years, has been named director of UCLA at the
Armand Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural Center in Los Angeles. She
replaces Henry Hopkins, who will step down at the end of the year
and resume teaching in the university's department of art.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Philbin is credited with taking an already respected
institution and giving it an even better and livelier image. She
organized a number of historical exhibitions at the Drawing Center,
including the recent show of Victor Hugo's drawings and the 1992
``Guercino: Drawings From Windsor Castle'' as well as many
exhibitions by contemporary artists. She begins her new job in
January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw this as an opportunity to be involved in building and
shaping a young institution,'' Ms. Philbin said. ``Los Angeles is
such a fantastically vital city for the arts right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hammer Museum, in the Westwood section of Los Angeles,
opened in 1990 in a $60 million building paid for by Dr. Armand
Hammer, the chairman of the Occidental Petroleum Corp. until his
death in 1990. Occidental provided the museum with a $35 million
endowment.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 UCLA assumed management of the museum, merging several
art collections: the museum's collection of Old Master, 19th- and
20th-century works formed by Hammer; art owned by the university,
including a Matisse collage, and 35,000 works on paper from the
Grunwald Center for the Graphic Arts, part of the Hammer Museum.
The museum's staff also oversees the Franklin D. Murphy Sculpture
Garden.

OTTOMAN CALLIGRAPHY: THE POWER OF THE WORD IN DARTING FLAMES OF
GOLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Exhibition notes are at the end of review.)

   NEW YORK _ Words are everywhere in Islamic art. Verses from the
the Koran wind around the domes of mosques and fill the pages of
books. Blessings are carved on tombstones and inscribed on lamps
and bowls; charms are stitched into fabrics and written in henna on
the palms of hands
</P>
<P>
   The ubiquity of written language had practical roots. The Koran
is believed to have been dictated by God to the prophet Mohammed;
only through vigilant recopying could revelation be preserved. And
in a geographically far-flung culture, which stretched from China
to Spain, that holy text was a crucial source of group identity.
</P>
<P>
   For these reasons calligraphy has always held a high esthetic
status in the Islamic world. But it is a difficult art to export.
Language, in this case the Arabic script, now becomes a problem:
you either understand it or you don't, and if you don't, the visual
forms it takes, however expressive, are hard to fully respond to or
appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   This being so, ``Letters in Gold: Ottoman Calligraphy from the
Sakip Sabanci Collection, Istanbul,'' which opens Friday at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, may sound like an event that ranks low
on a new-season priority list. But don't be fooled: even a casual
visit to this exhibition is bound to produce something like a
conversion experience.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering of 70 illuminated books, scrolls and wall plaques
is drawn from the premier private collection of such material in
Turkey, where the Ottoman dynasty ruled for six centuries, until
1923. And on every level, and in the very best sense, the show is a
triumph of superb packaging.
</P>
<P>
   The Met, for its part, has produced a memorably theatrical
setting for the work, with atmospheric lighting and suggestive
architectural touches. But the objects themselves, each a vehicle
for the written word, are the persuaders. Whether the texts are
Koranic verses or imperial edicts, they are treated by Ottoman
artists as pearls beyond price: written in exquisite script on
burnished paper, framed in painted borders of lapis lazuli and
gold, and bound in hand-tooled leather covers.
</P>
<P>
   One could take the results purely as visual spectacle and leave
it at that. But the chronologically arranged exhibition, organized
by Stefano Carboni, associate curator of Islamic art at the Met,
has a fascinating story to tell as it traces the history of Turkish
calligraphy, one of the great traditions of Islamic art.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tradition passed down through an unbroken line of
practitioners from the 15th century to the present day, and many of
its stellar names are included here. The earliest of them is the
near-mythical Seyh Hamdullah (1429-1520), who mastered the six
standard Arabic cursive scripts, then added innovations of his own.
</P>
<P>
   He is represented at the Met by two Koranic manuscripts, one of
them an accordion-style album decorated with the kind of marbled
paper that became an Ottoman specialty. Both books show the
distinctive style that later writers both emulated and rebelled
against: tensile, alert, marked by a kind of astringent elegance,
with characters leaning ever so slightly to the left as they move
across the page through a blizzard of diacritical dots and dashes.
</P>
<P>
   One of the master's most distinguished heirs was Hafiz Osman
(1642-1698), who is a central figure in the show, both a link to
the past and to the present. Born into a poor family in Istanbul,
he began religious training early. (``Hafiz'' is the title given to
someone who has committed the Koran to memory). He made an
intensive study of Seyh Hamdullah's work, then radically departed
from it, infusing the Ottoman style with a sense of pulse and
spontaneity that had far-reaching consequences.
</P>
<P>
   His influence is evident more than a century after his death in
the generous style of Mustafa Rakim (1758-1826), who excelled in
the large-scale inscriptions called levhalar. And a collaboration
in this format between Rakim and his prize pupil, the Ottoman
emperor Mahmud II, movingly illustrates the teacher-student bond on
which the calligraphic tradition rested.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The main inscription, stenciled in gold on a royal-blue ground
and closely modeled on Rakim's style, was designed by Mahmud II and
reads, ``I cannot have success but with the help of God.'' At the
very end of the phrase, another, smaller inscription appears: it is
the emperor's name, but written by his teacher in a sinuous tangle
of script shaped like a bud or a leaping flame.
</P>
<P>
   The 19th century, from which this work dates, is one of the
grand moments of Ottoman calligraphy, and a time when decorative
illumination of books and plaques could be almost overpoweringly
lavish. A Koran copied in 1862 by Mehmed Sevki Efendi is so
extensively gilded that its pages give off an eerie metallic sheen.
And interlaced patterns on a series of levhalar from the end of the
century suggest how Westernized Turkey had become by that point:
their designs look like pure Art Nouveau.
</P>
<P>
   But for classic examples of calligraphy's potential for refined
decorative exuberance, one must return to the great imperial
emblems of an earlier time, known as tugras. A distinctive Ottoman
creation, they were designed to appear as signatures on edicts or
property grants, of which several 16th- and 17th-century examples
are on view in the show.
</P>
<P>
   The documents themselves, in the form of long, narrow vertical
scrolls, are splendid things. At the top of each appear the names
of the reigning emperor and his father, woven together into a
looping, tassled confection of gold and blue that swoops and preens
like an exotic bird.
</P>
<P>
   The Met has given the scrolls, along with everything else in the
exhibition, a magnetic setting, designed by Michael Batista. The
tugras float like jewels against midnight-blue walls; the lustrous
19th-century books sit like sacred objects in a dreamy evocation of
a mosque interior.
</P>
<P>
   Too much emphasis on material charisma over content? Not in this
case. Most visitors to ``Letters in Gold'' will have little
knowledge of what the letters themselves actually mean. But they
will see in a flash the kind of power the written word still
carries in Islamic culture, where God is regarded as the divine
calligrapher and man the pen in his hand.

 By JAMES R. OESTREICH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In one sense, it was a hard show to steal. Millennial
Arts Productions' staging of ``Esther'' in May combined a Handel
oratorio with a Racine play, using separate but interacting young
casts of singers, actors and dancers. The dancers included Handel
and Racine, as characters. Though admirable in its ambition, the
production had a touch of the circus.
</P>
<P>
   In another sense, Bejun Mehta, who was making his first
appearance as countertenor, playing Mordecai in the singing cast,
faced little competition. Musically, and perhaps dramatically as
well, he was in an altogether more exalted league than almost
anyone else involved. And he had come out of nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Just about. For one listener, the name in the ``Esther''
program, memorable on several counts, caused a start. Despite his
youth, Mehta, who has since turned 30 and is to make his New York
City Opera debut Friday evening as Armindo in Handel's
``Partenope,'' came with a past. In 1982, at 14, he made a solo
recording as a soprano for Delos, which, though acclaimed in some
quarters, landed unopened on this critic's groaning shelf of
oddities.
</P>
<P>
   Retrieved there recently, the record proved astounding not only
for the solidity and beauty of the voice itself but also for the
musicality and expressivity with which the young man wielded it.
Still, in one of the many insidious tricks nature plays on
struggling young males, success as a boy soprano does not
necessarily bode well, or anything at all, for an adult career as a
singer. In all likelihood, for Mehta one thing did not lead
directly to another.
</P>
<P>
   Far from it, as the remarkable tale turns out. Mehta _ who is a
cousin of Zubin Mehta, the former music director of the New York
Philharmonic, and Zarin Mehta, the executive director of the
Ravinia Festival near Chicago _ had already enjoyed a big career
within the realm available to a boy soprano. The field, though
limited, was growing at the time with the early-music movement's
historically based fondness for male voices, from top to bottom.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's precocious artistry caught the attention of Leonard
Bernstein and other notables. In 1983, he sang in recital in New
York with Carol Rosenberger, a pianist heard on the record, who
introduced his appearance as ``a debut and farewell.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, as boy sopranos are wont to do, he dropped out of sight
with a change of voice. Plans to perform Mahler's Fourth Symphony
with Bernstein were dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was sort of a double whammy,'' the affable Mehta said over
coffee on Tuesday at one of his favorite haunts, a bustling bakery
near his apartment on the Upper West Side. ``Not only did you stop
being visible and famous but you lost what it was that you could
do. And that was tremendously painful.''
</P>
<P>
   Some young performers, like Joshua Bell, the superb 30-year-old
violinist, have neatly sidestepped the risks entailed with early
and prodigious gifts, and moved smoothly into mature careers. But
for a boy soprano, there is no dodging the biological imperative. A
disruption of some sort is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   In Mehta's case, it was drastic, even though he seemed well
prepared. He was born to a musical family, in 1968, in Ann Arbor,
Mich., and his talents pointed in many directions. His father, Dady
Mehta, who was born in India, is a pianist who teaches at Eastern
Michigan University. His mother, Martha Ritchey Mehta, taught voice
and was the only singing teacher of his youth. His older brother,
Nuvi, his only sibling, plays violin and conducts in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Bejun Mehta sang, all the time, as far back as he can remember.
At 8, he took up cello, with hardly less success, and he eventually
added conducting. He actually quit singing soprano about a year
before he had to and threw himself into the cello. That instrument
soon led him to New Haven, Conn., to study with the venerable Aldo
Parisot, and eventually to Yale University, where he studied
Germanic literature and wrote a thesis on Heine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I missed words,'' Mehta said of the cello. ``And the repertory
didn't really hold my interest. Every time I played the cello, the
things I played well were vocal things. I was always trying to make
it into this vocal thing, and I missed the immediacy of having it
come out of my body.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehta describes this transitional period vividly and hauntingly
in an epilogue he has written for a book by Claude Kenneson,
``Musical Prodigies: Perilous Journeys, Remarkable Lives,'' to be
published next year by Amadeus Press: ``I thrashed about, looking
for ways to fill in the space where my voice had been. I use the
word `space' advisedly, in both its figurative and literal
meanings. I remember feeling an almost palpable hole in my chest .
. . as though all the activity in my solar plexus had been
frozen.''
</P>
<P>
   His childhood, he explains, was one of great joy _ sheer joy in
singing _ and loneliness. A deep-seated sense of isolation stemmed
from the fact that people tended to respond to his voice as an
object in itself rather than to the core of his being. And yet the
voice was the very thing that allowed him on occasion to express
that core, to make contact with what he calls his Muse world.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was really going on,'' he writes, ``was that my voice had
quietly become my sole sense of identification, so that the nearly
incapacitating fear I had felt during the voice-loss stemmed not so
much from worries about making myself understood in the Muse world
again, but from the subconscious feeling that I was teetering on
the edge of an existential abyss. That I had successfully
transferred to the cello did nothing to alleviate this fear,
because the issue at hand was not one of simply establishing a new
musical outlet but of maintaining basic self-identification. Who
would I be when my voice was gone? How could I be special without
it? What would be left?''
</P>
<P>
   Only in recent months and years has he come to such an
understanding of the issues of the transition, he says, and the
writing of the epilogue itself helped him work through those still
unresolved. What he went through, he now recognizes, was nothing
less than a process of grief.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a death,'' he said, ``a death of something that was very
important to you, more important than you knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehta eventually started to sing again, as a baritone. He
studied with excellent teachers, Phyllis Curtin and Edward Zambara,
all to little avail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never felt natural,'' he said. ``I knew I was a good
musician, and I knew I had all this stuff, and I also knew that the
baritone wasn't allowing me to get to it. It's like always walking
by Barney's and looking in the windows and not having the money to
buy any of the clothes inside. It just wasn't good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne, who has known Mehta for several
years and been his strongest and most influential supporter in his
brief career as a countertenor, saw the problem, too. ``He tried
very hard to be a baritone, and it was nondescript,'' Ms. Horne
said this week. ``It would never have gone anywhere. And yet he
needed to be a singer again.''
</P>
<P>
   He performed around New York. In the meantime, he had been
piecing together a freelance living, largely by producing records.
A recording of the Bach cello suites by Janos Starker that Mehta
produced for RCA won a Grammy award this year. He also produced
reissues for Sony Classical in its acclaimed Masterworks Heritage
series.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last November, having actually given up singing earlier in
the year, he read a profile of the countertenor David Daniels in
The New Yorker and was thunderstruck. ``It was just my life coming
off the page,'' he said. Struck by similarities in their
experience, Mehta stood up from his chair, he said, and tried
singing countertenor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was after six months of having made no sound. So my vocal
cords and the whole vocal apparatus were sort of at rest, sort of
in limbo, and it worked. And the thing that was encouraging was
that I liked the quality. And this was going into my producer ears
now. I wasn't making allowances for my own voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehta described his discovery with such ebullience that it
seemed he might burst into song by way of demonstration at any
moment. He confined himself to pounding his fists on the table in
delight.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of such a venture had simply never occurred to him, he
said. ``I have basically disliked countertenor singing my whole
life. That hooty, broken-voice sound was the last thing I wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   He recounted an incident backstage in Vienna, when, amid a large
group speaking in German, Bernstein asked whether the lad might go
on to be a countertenor. Mehta responded, ``Aber nein,'' he said, a
phrase that with the emphasis and inflection he gave it,
translates, ``No way!''
</P>
<P>
   But his timing was excellent, even apart from the fact that the
classical-record business was retrenching, decimating his income in
the process. The nature of countertenor singing has changed in
recent years, largely through Daniels' doing. The new breed, which
also includes David Walker, who won the Metropolitan Opera National
Council auditions last year and sings Arsace in the City Opera's
``Partenope'' Friday evening, sings with greater body, tonal allure
and evenness throughout the range than some of those ghostly
sounding figures of yore.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a kind of countertenor singing, over the last
five years or so, that I found a worthy model,'' he said. Now, he
thought, why not give it a try?
</P>
<P>
   This time he has taught himself. The only element that wasn't in
place from the outset, he said, was the low passaggio break,
essentially the passage from high-baritone chest sound into the
falsetto region. ``I said to myself that if I couldn't smooth that
through such that either there was no discontinuity or you couldn't
hear it,'' he said, ``I wouldn't sing as a countertenor.''
</P>
<P>
   He evidently feels he succeeded, and so did many who heard him
in May. What was especially notable then for a countertenor was the
warmth of his tone. In his own description, his tone has a low spin
in contrast to the high spin of Daniels and Walker.
</P>
<P>
   After that performance, Mehta joined Ms. Horne this summer at
the Music Academy of the West in Santa Barbara, Calif. ``He took
the place by storm,'' said Ms. Horne, whose foundation is to
present him in recital next year. ``He just keeps getting better
and better.''
</P>
<P>
   For the rest, Mehta has not yet had time to map out a new
career. He doesn't intend to stick to the standard countertenor
repertory, he said, casting a sparkling eye, for example, toward
the alto parts in Mahler's Second and Third Symphonies.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is simply reveling in a newfound voice. To hear, and for
that matter see, him talk is to know that he would rather be
singing. &QL;

   MARKET (New York) _ The drop in stock prices accelerated
Thursday amid increasing worries about the Clinton presidency and
more evidence that foreign economic distress is seriously eroding
company profits. The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 249.48

the afternoon when the blue-chip gauge neared the 20 percent
cumulative loss often used to designate a bear market. By Robert D.

   GAME OF THE WEEK:
</P>
<P>
   Monday night at 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco (1-0) vs. Washington (0-1)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: 49ers _ (58-22) Road record in '90s; Redskins _ (8)
Sacks allowed vs. Giants.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: The nation's capital glistens once again as these
familiar franchises meet in a game that could completely color the
Redskins' season. We are quite familiar with the 49ers: Super
Bowls, Steve Young, Jerry Rice, big plays, big stars. We are not so
familiar with this brand of Redskins: Glory lost, lackluster
quarterback play, punctured defense and an awful debut loss last
weekend at the Giants. Trent Green replaces Gus Frerotte at
quarterback. No doubt, there will be other changes, ranging in
subtle to major, as this game unfolds for Washington. It is huge
for them. The Redskins play at Seattle next and then hosts Denver
and Dallas. After Philadelphia they play at Minnesota and then the
Giants again. A torrid stretch. If Washington isn't careful, it
could easily be 1-7 at midseason. For now, it will be only 0-2. But
for a team with such proud tradition and high hopes, even that is a
mouthful. 49ers, 28-16.
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY 1 P.M. GAMES:
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore (0-1) vs. Jets (0-1)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Ravens (7.33) _ Average gain on 1st down; Jets (58) _
Foley passes in debut.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: It was the flavor of the game, right? It was 22 carries
and only 58 yards (a 2.6 average yards gained per carry) for Curtis
Martin that forced it that way, right? What other explanation is
there for Glen Foley throwing 58 passes vs. the 49ers! Well, he
completed 30 for 415 passing yards. Nice numbers. But the Jets
lost. And another week of lackluster running will cost them again.
Ravens, 17-16.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo (0-1) vs. Miami (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Bills (7.5) _ Bruce Smith career sacks vs. Marino.
Dolphins (7 of 8) _ Won at home vs. AFC East.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: Buffalo used to love to play Miami. The rivalry was
special and remains unique. Too bad the Bills don't. They could now
win in San Diego and have little chance of winning in Miami. They
are 15-12 vs. Dan Marino, the only AFC East team with a winning
record against him. Andre Reed has three 100-yard receiving games
in his last five vs. Miami. But the Dolphins are 24-4 in home
openers since 1970 and have more of everything than Buffalo on
offense, defense and special teams. Dolphins, 27-9.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City (1-0) vs. Jacksonville (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Chiefs (6) _ Derrick Thomas sacks; Jaguars (13) _
Streak without allowing 100 yd. rusher.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: If the Kansas City offense clicks, then this game will
be a joy. It could be a preview of the AFC championship game. Both
have stellar defenses, offenses, special teams, coaches and stars.
Both play physical, hard football. Jacksonville is a touch faster.
But the Kansas City defense is already in sync. Chiefs, 16-13.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego (1-0) vs. Tennessee (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Chargers (3) _ sacks by Rodney Harrison; Oilers (1991)
_ Last year Oilers were 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: Rodney Harrison is a safety. He is supposed to defend
passes. He does. But he also blitzes the quarterback and gets
there. At least, he did against Buffalo last week, gaining three
sacks. A safety with three sacks? Steve McNair and the Oilers won't
be so easy to track. McNair lives throwing on the run. He will take
this shootout with rookie sensation Ryan Leaf personally. Watch the
fireworks. Oilers, 37-20.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina (0-1) vs. New Orleans (1-0) _
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Panthers (19.8) _ Rocket Ismail's average. Yards per
catch. Saints (50) _ Consecutive games with a sack.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: The Panthers felt so horrible losing at home to
Atlanta. If the Saints had Billy Joe Hobert still at quarterback,
the Panthers would have felt more miserable losing to the Saints.
Hobert is lost for the season due to injury and that kills the
Saints' chances. Panthers, 20-10.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota (1-0) vs. St. Louis (0-1)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Vikings (5.0) _ Robert Smith's average yards per
carry; Rams (232.0) _ Average yards allowed per game.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: The Rams actually outgained New Orleans in yardage by
323 to 234 but lost last week. Oh, the little things. They continue
to plague the Rams, who are 18-31 since moving to St. Louis and are
still having a mess of a time turning the corner. What's the deal?
Ask Minnesota. They have been an average to just above average
bunch for a while and now they are poised for something special.
They have grown. There is something special in the air with these
Vikings. It continues. Vikings, 21-17.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia (0-1) vs. Atlanta (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Eagles (29.1) _ Bobby Hoying's quarterback rating;
Falcons (1,646) _ Morten Andersen's career points.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: Kicker Morten Andersen ranks second in scoring among
active players. He still has a booming leg and gives the Falcons an
added dimension. Coach Dan Reeves is changing attitudes in the
Falcons' locker room. These guys are learning how to win,
especially in close games. This one won't be so close. Just another
positive step for the Falcons. Falcons, 17-14.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay (0-1) vs. Green Bay (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: _ Buccaneers (0-5) _ Dungy's record vs. Packers;
Packers (11-2) Holmgren's record vs. Bucs.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: Green Bay has gotten the better of this series. And it
has won 24 consecutive home games. The league record is 28. Brett
Favre has 24 touchdown passes and only 6 interceptions vs. the
Bucs. He's a big part of the difference. Somewhere, this string for
Tampa Bay must end. Not here. Packers, 23-10.

   KEY STAT: _ Bears (6-4-1) _ Record at Pittsburgh; Steelers
(157.9) _ Stewart's 4th quarter qb rating.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: Kordell Stewart threw for 173 yards vs. Baltimore last
week. He completed 14 of 27 passes. But in the 4th quarter, he
completed 4 of 5 passes for 62 yards including the game-winning
20-yard touchdown strike to Charles Johnson. The Steelers are built
for 4th quarter stamina all the way around. The Bears are not.
Steelers, 26-6.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati (0-1) vs. Detroit (0-1)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: _ Bengals (0) _ Sacks and interceptions; Lions (67.2)
_ Scott Mitchell's QB rating.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: The Bengals are going nowhere if they can't force more
action on defense. The offense has potential and it could be a
special day for receiver Carl Pickens; he has 52 career TD catches
and needs 2 more to pass Isaac Curtis as the Bengals' all-time
leader. Scott Mitchell (23 completions, 21 incompletions) looked
lousy at times, as did his teammates, at Green Bay last week.
Mitchell and Barry Sanders and the Lions break loose. Lions, 33-16.
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY 4 P.M. GAMES:
</P>
<P>
   Arizona (0-1) vs. Seattle (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: _ Cardinals (1-3) _ Record vs. Warren Moon; Seahawks
(406.0) _ Offensive yds. per game.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: Seahawk rookie Ahman Green is averaging 16.7 yards per
carry. That's right, per rush (6 attempts, 100 yards, 1 TD).
Seahawks receiver Joey Galloway is averaging 23.7 yards per catch.
That's right, per catch (6 receptions, 142 yards, 2 touchdowns).
Seattle, under the direction of quarterback Warren Moon, can roll
it up on anyone. And the defense (Shawn Springs, Chad Brown) bites,
too. Seahawks, 30-13.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas (1-0) vs. Denver (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: _ Cowboys (11-4) _ vs. AFC on road in `90s. Broncos (7
of 9) _ Won vs. NFC.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: Denver has won 17 consecutive regular season home
games. It has Terrell Davis and John Elway back packing that 1-2,
run-pass, Super Bowl punch. It has won 21 straight when leading
after three quarters. It has it all. Or so it seems. Dallas wants
some of that luster back. Watch Emmitt Smith outrun Davis. That
turns the game. Cowboys, 24-21.
</P>
<P>
   Giants (1-0) vs. Oakland (0-1)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Giants _ (3) Players with 2 or more sacks. Raiders
(-5) _ Turnover differential.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: The Giants defense has held 7 of its last 9 opponents
to 20 or fewer points. The Giants win with defense but tackle an
upscale passing attack vs. the Raiders. The Giants answer is the
blitz. Can the Raiders hit enough bombs to make them pay? Almost.
Giants, 20-19.
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY NIGHT GAME:
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis (0-1) vs. New England (0-1)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Colts (2.3) _ Faulks average yards per rush; Patriots
(51.0) _ Tom Tupa's punting average.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: There goes Peyton Manning in his road debut and it
could get ugly. The Patriots seek to right their ship after sinking
in Denver and Manning is the target. The will blitz him, attempt to
confuse him with a variety of disguised coverages. All around, the
Patriots will attack. Patriots, 30-13.

HALLMARK BUYS SMALL COMPETITOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Hallmark Cards Inc. said Wednesday that it
was buying InterArt Holding Corp., a small greeting-card competitor
whose product line includes items designed by artist Mary
Engelbreit.
</P>
<P>
   The deal marks Hallmark's largest domestic acquisition in the
personal expression business. In July, Hallmark spent $310 million
to buy Creative Publishing plc in the United Kingdom, giving it the
largest share of the greeting card industry there. The acquisition
price for InterArt wasn't disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   InterArt has 620 employees and is based in Bloomington, Ind. For
fiscal 1998, which ended March 31, the company posted $53 million
in sales of greeting cards, writing paper, gift packaging, frames,
magnets, posters, journals and albums. Three-fourths of InterArt's
1998 sales came from greeting cards.
</P>
<P>
   Hallmark spokesman Steve Doyal said InterArt was a good fit with
Kansas City-based Hallmark. ``Although the sizes of the two are
very different, the basic values and structure are the same,''
Doyal said.
</P>
<P>
   Doyal said Hallmark was attracted to InterArt partly because
there is virtually no overlap in product distribution. InterArt's
products are sold in more than 22,000 stores such as gift shops,
florists and bookstores, including Barnes &AMP; Noble.

`OVERQUALIFIED' OFTEN HAS HIDDEN MEANING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: One of the stupidest phrases in the world of work is
``you're overqualified for the job.''
</P>
<P>
   What do they want? Someone's who's underqualified?
</P>
<P>
   The most frustrated job-hunters I hear from are those with fine
resumes, skills and potential who have been turned down for jobs
they truly need, if not want.
</P>
<P>
   An experienced receptionist was dumbfounded when she received a
terse letter from a company where she thought her job interview had
gone really well. The letter said the position went to someone who
``more closely matched'' their needs.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, a college graduate with two decades of experience in
similar receptionist jobs, later learned a high school graduate
with limited and varied work experience won the job.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need to be cynical to wonder two things: Was age
discrimination a factor? Or was the company primarily interested in
getting someone for the least possible amount of money?
</P>
<P>
   I recently followed an Internet discussion among human resource
professionals on this topic. The consensus was that employers
should reconsider before ever using the ``overqualified'' excuse.
</P>
<P>
   It's too easy for a spurned applicant who falls in a protected
class (age or race, for example) to claim discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would question how you would defend yourself in court or
before (an) EEOC hearing,'' one discussion participant wrote.
``Could you say, `I didn't hire him//her because it is our company
policy to hire only the mediocre'... or `We make it a point to
never hire the best qualified.'''
</P>
<P>
   Employers counter that some candidates are overqualified, that
they would be bored stiff and soon leave the job, thus costing the
organization a lot of money and lost productivity because of
employee turnover.
</P>
<P>
   One human resource professional said the interview was a good
time to weed out ``overqualified '' candidates who have no
intention of staying in the job for long. Interviewers might ask,
``How long do you expect to hold this job before getting a
promotion (or before earning raises to bring your pay back up to
what you're accustomed)?''
</P>
<P>
   Who knows if a true answer will follow, but it might.
</P>
<P>
   I thought Michael Lary's comments, which came from Edmonds,
Wash., were on target. Lary gave permission to quote from his
message. He said, in part:
</P>
<P>
   ``I have watched companies reject excellent potential employees
on the belief that they want someone whom `they can train, doesn't
bring old work habits or skills to the job, will stay there forever
(my aside: on what planet?!), will be satisfied with the pay (my
aside: in what solar system?!)' Unfortunately, it has serious
implications for our society and economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``...I have seen enough waste of good, valuable talent to know
it cannot be reasonable to decide that well-qualified candidates
should be rejected for any reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Lary suggested that the best way to weed out ``overqualified''
candidates was to tell them what the salary is and ask them if they
still want to be considered for the job.
</P>
<P>
   If money is the only motivator, the ``overqualified'' applicant
will find someplace else to make more money. But if the job itself
is what's important, the ``overqualified'' applicant will continue
to go for it _ and probably give extra effort in gratitude.

PANEL STUDIES CHARGES BEYOND IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The word ``impeachment'' echoed throughout a
Capitol Hill hearing room nearly two hours Wednesday morning _ long
before independent counsel Kenneth Starr's report arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion was a hearing _ part academic exercise and part
campaign event _ led by Sen. John Ashcroft of Missouri over whether
indictment of a president could come while he was in office.
</P>
<P>
   Those speaking before his judiciary subcommittee on the still
unresolved constitutional issue included a couple of scholars, some
lawyers and a senator or two.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft, a potential GOP presidential candidate who already has
called for Clinton's resignation, made it clear that he believed
the criminal process could be applied to a president, impeached or
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``No man is above the law,'' he said. ``The president is subject
to the law, not above it. If he violates the law, he can be
prosecuted.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``as long as impeachment remains a viable option,
impeachment should be the preferred course.''
</P>
<P>
   Akhil Reed Amar, who teaches constitutional law at Yale Law
School, disagreed: ``The president is elected by the entire nation,
and should be judged by the entire nation. His true grand jury is
the House...and the true indictment that he is subject to is called
an impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Rient, a former assistant to Watergate prosecutor Leon
Jaworski, argued _ unsuccessfully _ in 1974 that President Nixon
should be indicted for crimes related to Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surely,'' he said, ``it has not become necessary to hold our
leader to a lesser standard than the minimal standard that all
other citizens must meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those who argued that the Constitution did not protect a
president was Jonathan Turley, who teaches law at George Washington
University Law School and also is a television legal analyst.
</P>
<P>
   He irritated Sen. Robert Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat and
the only other senator attending the hearing, when he began to
comment directly on President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter who you ask, this president came dangerously close
or possibly crossed the criminal line,'' Turley said. ``When he
crossed that line, he emerged not as a president but as a
citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Torricelli interjected that no one knew yet what
was in Starr's report: ``I think you are crossing the line of
responsibility yourself; this is a judgment better reserved for
future weeks.''

TOWN'S RESIDENTS SURPRISED BY GIFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN PETTERSON  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUTCHINSON, Kan. _ Delos V. Smith Jr. wasn't the kind of guy you
could easily forget. And he always liked it that way.
</P>
<P>
   He had long hair, a bushy gray beard and when most folks saw him
he was wearing sweatpants, a sweatshirt and a pair of well-worn
tennis shoes. He liked to be comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times, I suppose, that if you saw him, you would
think this is one of those people who doesn't have a home maybe,''
recalled John Shaffer, a longtime friend.
</P>
<P>
   Those people would have been wrong, dead wrong, because Smith
was among the richest in town.
</P>
<P>
   Few knew it. Even some of those closest to him were unaware of
the extent of his wealth until the Hollywood and Broadway character
actor died last September at 91, leaving millions of dollars to
benefit the town's older residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he had some farms, but I really didn't know he had that
wealth,'' said Earline Polk, during a break in her duties at the
Delos V. Smith Senior Center. ``He cleaned the bathrooms until
about seven months before he died, saving money for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who returned to Hutchinson at the age of 70, established
the center for Hutchinson's older residents about 10 years ago in
memory of his father, Delos V. Smith Sr., who had been a prosperous
businessman in Hutchinson.
</P>
<P>
   He endowed it with $1.2 million and was active in its operation.
He would not allow it to accept city, state or federal money.
</P>
<P>
   His estate was valued about $14 million, and once everything is
settled the money will go to the foundation that operates the
senior center. The foundation isn't required to spend all the money
on the center, but it won't ever have to worry about the future. It
operates on an annual budget of $50,000 to $60,000.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Lee, a longtime friend of the actor who is co-executor of
Smith's estate with Shaffer, said the foundation would use the
money to benefit the town's senior citizens and would be sensitive
to Smith's wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Wanda Thomas, a volunteer at the center, predicted, ``I think
this place will probably go on forever, until the end of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the millions he left to the town's older residents,
Smith is remembered more for being an eccentric former character
actor with a twinkle in his eye. He's remembered for his wealth of
stories about famous people, his insatiable thirst for knowledge,
for being a friend and mentor.
</P>
<P>
   In two of the senior center's offices hang an array of aging
autographed photographs of the stars of film and stage, of sports
and music.
</P>
<P>
   One is a nude photo of the famous fan dancer Sally Rand. She
appeared once at the Kansas State Fair in Hutchinson, and Smith
invited her to his home to meet some of the townsfolk.
</P>
<P>
   Shaffer was there, and he recalled that guests included some of
the town's prominent bankers. ``They were very attentive,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Smith escorted Marilyn Monroe to events, including
the time she sang for President John F. Kennedy at his birthday
party.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps his best known movie credit is ``One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest'' where he played the part of Dr. Scanlon, a
psychiatric patient. Once he rented the videotape and set up chairs
in front of the television at the senior center. About 200 people
turned out to watch Smith in action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some didn't like the language, but no one left,'' Polk
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   He also was in ``Splendor in the Grass,'' ``Goodbye, Columbus,''
``Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,'' ``An Enemy of the
People'' and ``Bound for Glory.''
</P>
<P>
   On Broadway, he was in ``Front Page'' with Helen Hayes, ``Our
Town'' with Henry Fonda and ``Fun Couple'' with Jane Fonda.
</P>
<P>
   He signed on with touring Broadway companies and appeared on
television programs and in TV commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a handsome young man, earlier'' Shaffer said. ``As he
got older he just let his beard grow. As he said, if he just let it
grow and got called for a part and if they wanted it shorter he
could cut it off, but he couldn't grow it.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the people Smith was a mentor for was Mitch Brian, who
used to live in Hutchinson but now is a movie and television
screenwriter in Fairway.
</P>
<P>
   When Brian decided to go to film school in California, Smith
went with him and introduced him to some of his old friends in the
business.
</P>
<P>
   While Brian was on the West Coast, he exchanged letters almost
weekly with Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always such a great teacher and such a great friend,''
Brian said. ``He was an amazing force in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   In his last years, Smith spent most of his time at a desk at the
senior center or in a cluttered office there. He spent hours
reading books and newspapers or writing letters to friends.
</P>
<P>
   Brian recalled that one of the last books Smith read was on
death:
</P>
<P>
   ``He was studying for the big final on that one, too.''

<P>
   In a sign that President Clinton's approval among clergy members
is eroding in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, two leading
religious figures in New York _ one Protestant and one Jewish _
said in interviews Thursday that Clinton had lost his moral
authority and ought to resign.
</P>
<P>
   The comments _ by Ismar Schorsch, chancellor of Jewish
Theological Seminary, and Episcopal Bishop Richard Grein of New
York _ came the day before dozens of clergy members are to attend a
breakfast with Clinton in Washington, a gathering that has become a
regular, late summer event at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Schorsch, a leading figure within Judaism's Conservative
movement, said he did not think Clinton's moral authority had been
eroded, but rather ``destroyed'' as a result of the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The chancellor, who described himself as a former ``great
admirer'' of Clinton, said he came to believe the president should
step down when Clinton went on national television on Aug. 17 to
acknowledge he had had an inappropriate relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate interview, a similar opinion about the president
was expressed by Grein, whose position in New York makes him a
senior bishop in the Episcopal Church.
</P>
<P>
   cop``I think his moral presence in the country has been undercut
so badly that he can't lead,'' Grein said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Schorsch, Grein said he reached that conclusion about the
time of Clinton's television speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you're caught in a lie, you're a dead duck,'' the bishop
said. ``And it was just about then that I thought, he's got to step
down.''
</P>
<P>
   The remarks by Schorsch and Grein are unusual on two counts.
Since the scandal broke last January, many clergy members have
taken a cautious approach, urging prayer and restraint in judgment.
Those who have called for Clinton's resignation have often been
religious conservatives, a group critical of the president for
liberal stands on social policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Paige Patterson, president of the Southern
Baptist Convention, called on Clinton to step down at once.
Patterson repeated that position in an interview Thursday but said
he did so out of concern for Clinton, so he would not have to face
public exposure from the findings in the investigation by the
Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to be alone with God, rebuilding his life and moral
commitment and his family,'' Patterson said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton is a Southern Baptist, he and Patterson come
from different wings of the denomination, which has been controlled
by theological conservatives since the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Schorsch nor Grein was among those invited to Friday's
White House breakfast. A White House spokeswoman said that ``a core
group'' of religious leaders was invited annually to the
breakfasts, and that the White House tried to include others each
year.
</P>
<P>
   Schorsch said he attended a similar event in 1993 and heard the
president declare the need for religious tolerance in a pluralistic
society. ``I was very impressed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has become known for the fluency of his religious
language and his willingness to engage in discussions with clergy
members, as individuals and in groups.
</P>
<P>
   One nationally prominent minister who will attend Friday's
breakfast, the Rev. Joan Brown Campbell, general secretary of the
National Council of Churches, said she was not prepared to call for
Clinton's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a rush to judgment that I am not prepared to make,''
Ms. Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   But she added, ``The nation has to be clear that when people do
sinful acts _ which we all do _ there have to be consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she thought that a censure by Congress of Clinton
``might be necessary'' for the country to feel it was moving ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Paraphrasing Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa,
Ms. Campbell said that without forgiveness, there could be no
healing. But for there to be forgiveness, she said, ``being
repentant is essential.''
</P>
<P>
   Schorsch and Grein said they had shared their feelings about
Clinton with few others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've not talked a lot about it because I'm so depressed,''
Schorsch said. Grein said he felt bad for the president, the nation
``and for everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   One religious leader who has declined to comment is Cardinal
John O'Connor, Catholic archbishop of New York. Writing in the
archdiocesan newspaper, Catholic New York, last week, he said, ``Do
I advance the salvation of souls by publicizing my own speculation
or by offering my own verdict? I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor wrote that he was ``very, very busy praying'' for the
Clintons, for those in Congress who would judge the president and
for the nation, ``which, in my judgment, is more deeply in need of
prayer than at any point during my 78 years as a citizen.''

YELTSIN BACKS DOWN, NOMINATES PRIMAKOV 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In a dramatic retreat from a showdown with parliament,
President Boris Yeltsin nominated Thursday a candidate for prime
minister demanded by opposition lawmakers to tackle Russia's
economic crisis _ former spy chief and Acting Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
   Communists and liberals alike hailed Yeltsin's move and
predicted an easy approval vote when the Duma votes Friday after a
number of developments that underscored important shifts in
Russia's power hierachy.
</P>
<P>
   Viewed as a hawk in the West for his efforts as foreign minister
to counter American influence, Primakov has limited economic
experience and offered nothing Thursday about his plans to save
Russia from financial disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the gruff 68-year-old career intelligence officer and
diplomat, who has served as an adviser to three Soviet Communist
Party General Secretaries before joining Yeltsin's Cabinet, is
considered a pragmatic consensus-builder and a popular figure
across the country's broad political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   By naming Primakov, Yeltsin immediately defused a political
crisis that has paralyzed the central government amid fears of
civil unrest as the country suffers through its worst economic
crisis since the 1991 Soviet collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials expressed cautious optimism over Primakov's
appointment. At a meeting Thursday with leaders of the European
Union, Primakov ``again underlined the importance of political and
economic reforms in this country,'' said Peter Hohenfeller, a
senior Austrian Foreign Ministry official.
</P>
<P>
   More important perhaps, Primakov's nomination was a stark
admission by the Russian leader that he could no longer force his
will upon the State Duma, the lower house of parliament. This was
the first time that he has backed down from the Duma, created in
1993 after Yeltsin subdued the previous legislature with tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin had vowed to force lawmakers to accept his preferred
candidate, former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. His
uncharacteristic retreat was also widely seen as the clearest sign
yet of the Russian leader's increasing political, and probably
physical, weakness.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Yeltsin, who has spent most of the past month
sequestered in his suburban residence, relented after lawmakers
emphatically rejected Chernomyrdin twice in the past two weeks. A
third ``no'' vote against Chernomyrdin would have forced him to
dissolve the Duma -- a scenario that had stoked fears of a new
civil conflict. Many Russians blame Chernomyrdin, who served as
prime minister for five years until Yeltsin fired him in March and
has been acting premier since Aug. 23, for the country's economic
troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Common sense has prevailed in our land,'' said Communist
leader Gennady Zyuganov, who led the opposition to Chernomyrdin,
after Yeltsin nominated Primakov.
</P>
<P>
   ``At last, the president has agreed to someone else's
proposal,'' added Grigory Yavlinsky, a liberal Duma member who
first proposed Primakov as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers celebrated their victory while ordinary Russians coped
with a series of unpredictable rises and falls of the ruble that
complicated an already confusing and damaging crisis. Meanwhile,
the talk in Moscow political circles was of a dramatic shift in the
balance of power in Russia's political hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin warned in a televised address that ``leftist
forces'' were planning a ``creeping coup'' to oust Yeltsin and
restore a Soviet-style system.
</P>
<P>
   Few analysts and politicians went that far. But some predicted a
shift under Primakov from the current system in which Yeltsin has
almost total control over government policy at the expense of the
Duma.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something the West has to get used to: the end of a
government of reformers who try to implement market reforms without
consensus,'' said Alan Rousso, director of the Moscow Carnegie
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Foreshadowing that change, Kremlin spokesman Sergei
Yastrzhembsky Thursday said that Primakov was likely to appoint as
a senior economic aide Yury Maslyukov, the Communist chairman of
the Duma's Ecnomics committee and the former head of the body that
administered the Soviet Union's planned economy. ``But (Primakov)
will make that decision,'' Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
   This was another stunning reversal for Yeltsin, who has always
insisted onmaking cabinet appointments himself.
</P>
<P>
   At issue now is how Primakov will tackle the crisis. Almost
everyone in Russia wants the government to pump rubles into an
economy so cash-strapped that barter has all but replaced money in
most sectors under the monetarist policies of the previous
government and ousted Central Bank Chairman Sergei Dubinin.
Primakov is believed to consider as a replacement Viktor
Geraschenko, who, as the bank's chairman until 1994, championed
easy credits to industry and has broad support in the Duma.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for democracy, but not necessarily for the
economy,'' commented Sergei Morkov of the Moscow-based institute
for Political Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Some Russian and Western economists warn that printing rubles
will lead to hyperinflation and social unrest. But, Russian
legislators counter, social unrest is already here, in the form of
millions of unpaid workers. Thursday at the Duma, workers from
Russia's secret nuclear weapons facilities demanded late wages
that, as one poster put it, ``threaten the earth with
annihilation.''
</P>
<P>
   Some legislators, like liberal lawmaker Vladimir Averchev,
believe that Primakov's main function as prime minister is to
provide Russia with steady leadership during the dying days of the
Yeltsin regime. This challenge will become particularly important
if a transition occurs before the next scheduled presidential
elections in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one expects an economic miracle from Primakov,'' Averchev
said. ``At the same time, he is not a candidate for president and
doesn't rouse any negative emotions in Yeltsin or anyone else. And
who is more capable of conducting early elections in a fair way
than Primakov?''
</P>
<P>
   But while legislators seemed more preoccupied with the end of
Russia's political stalemate, some analysts worried that the
country's new leaders may not be up to the challenge that confronts
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This stops the bleeding,'' said Rousso about the end of the
current political crisis, ``The question is, is it too late to save
the patient?''

DELACROIX, THAT SKEPTICAL ROMANTIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Exhibition notes at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Visitors to the Pere Lachaise cemetery in Paris
are sometimes struck that Delacroix's grave is a gray granite box
of neo-classical design. The tomb of his friend the tubercular
Chopin seems, more appropriately, Romantic by comparison, and it
attracts a stream of admirers who leave flowers, candles and throat
lozenges. No one hangs around Delacroix's grave.
</P>
<P>
   In 1859, four years before Delacroix died at 65, the artist
Redon provided this description of him at a ball: ``He was as
beautiful as a tiger, the same pride, the same finesse, the same
strength. Fine boned and aristocratic, he stood upright and alone,
in front of a group of women who were sitting in the ballroom.''
When Delacroix left early, Redon followed at a discreet distance
and was startled to see that Delacroix walked by himself for hours
through the Paris streets.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, he was affectionate, courageous, loyal and
patriotic. Gautier said, ``Nobody was more charming than he was,
when he took the trouble to be so,'' by which he underscored that
Delacroix was by nature a solitary man. He never married. In his
later years, he was often ill. He spent a lot of time reading
Racine, Horace and Stendhal and copying passages from Voltaire.
Mostly, he worked. The scale of his ambition demanded solitude.
</P>
<P>
   A show of his late paintings and drawings opens here at the
Museum of Art on Tuesday. (It's already open to museum members.)
When it was at the Grand Palais a few months ago, some of my French
friends grumbled about it. They sounded as if they were tired of
Delacroix, the way an American might claim to be tired of, say,
Hemingway. Too much heroism. Too much gloire.
</P>
<P>
   I sped through the Paris show. The crowds were big, the layout
was awful, and I was disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   But now, having taken time with the exhibition here, which is
installed somewhat better, I've come away feeling differently.
Delacroix can't be appreciated at a glance. He reminds us why we
care about art in the first place. If you look quickly at his
pictures, you may only see the lions and horses and the scenes from
books that almost nobody reads anymore. All of it can seem
ridiculously remote, and you get no good sense for how he paints,
which is what really matters.
</P>
<P>
   He was absorbed by the physical act of painting, which came to
have for him an almost erotic charge. ``For the last four months,''
he wrote in his journal, ``I have been getting up at dawn and
hurrying off to this enchanting work as though I were rushing to
throw myself at the feet of a beloved mistress.''
</P>
<P>
   Isn't this the soul of the creative process?
</P>
<P>
   But I mentioned at the start the tomb, and Horace and Voltaire
and Stendhal: Delacroix was, like all interesting people,
contradictory. We don't begin to understand his late years unless
we recognize this fact. The textbook Romantic, he actually looked
on contemporary life with a certain stoical skepticism _ with
increasingly crotchety annoyance is more like it _ longing for a
Classical world whose sensibility he emulated.
</P>
<P>
   It's often pointed out, for instance, that he especially loved
Morocco because he thought he discovered there a world unchanged
since antiquity. ``Each one a Cato or a Brutus,'' was his famous
description of the Moroccans, and in his work he gave to them a
dignity that other European artists never would, or never could.
</P>
<P>
   I'd add that even more than the subjects of the late pictures,
it is his taste in books and in other artists that reveals his
classical inclination best. His journal is instructive. Its tone
becomes cooler as the years go by. He hated all vulgarity and
sentimentality, never mind that these were precisely the qualities
his critics saw in his paintings. He insisted that passion should
always be moderated by reason.
</P>
<P>
   Poe was too much for him. He admired Stendhal because Stendhal
knew when to leave things unsaid, which Delacroix regarded as ``a
great art, and one unknown to novices.'' For the same reason, he
valued Veronese, who had ``the knack of not doing too much, and
that apparent disregard for detail that makes the work look so
simple and straightforward.'' He probably would have disliked much
of the art of this century. He'd have thought it self-indulgent.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, we identify with him because his temperament is
familiar: He was world weary and anxious, politically mercurial
during a time when the political situation was fluid. It has become
a cliche that he was both the greatest religious painter of the
19th century and a skeptic. It's also true, as is sometimes said
(Lee Johnson, the Delacroix scholar, and Vincent Pomarede, one of
the show's curators, both say it in the excellent exhibition
catalog), that his religious paintings tended to be grim
meditations on solitude, suffering and death, or they depicted the
awful precariousness of everything. He was a religious painter, in
other words, but not one who showed peace on earth and the glory of
God triumphant.
</P>
<P>
   If one of his best late pictures, the little ``Good Samaritan,''
seems to contradict this fact, its underlying message is actually
that people are usually unfeeling and hypocritical. The Samaritan,
a man of heroic tenderness, is the exception.
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, Delacroix returned again and again in his
last years to the subject of Jesus on the Sea of Galilee, his
response, in part, to Gericault's mordant ``Wreck of the Medusa,''
for which Delacroix had posed decades earlier. He was not Monet
before the fact: I can't imagine that he ever thought about this as
a coherent series, as the show's organizers imply. But he was an
obsessive, and for him the image must have been attractive because
it had to do with the metaphor of life as a sea of troubles. It was
about inconstant faith, Delacroix's own condition.
</P>
<P>
   He told George Sand: ``There are horrid things in this world,
but, after all, what shall we find beyond it? Night, dreadful
night.'' Presumably what he meant was that his only real faith in
the end was in art: Art posed formal challenges for an artist that,
if solved, provided the best chance at immortality from a doubter's
point of view.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   So he returned to certain formal problems even in very different
types of pictures, as if these problems, and not necessarily the
subjects he painted, were the point of his art. The twisting
soldier in ``Moroccan Troops Fording a River'' _ hips skewed,
shoulders turned, head to the side _ is like the naked women in
``Marfisa and Pinabello's Lady.'' The ``View of Tangier From the
Seashore'' resembles ``The Entombment,'' which was painted at the
same time. Tangier, on a distant hill, is illuminated beyond two
huge rocks that make an opening from foreground to background.
Figures as if from classical sculptures struggle to heave a boat
from the water.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Entombment,'' Delacroix paints a similar pathway
between rocky walls, dividing dark from light, foreground from
background, the figures struggling this time with Jesus' body.
</P>
<P>
   These links may be a little tenuous, but they point out how
insular Delacroix's art can seem, how everything in it belongs to a
world of his design. Works that look spontaneous were painstakingly
made and were distilled from memory: He had visited Morocco decades
earlier. What Wordsworth once said about emotion needing to be
recollected in tranquility was exactly Delacroix's approach.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the aura: Space seems to be collapsed, the air is like
molasses. Everything is amber, blue and red, a palette in which
color become its own end. All the images exist at pretty much the
same high level of intensity and tonal saturation, with the result
that even when the work isn't great, you get the sense, as you do
from all great artists, of total absorption, complete commitment.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, what is memorable about this show is that it's about
the art of an adult. Dumas said, ``The genius of Delacroix is not
debatable, it is not demonstrable, it is something one feels.''
That's right. It can't be pigeonholed as Romantic or Orientalist or
modern because it encompasses the paradoxes of a serious,
self-examined life. Nothing is simple in Delacroix's mature work;
the reason is that nothing was simply done. Even his bad paintings
are reminders of how much he labored over the good ones.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his energies in later years were spent on big public
mural projects, but it's revealing that he also devoted a lot of
time to drawing and painting what he grew in his garden: anemones,
dahlias, asters. He wanted to show nature without Romantic
hyperbole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am beginning to feel a violent dislike for people like
Schubert, the dreamers like Chateaubriand, Lamartine, etc.,'' he
wrote, contrasting the experience of their works with a walk in the
country. ``I made some enchanting discoveries, rocks and woods and
best of all water _ water of which I never grow tired: I feel a
continual longing to plunge into it, to be a bird, a tree whose
roots are steeped in it, to be anything except an unhappy, sick,
bored old man.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition gives us his painting of tiny boats skating on
slick, silver water, a little miracle; and an astonishing, lapidary
watercolor and pastel of marigolds, daisies and roses. His big
paintings of flowers are monumental and have an architecture of
design that makes them equal in ambition to any of his literary or
religious pictures.
</P>
<P>
   The flower pictures may come as a revelation to some people. A
painter of famously boyish enthusiasms _ he got all those blood and
thunder images from reading things like Walter Scott when he was
younger _ Delacroix in his later years made poetry out of
hollyhocks and hydrangeas. I'd never really appreciated his mature
flower pictures before. I suppose I'm getting older.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard not to keep quoting from his journal; of the great
artists, he was clearly the greatest writer. In 1857, when he was
59, he wrote: ``Youth, which seems to be the happiest time of our
lives, does not excite my envy in the slightest degree; at most I
envy the bodily strength that makes it possible to tackle great
works, but I do not envy at all the pleasures that accompany it.
What I should like _ and of course, this is just as impossible as
to grow young again _ would be to stay at my present age and have
long enjoyment of the advantages it gives to a mind that has grown,
I won't say disillusioned, but genuinely reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent biography says Delacroix spent his final weeks at home,
writing to friends, struggling to work, eating figs and ice cream
and reading to his manservant. It sounds typically Romantic. But it
was he who decided, just before he died, that his tomb at Pere
Lachaise would have no statues or busts of him. He wanted to keep
it simple. He was thinking of the Classical ideal to the end.
</P>
<P>
   EXHIBITION NOTES:
</P>
<P>
   ``DELACROIX: THE LATE WORK'' opens on Tuesday at the
Philadelphia Museum of Art, 26th Street and Benjamin Franklin
Parkway (it is now open to museum members). It has been organized
and installed by Joseph Rishel, the museum's chief curator, and
will remain on view through Jan. 3.

`CUBE' TOYS WITH HUMAN PSYCHE IN DIRE STRAITS

   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Half a dozen Canadians wake up inside a bizarre,
high-tech cell. Not knowing one another nor how or why they got
there, all they can see is that the square enclosure's four walls,
floor and ceiling look like giant, ominous computer chips. Each
surface has a doorway that leads to a similar, different colored
space. Choose to go through the wrong one, however, and booby traps
deliver swift, awful death.
</P>
<P>
   This is ``Cube,'' the sorta sci fi-ish, slightly existential,
super-claustrophobic feature directing debut of Toronto-based
Vincenzo Natali. A limited-concept movie if there ever was one, it
increasingly tries one's patience the longer it goes on past the
``Twilight Zone'' episode length its story and design elements
could naturally sustain.
</P>
<P>
   But having backed himself into a formal corner, Natali at least
tries, with varying success, to dramatically trick up the gimmick.
</P>
<P>
   He looses violent, if rather pat, personality conflicts among
the human rats in his maze, especially between the dominant male, a
cop named Quentin (Maurice Dean Wint), snooty feminist doctor
Holloway (Nicky Guadagni) and nihilistic engineer Worth (David
Hewlett), who knows more about the Cube than he wants to admit.
</P>
<P>
   With the addition of math genius Leaven (Nicole de Boer),
autistic savant Kazan (Andrew Miller) and criminal escape artist
Rennes (Wayne Robson), it emerges that each individual has
something to contribute to the group's survival and, if there is
such a thing, escape. Hopefully, the tiring, hungry and extremely
stressed-out pawns in this infernal game won't kill whoever the
Cube doesn't before they reach the end.
</P>
<P>
   The most intriguing and intense aspect of ``Cube'' is the way it
evolves into a geometrical thriller _ it would make a good double
feature with another of this summer's low-budget indies, ``Pi.''
That film, however, used its numbers-crunching theme as the
jumping-off point for a deeper, specific examination of paranoia,
megalomania and the nature of existence. And it hardly needs
mentioning, yet must be noted, that ``Pi'' did not have the burden
of practically every shot looking like the last one and the next
one, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cube'' does differentiate a few scenes with some expertly
disgusting special effects. One guy gets sliced into geometric
chunks by an invisible mesh of wires; you've gotta love the
obsessive design consciousness that went into that one, even if it
does make you nauseous.

`ROUNDERS' FLUSH WITH POKER ACTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 2{ Stars 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Rounders'' is a poker movie that spends a lot of
time talking about suckers and amateurs (Georges, they're called)
and the telltale signs they give that reveal the cards in their
hands. But the filmmakers themselves often come off as a bunch of
rubes, exposing every plot development long before it actually
happens. Appealing performances from Matt Damon and Edward Norton
and some fun card table theatrics make up for story's rambling
shuffle through predictable territory, but whether you should ante
up the price of admission might depend on the size of your
bankroll. Waiting for the video could be the wiser bet.
</P>
<P>
   Damon plays Mike McDermott, a sharp, young guy who was paying
for his New York law school education by playing poker until the
night he lost his whole savings _ some $33,000 _ on one hand to an
Oreo-eating Russian mobster named KGB (John Malkovich). Mike
doesn't gamble anymore, mostly, it seems, to appease his
long-suffering girlfriend (Gretchen Mol in a thankless role), who
has stuck with him through good times and bad.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the way this movie stacks its deck, you know it's
only a matter of time before Mike hits the gaming tables again. The
impetus is the return of his old friend Worm (Norton), an endearing
scuzzball recently paroled from prison after serving a few years
for a scam he pulled with Mike.
</P>
<P>
   Worm owes big money to a neighborhood thug, Grama (Michael
Rispoli), and he needs to raise some cash _ and fast. So he asks
Mike to spot him some seed money, find him some poker games and
maybe play a few hands with him, too. If Mike doesn't help, Worm is
going to find himself eating Oreo cookies through a straw. Big on
loyalty, Mike agrees.
</P>
<P>
   Damon, playing the angelic Mike (look at the glowing way he is
photographed throughout the film), and Norton, as the devil
whispering into his ear, have a nice chemistry and when director
John Dahl turns them loose, ``Rounders'' (the term for players who
know all the angles) can be a lot of fun. Writers David Levien and
Brian Koppleman relish the language of the games and the film has
some wonderful moments that give us insider looks into the
mind-sets of the poker-playing greats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poker is like the Nature Channel,'' Damon's Mike explains as
we see a table full of card sharps draining the bank accounts of a
couple of rookies. ``You don't see piranhas eating each other, do
you?''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, too much of ``Rounders'' follows familiar
Hollywood rituals. As soon as Mike's law professor (Martin Landau)
takes him aside and advises, ``We can't run away from who we are,''
you know how the rest of the deck is going to play for Mike _
failure, comeback and a chance at redemption against KGB. Once the
movie runs out of ideas, all the card playing starts to become
repetitive and the telling detail at the big showdown is so obvious
that a rank amateur could spot it a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   Malkovich is a guilty pleasure, chewing up scenery with a thick
Russian accent that must have produced an awful problem with
phlegm. (Sample line: ``Hooo-kay, you sun of a beeeech.'') Famke
Janssen turns up as a glamorous poker club maven who (like every
other woman in the film) has eyes for Mike, and John Turturro has a
nice scene or two playing a cautious elder poker king.
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad that for all the colorful language and supporting
characters ``Rounders'' couldn't have called Hollywood's bluff and
come up with a more original story. It's a movie that delivers its
audience a decent hand, but in the end, it's a couple of cards
short of being a real winner.

NAMES HAVE BEEN CHANGED... STORY, TOO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 2{ Stars 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Novelist John Irving says that he's requested all
names be changed in ``Simon Birch'' from those in his book ``A
Prayer for Owen Meany'' because the movie is so different from the
story he wrote, not because he doesn't like it.
</P>
<P>
   While the former point is provable, the latter one's a bit hard
to believe. Not that Irving is the most rigorous of literary
lights. Movie versions of both ``The World According to Garp'' and
``The Hotel New Hampshire'' came with noticeable doses of the
self-satisfied cutes, and there's obviously a reason why filmmakers
consistently isolate that aspect of his work. But ``Simon Birch''
is so 
gooey/sensitive/conventional-in-its-championing-of-unconventionality
 earnestness that you can't imagine even Irving thinks it's not
sappy.
</P>
<P>
   If you want adorable, though, this is definitely the movie for
you. Especially when 11-year-old Ian Michael Smith, as the
diminutive title hero, is asking out loud what God's plan for him
might be or expressing his admiration for a classmate's budding
bosom, it takes a very stoney face indeed not to break into an
appreciative ``aww.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith has a growth-impairing medical condition, but that's not
what makes him perfect casting for dwarf saint Simon/Owen. Smith
possesses a thoroughly winning, open emotionality and an infectious
mischievousness that goes a long way toward making the movie's
schmaltzy agenda palatable.
</P>
<P>
   Narrated in one long flashback by Simon's childhood pal Joe
Wenteworth (an uncredited Jim Carrey in the modern-day framing
scenes, ``Jurassic Park's'' Joseph Mazzello in the film's '60s-set
main body), it's like a Reader's Digest ``Most Inspirational Person
I've Ever Met'' essay gone fuzzily out of control. Joe and Simon
are the town outcasts in a sun-dappled New England village; Simon
for obvious physical reasons, Joe because his luminous mother,
Rebecca (Ashley Judd), has never seen fit to identify his father.
</P>
<P>
   Barely tolerated by his own grim parents, Simon is fussed over
and defended against shrill Sunday school teachers by Rebecca. An
absurd tragedy soon fills Simon with guilt, however, while making
it more imperative for Joe to find out who his father is. As
revelations both fateful and temporal unfold, the whole thing
abruptly turns into a rehash of ``The Sweet Hereafter'' _ a movie
that hardly cries for cloning, and particularly not a clone that
goes full-speed down the road to bathetic melodrama ``Hereafter''
so thoughtfully avoided.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of absent thoughtfulness, ``Meany'' fans are likely to
miss the book's references to Vietnam and contemplations on the
nature of miracles, among other qualities. The director is Mark
Steven Johnson, best known for writing ``Grumpy Old Men'' movies.
He's also credited with ``extrapolating'' ``Birch's'' screenplay
from ``Owen Meany.'' That's a new one, at least.
</P>
<P>
   No surprise, Johnson displays more of a knack for directing the
comic, rather than the dramatic, scenes. A Christmas pageant
demolished by Simon's emerging little libido is particularly fun,
as are most scenes involving the semi-hysterical church lady (Jan
Hooks, being a real good sport about it) that he loves to torment.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, Oliver Platt as Rebecca's patient, understanding
suitor and David Strathairn as an uptight preacher are clearly
meant to be significant figures, but they fail to really register.
In fact, most of what is affecting about ``Simon Birch'' fails to
linger long in the memory; it's as forgettable as it is adorable.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Without Limits'' is the second disappointing
movie made about track star Steve Prefontaine to arrive in theaters
in the past two years. With a subject as interesting as
Prefontaine, I'm tempted to say that the third time would be the
charm, but I doubt that studios will see it that way. After these
two false starts (Disney's little-seen ``Pre'' being the other
film), chances are Prefontaine will be disqualified from any future
biopic competitions.
</P>
<P>
   Prefontaine isn't widely known to the general public, mostly
because he never won a medal in the Olympics, track's most visible
spectacle of competition. During his career as an amateur athlete,
though, he held most distance records between 2,000 and 10,000
meters and never lost a race in the United States. On top of that,
Prefontaine was handsome, charismatic and had a rock star's touch
when it came to working a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Acclaimed screenwriter Robert Towne (``Chinatown'') has spent
several years working on this film, directing it as well as
co-writing the screenplay with Sports Illustrated journalist and
former champion runner Kenny Moore. It's disappointing, then, that
``Without Limits'' adheres so conventionally to the cliches of the
jock movie genre and provides only the briefest of glimpses into
the psyche of the track star it means to celebrate. Towne shows us
the events that made Prefontaine famous but misses the opportunity
to explain the circumstances that molded him into the
single-minded, gutsy athlete he became.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Limits,'' like countless other sports movies before
it, follows a familiar trajectory. We meet Prefontaine (Billy
Crudup) as a successful high school runner who is highly coveted by
every university possessing a top track and field program.
</P>
<P>
   Pre, however, has his mind set on going to the University of
Oregon so he can compete for the school's larger-than-life track
coach Bill Bowerman (Donald Sutherland). We know Bowerman's a good
coach, if for no other reason than he sports the same kind of hats
that Tom Landry and Bear Bryant wore on the sidelines. That and the
fact that he's a poet when it comes time to give a pep talk, not to
mention that he invented the first Nike running shoe.
</P>
<P>
   Once Pre hits college, he inevitably clashes with the
strong-willed Bowerman, who wants his charge to pace himself during
races, believing that's the way to faster times. Pre will have none
of it. He has always run out front _ any other way is
``chicken----,'' he says. The movie attempts to provide some
psychological justification for this belief through some awkward
childhood footrace flashbacks, but we never do learn much about why
Prefontaine does this _ or anything else.
</P>
<P>
   So Pre wins, then wins big and then inevitably loses and faces a
Moment of Truth, where he can either quit or do what it takes to
get back and be all that he can be. There are such time-honored
devices as The Pep Talk and The Reluctant Girlfriend. And whenever
Towne isn't sure we understand just how great his subject is, he
has the network announcers explain the legend for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Limits'' certainly has its merits. Prefontaine's life
is inherently interesting, and Towne manages some interesting notes
with the relationship between Pre and Bowerman. The races
themselves crackle with electricity, particularly Prefontaine's
justly famous contest at the 1972 Munich Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   But time and time again the film settles for the expected
instead of trying anything engaging or new. There were some
half-dozen times where I heard a character say a line and knew
exactly what the piece of dialogue would be. One example came
during an anguished confrontation between Pre and his coach over
whether he should run a race with an injured foot.
</P>
<P>
   Bowerman: You don't know what it will do to your foot if you try
to run.
</P>
<P>
   Pre: You don't know what it will do to my foot if I do run, but
you DO know what it'll do to me if I don't.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen Nike commercials with better exchanges. And that's too
bad, because there's a good movie to be made about the life of
Steve Prefontaine. Sadly, I don't think we're ever going to see it.

   WASHINGTON _ There is a grim joke current among Sens. Barbara
Boxer, Carol Mosely-Braun and Patty Murray, the celebrated victors
of the ``Year of the Woman'' elections of 1992 when the notion that
some male politicians ``just don't get it'' helped drive their
victory campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're running again in what we call the `Year of the
Woman-Target,''' Ms. Mosely-Braun of Illinois said, noting all
three Democratic women, who first won amid a wave of voter concern
about the explosive issue of sex and politics, are in tight
re-election races.
</P>
<P>
   The victors made a banner issue of sexual harassment in the
political workplace that was first underlined in Anita Hill's
harassment charges during Clarence Thomas' confirmation hearings
for the Supreme Court. The new senators then helped to force the
Senate ethics process that led to the resignation of Sen. Bob
Packwood on sexual harassment charges.
</P>
<P>
   The senators were already in tight races for varied political
reasons, and the president's misconduct inquiry, landing in
Congress as the campaign is in the home stretch, may only compound
their vulnerability. The ``Year of the Woman'' victors have had to
rebut criticism that they have been more considerate of the
president then they were of Packwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was personally hurt, because I was going around saying I
believed in the president,'' Ms. Mosely-Braun said as political
queasiness swept Democratic ranks at the advent of the independent
counsel's report on the president's alleged misdeeds. ``I was
caught flat-footed by his admitting he lied. I was not a happy
camper.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents have not been wasting the sound-bite opportunities
offered by the president's misdeeds. ``Barbara, your silence on
this issue is deafening,'' California Treasurer Matt Fong, Mrs.
Boxer's opponent, told her in a debate last month, even as she
protested to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   One of Ms. Murray's opponents, Rep. Linda Smith of Washington,
makes a similar accusation of silence, playing on the senator's
signature ``mom in tennis shoes'' campaign image. ``She seems to
have traded in her tennis shoes for a pair of hush puppies,'' she
tells state voters.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Murray, who describes herself as ``upset and angry'' at the
president for his private behavior, insists that her constituents
have been raising health care, education and other issues, not the
president's sexual misbehavior. ``They aren't focused on that,''
she told reporters at a Labor Day rally in her home state. ``They
are focused on what is real to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say the problem posed by Clinton for his party's
candidates is far broader than gender politics. ``Democrats are
running from the president like scalded dogs,'' said Mary Crawford,
spokeswoman for the National Republican Congressional Committee.
``And for women who have been outspoken in other situations where
Republicans were the focus of scrutiny to take a different stance
now will raise another eyebrow among the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, Democratic candidates fear that Clinton's scandal
risks making this the Year of the Albatross for them. The president
conceded as much Wednesday during a Florida visit when he thanked a
local candidate just for being at his side. ``Now that he's stuck
up for me, he may be in some sort of a political disadvantage,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mrs. Boxer, weary after a solid month on the California
hustings, quickly took to the Senate floor this week before the
impeachment report arrived to put her criticism of the president's
personal behavior more prominently in the official record. But she
pleaded no less that other issues of her campaign not become
engulfed by the impeachment storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have another Year of the Woman as a result of all
this,'' Mrs. Boxer said Wednesday at a press luncheon when she was
asked how women candidates and voters might be affected as tales of
the president's misbehavior spill out in graphic detail from the
impeachment inquiry. ``It's possible. Or the opposite is possible.
We could have a depressed turnout. It's volatile.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator personified the volatility as she insisted that
while Clinton still had the moral authority to lead the nation, she
was not sure what to believe about him personally. ``He's done all
these good things and on the policy side I'm in synch with his
agenda,'' she said, adding that Hillary Rodham Clinton, whose
brother is married to Mrs. Boxer's daughter, will be heartily
welcomed in a California campaign visit later this month, as will
the president in October.
</P>
<P>
   To the question of whether the president is now fully truthful,
the senator tersely replied, ``We'll know that when we see the
report.'' The president could have made things easier in this
campaign season by coming clean months ago, Mrs. Boxer said. ``But
if I lose it's my fault,'' she said, maintaining it is her task to
generate a strong voter turnout rather than to blame the president
for depressing Democrats' enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Boxer's split view of the president reflects opinion
polling indicating that while the president's job rating has
remained strong among men and women, he has suffered a sharp drop
in personal approval as the scandal ripened these last eight
months. A low turnout for the election would likely aid the
Republicans, and one Democratic pollster, Celinda Lake, has been
noting that the gender gap lead of Democrats has almost disappeared
among white women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will woman stay home?'' Mrs. Boxer asked, wondering at the
ultimate electoral result as the Clinton scandal inquiry moves
forward. ``Or will they decide: you know, maybe we need more women
in the Congress? We'll see.''

A TOUGH ACT TO FOLLOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There must be a reason _ aside from the usual lack
of originality _ why two animated ant movies are coming out this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the close arrivals of ``Antz'' and ``A Bug's Life''
represent the fact that there are so many releases scheduled
between now and the end of the year that distinguishing particular
films from the pack is going to be like picking out individual
pests at a picnic.
</P>
<P>
   Or it could be a subtle indication that most of the late '98
offerings will be marked by a certain dronelike sameness. After
all, with such atypically distinctive summer fare as ``Saving
Private Ryan,'' ``There's Something About Mary'' and ``The Truman
Show'' still resonating through the pop culture, just how many more
standout ideas can we reasonably expect Hollywood to come up with?
</P>
<P>
   Then again, it could just be movie marketeers' clever way of
indicating that they really want to bug us this season.
</P>
<P>
   While doubling is a notable phenomenon among the year-end
prospects _ besides the insect cartoons, there are two
heart-tuggers about growth-impaired kids (``Simon Birch'' and ``The
Mighty''), dueling Meryl Streep showcases (``One True Thing'' and
``Dancing at Lughnasa'') and a mini-James Jones revival (Terrence
Malick's star-studded film version of Jones' World War II novel
``The Thin Red Line'' and Merchant-Ivory's adaptation of his
offspring's fictionalized memoir ``A Soldier's Daughter Never
Cries'') _ the fall's most interesting film trend is controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Or, at least, the potential for it.
</P>
<P>
   While most distributors hate taking heat for provocative or
upsetting pictures, in this overcrowded season it may be the best
way to distinguish their product from the rest of the pack.
</P>
<P>
   For example, three October releases that address the always
alarming subject of Nazism come with their own extra issues. The
hype-artist/director of the reportedly great skinhead saga
``American History X'' is very vocally disowning the film. Some
underage extras in ``Apt Pupil,'' a Stephen King story about a war
criminal hiding out in an American high school, have claimed that
they were inappropriately asked to do a nude shower scene. And
Roberto Benigni's Italian comedy ``Life Is Beautiful'' unfolds in
the decidedly unfunny setting of a World War II concentration camp.
</P>
<P>
   Internment camps make an unwelcome reappearance, too, in ``The
Siege,'' a political thriller in which Arab-Americans and Muslims
are rounded up in response to a wave of terrorism. Arab-American
and Muslim groups have already responded to the film's promotional
campaign with organized protests.
</P>
<P>
   Other religious groups may have their own complaints about the
comedy ``Holy Man,'' in which Eddie Murphy plays a guru who shills
for a TV shopping network; ``What Dreams May Come,'' the Robin
Williams afterlife fantasy with decidedly nontraditional visions of
heaven and hell; and ``Orgazmo,'' the story of a Mormon porno star.
</P>
<P>
   That one may seem comparatively wholesome when stacked up
against the pedophilia-themed ``Lolita'' remake and ``Happiness,''
a Cannes Film Festival favorite that was nonetheless deemed too
deviant for its original American distributor to release. And at
least two black comedies, ``Clay Pigeons'' and ``Very Bad Things,''
display an unhealthy interest in violence against women _ as,
unavoidably, will the remake of ``Psycho.'' That one's very
existence may make it the most controversial film of the year _
among classic film lovers, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there may be so many troublesome movies this fall
that they cancel each other out _ or, more likely, scare off
audiences completely. Perhaps DreamWorks was right to go way in the
other direction. The studio solicited input from representatives of
numerous religious and ethnic groups to make sure that their
animated Moses spectacular, ``The Prince of Egypt,'' offends
nobody.
</P>
<P>
   Others are hoping that, since fall-style daring movies did so
well this summer, maybe summer-type action entertainments will
catch on now. Chris Tucker teams up with Jackie Chan for the demo
derby ``Rush Hour.'' In ``Ronin,'' Robert De Niro tears up so many
French roads they should've called it ``The American Connection.''
You've already seen the trailers of Will Smith disrupting traffic
as the wrongly accused ``Enemy of the State.'' No word about
vehicular mayhem in the Kurt Russell sci-fi feature ``Soldier,''
but it does take place on a junkyard planet.
</P>
<P>
   On a more traditional note, the Halloween season will be tricked
up with such back-from-the-dead horror genre titles as ``Urban
Legend,'' ``John Carpenter's Vampires,'' ``I Still Know What You
Did Last Summer,'' ``The Faculty'' and _ yikes _ ``Bride of
Chucky.'' This being the supposedly cerebral season as well,
mortality and mysticism might get more serious consideration in the
likes of ``What Dreams,'' ``Jack Frost,'' the Anthony Hopkins-Brad
Pitt ``Meet Joe Black,'' the Sandra Bullock-Nicole Kidman
``Practical Magic'' and the Oprah Winfrey-powered ``Beloved,''
based on Toni Morrison's acclaimed novel.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of acclaim, the traditional Oscar-contention time is
surprisingly light on big-name directors this year. Aside from
``Beloved's'' Jonathan Demme (``Silence of the Lambs''),
``Soldier's Daughter's'' James Ivory (``Howards End'') and the
perennial Woody Allen, it's a pretty thin auteurist line.
</P>
<P>
   Fronted, of course, by ``Red Line's'' Malick (who hasn't made a
movie in 20 years), ``Road Warrior'' stylist George Miller (whose
entry is the sequel to the talking-pig movie ``Babe'') and Gus Van
Sant, who had ``Good Will Hunting'' last year but will need all the
abundant good will Hollywood is famous for to snatch a nomination
for ``Psycho.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Spielberg, start polishing your acceptance speech.

EX-KGB MAN PRIMAKOV `A KNOWN QUANTITY' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ US officials privately describe Boris N. Yeltsin's
latest choice for prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov, as the best of
a number of unappetizing choices. But they acknowledge too that he
has enough credibility with Western countries, free-market Russian
reformers, and ardent Communists to earn grudging respect from all
sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, he is the right man at the right time for this
job,'' said Edward Djerejian, a former US ambassador to Israel and
Syria, assistant secretary of State for Near East Affairs, and head
of the political section of the US embassy in Moscow from 1979 to
1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeltsin needs a prime minister who will be able to bridge the
reformers in Russia and the old guard,'' added Djerejian, who has
known Primakov for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Michael D. McCurry said the United States
expects a ``good and close'' relationship with Primakov, who is
expected to be confirmed quickly by the State Duma, Russia's lower
house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Djerijian's comments were more positive than those of US
officials familiar with Primakov, who did not want to be named.
``He's a known quantity and there are no surprises,'' said an
official who monitors Russia. ``That's part of the problem: There
are no surprises. He's not a reformer. He's a KGB Arab expert, with
a world view that doesn't necessarily match our own.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Primakov became chief of Russia's feared intelligence
service, the KGB, after years of diplomacy and espionage in the
Mideast. At the end of 1991, he moved to run its overseas
successor, the Foreign Intelligence Service. It was his extensive
experience as Russia's spymaster and his wary relationship with
Washington that gives him enough clout to deal with nationalists at
home, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   They remain far from enthusiastic about the Kremlin survivor,
whom they described as an ``old thinker'' steeped in KGB dogma.
Still, they consider Primakov to be the best candidate that
Washington could have hoped for, given that Russia's parliament
would not accept a reform-minded prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   And as foreign minister, Primakov has been willing to compromise
on some issues. He grudgingly acceded to the expansion of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization, for example. He also cooperated with
Americans on arms-control agreements considered vital by
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem, the specialists agreed, is that Primakov
has no economic training and has not demonstrated any innovative
ideas to deal with Russia's growing crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As Primakov emerged Thursday as the likely prime minister in
Moscow's game of musical chairs, the official emphasized the good
news: Most of the other contenders for the job were worse in the
administration's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest doubts about Primakov arose in early 1991, when he
traveled to Baghdad on behalf of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in
an unsuccessful attempt to avert the Gulf War. American officials
said that Primakov, who had extensive experience as a spy in the
region, was less of a mediator than an informal adviser to Saddam
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Still, since becoming acting foreign minister in 1996, Primakov
has worked closely with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
State Department spokesman James P. Rubin spoke of Primakov with
measured praise, calling him ``a worthy interlocutor on a number of
subjects ... and on several occasions a genuine partner.''

FEWER MINORITIES ENROLL IN SCIENCE COURSES, REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Enrollment in graduate science courses by students who are
members of minority groups, already so low that many educators
consider it a fundamental problem, has taken a steep dive, partly a
result apparently of shifting sentiment against affirmative-action
programs on US campuses.
</P>
<P>
   A report released Thursday by the American Association for the
Advancement of Science indicated that the number of blacks taking
first-year science and engineering graduate classes dropped 20
percent between 1996 and 1997, while the number of Hispanics fell
18.2 in that time. Those numbers had remained nearly constant for
blacks and had been rising for Hispanics during the previous three
years examined for the study, the first ever conducted on this
subject.
</P>
<P>
   The study's authors expressed strong concern that the one-year
decline represented the beginning of a longer-term, downward trend
for professions in which only about 6 percent of all jobs today are
held by ``underrepresented minorities.'' Those do not include
Asian-Americans, a disproportionate percentage of whom enter
science and engineering fields.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent to the University of California's 1996 decision to
abandon race-conscious recruitment, school officials a few months
ago reported a 24 percent drop in the number of blacks and a 5
percent drop in the number of Hispanics planning to enter the
nation's largest public college system.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's report, released in Washington and titled ``Losing
Ground,'' was cited by one of its authors as the first indication
that rollbacks of affirmative-action programs already are having a
ripple effect well beyond incoming freshmen at a single college
system. More broadly, it suggested that a ``tidal wave'' of court
decisions, congressional actions, and news media editorials had
reshaped the nation's climate into one in which educational
institutions no longer are certain about what they can do to help
minority students or to steer them into specific disciplines.
</P>
<P>
   One of the study's authors, Shirley Malcolm, said the result is
an ``unwelcoming atmosphere'' on many campuses for blacks and
Hispanics, especially in traditionally white fields. That augurs
poorly, she said, for minority participation in scientific
workplaces into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we are going to universities and to talk to the students
... they are saying to us, `There's a chill here. The uncertainty's
causing all sorts of problems,''' said Malcolm, director of the
AAAS Directorate for Education and Human Resources Programs.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she was certain about the role of affirmative action,
Malcolm said that some minorities probably decided to pursue jobs
in a strong economy rather than attend graduate school. But she
added: ``My main issue here is that the timing and the magnitude of
that drop is not accidental.''
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm, speaking by phone from Washington, echoed a central
recommendation of the report _ that the federal government should
set a clear national policy encouraging minority representation in
the sciences, and clarify what academic institutions are and are
not allowed to do to further that aim.
</P>
<P>
   As if on cue, though the timing of the two events apparently was
coincidental, President Clinton Thursday directed his National
Science and Technology Council to come up with recommendations
within three months on how to achieve greater diversity in
scientific and technological jobs.
</P>
<P>
   He made his announcement during a White House ceremony _
attended by Malcolm, among many others _ honoring the 1988
recipients of the Presidential Award for Excellence in Science,
Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring. It is largely to encourage
mentors and role models that educators believe more minorities
should be steered toward science careers.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Thursday's dual promotions of programs aimed at minorities
came just 24 hours after the release of a major new study that
argued the merits of affirmative action. Examining statistics for
45,000 students at 28 elite US colleges and universities, it
concluded that race-conscious policies had helped create the black
middle class and had promoted a positive view among whites of
integration.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis is contained in a book written by a former
president of Harvard, Derek Bok, and a former president of
Princeton, William Bowen. Its title is ``The Shape of the River:
Long-Term Consequences of Considering Race in College and
University Admissions.''
</P>
<P>
   Science educators seemed especially disappointed by the results
of the 1996-1997 study, released Thursday in Washington, because
they come after decades of private and governmental efforts _
involving tens of millions of dollars _ to move minorities into the
sciences. Women have also been the objects of these programs
because they represent only about 22 percent of employees in
science-related workplaces.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(can trim from here) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The AAAS report was based on surveys at 93 major research
universities. Its bottom-line findings were that:
</P>
<P>
   -- Black enrollment in natural sciences, computer sciences,
mathematics, and engineering stood at nearly 1,000 from 1994
through 1996 but fell to fewer than 800 in 1997. Black enrollment
in all science and engineering fields dropped to about 1,400 last
year, after hovering around 1,800 the previous three years.
</P>
<P>
   -- Hispanic enrollment rose slowly but steadily from about 800
in 1994 to nearly 1,000 in 1996 before plunging to fewer than 800
in 1997 in the natural sciences, computer sciences, mathematics,
and engineering. In all science and engineering fields, the number
dropped to just under 1,200 in 1997 after rising from almost 1,300
in 1994 to more than 1,400 in 1996.

 &HT;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Wearing a big button pleading ``Save Home Health
Care,'' Fran Slate drove from Colonial Heights, Va., to Capitol
Hill on Thursday to seek federal funds to care for ailing old folks
in their houses instead of nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   Dropping in on congressional offices, though, she found a
political community spellbound by suspense over Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr's massive report charging that President Clinton may
have committed impeachable offenses in covering up a sexual affair
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is so busy wondering what Bill has been doing in his
bedroom,'' Slate complained. ``They're so consumed with that.''
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the release of the report, scandal was practically
the only talk of the town. At the White House, Clinton apologized
to Senate Democrats and his cabinet for having misled them about
his involvement. At the federal courthouse, Starr's grand jury
continued its investigation, which could lead to indictments of
people close to the president. At the Justice Department, Attorney
General Janet Reno said: ``I think all America is concerned and
wants to see the matter resolved in the best interest of this
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   And on the Hill, the mantra began ``when we finally see the
report ...'' in fervid conversations from the marbled hallways to
basement cafeterias.
</P>
<P>
   Gossip about Starr's findings dominated conversations of
bureaucrats taking a smoking break outside the Ford Building, an
out-of-the-way office complex where the two copies of the 455-page
report and 34 other boxes containing two sets of supporting
evidence are being guarded in a locked room.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say they don't want to know the gory details. But
they're lying,'' said a committee staffer.
</P>
<P>
   The smokers marveled at the three camera crews set up across the
street and wondered at the logistics of releasing hundreds of
copies of the report to members of Congress and journalists on a
Friday afternoon. ``Maybe block off a side street and have a
drive-by delivery,'' was one suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., and John Conyers, D-Mich., are the
only two current House members who were on the Judiciary Committee
the last time something similar came up _ the Watergate scandal
when the panel voted to impeach then-President Nixon in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is so fluid now. No one knows what is in the
report that's going to have an impact on our decision,'' said
Rangel. ``Nixon was accused of manipulating federal agencies to
obstruct justice. The president is accused of having manipulated
people to obstruct justice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And the timetable is different. Now (with congressional
elections in eight weeks) we don't have the luxury of time on our
side,'' he said. ``Nor did we then have the partisanship on the
committee and in the House that we know exists now, regardless of
recent rhetoric...''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., began the day by
cautioning his colleagues to refrain from ``personal abuses and
ridicule'' in referring to the president in speeches on the chamber
floor. His warning was followed by one-minute speeches by two
members _ a Republican and a Democrat _ that were hardly flattering
to the current occupant of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.,
unintentionally provoked giggles in the press gallery when he said,
``You do not overturn an election of the American people on a whim
or because somebody has got a bad poll, in one sense or another.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the few Washingtonians sticking to a business-as-usual
routine was First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, who spoke about
colon cancer testing to 300 guests in the White House East Room but
never mentioned the embarrassing report about to be made public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sitting up in the Congress right now are proposals from this
administration that would substantially increase the amounts of
money they're spending on cancer research,'' she said. ``Let's pull
together. Let's make this crusade successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton accepted a long embrace from California Sen.
Barbara Boxer, who stroked the first lady's back and whispered in
her ear, the Associated Press reported. Earlier in the week, Boxer,
whose daughter is married to Mrs. Clinton's younger brother, joined
other Democrats who have publicly called the president's relations
with Lewinsky ``immoral.''
</P>
<P>
   At the federal courthouse, several blocks from where the Starr
report is being kept, grand jurors met again in a closed chamber.
But it was a slack day for the photographers and camera crews of
``Monica Beach'' _ the plaza where journalists have camped out for
eight months while chronicling the investigation. There were no
recognizable witnesses on Thursday.

$20 MILLION FUND TO SPUR EFFORT TO PERFECT DIABETES CURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Fla.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Juvenile Diabetes Foundation and a Florida financier pledged
$20 million Thursday to support Boston-based efforts to perfect a
promising but as yet rarely successful cure for the type of
diabetes that afflicts up to 2 million Americans, many of them
children.
</P>
<P>
   The money, to be given over five years, will support a new
center at Harvard Medical School teaming up 32 researchers, most of
them at Boston-area hospitals and research organizations, to
improve techniques for transplanting insulin-producing cells into
diabetics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's thrilling. It's probably the best thing that's happened
toward a cure for a long time,'' said Corie Osborn, 15, of Sudbury,
Mass., who was diagnosed with Type I diabetes four years ago and
attended the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Osborn must inject herself with insulin four to six times a day
and prick her finger for a blood sample every two hours she is
awake to monitor her blood sugar level.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Osborn, who plays field hockey and lacrosse, has been
healthy. But she fears she may begin to lose her eyesight and
kidney function if her condition worsens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very scary to think about the complications, but I'm
hoping that with centers like this, it will be cured before'' any
problems develop, Osborn said.
</P>
<P>
   The new center will focus on improving techniques for
transplanting islets of Langerhans _ the clusters of cells that
produce insulin _ into people with so-called Type I diabetes,
sometimes called juvenile-onset diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 5 to 15 percent of the country's 16 million
diabetics have Type I diabetes, in which the body's immune system
kills insulin-producing cells, thus requiring insulin injections.
The more common Type II diabetes occurs in older people and can
usually be controlled by diet and exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last three decades, an estimated 300 to 400 islets
transplants have been attempted, officials said. But often,
patient's immune systems kill the transplanted islets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results of that have been quite dismal,'' said the
center's director, Dr. Hugh Auchincloss, a top kidney and pancreas
transplant surgeon at the Massachusetts General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps five cases a year, the operations successfully allow
patients to stop injections, Auchincloss said. Another third or
more of recipients get at least some increased insulin production
that helps make it easier to manage the disease.
</P>
<P>
   But, said foundation scientific director Dr. Kevan Herold, who
has Type I diabetes himself: ``There are glimmers of hope from
various centers around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   By September 1999, center officials hope to begin transplant
tests with volunteer patients. Normally islets cells _ harvested
from pancreases of dead people who signed organ-donor cards or
grown in laboratories _ are injected into the patient's bloodstream
and settle in the liver, producing insulin.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the issues that center researchers will address are
improving treatments to prevent patients' immune systems from
attacking the transplanted islets and developing genetic or
pharmaceutical ways to make islets survive after transplants.
</P>
<P>
   West Palm Beach financier Lawrence J. DeGeorge, who last year
sold cable manufacturer Amphenol Corp. for $1.5 billion, and his
wife, Florence, have pledged $5 million for the project, with the
Juvenile Diabetes Foundation committing another $15 million.

deep question? Denzel Washington and Annette Bening also star.

`CHAMBERMAID' DROPS TITANIC BUT KEEPS ALL ITS CHARMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
Our rating: 3{ Stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This French production by Spanish director Bigas
Luna was called ``The Chambermaid on the Titanic'' until a few
weeks ago. It's anybody's guess why they dropped the title
reference to a certain 1912 disaster that you may have heard about,
but it's kind of a shame.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clueless kids who'll try anything with ``Titanic'' in
the title that are going to miss out. Rather, it's more
sophisticated viewers who would surely be tickled by the film's
(admittedly inadvertent) satire of James Cameron's behemoth but who
now may think this is just another movie about the life of a
domestic servant.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it's called, ``The Chambermaid'' is a droll jewel by
any standards. Intricate and multilayered yet surprisingly easy to
follow, it sets off like some kind of Emile Zola social tragedy but
gradually, persuasively evolves into an evermore outrageous comedy.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it's a sweet, heartfelt tribute to the
romantic impulse and how it can both threaten and save a troubled
marriage _ and how, when intermingled with the morbid fascination a
world-class calamity can generate, it can change the lives of those
clever enough to know how to exploit the public's fascination.
</P>
<P>
   Horty (Olivier Martinez), a young worker at a dreadful metal
foundry in a part of France where it has always just rained, wins a
company-sponsored endurance contest. The not-so-generous prize is a
single ticket to Southampton and a hotel reservation there, so he
can watch the mighty ocean liner start its maiden voyage.
</P>
<P>
   The foundry owner just wants Horty out of the way for a few days
so he can make a play for the poor worker's comely wife, Zoe
(Romane Bohringer). And no sooner has the naive Frenchman settled
into his English hotel room than the equally attractive Marie
(Aitana Sanchez-Gijon) knocks at his door. She claims to be
starting a job on the Titanic in the morning but has nowhere to
sleep that night, and could a fellow countryman put her up?
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear whether Horty accepts Marie's late-night
invitation to join her in bed. It's equally uncertain whether, upon
his return home, his growing suspicions about Zoe's faithfulness
are justified. Nevertheless, to drown his jealous sorrows, Horty
takes up semipermanent residence at the local pub, where he regales
his comrades (and cadges drinks) with outlandishly embellished
recollections of his passionate night with the Titanic maid.
</P>
<P>
   When Zoe gets wind of this, she's understandably miffed. Once
the ship goes down, adding a tragic dimension to the bawdy stories,
a traveling impresario hears about Horty's recitals and offers him
a lucrative road trip. Still bent out of shape, Zoe nonetheless
knows a good thing when she sees it. Soon, the bickering couple are
barnstorming the countryside, giving increasingly elaborate,
heart-tugging performances to bigger and better-paying audiences.
</P>
<P>
   And the sky's the limit, as long as no one finds out the truth.
But even then, this early-century Cameron story is so involving...
</P>
<P>
   Based on a novel by Didier Decoin, ``Chambermaid'' was in
production at the same time as ``Titanic,'' which makes its amusing
insights into why people are so susceptible to titillating hokum
even more astonishing. It would not be half as effective, though,
without its wry understanding of how fantasy and pragmatism can mix
up to impact a relationship mired in real-world concerns.
</P>
<P>
   It's also something of a different outing for Luna, whose
previous films such as ``Jamon Jamon'' and ``Golden Balls'' have
been vigorously vulgar travesties/celebrations of Spanish
sensuality and machismo. ``Chambermaid'' is a calmer, almost
classically presented affair.
</P>
<P>
   No less naughty, though, and probably his smartest film to date.

HOLGER JANNASCH, AT 71; SCIENTIST AT WOODS HOLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Holger W. Jannasch, a senior scientist at the Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution who was a lumberjack and fisherman before
becoming an expert on marine microbiology, died of cancer Tuesday
in his home in Woods Hole, Mass. He was 71.
</P>
<P>
   A seagoing scientist who often said, ``Science is an adventure,
not a career,'' Mr. Jannasch participated in more than 35
oceanographic cruises in the Atlantic, the Pacific, and the
Mediterranean and Black seas. He took part in expeditions to study
waterlife in Lake Kivu in Zaire in 1970 and participated in a joint
US-Chinese expedition that studied high-altitude Tibetan salt lakes
in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the staff at Woods Hole since 1963, his research
focused on microbial growth kinetics in seawater, the effects of
low temperature and high pressure on marine life, and the processes
of deep-sea hydrothermal vents, which were discovered in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, a chair at the Wood Hole Institution was named in his
honor. That same year, a microorganism, methanococcus jannaschii,
was also named in his honor.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Jannasch was born in Holzminden, Germany, in 1927. He was
drafted into the Germany military when he was 15, and briefly
imprisoned by the British at the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, he began to pursue his childhood dream of
becoming a forest ranger by first securing a job as a lumberjack.
He then became warden of a bird santuary on an island off the
German coast and a crew member on a fishing boat in the North Sea
before graduating from the University of Gottingen, where he later
earned a doctorate in biology.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Jannasch's interest in marine biology was awakened when, as
an undergraduate, he got a job at the university's zoological
institute labeling specimens of deep-sea mollusks from jars broken
during wartime bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Jannasch served on the editorial boards of several
scientific journals, including the Journal of Marine Research and
Applied and Environmental Microbiology, and edited several books,
including ``Advances in Aquatic Microbiology'' and ``Current
Perspectives in High Pressure Biology.''
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, Friederun (Goldschmidt); a son, Hans, of
Monterey, Calif; a brother, Niels, of Halifax, Nova Scotia; and two
grandsons.

ENCORES! SERIES DIRECTOR LEAVES WELL ENOUGH ALONG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Not long ago, Glenn Casale made a Manhattan
theater excursion to catch up on a few Broadway shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lion King''? He ``marveled'' at the technology and
director Julie Taymor's boundless creativity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Titanic''?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see the value in it,'' Casale says earnestly.
</P>
<P>
   OK, Glenn, how about ``Jekyll &AMP; Hyde,'' which a number of
critics found hollow and overbearing?
</P>
<P>
   ``I see why `Jekyll &AMP; Hyde' excites people, like a rock concert
does,'' Casale replies approvingly. ``The music and the voices
bleed together and overwhelm people.''
</P>
<P>
   By now you're probably getting the picture that Casale is a man
both of broad tastes and finely honed diplomatic skills. Or perhaps
it's just that, as the Toluca Lake resident puts it, ``I'm an easy
audience because I see the work that goes behind it.''
</P>
<P>
   Southern California audiences are getting used to seeing the
work behind Casale's own productions. An upstate New York native,
Casale has become one of the West Coast's most prolific and
well-regarded theater directors since migrating here in the early
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   For the next two weeks, he'll be helming ``The Threepenny
Opera,'' the latest offering in the Encores! series of staged
concert musicals, which opened Wednesday at UCLA's Freud Playhouse.
In between, he's been laying the groundwork for the Broadway
opening of ``Peter Pan,'' in a musically new production starring
Cathy Rigby, which recently played L.A.'s Pantages Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   A winner of several Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle awards for
directing, Casale's musical theater credits include ``Into the
Woods'' with Leslie Uggams, ``Fiddler on the Roof'' with Theodore
Bikel and ``Sweet Charity'' with Donna McKechnie. For ``Peter
Pan,'' he and Rigby opted for a slightly scarier version than usual
of the children's musical, sticking closely to the spirit of J.M.
Barrie's original book.
</P>
<P>
   While Casale explains that ``I tend to like darker shows,'' with
``Threepenny Opera'' he's making a point of keeping things light.
After all, the Kurt Weill-Bertolt Brecht ``musical'' satire about a
gang of cutthroats and beggars hardly needs sobering up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night, I was driving home from rehearsal and I thought,
`I've got to maintain the humor','' he says. ``Brecht's humor is so
important. You're so bound by the political nature of the piece
that you've got to have other things that diffuse the politics.
You've got to maintain the humor, you've got to maintain the
sexuality. Because this piece is all about urges.''
</P>
<P>
   Casale says he got the urge to do ``Threepenny'' after
discussing a list of possible shows with Marcia Seligson, producing
artistic director of Encores! Inspired by the highly successful
Encores! series at New York's City Center, Reprise! made its debut
in the spring of 1997 with ``Promises, Promises'' and also has
included ``Finian's Rainbow,'' ``Wonderful Town'' and ``The Pajama
Game.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, ``Threepenny'' is a surprising choice for the series,
which aims at restoring luster to the scores of musicals that are
seldom revived, usually because they have books that are
problematic and/or have aged badly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Threepenny,'' by contrast, is revived fairly often at regional
theaters, colleges and so on, though its last Broadway outing was a
critically lambasted 1989 production starring rock singer Sting. A
far more successful Joseph Papp production, starring Raul Julia as
Mack the Knife, ran for months on Broadway in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Casale says ``Threepenny'' will remind audiences that great
musicals needn't always be sweetness-and-light, boy-meets-girl
affairs _ as the recent ``Chicago'' revival, developed through the
Encores! series, aptly demonstrated.
</P>
<P>
   He also believes the show offers a textbook opportunity for
strong ensemble acting. To that end, he's assembled an impeccably
credentialed cast _ Bikel, Ken Page, Rachel York, Carrie Hamilton,
Jonelle Allen, among others _ without any major TV or film stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked for actors who were aggressive in their acting
choices,'' Casale says. ``I really believe in the actors'
creativity, when you allow them to be creative without judgment. I
believe that in whatever I do, even if I'm doing `Fiddler,' if you
don't have an ensemble, I don't care who your stars are, you don't
have a play.''
</P>
<P>
   Known both as a thorough and a pleasant taskmaster, Casale has
all his actors write biographies of their characters, no matter how
large or small their parts. Beggars, for instance, had to decide
how long they'd been with the Peachums and how they'd lost their
various arms and legs.
</P>
<P>
   Casale even asked one woman to consider whether her character's
amputated leg was real or a put-on. After a dinner break, she
decided her character was faking it. So now, after hobbling around
in Act 1, she mysteriously sheds her injury in Act 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that will be a fun moment,'' Casale says.

HOLE OFFERS NO MORE THAN REFRIED BEANS

HOLE/``Celebrity Skin'' (Geffen)
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bet you thought the Go-Go's were just a bad memory. Guess again.
The '80s new-wave girl group, plus Echo &AMP; the Bunnymen and other
well-coifed shadows from MTV's skinny-tie past, is just one of many
points of retro-reference for actress-model-whatever Courtney Love
and company in Hole's latest effort, which kicks off with a soaring
pop-metal riff and the self-referential plea, ``Oh, make me over.''
Love, as usual, is best addressing her own myth, which she does
throughout this only occasionally satisfying album. Unfortunately,
``Celebrity Skin'' never quite matches the heights of Hole's
previous disc, ``Live Through This,'' which boasted material far
superior to such tepid fare as ``Malibu'' (naturally including a
cameo from Belinda Carlisle of the Go-Go's) and ``Playing Your
Song.'' And for all the commotion surrounding old flame Billy
Pumpkin's contributions to a handful of tracks, it doesn't really
add up to much more than a heap of refried cool beans. 2 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
LOS SUPER SEVEN/``Los Super Seven'' (RCA)
</P>
<P>
   This is a Mex-American supergroup: David Hildago and Cesar Rosas
(Los Lobos), conjunto king Flaco Jimenez, fellow Texas Tornado
Freddy Fender, Texas stalwart Joe Ely and others performing mostly
trad tunes. Only two of the 13 songs were written in the '90s, but
they've been arranged and updated, and now cool like a plate of
ceviche and warm like a shot of reposado. Selected for their
resonance with the performers, here are songs of desire, adulation
and reclamation that bob and weave, trot and gallop. At under 45
minutes, though, the album is not up to contemporary standards in
length. But this music was in your 'hood long before you were, and
instead of closing the window, give it a good listen. 3 Stars. &QL; 
_ James Hames &QR; 
 &QL; 
JENNIFER KIMBALL/``Veering From the Wave'' (Imaginary Road)
</P>
<P>
   Kimball left her musical partner Jonatha Brooke and the group
they formed together called the Story four years ago. On her first
solo effort, Kimball affirms it was her vocal prowess that gave the
duo its harmonic lift. Brooke was the primary songwriter then, but
Kimball expresses herself here with lamentations of ache and
jeremiads of loss, with a speck of hope on the side. The hooky
``Kissing in the Car'' has already made the KPCC-FM (89.3)
playlist. Another goodie, ``(This is) My New Vow,'' hauntingly
documents a broken marriage. ``Gagna's Song'' features Robert
Fripp-inspired guitar work. In weighing the Brooke-less Kimball and
the Kimball-less Brooke, you realize each without the other has its
positive points. They share musicians, and have offered thanks to
each other in liner notes, but still (nostalgia for the Story
aside) each is only a little better than half as good. Kimball
plays the Troubadour on Sept. 26. 2 Stars.

CLINTON'S POLL RATINGS START TO SAG A LITTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pointing to a diagram showing that most Americans
think the country is on ``the right track,'' Mark Penn, the
president's pollster, Thursday sought to reassure a gathering of
Democratic donors by inundating them with survey data.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were coming from another planet and didn't read the
newspaper,'' Penn said, ``you would think the Democrats were in an
absolutely tremendous position.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as the Monica Lewinsky scandal envelops President
Clinton, his advisers and supporters cling to their own polls and
public surveys showing that the president's job approval rating
remains impressive and that there are no statistical indications
that Democratic candidates are being dragged down.
</P>
<P>
   But surveys released Thursday by CBS News and ABC News offered
hints that, though far from definitive, suggest that Clinton's
support might be softening _ and that there is increased public
concern about the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, most polls show that Clinton's job approval ratings
remain steady. In the CBS News survey, his rating stands at 59
percent, the first time it has slipped below 60 percent since the
Lewinsky issue unfolded in January. In August, Clinton's job
approval was 65. Still, the shift is barely significant,
statistically, because the margin of sampling error in the poll is
plus or minus 4 percentage points. In addition, even a 59 percent
rating is impressive because many pollsters argue that anything
over 50 percent is comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Frankovic, director of surveys at CBS News, described
the job approval numbers as a ``mild weakening'' in the president's
support. ``It's important to note that the psychological barrier of
the 60-percent approval rating has been broken for the first
time,'' she said. ``But I'm not sure it portends additional
dropping.''
</P>
<P>
   The CBS survey of 738 adults nationwide, conducted Tuesday and
Wednesday nights, found that 36 percent of the respondents think
Clinton has less honesty and integrity than most people in public
life, a slight increase from last month. And 71 percent said the
scandal will have a serious impact on Clinton's administration over
the next two years, an 11-point increase since August.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the poll also found that people continue to trust Clinton as
a leader. Sixty-three percent said he had strong qualities of
leadership; 73 percent approve of his handling of the economy and
62 percent approve of his handling of foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   The survey by ABC News, conducted Wednesday night, also found
slight signs of erosion in Clinton's job approval rating, which
stands at 57 percent, down from 66 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
   But as in the CBS News survey, people seem to separate the
president's conduct from his personal performance. While only 28
percent said they trusted Clinton on a personal level, 58 percent
said they trusted him to handle the nation's business. The poll of
509 adults nationwide has a margin of sampling error of plus or
minus 5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Another survey released Thursday, conducted by the Pew Research
Center for The People and the Press, found that voters say
Clinton's troubles would not be much of a factor in their voting
for Congress. It found that voters are divided in their support for
Democratic and Republican congressional candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found an improvement in the public perception of
the Republican Party; 56 percent hold a favorable opinion of the
party, up from 47 percent in August. There was no shift in the
public's view of Democrats; 60 percent said they rated the party
favorably. The survey of 2,266 adult nationwide was conducted from
Aug. 27 to Sept. 8 and had a margin of sampling error of plus or
minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on how Clinton's ratings remain relatively firm,
Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Center, said, ``This is a
shock-proof public, so far. People really want the good times to
remain. This is a very, very powerful notion that's not easily
moved.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Penn and Democratic Party officials emphasized the mostly
encouraging poll results in their addresses at a Washington
conference of the Democratic Business Council, a group of the
party's donors from business and labor, as evidence that the party
could survive the Lewinsky scandal on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   After citing his own surveys showing that there ``is absolutely
no evidence'' that Clinton's general support was slipping, Penn
said he contacted several other Democratic pollsters this week,
asking if they had detected an erosion in support for the party. He
said they had not.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is not on the ticket; that issue is not on the
ticket,'' said Colorado Gov. Roy Romer, the general chairman of the
Democratic Party. ``Is this going to dampen Democrats coming out to
vote? Not on your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Jill Alper, the party's political director, said, ``We are
prepared to run a ruthlessly efficient campaign designed to talk to
base voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet beneath the bravado, some Democrats spoke frankly about
Clinton. ``If you want to look at a guy who's had a harpoon hook in
the middle of his gut,'' Romer said in an interview. ``He's gone
through hell.''
</P>
<P>
   And at one session, an audience member rose from his seat and
scolded party officials for what he described as ``defeatist
talk.'' He said, ``That's nonsense. We're going to talk ourselves
into it. I don't even want to hear this defeatist talk.'' The
audience burst into applause.

FERRARO BEHIND IN POLLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With a few days to go before the Democratic primary,
Geraldine Ferraro _ once a seeming shoo-in to become the party's US
Senate candidate _ is suddenly trailing badly in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   A last-minute stumble has also turned the governor's primary
topsy-turvy, with Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross _ another
front-runner coasting on name recognition _ falling to third place.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro made history 14 years ago as the first woman to be
nominated for vice president, and has built a strong media presence
since, most recently as co-host of CNN's ``Crossfire.'' But her
Senate campaign has gone downhill from the moment she announced it
last January _ and she now appears to have fallen behind her main
rival, US Representative Charles Schumer, by a stunning 16-point
margin.
</P>
<P>
   In a poll of 710 likely primary voters, taken Monday and Tuesday
and reported in Thursday's New York Post, Schumer won 40 percent of
the vote, Ferraro 24 percent, and New York City's public advocate
Mark Green 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves 22 percent undecided, and the poll's margin of error
is 5.7 percentage points, giving Ferraro's camp room for some hope.
The primary takes place this Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it signals a huge decline for Ferraro from just a week
earlier, when the Post poll put her ahead by 8 points.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro spokesman Steve Gaskill sees the drop as more the sign
of a suspect poll. ``How can there be such a difference in just one
week?'' Gaskill said Thursday. ``This is just not credible.''
</P>
<P>
   The pollster, John Zogby, acknowledged Thursday that such a
rapid slide ``is unusual,'' but said, ``A lot of Ferraro's support
has always been soft, and now, as people start to pay attention to
the race, much of it's shifting to Schumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic consultant who is not working for
any candidate in this race, attributed Ferraro's decline mainly to
money. Schumer has a lot of it, and has used it well and early;
Ferraro has little, and has used it too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schumer's had ads on TV for the last six months,'' Sheinkopf
noted. ``Gerry's just been up the last week.''
</P>
<P>
   Zogby thinks the substance of the ads also gives Schumer an
edge. ``Voters want to know, `What have you done for me lately?'''
Zogby said. ``Schumer's spots answer that question: `I legislate,
and here's what I've legislated.' Ferraro's ads say, 'You know me,
I ran for vice president _ parenthesis, 14 years ago.'''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer has raised over $8 million. Ferraro, who had vowed to
raise $5 million, has mustered less than $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Sheinkopf expected Ferraro to raise lots of money,
noting that she was the Democratic Party's number one female
candidate, running against _ in Alfonse D'Amato, the incumbent
Republican senator _ its number one target.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ultimate question,'' Sheinkopf continued, ``is who turns
out.'' If turnout is light, as many expect it to be, this, too, may
work in Schumer's favor, as he has more support from Democratic
party organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The implosion of Betsy McCaughey Ross's campaign for governor is
due even more to a lack of money and ideas. Her wealthy husband,
Wilbur Ross, had given her nearly $3 million, but withdrew it last
week, leaving her with virtually nothing. This week, she
acknowledged that the marriage is in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats also distrust her, since, until a year ago, she
was not only a Republican, but Republican Governor George Pataki's
running-mate. She switched parties and declared war on her former
boss, mainly because he was ignoring her ideas and belittling her
personally.
</P>
<P>
   She never had much chance of beating Pataki _ Zogby's polls show
him with over 60 percent of the vote in November's general
election, no matter which Democrat wins the primary _ but her
effort might have launched a political career, which now seems
about to capsize.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's Post poll gave Peter Vallone, the New York City
Council speaker, 38 percent of the vote, and McCaughey Ross 12
percent, trailing by fraction of a point Charles Hynes, the
Brooklyn district attorney.

 Dead Politicians Don't Tell Lies  
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Clinton scandal is just the latest sign that our American
system of government is in serious trouble, but I think the good
people of Oklahoma City may have come up with a solution.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahomans recently gave 21 percent of their votes to a dead
woman, forcing a runoff to determine the Democratic nominee for a
U.S. Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   According to The Associated Press, Jacquelyn Morrow Lewis died
of a heart attack at age 69 on July 15, too close to the election
to have her name removed from the ballot. She received 21 percent
of the vote in a field of four, finishing second behind an air
conditioner contractor who got 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evidently the voters have spoken,'' said Jerry Kobyluk, a
rancher who fell short by 2,000 votes to Mrs. Ledgerwood. ``I'm not
complaining. I'm just wondering what voters were thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time that Oklahomans have cast their
ballots for a dead person. In 1990, a dead judge got 91 percent of
the vote, prompting the governor to appoint someone (presumably
alive) to fill the post.
</P>
<P>
   Cynics have suggested several possible reasons for Lewis's
strong showing at the polls. One theory is that voters liked her
because she is a woman (although a dead one), another is that
voters pulled the lever for Lewis because she had the longest name,
while a third theory (and the most plausible one) suggests a
Republican conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   I prefer to think that Oklahoma voters knew exactly what they
were doing as there are some very good reasons for voting for a
candidate who is technically dead.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, dead elected officials are considerably less
likely to get involved in a scandal than their live counterparts.
The whole Lewinsky thing might have been avoided if Clinton were
dead, though our president's hormones being what they are, one can
not be entirely sure.
</P>
<P>
   Being dead does not necessarily preclude a leader from running
his or her country. Take Boris Yeltsin, for instance. My sources
tell me that Yeltsin has been dead for years and that his few
public appearances since then have been nothing more than cheap,
Russian-made holographic projections. While it is true that the
whole Russian economy seems to be going down the toilet, it would
be unfair to blame it all on poor dead Boris as there is no
guarantee that a live president would have done any better.
</P>
<P>
   Dead politicians do not solicit illegal campaign contributions,
invite people to spend the night in the Lincoln bedroom or admit on
national TV that they were guilty of an ``inappropriate
relationship.'' Also, when a dead politician says he did not
inhale, you can believe him.
</P>
<P>
   Dead politicians do not waffle on the issues, fudge, backtrack
or issue ``inoperative'' statements. They cannot break their
campaign promises because they never made any campaign promises to
begin with.
</P>
<P>
   Dead politicians can not be influenced by lobbyists or other
special interest groups, which means these people would have to
find work in other fields, such as washing windshields at busy
intersections or selling Princess Diana memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   Dead politicians are nothing if not consistent and trustworthy,
which means their approval rating in the polls should remain
exactly the same throughout their administration. This would be
good news for the stock markets, which fluctuate dramatically in
response to (live) politicians' behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, there would be no skeleton in a dead politician's
closet; it would be out there for all the world to see.

DECEPTION IN HIGH AND LOW PLACES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sex, lies and videotapes could be the topic of
this column every week, but with the release this week of ``Primary
Colors'' and ``Wild Things,'' it is even more apropos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colors'' is Mike Nichols' film of Joe Klein's novel that is a
fictional account of President Clinton's campaign for the White
House in 1992. The film is flawed in a number of ways, veering into
melodrama at times to elicit emotional response and too often
opting for glibness rather than striving for real insights.
Nevertheless, ``Colors'' raises questions about character and
idealism vs. Realpolitik that go to the heart of the current
scandal in Washington. Now with Kenneth Starr's report on the
Monica Lewinsky matter about to hit and continued talk of
impeachment on Capitol Hill, ``Colors,'' like the timely ``Wag the
Dog,'' should be a popular rental at the video store.
</P>
<P>
   It is important to note that ``Colors'' is fiction, though the
parallels between southern Gov. Jack Stanton (John Travolta) and
his wife, Susan (Emma Thompson), and Bill and Hillary Clinton are
undeniable. There is even a scene where the penitent candidate and
his wife go on a talk show to discuss his infidelity. There are
other similarities. Richard Jemmons, the redneck spin doctor (Billy
Bob Thornton), is obviously James Carville. Libby Holden (Kathy
Bates), the manic ``dust buster'' who tries to cover up Stanton's
scandals before they hit the front pages, is similar to Betsey
Wright, Clinton's chief of staff when he was governor. Lawrence
Harris (Kevin Cooney), the New England senator who is Stanton's
primary opposition until suffering a heart attack, is like the
physically frail Paul Tsongas, the late senator from Massachusetts
who was an early rival of Clinton's. Cashmere McLeod (Gia Carides),
who accuses Stanton of having an affair with her, is a stand-in for
Gennifer Flowers.
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, differences, but some plot points take on
a life of their own in light of the recent scandal. The filmmakers
must have thought having Stanton's being accused of impregnating
the family's 17-year-old baby sitter and then covering up the
potential scandal in a slimy way would strike audiences as
outrageous. But by the time the film came out _ two months after
the affair with the 21-year-old Lewinsky broke _ it must have
seemed at least plausible. Remember then, Clinton was still denying
the affair and had many vocal supporters. Now, with Clinton's mea
culpa and backers disillusioned, it's almost prescient.
</P>
<P>
   Part of what ``Colors'' is about is the cult of personality, and
having a charismatic movie star like Travolta play Stanton works
especially well. Stanton is a figure who people want to be around,
whose personality thrills them. Clinton is said to have the same
effect. An acquaintance of mine was once introduced to Clinton.
Although he has worked with and been around some of the biggest
names in Hollywood, he said that he was incredibly moved during the
meeting, swept up by the president's personality.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, we never get a handle on Stanton's character.
Travolta's take may seem like a mere impersonation of the ``I feel
your pain'' Clinton, but it goes to what the film is about. The
fuzzy Stanton is sort of a Rorschach test. Idealists see his
ideals, others his slickness, others humanity, others his
deviousness. The same might be said for the way voters look at
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever your feelings toward the president, though, ``Colors''
is entertaining enough _ with some smart performances, especially
from Oscar winner Bates _ to make it worth renting. And it may even
trigger some interesting discussions.
</P>
<P>
   A `WILD' RIDE: Politics plays no part in ``Wild Things,'' but
lies and sex do. ``Scream'' queen Neve Campbell stars as Suzie, a
stoned-out high-school student in this campy, twisted comic film
noir. The intricately plotted thriller revolves around a
high-school guidance counselor (Matt Dillon) in a steamy Florida
town who is accused by one of his students (Denise Richards) of
raping her. The police at first refuse to arrest him because there
is no physical evidence, but then Suzie steps forward to spin the
same tale. Lombardo is then arrested. After losing his job, the
only lawyer he can afford is a lowlife played by Bill Murray who
works out of a storefront and wears wrinkled polyester suits and an
insurance-scam neck brace.
</P>
<P>
   This is just the beginning of the film's wild twists and turns,
which don't end until the final scene. And in case you're confused,
the denouement, which explains the whole elaborate plot, is
interspersed with the credits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wild Things'' is sort of like a B movie you used to see at the
drive-in, with utterly gratuitous sex and violence. But don't
dismiss it or take it too seriously. Director John McNaughton is
clever playing with the genre, and ``Wild Things'' is so much fun
you may wish there was still a drive-in around to go to.

MEET THE DEAANS OF THE SWING SCENE
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; When hair bands were all the rage on the Sunset
Strip in the late '80s, the members of Royal Crown Revue were
playing swing music and dressing in '40s double-breasted zoot
suits.
</P>
<P>
   Their work paid off. Several neo-swing outfits, including the
Brian Setzer Orchestra and Cherry Poppin' Daddies, are all over the
charts these days. Royal Crown Revue's new release, ``The
Contender'' (Warner Bros.), recently entered the nation's top 200.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never had a clue the sound would take off the way it has,''
said trumpeter Scott Steen, 31, of Pasadena. ``We started
originally as a rockabilly group, and then a tenor sax player
joined, and that changed the sound. We were always a do-it-yourself
band. Setzer would come to our shows.''
</P>
<P>
   The seven-member Royal Crown Revue appears Sept. 20 during
Doheny Days at Doheny State Beach in Dana Point, Sept. 22 at the
Ventura Theatre and Sept. 30 at the Palace in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Steen said he noticed the swing sound catching on when the band
would take to the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to go to San Francisco and play these little clubs,
and there was this tiny but strong scene,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Royal Crown Revue, Steen plays in the Jazz Jury,
which scored music for the cult film ``Swingers.'' The Jazz Jury
appears Tuesday at the Derby in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   NEW DISCS ON TAP: On Sept. 29, Outpost Recordings will release
``Faithless Street,'' the album Raleigh, N.C., country-rockers
Whiskeytown issued on an indie label in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-song reissue boasts new artwork and nine bonus tracks
available for the first time. No Depression magazine, which covers
the alt-country scene, said ``Faithless Street'' wasn't just one of
the finest debut discs of the year or one of the finest alt-country
albums of the year, ``it was one of the best records of the year
period.''
</P>
<P>
   In other new releases, the debut album from free-wheeling
British band Gomez was issued this week. The album is up for
Britain's prestigious Mercury Music Prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to focus on the traditional elements _ melodies and
arrangements _ but the arrangements are skewed and subverted,''
said singer-guitarist-keyboardist Tom Gray. ``It's not really
planned out; we just do what sounds good to our warped ears.''
</P>
<P>
   BEATLES REDUX: New from Schirmer Books' classic rock albums
series is ``Abbey Road/Let It Be/The Beatles'' (Peter Doggett;
$14.95), which discusses how the Fab Four recorded those three
records.

A TOUGH ACT TO FOLLOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There must be a reason _ aside from the usual lack
of originality _ why two animated ant movies are coming out this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the close arrivals of ``Antz'' and ``A Bug's Life''
represent the fact that there are so many releases scheduled
between now and the end of the year that distinguishing particular
films from the pack is going to be like picking out individual
pests at a picnic.
</P>
<P>
   Or it could be a subtle indication that most of the late '98
offerings will be marked by a certain dronelike sameness. After
all, with such atypically distinctive summer fare as ``Saving
Private Ryan,'' ``There's Something About Mary'' and ``The Truman
Show'' still resonating through the pop culture, just how many more
standout ideas can we reasonably expect Hollywood to come up with?
</P>
<P>
   Then again, it could just be movie marketeers' clever way of
indicating that they really want to bug us this season.
</P>
<P>
   While doubling is a notable phenomenon among the year-end
prospects _ besides the insect cartoons, there are two
heart-tuggers about growth-impaired kids (``Simon Birch'' and ``The
Mighty''), dueling Meryl Streep showcases (``One True Thing'' and
``Dancing at Lughnasa'') and a mini-James Jones revival (Terrence
Malick's star-studded film version of Jones' World War II novel
``The Thin Red Line'' and Merchant-Ivory's adaptation of his
offspring's fictionalized memoir ``A Soldier's Daughter Never
Cries'') _ the fall's most interesting film trend is controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Or, at least, the potential for it.
</P>
<P>
   While most distributors hate taking heat for provocative or
upsetting pictures, in this overcrowded season it may be the best
way to distinguish their product from the rest of the pack.
</P>
<P>
   For example, three October releases that address the always
alarming subject of Nazism come with their own extra issues. The
hype-artist/director of the reportedly great skinhead saga
``American History X'' is very vocally disowning the film. Some
underage extras in ``Apt Pupil,'' a Stephen King story about a war
criminal hiding out in an American high school, have claimed that
they were inappropriately asked to do a nude shower scene. And
Roberto Benigni's Italian comedy ``Life Is Beautiful'' unfolds in
the decidedly unfunny setting of a World War II concentration camp.
</P>
<P>
   Internment camps make an unwelcome reappearance, too, in ``The
Siege,'' a political thriller in which Arab-Americans and Muslims
are rounded up in response to a wave of terrorism. Arab-American
and Muslim groups have already responded to the film's promotional
campaign with organized protests.
</P>
<P>
   Other religious groups may have their own complaints about the
comedy ``Holy Man,'' in which Eddie Murphy plays a guru who shills
for a TV shopping network; ``What Dreams May Come,'' the Robin
Williams afterlife fantasy with decidedly nontraditional visions of
heaven and hell; and ``Orgazmo,'' the story of a Mormon porno star.
</P>
<P>
   That one may seem comparatively wholesome when stacked up
against the pedophilia-themed ``Lolita'' remake and ``Happiness,''
a Cannes Film Festival favorite that was nonetheless deemed too
deviant for its original American distributor to release. And at
least two black comedies, ``Clay Pigeons'' and ``Very Bad Things,''
display an unhealthy interest in violence against women _ as,
unavoidably, will the remake of ``Psycho.'' That one's very
existence may make it the most controversial film of the year _
among classic film lovers, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there may be so many troublesome movies this fall
that they cancel each other out _ or, more likely, scare off
audiences completely. Perhaps DreamWorks was right to go way in the
other direction. The studio solicited input from representatives of
numerous religious and ethnic groups to make sure that their
animated Moses spectacular, ``The Prince of Egypt,'' offends
nobody.
</P>
<P>
   Others are hoping that, since fall-style daring movies did so
well this summer, maybe summer-type action entertainments will
catch on now. Chris Tucker teams up with Jackie Chan for the demo
derby ``Rush Hour.'' In ``Ronin,'' Robert De Niro tears up so many
French roads they should've called it ``The American Connection.''
You've already seen the trailers of Will Smith disrupting traffic
as the wrongly accused ``Enemy of the State.'' No word about
vehicular mayhem in the Kurt Russell sci-fi feature ``Soldier,''
but it does take place on a junkyard planet.
</P>
<P>
   On a more traditional note, the Halloween season will be tricked
up with such back-from-the-dead horror genre titles as ``Urban
Legend,'' ``John Carpenter's Vampires,'' ``I Still Know What You
Did Last Summer,'' ``The Faculty'' and _ yikes _ ``Bride of
Chucky.'' This being the supposedly cerebral season as well,
mortality and mysticism might get more serious consideration in the
likes of ``What Dreams,'' ``Jack Frost,'' the Anthony Hopkins-Brad
Pitt ``Meet Joe Black,'' the Sandra Bullock-Nicole Kidman
``Practical Magic'' and the Oprah Winfrey-powered ``Beloved,''
based on Toni Morrison's acclaimed novel.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of acclaim, the traditional Oscar-contention time is
surprisingly light on big-name directors this year. Aside from
``Beloved's'' Jonathan Demme (``Silence of the Lambs''),
``Soldier's Daughter's'' James Ivory (``Howards End'') and the
perennial Woody Allen, it's a pretty thin auteurist line.
</P>
<P>
   Fronted, of course, by ``Red Line's'' Malick (who hasn't made a
movie in 20 years), ``Road Warrior'' stylist George Miller (whose
entry is the sequel to the talking-pig movie ``Babe'') and Gus Van
Sant, who had ``Good Will Hunting'' last year but will need all the
abundant good will Hollywood is famous for to snatch a nomination
for ``Psycho.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Spielberg, start polishing your acceptance speech.

ANOTHER RUN FOR BOX-OFFICE BUCKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 2{ Stars 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Without Limits'' is the second disappointing
movie made about track star Steve Prefontaine to arrive in theaters
in the past two years. With a subject as interesting as
Prefontaine, I'm tempted to say that the third time would be the
charm, but I doubt that studios will see it that way. After these
two false starts (Disney's little-seen ``Pre'' being the other
film), chances are Prefontaine will be disqualified from any future
biopic competitions.
</P>
<P>
   Prefontaine isn't widely known to the general public, mostly
because he never won a medal in the Olympics, track's most visible
spectacle of competition. During his career as an amateur athlete,
though, he held most distance records between 2,000 and 10,000
meters and never lost a race in the United States. On top of that,
Prefontaine was handsome, charismatic and had a rock star's touch
when it came to working a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Acclaimed screenwriter Robert Towne (``Chinatown'') has spent
several years working on this film, directing it as well as
co-writing the screenplay with Sports Illustrated journalist and
former champion runner Kenny Moore. It's disappointing, then, that
``Without Limits'' adheres so conventionally to the cliches of the
jock movie genre and provides only the briefest of glimpses into
the psyche of the track star it means to celebrate. Towne shows us
the events that made Prefontaine famous but misses the opportunity
to explain the circumstances that molded him into the
single-minded, gutsy athlete he became.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Limits,'' like countless other sports movies before
it, follows a familiar trajectory. We meet Prefontaine (Billy
Crudup) as a successful high school runner who is highly coveted by
every university possessing a top track and field program.
</P>
<P>
   Pre, however, has his mind set on going to the University of
Oregon so he can compete for the school's larger-than-life track
coach Bill Bowerman (Donald Sutherland). We know Bowerman's a good
coach, if for no other reason than he sports the same kind of hats
that Tom Landry and Bear Bryant wore on the sidelines. That and the
fact that he's a poet when it comes time to give a pep talk, not to
mention that he invented the first Nike running shoe.
</P>
<P>
   Once Pre hits college, he inevitably clashes with the
strong-willed Bowerman, who wants his charge to pace himself during
races, believing that's the way to faster times. Pre will have none
of it. He has always run out front _ any other way is
``chicken----,'' he says. The movie attempts to provide some
psychological justification for this belief through some awkward
childhood footrace flashbacks, but we never do learn much about why
Prefontaine does this _ or anything else.
</P>
<P>
   So Pre wins, then wins big and then inevitably loses and faces a
Moment of Truth, where he can either quit or do what it takes to
get back and be all that he can be. There are such time-honored
devices as The Pep Talk and The Reluctant Girlfriend. And whenever
Towne isn't sure we understand just how great his subject is, he
has the network announcers explain the legend for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Limits'' certainly has its merits. Prefontaine's life
is inherently interesting, and Towne manages some interesting notes
with the relationship between Pre and Bowerman. The races
themselves crackle with electricity, particularly Prefontaine's
justly famous contest at the 1972 Munich Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   But time and time again the film settles for the expected
instead of trying anything engaging or new. There were some
half-dozen times where I heard a character say a line and knew
exactly what the piece of dialogue would be. One example came
during an anguished confrontation between Pre and his coach over
whether he should run a race with an injured foot.
</P>
<P>
   Bowerman: You don't know what it will do to your foot if you try
to run.
</P>
<P>
   Pre: You don't know what it will do to my foot if I do run, but
you DO know what it'll do to me if I don't.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen Nike commercials with better exchanges. And that's too
bad, because there's a good movie to be made about the life of
Steve Prefontaine. Sadly, I don't think we're ever going to see it.

OBUCHI SUGGESTS JAPAN MAY LAUNCH RECONNAISSANCE SATELLITE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said Thursday that Japan
might launch its own reconnaissance satellite, a move that would
improve the country's military capacity and make it easier to
monitor missile deployments in North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Such a move would cause deep unease in neighboring countries. It
would add to the perception that Japan is running circles around
its ``peace constitution'' and quietly constructing the building
blocks for a powerful modern army.
</P>
<P>
   These days, however, many Japanese are much less concerned with
the apprehensions of neighboring countries and more focused on
their own nervousness after North Korea's recent launch of a
ballistic missile. The missile, which on Aug. 31 sailed over Japan
to land in the Pacific Ocean, indicated that North Korea could
attack any city in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi said he wanted a better warning system in case North
Korea launches other missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``One possibility is launching our own satellite,'' he said.
``We have instructed ministries and agencies to study what we would
be able to launch and what functions it would be able to perform.''
</P>
<P>
   North Korea says it launched the multi-stage rocket to put a
satellite into orbit, but with the exception of one Russian
scientist, no expert seems to have so far detected a satellite. It
is considered possible that North Korea tried to launch a satellite
as part of a missile test but that the satellite malfunctioned.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has always been apprehensive of North Korea, which is seen
here as unpredictable and deeply threatening. A best-selling
suspense novel now in Japanese bookstores, ``Declaration of War,''
tells a harrowing tale of North Korean submarines launching an
attack on Japanese nuclear power plants.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, there were periodic suggestions that Japan should
have its own satellite, but these have grown into a loud chorus
since North Korea launched the missile. Hiromu Nonaka, the chief
government spokesman, said Japanese officials had been deeply upset
at feeling entirely reliant on other countries for information
about a missile that had flown over its own territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt powerless as we strove for our security based on only
occasional information provided to us,'' Nonaka said.
</P>
<P>
   The main opposition leader, Naoto Kan, also endorsed the idea
that Japan should launch a satellite. Similarly, a task force in
the ruling Liberal Democratic Party has already begun summoning
government officials and private-sector space experts to figure out
the next step.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is no doubt that Obuchi and other officials have
a spy satellite in mind, they are speaking of a ``multi-purpose''
satellite that could also monitor weather and natural disasters.
One reason for the euphemism is to avoid provoking the neighbors,
and another is the desire not to violate a 1969 parliamentary
resolution specifying that Japan should use space only for peaceful
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Japan tends to see itself as the most peaceful of nations, but
China and the two Koreas see it very differently _ through grim
memories of war and occupation earlier in this century _ and they
have been concerned by a series of developments that are giving
Japan increasing military options.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has turned to a kind of nuclear power station that
requires plutonium, giving it the raw materials to make nuclear
weapons very quickly if it ever chooses to. At an expense of more
than $2 billion, Japan has also developed the H-2 rocket, which is
intended to launch satellites but could be converted into an
intercontinental ballistic missile.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   All these only create options, and Japanese public opinion seems
firmly against rapid rearmament. A recent poll by Gallup Japan
found that 89 percent of the public believes that Japan does not
need to build nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials are not enthusiastic about the spending of
billions of dollars by Japan on its own satellite intelligence
system. One reason may be that the satellite would give Japan a
measure of independence from Washington in intelligence-gathering
in the region, and another is that Tokyo might put its resources
into the satellite rather than into the theater missile defense
system that the United States favors.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Japanese government official suggested that Tokyo is
concerned about how the United States will react to the idea of a
Japanese satellite, but he noted that financially the satellite
project would probably be a good deal for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. would be better off if Japan got a satellite, because
American companies would get a lot out of the deal,'' he said.

   IMPEACH-MARKET (Los Angeles) _ First Asia, then Russia and Latin
America. Now, a possible impeachment of the president of the United
States. If Thursday is any indication, the market abhors political
turmoil in the White House. In midday trading, the Dow is down by
249 points, a day after leaks about the Starr report point to
serious trouble for Clinton. By Deborah Adamson. (Will move in the

$200 million in sales in its first week on store shelves and $8.5
million in rental revenue to go along with domestic box office of
$600.7 million, foreign box office of $1.2 billion and $30 million

   When you have precious, sensitive cargo that absolutely,

call on Starr's Federal Investigative Express!
</P>
<P>
   That's right, Starr's Federal Investigative Express, for all
your publicity-stunt needs. Clad in crisp uniforms and packing
enough heat to overpower a small government, Kenneth Starr's
friends with the Capitol Hill police will carefully, lovingly pack
your top-secret findings in sturdy cardboard boxes and then load
them into sergeant-at-arms vans, where the info will be whisked
straight to the steps of the U.S. Capitol. Perfect for a photo op!
</P>
<P>
   Oh well. So much for Mark McGwire's attempts to distract us from
the madness in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   After a four-year investigation that exhausted even the wonkiest
of Washington insiders and exasperated most of the nation, Kenneth
Starr _ the Captain Queeg of our times _ has finally completed his
witch-hunt, I mean, probe, into the Whitewater land deal.
</P>
<P>
   That's what this is about, right? Whitewater? At least that's
where it started _ but somehow we all ended up talking about
stained dresses and secret-message neckties and Walt Whitman's
poetry and the legal definitions of groping, fondling and heavy
petting.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about the new novels from Tom Wolfe and John Updike. The
most hotly anticipated title of the fall season is ``Behind Closed
Doors,'' the 18-volume report from Starr's office that supposedly
contains the salacious and shocking details of presidential
behavior so morally grotesque and legally questionable it will be
the foundation for impeachment hearings or even the second U.S.
presidential resignation in history.
</P>
<P>
   As I write this, details of the report's release are still being
worked out. Who will be the first to read it? Who will be the first
to highlight the dirty parts so the rest of us don't have to slog
through thousands of pages of legalese?
</P>
<P>
   One thing we know for sure: Oprah Winfrey has no plans to make
Starr's report the next selection of her Book-of-the-Month club.
Whew.
</P>
<P>
   I haven't read one sentence of the report, but I'm sure it
contains meticulously gathered evidence that Clinton engaged in a
sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky, and then lied or at least
finessed the truth when asked under oath about the nature of his
dealings with the former intern. And to that I say: So what.
</P>
<P>
   This investigation should have been called to a halt months ago.
There is absolutely no basis for impeachment, there will never be
any impeachment hearings, and Bill Clinton ain't going to resign. A
year from now this will all be a distant, embarrassing memory for
everyone involved.
</P>
<P>
   Right about now, the Clinton-bashers among you are angrily
reaching for pen and paper _ or, more likely, logging onto your
E-mail system so you can instantly send me a nasty missive.
</P>
<P>
   Let me save you the trouble. Here's what you're going to say:
</P>
<P>
   ``You liberal media elite types just don't get it, do you? This
isn't about Clinton's personal life, it's about the president of
the United States lying under oath! It's about perjury, obstruction
of justice, tampering with potential witnesses, blatant abuse of
the office of the presidency!''
</P>
<P>
   No, the Iran-Contra hearings were about all those things and
more. This is about an independent counsel investigation run amok.
</P>
<P>
   Starr was allowed to bring the Monica matter into play because
of the civil lawsuit, since dismissed, filed by Paula Jones.
Clinton's relationship with Lewinsky would help to establish a
pattern of harassment, according to attorneys for Ms. Jones.
</P>
<P>
   So when asked about Lewinsky, Clinton lied. Or at least, he
hemmed and hawed and used legally acceptable terms to fudge the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   Is that perjury? Sure. And if we pursued perjury charges against
every man and woman who has lied under oath during civil
proceedings such as divorce trials and harassment claims, there
would be tens of thousands of such cases clogging up the
courtrooms.
</P>
<P>
   After insulting the nation with his half-hearted non-apology a
few weeks ago, Clinton has gone to great lengths to make amends,
with at least three mea culpas, each one more direct than the last.
What's he supposed to do next, order 280 million of those cutesy
Shoebox greeting cards and pen a personalized apology to every man,
woman and child in the country?
</P>
<P>
   The president of the United States is a leering cad who lied to
everyone, including the independent counsel, about a pathetic
affair with a woman half his age. We all know this. If he had lied
about trading arms for hostages, or bombings in Vietnam, that would
be a different matter.
</P>
<P>
   But we're talking about sex, lies and audiotape here. That
Clinton didn't immediately confess a stupid affair with a stupid
young girl is hardly grounds for impeachment or resignation, at
least not in a rational world.

SENATE REPUBLICANS JOIN HOUSE COUNTERPARTS IN TAX CUT PUSH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Del., N.J., N.M.)  (js) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican leaders in the Senate said Thursday that
they would join their counterparts in the House in pushing for
passage of an $80 billion tax cut this year, despite unyielding
opposition from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans in the Senate have been ambivalent about
pressing for a sizable tax reduction, which would require dipping
into projected federal budget surpluses. But they have grown
increasingly willing to challenge President Clinton's insistence
that the surplus be put in reserve until the nation settles on a
plan to shore up the Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   In part, their change of heart was spurred by requests from the
administration that billions of dollars in emergency spending be
paid for from the surplus, including money for the Bosnia
peacekeeping mission, increased security for U.S. embassies, aid to
farmers and the year 2000 computer problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the president wants to spend the surplus, why shouldn't
Republicans be able to look at tax cuts,'' said Sen. Pete Domenici
of New Mexico, the chairman of the Budget Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision Thursday also appeared to reflect a growing
willingness among Republicans to press the advantage they have
gained from Clinton's problems.
</P>
<P>
   Although the House is likely to pass a tax cut worth as much as
$80 billion over the next five years before Congress adjourns early
next month, the prospects for similar legislation in the Senate are
considerably less certain.
</P>
<P>
   Any tax bill that is financed by the surplus would need 60 votes
to pass the Senate. Republicans hold 55 seats, and some of the
party's moderates oppose any big tax cut this year. But Republicans
say they think they may be able to win the votes of some Democrats
by fashioning a tax bill that provides politically popular cuts
like a reduction in taxes for two-income couples who suffer from
the so-called marriage penalty.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I think there will be a lot of Democratic support for many of
our proposals,'' said Sen. William Roth Jr. of Delaware, the
chairman of the Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials said they will not drop their
opposition to using the surplus for tax cuts. In a letter sent to
Speaker Newt Gingrich on Wednesday night, Erskine Bowles, the White
House chief of staff, said he was ``disappointed that the House
leadership has called for breaking our budget discipline by
squandering the surplus prior to saving Social Security first.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, the senior Democrat on the
Budget Committee, said it was important to retain fiscal discipline
because the projected surpluses would disappear before they are
realized if the economy goes into recession. &QL;

   UNDATED - Maybe it's because Mark McGwire hit his 61st home run
of the season on Labor Day, but this whole home-run race is
starting to feel like a national holiday.
</P>
<P>
   And just in time.
</P>
<P>
   After the combative strike that tore major league baseball apart
four years ago and its bitter aftertaste _ there was no World
Series, you may recall, which still sounds as strange as if they'd
canceled Christmas _ everyone talks about how McGwire and Sammy
Sosa's run at Roger Maris has been good for baseball.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt that's true.
</P>
<P>
   But it's good for the rest of us, too.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you're rooting for the St. Louis Cardinals' McGwire or
the Chicago Cubs' Sosa, or you're holding out hope for the Seattle
Mariners' Ken Griffey Jr. to pull off a miracle, the excitement
over the most hallowed record in sports gives us something to cheer
for.
</P>
<P>
   Don't take that for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Every last inch of our popular culture is coated with thick
coats of irony and cynicism. It's not cool to cheer for something.
It's cool to cheer (begin ital) against (end ital) it or to at
least chip away at it while you belittle it.
</P>
<P>
   But there is an innocence to the home-run race, a freshness. It
seems almost quaint. We are, after all, rooting for grown men who
play a kids' game. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Andro, schmandro
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there has been a flap over McGwire's use of ``andro,'' a
muscle-enhancing supplement that's made so many headlines.
Remember, though, that it is perfectly legal in baseball. You can't
ticket a guy for speeding if he's driving 35 in a 55 mph zone.
</P>
<P>
   That's just something for people to complain about, people who
can't enjoy the chase. And what's not to enjoy? Yes, it's covered
endlessly on television, radio and in newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   So what? It's what everyone is talking about, whether they're
serious seamheads or they think a full count is a sated vampire.
It's just plain fun, pure and simple.
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, I like baseball just fine, but I'm not one of those
Bob Costas types who think the game is a sacred metaphor for the
American way of life. It's not a quasi-religion. You won't even
find me joining a baseball rotisserie league, poring obsessively
over yesterday's box scores. It's a fun game to watch, but it's
just that _ a game.
</P>
<P>
   But this home-run race is more.
</P>
<P>
   Networks have been breaking into other events to show us
McGwire's at-bats. Newspapers carry running scores of where McGwire
and Sosa stand. Sure, there's more hype than you'll find at a Bruce
Willis movie. But in this case, that's part of the fun. &QL; 
 &QL; 
What's the big deal? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Why, you ask? Who cares how far and how often a couple of
overpaid men hit home runs? Don't we have more important things to
worry about?
</P>
<P>
   Of course we do. That's the whole point.
</P>
<P>
   The home-run race means so much because, in reality, it means
nothing at all.
</P>
<P>
   That's the beauty of any hobby, any diversion, whether it be
model railroading or collecting stamps or scanning the skies every
night for signs of alien life. (Actually, that last is a little
weird.)
</P>
<P>
   I got chills watching McGwire hit No. 61. I manage to be near a
television or a radio every time he or Sosa step into the batter's
box. And when they do, like everyone else, I am transported.
</P>
<P>
   Then we aren't thinking about Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky
and the various entanglements _ legal and otherwise _ those names
entail.
</P>
<P>
   We aren't thinking about the stock market, worrying whether our
pensions are slipping down the drain.
</P>
<P>
   We aren't trying to figure out which candidate is the lesser of
two evils, which one will shame us the least if we give him our
vote.
</P>
<P>
   All of that is waiting for us when McGwire and Sosa are done. It
will still be there long after the season is over, the chase
finished. But for the duration of three strikes and four balls or
some combination thereof, all that matters is how far they can send
one, and how many times.
</P>
<P>
   I hope these guys both hit 70. We could use it. &QL;

EX-KGB MAN PRIMAKOV `A KNOWN QUANTITY' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ US officials privately describe Boris N. Yeltsin's
latest choice for prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov, as the best of
a number of unappetizing choices. But they acknowledge too that he
has enough credibility with Western countries, free-market Russian
reformers, and ardent Communists to earn grudging respect from all
sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, he is the right man at the right time for this
job,'' said Edward Djerejian, a former US ambassador to Israel and
Syria, assistant secretary of State for Near East Affairs, and head
of the political section of the US embassy in Moscow from 1979 to
1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeltsin needs a prime minister who will be able to bridge the
reformers in Russia and the old guard,'' added Djerejian, who has
known Primakov for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Michael D. McCurry said the United States
expects a ``good and close'' relationship with Primakov, who is
expected to be confirmed quickly by the State Duma, Russia's lower
house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Djerijian's comments were more positive than those of US
officials familiar with Primakov, who did not want to be named.
``He's a known quantity and there are no surprises,'' said an
official who monitors Russia. ``That's part of the problem: There
are no surprises. He's not a reformer. He's a KGB Arab expert, with
a world view that doesn't necessarily match our own.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Primakov became chief of Russia's feared intelligence
service, the KGB, after years of diplomacy and espionage in the
Mideast. At the end of 1991, he moved to run its overseas
successor, the Foreign Intelligence Service. It was his extensive
experience as Russia's spymaster and his wary relationship with
Washington that gives him enough clout to deal with nationalists at
home, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   They remain far from enthusiastic about the Kremlin survivor,
whom they described as an ``old thinker'' steeped in KGB dogma.
Still, they consider Primakov to be the best candidate that
Washington could have hoped for, given that Russia's parliament
would not accept a reform-minded prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   And as foreign minister, Primakov has been willing to compromise
on some issues. He grudgingly acceded to the expansion of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization, for example. He also cooperated with
Americans on arms-control agreements considered vital by
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem, the specialists agreed, is that Primakov
has no economic training and has not demonstrated any innovative
ideas to deal with Russia's growing crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As Primakov emerged Thursday as the likely prime minister in
Moscow's game of musical chairs, the official emphasized the good
news: Most of the other contenders for the job were worse in the
administration's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest doubts about Primakov arose in early 1991, when he
traveled to Baghdad on behalf of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in
an unsuccessful attempt to avert the Gulf War. American officials
said that Primakov, who had extensive experience as a spy in the
region, was less of a mediator than an informal adviser to Saddam
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Still, since becoming acting foreign minister in 1996, Primakov
has worked closely with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
State Department spokesman James P. Rubin spoke of Primakov with
measured praise, calling him ``a worthy interlocutor on a number of
subjects ... and on several occasions a genuine partner.''

AUSTRIA TO RETURN ART TAKEN BY NAZIS TO RIGHTFUL OWNERS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE PERLEZ    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ Senior ministers of the Austrian government
sent a draft law on the restitution of art confiscated by the Nazis
to Parliament Thursday and said they expected that some paintings,
furniture and other objects would be returned to their rightful
owners by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the law would mean that several major museums in
Vienna would have to give up works, from paintings to tapestry to
armor, that have been on display for decades.
</P>
<P>
   The culture minister, Elisabeth Gehrer, said before a meeting of
the ministers Thursday that the government wanted to correct the
wrongs of the past.
</P>
<P>
   The Nazis stripped Austrian Jews of valuable art just before the
start of World War II. After the war, Austrian authorities refused
to allow Jewish families who had fled into exile to retrieve their
artworks and take them abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our will to clear up after 50 years what has not been
done before,'' Mrs. Gehrer said. ``We cannot make wrongdoings
right, but we can make justice possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The Austrian branch of the Rothschilds is among the Jewish
families whose extensive art holdings were taken by the Nazis and
subsequently held by art museums here, including the
Kunsthistorische and the Belvedere. Baroness Bettina de Rothschild,
who lives in southern Austria, said she had been told Thursday that
her family could expect to recover its heritage, including two
portraits by Franz Hals, ``before the end of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Baroness, 73, fled into exile as a young girl days before
the Germans marched into Austria, and later married an American
diplomat, Matthew Looram. She praised Mrs. Gehrer for her
perseverance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give her enormous credit,'' the baroness said. ``She has
shown great guts. I don't think it's very popular.''
</P>
<P>
   The leader of Austria's far-right Freedom Party, Joerg Haider,
said on Wednesday that the government's effort to return the
confiscated art was too great a favor to Jews.
</P>
<P>
   The move to return the art began after an uproar last winter
over the disputed ownership of two Egon Schiele paintings lent by
an Austrian foundation for a retrospective at the Museum of Modern
Art in New York. Claims by descendants of the works' prewar owners
were outlined in articles in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Mrs. Gehrer said the government expected
Parliament to approve the law in October. Ownership claims would
then have to be reviewed by a new six-member commission.
</P>
<P>
   The review is considered a formality in the case of works
belonging to the Rothschild, Lederer and Bloch-Bauer families, who
left Austria and have formally made claims since the war. Those
family collections and 400 to 500 other items, mainly coins and
armor, have been fully investigated, and their rightful ownership
affirmed, said Mrs. Gehrer's spokeswoman, Heidi Marie Gluck.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gehrer said art stolen by the Nazis and held in Austria
fell into three categories. The first covers art taken by the Nazis
and never returned to its owners because the Austrian government
refused to allow it to be taken out of the country. Those works
were generally donated or dedicated to national museums and
galleries.

<P>
   Among them are 10 paintings that the Kunsthistorische acquired
in 1946. They include such prized 17th-century Dutch works as a
``Portrait of a Man'' and ``Portrait of a Woman'' by Frans Hals and
paintings by Meindert Hobbema, Aelbert Cuyp, Jan Wynants and Frans
van Mieris.
</P>
<P>
   The baroness said she and her family were looking forward to
seeing the paintings, carpets and tapestries that are now in the
Museum of Applied Arts and a host of other artworks in their home.
</P>
<P>
   A second category of art established in the draft law covers
works that were acquired on the open market but are now believed to
have a ``shady'' provenance, Mrs. Gehrer said.
</P>
<P>
   A third category covers works that could not be returned to
their rightful owners despite restitution efforts after the war and
that reverted to the state as ``ownerless.'' Those are to be handed
over to a national fund that will decide what to do with them.

HIGH COURT TO HEAR APPEAL OF CENSUS RULING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Acting with unusual speed in advance of its new
term, the Supreme Court Thursday agreed to hear the Clinton
administration's appeal of a ruling last month that barred the use
of statistical sampling in the census for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The justices announced they would hear the case on Nov. 30. Both
the administration and the House of Representatives, which had
brought the successful lawsuit to block the Census Bureau's
sampling plan, had urged the court to put the highly charged case
on a fast track.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau's ``ability to conduct the most accurate
census possible will be seriously threatened'' if the question of
permissible methodology is not resolved by next March, the two
sides told the court in a brief they signed and filed jointly on
Wednesday. The administration filed its formal appeal on Friday of
last week.
</P>
<P>
   While the schedule the court announced Thursday does not
guarantee a decision by March, it substantially increases the odds
in favor of one. Other new cases the court accepts in the coming
weeks will not be argued until early 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's appeal from the Aug. 24 ruling of a special
three-judge U.S. District Court here presents three basic questions
for the Supreme Court: first, whether the House of Representatives
was the proper legal party to challenge the Census Bureau's
proposed use of sampling; second, whether federal statutes
governing the census permit sampling; and finally, whether sampling
is constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   In its unanimous ruling last month, the district court found
both that the House had standing to bring the case and that the
Census Bureau's plan violated a 1957 federal law governing
administration of the census. Having found that sampling was
illegal, the district court said there was no reason to address the
constitutional issue, which is whether the reference in Article I,
Section 2 to ``the actual enumeration'' precludes any method other
than a conventional head count.
</P>
<P>
   While the administration and the Republican-controlled House
were allies before the court this week in urging a speedy review of
the decision, they remain legal as well as political adversaries in
a debate that goes back to the Bush administration's refusal to
make a statistical adjustment to correct an acknowledged undercount
in the last census, in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The political ramifications of this debate stem from the fact
that while census takers miss millions of people _ some 4 million
in 1990 _ the undercount is not evenly distributed. City dwellers,
poor people and ethnic minorities in particular are missed out of
proportion to their numbers. While the 1990 census missed about 2
percent of the overall population, it missed 4.8 percent of the
black population and 5.2 percent of the Hispanic population. With
these groups most likely to vote for Democrats, the disparate
effect of the undercount is political as well as racial. The census
determines the apportionment not only of the House but of state
legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   New York City and a coalition of other big cities sued the
Census Bureau over its refusal to adjust the 1990 census, with the
Supreme Court ruling unanimously in 1996 that no such adjustment
was constitutionally required. That decision, Wisconsin vs. New
York, left open the current question of whether a statistical
adjustment is permissible.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In its initial argument in the new case, U.S. Department of
Commerce vs. U.S. House of Representatives, No. 98-404, the
administration contends that the district court made a fundamental
error in allowing the House of Representatives' lawsuit to proceed
in the first place. The House itself can claim no concrete injury
from one census-taking method or another, the administration's
brief argues; the effect on any individual member is ``entirely
speculative'' and the House ``will continue to be composed of 435
Members and will continue to exercise the same constitutional
powers.'' Consequently, the brief asserts, the lawsuit did not
present the type of ``case or controversy that is within the
jurisdiction of the federal courts.''
</P>
<P>
   On the merits of the dispute, the administration argues that the
district court misunderstood the relevant provisions of the Census
Act, which use confusing language that appears both to permit and
to forbid sampling. Addressing the constitutional question, the
brief asserts that the phrase ``actual enumeration'' does not refer
to a particular methodology.
</P>
<P>
   According to the schedule the court issued Thursday, the House
will file a brief responding to these arguments by Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau has proposed to augment the 2000 census by
using three separate sampling techniques. Traditional methods would
be used to count everyone in 90 percent of the households in each
census tract.

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   BOSTON _ After a year when 34 students nationwide died from
binge drinking, the reaction of those on a national list of ``Top
Ten Party Schools'' was easily scripted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mortified,'' said Mary Thomas, the dean of students at Trinity
College in Hartford, where that designation prompted a ban on
possession of hard liquor this year.
</P>
<P>
   Less predictable were the responses from those on the list of
``Top Ten Stone Cold Sober Schools.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just not an accurate picture of this campus,'' insisted
Mount Holyoke spokesman Kevin McCaffrey.
</P>
<P>
   The umbrage on either side suggests the struggles schools face
to frame workable policies on alcohol amid much-publicized
crackdowns on campus drinking.
</P>
<P>
   No one, of course, advocates binge drinking, and everyone
recognizes that students recovering from an alcohol-induced stupor
can't do what their parents are paying tens of thousands of dollars
to do _ which is, after all, learn. But alumni, students, and,
privately, even administrators express some ambivalence about the
get-tough policies that will greet many students this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Schools end up in a delicate balancing act, between averting
tragedy and recognizing time-honored rites of passage, between zero
tolerance and zero fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely a tension,'' said Joel Epstein of the
Higher Education Center for Alcohol and Other Drug Prevention in
Newton, which tracks the number of alcohol-related deaths. ``A lot
of us who went to these schools, who are teaching at these schools,
have fond memories of coming of age, and part of that is
experimenting with alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools are in a tough spot: They want to make things safe,
but there is this sense that this is what college is about. For
young people ... the mixed messages are a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   The University of Massachusetts at Amherst devotes the bulk of
its most recent campus magazine to ``Thinking About Drinking.''
While it discusses the university's new efforts to get tough on
binge drinking with a ``three strikes and you're out'' policy, it
also waxes woozy about the pleasures of drink, with a warmly lit
cover shot of a now-defunct Amherst bar, a nostalgic history of
drink, and a fond memoir written by a former fraternity member.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the complications of this particular cultural quandary
is that alcohol is so deeply embedded in the fabric of college
life,'' said a letter from the editor, Patricia Wright.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey of alumni, the letter notes, 20 percent mentioned
one of many local bars as the place they called home during their
college years.
</P>
<P>
   ``For these alumni and thousands like them,'' Wright continued,
``drinking was among the unregretted pleasures of campus life.
Doubtless it remains so for many, if not most, students today.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Vasconcellos, the assistant dean of students who helped
write a task force report on alcohol on the campus, added,
``There's this awareness about alcohol; on the other hand, there's
also this feeling that college is the place where you do that. I
think we're in a really odd time in that way.''
</P>
<P>
   And crackdown or not, the same is true on many campuses.
</P>
<P>
   As the weekend arrived at Boston College, even freshmen who had
been on campus for a mere five days were savvy enough to know how
to buy beer, and at which pubs their friends were gathering.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you really want to find it, you can get it,'' said Jennifer
Casper, 18, a freshman from Washington, D.C. ``They gave us this
whole scary thing during orientation about how there'd be no
tolerance, but a lot of that is just talk. So far, it doesn't seem
like it's been that tough.''
</P>
<P>
   The legal drinking age in all the New England states is 21.
</P>
<P>
   Students recognize their schools' interests in reducing binge
drinking _ and its attendant risks of assault, date rape, and
vandalism. At the same time, they expect that partying will be as
much a part of college life as classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``College is synonymous with drinking, taking those risks,''
said a 19-year-old BC sophomore. ``It's sad to say, but it's
true.''
</P>
<P>
   Added another 19-year-old from BC: ``We're responsible adults
now; we should be the ones deciding what we do with our weekends.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how tightly college life and alcohol are tied is revealed
each year in the Princeton Review college guide's top 10 lists. A
spot on the sober side might attract parents concerned about
safety. But it also might deter potential students.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people see `Stone Cold Sober,' they wrongly get the
impression that this is a school where students devote all their
time to study and serious pursuit,'' Mt. Holyoke's McCaffrey said.
``On the other hand, if that raises issues for us, what does that
mean?''
</P>
<P>
   Most colleges, he says, would like to end up on neither list.
</P>
<P>
   More and more colleges began adopting stricter policies against
underage drinking after a widely publicized Harvard School of
Public Health study in 1993 said that 44 percent of students
surveyed on 116 campuses had reported so-called binge drinking,
consuming four to five or more drinks in an evening. At
fraternities and sororities, the percentage of binge drinkers about
doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Last year presented more tragic reasons for crackdowns: a death
at Louisiana State University, five at Virginia colleges, and the
death of fraternity pledge Scott Krueger at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, hardly known as a party school.
</P>
<P>
   But those who track college policies say there is still more
tolerance than there is toughness.
</P>
<P>
   ``There clearly isn't any trend among universities nationwide to
suddenly get tough,'' said Arthur G. Broadhurst, a senior vice
president of United Educators Insurance, which insures most US
schools. ``There is a flurry of concern after a crisis, but then it
tends to be business as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   The ambivalence about how best to deal with alcohol on campus
extends to the researchers who helped make binge drinking the No. 1
crisis. Some, such as those behind the Harvard study, advocate
get-tough policies.
</P>
<P>
   But others say hysteria about binge drinking only encourages
students to think it is the norm _ just at an age when they seek to
conform to the norm. Newer campaigns focus on convincing students
that experimenting with alcohol doesn't have to mean getting
falling-down drunk.

MARTINI BACK IN FAVOR WITH AMERICANS

``jalapeno'' needs a tilde over the ``n'' 
 
By MICHAEL LONSFORD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The first sip begins as icy as a lover's rebuff, but
ends as warm as a sweetheart's embrace.
</P>
<P>
   The classic martini may be the perfect cocktail. Chilled, clean,
bracing, sophisticated _ and pure.
</P>
<P>
   Like cigars and red meat, martinis are back. But the majority of
martinis today bear little resemblance to the original. What used
to be simply a mixture of gin and dry vermouth with an olive (or
onion, which makes it a Gibson) now has been bastardized by the
addition of such things as chocolate liqueur, orange juice,
cranberry juice, limes, jalapenos, pickled okra or worse. When
faced with such variations on a perfect theme, more than one
veteran martini drinker has been known to mutter that ``this may be
the end of civilization as we know it ...''
</P>
<P>
   If a ``real'' martini is as clear as crystal, its origin is as
clear as mud. Some say the martini was concocted during
Prohibition, when ``bathtub gin'' was easier to make than an ersatz
scotch or bourbon. And certainly its heyday was the 1930s, '40s and
'50s. But the fact is, the martini first became a gleam in an
American bartender's eye sometime during the last half of the
1800s.
</P>
<P>
   Some link it to several unconfirmable tales about a California
town called Martinez. Several references mention a New York City
bartender making up a cocktail for the financier John D.
Rockefeller. But since Rockefeller reportedly was a teetotaler,
that seems unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   The first martini ``recipe,'' which dates to the 1860s or '70s,
may sound repugnant today: four parts sweet vermouth to one part
gin.
</P>
<P>
   Today, of course, a martini is much drier, often containing no
vermouth at all _ and usually no gin because vodka has overtaken
gin as the liquor of choice for most martini drinkers.
</P>
<P>
   Martinis became a symbol of American sophistication before World
War II. Martinis often had starring roles in Hollywood films, such
as the 1934 movie ``The Thin Man,'' starring William Powell and
Myrna Loy.
</P>
<P>
   Powell tells the bartender there's a rhythm to mixing a martini:
``A dry martini, you always shake to waltz time.''
</P>
<P>
   When Paris was liberated in 1944, author Ernest Hemingway
reportedly ordered 73 martinis for a squad of American GIs. FDR
made the first legal martini in the White House after Repeal, and
the ``cocktail hour'' was born.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the bon mot ``I must get out of these wet clothes and
into a dry martini''? It's been credited to, or claimed by,
humorist Robert Benchley, drama critic Alexander Woollcott,
publisher Bennett Cerf and actress Mae West. It's an immensely
clever line; does it really matter who said it?
</P>
<P>
   There are two indisputable facts about today's martinis. First,
the majority of them are made with vodka, which became popular in
this country in the 1950s. Its neutral flavor made it an excellent
mixable drink, and vodka was welcomed by those less fond of the
pungent flavor of gin. Second, vermouth is rarely used.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of some upscale restaurant-bars in Houston underlined
this.
</P>
<P>
   At Sabine, veteran bartender Bill Ealy said he serves vodka far
more than gin, and as for vermouth: ``Unless someone asks for it, I
found it's easier to put some in than take it out.''
</P>
<P>
   John L. Price, bartender at the Confederate House for more than
40 years, has seen the martini come and go in popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early years, it was gin, not vodka. But in the '80s and
'90s _ now, it's gin only if they ask for it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Does he use vermouth? ``Not anymore, although sometimes you can
soak your olives in it,'' referred to as drunken olives.
</P>
<P>
   What about ``up'' vs. ``on the rocks''?
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be `straight up,''' Price said, ``but in the '70s
and '80s, more people wanted it on the rocks. Now in the '90s, they
want it `up' again. They like the look of that martini glass.''
</P>
<P>
   At Vallone's, bartender Richard Hazzard says he makes a martini
the way the customer asks for it. A ``dry'' martini has very little
vermouth, and if it's requested, Hazzard uses a 14-1 gin-vermouth
ratio.
</P>
<P>
   (This, incidentally, is about the same ratio as Hemingway's
well-known ``Montgomery.'' In the delightful book ``The Martini,''
Barnaby Conrad III says that in World War II, Field Marshal
Montgomery said he liked to have the odds in battle to be 15-1 on
his side, and Hemingway liked his martinis in a 15-1, gin-vermouth
proportion. Hence, the name ``Montgomery.'')
</P>
<P>
   How about the old ``shaken'' vs. ``stirred'' question? This was
popularized by James Bond, whose preferred martini was called a
``Vesper'' after the double agent Vesper Lynd: ``three measures of
Gordon's (gin), one of vodka, half a measure of Kina Lillet ...
then add a large thin slice of lemon peel,'' and of course,
``shaken, not stirred.'' Bond said that stirring ``bruises the
gin,'' although you would think it would be the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Ruiz at Anthony's voiced another common observation:
Martinis are increasingly popular with women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martinis are as individual as those who consume them and
should be tailored as such. Flavored martinis, ice cold, are very
popular at Tony's, especially our house Cosmopolitan,'' said Tony's
bartender Jerry Wantz.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to today's martini variations.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmopolitans (vodka, triple sec, lime juice and cranberry
juice) also are popular at Brennan's and other places around town.
In fact, flavored martinis with premium vodkas are the latest rage.
Some of the requested flavored martinis include the Cajun Martini
(vodka and dash of Tabasco with a jalapeno), Chocolate Martini
(vodka and creme de cocoa), Friar Tuck Martini (vodka and
Frangelico), Paisley Martini (vodka/gin, vermouth and a teaspoon of
scotch) and a Rice Martini (vodka/gin and sake).
</P>
<P>
   One of the great appeals of a martini is its glacial coldness.
The best way to achive this is to put the glasses and shaker in the
freezer. A metal shaker chills colder than glass.
</P>
<P>
   You also can keep gin or vodka in the refrigerator, though not
in the freezer. The vermouth must be at room temperature, but since
you're not going to use more than a few molecules, it doesn't
matter.
</P>
<P>
   If you do prefer a nuance of vermouth to take the edge off the
gin or vodka, many ``mixologists'' like to pour a splash of
vermouth in the glass, swirl it around to coat the glass, then dump
it out. Some even use a little spritzer or spray bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows what a martini glass looks like, but what you may
not realize is that they come in several sizes. Some are quite
large; some bars today make martinis in 10-ounce glasses. That's
like having your three-martini lunch, or dinner, in one fell swoop.
</P>
<P>
   There are two disadvantages to these glasses. First, there is
going to be a lot of liquor in that glass.
</P>
<P>
   According to Conrad in ``The Martini,'' W.C. Fields drank two
quarts of gin martinis a day. And his nose paid the price. Those
red eruptions that covered his nose are called gin blossoms.
</P>
<P>
   The other disadvantage is that with such a large glass, unless
you quaff your drink in a hurry, the martini will get warm _ and
that glacial quality is as important to a martini as the gin or
vermouth.
</P>
<P>
   So mix yourself a martini _ even if it's an unconventional one _
and sip it slowly as you enjoy ...
</P>
<P>
   ``A Drink With Something in It'' by Ogden Nash:
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something about a martini,
</P>
<P>
   A tingle remarkably pleasant;
</P>
<P>
   A yellow, a mellow martini,
</P>
<P>
   I wish I had one at present.
</P>
<P>
   There is something about a martini,
</P>
<P>
   Ere the dining and dancing begin,
</P>
<P>
   And to tell you the truth,
</P>
<P>
   It is not the vermouth _
</P>
<P>
   I think that perhaps it's the gin.''

INTERNET PREPARES FOR HUGE DEMAND FOR STARR REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington lawmakers aren't the only people scrambling to
prepare for the release of Kenneth W. Starr's report. Major sites
all over the Internet are girding for what could be their biggest
traffic surge ever, as millions of people around the world try to
download copies of the report.
</P>
<P>
   House members said Thursday that an electronic version of the
report would be published Friday afternoon on three government Web
sites. But with more than 50 million Internet users in the United
States alone, these sites would likely quickly be overwhelmed.
However, a number of major commercial sites, including America
Online, CNN, MSNBC, and the Boston Globe's Web service plan to post
copies of the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working directly with the government to get hold of
that document,'' said Kerrin Roberts, a spokesman for CNN
Interactive.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, CNN is getting ready to handle a torrent of
requests for the report. CNN measures traffic by the number of Web
pages distributed to visitors. The site's highest traffic level was
reached on Sept. 1, the day after a dramatic drop in stock prices.
CNN distributed 22 million Web pages that day, but is planning for
even more Friday.
</P>
<P>
   To handle the load, CNN will go into what it calls ``breaking
news'' mode. It will redesign its Web pages to contain fewer
graphics and other fancy features that take longer to download.
This ``just-the-facts-ma'am'' approach should boost the amount of
traffic the CNN system can handle.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet itself can easily handle the load. The problem is
with the ``server'' computers at each site that transmit the data.
Each server can handle a large but limited number of requests. When
too many people request data, the server slows to a crawl or
crashes altogether.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many Web users will be at home, relying on slow
modems connected to telephone lines. This means they'll have to
stay connected to the server for a longer period, preventing others
from getting access. At 445 pages, the Starr report would probably
take six or seven minutes to download using a common home modem,
compared to a few seconds for a business equipped with a high-speed
digital line.
</P>
<P>
   To cope with this problem, the Boston Globe Web site and a
number of other sites are adding extra server computers to meet the
demand.

BRITISH TROOPS TO CEASE PATROLS IN BELFAST, RELEASE SOME
PRISONERS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES F. CLARITY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ Officials said Thursday that British
troops would stop patrolling the Belfast area this weekend and that
some paramilitary prisoners would be released in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   The decisions, an indication of significant progress in the
Northern Ireland peace effort, came as the head of the Protestant
Unionist Party, David Trimble, and the political leader of the
Irish Republican Army, Gerry Adams, held private talks for the
first time. They met for 45 minutes on the issues that still divide
them, principally the timing of disarmament by the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday the two men addressed each other briefly for the first
time at a meeting of leaders of the new Northern Ireland Assembly,
which is to enact the political reforms of the peace agreement
reached last spring. Trimble is the first minister of the Assembly,
and Adams is a member of it.
</P>
<P>
   At Thursday's meeting the two men, until recently openly bitter
political enemies, went into a second-floor room at the Parliament
Buildings and talked without benefit of aides and spokesmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first time ever that a leader of Irish
Republicanism sat down face to face with a leader of Ulster
Unionism,'' said Richard McAuley, an assistant to Adams.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the painful summer we've had, we deserve one of these
days,'' said Monica McWilliams a member of the Assembly
representing the Women's Coalition. ``This is a good message to put
out,'' she added, ``that the heads of unionism and republicanism
are sitting down together.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the negotiations to come on details of the peace agreement,
which are supposed to give Catholics more political power, she
said, ``There are still enemies'' in the Assembly. ``There are
still people who hate each other. But still this is an important
day, a historic day.''
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawal of British troops to their barracks this weekend
was announced by Ronnie Flanagan, the police chief of the
predominantly Protestant British province, who controls all
security force movements.
</P>
<P>
   He said the withdrawal, which will mean no more young British
soldiers stalking the streets in full combat uniform wielding
automatic rifles, was possible because ``we currently have a
reduced terrorist threat.'' He said it was a ``distinct
possibility'' that some of the 17,500 British troops in the
province would return to the mainland soon.
</P>
<P>
   A reduced British military presence on the streets is seen as a
concession to demands by Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA,
that the province be ``demilitarized'' before the IRA can be
expected to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that as many as 12 paramilitary prisoners,
Catholic and Protestant, would probably be released in the next few
day before the expiration of their terms. The early release of
prisoners is a principal demand of both Catholic and Protestant
groups.
</P>
<P>
   After their meeting Adams and Trimble scoffed at questions from
reporters about whether they, as old foes, had shaken hands in
private, symbolically Thursday morning. They said they hadn't.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders said they had discussed the central problem of
the negotiations: whether Sinn Fein members could become ministers
in a new provisional government before the IRA began disarming.
Trimble said it was a ``chicken and egg'' problem, avoiding his
usual anti-Republican bombast.
</P>
<P>
   For his part Adams refrained from his usual jabs at Trimble.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Before dawn Thursday, ambulances _ some with a red
crescent on the side, some with the Star of David _ raced through
southern Gaza to a bus crash. Palestinian and Israeli medics worked
side by side to treat about 50 injured Palestinian workers and rush
them to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the ambulance drivers were Jewish settlers from
neighboring enclaves who had never before set foot in
Palestinian-controlled Gaza and who usually travel to and from
their enclaves with army escorts.
</P>
<P>
   At a moment when many Israelis and Palestinians wonder whether
relations between them can ever be normalized, it was a stunningly
efficient collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   All but two of the workers, whose bus had slid off the road on
an oil slick, survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``In such emergencies, there are no differences between Arabs
and Jews,'' Mohammed Abu-Sabala, 28, a construction worker who
suffered a broken neck, said from his hospital bed at the Khan
Younis Hospital in southern Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem on Thursday, however, another incident involving
Israeli medics and Palestinians ended tragically, underscoring why
the cooperation in Gaza was the subject of daylong press attention
here. Usually, the movement of Israeli ambulances into Palestinian
communities is a tense affair.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, Kamleh Mohammed al-Nazer, 41, who was shot last
Saturday by Israeli security forces using rubber-encased bullets,
died. Mrs. Nazer, the single mother of four, was shot ``by
mistake,'' according to the Jerusalem police chief, during a
violent confrontation between the Israeli forces and youths in the
Arab neighborhood of Shuafat on the outskirts of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation followed the arrival of an Israeli ambulance
to pick up the body of a man who had died at the local clinic of a
heart attack. The clinic was surrounded by Palestinians who had
heard a rumor that the man had died because the ambulance had taken
too long to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   A human rights group, Physicians for Human Rights/Israel, has
complained in court that Israeli ambulances either do not respond
to emergencies in certain Palestinian neighborhoods or delay their
response. The ambulance drivers summon police escorts first.
</P>
<P>
   In the incident Saturday, the youths pelted the police escorts
with rocks and then firebombs. A man who said he was a witness,
Abedrado al-Fasfus, said the youths were provoked by police, who,
he said, shoved through the crowd to get into the clinic, knocking
two men to the ground and then summoning reinforcements. Police
said the youths attacked first and that the officers were stormed
and responded not only with rubber bullets but with live
ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Nazer had wandered into the melee on her way to buy
vegetables for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret the loss of life,'' Maj. Gen. Yair Yitzhaki said on
Israeli army radio Thursday. ``I have no doubt this woman was hit
by mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday afternoon, her body was returned to her small,
neat house where her neighbors waited, draped in white, to wrap her
for burial. When she was carried in through a cloud of incense,
women wailed and fainted. Palestinian photographers crushed so
closely around her that her daughters did not get to say goodbye
before she was whisked away to a mosque.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral procession remained calm. But emotions ran strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a Palestinian did that to an Israeli, they would put him in
jail and take away his house,'' said her cousin, Widad Shabani.
``Is this the will of God? Is this part of their peace process?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Against this backdrop of intense confrontations and
accommodations, Dennis Ross, the U.S. envoy to the Middle East, met
with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been bedridden with
the flu, in his home. Although tight-lipped about his visit, which
is an attempt to break an 18-month deadlock in the peace
negotiations, Ross has called his meetings here productive, and is
expected to stay at least another day.
</P>
<P>
   In the Gaza hospital, families of the Palestinian day laborers,
who had been on their way to work in Israel, surrounded their beds.
Many expressed their gratitude to the Israelis who, because an army
base and a Jewish settlement are so close by, arrived at the scene
before the Palestinian medics. Together they had set up a kind of
field hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has withdrawn from most of Gaza, although several
thousand Jewish settlers live in walled-off communities there in
the midst of about a million Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter asked the patients if it had felt odd to be
rescued by Israelis, one man became incensed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't make politics,'' he said. ``The Israelis did a good
thing.'' &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bracing himself for a long, tough defense of
President Clinton, Senate Democratic minority leader Tom Daschle
was the first to stand before open microphones and yearn for
``closure,'' the cliche word of modern tragedy and its wished-for
ending by stricken participants.
</P>
<P>
   His counterpart in the House, Minority Leader Dick Gephardt,
seemed no less dolorously burdened by the possibility of an
impeachment process. ``We don't do this often, thankfully,'' he
said, speaking outside the chamber while lawmakers within, as if in
escape, talked of such issues as migratory bird hunting regulations
and the English Language Fluency Act. ``You do not overturn an
election of the American people on a whim,'' Gephardt said darkly.
</P>
<P>
   Six blocks away, the Starr report rested through what was a
generally excruciating day of waiting on Capitol Hill, a boxed-up
epic under lock and armed guard, ready to be cued up for its
presentation Friday to the lawmakers and the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The obscure federal building where it rested on 2nd Street
Southwest _ the Gerald R. Ford House Office Annex _ was the first
notice for many denizens that anything here was ever named for
Ford, the former House speaker who rose to the presidency in the
Watergate scandal and now a celebrity golfer. He remains a smiling
witness to all troubled participants in the Clinton sex scandal
inquiry of 1998 that this, too, shall pass away.
</P>
<P>
   Television crews waited outside the nondescript Ford building,
as if the scandal report might osmotically appear a day early as
the leak of all leaks. The crews have been following its path by
government van through Washington traffic as an overture to the
impeachment inquiry that eerily summons images of the Bronco ride
of O.J. Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton will survive,'' Dotty, the waitress at the Market Inn,
down the block from the Ford building, said with great certainty as
she took a break in the day's breezy sunshine. ``I hear them all at
the bar saying what a joke it is, everybody laughing about Clinton,
saying it's his wife's business, nobody else's.''
</P>
<P>
   But most laughter tended to fade toward Capitol Hill, where a
mood of political wanness seemed to mark the day as the eve of
something explosive and all consuming, of a whirlwind to be reaped
at some still unknown cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sadness,'' said Gloria Steele, a 61-year-old retiree
visiting from Louisville, sitting on a shaded park bench as the
Capitol dome gleamed gloriously against the blue sky. ``We'll be
changed by these events with Clinton, by the lack of trust. I grew
up in an era when presidents and Sunday school teachers were role
models.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Sam, was quietly furious at what he described as
the ``greed-driven, money-driven'' world of Washington politics.
``That's the cancer, the money,'' he said, nodding toward the
Capitol. ``It's the moral compass for the people who can survive in
the political system we have structured _ the Bill Clintons of the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   The Steeles moved up the Capital garden path past a cable-strewn
pen where, as the noon hour approached, a mass of assorted
television reporters poised at a thicket of cameras suddenly
gathered their thoughts and primped their hair in near unison,
seconds before the midday bulletin on the latest on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   A group of foreign tourists seemed intrigued. ``I've never seen
so many of the TV people here _ for reasons that I don't need to
verbalize,'' their guide, David Loving, announced loudly. ``I don't
know what to give you first _ current politics or history. I guess
I'll give you history because at least it's standing still.''
</P>
<P>
   But as he talked of architecture, the foreigners eyed the
communications commotion. Jacques Feder, another tour guide, said,
``They keep asking me how can Americans be so obsessed with sex?
It's so banal.''
</P>
<P>
   On camera, the reporters' tone was far more breathless than
banal as they talked to America of looming Constitutional crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Watching and listening from afar, an old Washington hand,
retired Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming, stayed in touch with his old
Washington buddies from his new perch as director of the Institute
of Politics at Harvard's Kennedy School of government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The engines in Washington are melting!'' he boomed in one
phone conversation, offering parody, but wistfulness, too. ``I can
smell it: the energy level. The excitement level. It's out there.
It's a huge generator. It's whirring. It's burning its bearings.
Somethings going to happen. Is it impeachment? Is it resignation?''
</P>
<P>
   Back at the Capitol, Speaker Newt Gingrich stayed far from
parody as he awaited the Starr report's delivery. ``Slow down, take
a deep breath,'' he advised the nation.

PATRIOTS GO WITH EDWARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ A combination of his experience and hard
work in training camp earned Sedrick Shaw the starting running
back's job Monday night in the Patriots' season opener at Denver.
But rookie Robert Edwards has surpassed him and will start Sunday
night against the Indianapolis Colts.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the Patriots coaches decided that Edwards's
potential is too strong to hold back, especially after he gained 50
yards on 13 carries in relief of Shaw (7 for 25) in the 27-21 loss
to the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pete Carroll made the announcement at his daily press
conference Thursday. ``It feels like the right thing to do to try
him,'' said Carroll. ``He did well last week. I don't think it
takes anything away from what Sedrick did last week. We'd like to
see Robert in the role and continue the evaluation. He did show
well. We feel strong about putting him in that position, and I
think he's ready to do that. Sedrick will still be alive in the
rotation. We'll see how much both of them play, but Robert will get
the bulk of the plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's workload will depend directly on Edwards's durability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's in reasonably good shape,'' said Carroll. ``He's
worked on his conditioning in practice. His game conditioning is
still developing. We'll continue to monitor that.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no problem getting him 15-20 carries, and if we can
get in 20, that's great. That's how you like it. He definitely has
the attitude we like about the line of scrimmage. I really like
both of their styles.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Carroll liked Edwards's style better. There was no
question the offensive line seemed to block better for Edwards and
his hit-the-hole style than for Shaw, who looked to veer outside
more.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards took the news in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about the situation,'' said the No. 1 draft pick.
``I'm just trying to help a team win the game. I didn't know
anything about starting, but I knew I was going to play, and that's
all I can ask for.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, slowly getting back to full strength after suffering a
nagging groin injury, added, ``I think I can go out there for 20
plays and be productive.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his performance against Denver, he said, ``I thought I
did a good job. There's always going to be plays when you're not
going to gain anything, so you can't worry about that. I'm just now
catching up after being out for so long. The last game was the
first time I had a chance to show what I can do. I felt fine after
the game. I wasn't sore or anything. I felt blessed I was able to
get through a game and not be injured.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw had no comment

LITTLE DROP ON CAMPUSES IN BINGE DRINKING 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A sequel to a landmark national study of binge drinking
among college students has found that despite efforts at education
and discipline, binge drinking around campuses dropped just
slightly between 1993 and 1997, Harvard researchers said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard School of Public Health's College Alcohol Study
found in 1997 that about two out of five students _ 42.7 percent _
could be considered binge drinkers. That is, they had consumed five
drinks in a row for men, or four drinks for women, in the two weeks
before they answered the questionnaire. That proportion was down a
bit from 44.1 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also showed a slight rise in those who abstain from
drinking, from 15.6 percent in 1993 up to 19 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But at the other end of the spectrum, among heavy drinkers, it
also found an increase in those who said they not only binged but
binged frequently: they rose to 20.7 percent of the 14,521 students
in the 1997 survey from 19.5 percent of more than 15,000 students
in the 1993 sample.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disappointment is the No. 1 emotion,'' Henry Wechsler,
director of College Alcohol Studies at the Harvard School of Public
Health and principal author of the study, said in a telephone
interview about his reaction to the results. ``It may be we're not
doing enough at all levels and we've got to start thinking about
this in a broader context than simply educating students, which has
been the traditional approach.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many colleges across the country over the last several
years have tried to stem heavy student drinking, spurred in part by
an unceasing string of accidental deaths, ranging from car crashes
to alcohol poisonings, caused by drinking.
</P>
<P>
   But the study by Wechsler and his colleagues appeared to
highlight the intractable attraction that binge drinking holds for
many students, their adherence to what many see as a familiar rite
of passage. In particular, it noted that binge drinking in
fraternities and sororities, hotbeds of heavy drinking at many
colleges, did not seem to have diminished at all. In both 1993 and
1997, it found, four out of five residents of fraternities and
sororities houses were binge drinkers.
</P>
<P>
   The study surveyed 116 colleges in 39 states, using
self-administered questionnaires sent in anonymously by mail. It
was financed by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The study included a breakdown by ethnicity and found that
Asian-American students, who had a binge-drinking rate only about
half that of the general student population in 1993, had increased
their binge-drinking at an above-average rate, while whites
decreased disproportionately. Even so, only about 25 percent of
Asian-American students were found to be binge drinkers, compared
with 42.7 percent of all students surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   The findings come after years of more encouraging news, other
researchers say. Prof. Lloyd Johnston of the Institute for Social
Research at the University of Michigan said that his institute's
surveys have produced findings on college drinking similar to
Harvard's, but because it has been following college students since
1980, it can add some longer-term perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, there was a period of decline in drinking and heavy
drinking,'' he said. ``Binge drinking as we call it actually
dropped fairly steadily from the mid-'80s to the mid-'90s _ by
about one-sixth in the decade ending in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is some turnaround beginning to occur in the last
year or two,'' he said _ nothing startling, but a bit of a
``bounce-back,'' that might be a result of a lessening of attention
to the issue.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Judging by more than a dozen college students interviewed around
Boston on Wednesday, some of that rebound also seems to come from
age-old youthful feelings of immortality, an ``everybody does it,
no big deal'' attitude and a sense that even heavy drinking need
not bring serious consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``When somebody gets drunk and needs to be carried out, they may
be teased about it for a week,'' said Brett Altschul, a senior
majoring in math and physics at MIT. ``It's largely a matter of
humor, though.''
</P>
<P>
   At Boston College, Liz Russo, a junior, said she had a friend
who didn't drink at all and that she herself drank much less than
she had as a freshman. She said she had also noticed school
authorities cracking down by meting out punishment to underage
students caught hosting drinking parties in proportion to the
amount of alcohol confiscated. But in general, she said, ``It would
be very unrealistic to think drinking is just going to stop,
because it's been part of college life for so long.''
</P>
<P>
   Monica Sandoval and Doug Kahn, two Boston University sophomores,
said that five drinks in a row is typical drinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone that goes to a party does that or worse,'' Kahn said.
``If you talk to anyone college age, it's normal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we're all going to be alcoholics,'' Kahn added.
</P>
<P>
   But the Harvard researchers call binge drinking the most serious
public health hazard confronting American universities, and note
that it affects not only the drinkers themselves, who are likelier
to miss classes and fall behind in school, but also the fellow
students who are assaulted or otherwise harmed by them.
</P>
<P>
   Colleges and states have been trying a variety of new approaches
to combat binge drinking. MIT, where a freshman died of alcohol
poisoning last year in an off-campus fraternity, announced this
year that beginning in 2001, it would make all freshmen live on
campus. A task force on dangerous drinking had concluded the move
would reduce the risk for freshmen of facing heavy social pressure
to drink. Colleges in Virginia are trying a variety of techniques,
from holding discussions on binge drinking for freshmen led by the
attorney general, to printing dates of birth on student ID cards,
to ``three strikes'' policies that put a student at risk of
expulsion after three alcohol-related infractions.
</P>
<P>
   And on some campuses around the country, fraternities have even
banned liquor at their events. But Wechsler said more must be done.
Among possible additional actions, he said, would be to target
liquor retailers around campuses and encourage them not to sell
high volumes of alcohol to students. ``Colleges should be working
together with the community to work jointly on the problem,'' he
said, ``because simply squeezing the alcohol supply on campus may
result in people going off-campus.''
</P>
<P>
   But cracking down in general also tends to have unintended
consequences, students said.
</P>
<P>
   Since MIT has tried to reduce campus drinking in recent months,
said Shounak Lahiri, a graduate student, it does not seem to him
that it has actually declined. ``It's just gotten a little more
stealthy,'' he said.

DETROIT A WELCOME SIGHT FOR SLIPPING SOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A day off to collect themselves? Bret Saberhagen would
have preferred that the Red Sox didn't get a break on the schedule
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to get it back on track,'' said Saberhagen, who
faces the Detroit Tigers Friday night in the opener of a three-game
set at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just been coming up short. It's about time we come up on
the right side.''
</P>
<P>
   After losing six of their last seven and watching the Yankees
clinch the American League East title on their home turf, the Red
Sox should welcome the sight of the Tigers. While the Toronto Blue
Jays, who began the night tied with Texas 4 1/2 games behind Boston
in the wild-card race, must deal with the Yankees in New York for
four games, the Sox are facing an opponent that has lost six of its
last eight, and 12 of its last 16 on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Head to head, the Sox have won four of seven from the Tigers,
who are coming to town with nine rookies and a new manager since
the Sox last faced them _ Larry Parrish, who replaced Buddy Bell
Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   And there are reinforcements on the horizon for the Sox.
Outfielder Damon Buford, on the disabled list since Aug. 24 with a
separated rib cage, is expected to be activated for the game. And
reliever Jim Corsi, out with a strained groin since Aug. 26, is
ready to return as setup man.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're through the bad part now,'' said pitching coach Joe
Kerrigan, looking ahead to a schedule in which 10 of Boston's last
18 games will be against clubs with sub-.500 records _ Detroit, the
White Sox, and Tampa Bay _ and six more will be against the
Orioles, who are just over the break-even point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corsi will be a big boost,'' Kerrigan said. ``We've had to
overpitch some people while he's been out, so he'll be a big
help.''
</P>
<P>
   But manager Jimy Williams may be faced with a new problem if
Mike Stanley's strained right hamstring keeps him out of the lineup
for any length of time. Stanley has driven in 30 runs in 38 games
since being reacquired by the Red Sox July 31, and he has given
Williams the chance to rest Mo Vaughn at first base, making 12
starts there. Club spokesman Kevin Shea said Stanley will be
reevaluated this afternoon at the ballpark, but for now, he's day
to day.
</P>
<P>
   There is no obvious candidate to replace him at DH. One
possibility is to send out a summons to Billy Ashley, who batted
.292 in a handful of at-bats between the time Jim Leyritz was
traded to San Diego and Stanley was obtained from the Blue Jays.
But Ashley missed the last couple of weeks of Pawtucket's season
with a strained wrist, and even if healthy, he would need some time
to shake off the rust.
</P>
<P>
   Midre Cummings was activated earlier this week and has taken
some swings in batting practice, but the strained ligament in his
right wrist makes it uncertain how much he can help at the plate.
Williams thus is left to pick from a handful of players with
limited experience, including Keith Mitchell, Mandy Romero, and
rookies Jason Varitek and Trot Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox offense can hardly afford to lose a productive bat at
this time. On Aug, 26, the Red Sox' lead in the wild-card race was
nine games. Pending the outcome of Thursday night's Blue
Jays-Yankees game, the lead has been cut in half as the Sox have
gone 4-10 since.
</P>
<P>
   It's the worst extended stretch of the season. ``If it had
happened earlier in the year,'' Mo Vaughn said, ``nobody would have
even noticed it.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's happening at a time the Sox are trying to clinch their
first playoff spot in three years. Vaughn (.340) and Nomar
Garciaparra (.304) are the only regulars hitting over .300 since
Aug. 26. The team is batting just .240, and Vaughn has just six
RBIs in that stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Both players at the top of the order are sub-.200: Darren Lewis
(.145) and John Valentin (.196).
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox have had a hard time generating leads in the last
week. They led only once while being swept four straight by the
Blue Jays and led just twice in the three games against the Yankees
_ and one of those leads came on Valentin's game-winning home run
Monday night after the Sox trailed, 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see anyone pressing, stressing, or anything like
that,'' said catcher Scott Hatteberg, whose grand slam Wednesday
gave the Sox a chance after they fell behind, 5-0. ``Teams go
through things like this.''
</P>
<P>
   But the good teams, the playoff teams, don't let these things
linger. That's why Saberhagen didn't want to be sitting home
Thursday. ``I'm looking forward to this,'' he said.

</P>
<P>
   FEATURE Story
</P>
<P>
   EURO-CULTURAL-SEASON (Paris) _ In the wonderfully strict cycles
of life that make the French seem so predictable, la rentree first
announces itself each year as a reason to postpone things. From
early July, there is little that cannot await the return _ la
rentree _ to Paris in September. But, take note, this is not a
symptom of laziness. It is simply part of the French order of
things. Parisians hold parties to say goodbye for the summer in the
knowledge that social, cultural, political and business life will
resume with a vengeance a la rentree. So now, once again, Parisians
are back, hurriedly recovering control of their city from tourists,
adding frowns of impatience to still-bronzed faces, crowding
restaurants that felt no need to stay open in August to serve
foreigners. In every sense, a new season has arrived _ and all of
it meticulously linked to la rentree. By Alan Riding. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   FILM AND VIDEO
</P>
<P>
   HAPPINESS-FILM (Undated) _ At a time when the news media are
awash in the gory details of presidential sexual hijinks, the
public is supposedly beyond shock when it comes to revelations of
bad behavior. Or is it? The acid test will come with the first
public American screenings of Todd Solondz's pitch-black comedy
``Happiness,'' at the New York Film Festival. ``Happiness,'' which
will be released in theaters on Oct. 16 by Good Machine, is a
gleeful, systematic demolition of the myth of the suburban idyll.
By Stephen Holden. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   JONATHAN-MYERS-FILMS (Undated) _ Once upon a time, the talk was
of the It Girl. These days, Jonathan Rhys Meyers has filmmakers
extolling what one might call the A Boy. The A, of course, stands
for androgynous, which is one quality _ an infectious smile and raw
talent are others _ that has the 21-year-old Irishman leading the
latest Anglo-Irish thespian wave. ``Johnny's fabulous to look at,''
said Ang Lee, who cast Rhys Meyers as a long-haired
villain-with-a-difference in his Civil War film, ``Ride With the
Devil,'' which is expected to be released in the spring,
co-starring Tobey Maguire and Jewel. By Matt Wolf. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   NIVOLA-FILMS (Los Angeles) _ Few actors, however successful, can
say that they have a museum in the family, but Alessandro Nivola,
26, can boast of two: one, devoted to his grandfather, the Italian
sculptor Constantino Nivola, is situated in the artist's hometown
in Sardinia, and a second, a far more modest and decidedly
unofficial archive in Manhattan, is devoted to the actor himself.
In his next movie, ``Best Laid Plans,'' a drama starring Reese
Witherspoon and Josh Brolin that is to be released next spring, he
plays a graduate student turned con artist, and in ``I Want You,''
a forthcoming British film by Michael Winterbottom that is set in
the seaside town of Hastings, Nivola plays a paroled murderer
seeking to rekindle a forbidden love affair _ a role he researched
by spending three days in Brixton prison in South London. By
Justine Elias. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   CIVIL-ACTION-FILM (Boston) _ Nonfiction books and films always
dance cheek to cheek with real life, of course. But ``A Civil
Action,'' a Disney movie that is to open on Dec. 25, based on the
acclaimed 1995 book by Jonathan Harr, has an unusually, uncannily
intimate relationship with reality. Perhaps the most intriguing
aspect of the success of the book and potential success of the
movie is this: In their depiction of a cluster of leukemia deaths
among children in the Boston suburb of Woburn and the large-scale
1986 legal battle that ensued over whether industrial pollution was
to blame, the reality they convey is not a comfortable or a simple
one. By Carey Goldberg. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   SAM-ROCKWELL-FILMS (Undated) _ Sam Rockwell is a master of the
quick change. The 29-year-old actor showed his range in January at
the Sundance Film Festival, where he was featured in not one but
three films. He appeared as the romantic, James Dean-like outcast
who mows lawns in John Duigan's ``Lawn Dogs,'' which opened in May;
he slouched across the screen as a hilariously inept safecracker in
John Hamburg's ``Safe Men,'' which opened in July, and he delivered
a chilling performance as a car-salesman-turned-hitman in Saul
Rubinek's dark comedy ``Jerry and Tom,'' which will also be shown
this month at the Toronto Film Festival. By Laura Winters. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; DARK-COMEDY-FILMS (Undated) _ This season's writers and
directors seem to agree that disturbing material can be a laughing
matter. Several fall releases _ also including ``Very Bad Things,''
``Clay Pigeons'' and ``Home Fries'' _ are self- proclaimed dark
comedies, By Ted Loos. (Moved).
 &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BIG-CHILL-FILM (Undated) _ Quick, think back to ``The Big
Chill,'' Lawrence Kasdan's 1983 comic drama about baby-boomer
friendship and dashed idealism, with the ghost of a Kevin Costner
performance left on the cutting-room floor. What is the first scene
that comes to mind? Of course: It's when the stars _ Glenn Close,
Kevin Kline, Jeff Goldblum, William Hurt, JoBeth Williams, Mary Kay
Place and Tom Berenger _ dance around the kitchen after a raucous
meal of pasta and wine, doing Chuck Berry duckwalks and modified
boogie-downs, washing dishes to the cranked-up sound of the
Temptations' ``Ain't Too Proud to Beg.'' The scene encapsulates the
spirit of the film: friendship forged in the footloose optimism of
the 60's; camaraderie instantly regained through the nostalgic
power of good pop music. Seen these days _ and it can be in a
15th-anniversary theatrical re-release, starting Nov. 6 _ ``The Big
Chill'' should also be acknowledged as the progenitor of pop
culture phenomena both insidious and salutory. By Ken Tucker.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   PRINCE-OF-EGYPT-FILM (Undated) _ To appeal to all age groups,
goes the perceived wisdom, an animated feature must include a
musical comedy format with at least one show-stopping song, funny
and cute sidekicks to the hero or heroine, an even balance of
laughter and tears, a fairy-tale setting and a romantic narrative
thrust. In 1998, Jeffrey Katzenberg is putting finishing touches on
``The Prince of Egypt,'' the first animated feature from
Dreamworks, the studio he founded with Steven Spielberg and David
Geffen. The subject is unusual for animation: nothing less than the
epic biblical story of Moses, adapted from the first half of
Exodus. The film, in fact, defiantly goes in the opposite direction
from the now-ingrained Disney pattern in nearly every way. In ``The
Prince of Egypt,'' there is no romantic fairy-tale narrative
engine, and, taking a cue from Spielberg, action-adventure is
emphasized over humor. By John Canemaker. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   CRUISE-GUIDE-FILM (New York) _ ``The Cruise,'' a documentary,
directed by Bennett Miller, opens on Oct. 23 at the Angelika Film
Center. Throughout 1996, Miller followed Timoty (Speed) Levitch _
who was in his fifth year of leading double-decker loops of
Manhattan, first with Apple Tours, then the Gray Line _ and entered
into the extraordinary rhythm of the guide's life. By Joe Neumaier.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   WITHERSPOON-FILMS (New York) _ Chatting in a TriBeCa restaurant,
Reese Witherspoon veered from such pensive asides to moments in
which she spoke giddily, even rhapsodically, about life as a
fledgling 22-year-old movie star. In one breath, she would gush
about how exciting it was to work with Paul Newman and Susan
Sarandon in the thriller ``Twilight,'' released earlier this year,
or to act opposite her boyfriend, Ryan Phillippe, in the
forthcoming ``Cruel Intentions,'' an updating of ``Les Liaisons
Dangereuses.'' In the next, she would lament the way that the news
media glorify her profession. By Elysa Gardner. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   FRANKENHEIMER-FILMS (Los Angeles) _ With enduring films like
``Days of Wine and Roses,'' ``The Manchurian Candidate,'' ``Birdman
of Alcatraz,'' ``Seven Days in May'' and ``The Fixer'' to his
credit, John Frankenheimer was one of the foremost directors of the
1960s. But he stumbled under the weight of personal problems and
bad choices, and, starting in the 70s, his career went awry. For
filmmakers and actors who have made wrong decisions, few places are
as cruel as Hollywood. At the age of 68, with few illusions,
Frankenheimer is seeking to complete &UR;  &LR; a comeback this fall with a
large-scale action-thriller, ``Ronin,'' which opens on Sept. 25. By
Bernard Weinraub. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   NEW-FILMS-CHOICES (Undated) _ Movie directors, producers and
actors express their choices in upcoming films. By Michelle
Willens. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   MONICA-POTTER-FILMS (Los Angeles) _ Monica Potter's first brush
with success happened half a lifetime ago in her hometown,
Cleveland, when she was a 13-year-old actress in a local television
commercial. In her first movie, ``Without Limits,'' which opened
Friday, Ms. Potter, now 27, portrays the reallife character of Mary
Marckx, a devoutly Roman Catholic college student in love with the
Olympic track star Steve Prefontaine, who died in a car crash in
1975 at the age of 24. By Justine Elias. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   THEATER
</P>
<P>
   BROADWAY-SEASON (New York) _ There are a few things I am looking
forward to this season with the sort of hopes that are usually
dangerous. These are centered on three actors who, though none have
been on Broadway recently, arrive with sterling pedigrees and in
roles that would seem to fit them like wet suits. Martin Short, the
comedian of a thousand professional alter-egos, will appropriately
be playing not one but a number of roles in the Roundabout Theater
Company's revival of the 1962 musical ``Little Me'' this fall. Judi
Dench, the great English actress who recently won American hearts
as a startlingly human Queen Victoria in the movie ``Mrs. Brown,''
returns to New York this spring in David Hare's London hit ``Amy's
View.'' And Kevin Spacey, the Academy- and Tony Award-winning actor
who defies the casting director's notions of ``type,'' is also due
this spring as Eugene O'Neill's dream-smashing salesman in ``The
Iceman Cometh,'' a role he played to feverish acclaim in London. By
Ben Brantley. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   FOSSE-THEATER (Undated) _ Gwen Verdon and Ann Reinking are two
of the most respected performers to star on the American
musical-comedy stage in modern times. And Bob Fosse, the
choreographer and director, famously loved both women, as
individuals and as artists, showcasing them indelibly onstage and
on screen. Since Fosse's death in 1987 at the age of 60, Ms. Verdon
and Ms. Reinking have gone to the wall to insure that the spirit of
the man they knew would be kept vividly alive. This season, they
have collaborated as part of a team that is bringing ``Fosse: A
Celebration in Song and Dance'' to Broadway. By Mindy Aloff.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   DANCE
</P>
<P>
   EIFMAN-BALLET (Undated) _ Boris Eifman's choreography, like his
dancers, is passionate and intense: his Eifman Ballet of St.
Petersburg gave audiences a jolt when this 21-year-old Russian
troupe made its New York debut in April with provocative
psychodramas about Tchaikovsky and the ballerina Olga Spessivtseva.
When the Eifman Ballet returns to City Center Jan. 19 through 31,
it will be easier to see why Eifman's highly expressive use of the
ballet idiom is so dramatic and stunning. ``The Karamazovs,'' his
two-act treatment of Dostoyevsky's ``Brothers Karamazov'' is a
distilled if graphic essay on the novel's themes. By Anna
Kisselgoff. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   CLASSICAL MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-SERIES-SEASON (New York) _ Many of us in New York complain
yearly about pandering repertory and incoherent programs, but
solutions are arriving from every side. I hope the public responds,
because music this season is being served with a sense of adventure
unusual to the decade. The watchword is ``series,'' and there are a
lot of them: coherent looks at either individuals or ideas. By
Bernard Holland. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-EVENTS-CHOICES (Undated) _ Music directors, singers and
musicians express their choices in upcoming music events. By David
Mermelstein. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   POP MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   MORISSETTE-ALBUM (Undated) _ The aftershocks from Alanis
Morissette's ``Jagged Little Pill'' haven't subsided since the
album was released in 1995. In one pop-culture masterstroke, the
album introduced a mainstream audience to what punks, post-punks,
riot grrrls and alternative rockers had been shouting for more than
a decade: that women were angry, intelligent, carnal, sick of being
victims and ready to speak for themselves. Ms. Morissette's new
album is due for release on Nov. 3, and advance information is
scarce; she has not even revealed the album's title. By Jon
Pareles. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   NEW-POP-ALBUMS (Undated) _ Popular musicians offer their
assessment of upcoming music albums. By Dimitri Ehrlich. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   MELISSA-ELLIOTT-MUSIC (Undated) _ Melissa Elliott _ singer,
songwriter, rapper and producer _ sat before a mammoth stereo
system in the offices of her record label, Elektra. She
contemplated a pile of compact disks, digital audio tapes and
promotional videos. Which would best demonstrate where this artist,
whom the world knows by her deceptively girlish family nickname of
Missy, is headed in the wake of her emergence, at 26, as a new
ideal of womanly black power? By Ann Powers. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ART
</P>
<P>
   ARCHITECTS-SEASON (Undated) _ Money, movies, missiles, malls and
madness: the time approaches when these may be the only first-rate
items the United States will continue to turn out for international
consumption. There will be nothing but one vast continental sprawl
anchored by two buildings, one on either coast: the Pentagon, and
the new theater for the Academy Awards on Hollywood Boulevard,
which breaks ground this fall. By Herbert Muschamp. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   POLLOCK-MONET-ART (Undated) _ How specifically ``American'' were
Jackson Pollock's pictures? It's fitting that two of the big shows
this fall are the Pollock retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art
in New York City in November and the late Monet show at the Museum
of Fine Arts in Boston this month. By Michael Kimmelman. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TELEVISION
</P>
<P>
   CELEBS-TV-SHOWS (Undated) _ Television stars express their
choices in television for the fall. By Jill Gerston. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TV-FAMILY-SHOWS (Undated) _ What can it mean that the two most
enticing new series of the season are about families in distress?
You can construct theories that are high-blown (the shows reflect
the instability of the American family) or commonplace (a plot
needs some conflict). A more likely explanation is that these
series display brave satirical wit, which might explode the snuggly
confines of the domestic sitcom, that most pedestrian and
widespread of television genres. By Caryn James. (Moved).

TV NEWS EXECUTIVES FACE CONTENT DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After devoting countless hours to allegations of President
Clinton's sexual misconduct, TV news divisions face a ticklish
issue as independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr's 445-page report on
that matter is finally released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   How much detail should the networks provide in describing a
report that CNN Thursday said ``graphically details several sexual
encounters'' between Clinton and former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   As network executives, reporters, and producers made plans for
broadcasting the Starr report, the issue of sexual content
overshadowed the more basic logistical challenge the networks face
in obtaining, digesting, and airing the massive report before the
competition does. Extra producers, researchers, and reporters have
been mobilized for that task.
</P>
<P>
   Another cause of media nail-biting is the potential for a snafu
when the Starr report is posted on the Internet. Last November, an
electric cable shorted and upended a judge's plan to release on the
Internet a decision to reduce the murder conviction of British au
pair Louise Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is concern, and that is exactly the example that
everybody points to,'' said CBS spokeswoman Sandy Genelius.
</P>
<P>
   But the question of how to handle possibly salacious details in
the Starr report dominated the planning meetings at TV networks
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At CBS, Genelius said the network has decided to air warning
advisories if the network deems it ``absolutely necessary to talk
about some things that people might find distasteful.''
</P>
<P>
   At CNN, spokesman Steve Haworth called it ``a tough balancing
act'' to convey the report's contents without offending viewers.
CNN's decision, Haworth said, is ``try to avoid language that is
graphic and sexual in nature.''
</P>
<P>
   At NBC, spokeswoman Barbara Levin said: ``We will make every
effort to communicate to our viewers the relevant information in
the report while trying to stay within the bounds of good taste.''
</P>
<P>
   At ABC, where extra staffers have been moved from New York
headquarters to the Washington bureau to help on the story,
spokeswoman Eileen Murphy said the network will not ``gratuitously
use any sexually explicit material.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our standard is: What do our viewers need for them to have a
complete understanding of the story?'' said Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   John Moody, vice president of news at Fox News Channel, vowed to
avoid ``wallowing in the mud,'' noting that ``even a medically
correct description of what is alleged to have occurred in the Oval
Office is not something that many viewers want to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, Fox News plans to resort to euphemisms, where
necessary.

IRAN BLAMES TALIBAN FOR DIPLOMATS' DEATHS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ An angry Iran said Thursday night that it would
hold the militant Taliban movement responsible for the deaths of
nine Iranian diplomats whose bodies were recovered by the Taliban
on Thursday in northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban, who control most of Afghanistan, said the Iranians
had been killed by renegade forces who had acted without orders.
But Iran, which had reacted to the diplomats' disappearance with
sharp warnings and a major military buildup along the Afghan
border, appeared in no mood for swift forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   A Foreign Ministry statement broadcast on Iranian state
television said Thursday that Iran reserved ``the right to defend
the security of its citizens'' and that ``the consequences of the
Taliban action is on the shoulders of the Taliban and their
supporters.''
</P>
<P>
   The dead diplomats were among 11 Iranians posted to a consulate
in Mazar-i-Sharif, a northern town that was the headquarters of an
Iranian-backed rebel alliance until it was overrun by the Taliban
on Aug. 8. Iranian officials had accused Taliban leaders of
ordering that the consulate be captured, but had held out hope that
all of the missing diplomats might still be alive.
</P>
<P>
   With some 70,000 elite Iranian troops already posted near the
Afghan border, and plans announced earlier Thursday for more
military exercises to be carried out there over the weekend,
Tehran-based diplomats said Thursday night that tensions could turn
explosive.
</P>
<P>
   Taliban fighters were reported Thursday to be advancing on the
Afghan town of Bamiyan, the sole remaining base for two Shiite
factions that have benefited from Iranian support.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In an apparent attempt to appease Iran and its Shiite Muslim
leadership, the Taliban commander, Mullah Mohammad Omar, issued a
statement Thursday night urging his forces to treat any prisoners
of war well and ``according to the principles of Islam.''
</P>
<P>
   But that seemed unlikely to quell the deep misgivings felt
within the Iranian leadership toward the Taliban, who follow a
purist strain of Islam's dominant Sunni faith that has shown little
tolerance even for fellow Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the crisis, officials of the Taliban have repeatedly
denied responsibility for the Iranians' fate. By the time their
forces reached the center of Mazar-i-Sharif, the Taliban officials
have said, the Iranian Embassy was empty.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing Thursday night that the diplomats' bodies had been
found, a Taliban spokesman quoted by the Afghan Islamic Press said
that they had been recovered at a mountain near Mazar-i-Sharif,
which remains in Taliban control.
</P>
<P>
   (A Taliban commission set up to investigate the disappearance of
the Iranian diplomats is to issue a full report within a week, said
Abdul Hakim Mujahid, the Taliban's ambassador to Pakistan, who has
been designated as their representative at the United Nations,
where the opposition still holds a seat.
</P>
<P>
   (In a telephone interview from Islamabad, Mujahid said that
after the Taliban found the bodies, it asked Pakistan and the
United Nations to intercede with the Iranians and ask them to send
a team to Mazar-i-Sharif so that they could see for themselves the
circumstances under which the diplomats had died.
</P>
<P>
   (At the United Nations in New York, Iran asked the Security
Council on Thursday to take ``urgent and necessary measures'' in
response to the killing of its diplomats.)
</P>
<P>
   The Foreign Ministry statement broadcast Thursday night on
Iranian state television referred to the dead diplomats as
``martyrs,'' and compared them with Iranians who had died
``defending the borders of this great country during eight years of
holy defense'' during Iran's 1980-88 war with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The statement called on the Taliban to return the bodies of the
dead Iranians immediately to Iran, and to arrest those who carried
out the attack. And in addition to the Taliban forces, it said it
held the government of Pakistan, which has close ties to the
Taliban, partially responsible for the attack.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the attack, Pakistani diplomats had relayed to
Tehran an assurance from the Taliban that the safety of the Iranian
consulates and diplomats in Mazar-i-Sharif would be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranian Foreign Ministry statement also called on the
Taliban to hand over Iranian ``hostages'' who it said were still
being held in Afghanistan. That was an apparent reference to the
remaining two Iranian diplomats and a journalist from the Islamic
Republic News Agency, whose fate the Taliban has said it has been
unable to determine, as well as to nearly three dozen other
Iranians whom Taliban officials have said may well be in Taliban
custody.
</P>
<P>
   For the last month, Iran has cast its tough stance toward the
Taliban as motivated primarily by concern about several dozen
Iranians missing in Afghanistan, including the 11 diplomats. But
some Tehran-based diplomats have said that the scale of Iran's
military posturing has suggested that its concern runs deeper than
the missing Iranians' fate _ and might not be resolved even if
questions about them were resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomats have said that Iran, a Shiite Muslim state, is
plainly troubled at the prospect that such an ideological rival
could soon sit unchallenged on its borders.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Thursday night whether Iran had decided to
dispatch additional forces to the border area. A report in the
influential Tehran Times newspaper this morning quoted an unnamed
senior military official as saying that several divisions from
Iran's regular army would soon be moved to the region to join the
70,000 elite troops from Iran's Revolutionary Guards already in
place.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday's announcement on Iranian state television said
only that war games involving ``commandos, special forces, armored
artillery, and mechanized units backed by the air force and the
army's air corps'' would begin soon along the Afghan border. It did
not say whether the exercises would involve fresh contingents of
Iranian troops.

REPORT SEES INCREASE IN BINGE DRINKING BY COLLEGE STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   College students who drink are drinking more heavily, and more
often with the intention of getting drunk, a national study on
campus drinking released Thursday found.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Henry Wechsler of the Harvard School of Public Health headed
the survey of 14,521 students at 116 colleges and universities, a
follow-up to his 1993 landmark study documenting binge drinking on
college campuses.
</P>
<P>
   While the study notes a small increase in the number of students
who abstain, and a slight decrease in the number of students who
binge drink, what its authors find most alarming is that students
who do binge drink are doing so more frequently. The researchers
define binge drinking as five drinks at a time for males, four for
females.
</P>
<P>
   The study also revealed a 33 percent increase in the students
who say they drink with the specific purpose of getting drunk. In
1993, 39.4 percent of drinking students said they drank to get
drunk; in 1997, it was 52.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Wechsler said he had hoped the number of students who binge
drink would decrease substantially because of increased efforts on
campuses to curb drinking. In his 1997 survey, 42.7 percent of the
students said they were binge drinkers, down from 44.1 percent in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's barely changed,'' Wechsler said. ``Frankly, I'm
disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 34 students died on campuses after drinking
excessively. The highly publicized death of Massachusetts Institute
of Technology freshman Scott Krueger _ who died of alcohol
poisoning after attending an MIT fraternity party last year _ put a
spotlight on the disturbing trend.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two weeks, two women filed separate lawsuits against
Boston University and MIT. Both said they were raped after being
served liquor at fraternity parties, even though they were under
the legal drinking age.
</P>
<P>
   College administrators across the country are grappling with
ways to curb drinking on campus. ``There's no simple solution to
this,'' Wechsler said. ``Alcohol has been a part of American
society for a long time and it will continue to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say it's unclear why binge drinking is increasing
among campus drinkers. They said students who drink to excess are
more likely to argue with friends, get injured, not use protection
while having sex, damage property, get in trouble with police, and
drive while drinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's interesting is if you ask them if they have problems,
they say no,'' Wechsler said. ``They will tell you, `I can handle
10 drinks.' They consider themselves moderate drinkers.''
</P>
<P>
   Students interviewed Thursday reflected that view. Robert
Andersen, &UR;  &LR; a freshman at Wentworth Institute of Technology in
Boston, said, ``To tell you the truth, I love drinking.'' Andersen,
18, said he started drinking in high school and did it every
weekend ``to get that feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he'll continue drinking all his life, and though he
admits he sometimes gets ``wasted,'' he considers himself a social
drinker.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're drunk, you talk to more people,'' he said. His
friend and roommate, John Park, 19, also a Wentworth freshman,
said, ``My opinion is as long as you make the grade, do what you
want.''
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Wood, a 19-year-old sophomore at Northeastern University
in Boston, said, ``If I'm playing a drinking game and I feel my
limit has passed, I stop.''
</P>
<P>
   She said people who binge drink often probably have more
personal problems. But for her, drinking a few beers is fine.
``I'll throw back a few,'' she said. ``It's not like every weekend
I'm getting trashed.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood doubts college administrators will be able to get rid of
binge drinking on campuses. ``If anything, people will hide more,''
she said. ``It's not going to stop. The only thing that's going to
make you stop drinking is you.''

 &HT;    POSTING OF STARR REPORT WILL CAUSE WEB TRAFFIC JAMS
 &HT;    By FRANCES KATZ and MARY BETH REGAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Internet users can expect long delays at government
and private Internet sites that post Independent Counsel Ken
Starr's report Friday, but experts said they do not expect a Web
``meltdown.''
</P>
<P>
   The Thomas site at the Library of Congress
(http://www.thomas.loc.gov/icreport) is one of two government sites
designated to receive the report after it is released by the House
on Friday. The other is a page on the House of Representatives Web
site (http://www.house.gov/icreport).
</P>
<P>
   The posting will be historic because such an important document
has never before been released to the public on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been one of the innovations of this majority that we
made in 1995 that we make as much of the proceedings of the House
availble to the public as quickly as possible,'' said House
Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be millions of Americans familiarizing themselves
with computers this weekend,'' said Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Web measurement firm Relevant Knowledge says the
report is expected to boost traffic to most major online news
sites, along with Thomas and the House site.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've seen historically, specifically when Princess Diana
died, the British monarchy's Web site got a lot of traffic which we
never saw them get until that happened,'' said spokeswoman Michelle
Beilsmith. ``August was a tremendous news month, with the Clinton
televised apology and the bombings.''
</P>
<P>
   But she pointed out that while overall traffic was up, the
average duration of individual visits and average pages views
dropped. ``People were going to find specific news, getting that
news and leaving the sites,'' she says. ``More people were logging
on, but they weren't staying as long as an average user on an
average day.''
</P>
<P>
   People seeking the report ``will slow things down,'' said Doug
McFarland, senior vice president and general manager of Media
Metrix(cq), a New York-based online monitoring firm. But because of
technical tricks that will ease the pressure on the government
sites, ``I don't think that it's going to smash them.''
</P>
<P>
   In a matter of hours after House Speaker Newt Gingrich said
Thursday that Thomas would be the likely place for Congress to post
the report or sections of the 445-page report, Thomas was already
buckling under the weight of increased traffic from mainstream Web
surfers and news junkies.
</P>
<P>
   The Library of Congress site that contains Thomas consists of 14
linked IBM servers. It averages 1 million hits a day, said Guy
Lamolinara, a spokesman for the Library, but was getting 40 hits a
second late this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The library was not sure how quickly it would be able to post
the Starr report on Friday, Lamolinara said. Webmasters were even
unsure Thursday afternoon whether they would receive the
information in electronic form or on paper , he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a normal situation,'' Lamolinara said. ``We're not
certain what form it's coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday afternoon, Thomas had replaced its home page with
a simple white easy-to-load page explaining that the report is not
yet on the site and probably won't be until late Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's early warning alert gives Thomas a bit of breathing
room to accommodate how it will handle volumes of traffic typically
seen by brand-name consumer news sites. But it's clear they're
going to need some help from the major news organizations and Web
sites that are built to handle this kind of traffic and can post
some or all of the document to ease some of the traffic to the
Thomas site.
</P>
<P>
   The big news sites such as CNN, which are used to nearly
record-breaking traffic on big news days, are already retooling,
refining and getting their Web sites ready to handle the traffic
from the United States and around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're already working with people in the government to get the
document on line'' said CNN.com spokesman Kerrin Roberts, who also
predicted record traffic. ``We are expecting high volume, and our
repeat users will continually be returning to the site to check it.
So we are braced for the breaking news whenever it happens, with
our stripped-down home page for easy user access.''
</P>
<P>
   ABCNews.com spokeswoman Michelle Bergman said the ``plan of the
moment at ABCNews is to post only pieces of the report. ``As we
understand it, the full report will be on the federal Web site and
we will provide a link to that site. We have to be flexible,''
Bergman said, ``but our plan right now is to post selections that
will give our users the full feel of the document and post relevant
links as part of our coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Wired News (http://www.wirednews,com) and MSNBC.com will also
publish the report as soon as it becomes publicly available.
</P>
<P>
   One technical trick that large sites will use to speed users'
access is ``caching'' the report.
</P>
<P>
   America Online spokeswoman Pam McGraw said that if the
government posts the report, ''We will point to the Web site and
cache the report, essentially take a copy of it so it can reside on
our servers so we can make it available to our members.
</P>
<P>
   ''The caching will help take the load off the government Web
site. We don't know how many servers they have whereas we have
football fields of servers that carry our content. We also have a
chat event that takes place at 4 p.m. , The site will be linked off
the main screen so members can find it right away.''
</P>
<P>
   While some Democratic members of Congress questioned the rapid
release of the report on grounds of fairness to President Clinton,
one Republican raised a different ethics concern.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., said he questioned Judiciary Committee
Chairman Henry Hyde about whether putting the Starr report on the
Internet would violate the spirit of a bill that recently passed
the House banning pornography on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde indicated that was a concern since some aspects of the
Starr report ``could be of such a graphic nature,'' as to violate
the intent of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Although official government documents would not be subject to
laws against pornography, Foley said there would be an appearance
of a conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers also were concerned that people not connected with the
scandal may be mentioned in some of the grand jury testimony or
other documents, Foley said, indicating that Gingrich was siding
with those who wanted to delete such names.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are still some things that need to be resolved''
before the report is made public, he said.

 &HT;    POSTING OF STARR REPORT WILL CAUSE WEB TRAFFIC JAMS
 &HT;    By FRANCES KATZ and MARY BETH REGAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Internet users can expect long delays at government
and private Internet sites that post Independent Counsel Ken
Starr's report Friday, but experts said they do not expect a Web
``meltdown.''
</P>
<P>
   The Thomas site at the Library of Congress
(http://www.thomas.loc.gov/icreport) is one of two government sites
designated to receive the report after it is released by the House
on Friday. The other is a page on the House of Representatives Web
site (http://www.house.gov/icreport).
</P>
<P>
   The posting will be historic because such an important document
has never before been released to the public on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been one of the innovations of this majority that we
made in 1995 that we make as much of the proceedings of the House
availble to the public as quickly as possible,'' said House
Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be millions of Americans familiarizing themselves
with computers this weekend,'' said Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Web measurement firm Relevant Knowledge says the
report is expected to boost traffic to most major online news
sites, along with Thomas and the House site.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've seen historically, specifically when Princess Diana
died, the British monarchy's Web site got a lot of traffic which we
never saw them get until that happened,'' said spokeswoman Michelle
Beilsmith. ``August was a tremendous news month, with the Clinton
televised apology and the bombings.''
</P>
<P>
   But she pointed out that while overall traffic was up, the
average duration of individual visits and average pages views
dropped. ``People were going to find specific news, getting that
news and leaving the sites,'' she says. ``More people were logging
on, but they weren't staying as long as an average user on an
average day.''
</P>
<P>
   People seeking the report ``will slow things down,'' said Doug
McFarland, senior vice president and general manager of Media
Metrix(cq), a New York-based online monitoring firm. But because of
technical tricks that will ease the pressure on the government
sites, ``I don't think that it's going to smash them.''
</P>
<P>
   In a matter of hours after House Speaker Newt Gingrich said
Thursday that Thomas would be the likely place for Congress to post
the report or sections of the 445-page report, Thomas was already
buckling under the weight of increased traffic from mainstream Web
surfers and news junkies.
</P>
<P>
   The Library of Congress site that contains Thomas consists of 14
linked IBM servers. It averages 1 million hits a day, said Guy
Lamolinara, a spokesman for the Library, but was getting 40 hits a
second late this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The library was not sure how quickly it would be able to post
the Starr report on Friday, Lamolinara said. Webmasters were even
unsure Thursday afternoon whether they would receive the
information in electronic form or on paper , he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a normal situation,'' Lamolinara said. ``We're not
certain what form it's coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday afternoon, Thomas had replaced its home page with
a simple white easy-to-load page explaining that the report is not
yet on the site and probably won't be until late Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's early warning alert gives Thomas a bit of breathing
room to accommodate how it will handle volumes of traffic typically
seen by brand-name consumer news sites. But it's clear they're
going to need some help from the major news organizations and Web
sites that are built to handle this kind of traffic and can post
some or all of the document to ease some of the traffic to the
Thomas site.
</P>
<P>
   The big news sites such as CNN, which are used to nearly
record-breaking traffic on big news days, are already retooling,
refining and getting their Web sites ready to handle the traffic
from the United States and around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're already working with people in the government to get the
document on line'' said CNN.com spokesman Kerrin Roberts, who also
predicted record traffic. ``We are expecting high volume, and our
repeat users will continually be returning to the site to check it.
So we are braced for the breaking news whenever it happens, with
our stripped-down home page for easy user access.''
</P>
<P>
   ABCNews.com spokeswoman Michelle Bergman said the ``plan of the
moment at ABCNews is to post only pieces of the report. ``As we
understand it, the full report will be on the federal Web site and
we will provide a link to that site. We have to be flexible,''
Bergman said, ``but our plan right now is to post selections that
will give our users the full feel of the document and post relevant
links as part of our coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Wired News (http://www.wirednews,com) and MSNBC.com will also
publish the report as soon as it becomes publicly available.
</P>
<P>
   One technical trick that large sites will use to speed users'
access is ``caching'' the report.
</P>
<P>
   America Online spokeswoman Pam McGraw said that if the
government posts the report, ''We will point to the Web site and
cache the report, essentially take a copy of it so it can reside on
our servers so we can make it available to our members.
</P>
<P>
   ''The caching will help take the load off the government Web
site. We don't know how many servers they have whereas we have
football fields of servers that carry our content. We also have a
chat event that takes place at 4 p.m. , The site will be linked off
the main screen so members can find it right away.''
</P>
<P>
   While some Democratic members of Congress questioned the rapid
release of the report on grounds of fairness to President Clinton,
one Republican raised a different ethics concern.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., said he questioned Judiciary Committee
Chairman Henry Hyde about whether putting the Starr report on the
Internet would violate the spirit of a bill that recently passed

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A sequel to a landmark national study of binge drinking
among college students has found that despite efforts at education
and discipline, binge drinking around campuses dropped just
slightly between 1993 and 1997, Harvard researchers said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard School of Public Health's College Alcohol Study
found in 1997 that about two out of five students _ 42.7 percent _
could be considered binge drinkers. That is, they had consumed five
drinks in a row for men, or four drinks for women, in the two weeks
before they answered the questionnaire. That proportion was down a
bit from 44.1 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also showed a slight rise in those who abstain from
drinking, from 15.6 percent in 1993 up to 19 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But at the other end of the spectrum, among heavy drinkers, it
also found an increase in those who said they not only binged but
binged frequently: they rose to 20.7 percent of the 14,521 students
in the 1997 survey from 19.5 percent of more than 15,000 students
in the 1993 sample.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disappointment is the No. 1 emotion,'' Henry Wechsler,
director of College Alcohol Studies at the Harvard School of Public
Health and principal author of the study, said in a telephone
interview about his reaction to the results. ``It may be we're not
doing enough at all levels and we've got to start thinking about
this in a broader context than simply educating students, which has
been the traditional approach.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many colleges across the country over the last several
years have tried to stem heavy student drinking, spurred in part by
an unceasing string of accidental deaths, ranging from car crashes
to alcohol poisonings, caused by drinking.
</P>
<P>
   But the study by Wechsler and his colleagues appeared to
highlight the intractable attraction that binge drinking holds for
many students, their adherence to what many see as a familiar rite
of passage. In particular, it noted that binge drinking in
fraternities and sororities, hotbeds of heavy drinking at many
colleges, did not seem to have diminished at all. In both 1993 and
1997, it found, four out of five residents of fraternities and
sororities houses were binge drinkers.
</P>
<P>
   The study surveyed 116 colleges in 39 states, using
self-administered questionnaires sent in anonymously by mail. It
was financed by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The study included a breakdown by ethnicity and found that
Asian-American students, who had a binge-drinking rate only about
half that of the general student population in 1993, had increased
their binge-drinking at an above-average rate, while whites
decreased disproportionately. Even so, only about 25 percent of
Asian-American students were found to be binge drinkers, compared
with 42.7 percent of all students surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   The findings come after years of more encouraging news, other
researchers say. Prof. Lloyd Johnston of the Institute for Social
Research at the University of Michigan said that his institute's
surveys have produced findings on college drinking similar to
Harvard's, but because it has been following college students since
1980, it can add some longer-term perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, there was a period of decline in drinking and heavy
drinking,'' he said. ``Binge drinking as we call it actually
dropped fairly steadily from the mid-'80s to the mid-'90s _ by
about one-sixth in the decade ending in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is some turnaround beginning to occur in the last
year or two,'' he said _ nothing startling, but a bit of a
``bounce-back,'' that might be a result of a lessening of attention
to the issue.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Judging by more than a dozen college students interviewed around
Boston on Wednesday, some of that rebound also seems to come from
age-old youthful feelings of immortality, an ``everybody does it,
no big deal'' attitude and a sense that even heavy drinking need
not bring serious consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``When somebody gets drunk and needs to be carried out, they may
be teased about it for a week,'' said Brett Altschul, a senior
majoring in math and physics at MIT. ``It's largely a matter of
humor, though.''
</P>
<P>
   At Boston College, Liz Russo, a junior, said she had a friend
who didn't drink at all and that she herself drank much less than
she had as a freshman. She said she had also noticed school
authorities cracking down by meting out punishment to underage
students caught hosting drinking parties in proportion to the
amount of alcohol confiscated. But in general, she said, ``It would
be very unrealistic to think drinking is just going to stop,
because it's been part of college life for so long.''
</P>
<P>
   Monica Sandoval and Doug Kahn, two Boston University sophomores,
said that five drinks in a row is typical drinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone that goes to a party does that or worse,'' Kahn said.
``If you talk to anyone college age, it's normal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we're all going to be alcoholics,'' Kahn added.
</P>
<P>
   But the Harvard researchers call binge drinking the most serious
public health hazard confronting American universities, and note
that it affects not only the drinkers themselves, who are likelier
to miss classes and fall behind in school, but also the fellow
students who are assaulted or otherwise harmed by them.
</P>
<P>
   Colleges and states have been trying a variety of new approaches
to combat binge drinking. MIT, where a freshman died of alcohol
poisoning last year in an off-campus fraternity, announced this
year that beginning in 2001, it would make all freshmen live on
campus. A task force on dangerous drinking had concluded the move
would reduce the risk for freshmen of facing heavy social pressure
to drink. Colleges in Virginia are trying a variety of techniques,
from holding discussions on binge drinking for freshmen led by the
attorney general, to printing dates of birth on student ID cards,
to ``three strikes'' policies that put a student at risk of
expulsion after three alcohol-related infractions.
</P>
<P>
   And on some campuses around the country, fraternities have even
banned liquor at their events. But Wechsler said more must be done.
Among possible additional actions, he said, would be to target
liquor retailers around campuses and encourage them not to sell
high volumes of alcohol to students. ``Colleges should be working
together with the community to work jointly on the problem,'' he
said, ``because simply squeezing the alcohol supply on campus may
result in people going off-campus.''
</P>
<P>
   But cracking down in general also tends to have unintended
consequences, students said.
</P>
<P>
   Since MIT has tried to reduce campus drinking in recent months,
said Shounak Lahiri, a graduate student, it does not seem to him
that it has actually declined. ``It's just gotten a little more
stealthy,'' he said.

WHITE HOUSE WELCOMES NOMINATION OF PRIMAKOV 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also RUSSIA-RDP, RUSSIA-PRIMAKOV) 
(mk) 
 By PHILIP SHENON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration Thursday welcomed the
nomination of Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov as Russia's next
prime minister, with American officials describing him as a
sure-footed survivor whose appointment could help defuse a
political and economic crisis that had threatened to bring down
President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously the United States knows and respects the foreign
minister, Primakov,'' said Mike McCurry, the White House spokesman.
``We've worked closely with him. If ratified by the Duma, we would
expect to have a good and close working relationship with Prime
Minister Primakov.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Primakov has often worked at cross purposes with the
United States, notably concerning the Balkans and the Middle East,
Clinton administration officials said they found him a reliable
partner on a variety of other issues. He helped negotiate the
agreement that resulted last year in Moscow's acquiescence to an
expansion of the NATO alliance eastward toward Russia's borders.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright phoned Primakov to
congratulate him on the nomination. ``They had a very warm and
friendly discussion,'' said James Rubin, her chief spokesman.
``Prime Minister-designate Primakov is well known to Secretary
Albright and many of us at the department, and he enjoys
considerable respect.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Albright considered Primakov to be ``a skillful,
dedicated and effective advocate of what he understands to be the
Russian national interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior administration officials said that while there was
concern here over Primakov's lack of experience in economic policy,
there was relief over the prospect that his nomination might
restore stability to the leadership of the Russian government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Primakov is a known commodity to Washington, a familiar face
who inspires confidence,'' a White House official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``And I'm sure he understands that in the
midst of the economic crisis, he'll need to find advisers who have
the background in economics and finance that he lacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Primakov and Albright had developed such a rapport that they
agreed to serenade each other in a skit performed during a banquet
at the end of a meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations in July. In the skit, they played star-crossed lovers in a
parody of the Leonard Bernstein musical ``West Side Story.''

   WASHINGTON_The U.S. Constitution makes the House of
Representatives a grand jury and the Senate a trial court for
impeachment proceedings, but it does not spell out how each body
should handle its responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   The process involving President Clinton is under the control of
House Speaker Newt Gingrich and other Republican leaders. Due to
the unique nature of the allegations against Clinton, some Congress
members are recommending that the House forgo impeachment
proceedings and instead approve a resolution of censure, a
political statement without legal effect.
</P>
<P>
   But if historical precedents are followed, potential impeachment
proceedings would go like this:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The 1978 independent counsel law states that Kenneth Starr
must tell the House about ``any substantial and credible
information ... that may constitute grounds for an impeachment.''
In the past, petitions, requests from prosecutors and resolutions
by House members also have sparked impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The independent counsel's report is sent to the House
Judiciary Committee or a specially appointed committee to decide
whether to begin impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The committee can decide to do nothing. Or it can accept the
findings of the report as is, or conduct its own investigation and
hold hearings on the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If the committee finds any allegations credible, it sends a
resolution of impeachment and articles of impeachment _ that is, a
list of the specific charges _ to the House floor for a vote.

POLLS SHOW GOP GAINS IN NORTHEAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Just as the independent counsel's report was being
delivered to Congress on Wednesday, Republican pollsters were
receiving some startling poll results. The surveys completed the
same day showed a 17-point shift toward the GOP in the Northeast
since July, possibly foretelling a dramatic turn in this November's
congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   Few pollsters in either party are predicting anything like the
Republican tidal wave that swept over Congress in 1994. But the
Democratic optimism of earlier this year, when the party believed
it could take over the House, has turned into a full-scale retreat
from President Clinton's actions in the Monica S. Lewinsky case.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, if congressional races are viewed on the usual
case-by-case basis, it appears most incumbents will be reelected
and Republicans may pick up a handful of seats in the House and
Senate. But analysts interviewed Thursday said there is nothing
usual about running for election just weeks after the release of a
report that describes how the president committed a series of
potentially impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the best-case scenario for Democrats is that Clinton
resigns in the next two weeks and (Vice President Al) Gore is in
and there is a euphoric thing about healing,'' said Charles Cook,
one of the nation's top congressional campaign observers. ``The
worst case is Clinton is dug in on a goal line defense on Election
Day.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign results could take on even greater importance if
Clinton stays in office and the House tires to impeach him after
the election. A larger Republican majority could increase the
chances that the House will approve articles of impeachment, which
requires a simple majority vote.
</P>
<P>
   Then, it would take a two-thirds vote in the Senate to convict
and oust Clinton, meaning 67 votes if all 100 senators are present.
Even the most optimistic Republicans are predicting the GOP could
increase its Senate control from the current 55 seats only to as
many as 62, meaning some Democrats would have to join with the GOP
if Clinton is to be convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts said the Democratic mood shifted noticeably
after Clinton gave his poorly received national admission on Aug.
17 that he had an inappropriate relationship with Lewinsky. The
analysts said the Democratic mood darkened further when two of
Clinton's closest allies, Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut
and Senator Barbara Boxer of California, said the president had
acted in an ``immoral'' way. Boxer is running for reelection in a
race rated a tossup by many analysts.
</P>
<P>
   All of this provided the Republicans with just the opening they
have been seeking, enabling them to run on the ``values'' issue
even if they don't attack Clinton or mention Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans hold a 55-45 margin in the Senate and a 228-206 lead
in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Bolger, a Republican pollster, said he thinks the
president's troubles will cost Democrats two to four points
nationally in the fall campaign. Prior to Clinton's Aug. 17 speech,
Bolger figured Republicans would gain no more than three Senate
seats and would gain or lose five House seats. Now he thinks
Republicans will pick up three to five Senate seats and gain 10 to
12 House seats.
</P>
<P>
   Linda DiVall, another Republican pollster, is the one who found
the 17-point shift in the Northeast toward the GOP in her American
Viewpoint poll completed Wednesday. In the polls, those surveyed
were asked the generic question of whether they preferred the
Democrat or Republican in Congress, with no specific candidates
mentioned. In July, the survey found Democrats leading Republican
by a 40-27 percent margin. But the new poll found Republicans
leading by a 39-35 percent margin.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the July poll was much closer, with Democrats ahead
by 37 to 36 percent, while the new poll shows Republicans ahead 40
to 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton's numbers are in a downward spiral...the Democratic
base is disenchanted,'' DiVall said.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats, many of whom have called Clinton's behavior
indefensible, said they see no reason why the rest of the party
should be hurt by the president's actions with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe that individual members will be judged on
their own,'' said Representative Martin Meehan, the Massachusetts
Democrat. ``The president's behavior doesn't reflect on other
members.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Party chairman Steve Grossman said it is difficult to
predict what will happen given the ``uncertain and tumultuous''
atmosphere but said he expects to ``prove the pundits wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have to say I have heard a lot of questions in the
last week,'' Grossman said. ``I have not found anybody who has any
real answers.'' He said the latest polls are ``are snapshots in
time...that are grossly inaccurate,'' predicting that Democrats
will do well with a good turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, House races, as well as many Senate campaigns, usually
are decided on local issues, not national ones.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``X factor'' in this campaign, analysts said, is that
the Clinton scandal could dramatically boost Republican turnout and
depress the Democratic vote. That could throw a national dynamic
into local races that ``could cause the bottom to drop out'' for
Democrats, Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, unlike some other mid-year elections, there is no
other overriding national issue on which voters are focusing,
pollsters said. The economy is relatively strong, although the
recent market downturn could begin to affect races if things get
significantly worse. While Democrats are trying to focus attention
on health care and other issues, analysts said no issue other than
Clinton's predicament has dominated the national conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recent scandals have drowned out the Democrats' dialogue
on issues,'' Democratic pollster Celinda Lake said in a statement
earlier this week upon the release of the ``Battleground '98 poll,
which she conducted jointly with Republican pollsters. ``Democrats
must shift the agenda to powerful contrasts between the two parties
on HMOs, education and Social Security, which work to the
Democrats' advantage.''

2 STARR AIDES DID MUCH OF REPORT'S WRITING AND EDITING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Md., Texas)  (bl) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The voluminous report by Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr to be publicly released Friday is the product of more
than a half-dozen authors, lawyers at Starr's office said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But those lawyers also said that much of the editing and writing
was done by two people in the office, Brett Kavanaugh and Stephen
Bates.
</P>
<P>
   If Kavanaugh is a kind of Starr protege, as he has been
described, Bates may be thought of as someone whose origins and
manner are modeled after Starr. Bates, like Starr, grew up in a
small town in North Texas, ``way out near nowhere'' a friend said.
Also like Starr, he is known for his low-key and courteous
demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   Bates graduated from Harvard College and Harvard Law School but
was adamant that he earn his living as a writer and not as a
lawyer, several friends said.
</P>
<P>
   The 40-year-old Bates is actually a part-time employee of the
independent counsel's office and maintains another part-time job as
literary editor of The Wilson Quarterly, the publication of the
Wilson Center, which is affiliated with the Smithsonian
Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Bates has written for publications as diverse as The Nation, The
Weekly Standard and Playboy.
</P>
<P>
   Abigail Thernstrom, who first met Bates when she was a lecturer
at Harvard and he was in her constitutional seminar for freshmen,
indicated in an interview Thursday that Bates was relatively
unsophisticated when he arrived in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thernstrom, who has maintained a friendship with Bates for
more than 20 years, also said that he was not a particularly
political person.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did not fit the profile of a conservative ideologue in any
way,'' she said. Ms. Thernstrom noted that during his years at
Harvard Law School, Bates did not belong to the Federalist Society,
a group favored by conservative law students for its philosophy and
opportunities for networking with like-minded people. Ms.
Thernstrom described him as a brilliant writer who is low-key, even
offering his views with ``almost a diffidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Kavanaugh, at 33, is one of the youngest members of the
independent counsel's legal team. Nonetheless, he has been
entrusted by Starr with some of the office's most erudite legal
issues, notably dealing with White House efforts to invoke a
variety of privileges to block testimony.
</P>
<P>
   He is a native of the Washington area; his mother is a Maryland
state judge and his father is a lobbyist for the cosmetics
industry. After graduating from Yale College and the Yale Law
School, he first worked for Starr in his last year as solicitor
general.
</P>
<P>
   After joining the independent counsel's office, Kavanaugh led
the investigation into the death of Vincent Foster, a deputy White
House counsel who killed himself in July 1993. Kavanaugh left the
office in 1997 but this spring returned to handle an appeal to the
Supreme Court on an issue that became known as ``postmortem
privilege.'' In that case, he argued and lost a request by the
independent counsel for access to notes taken by Foster's lawyer,
contending that the lawyer-client privilege ended with death.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The drop in stock prices accelerated Thursday as
worries increased about the Clinton presidency and the global
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 249.48 points, or 3.17
percent, to 7,615.54. The blue-chip gauge has fallen 18.4 percent
since its July 17 peak of 9,337.97, nearing the 20 percent figure
designating a bear market. The Dow, however, is 76.47 points above
its low for the year, 7,539.07, reached on Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks skidded even more sharply abroad. In Latin America, the
Brazilian stock market index declined 15.8 percent; the Mexican
market dropped 9.8 percent; the Argentinian index slipped 13.3
percent and the Chilean exchange fell 7.4 percent. In Europe,
indexes lost 4.32 in Germany, 3.29 percent in London and 4.59
percent in France. Declines in the Far East were modest, with
Japan's Nikkei index of 225 issues down 0.6 percent and Hong Kong's
Hang Seng lower by 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have wall-to-wall worries,'' said Alan Ackerman, chief
market strategist of Fahnestock &AMP; Co. ``The market is replete with
uncertainties.''
</P>
<P>
   While analysts said Kenneth Starr's report on President Clinton,
which the independent counsel sent to Congress Wednesday, sent
stocks plunging, they continued to identify withering earnings as
the real cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've pinpointed this on Clinton, but the old overseas
problems haven't gone away,'' said Larry Rice, chief investment
officer at Josephthal &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Citicorp, for example, is estimated to have $39 billion in loans
to Latin America, which is increasingly being affected by
convulsions in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring concerns about profit, IBES International Inc.
calculated that the companies comprising the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index will achieve no earnings growth during the current
quarter, the weakest performance since the fourth quarter of 1991
when the economy was emerging from the most recent recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at zero growth right now,'' said Joseph Abbott,
stock strategist for the New York firm that tracks analysts'
earnings estimates. And with future deterioration, he said, ``it is
very likely that earnings for the quarter will be down.''
</P>
<P>
   When the quarter began, in early July analysts expected an 8
percent earnings gain; by Wednesday this had been reduced to 0.4
percent, Abbott said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are also growing concerned that a weak stock market may
soon not just reflect assorted economic instabilities but aggravate
them as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given their pervasive influence on consumer and business
investment decisions, stock prices may hold the key to the
outlook'' for the nation's economy, David Hensley of Salomon Smith
Barney wrote in a recent analysis for clients. ``A major new plunge
in equities,'' he added, could help ``undermine'' the 7{-year-old
business expansion.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Thursday the Standard &AMP; Poor index skidded 26.01 points, or 2.58
percent, to 980.19, while the Nasdaq composite index fell 39.22
points, or 2.42 percent, to 1,585.33.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the carnage _ $2.4 trillion of American stock market
wealth erased since mid-July _ investors in mutual funds seem to
have maintained some confidence, at least until the latest two
sessions of sharp declines. Several fund companies reported that
investors withdrew money from equity funds last month but that so
far in September they have begun to creep back in.
</P>
<P>
   This can partly be attributed to the presence of 401(k) and
other retirement programs, which tend to discourage employees from
impulsive shifts of money they have been channeling into the market
through payroll deductions.
</P>
<P>
   At the Vanguard Group, the pace of calls from concerned
investors has slowed this week from the higher-than-normal rate of
the preceding two weeks, said John Woerth, a spokesman. So far this
month, new cash is still flowing into equity funds but at what he
called ``a slower pace'' as investors earmark more new money for
money market funds.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity Investments has seen ``some very small movement of
money from equities to money market and bond funds'' so far this
month, similar to what happened in August, said Jessica Johnson, a
spokeswoman for the Boston-based fund giant.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual Fund Trim Tabs, which also tracks fund cash flows, said
that in the first eight days of September, investors had bought
stock funds, contributing roughly $2.4 billion to American stock
funds, while withdrawing about $1.2 billion from international
stock funds. In August, Trim Tabs estimates that domestic stock
funds lost $1 billion to investor withdrawals, while international
stock funds saw $4.4 billion of redemptions.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those recent contributions might have come from 401(k)
investors, as well, because many programs transfer money from
investors to the fund companies once per month, usually around the
first of the month.

TV NEWS EXECUTIVES FACE CONTENT DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After devoting countless hours to allegations of President
Clinton's sexual misconduct, TV news divisions face a ticklish
issue as independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr's 445-page report on
that matter is finally released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   How much detail should the networks provide in describing a
report that CNN Thursday said ``graphically details several sexual
encounters'' between Clinton and former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   As network executives, reporters, and producers made plans for
broadcasting the Starr report, the issue of sexual content
overshadowed the more basic logistical challenge the networks face
in obtaining, digesting, and airing the massive report before the
competition does. Extra producers, researchers, and reporters have
been mobilized for that task.
</P>
<P>
   Another cause of media nail-biting is the potential for a snafu
when the Starr report is posted on the Internet. Last November, an
electric cable shorted and upended a judge's plan to release on the
Internet a decision to reduce the murder conviction of British au
pair Louise Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is concern, and that is exactly the example that
everybody points to,'' said CBS spokeswoman Sandy Genelius.
</P>
<P>
   But the question of how to handle possibly salacious details in
the Starr report dominated the planning meetings at TV networks
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At CBS, Genelius said the network has decided to air warning
advisories if the network deems it ``absolutely necessary to talk
about some things that people might find distasteful.''
</P>
<P>
   At CNN, spokesman Steve Haworth called it ``a tough balancing
act'' to convey the report's contents without offending viewers.
CNN's decision, Haworth said, is ``try to avoid language that is
graphic and sexual in nature.''
</P>
<P>
   At NBC, spokeswoman Barbara Levin said: ``We will make every
effort to communicate to our viewers the relevant information in
the report while trying to stay within the bounds of good taste.''
</P>
<P>
   At ABC, where extra staffers have been moved from New York
headquarters to the Washington bureau to help on the story,
spokeswoman Eileen Murphy said the network will not ``gratuitously
use any sexually explicit material.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our standard is: What do our viewers need for them to have a
complete understanding of the story?'' said Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   John Moody, vice president of news at Fox News Channel, vowed to
avoid ``wallowing in the mud,'' noting that ``even a medically
correct description of what is alleged to have occurred in the Oval
Office is not something that many viewers want to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, Fox News plans to resort to euphemisms, where
necessary.

   IMPEACH-MARKET (Los Angeles) _ First Asia, then Russia and Latin
America. Now, a possible impeachment of the president of the United

DIVERS TO CONCENTRATE ON BODY RECOVERY FROM FLIGHT 111 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ Battling 9-foot swells and darkening
skies, Canadian divers last evening sank to the ocean floor with
the sole purpose of recovering bodies from the crumpled wreckage of
Swissair 111.
</P>
<P>
   The mission was the first time that divers had been sent to the
bottom with a goal of retrieving bodies rather than mapping debris
or searching for the plane's recorders.
</P>
<P>
   At 5:40 p.m., a single diver dropped from the naval vessel
Granby about 5 miles off Peggy's Cove. The ocean floor there is
littered with large pieces of the airliner's fuselage, as well as
engine parts, landing gear and luggage racks.
</P>
<P>
   An undetermined number of human remains have also been spotted
in the area by remote-control video surveillance. The divers
prepared for their task by watching videos of the debris scene at
the ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   Divers had not searched the area since Monday, and then their
efforts were focused on recovering the MD-11's two ``black boxes.''
The flight-data recorder, one of those boxes, has been retrieved
and is being studied in Ottawa. The cockpit voice recorder remains
in the ocean near the main field of debris.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian Air Force Captain Robert Frank said that, although last
night's goal was to lift human remains, the cockpit recorder
certainly would be recovered if found. Pinging from the recorder's
transponder is being monitored, and military officials believe they
have narrowed its location to within 30 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Vic Gerden, the chief crash investigator, said Thursday that
further study of the flight-data recorder has shown ``anomalies''
in a ``progressive number of parameters.'' Gerden, however, would
not specify what operating systems were affected, only that
problems were detected at various points in various systems during
the final stages of flight.
</P>
<P>
   Gerden, of the Canadian Transportation Safety Board, said that
more work is needed to determine what the digital ``fault codes''
mean.
</P>
<P>
   Safety board officals would not confirm reports that the
flight-data recorder shows that two computers located near the nose
of the airplane received bad data a few minutes after the crew
issued a distress call.
</P>
<P>
   The computers are for air data, which helps guide the autopilot,
and for flight control. The equipment is located near the captain's
seat, on the left side of the airplane, where electronics gear is
stored in a small space called the avionics compartment.
</P>
<P>
   Gerden, however, did confirm that a small portion of a cockpit
seat cover showed some evidence of burning. The Swissair pilots
reported smoke in the cockpit when they first alerted air-traffic
controllers about problems on the New York-to-Geneva flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not zeroing in on anything at this point,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also gave new details about the last minutes of the flight.
He said the last signal from the plane came just after 10:26 p.m.
Atlantic time (9:26 p.m. EDT), when it was flying at 9,700 feet at
a speed of 275 mph.
</P>
<P>
   The plane disappeared from radar screens five minutes later, and
a few seconds after that an impact was recorded on seismic graphs
at a geological center 25 miles away near Halifax, Gerden said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Dr. John Butt, the Nova Scotia medical examiner,
reported that two more bodies have been identified. One of the
victims is an American, but Butt would not release the name. A
total of four bodies have been identified.
</P>
<P>
   US divers are also in Halifax and might begin operations
Saturday. The 33-man team has had experience in the aftermath of
the TWA Flight 800 crash two years ago, the explosion of the space
shuttle Challenger, and the sinking of a crowded Haitian ferry.
</P>
<P>
   One US diver said they expect to find many bodies in poor
condition, but that the task is one for which they have trained
extensively in Little Creek, Va. ``It's an unfortunate job,'' the
diver said.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Bowing out of a confrontation with his emboldened
opposition, President Boris Yeltsin on Thursday named Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov, architect of Russia's hard-line foreign
policy, as his compromise candidate to head a new government.
</P>
<P>
   The nomination of the veteran diplomat and spymaster, a
cool-headed survivor of the Soviet era who has stayed above
Russia's political battles, was instantly welcomed by a wide range
of political leaders, including the Communists, Yeltsin's most
unrelenting foes. A vote on Primakov's nomination is scheduled for
Friday, a sign that his confirmation is all but assured.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov's nomination was seen as a rare, and telling,
concession from Yeltsin. During his seven years in power, Yeltsin
has usually pushed his opponents to the wall, using all of his
political powers _ from artful cajoling to outright force _ to
submit them to his will.
</P>
<P>
   With his own authority now in tatters and the country heading
for an economic depression, Yeltsin and his dwindling team of
advisers chose to sidestep a collision course with the
opposition-dominated lower house. Yeltsin _ who has not been seen
in public since President Clinton left Moscow a week ago _ has not
yet come forward with an explanation of his latest nominee for
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Crucial questions remain about the political make-up and
economic policies of a Primakov government that, after a day of
political hints and haggling, began to look like a coalition
effort. Still, admirers described Primakov as an experienced but
neutral player who will be able to withstand Russia's powerful
political lobbies and heed pragmatic, even politically unpopular,
advice.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics said Primakov, who has no background in economic
management, will be hard pressed to find a formula that will allow
him to both keep his job and steer the country out of its economic
crisis. At best, they said, his will be a caretaker government,
charged with leading the country to early parliamentary and
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov, a Middle East expert who began his career as a
journalist and served briefly as head of Russia's intelligence
service, kept a low profile Thursday, continuing his duties as
foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   The first indication of his policies will come on Friday when he
addresses the parliament in the late afternoon, after a day of
political consultations. He is not expected to name a cabinet
before the vote.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Kremlin said Thursday that a top job in the
new government is likely to go to Yuri Maslyukov, a moderate
Communist who once headed the Soviet state planning agency and
served in Yeltsin's last government. However, liberal economic
reformers may also be in line for positions, including acting
Deputy Prime Minister Boris Fyodorov and Grigory Yavlinsky, head of
the liberal opposition party Yabloko, who was the first to float
Primakov's name on Monday during a stormy debate in parliament.

INTERNET PREPARES FOR HUGE DEMAND FOR STARR REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Includes web site list.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington lawmakers aren't the only people scrambling to
prepare for the release of Kenneth W. Starr's report. Major sites
all over the Internet are girding for what could be their biggest
traffic surge ever, as millions of people around the world try to
download copies of the report.
</P>
<P>
   House members said Thursday that an electronic version of the
report would be published Friday afternoon on three government Web
sites. But with more than 50 million Internet users in the United
States alone, these sites would likely quickly be overwhelmed.
However, a number of major commercial sites, including America
Online, CNN, MSNBC, and the Boston Globe's Web service plan to post
copies of the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working directly with the government to get hold of
that document,'' said Kerrin Roberts, a spokesman for CNN
Interactive.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, CNN is getting ready to handle a torrent of
requests for the report. CNN measures traffic by the number of Web
pages distributed to visitors. The site's highest traffic level was
reached on Sept. 1, the day after a dramatic drop in stock prices.
CNN distributed 22 million Web pages that day, but is planning for
even more Friday.
</P>
<P>
   To handle the load, CNN will go into what it calls ``breaking
news'' mode. It will redesign its Web pages to contain fewer
graphics and other fancy features that take longer to download.
This ``just-the-facts-ma'am'' approach should boost the amount of
traffic the CNN system can handle.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet itself can easily handle the load. The problem is
with the ``server'' computers at each site that transmit the data.
Each server can handle a large but limited number of requests. When
too many people request data, the server slows to a crawl or
crashes altogether.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many Web users will be at home, relying on slow
modems connected to telephone lines. This means they'll have to
stay connected to the server for a longer period, preventing others
from getting access. At 445 pages, the Starr report would probably
take six or seven minutes to download using a common home modem,
compared to a few seconds for a business equipped with a high-speed
digital line.
</P>
<P>
   To cope with this problem, the Boston Globe Web site and a
number of other sites are adding extra server computers to meet the
demand.

 MOSCOW: in parliament.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   `` Primakov will not stop the market transformation in Russia,''
said Yavlinsky on Thursday ``Crony capitalism is one of the main
reasons for the crisis we have today, and Primakov at least is not
linked to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yavlinsky and Fyodorov have said they would try to avoid
policies that would lead to a new infusion of rubles into the
economy and further spur inflation that has already risen
dramatically since the devaluation of the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   After two weeks of political stalemate, Yeltsin on Thursday
accepted an offer by Viktor Chernomyrdin to withdraw his nomination
after it had been defeated twice by the Duma, the lower house of
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is extremely tense, and I do not want to become
a political figure of civil discord, a symbol of confrontation and
animosity,'' said Chernomyrdin, who accused his left-wing opponents
of trying to take power by means of a ``crawling coup.''
</P>
<P>
   Had the Yeltsin nominated Chernomyrdin a third time,
anti-Yeltsin deputies were certain to pursue a vote next week to
impeach the president, throwing the country into a full-blown
constitutional crisis. Under the Russian Constitution, a vote to
impeach the president would have blocked him from disbanding the
parliament. But disbanding the parliament is mandatory under the
constitution upon a third rejection of his candidate for prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   In the parliament building Thursday, Yeltsin's compromise choice
was greeted with a sigh of relief by deputies, many of whom feared
that the political crisis could quickly spin out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Yavlinsky, whose Yabloko party opposed Chernomyrdin from the
start, on Thursday called the nomination of Primakov a ``step
towards stability'' and described him as a compromise figure who
can lead the country to new elections.
</P>
<P>
   Gennady Zyuganov, head of the Communist Party, also welcomed
Primakov's candidacy. ``Everyone understands that we need a
consolidating figure,'' he told reporters. ``This will be good for
Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside parliament, Primakov's nomination was cheered by figures
as diverse as the former Soviet president, Mikhail Gorbachev, and
Alexander Lebed, the ex-general and regional governor who is seen
as a leading contender for Yeltsin's job.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev, whom Primakov served as both a foreign policy adviser
and as chairman of the upper chamber of the Soviet-era parliament,
said he will ``work to get rid of radical liberal extremes and
avoid a return to the past.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone steps in his way,'' said Gorbachev, ``that person
will have to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The lone dissenting voice in the chorus of support for Primakov
belonged to Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the maverick ultranationalist,
who said Yeltsin had chosen his nominee at the request of Clinton.
A Primakov government will be a ``death squad'' because it won't
last more than two months, said Zhirinovsky.
</P>
<P>
   In his two years as Yeltsin's foreign minister, Primakov has
clashed with Washington on several key foreign policy issues,
including Iraq and Yugoslavia. But he has also pressed ahead for
the ratification of the START II arms control treaty, and although
he is a staunch opponent of NATO expansion, he helped draft a
document giving Moscow a diplomatic reason to accept the shifting
strategic balance in Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Several average Russians, struggling to figure out how to pay
for groceries that have soared in price, said in interviews
Thursday night that they weren't sure Primakov will be able to
solve their problems any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won't be able to manage the situation because he is not an
economist,'' said Anna Sichova, a 20-year-old graduate student.
</P>
<P>
   But Nikolai Maltsev, a 70-year-old social science professor, saw
him as the the best of the available compromise choices. ``He is a
straight-forward person, and he is very realistic,'' Maltsev said.
</P>
<P>
   When Yeltsin named Chernomyrdin on Aug. 23 to take back his old
job as prime minister, many analysts saw the move as an attempt to
reassure the public _ and the parliament _ with the return of a
familiar figure, a stolid baron of Soviet industry who had strong
ties to the country's financial and industrial elite. Instead, that
strategy backfired as the opposition and the public turned on
Chernomyrdin as the man responsible for the corruption and
mismanagement that have accompanied the last seven years of
Western-style economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The parliament, sensing Yeltsin's weakness, tried to press the
president to cede some of his constitutional powers and give
legislators more of a say in forming new governments. An agreement
to redistribute those powers eventually collapsed, leaving the
parliament with no formal right to intervene in Primakov's
selection of his ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of changing the rules, the parliamentary opposition set
its sights on forcing Yeltsin to change his candidate. A list of
several alternatives was presented to the president during a
round-table meeting earlier this week, but Yeltsin at that time
stuck by Chernomyrdin, who suffered a second defeat on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   If Yavlinsky gets a foothold in a Primakov government, it will
be a vindication of his party's steadfast opposition to
Chernomyrdin, which had made it a tactical, if uncomfortable, ally
of the Communists. Yavlinsky on Thursday presented Primakov as a
figure who commands considerable authority but has no political
ties to parties or lobbies, who is known around the world but has
no intention of becoming president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not our first choice, but he is the best choice among
the alternatives,'' Yavlinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday, Yavlinsky said the idea of putting
forward Primakov's name had first come up during the debate over
the nomination of Sergei Kiriyenko, the 36-year-old banker who
served as prime minister from April until he was dismissed in
August. Yavlinsky's party had also opposed Kiriyenko's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started thinking about who could provide stability,'' said
Yavlinsky, who said he subsequently mentioned the idea privately to
Primakov. According to Yavlinsky, Primakov dismissed the notion out
of hand. ``He said there was no such possibility,'' Yavlinsky
said. &QL;

DIVERS TO CONCENTRATE ON BODY RECOVERY FROM FLIGHT 111

   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ Battling 9-foot swells and darkening
skies, Canadian divers last evening sank to the ocean floor with
the sole purpose of recovering bodies from the crumpled wreckage of
Swissair 111.
</P>
<P>
   The mission was the first time that divers had been sent to the
bottom with a goal of retrieving bodies rather than mapping debris
or searching for the plane's recorders.
</P>
<P>
   At 5:40 p.m., a single diver dropped from the naval vessel
Granby about 5 miles off Peggy's Cove. The ocean floor there is
littered with large pieces of the airliner's fuselage, as well as
engine parts, landing gear and luggage racks.
</P>
<P>
   An undetermined number of human remains have also been spotted
in the area by remote-control video surveillance. The divers
prepared for their task by watching videos of the debris scene at
the ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   Divers had not searched the area since Monday, and then their
efforts were focused on recovering the MD-11's two ``black boxes.''
The flight-data recorder, one of those boxes, has been retrieved
and is being studied in Ottawa. The cockpit voice recorder remains
in the ocean near the main field of debris.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian Air Force Captain Robert Frank said that, although last
night's goal was to lift human remains, the cockpit recorder
certainly would be recovered if found. Pinging from the recorder's
transponder is being monitored, and military officials believe they
have narrowed its location to within 30 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Vic Gerden, the chief crash investigator, said Thursday that
further study of the flight-data recorder has shown ``anomalies''
in a ``progressive number of parameters.'' Gerden, however, would
not specify what operating systems were affected, only that
problems were detected at various points in various systems during
the final stages of flight.
</P>
<P>
   Gerden, of the Canadian Transportation Safety Board, said that
more work is needed to determine what the digital ``fault codes''
mean.
</P>
<P>
   Safety board officals would not confirm reports that the
flight-data recorder shows that two computers located near the nose
of the airplane received bad data a few minutes after the crew
issued a distress call.
</P>
<P>
   The computers are for air data, which helps guide the autopilot,
and for flight control. The equipment is located near the captain's
seat, on the left side of the airplane, where electronics gear is
stored in a small space called the avionics compartment.
</P>
<P>
   Gerden, however, did confirm that a small portion of a cockpit
seat cover showed some evidence of burning. The Swissair pilots
reported smoke in the cockpit when they first alerted air-traffic
controllers about problems on the New York-to-Geneva flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not zeroing in on anything at this point,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also gave new details about the last minutes of the flight.
He said the last signal from the plane came just after 10:26 p.m.
Atlantic time (9:26 p.m. EDT), when it was flying at 9,700 feet at
a speed of 275 mph.
</P>
<P>
   The plane disappeared from radar screens five minutes later, and
a few seconds after that an impact was recorded on seismic graphs
at a geological center 25 miles away near Halifax, Gerden said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Dr. John Butt, the Nova Scotia medical examiner,
reported that two more bodies have been identified. One of the
victims is an American, but Butt would not release the name. A
total of four bodies have been identified.
</P>
<P>
   US divers are also in Halifax and might begin operations
Saturday. The 33-man team has had experience in the aftermath of
the TWA Flight 800 crash two years ago, the explosion of the space
shuttle Challenger, and the sinking of a crowded Haitian ferry.
</P>
<P>
   One US diver said they expect to find many bodies in poor
condition, but that the task is one for which they have trained
extensively in Little Creek, Va. ``It's an unfortunate job,'' the
diver said.

COMMENTARY: BRINGING OUT THE BEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDITORS: Thomas Friedman is on leave to write a book. He has taken
time out to write a column on what McGwire's record-shattering
summer has meant to America.) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   You didn't have to be a baseball fanatic to get swept up in the
emotion of watching Mark McGwire's 62d home run clear the
left-field wall at Busch Stadium the other night, or seeing him
skip around the bases and hug his son at home plate. But surely the
emotion that so many Americans felt at this moment was not just
about a great record broken, by a nice guy. No, the whole way in
which McGwire and Sammy Sosa have handled themselves, and the whole
way in which baseball fans have responded _ giving the baseballs
back for free _ is such a reminder of how much we need role models,
how sorely they are missing now, and how much good they can
actually do when they appear.
</P>
<P>
   What was so striking about McGwire was how a man with a rocky
past grew to understand that breaking this record made him a role
model, like it or not, and therefore imposed upon him a special
obligation to both his historic predecessors _ namely Babe Ruth and
Roger Maris _ but also to the fans. And because he brought out the
best in himself, in both words and deeds _ honoring the Maris
family, signing endless autographs and giving endless interviews _
he has brought out the best in the fans as well.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has had one day off in the past two weeks, on which,
according to The Washington Post, he spent 10 hours filming a
public service announcement, paid for by himself, on child abuse.
Unselfishness begets unselfishness. The fan who caught the 61st
ball, Mike Davidson, who works a 60-hour week, turned it over to
McGwire, saying, ``It would mean more to him and baseball than it
would to me.'' The only thing he wanted was an autographed shirt
from McGwire and a chance to shake his hand. Forget the $1 million.
Groundskeeper Tim Forneris returned the 62d home run ball with the
same spirit: ``It's not mine to begin with. McGwire just lost it,
and I brought it home. I'm just a regular Joe.''
</P>
<P>
   Think of how McGwire could have handled himself. He could have
said that a ``legally accurate'' interpretation of his contract
would indicate that he does not have to sign endless autographs for
free. He could have said that even baseball superstars have private
lives, and therefore he does not have to answer any questions about
muscle-building supplements, his divorce or his son, and has no
obligation to uphold the historic office of America's home run
king. In due time, no doubt, he will reap some very lucrative
endorsement contracts. But for now he has virtually none, even
though he could be out there hustling every long-distance phone
company, or signing a quickie book deal for, say, $4.5 million from
Rupert Murdoch, while telling us that professional athletes have
short careers so they have to cash in while on the job. Tim
Forneris could have said that since there is ``no controlling legal
authority'' governing home run balls hit into the bleachers, he was
entitled to sell McGwire's 62d home run ball to the highest bidder.
</P>
<P>
   No, in their own way, this poor Dominican street kid named Sammy
and the well-to-do dentist's son from Southern California named Mac
are giving the country the civics lesson it needs most _ reminding
us that a democratic society is not just about the letter of laws,
but about the spirit of laws. It is not just about rules, but about
norms. It is not just about legalistic job descriptions, but about
role models. It is not just about the entitlements of ``me'' and
``now,'' but about the obligations to those who came before and
those who will come after.
</P>
<P>
   It is only for a brief shining moment, but the McGwire-Sosa home
run race is just the right antidote for Washington today. It isn't
Wag the Dog, it isn't Wag the Dow, it isn't Monica Lewinsky, it
isn't Ken Starr and it isn't Bill Clinton _ all bringing out the
worst in us. It's just two nice guys bringing out the best in each
other in a way that brings out the best in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The other night St. Louis fans kept giving Sammy Sosa standing
ovations. That is truly unusual. The Cubs-Cardinals rivalry goes
back years. It is one of THE rivalries in baseball. They NEVER give
each other standing ovations. But seeing Sosa run in from right
field and leap into a bear hug from McGwire after his 62d, the fans
just responded in kind. What Mac and Sosa convey is that their
passion and respect for the game, and each other, is even greater
than their passion for which team wins.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't it be nice if Democratic and Republican leaders treated
the country with the same respect?

COMMENTARY: A TEST FOR THE PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By A.M. ROSENTHAL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At about 5:30 Wednesday evening, Saddam Hussein became the man
who will first test Bill Clinton's remaining ability to preside
over the United States government and protect American national
interests.
</P>
<P>
   The world is barely aware of what happened. But soon it will
understand that at U.N. headquarters, the Security Council created
a choice, indirectly but inescapably: peace, if Saddam Hussein
complies with U.N. orders to permit full inspection to find his
hidden weapons; the strong likelihood of attack by the United
States, if he refuses, or the continued appeasement of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Washington and the United Nations, under President Bush as well
as President Clinton, have usually chosen appeasement after Iraq
was defeated in the Persian Gulf war. But something new has been
happening.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's determination, and successes, in pushing toward Saddam's
goal of producing nuclear, chemical and biological weaponry are
generally acknowledged at the United Nations even by his friends
and lackeys. Even they know that he fears the one barrier that
stands in his way to becoming the great Mideast superpower _
unfettered U.N. inspection.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. inspectors already have uncovered the makings and plans for
Iraq's weapons of hell _ including traces of the deadly poison gas
VX. Scott Ritter, the U.N. inspector who resigned to try to alert
America, told U.S. senators that Iraq was about three years from
making nuclear weapons, and six months from biological weapons;
three years, six months.
</P>
<P>
   So on Aug. 5, Saddam once again banned inspection. That was a
few months after Secretary-General Kofi Annan got the Iraqi's
signed personal promise not to do it again. So Sept. 9, by a
unanimous vote of its 15 members, the Council got around to
ordering Saddam to unban.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Council added a penalty: until he permits full
inspection the United Nations will cease the regular reviews of
sanctions against Iraq. Saddam had counted on the reviews to end
sanctions quickly. But from the beginning of his defiance of the
United Nations immediately after his military defeat in 1991, it
was sickeningly obvious he cared a lot more about how many weapons
of mass destruction he was making than how many Iraqis were hurting
from sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright deserves the credit for
working out a resolution strong enough to carry a warning to
Saddam, but that could get the vote of Iraq's usual supporters and
apologists, at least for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   For Saddam to accept full inspection is to end his dream of
controlling the entire Mideast with weapons of mass destruction. So
he will continue to fight inspection, and stall on calling off the
latest in his series of inspection bans.
</P>
<P>
   The what-next responsibility can only be the president's, if he
does his duty _ despite his scandal and shame, despite the ever
smaller number of people around him who believe in him. The duty he
did not perform before is now his hope for redemption in history.
</P>
<P>
   He is the president. He will have to act on the choice before
him. He can tacitly, and denying it all the time, accept Iraq as
the military superpower of the Middle East, the germ warfare
supplier to terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Or he can order air attacks on all military and government
installations _ and hope that by missile or revolution, Saddam will
be killed.
</P>
<P>
   France won't like it, neither will China. And the new Yeltsin
choice for prime minister turns out to be Agent Primakov himself.
He is the former high KGB operative _ if there are any ``formers''
among such _ who is Saddam's great supporter abroad.
</P>
<P>
   So, if he is to be taken seriously, Clinton will have to tell
the United Nations that under the U.N. Charter and existing
resolutions, the United States has the power to do it alone and, if
necessary, will.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents Bush and Clinton could have done that before. But the
courage and skills of U.N. inspectors, the growth of the danger
from Iraqi weapons, from Saddam or his traveling terrorists,
eliminate any wiggle-out room for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   And it is possible that on this matter of war, peace or
appeasement, Bill Clinton will no longer want a hiding place, or
seek one.
</P>
<P>
   Security Council meetings are now held in private, so diplomats
can act and hide at the same time. Bill Clinton should insist on an
open meeting for him, so the world can hear him, as America's
president.

<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia Hundreds of students, ringed by soldiers,
staged a noisy but peaceful demonstration Thursday across from the
presidential palace in the third day of protests aimed at President
B.J. Habibie and his Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Habibie must step down and be replaced by a transitional
government,'' said Indra Tarindrianto, an organizer for the
Communication Forum of the Jakarta Student Senate, a umbrella group
of students from 24 universities. Students have vowed to press
their cause before a special parliamentary session planned for
November to pass new electoral laws.
</P>
<P>
   With summer vacation coming to an end, the students who played a
key role in bringing down President Suharto last May after his 32
years in power are making their way back onto campuses and hoping
to again change the course of history.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Habibie is not serious and consistent in dealing with
allegations of human rights violations and the skyrocketing prices
of essential goods, the students will come back and could be even
bigger,'' said Muridan Widjoyo, from the Indonesian Institute of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   A major focus of the unrest is inflation, which has climbed past
70 percent a year. &QL;

MAN WHO ALLEGES PRIEST ABUSE SUES BOSTON ARCHDIOCESE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Ohio, Md.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLEMENT   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A Charlestown man who charges he was repeatedly
molested by a priest as a child has sued The Archdiocese of Boston
because it allegedly allowed the priest to train him and other
altar boys _ even though they knew he had a history of child sexual
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Lacey, 21, filed the suit with his mother, Annemarie
Vesey, in Suffolk Superior Court. The suit alleges that the priest,
Robert M. Burns, molested Lacey inside St. Mary's and its rectory
between 1986 and 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Burns' abuse, the suit contends, caused Lacey to fall victim to
substance abuse, anguish and bodily pain. Burns, who is no longer a
priest, is now in New Hampshire state prison on an unspecified
charge, according to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   John Walsh, spokesman for the Boston Archdiocese, said Thursday
he could not talk about Burns' assignments in Boston because of the
lawsuit _ one of more than a dozen similar suits the archdiocese
has faced since the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Lacey nor his mother could be reached for comment. Their
lawyer, Timothy P. O'Connell, did not return phone messages to his
home.
</P>
<P>
   According to the lawsuit, Burns was a parish priest in
Youngstown, Ohio in 1981 when the church first discovered he was
molesting children. He was sent to the House of Affirmation in
Worcester for treatment and counseling.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned, according to the lawsuit, he continued
molesting children. At some point between 1982 and 1985, the suit
alleges, Youngstown Bishop James W. Malone and the late Humberto
Cardinal Medeiros reassigned Burns to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Malone purportedly warned Medeiros that Burns could still harm
children, according to the lawsuit. Malone also urged Boston
officials to keep Burns away from young boys and to disclose Burns'
past.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit states that Burns continued to molest children at
St. Thomas Aquinas Church in Jamaica Plain, his first assignment.
In 1986, he was transferred to St. Mary's parish in Charlestown,
the suit alleges, where Lacey, then 10 years old, had just begun
training as an altar boy.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next five years, according to the lawsuit, Burns
repeatedly forced Lacey to perform ``non-consensual sexual acts''
while Lacy ``was under his pastoral care and guidance.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Mary's current pastor, Rev. James B. Canniff, gave Burns the
assignment, according to the lawsuit. Canniff _ who is also a
co-defendant in the lawsuit along with the archdiocese, Burns,
Cardinal Bernard Law, Malone and the Youngstown diocese _ did not
return a telephone call Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The assaults stopped Nov. 16, 1991 when Burns apparently again
caught the attention of the church, according to the lawsuit. He
was sent to St. Luke's Institute in Maryland &UR;  &LR; for treatment as a
pedophile; the institute urged that Burns undergo extensive tests
due to the ``depth of his impairment,'' but Burns rejected the
recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   According to the lawsuit, Burns was not allowed to return to St.
Mary's, and the archdiocese did not disclose his history of abusing
children until March 1996 to shield itself from a lawsuit. Lacey,
the suit states, didn't realize Burns was responsible for his
emotional upheaval in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the archdiocese paid millions of dollars to settle
lawsuits brought by people who said they had been molested by Rev.
John Geoghan, a now-retired priest.
</P>
<P>
   For the past several years, Walsh said, the archdiocese has
tried to work with victims of pedophile priests by offering
spiritual and emotional counseling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also advise people who come to us of their rights to be
represented by counsel, to pursue criminal charges, if that's
appropriate,'' Walsh said. ``If things come up from the past, we
have to deal with them in whatever is the appropriate way.''

<P>
   SEATTLE _ After criticizing President Clinton for the ``sordid
spectacle'' of an extramarital affair and airing a campaign
advertisement in which she says that ``personal conduct and
integrity does matter,'' Rep. Helen Chenoweth, R-Idaho, admitted
Thursday that she herself had once engaged in a long-term affair
with a married man.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most conservative members of Congress, the two-term
Republican has been bitingly critical of Clinton for his personal
behavior. And she has used his admitted relationship with a White
House intern as the basis for a television commercial taunting her
Democratic opponent, Dan Williams, in which, speaking against a
backdrop of American and Idaho flags, she speaks out against the
president and asks, ``Where do you stand, Dan?''
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday, responding to an inquiry by The Idaho Statesman
that seems to have been set off by the anger of her former lover's
wife over the tone and content of the campaign commercial, Ms.
Chenoweth conceded that she had carried on a six-year affair with a
married man who was once her business partner.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chenoweth, 60, repeatedly sought Thursday to draw a
distinction between her behavior and that of Clinton, noting that
her affair occurred after her divorce and while she was not a
public official.
</P>
<P>
   ``My private life was my own life,'' said the congresswoman.
``Fourteen years ago, when I was a private citizen and a single
woman, I was involved in a relationship that I came to regret, that
I'm not proud of. I've asked for God's forgiveness, and I've
received it.''
</P>
<P>
   At another point in the article, Ms. Chenoweth argued that what
really mattered was her conduct while holding a public office.
``It's a matter of trust,'' she said. ``I can say anyone who can
follow me around since I declared for office can't help but be
utterly bored with my social life. I believe that once you enter
into this tour of duty, it has to be 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chenoweth's admission throws a bizarre wrench into her
campaign, which leaned heavily on appeals to family values, and may
dampen her attempts to lash her opponent to Clinton's problems. It
also comes just days after another prominent Republican in
Congress, Rep. Dan Burton of Indiana, confessed to fathering a
child in an extramarital relationship in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But while Burton has also been a biting critic of the president,
his attacks have been more directed at the president's fund-raising
activities than at his sexual life. Ms. Chenoweth, who was elected
four years ago partly by capitalizing on the admitted extramarital
affair of her opponent at the time, has consistently criticized
Clinton for his morals and sexual behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans feel we really deserve so much better from our
president than to lower himself to this sort of sordid spectacle,''
Ms. Chenoweth said the day after Clinton admitted to having had a
relationship with a White House intern. Her television
advertisements have emphasized this theme. In one she intones:
``Our founding fathers knew that political leaders' personal
conduct must be held to the highest standards.''
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Chenoweth's confession, which was major news in her
district Thursday, would seem to be a political gift for Williams,
a Boise lawyer, he did not seem inclined Thursday to seize upon the
issue, and he passed up an opportunity to comment on whether she
was being hypocritical in her attacks on Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is the people out here care a lot more about real
issues that affect their families' lives than they do about
anyone's personal life, whether it's Helen Chenoweth's or Bill
Clinton's,'' Williams said in a telephone interview Thursday
afternoon. ``The focus of my campaign has been on those issues _
public schools, Social Security, HMO reform _ and that's not going
to change.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In selecting Yevgeny Primakov as prime minister,
President Boris Yeltsin has picked a wily diplomat and steely
opponent of U.S. dominance.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that the choice of the foreign policy
strategist and former intelligence chief is a popular one for the
Communist opposition and for Russians who miss the stability of
Soviet times.
</P>
<P>
   What Primakov has not done, however, is grapple with the task of
advancing market reforms in a nation shaped by seven decades of
Communist rule.
</P>
<P>
   His few pronouncements on economics have been vague musings
about the need to use the power of the state to boost ailing
industries and complaints about the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, his success will depend heavily on the aides
who are entrusted with economic policy. And as Russia's new
government begins to take shape, it is looking more like a
disparate coalition of Communists, social democrats and market
reformers than a coherent team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Primakov is not a Communist,'' said Mikhail Berger, an
economic specialist and editor of the newspaper Segodnya. ``He is
not red. But he is a bit pink.''
</P>
<P>
   Yevgeny Primakov, 68, grew up in the Soviet Union's lost empire.
He was born in Kiev, Ukraine, and raised in Tbilisi, Georgia. Of
Jewish heritage, he adopted the family name of his stepfather in a
concession to the anti-Semitism of Soviet times.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov graduated from the Institute of Oriental Studies in
Moscow and became a Pravda correspondent in the Middle East, a
profession often linked to intelligence gathering.
</P>
<P>
   When Mikhail Gorbachev led the Soviet Union, Primakov was on the
liberal end of the Soviet orthodoxy, but hardly a bold reformer. He
ran the Institute of World Economy and International Relations, a
leading Soviet think tank, before becoming a Politburo member and
Gorbachev aide.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov stepped onto the world stage when he sought to block
U.S. military action against the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. In
a feverish round of shuttle diplomacy, Primakov sought to negotiate
a compromise to give Saddam Hussein a face-saving way out.
</P>
<P>
   That did not endear Primakov to the Americans, but it did him no
harm at home. Gorbachev later made Primakov head of the Foreign
Intelligence Service, one of the successors to the old KGB. He was
the highest-ranking official to keep his job despite the collapse
of the Soviet state, a sign of his bureaucratic survival skills.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov used his intelligence post to weigh in on foreign
policy, issuing reports that assailed Washington for trying to take
advantage of a weakened Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Those are increasingly popular views in Russia. And when Yeltsin
ran for a new term in 1996, he sought to appeal to nationalist
sentiment by making Primakov his foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``Primakov represents today's paradigm,'' said Alexander Oslon,
one of Russia's most highly regarded pollsters. ``He is a
conservative. He is wiley and without youthful zeal. That
corresponds to the popular mood that Russia is not strong, that no
one wants to help us and that we need to be wiley.''
</P>
<P>
   With the economy in ruins, Russia's diplomats have had limited
room for maneuver. A pragmatist, Primakov has developed a working
relationship with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   But he also challenged U.S. dominance in a way that stops just
short of confrontation. Primakov has fought relentlessly against
NATO expansion. He has frustrated tough action to quell the
fighting in Kosovo. He has backed the sale of Russian anti-aircraft
missiles to the Greek Cypriot government, a move Washington worries
could trigger a war between Greece and Turkey, two NATO members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Primakov wants to fix Russia's position as a great power,''
said Igor Golemiovsky, the editor of the newspaper Novaya Izvestia.
``His position is that everyone should have to take account of the
new Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   With Russians lining up to retrieve their savings from insolvent
banks and the value of the ruble changing by the hour, the new
Russia does not look much like a great power.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Kiriyenko, the youthful prime minister who was ousted
last month, was touted as a technocrat who put politics aside to
focus on economics.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov is the reverse. He was praised Thursday as a savvy
leader who would nurture political ties with the Communists and
pro-market forces while leaving the nitty-gritty of economic policy
to others.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear, however, how he would rescue Russia. His
economic philosophy, to the extent he has defined it, is a vague
melding of capitalist and socialist themes.
</P>
<P>
   In a June speech, Primakov said there was no danger that Russia
would return to its Communist past. But he went on to criticize the
International Monetary Fund while endorsing the use of credits to
help Russia's stricken industry as part of some sort of Russian
version of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's ``New Deal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not pay enough attention to economic growth because we
were focused on macroeconomic financial stability at the request of
the IMF,'' he said. ``We can learn from the United States. During
the process of recovery from the Great Depression, Roosevelt took
some state measures, tax measures that benefited the development of
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Those slogans have soothed the left-wing opposition. But just
what they would mean in practice and who would define them is
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Grigory Yavlinsky, the leader of the liberal Yabloko party who
called for Primakov's selection, is a leading candidate for a high
economic post.
</P>
<P>
   Yavlinsky's party resembles the social democratic parties of
Western Europe and he has been has been skeptical of the tough
``currency board'' plan the Kremlin promoted just last week to
establish a fixed rate for the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   But he is just one of the politicians who are likely to find a
place on in the Primakov coalition. Yuri Maslyukov, a Communist
member of parliament and the former head of the Soviet economic
planning agency, is likely to become a first deputy prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Viktor Geraschenko, the head of the Central Bank from 1992 to
1994 whose loose money policies help plunge the ruble, may even be
restored to that post, Yeltsin's spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   That appointment would not sit well with Boris Fyodorov, the
pro-capitalist Kremlin aide who has his own ties to Primakov. He
worked for him during Soviet times when Primakov headed the world
economic institute.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Yavlinsky, Fyodorov is a ardent champion of the currency
board approach. And his views of Geraschenko is clear. Fyodorov
once wrote a dictionary of economic terms in which he described
Geraschenko as the ``worst central banker in the world.'' &QL;

ENCORES! SERIES DIRECTOR LEAVES WELL ENOUGH ALONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Not long ago, Glenn Casale made a Manhattan
theater excursion to catch up on a few Broadway shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lion King''? He ``marveled'' at the technology and
director Julie Taymor's boundless creativity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Titanic''?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see the value in it,'' Casale says earnestly.
</P>
<P>
   OK, Glenn, how about ``Jekyll &AMP; Hyde,'' which a number of
critics found hollow and overbearing?
</P>
<P>
   ``I see why `Jekyll &AMP; Hyde' excites people, like a rock concert
does,'' Casale replies approvingly. ``The music and the voices
bleed together and overwhelm people.''
</P>
<P>
   By now you're probably getting the picture that Casale is a man
both of broad tastes and finely honed diplomatic skills. Or perhaps
it's just that, as the Toluca Lake resident puts it, ``I'm an easy
audience because I see the work that goes behind it.''
</P>
<P>
   Southern California audiences are getting used to seeing the
work behind Casale's own productions. An upstate New York native,
Casale has become one of the West Coast's most prolific and
well-regarded theater directors since migrating here in the early
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   For the next two weeks, he'll be helming ``The Threepenny
Opera,'' the latest offering in the Encores! series of staged
concert musicals, which opened Wednesday at UCLA's Freud Playhouse.
In between, he's been laying the groundwork for the Broadway
opening of ``Peter Pan,'' in a musically new production starring
Cathy Rigby, which recently played L.A.'s Pantages Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   A winner of several Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle awards for
directing, Casale's musical theater credits include ``Into the
Woods'' with Leslie Uggams, ``Fiddler on the Roof'' with Theodore
Bikel and ``Sweet Charity'' with Donna McKechnie. For ``Peter
Pan,'' he and Rigby opted for a slightly scarier version than usual
of the children's musical, sticking closely to the spirit of J.M.
Barrie's original book.
</P>
<P>
   While Casale explains that ``I tend to like darker shows,'' with
``Threepenny Opera'' he's making a point of keeping things light.
After all, the Kurt Weill-Bertolt Brecht ``musical'' satire about a
gang of cutthroats and beggars hardly needs sobering up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night, I was driving home from rehearsal and I thought,
`I've got to maintain the humor','' he says. ``Brecht's humor is so
important. You're so bound by the political nature of the piece
that you've got to have other things that diffuse the politics.
You've got to maintain the humor, you've got to maintain the
sexuality. Because this piece is all about urges.''
</P>
<P>
   Casale says he got the urge to do ``Threepenny'' after
discussing a list of possible shows with Marcia Seligson, producing
artistic director of Encores! Inspired by the highly successful
Encores! series at New York's City Center, Reprise! made its debut
in the spring of 1997 with ``Promises, Promises'' and also has
included ``Finian's Rainbow,'' ``Wonderful Town'' and ``The Pajama
Game.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, ``Threepenny'' is a surprising choice for the series,
which aims at restoring luster to the scores of musicals that are
seldom revived, usually because they have books that are
problematic and/or have aged badly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Threepenny,'' by contrast, is revived fairly often at regional
theaters, colleges and so on, though its last Broadway outing was a
critically lambasted 1989 production starring rock singer Sting. A
far more successful Joseph Papp production, starring Raul Julia as
Mack the Knife, ran for months on Broadway in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Casale says ``Threepenny'' will remind audiences that great
musicals needn't always be sweetness-and-light, boy-meets-girl
affairs _ as the recent ``Chicago'' revival, developed through the
Encores! series, aptly demonstrated.
</P>
<P>
   He also believes the show offers a textbook opportunity for
strong ensemble acting. To that end, he's assembled an impeccably
credentialed cast _ Bikel, Ken Page, Rachel York, Carrie Hamilton,
Jonelle Allen, among others _ without any major TV or film stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked for actors who were aggressive in their acting
choices,'' Casale says. ``I really believe in the actors'
creativity, when you allow them to be creative without judgment. I
believe that in whatever I do, even if I'm doing `Fiddler,' if you
don't have an ensemble, I don't care who your stars are, you don't
have a play.''
</P>
<P>
   Known both as a thorough and a pleasant taskmaster, Casale has
all his actors write biographies of their characters, no matter how
large or small their parts. Beggars, for instance, had to decide
how long they'd been with the Peachums and how they'd lost their
various arms and legs.
</P>
<P>
   Casale even asked one woman to consider whether her character's
amputated leg was real or a put-on. After a dinner break, she
decided her character was faking it. So now, after hobbling around
in Act 1, she mysteriously sheds her injury in Act 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that will be a fun moment,'' Casale says.

   WASHINGTON _ Internet users can expect long delays at government
and private Internet sites that post Independent Counsel Ken
Starr's report Friday, but experts said they do not expect a Web
``meltdown.''
</P>
<P>
   The Thomas site at the Library of Congress
(http://thomas.loc.gov/icreport) is one of at least three
government sites designated to receive the report after it is
released by the House on Friday. The others are a page on the House
of Representatives Web site (http://www.house.gov/icreport) and one
at the Government Printing Office
(http://www.access.gpo.gov/congress/congress/icreport).
</P>
<P>
   The posting will be historic because such an important document
has never before been released to the public on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been one of the innovations of this majority that we
made in 1995 that we make as much of the proceedings of the House
availble to the public as quickly as possible,'' said House
Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be millions of Americans familiarizing themselves
with computers this weekend,'' said Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Web measurement firm Relevant Knowledge says the
report is expected to boost traffic to most major online news
sites, along with Thomas and the House site.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've seen historically, specifically when Princess Diana
died, the British monarchy's Web site got a lot of traffic which we
never saw them get until that happened,'' said spokeswoman Michelle
Beilsmith. ``August was a tremendous news month, with the Clinton
televised apology and the bombings.''
</P>
<P>
   But she pointed out that while overall traffic was up, the
average duration of individual visits and average pages views
dropped. ``People were going to find specific news, getting that
news and leaving the sites,'' she says. ``More people were logging
on, but they weren't staying as long as an average user on an
average day.''
</P>
<P>
   People seeking the report ``will slow things down,'' said Doug
McFarland, senior vice president and general manager of Media
Metrix(cq), a New York-based online monitoring firm. But because of
technical tricks that will ease the pressure on the government
sites, ``I don't think that it's going to smash them.''
</P>
<P>
   In a matter of hours after House Speaker Newt Gingrich said
Thursday that Thomas would be the likely place for Congress to post
the report or sections of the 445-page report, Thomas was already
buckling under the weight of increased traffic from mainstream Web
surfers and news junkies.
</P>
<P>
   The Library of Congress site that contains Thomas consists of 14
linked IBM servers. It averages 1 million hits a day, said Guy
Lamolinara, a spokesman for the Library, but was getting 40 hits a
second late this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The library was not sure how quickly it would be able to post
the Starr report on Friday, Lamolinara said. Webmasters were even
unsure Thursday afternoon whether they would receive the
information in electronic form or on paper , he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a normal situation,'' Lamolinara said. ``We're not
certain what form it's coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday afternoon, Thomas had replaced its home page with
a simple white easy-to-load page explaining that the report is not
yet on the site and probably won't be until late Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's early warning alert gives Thomas a bit of breathing
room to accommodate how it will handle volumes of traffic typically
seen by brand-name consumer news sites. But it's clear they're
going to need some help from the major news organizations and Web
sites that are built to handle this kind of traffic and can post
some or all of the document to ease some of the traffic to the
Thomas site.
</P>
<P>
   The big news sites such as CNN, which are used to nearly
record-breaking traffic on big news days, are already retooling,
refining and getting their Web sites ready to handle the traffic
from the United States and around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're already working with people in the government to get the
document on line'' said CNN.com spokesman Kerrin Roberts, who also
predicted record traffic. ``We are expecting high volume, and our
repeat users will continually be returning to the site to check it.
So we are braced for the breaking news whenever it happens, with
our stripped-down home page for easy user access.''
</P>
<P>
   ABCNews.com spokeswoman Michelle Bergman said the ``plan of the
moment at ABCNews is to post only pieces of the report. ``As we
understand it, the full report will be on the federal Web site and
we will provide a link to that site. We have to be flexible,''
Bergman said, ``but our plan right now is to post selections that
will give our users the full feel of the document and post relevant
links as part of our coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Wired News (http://www.wirednews,com) and MSNBC.com will also
publish the report as soon as it becomes publicly available.
</P>
<P>
   One technical trick that large sites will use to speed users'
access is ``caching'' the report.
</P>
<P>
   America Online spokeswoman Pam McGraw said that if the
government posts the report, ''We will point to the Web site and
cache the report, essentially take a copy of it so it can reside on
our servers so we can make it available to our members.
</P>
<P>
   ''The caching will help take the load off the government Web
site. We don't know how many servers they have whereas we have
football fields of servers that carry our content. We also have a
chat event that takes place at 4 p.m. , The site will be linked off
the main screen so members can find it right away.''
</P>
<P>
   While some Democratic members of Congress questioned the rapid
release of the report on grounds of fairness to President Clinton,
one Republican raised a different ethics concern.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., said he questioned Judiciary Committee
Chairman Henry Hyde about whether putting the Starr report on the
Internet would violate the spirit of a bill that recently passed
the House banning pornography on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde indicated that was a concern since some aspects of the
Starr report ``could be of such a graphic nature,'' as to violate
the intent of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Although official government documents would not be subject to
laws against pornography, Foley said there would be an appearance
of a conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers also were concerned that people not connected with the
scandal may be mentioned in some of the grand jury testimony or
other documents, Foley said, indicating that Gingrich was siding
with those who wanted to delete such names.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are still some things that need to be resolved''
before the report is made public, he said.

ZEDILLO TOURS FLOOD-RAVAGED ZONES 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Confronted with Mexico's worst flooding in a half
century, President Ernesto Zedillo toured hard-hit Chiapas state
and pledged more than 1,000 troops to help with the relief effort.
</P>
<P>
   A week of torrential rains across Mexico has killed more than
three dozen people, stretched rescue and disaster crews to their
limit and, despite Zedillo's high-profile visit, has left
government officials open to criticism once again for their
inadequate response.
</P>
<P>
   The storms have pelted communities from the northern city of
Chihuahua to the southernmost state of Chiapas, turning streets
into swirling rivers and hillside villages into mud slides. Several
low-lying areas of Mexico City have also been hard-hit by rains.
</P>
<P>
   Although rainshowers are common from the months of June to
October, this year's storms have been particularly heavy, fueled
largely by large hurricanes and tropical storms that have battered
both the Pacific and Gulf coasts. Southern states were being hit by
Tropical Storm Javier, southwest of Baja California, while most
northern and eastern areas were preparing for Tropical Storm
Frances in the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The worst-hit area has been Chiapas, the center of a 4-year-old
anti-government insurgency, where about 30 storm-related deaths
have been reported and more than 60 people are still missing.
Tapachula, near the Guatemalan border, received 18 inches of rain
over the past four days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Literally hundreds of communities have been left isolated,''
Zedillo told reporters after touring the state by helicopter
Thursday. ``We are facing a very grave problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In the town of Pijijiapan, near the Pacific Coast, 18 people
have died, including a police officer who drowned during a rescue
mission. Chiapas Gov. Roberto Albores Guillen said that more than
25,000 people in more than 50 villages were driven from their homes
by the floods.
</P>
<P>
   The floods in Chiapas also postponed a tour that Mexican
government officials had scheduled for 40 diplomats, including US
Ambassador Jefferey Davidow. The Red Cross has made constant pleas
for donations, especially from residents in the country's largest
cities.
</P>
<P>
   The storms have affected other areas of the country. Hundreds of
residents were evacuated from vulnerable areas in Acapulco. A
9-year-old boy died after being swept away by an overflowing ditch
in the northern state of Sonora. And the shipping ports in the
eastern state of Tamaulipas were closed because of choppy waters.
</P>
<P>
   Similar to the criticism that government and disaster officials
heard when a rash of spring brush fires grew out of control because
of drought conditions, residents north and south have been quick to
criticize government officials for either failing to give people
adequate warning or for acting too slowly once the storms hit.
</P>
<P>
   During the tour, Zedillo ordered 1,100 troops and two airplanes
filled doctors and supplies be sent to Chiapas. A government
spokesman Thursday said other areas that have been hard hit by the
storms are also receiving assistance as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can never precisely predict where or how hard a storm
might land,'' said a public health official who requested
anonymity. ``We're fighting heavy rains, wind and difficult
terrain. We're doing our best.''

GOP LEADERS RALLY BEHIND TAX-CUT PLAN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAVID IVANOVICH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House and Senate leaders said Thursday they have
agreed to push for a $70 billion to $80 billion tax-cut plan that
would provide relief for married couples, senior citizens and
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Overcoming previous reservations, Senate leaders have accepted a
House plan to use part of the anticipated $1.6 trillion budget
surplus to pay for the five-year tax package and to attempt an even
bigger tax cut next year.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., after meeting with
House Republicans, said the tax-cut effort ``is in the best
interests of the people and the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee and the chief tax writer in the House, said he plans to
reveal specific details about a tax package this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But lawmakers said a centerpiece of the tax package will be
reduction of the so-called ``marriage penalty,'' the feature of the
tax code that forces couples with two bread winners to pay more in
federal taxes than if the partners were single.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, the marriage penalty will be something we
address,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   To help reduce the marriage penalty, Rep. Sam Johnson, R-Texas,
and Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., have proposed boosting the
standard deduction for couples filing jointly.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, an individual filing a single return can claim a
standard deduction of $4,250. A married couple filing a joint
return, however, can only claim $7,100, 16 percent less than if
they were filing as singles. The Johnson and Johnson proposal would
allow married couples to claim a full $8,500 for their standard
deduction.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would reduce the federal tax bill for about 24
million couples and would cost federal coffers about $26 billion
over five years.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate leaders also said the tax package would likely
include a provision to raise the salary ceiling for senior citizens
who continue to work, allowing them to earn more before beginning
to lose Social Security benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Seniors between ages 65 and 69 currently lose $1 worth of Social
Security benefits for every $3 they earn above a threshold of
$14,500. The proposal would raise that ceiling to $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans also want to allow self-employed workers and
employees whose companies do not provide health care coverage to
deduct the health care premiums they pay.
</P>
<P>
   The tax plan also is likely to provide help for American farmers
hurt by this year's drought and suffering from low commodity prices
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has assailed that idea of a tax cut this fall,
arguing that the surplus should be used to shore up Social Security
and provide funds for ``emergency'' measures, such as aid to
farmers and an effort to beef up protection at U.S. embassies in
the wake of the bombings in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president believes that it is unwise for Congress to waive
the pay-as-you-go budget rules to pay for a pre-election tax cut,''
White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles said in a letter sent to
House Speaker Newt Gingrich on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this moment, given the world economic situation, the United
States should not send a signal that we are backing off of the
basic fiscal discipline that has strengthened our economy,'' Bowles
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest obstacle in the Senate will be a 60-vote hurdle that
must be overcome to ensure that opponents do not block the measure.
Republicans are hopeful that popular measures, such as the marriage
penalty relief, will bring minority members on board.
</P>
<P>
   Archer has been forced to rein in conservatives' expectations
about how much tax relief can be accomplished this year.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, possibly around April 15, Republicans plan to try to
pass another, much larger tax cut. Lott said lawmakers will ``look
very seriously next year at a rate cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Such across-the-board proposals, however, are quite expensive. A
suggested 10 percent tax cut, for example, could cost about $600
billion over 10 years, Archer said.
</P>
<P>
   With talk of a possible impeachment of the president swirling
around Capitol Hill, lawmakers took great pains Thursday to
emphasize they are not being distracted away from other issues,
such as tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``In reality, we are not being deterred from doing the
substantive work we otherwise would be doing,'' Archer said. ``This
issue of possible impeachment is a compartmentalized issue'' to be
handled by the House Judiciary Committee.

 E. COLI BACTERIA CAN BE ELIMINATED FROM CATTLE, RESEARCHERS FIND 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JANE E. BRODY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microbiologists at Cornell University have found a way to
virtually rid cattle of harmful strains of E. coli bacteria,
including the bacteria that have caused scores of deaths and
sickened thousands of consumers of undercooked hamburgers.
</P>
<P>
   Their studies, described in Friday's issue of the journal
Science, demonstrated that the grain-based feedlot diet usually fed
to cattle before slaughter fosters the growth of E. coli bacteria,
some of which can cause disease. Among the dangerous strains that
can survive when cattle are fed grain is E. coli O157:H7, the most
deadly E. coli known.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were met with enthusiasm by both the cattle
industry and food safety experts.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said in a statement, ``This
deceptively simple finding, if confirmed by further research, has
the potential to greatly assist our efforts to fight food-borne
illness.''
</P>
<P>
   Grain feeding helps make beef tender and fatty and is considered
the most economical way to feed cattle before slaughter. But the
researchers found that if cattle were switched to a diet of hay or
fresh grass for five days before slaughter, the possibility of
infection from meat contaminated with the deadly strain could all
but be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Russell, an Agriculture Department microbiologist who
teaches at Cornell, explained that when cattle ate grain, the acid
level of their colon rose and fostered the growth of acid-resistant
bacteria, which could include the highly virulent E. coli O157:H7.
This organism could remain alive in the animal's fecal matter and
accidentally contaminate meat during slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Acidity in the animal's colon, Russell said, ``turns on E.
coli's acid-resistant genes, which allows them to survive in the
human stomach.'' Normally, stomach acid is an effective barrier to
infection by food-borne pathogens because the organisms die in an
acid environment.
</P>
<P>
   Most cases of infectious food poisoning require consumption of
about 10,000 microorganisms, but as few as 10 E. coli O157:H7 cells
can make a person deathly ill, Russell said. The organism is made
even more dangerous by its capacity to survive the journey through
the acid juices in the human stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Bacteria on the surface of meat are destroyed by the heat of
cooking. But if the organisms get mixed into foods like hamburgers,
they can survive the cooking process unless the meat is well done
throughout. Other occasional sources of infection by E. coli
O157:H7 are vegetables grown in fields fertilized by cattle manure,
unpasteurized fruit juices and contaminated water from wells,
lakes, water parks and swimming pools.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Buchanan, a microbiologist at the Food and Drug
Administration, said the proposed change in feeding could be ``an
extremely practical, cost-effective intervention'' but also
emphasized the need for further study.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   E. coli are normal inhabitants of the human digestive tract, but
only certain strains can cause illness. E. coli O157:H7 produces a
toxin that attacks the gastrointestinal tract and can cause severe
cramping, abdominal pain, watery or bloody diarrhea, vomiting or
fever. It can also cause kidney failure, which is fatal in as many
as 30 percent of cases.
</P>
<P>
   In the Cornell studies, conducted by Dr. Francisco
Diez-Gonsalez, Todd Callaway and Menas Kizoulis along with Russell,
researchers showed that when cattle were fed grains until
slaughter, the acid level rose in the colon enough to permit the
growth of about 100 million E. coli cells, about a million of which
were acid-resistant and able to withstand the acidity of the human
stomach.
</P>
<P>
   But when the animals were fed hay for just five days, only about
10,000 E. coli cells were present, and virtually none had the
potential to become acid resistant, Russell said in an interview.
The researchers wrote that ``virtually all'' the surviving bacteria
were killed by a dose of acid comparable to what is found in the
human stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Russell said the colon contents of cattle became acidic on a
diet of grain because the animals incompletely digested the starch
in grains. This permits some starch to reach the colon where
bacteria can ferment it and produce fermentation acids. But on a
diet of hay, there is no residual starch to be fermented in the
colon. Thus, the acid level remains low and the E. coli remain
acid-sensitive. The result is a million-fold fewer acid-resistant
E. coli cells in hay-fed cattle, the researchers found.
</P>
<P>
   Russell pointed out that only a very small percentage of cattle
_ ``only about 1 to 2 percent'' _ harbor the deadly E. coli, but
that ``when animals go to slaughter, no one knows which ones they
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gary Weber, executive director for regulatory affairs at the
National Cattlemen's Beef Association in Washington called the
findings ``exciting and very promising,'' but added that further
study was needed ``to see how it might work in full-scale farm and
ranch feeding systems'' and whether other techniques might work on
acidity.
</P>
<P>
   If further research confirms the value of the early findings,
the Department of Agriculture could recommend changes in the way
the cattle are fed, but it now lacks the authority to mandate such
a change, the association said.
</P>
<P>
   Although it may seem easier to control E. coli infections by
improving the hygiene in slaughter houses, Russell said that even
in the most hygienic establishments it is nearly impossible to
prevent all fecal contamination of meat.
</P>
<P>
   In their journal report, the researchers noted that ``because
grain feeding promotes both the production and efficiency of
cattle, it is unlikely that American cattle will ever be fed diets
consisting only of hay.'' But, they added, based on their results
``cattle could be given hay for a brief period immediately before
slaughter to reduce the risk of food-borne E. coli infection.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, this brief diet of hay ``should not affect either
carcass size or meat quality,'' said Dr. Donald Beermann, professor
of animal science at Cornell. Beermann added that the dietary
change would involve ``minimal expense and inconvenience to feedlot
operators.''

WORRISOME NEWS SENDS STOCK PRICES INTO DIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER G. GOSSELIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK -- Rattled by the possibility that President Clinton
could be forced from office and by sharp losses in foreign markets,
investors took cover Thursday, sending US stock prices tumbling and
erasing gains made at the start of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Brokers and traders braced for another rocky session Friday,
when Independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr's report on the Clinton
scandal was expected to be released. ``If there's anything that's
new and enlightening in that report, it's certainly going to affect
the market negatively,'' said Kathleen Camilli, chief economist
with Tucker Anthony Inc. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average of 30 blue-chip stocks lost
249.48 points, or 3.2 percent, to close at 7615.54. Coming atop
earlier losses, the Dow has given back all of its record 380-point
gain on Tuesday and more. It is now down almost 4 percent for the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Other major market measures fell sharply. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 was off 2.6 percent for the day, though it is still up 1
percent for the year. The Nasdaq Composite was down 2.4 percent
Thursday but is up 0.95 percent since Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   There was some positive news late in the day, however, when
Intel Corp. and Oracle Corp., two top technology companies, issued
upbeat financial results, which could reassure investors.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the threat of Clinton's impeachment comes at an
extremely difficult time for investors and the world economy.
Although the United States continues growing, a financial crisis
that began in Thailand 14 months ago has now reached much of the
rest of the world, most recently Latin America, and economic
policymakers from the United States and other major powers have yet
to prove they can halt its spread.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a world-class financial crisis on our hands that's
unprecedented in breadth and depth, and it is increasingly urgent
that global policymakers do something,'' said Stephen S. Roach,
chief economist with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Discover in New
York. But so far leaders of most of the major nations, most
especially Clinton, have been preoccupied with political concerns,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although stocks bounced back from their worst moments of the day
-- at one point the Dow was down more than 330 points -- analysts
said that signs abounded investors were scrambling for safety in
the face of the president's problems and worsening conditions
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   -- Money poured into US bonds, a traditional haven in times of
troubles, sending the market interest rate on them to record
lows. &UR;  &LR; The value of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 1 3/32
points, or $10.94 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves
in the opposite direction, fell to 5.20 percent from 5.27 percent,
its lowest level since the government began issuing the bond on a
regular basis in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are looking for safety. They don't want to make money
right now; they just want to avoid losing it,'' said Kendrick D.
Anderson, fixed-income director for Evergreen Asset Management Corp
in Purchase, N.Y., which manages $12.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   -- The US dollar, which many foreigners used as a safe haven
until recently, making it spectacularly strong, fell to a 15-month
low against the German mark as well as dropping against other major
currencies. Although part of the decline was traceable to
suggestions the Federal Reserve may lower US interest rates, a move
that would make it less profitable to hold dollars, analysts said
that the upheaval in Washington contributed. ``It looks like people
think the Deutsche mark is a safer haven than the dollar,'' said
Roger M. Kubarych, a former senior Fed official who is now a
partner with Kaufman &AMP; Kubarych, a New York investment firm.
</P>
<P>
   -- Stock markets across Europe skidded on news of Clinton's
problems and on worries about Russian President Boris Yeltsin's
choice of Yevgeny Primakov as prime minister. Thursday seemed to be
the first time that European investors entertained the notion that
Clinton's admitted affair with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky could force him from office. Primakov has shown almost no
interest in pushing Russia toward a market system and is a one-time
member of the KGB, the country's former spy agency. The German DAX
and the French CAC 40 indexes both lost more than 4 percent of
their value.
</P>
<P>
   -- Frightened by policymakers' unwillingness to act, investors
began bailing out of Latin America with a vengeance. Stock markets
in Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico lost 10 to 15 percent Thursday
alone, and there were signs that the turmoil would continue Friday.
Analysts said that the selloff was important because it is finally
bringing the Asia-sparked world financial crisis to America's door.
Latin America, together with Canada, which also faces increasing
economic trouble, buys one third of the nation's exports.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that, with the president occupied with his fight
to stay in office, other US policymakers, especially Fed chairman
Alan Greenspan, will have to step into the breach. ``Greenspan is
really the central banker for the world and the one who will have
to provide the leadership,'' said Harvard Business School professor
Samuel Hayes.
</P>
<P>
   But some wondered how much Greenspan and others can do without
effective backing from he White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is how long can we continue to prosper with
trouble all around us. In that context having a vacuum in political
leadership is not good,'' said Richard D. Rippe, chief economist
with Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alan Greenspan may be omniscient, but he's not omnipotent,''
said former Clinton domestic policy aide William A. Galston, now a
professor at the University of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain things that can only be done by a
president,'' Galston said, ``and these circumstances...make that
kind of aggressive purposeful leadership much more difficult.''

   WASHINGTON _ Since President Clinton's address to the nation
last month, in which he acknowledged having had an ``inappropriate
relationship'' with Monica Lewinsky, he has spoken several times
about his regrets and remorse. Following are excerpts from those
statements.
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 17 (in a televised address to the nation):
</P>
<P>
   ``Indeed, I did have a relationship with Ms. Lewinsky that was
not appropriate. In fact, it was wrong. It constituted a critical
lapse in judgment and a personal failure on my part for which I am
solely and completely responsible ... I know that my public
comments and my silence about this matter gave a false impression.
I misled people, including my wife. I deeply regret that.''
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 28 (speaking at an event in Oak Bluffs, Mass., that marked
the 35th anniversary of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s ``I Have
a Dream'' speech):
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing I learned, on which all these other things
depend, without which we cannot build a world of peace or one
America in an increasingly peaceful world bound together in this
web of mutuality, is that you can't get there unless you're willing
to forgive your enemies. All of you know I'm having to become quite
an expert in this business of asking for forgiveness. And, I _ it
gets a little easier the more you do it ... And so, it is important
that we are able to forgive those we believe have wronged us, even
as we ask for forgiveness from people we have wronged.''
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 2 (at a Kremlin news conference in Moscow):
</P>
<P>
   ``I have acknowledged that I made a mistake, said that I
regretted it, asked to be forgiven, spent a lot of very valuable
time with my family in the last couple of weeks and said I was
going back to work ... I read it the other day again, and I thought
it was clear that I was expressing my profound regret to all who
were hurt and to all who were involved, and my desire not to see
any more people hurt by this process and caught up in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 4 (during a picture-taking session in Dublin with Prime
Minister Bertie Ahern of Ireland):
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already said that I made a bad mistake, it was
indefensible and I'm sorry about it. So I have nothing else to say
except that I can't disagree with anyone else who wants to be
critical of what I have already acknowledged was indefensible ...
But there's nothing that he or anyone else could say in a
personally critical way that I _ that I don't imagine that I would
disagree with, since I have already said it myself, to myself. And
I'm very sorry about it. There's nothing else I could say.''
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 9 (at an afternoon fund-raiser in Orlando, Fla., for Lt.
Gov. Buddy Mackay, the Democratic candidate for governor):
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been your friend. I've done my best to be your friend.
But I also let you down, and I let my family down, and I let this
country down. But I'm trying to make it right. And I'm determined
never to let anything like that happen again ... So I ask for your
understanding, for your forgiveness on this journey we're on. I
hope this will be a time of reconciliation and healing and I hope
that millions of families all over America are in a way growing
stronger because of this.''
</P>
<P>
   And at an evening fund-raiser for Mackay in Coral Gables, Fla.:
</P>
<P>
   ``All of you know that I've been on a rather painful journey
these last few weeks, and I've had to ask for things that I was
more in the habit of giving in my life than asking for, in terms of
understanding and forgiveness ... I've tried to do a good job
taking care of this country, even when I haven't taken such good
care of myself and my family, my obligations. I hope that you and
others I have injured will forgive me for the mistakes I've made.''

CLINTON TURNS TO PASTORS FOR SOLACE  
 PROMINENT CLERGYMAN SAYS CLINTON SHOULD RESIGN  
 MRS. CLINTON COMMENTS ON REPORTERS AND COLON CANCER 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton is seeking solace and forgiveness
wherever he can find it, liberally spreading his contrition around
to politicians and preachers alike.
</P>
<P>
   Among those Clinton has consulted in recent days are a number of
clergymen with whom he has developed close relationships over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   Since his televised confessional Aug. 17, the president has
spoken with the Rev. J. Philip Wogaman, pastor of Foundry United
Methodist Church in Washington, which Clinton frequently attends
with Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Wogaman would not reveal the specific contents of their
discussion, but he described Clinton's recent repentance as
``sincere'' and said the president was engaged in a ``serious
self-examination.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that Clinton had broken off his relationship with Monica
Lewinsky last year and had begun privately seeking forgiveness for
the affair long before it became public last January.
</P>
<P>
   Wogaman, a prominent Protestant theologian who is often
criticized as excessively liberal in his reading of Scripture, said
that he was disappointed in the president's behavior. But he also
said it would be wrong to judge a man ``simply on the basis of his
worst flaws.'' He added that he believed it would be a tragic
mistake to force Clinton out of office over the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Some advisers to the president have suggested that Clinton will
use a scheduled prayer breakfast at the White House on Friday
morning to ask the clergymen and the nation for absolution from his
sins.
</P>
<P>
   One adviser said Clinton was considering asking a minister to
serve as a family counselor to help him rebuild the trust he
shattered by his admitted relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The adviser said that Clinton was particularly drawn to the Rev.
Tony Campolo, a charismatic preacher and sociology professor at
Eastern College in St. Davids, Pa., and might ask him to serve as
the family's spiritual adviser. Campolo did not return phone calls
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   PROMINENT CLERGYMAN SAYS CLINTON SHOULD RESIGN
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has also sought spiritual guidance in the past from the
Rev. Robert Schuller, senior pastor of the Crystal Cathedral in
Garden Grove, Calif. Clinton is an admirer of Schuller and took his
suggestion of a Biblical verse to include in his State of the Union
address last year.
</P>
<P>
   The line was from Isaiah: ``You shall be called the repairer of
the breach and the restorer of paths to dwell in.''
</P>
<P>
   But the president is unlikely to welcome the advice that
Schuller has for him now.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Thursday, Schuller said Clinton had
opened a gaping breach of trust with his family and with the
nation, and suggested that the only way to swiftly repair that
breach is by resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to ask himself whether he will heal the breach through
extended impeachment hearings, or whether prolonging this will make
it deeper and uglier,'' Schuller said. ``I think he will have to
ask the question, `If I resign, will that give me an opportunity to
close the presidency with more honor and dignity than if I wait it
out and fight it through?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Schuller said he had called the White House on Thursday and was
awaiting a call back from the president, during which he will pose
those questions. He said that he had concluded what the answers
should be, but added that it would be ``impertinent'' to tell
Clinton what he should do.
</P>
<P>
   But he asked, again rhetorically, whether fighting a protracted
impeachment battle would yield at best a ``Pyrrhic victory'' that
would leave the country in trauma and the president's reputation in
tatters.
</P>
<P>
   Schuller said he met with the president in the Oval Office
earlier this year and the president vehemently denied a sexual
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did it with such passion and with his eyes locked on me,''
Schuller said. ``He lied. Blatantly. He's the third public man to
do that to me _ Nixon and Agnew lied to me, bluntly, boldly. And
now Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuller suggested that Clinton's marital infidelity may have
cost him the trust not only of his family but of the nation at
large.
</P>
<P>
   ``From all my years as a pastor and a marriage counselor, I've
learned one thing, and that's if people commit adultery and do it
more than once, you can never trust them again,'' Schuller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a corner of your life called the trusting corner,'' he
added, ``and you can never let them in again.''
</P>
<P>
   MRS. CLINTON COMMENTS ON REPORTERS AND COLON CANCER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the penitential President, Mrs. Clinton has maintained a
stoic public facade. But Thursday afternoon she let slip the mask
at a White House event to increase awareness of colorectal cancer
and to urge Americans to be screened for the disease. She revealed
a deep bitterness at Clinton's acknowledged betrayal. But her anger
was not directed at her husband. She saved her scorn for the media
and she expressed it in a graphic way.
</P>
<P>
   The East Room event _ featuring ``Today'' show host Katie
Couric, whose husband, Jay Monahan, died of colon cancer this year
_ drew an unusually large press contingent. Reporters and
photographers were curious to see how Mrs. Clinton was bearing up
under the strain of the Lewinsky case a day before the release of
the independent counsel's report, which promised damaging new
revelations about the affair.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton scanned the room and sarcastically declared herself
``thrilled by the concern the press is showing for colon cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   As the event ended, Mrs. Clinton invited her guests to a
reception and a receiving line in the Blue Room. Then she
tauntingly invited members of the press into the Green Room to
undergo a rectal probe to screen for the disease.

POLITICAL TROUBLES NOT AFFECTING ECONOMY LIKE THEY DID IN WATERGATE
ERA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK DAVIS  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: The last time a U.S. president stood this close to
impeachment _ Richard Nixon in the Watergate scandal _ the stock
market crumbled.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street's bear market of 1973 and 1974, considered the worst
in a generation, competed with Watergate for the nation's
attention. But it needn't be that way again, say stock market
watchers amid questions about Bill Clinton's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, stocks plunged again Thursday after independent
counsel Kenneth Starr's report to Congress of evidence that Clinton
committed offenses that might warrant impeachment. The Dow Jones
industrial average fell 249.48 points, erasing the last of the
Dow's record 380-point gain on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But these wild swings in stock prices are just ``the jitters,''
said Gerald L. Miller, economics professor at Rockhurst College in
Kansas City, Mo. He said stocks were reflecting investors' mood
swings rather than the economy, which remained sound. The future
for stocks looks promising, if not for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in one of the best, if not the best, economic
circumstances the United States has ever been in,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Others say a quick end to Clinton's presidency might even help
stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   David Mead, chief investment strategist at Harris Bank in
Chicago, said Republicans could gain a veto-proof congressional
majority in fall elections if Clinton is forced to resign by then.
That, Mead said, almost certainly would lead to capital gains tax
cuts, and that would buoy stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   The other side of the coin, however, is less promising. If it
takes the nation months to resolve Clinton's future, the
overhanging uncertainty will continue to weigh on stock prices, the
market experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Left to fester, it might even distract the nation enough that
the economy could succumb to existing foreign threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration's in a real quandary,'' Mead said.
``They're focused on other things at a time when they should be
focused on foreign affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Most stocks have been sliding since April, and the popular Dow
Jones index has fallen 18.4 percent from a peak in mid-July. Most
worries center on Asia, which has struggled with an economic crisis
since last year.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's political unrest and economic turmoil have added to the
U.S. stock market's worries. And now Latin America has caught the
``Asian contagion.'' Brazil's stock market plunged 14.6 percent on
Thursday, and Mexico's fell 9.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not a repeat of Nixon, Watergate and that big bear
market, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a period of tremendous fundamental challenges (to the
economy), and we don't see that today,'' said Mike Kenneally, chief
investment officer of NationsBank Private Investments in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The 1973 oil embargo had ignited rampant inflation and ground
the economy to a halt. Interest rates jumped. Manufacturers' energy
costs soared. American automakers tried feebly to shift from
gasoline-guzzling to fuel-efficient engines, while Japanese imports
stole their customers.
</P>
<P>
   These matters weren't resolved quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was really a long, dark stretch as far as the economy was
concerned,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Today's economic threats are indirect. Exports to Asian
countries have fallen sharply since the economic crisis there. And
the economies in Latin America, another significant trading partner
with the United States, are struggling with debt problems and
rapidly eroding confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil is important,'' Mead said. ``You're seeing almost
wanton (financial) destruction there.''
</P>
<P>
   Add to that environment Congress' consideration of Starr's
report and Clinton's repeated public apologies for his relationship
with Monica Lewinsky, and it's easy to see why investors are losing
some confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneally said investors' attitudes were shifting toward seeing
the glass half empty instead of half full, though the amount of
water in the glass remained the same.

   Anthony O'Bryan, a market analyst at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in
St. Louis, said foreign investors in particular were selling stock
in U.S. markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're taking this thing very seriously,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Calm these worries, however, and the Dow Jones could easily
climb back above 9,000 and challenge 10,000, Miller said. The U.S.
economy is that good. Inflation and interest rates are that low.
Employment is that high.
</P>
<P>
   And many expect the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates
further when its policy committee meets late this month.
</P>
<P>
   Mead agreed with Miller, saying stocks were starting to look
cheap. That doesn't mean, he cautioned, that they can't get
cheaper, even starkly underpriced.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneally called it ``a rather unpleasant opportunity'' for
long-term investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one likes to step up (and buy stocks) when they're not
certain what's happening,'' he said. ``You have to go against the
world to do that.''

 &HT;    Pro-life groups distributes anti-abortion literature at local
high school
 &HT;    By Doug Payne
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A half-dozen Cobb County and school police officers kept wary
watch on an equal number of abortion protesters Thursday morning as
the group passed out anti-abortion literature to Osborne High
School students arriving for class.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth time since schools reopened that the group has
appeared at a Cobb County high school to hand out pamphlets to
students.
</P>
<P>
   An Aug. 27 effort to distribute safe sex and anti-abortion
brochures at Marietta High School was cut short when city police
served a temporary restraining order to the group prohibiting them
from ``demonstrating their views concerning the issue of abortion''
in a disruptive manner.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the group, led by Michael and Michelle Wolven of
Powder Springs, described themselves as ``pro-life sidewalk
counselors'' and ``missionaries to the pre-born,'' and denied
affiliation with any organized anti-abortion groups such as
Operation Rescue.
</P>
<P>
   They passed out pamphlets on abortion and safe sex while
displaying graphic posters of aborted fetuses to people driving
past or bringing children to the high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just concerned citizens who have come together on this
issue,'' said Michael Wolven. However, he acknowledged that the
practice of pamphleteering high school students is in line with
Operation Rescue's national campaign to ``bring God back into
school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen teenage girls go into abortion clinics and come
out with tears in their eyes,'' he said. ``We feel it's time to
start teaching these teenagers and show them the truth about
abortion.'' The mother of one student objected to their presence at
the school. ``You don't put sex education on a street corner like
some drug dealer,'' said Phyllis Parrish, who added that she had no
problem with the protesters' message, only the venue they had
chosen to present it.
</P>
<P>
   She was the only person to raise an objection. Students who
walked to school accepted the information handed out by the
crusaders with a smile _ until they opened it up and saw pictures
of bloody fetuses.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, several students expressed support for the group's
goals. Nichole Lewis, a junior, said she found a picture of an
aborted fetus ``disgusting,'' but thinks the abortion issue is one
that should be discussed in high school, as long as it's kept in
the upper classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some freshmen who don't know about this stuff,'' she
said.

 &HT;    HEROs even help motorists who have ruffled feathers
 &HT;    By Joey Ledford
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Atlanta's HEROs have more than their share of what I call tales
of the road.
</P>
<P>
   In their three years of patroling metro freeways and aiding
stranded motorists, the Highway Emergency Response Operators have
just about seen it all.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hendon, who heads the Department of Transportation's
popular traffic management unit, shared some HERO war stories in a
recent speech to a group of transportation professionals. My
favorite involved a HEROic encounter with a most unusual adversary.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our HEROs happened to see a vehicle start driving
erratically,'' said Hendon. ``They pulled over to the shoulder of
I-20 and called in that this lady's macaw bird had gotten out of
the cage and was giving her trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Former HERO Nathan Gaskin, a 6-foot-5, 300-pound giant of a man,
was called in as a backup and decided he would try to recapture the
macaw, a substantial and quite aggressive parrot.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, 'I'll get that bird,' `` said Hendon.
</P>
<P>
   Gaskin climbed into the midsize sedan and struggled to grab the
flapping, excited bird. He finally prevailed, but not without claw
and beak wounds to his hand, ears and face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout the whole thing, the lady is hollering, 'Don't hurt
my bird,' `` said Hendon.
</P>
<P>
   A bleeding Gaskin finally got the macaw back into its cage. No
one ever figured out how it had escaped.
</P>
<P>
   ``She expressed her appreciation, and drove right off,'' said
Hendon.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this summer, HEROs again solved an animal problem. A
large truck carrying a number of cattle overturned on the ramp
between I-285 and I-20, and there was literally a huge pile of
grounded beef.
</P>
<P>
   It was a hot day and things were not looking good for the
livestock.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fire Department said they could use their exhaust fans to
keep them cool,'' said Hendon, but there was no power source. So a
HERO truck, which carries a portable generator typically used to
power lights and illuminate fatal accident scenes so they can be
investigated, backed up close to the toppled livestock truck and
connected the fans to the generator.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were piled on top of each other, but they were cool,''
said Hendon. The cattle were successfully offloaded into another
truck.
</P>
<P>
   On two occasions HEROs have successfully gotten expectant
mothers, who had the misfortune of going into labor on the freeway,
to the hospital in time.
</P>
<P>
   On another occasion, Rudy Bledsoe, who is now Hendon's
assistant, came to the aid of an expectant mother with morning
sickness.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived at her door at the worst possible moment and
sustained a badly soiled uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave him a hard time about that one,'' said Hendon.
</P>
<P>
   On two other occasions, HEROs investigating apparently abandoned
vehicles came upon bad guys who pulled guns on them. In both cases,
they were in the act of stripping the cars, which happens all too
frequently along Atlanta freeways.
</P>
<P>
   ``You leave one overnight and when you come back, you won't have
wheels on it, that's for sure,'' said Hendon.
</P>
<P>
   Both HEROs escaped injury in the armed gunmen cases.
</P>
<P>
   On another occasion, a HERO inspecting what appeared to be a
deserted vehicle found it was not deserted at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stopped and looked into it and there were two females,
completely nude, asleep in the back seat,'' said Hendon. ``We
called the police on that one.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all in a day's work when you're a HERO.

 &HT;    New AGL president faces challenge of deregulation
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paula G. Rosput, a senior executive with Charlotte-based Duke
Energy Corp., was named president and chief operating officer
Thursday of Atlanta Gas Light Co. and will lead Georgia's largest
gas utility into a new era of deregulation and competition.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment is part of a series of management changes by
Walter M. Higgins since he took over in February as president and
chief executive officer of AGL Resources Inc., the gas company's
parent.
</P>
<P>
   Rosput, 41, will be one of the top-ranking women in Atlanta
business circles when she moves into the executive suite Sept. 21
of AGL's largest subsidiary, which accounts for $1.2 billion of
AGL's $1.3 billion in annual revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997, Rosput has been president of Duke Energy Power
Services, based in Houston, and managed a network of independent
electric power plants valued at $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Rosput said she will work to educate the gas company's 1.4
million customers and 2,200 employees about the benefits of
deregulation, build a ``positive and honest relationship'' with the
Public Service Commission, operate with ``openness'' and help
revive AGL's flagging stock price. ``The fact of the matter is that
everybody's not happy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosput succeeds Catherine Land-Waters, who has served as acting
president since replacing Thomas Benson in a management shake-up
last May. Benson, a 28-year-veteran of Atlanta Gas Light, was
president for 11 months.
</P>
<P>
   Initial reaction to the appointment was positive.
</P>
<P>
   PSC Chairman Dave Baker, who last week charged during a flap
over Atlanta Gas Light's rates that the company had ``duped'' the
commission, said he hopes the appointment will open a ``new
chapter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She'll come with some fresh ideas on how to put the company
back on track,'' added Donato J. Eassey, an industry analyst with
Merrill Lynch Global Securities in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Livia Whisenhunt, president of PS Energy Group, an Atlanta-based
gas marketing company that has extensive dealings with AGL,
applauded the selection of a woman. ``Some of the inflexibilities
of the past may be re-evaluated,'' she said. ``Women certainly have
a different perspective on business and marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosput joins AGL at a time of unprecedented change. Under a
state deregulation law that takes effect Nov. 1, the company exits
the sales business and will be responsible only for transporting
gas to homes and businesses. Marketing companies will compete to
sell gas at decontrolled prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Georgia moving to broad-based deregulation, how AGL
responds to that is critical. I hope my experience with
deregulation will serve customers well in that goal,'' Rosput said
in a telephone interview from Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Rosput said she has been struck during recent visits to Atlanta
by the ``booming growth'' in the metro area. ``But the company has
not been a beneficiary of that growth,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   AGL shares have lost more than 6 percent of their value over the
last five years while the metro Atlanta population has grown by
15.5 percent. During the same period, AGL was ranked by Standard &AMP;
Poors as the second-worst performer among nine peer gas utilities.
AGL Resources closed Wednesday at $18.18 3/4, down 6 1/4 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins personally recruited Rosput for AGL. They met in 1995
when Rosput was an executive at an Oregon-based gas pipeline
company, and the Nevada utility then headed by Higgins was a
customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her wealth of experience in gas and electric utilities,
natural gas pipelines and competitive energy businesses will help
the company as it prepares for the rapidly changing and
increasingly competitive utility industry,'' said Higgins, who
remains as chief executive of both AGL Resources and the gas
company subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Rosput declined comment on her compensation and other terms of
employment, but Benson received $303,538 in salary and bonuses as
AGL president during fiscal 1997.

 &HT;    A drag on the market
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the stock market already dropping like a rock _ the Dow
Jones industrial average fell another 3 percent Thursday _ talk of
impeaching President Clinton was the last thing Wall Street
investors needed to hear.
</P>
<P>
   The last time something similar happened _ under President Nixon
_ the Dow tumbled almost 41 percent during the course of the
political trauma, said stock market historian Yale Hirsch.
</P>
<P>
   There haven't been many White House scandals that had a
demonstrable impact on the stock market, said Hirsch, but all of
them were painful.
</P>
<P>
   Do investors face a repeat under Clinton of the Watergate
experience, which ended with Nixon's resignation on Aug. 9, 1974?
</P>
<P>
   Is it just coincidence the Dow has dropped close to 20 percent
since mid-July, as special prosecutor Kenneth Starr was wrapping up
his investigation of Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   If Watergate is the model, the answer is that an impeachment or
resignation threat certainly contributed to the market's decline,
but was not the main reason.
</P>
<P>
   The Nixon economy was already in an oil-price-generated
recession by the time the House started impeachment hearings in
1974, and as a result Wall Street would suffer back-to-back bear
markets from late 1971 through most of 1976.
</P>
<P>
   There are few economic parallels between Clinton's situation and
Nixon's: There's no Cold War now, the economy is expanding,
inflation is minimal and interest rates are low.
</P>
<P>
   But stocks are falling, investor sentiment is turning bearish,
and there is substantial foreign economic weakness that could pose
a long-term threat to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts give little or no credit to Clinton for the 1990s
bull market _ unlike Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan _ so
they don't blame him for the latest sell-off.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts blame the latest selling on the spread of a
profit-hurting Asian flu to Russia and Latin America, which
punctured Wall Street's speculative bubble.
</P>
<P>
   The real danger from Clinton's troubles, according to analysts,
is the absence of White House leadership at a time of growing
international crisis. Where can investors turn for some
confidence-restoring reassurance?
</P>
<P>
   ``A presidential resignation or impeachment may not have a
direct impact on the economy, but a void in leadership at a time
when the world needs leadership would,'' said Phillip Larkins,
strategist for Atlanta-based Legacy South.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts say the uncertainty surrounding Clinton's future
has the biggest impact on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, Wall Street would get a boost from any Republican
gains in the November elections due to fallout from Clinton's
troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, said Larkins, ``this is going to be a messy
thing that won't be solved judiciously and quickly.''

 &HT;    MindSpring to buy rival Net provider Sprynet
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MindSpring Enterprises announced a deal Thursday to buy Sprynet,
one of the nation's largest independent Internet service providers,
paying up to $45 million for the company now owned by America
Online.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement will likely bring MindSpring the lion's share of
Sprynet's 180,000 subscribers _ by far the largest acquisition the
company has made. The largest previous deal brought MindSpring
about 42,000 subscribers from PSInet two years ago. It caused
painful upheaval within MindSpring as the business adjusted.
</P>
<P>
   Although much of MindSpring's rapid growth has come through
acquisitions, the company has labored to retain a reputation for
sterling customer service. MindSpring founder and Chairman Charles
Brewer said he does not expect that shining image to be threatened
by a replay of the earlier trouble. ``I think we are better
prepared, and this is a much less daunting task than PSI.''
</P>
<P>
   That PSI deal virtually doubled MindSpring's size. But now
MindSpring is one of the nation's largest Internet providers, with
about 400,000 subscribers. And while most are in the Southeast,
MindSpring has customers throughout the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Sprynet customers are scattered, mostly in California, Texas,
New York, Florida and Washington. Sprynet's headquarters is in
Seattle, and while the company will lose its corporate identity,
MindSpring plans to use its call center in Seattle. MindSpring also
expects to keep better than half the nearly 200 Sprynet employees,
adding to its 650-person work force.
</P>
<P>
   How much MindSpring will pay for Sprynet depends on how many of
the unit's subscribers end up as MindSpring customers. Brewer said
MindSpring should wind up with more than 140,000 new subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Sprynet has not released financial results, but Brewer said he
is confident the company will be a boost to both revenues and
earnings under MindSpring ownership.
</P>
<P>
   A ``pure'' Internet provider like MindSpring or Earthlink,
Sprynet offers access to the Net as well as e-mail. AOL, which has
13 million members, is an online service that provides Net access
but is best known for proprietary services like news and chat that
are available only to members.

NOT MUCH WORKS IN `SIMON BIRCH'  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Disney's heart-warming wannabe, ``Simon Birch,'' is ``suggested
by'' (whatever that means) a novel by John Irving, and has a few
flashes of the author's inspired sense of the absurd. But not many,
and the film is, mostly, agonizingly bad.
</P>
<P>
   It opens with a scene in which an emotional Jim Carrey, who also
acts as narrator throughout, sets up a long flashback. He plays it
straight, but his voice is so synonymous with anarchy that it
instantly establishes a tone of insincerity _ which builds as the
movie gets progressively maudlin.
</P>
<P>
   Set in a seaside town in Maine in the early '60s, it's the story
of two pre-teen best friends: Joe (Joseph Mazzello), who's grown up
well off but without a father; and the title character (Ian Michael
Smith), who is poorer and growth-impaired.
</P>
<P>
   But Simon believes God has a special purpose for him _ and so do
we, since Carrey (the grown-up version of Joe) tells us in the
first few minutes that the valiant little guy will fulfill that
special destiny. So the movie is a lot of waiting around for this
to happen.
</P>
<P>
   In modest defense of the film, it has a good supporting
performance from the reliable Oliver Platt, and a reasonably
endearing turn by Ashley Judd as Joe's nonconformist mother.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as the first directorial effort of Mark Steven Johnson, the
writer of the ``Grumpy Old Men'' movies, it might be better titled
``Grumpy Young Men.'' Like those films, its characters and humor
are broad and rather gross, its emotional scenes clumsy.
</P>
<P>
   It's a textbook case of bad screenwriting. For instance, the
film's dramatic tension depends on the fact that the local church
and its minister (David Strathairn) have absolute control over the
kids' lives, but it's never explained why.
</P>
<P>
   The other incongruities and inconsistencies and improbabilities
are almost too numerous to mention, but when Johnson has the church
leaders pick the heaviest kid in town _ a good 200 pounds _ to play
an angel suspended from the ceiling for the Christmas pageant (with
obvious disastrous results), you just want to scream ``oh, sure!''
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of the pageant, Johnson's idea of humor is having
his 11-year-old hero so overcome with lust in the midst of the
nativity scene (he plays the baby Jesus) that he has to reach out
and grab the breasts of the girl playing the Virgin Mary. Sexual
abuse is just hilarious when handicapped kids do it!
</P>
<P>
   A big part of the film's problem is that it utterly depends on
our finding its underdog, developmentally challenged hero
endearing. But, as written by Johnson and played by the adequate
but in no-way captivating Ian Michael Smith, he's rather obnoxious.
</P>
<P>
   Simon Birch. Directed and written by Mark Steven Johnson. Cast:
Ian Michael Smith, Joseph Mazzello, Ashley Judd, Oliver Platt, Jim
Carrey. Disney/Hollywood Pictures. 115 minutes. Rated PG for
language, emotionally thematic elements and an accident scene.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House on Thursday prepared to make public the
report by the Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, on
Friday by way of the Internet _ promising the nation an
extraordinary cyberspace look at the narrative that prosecutors say
provides ``substantial and credible'' evidence that could warrant
President Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Rebuffing efforts by Democrats to win even one hour in advance
of the report's release for the president and his lawyers to review
it, the Republican-controlled House Rules Committee on Thursday
night planned to send to the full House a resolution that would
allow immediate dissemination of the 445-page report that now
threatens the Clinton presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The House was expected to pass the measure easily on Friday, a
vote that will pave the way for the release within hours of a
report, that no member of Congress has yet seen, with no effort at
prior scrutiny or editing of any of the graphic details of
Clinton's liaison with Monica Lewinsky. The report's disclosure
poses new perils for Clinton, who faces a weekend full of
revelations made public in the independent counsel's findings.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts at forging a bipartisan approach to any impeachment
procedures were already fraying on Thursday. Rep. John Conyers,
Jr., the senior Democrat on the Judiciary Committee protested the
report's posting on the Web to the Rules Committee: ``The House of
Representatives is not the U.S. postal service. We are not a
delivery system for Kenneth W. Starr. We cannot, we ought not, we
should not, release anything to anybody unless we know what it is
we're releasing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committe chairman, Rep. Henry Hyde, however, told
the Rules Committee that ``it is important that we American people
learn the facts.'' He distinguished Starr's report from the still
sealed 2,000 pages of backup material and boxes of grand jury
testimony and videotapes also sent to Congress. Those were to be
put under the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee for review,
to be released on Sept. 28, unless the committee decided to hold
them back or edit them..
</P>
<P>
   Tensions ran high in the House _ particularly among Democrats _
as it faced the possibility of impeachment proceedings for the
first time since 1974 when President Richard Nixon resigned because
of the Watergate scandal.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the pressures felt by nervous Democrats worrying
how the scandal engulfing Clinton will affect their prospects in
elections just two months away, Democratic leaders expected many of
their party to vote for disclosure of Starr's report on Friday. And
a fraction of Democrats were among the voices calling for swift
disclosure, hoping to get the worst behind them as quickly as
possible.

STEREOTYPES ABOUND IN `LET'S TALK ABOUT SEX'' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What do women really want? Well, you certainly won't know after
watching actress-turned-director Troy Beyer's shiny but vapid
``Let's Talk About Sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Her take on the deep desires of the modern gal make Glenn Close
in ``Fatal Attraction'' look forward-thinking. In fact, I can't
think of another movie about women that so purports to be
progressive and provocative and yet subliminally enforces all the
negative female/male stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Let's Talk About Sex,'' women are desperate, emotional,
hormonal messes dependent upon the attentions of a man to make them
whole.
</P>
<P>
   Men in the movies spew locker-room banter about women and their
mythic sexual prowess. But is that real life? Truth is, fellas are
probably happier pondering the stock market crash after a rough
game of racketball.
</P>
<P>
   In this film, a Miami-based trio of pin-up worthy babes turn the
tables on the men. Writer Jazz (Beyer), model Lena (Randi Ingerman)
and club manager Michelle (Paget Brewster) are best friends and
roommates. Jazz has three days to prepare a demo-tape for a
potential TV show called ``Girl Talk'' at a local station. What
should it be about?
</P>
<P>
   Sex, sex and more sex is the answer. Jazz and her roomies hit
the streets, interviewing every available woman in sight. They ask
questions about likes, dislikes and all the rules of the mating and
dating game, when it comes to men, fantasies and other women, if
that shoe fits.
</P>
<P>
   Answers range from, ``Eternity is from the moment I come to when
I hear that front door close,'' to other achingly dull cliches
about orgasms and who puts the towel on the wet spot in the bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's Talk About Sex'' is a vacuous, air-headed treatise about
women's secret lives, wants and desires. It's based on high school
dreams of a perfect guy with a perfect body who will make
everything better. Even in a crisis, these seemingly intelligent,
beautiful women resort to cleaning, eating and crying while waiting
for the phone to ring.
</P>
<P>
   Let's Talk About Sex. Directed and writtem by Troy Beyer. Cast:
Beyer, Paget Brewster, Randi Ingerman. Fine Line Features. 82
minutes. Rated R for language, nudity, sexual themes.

CHARMLESS `LIVING IN CAPTIVITY' IS LOW BROW, BAD TASTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the early buzz on ``Living in Captivity'' hovered somewhere
between ``awful'' and ``awfully embarrassing,'' publicity people at
the Fox network went into rapid-response mode and dispatched two
more episodes in the hope of nudging the needle on the buzzometer
into friendlier territory.
</P>
<P>
   This is common practice when a pilot episode has all the charm
of a skin rash. The two backup episodes, sadly, were no
improvement. So the itch to get up and do some yard work, maybe
even paint the garage, has nothing to do with the show's
life-in-the-suburbs theme. It has everything to do with a blurring
of the line between high concept and low brow, between good
judgment and bad taste.
</P>
<P>
   While Fox is only too happy to remind us that ``Living in
Captivity'' is from Diane English and Joel Shukovsky _ the couple
that brought ``Murphy Brown'' to decadelong success _ it is
instructive to remember that the English/Shukovsky imprimatur is by
no means a hallmark of success. Or quality. Remember ``Double
Rush''? ``The Louie Show''? ``My Sister Sam''?
</P>
<P>
   With ``Living in Captivity,'' Shukovsky and English are trying
to be _ in the grand tradition of Wyatt Earp _ brave, courageous
and bold. Thus, in a suburban setting, four white and two African
American characters say and do stupid, bigoted and impolitic things
that are supposed to make us cogitate and cachinnate at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   Making people think while they laugh is the highest form of
comedy. And the hardest. On TV, ``All in the Family'' did it best.
``Murphy Brown'' did it occasionally. ``Living in Captivity'' does
it poorly, at least in the first three episodes.
</P>
<P>
   Blame it on an unconvincing cast filled with the usual
stereotypes (blonde bimbo, Italian American doofus, etc.), and on
scripted situations that are designed to make us recognize our own
biases but that don't ring true.
</P>
<P>
   The ``situations'' in ``I Love Lucy'' never rang true, either,
but Lucy wasn't trying to make us better people. With its loftier
aspirations, ``Living in Captivity'' should be aiming higher than
the gutter.
</P>
<P>
   Living in Captivity. Half-hour comedy about three couples living
in a gated suburban community. Starring Dondre T. Whitfield, Kira
Arne, Matthew Letscher, Melinda McGraw, Mia Cottet and Lenny
Venito. Premieres Friday night on Fox. Parental guideline rating:
TV-PG.

ANALYSIS: RECIPE FOR TROUBLE: FALLING DOMINOES, LEADERSHIP VACUUM 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Washington has been so distracted by President
Clinton's troubles, by the slow-motion collapse of the Russian
government and by the continuing meltdown of Asia that few here
have had time to consider what could set off the next wave of
economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday Washington and Wall Street, two universes rarely
in sync, got a taste of what may be coming.
</P>
<P>
   The images of Kenneth Starr's boxes of evidence landing on
Capitol Hill helped propel the U.S. markets to another big slide
Thursday, and the threat of impeachment proceedings against
President Clinton only adds to the sense that the United States is
no longer a haven against instability.
</P>
<P>
   So it was telling that after a Cabinet meeting late Thursday
afternoon, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin appeared on NBC to
underscore that the president is ``intensely focused'' on world
economic events, even while he fights for political survival and
apologizes for what Rubin termed ``terrible mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin made an oblique argument that keeping the president in his
job was essential, saying this is ``a time when the world has only
one leader who understands these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, the Asian crisis was landing
full-force in the Americas. Brazil's 15.82 percent market drop
Thursday, after days of frantic announcements intended to calm
investors who were fleeing its currency, dissolved the few
remaining hopes that Latin America would somehow stave off the
economic contagion that began in the Pacific. Mexico's currency has
declined to lows not seen since the 1995 peso crisis, reviving the
fears of that first post-Cold War dip into economic meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of economic rationale behind the fear that a
breach of the Latin wall could be far more devastating for U.S.
companies than the twin crises in Asia and Russia. U.S. exports to
Latin America are far greater than to Asia, and U.S. banks are much
more heavily exposed to a downturn there. But perhaps just as
importantly, if economic turmoil engulfs the region, the contagion
will be exploding just over the United States' southern border.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very scary combination of events,'' said John S.
Wadsworth Jr., the chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia. ``The classical
solutions to contain the Asian crisis failed. Meanwhile, we have a
series of political vacuums at a moment when the complexity of the
world's economic and financial situation requires real
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no world central bank, no world equivalent of Alan
Greenspan, at a moment when our main problems around the globe are
financial. That only magnifies the trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   The closest institution that fits that global role is the
International Monetary Fund. Until now, the administration's bet
was that the outbreak of new brush fires around the world would
persuade Congress to put another $18 billion into the cash-strapped
IMF, rather than risk being accursed of partisan wrangling while
world economies melt.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy, though, is clearly failing: On Thursday, the House
Appropriations Committee refused to approve a donation larger than
$3.4 billion, a step some in the administration fear could doom
hopes of replenishing the fund's coffers. Clinton, distracted to
say the least, is in no position to lobby for more funds. The
debate is not yet over _ the Senate approved full financing for the
IMF, and its view could still prevail when the issue goes to a
conference committee of the two houses _ but an aide to Rubin said
Thursday that the funds are ``clearly in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   It is always difficult, of course, to say what is spooking
markets the most: the prospect of long, drawn-out impeachment
hearings, or a recession in Latin America that would hurt corporate
profits even further, or just a general nervousness that a
remarkable period of world prosperity is grinding slowly to a halt.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But it would be a mistake to underestimate the impact of
Clinton's troubles.
</P>
<P>
   The markets never blinked when the 1994 elections created
political gridlock, a Democrat in the White House and Republicans
running Congress. In fact, they celebrated. Economies around the
world were running on all cylinders, and the Wall Street view was
that inaction in Washington could do no harm.
</P>
<P>
   This is a very different time, however, and gridlock is a
different phenomena than a leadership vacuum. At moments of
economic peril, what governments say, how quickly they react to
plunging currencies or market crises, how fast they reassure
investors that things are under control, take on new dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   With the president viewed as crippled, at best, that leadership
role falls almost entirely to Rubin and to Greenspan. If the
markets decide that that their joint efforts to persuade Congress
to fund the IMF are doomed to failure, they may also determine that
the United States is in no position to back up its calming words
with cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worry is that we create a vicious circle,'' one
administration official said Thursday. ``All the impeachment
hysteria has to affect the market. And as the U.S. market drops, it
fuels the drops around the world _ even though they may have other
causes. You get into this vicious circle.''
</P>
<P>
   The comparisons with 1974, when the House Judiciary Committee
was voting out impeachment articles against Nixon, are not very
helpful. Markets then were a lot less global. Moreover, the
fundamentals of the U.S. economy were weak, hurt by inflation and
oil embargoes and huge military spending on the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the markets dropped about 25 percent that summer
and kept falling even after Nixon had resigned.
</P>
<P>
   This time, things are likely to be different. The market has
already dropped, for reasons that have little to do with Clinton's
fortunes. And what happens in Latin America, or Japan, or Russia
will undoubtedly loom far larger in today's markets than events in
those countries would have in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   But as one member of Clinton's economic team put it Thursday:
``This would be a hard enough international crisis to handle in
normal times. And there is nothing normal about what's going on
here now.'' &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Investors in the stock market have to be ready for
ups and downs. Everybody knows that. But who was prepared for the
market's manic depressive mood swings of the past few weeks? And
what do the increasingly violent moves in stocks mean for the
market overall?
</P>
<P>
   Investors who thought that Tuesday's stunning surge was the end
of the market's late-summer troubles quickly learned otherwise when
the Dow Jones industrial average fell 155.76 points Wednesday. The
market continued to cave Thursday with the Dow falling 249.48
points, or 3.17 percent, to close at 7615.54. In the past two day's
trading, investors have given up more than they made during
Tuesday's record point rise.
</P>
<P>
   These are wide swings. But they are not as wide as the gaps in
recent weeks between the high and the low each day in the market
averages. In two out of three trading days this week, the Dow Jones
industrial average traded in a range that exceeded 300 points.
Thursday's range of 338.57 points amounted to 4.3 percent of the
index's value. And the swings in markets overseas have been even
greater.
</P>
<P>
   Moodiness like this used to be an occasional thing in American
stocks. Now, going from euphoria to depression is de rigeur.
Trouble is, these market gyrations have consequences: they are
highly distressing to investors' psyches and exceedingly costly to
their portfolios. Extreme volatility in share prices, what
investors have been experiencing since stocks peaked in July, makes
the market feel like a crapshoot.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, with the Dow Jones industrials around 7600, it does
take a bigger move in points to register a meaningful percentage
gain or loss. Nobody expects the stock market at these levels to
move up or down a mere 25 points or so.
</P>
<P>
   But percentage moves of 4 percent or more that have whipsawed
investors recently makes the market seem more unstable, less rock
solid. And these moves are not limited to the indexes. Consider
what happened Thursday to the stock of Yahoo!, which closed at
$79.875. Its high was $80.50, its low $73. That $7.50 range is 9.3
percent of the stock's high.
</P>
<P>
   Internet stocks are volatile, of course. So here's another
example: Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. Thursday's trading in that stock had a
range of 7.8 percent, from a high of $55.875 to a low of $51.50.
The stock closed the day at $55.50.
</P>
<P>
   These are not isolated examples. Neither was their volatility
the result of a hot news announcement. Many other stocks trade in
exceedingly wide ranges nowadays. The major indexes do as well.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in just the past month, almost one trading day in three
involved an unusually wide trading range, according to Fane Lozman,
the chairman of Scanshift, a creator of market display software in
Chicago. During the 23 trading days going back to August 10, Lozman
studied the intraday range for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 September
futures contracts, the vehicle that institutional investors used to
buy or sell the overall market. He found that on seven occasions
the range for the futures during a day's trading was
one-and-one-half times greater than the mean range had been during
the previous thirty days. On three occasions, the range was twice
as great as it had been previously.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a new market era of volatility that people have to
get used to,'' Lozman said. ``The average person likes to see a
nice steady increase in stock prices. But the speed with which this
market goes from one price level to another price level is
incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also expensive, at least for individual investors.
Professional traders like wide swings in stocks because on the
large blocks of shares that they trade, they can make big money on
even the tiniest move. But for smaller investors, volatility makes
getting in and out of stocks a very costly proposition. Think of
the person who sold Citicorp Thursday at its low of $83.50, only to
see it close at $88.25. Or the investor who bought Exxon at
$70.6875, only to see it close one point lower.
</P>
<P>
   What's to explain the market's bungee jumps? One broker, a
veteran of 36 years who has seen all kinds of markets, believes
that extreme volatility signals a true bear market. ``It shows a
lack of confidence on the part of professionals, a danger of being
long stocks overnight,'' this broker said. Because his firm does
not allow its employees to speak on the record to reporters, he
insisted on anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Volatility rises during down moves in stocks because shares tend
to fall faster than they rise, as evidenced by the fact that bear
markets typically end much more quickly than bull markets do. When
intense selling starts, specialists and market makers drop their
bid prices quickly, looking for the levels where value investors
will start to come in. As a result, wild swings in stocks signal a
pitched battle between the short-term investors who are bearish and
the longer-term players who are bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Brokers are mixed on what investors should do to protect
themselves from the high costs of trading in volatile markets. Some
advise investors looking to get into stocks to use only limit
orders, which specify a price the investor is willing to pay for
the shares. Market orders, in which an investor pays the prevailing
market price on his order, are more common and often cheaper to
execute. But in times of volatility market orders can be a good way
to pay up to buy stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Other brokers advise investors to simply sit out the rough and
tumble trading days. These people say that on those occasions, the
market is simply trying to find a level, that all the churning in
stocks makes it impossible to buy with confidence. One adviser said
that in the past six weeks, he has wound up paying on average 5
percent more than he wanted on market orders. When markets were
calmer, he would have no trouble getting stock at the price he had
seen on his screen when he put in the order.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what investors do to combat the effects of
volatility in stocks, they should brace themselves for more yo-yo
moves. The swings are unsettling and nobody is sure whether it
means the market is nearer a bottom or just starting a decline.
Here's a tiny bit of consolation for individuals: volatility like
this even scares the professionals.

NATIONAL SEMICONDUCTOR'S LOSS IS SMALLER THAN EXPECTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ After warning investors in recent weeks that
earnings would be hurt by economic turmoil in Asia and other
markets, two giants of the semiconductor industry offered slightly
more upbeat announcements Thursday suggesting an improved outlook.
</P>
<P>
   National Semiconductor, which predicted last month that its
fiscal first-quarter results would be weak, Thursday reported a
loss that fell slightly below analysts' estimates. In a conference
call with analysts, National executives said orders had begun to
pick up in August, and if the current order rate persisted they
believed second-quarter results would be stronger.
</P>
<P>
   But on a more ominous note, they also said that the company's
production lines were currently running at less than half their
capacity, and that it was still too early to declare a recovery.
Orders were down almost 30 percent compared with last year.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Intel Corp. predicted that its third-quarter sales
would be 8 to 10 percent higher than the $5.9 billion reported in
the second quarter, an improvement that the company attributed to
stronger-than-expected demand in North America and Europe. The
company had previously forecast flat revenues. Intel said Thursday
that profit margins would improve about 2 points from the 49
percent it reported in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   National shares closed Thursday at $8.94, down 31 cents, on the
New York Stock Exchange. Analysts said National was still suffering
from a combination of the global slump brought on by the Asian
economic crisis, and a loss of market share in key segments because
of a failure to introduce new products in a timely way. Intel
closed at $79.625, down $2.1875.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended Aug. 30, National reported a loss of
$104.8 million, compared with earnings of $62.6 million, or 38
cents a share fully diluted, a year ago. Sales dropped 28.5
percent, to $469.6 million, from $656.7 million in the first
quarter of the 1998 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   On a per share basis, National lost 63 cents in the quarter.
Analysts had expected it to lose 65 cents a share, according to
First Call.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Sales continued soft during the summer quarter,'' said Brian
Halla, National's chairman, president and chief executive, in a
statement. ``We think, however, we may have touched bottom as
bookings in the first quarter improved for the first time in a
year. With 41 percent of our capacity being utilized, we're
obviously ready for the upturn.''
</P>
<P>
   Drew Peck, an analyst with S.G. Cowen, said that while the
improvement in orders in August was a positive development, so many
of those orders were for short-term deliveries that it was
difficult to draw any meaningful conclusions. ``Visibility is
horrendous and pricing is under enormous pressure,'' he said. ``The
likelihood of them becoming profitable in the next several quarters
is pretty low.''
</P>
<P>
   National has pegged its hopes for growth and profitability on a
so-called PC-on-a-chip, which would combine all the circuitry of a
personal computer on a single semiconductor, making possible many
kinds of low-cost computing and communications products. Halla said
that this chip remained on track for a June 1999 introduction and
that the company had met other internal goals for new product
introductions. It also shifted production of its Cyrix
microprocessors to its own factories rather than subcontracting
production to IBM.
</P>
<P>
   Although National warned last month that its second quarter
would be flat relative to the first quarter, the improvement in
orders in August suggests that revenues could instead be up about 5
percent sequentially, Donald Macleod, National's chief financial
officer, said in the conference call. If that is the case, ``we
should be able to reduce our loss per share in the second quarter
by 10 to 15 cents,'' he said.

STARR REPORT: PLENTY ON LEWINSKY, LITTLE ON WHITEWATER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The report sent to Congress by the Whitewater
independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, contends that evidence shows
that President Clinton committed perjury, obstructed justice,
tampered with witnesses and abused the power of his office, lawyers
familiar with the report said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's 445-page report asserts that Clinton lied during his
civil deposition in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit in
January and during his grand jury testimony last month from the
White House, three lawyers who insisted on anonymity said.
</P>
<P>
   In a 140-page section that outlines possible grounds for
impeachment, prosecutors accuse Clinton of abuse of power, one of
the impeachment counts leveled against Richard Nixon in 1974. They
level an allegation that the president used government resources to
attempt to thwart Starr's inquiry for seven months, the lawyers
said.
</P>
<P>
   They wrote that the president allowed government lawyers and
senior aides to deny repeatedly to the public that Clinton had an
inappropriate or improper relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, the
25-year-old former White House intern. And, the lawyers said,
prosecutors are also critical of the privilege claims filed by
government lawyers to attempt to block the grand jury testimony of
White House aides and lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The report to Congress finds no impeachable offenses in the bulk
of Starr's four-year-old inquiry on such matters as the Whitewater
land deal or the alleged misuse of FBI files and potential coverup
in the White House travel office. Lawyers say, however, that the
report draws parallels between the White House conduct in the
Lewinsky inquiry and efforts, they say, that were made in the
Whitewater inquiry to cover up what actually happened.
</P>
<P>
   The long-awaited report, which the House of Representatives
plans to post on the Internet on Friday, is ``a damaging narrative
that reads like a novel,'' one lawyer familiar with its contents
said Thursday. ``It accuses the president of lying and obstructing,
over and over.''
</P>
<P>
   But during a meeting with Senate Democrats at the White House,
Clinton assured them they would find ``no surprises'' in Starr's
report.
</P>
<P>
   David Kendall, the president's lawyer, said Thursday that the
report is nothing more than a collection of prosecutors'
``contentions, claims and allegations and we look forward to the
chance to rebut them.''
</P>
<P>
   A copy of the report was not made available to The New York
Times, but the shape of the report was described in interviews on
Thursday with three lawyers who said they were familiar with its
contents.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers said the Starr report also pieces together evidence
that they say could indicate that the president had obstructed
justice, another article in the Watergate case.
</P>
<P>
   The twin pillars of that portion of the report are allegations
that Clinton played a role in an attempt by his friend, Vernon
Jordan, to find Ms. Lewinsky a job in the private sector last
December, the lawyers said. The report also lays out a case that
the president played an active role Ms. Lewinsky's decision to
return several presidential gifts, which had been sought by a
subpoena from the Jones lawyers, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Both actions were intended to keep Ms. Lewinsky from telling the
truth to the Jones lawyers about her sexual relationship with the
president, the prosecutors contend.
</P>
<P>
   In his grand jury testimony, Clinton denied that he had sought
to help Ms. Lewinsky secure a job or retrieve the gifts, his allies
have said.
</P>
<P>
   The report also details the fact that Clinton summoned his
secretary, Betty Currie, to the White House on Sunday, Jan. 18, the
day after Clinton was asked a series of questions about Ms.
Lewinsky, including private visits she had with Clinton, a lawyer
said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In February, a White House official dismissed the Currie meeting
as an effort by the president to ``refresh his recollection'' about
Ms. Lewinsky's visits and other matters. The report said that
Clinton had other motives for summoning Mrs. Currie on that Sunday
in January. It said that he asked her a series of questions in an
attempt to influence her as a potential witness in the Jones case,
the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors contend that Clinton also tried to interfere with
the Paula Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit against him as early as
the summer of 1997, the lawyers said. In May 1997, the Supreme
Court ruled, unanimously, that the Jones lawsuit would proceed
while Clinton was still in office. Within a week, Mrs. Jones'
lawyers had said they would attempt to interview under oath other
women linked to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   That summer, the report says, Clinton asked Ms. Lewinsky to keep
their relationship a secret. That request came six months before
the former White House intern was subpoenaed to testify in the
case, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers said he also encouraged Ms. Lewinsky to urge her friend
and another potential witness, Linda Tripp, to stay silent about a
White House volunteer named Kathleen Willey. Ms. Willey said she
resisted an unwanted sexual advance from the president just outside
the Oval Office. At the time, a Newsweek reporter was attempting to
interview Mrs. Tripp, who bumped into Ms. Willey shortly after the
alleged encounter.
</P>
<P>
   In the 140-page section that lays out the grounds for possible
impeachment proceedings, there are several ``salacious and
detailed'' references to sexual encounters between Clinton and Ms.
Lewinsky inside the president's private study near the Oval Office,
the lawyers said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer who is familiar with Starr's strategy said that
prosecutors felt they had to include such material in the section
of the report that discusses whether Clinton had lied to the grand
jury. Clinton denied in his grand jury testimony that he lied about
their relationship in his Jones deposition.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 17, Clinton testified to the grand jury that he had
``inappropriate intimate physical contact'' with Ms. Lewinsky. But
he insisted that the contacts did not meet the definition of
``sexual relations'' established in the Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in his address to the nation that evening, Clinton said
his answers in the Jones deposition about Ms. Lewinsky were
``legally accurate,'' though he acknowledged they were misleading.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say in the report, however, that Clinton lied before
the grand jury when he said that his sexual encounters with Ms.
Lewinsky did not constitute ``sexual relations,'' as defined in the
Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors argue that the president's decision not to answer
those questions compelled them to have Ms. Lewinsky return to the
grand jury and answer more detailed questions about the precise
nature of her sexual encounters with Clinton, the lawyers said.
Many of those graphic details are included in the report, including
a discussion of the now-infamous blue dress that Ms. Lewinsky
turned over to prosecutors, according to lawyers familiar with the
reports' contents.
</P>
<P>
   ``As uncomfortable as this topic may be, there was an obligation
to present it,'' one Starr ally said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A three-part definition of ``sexual relations'' was prepared by
Ms. Jones' lawyers before Clinton's Jan. 17 deposition. But in
responding to an objection of Clinton's lawyer, Judge Susan Webber
Wright of Federal District Court in Little Rock, Ark. limited the
definition from three parts to just Part I:
</P>
<P>
   ``For the purposes of this deposition, a person engages in
`sexual relations' when the person knowingly engages in or causes
contact with the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or
buttocks of any person with an intent to arouse or gratify the
sexual desire of any person.''
</P>
<P>
   But when he was asked in the deposition about Ms. Lewinsky,
Clinton consulted the same definition before he denied that he had
had sexual relations with the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the testimony of Ms. Lewinsky about what happened
during those encounters, prosecutors believe that denial was a lie
under oath, the lawyers said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the prosecutors contend there is evidence that the
president lied several times in the Jones deposition on Jan. 17.
They specifically highlight the president's denial that he had been
alone with Ms. Lewinsky, except on one or two occasions when she
handed him documents in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   While working around the clock over the Labor Day weekend and
intensely for the past several weeks, prosecutors in Starr's office
had always intended to file the report ``as quickly as possible,''
one lawyer said. There was originally a plan to send a referral
letter to Speaker Newt Gingrich and minority leader Richard
Gephardt on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But some lawyers in the office were concerned that Kendall would
possibly file a motion trying to limit the report's contents, or
demanding its early release, with U.S. District Judge Norma
Holloway Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, some staff members of the House Judiciary
Committee had sent signals, through suggestions to news reporters,
that they hoped Starr would write and submit an executive summary,
which could easily be made public. And, lawyers said Thursday,
prosecutors did in fact draw up a draft of an executive summary,
but Starr himself concluded that it was too argumentative and
scrapped the working draft of the executive summary.

TREASURY YIELDS PLUMMET ON EXPECTATIONS OF RATE CUT

 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The prices of Treasury securities leaped Thursday,
sending the yields on 10-year notes and 30-year bonds down to
levels not seen since 1967. The decline shows that investors are
betting that the Federal Reserve will cut short-term interest
rates, a move that could help stabilize stock markets here and
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In a replay of the almost daily flight to the relative safety of
the bond market, investors snapped up Treasury bonds and notes
Thursday. The price of the of 30-year bond jumped 1 1/32, to 104
21/32, while the bond's yield, which moves in the opposite
direction from the price, dropped to 5.19 percent, from 5.26
percent on Wednesday. The yield has dropped almost half a
percentage point since the end of July.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the 10-year note, which is a benchmark for home
mortgage rates, fell to 4.77 percent, from 4.92 percent on
Wednesday. Its yield has fallen almost three-quarters of a
percentage point since the end of July.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management,
said, ``The U.S. government bond market has become the beneficiary
of virtually every market-related news event on the planet.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that these yields and the yields on short-term
maturities are well below the Fed's 5.5 percent target for
short-term interest rates shows investors are betting on the Fed to
lower its target. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, made this bet
even more attractive when he indicated last week that the central
bank would consider a rate cut if the foreign drag on the U.S.
economy worsened.
</P>
<P>
   But the trade-off for such an easing is more inflationary
pressure in the United States. And this is a factor, analysts said,
the Fed officials will have to balance against the turmoil in the
world's financial markets when deciding what action to take.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, a stronger American dollar, falling commodity
prices and a sharp decline in the prices of imported goods have
helped push key inflation indexes lower. These benefits have helped
cushion the negative effect, mostly on American exports, from the
Asian financial crisis that began in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But a cut in interest rates by the Fed could lead to a weaker
dollar, lifting the prices of imports.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a falling dollar would probably help push commodity
prices higher by stimulating demand. Most commodities are priced in
dollars, which means a falling dollar makes commodities cheaper for
many countries, especially those in the developing world. It was
such a decline in the last year that made commodity prices fall so
sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the Commodity Research Bureau/Bridge index of 17
commodities rose 1.06, to 202.59, and it is up nearly 4 percent in
the last two weeks. This recent surge has come as the dollar has
surprisingly slumped against the German mark and the Japanese yen.
The dollar declined to 1.6843 marks Thursday from 1.7215 marks on
Wednesday after earlier touching a 16-month low. The dollar has
also fallen recently against the Canadian dollar, which was at
record lows just two weeks ago. The weakness of the dollar,
analysts say, is in anticipation of a cut by the Fed.
</P>
<P>
   ``An easing by the Fed would be unabashedly positive for the
developing world,'' argued Robert Barbera, chief economist at
Hoenig &AMP; Co. ``But an easing is ambiguous for the United States.
You are reversing the Asia's-pain-is-the-U.S.'s-gain trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert DiClemente, the chief U.S. economist at Salomon Smith
Barney, agrees with such an outlook. But he argued that the
increased inflation that might result would be positive.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative, he said, could be a worldwide recession set off
by the spread of the economic crisis to Latin America. Such a
recession would probably lead to a more dangerous decline in prices
known as deflation. ``The point of easing is that you are heading
off a significant weakening in worldwide demand that would lead to
a decline in prices,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The sharp drop in interest rates has helped offset the economic
drag from the financial turmoil in Asia, Russia and Latin America.
Thirty-year mortgage rates are below 7 percent and should go lower.
</P>
<P>
   But the benefit of lower interest rates is not being spread to
all consumers or companies, which means there is much more of a
drag on American growth than the drop in Treasury yields indicates.
Consumers still face much higher interest rates on credit cards and
other types of borrowing. In addition, the decline in the borrowing
rates for corporations has not fallen as sharply as Treasury
yields. And the cost of borrowing for less creditworthy companies
is rising.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor Co. announced Thursday that it would not proceed
immediately with a new bond issue, in part because yields on
corporate bonds have become less attractive.

SENATE REJECTS OVERHAUL OF FUND-RAISING 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate effectively killed Thursday an overhaul
of campaign finance for this year, as quickly as it had revived it.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an overwhelming vote in the House last month to revamp
the way the country finances political campaigns, supporters in the
Senate failed to muster enough votes Thursday to end a Republican
filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   Senators voted 52-48 to cut off debate and vote on the
legislation, but it takes 60 votes to stop a filibuster, and
Thursday's outcome was never really in doubt. The vote tally was
the same in February, when the Senate last considered the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a stalemate, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who is a major
architect of the bill, withdrew the measure, and the Senate moved
on to legislation to change bankruptcy procedures.
</P>
<P>
   McCain vowed he would offer the legislation ``again, again and
again,'' but not this year unless two or more Senate opponents
changed their minds in the next four weeks before Congress is
scheduled to adjourn for the year.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said there was little pressure on the bill's foes to
reverse course, especially as official Washington was being drawn
deeper into possible impeachment proceedings against President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's diverted,'' a visibly dejected Senator McCain said
after the vote. ``All the oxygen has been sucked out of the room by
this firestorm.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., who is the bill's other main
author, also noted the distractions as he tried in vain to rally
support on the Senate floor ``The report is on the other side of
the Capitol,'' he said. ``We still have a job to do. We must
address the scandal that occupied our attention in 1997.''
</P>
<P>
   Feingold said he and Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., would continue to
attach the legislation to must-pass spending bills the Senate will
consider in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain-Feingold bill would ban the unlimited, unregulated
donations to political parties, called soft money, that allowed the
campaign-financing abuses in the 1996 elections. Those abuses
prompted investigations by the House and Senate last year into
fund-raising practices.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would also curb the increasingly popular
practice by independent groups of running advertisements praising
or attacking candidates. The bill would tightly regulate the issue
ads that identify candidates within 60 days of an election.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the bill had hoped that the House's surprisingly
strong vote of 252 to 179 last month supporting similar legislation
would rekindle momentum for the Senate measure. One of the main
architects of the House bill, Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn.,
walked onto the Senate floor during Thursday's vote, as if to bring
good luck.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, bowed to
McCain's request to renew debate on the issue this week, rather
than divide Republicans and shift attention away from Clinton's
woes.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's backers had also hoped to capitalize on Attorney
General Janet Reno's recent decisions to order three new 90-day
inquiries that could lead to the appointment of independent
counsels to investigate whether Clinton and Vice President Al Gore
violated campaign finance laws in the 1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
   But the House has approved campaign finance overhaul before in
recent years, only to see the Senate pour cold water on the
proposals. That seems to be the case again.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's critics said Thursday's opposition to the bill was
rock-solid, and predicted it would remain so. ``It's safe to say
this bill isn't going to pass,'' Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who
is the bill's chief foe, said after the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Even though they faced long odds, supporters of the Senate bill
said it was important to follow the House vote. ``Some may ask,
`Why keep bringing this up?''' said Feingold. ``The reason is, it
is a crucial issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent an entire year investigating the 1996 election,'' he
said. ``We owe it to the American people to finish the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters said the bill was essential to prevent the corrupting
influence big donors have on the political process and to help
restore trust in elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have the worst campaign-finance system we've ever had
in this country,'' said Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., who headed the
Senate's inquiry last year into campaign abuses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to McCain and Thompson, the other Republicans
joining all 45 Democrats in favor of cutting off debate were Susan
Collins and Olympia Snowe of Maine, James Jeffords of Vermont,
Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and John Chafee of Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said the bill would strip citizens of their First
Amendment right to free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of so-called reforming the law stands in the eye of
the beholder,'' said Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska. ``To what
extent, if any, should the federal government regulate political
speech in America?''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, said the measure's proponents were
arguing the wrong issue: ``We shouldn't be talking about changing
laws, but enforcing the ones we already have. Most of us play by
the rules, and the rules are tough.''

<P>
   MOSCOW _ The gleaming marble and glass headquarters of MFK
Renaissance, one of Russia's leading investment banks, stands as
tangible evidence of the financial gold rush that briefly swept
through here. Limousines still park by the firm's front doors,
which abut the offices of Moscow's pre-eminent power broker, Mayor
Yuri Luzhkov _ quite a change from just three years ago, when MFK
Renaissance operated from the spare confines of a former hotel
disco.
</P>
<P>
   But inside MFK Renaissance, beyond plush royal blue carpeting
and elegantly upholstered furniture, the trading floor and its
computers are eerily quiet. And for good reason. Most of the bank's
capital has been wiped out, most of its assets are nearly
worthless, and the firm, like many other investment banks that not
so long ago were speculating in Moscow's booming markets, is
scrambling to stay afloat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a football game here; every player has taken a
hit,'' said Boris Jordan, 32, MFK Renaissance's avuncular _ and
still-optimistic _ founder. ``The real issue is who's executing
their responsibilities and moving the ball forward. From that
perspective, MFK Renaissance is in fine shape and remains a market
leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its future, MFK Renaissance's meteoric rise and sudden
implosion is more than just a tale of how quickly this boom town
has become a financial ghost town. It is also a parable of
international finance in the 1990s that reveals how those who
exploited the advantages of free markets and the unfettered flow of
capital around the world are being swept up in the whirlwind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the lesson people will take from this is that the
domino theory does work and there can be massive financial
contagion,'' said Tom Ashead, co-head of research at Brunswick
Warburg, a Moscow brokerage firm. ``But the contagion only revealed
weaknesses that were already apparent in Russia, and they were
weaknesses many investors chose not to see.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Jordan was uniquely positioned to play a role near
the center of Russia's awful economic management. While still only
in his 20s, Jordan, a grandson of Soviet-era refugees who emigrated
to America, was already a key adviser to the Russian government.
These services were combined with investment banking pursuits that
placed Jordan at the heart of financial schemes that only postponed
the day of reckoning for the Russian economy _ and may have made it
even worse.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, a native of Long Island, was part of a large contingent
of Russian-Americans who arrived in Moscow in the late '80s and
early '90s. Some were motivated by an interest in rebuilding the
country their ancestors fled. Others simply had dollar signs in
their eyes. In either case, it proved easy to set up shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``People thought that if you had a Russian accent and some
education you could be an investment banker or a stockbroker or
anything else you wanted to be,'' said Andrei Bogolubov, the
Russian-American president of AB Image, a public relations firm in
Moscow and a consultant to MFK Renaissance. ``That seems like a
long time ago now.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan had worked at the American investment banking firm
Kidder, Peabody &AMP; Co., which no longer exists, and an Irish
aircraft leasing company, before taking a job here with Credit
Suisse First Boston in 1992. He then managed to win Credit Suisse a
position as an adviser to Moscow as the Russian government began a
huge privatization of state-owned companies. That campaign ended up
turning them over mostly to insiders _ some of whom are suspected
of milking the assets for their own purposes _ and to politically
connected robber barons.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan left Credit Suisse to start what became MFK Renaissance
in 1995, the same year that the second phase of privatization
began. At the heart of this new phase was a controversial program
begun in 1995 and known as loans-for-shares. The program allowed a
handful of banks led by a powerful clique of Russian businessmen
dubbed the ``oligarchs'' to lend the government money in return for
receiving controlling stakes in many of Russia's most significant
industrial concerns.
</P>
<P>
   It was a process fraught with accusations of sweetheart deals
and influence peddling, and Jordan was at the center of the action.
His firm, Renaissance Capital, developed a close alliance with
Vladimir Potanin, a former government official and an oligarch who
was the head of Uneximbank, a Russian bank that gained control of
several large nickel and oil companies. Uneximbank is an investor
in the entity they put together, MFK Renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's ascent, his financial holdings, and his contacts within
the Russian government led officials from the United States to call
on him when they were in town. He attracted the hot money of hedge
fund gurus like George Soros and Michael Dingman. Soros has an
undisclosed sum invested with MFK Renaissance while Dingman, who
sits on the board of Sidanko, a Russian oil concern controlled by
Messrs. Jordan and Potanin, also holds an equity stake in the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Dingman has been criticized for financial wheeling and dealing
in the Czech Republic that ended up ruining many individual
investors there, but Dingman said that criticism was ``unfair'' and
does not apply to his investment activities here. ``It's an example
of what I didn't do and am not doing in Russia,'' Dingman said.
``My commitment to Russia is deliberately long term.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, as Jordan and his firm grew richer, the Russian
securities market was percolating. New Russian government
short-term securities that paid whopping interest rates, GKO's,
attracted a whole new crew of investors to Russia in 1996 and 1997.
Suddenly, Moscow seemed to be one of the world's most promising
financial centers and MFK Renaissance was one of the most active
participants in the GKO market. ``It was like you could hear the
sound of money being made in the streets,'' said an executive with
an American investment bank here who requested anonymity. ``It
sorted of wafted up into your apartment or hotel window.''
</P>
<P>
   But for some not caught up in the thrill of the money mill's
churning, it sounded more like a casino gone wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a classic sort of bubble and there was a lot of
betting,'' said Al Breach, an economist with the Russian-European
Center for Economic Policy. ``People bought because the market was
going up, not because the fundamentals were sound. Lots of
investors, serious investors, didn't even know there were big
government deficits here. It became ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the GKO's paid such lofty interest rates _ 30 percent
to 50 percent annually and as high as 150 percent earlier this
spring _ because the Russian government's deficit was ballooning.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   A key factor in Russia's collapse was a failure to collect
taxes, which were supposed to replace the revenues previously
generated by state-owned enterprises. And with oil prices
collapsing, Russia could no longer count on enough money from what
had been its most valuable resource. Without enough revenues to pay
its bills, and to support ailing local banks that owned the bonds,
Russia issued more GKO's with ever-higher interest rates attractive
to foreign and domestic investors _ a short-term fix that
eventually buried the government under a pyramid of debt that
collapsed last month.
</P>
<P>
   That in turn touched off a devaluation of the Russian ruble,
contributing to international fears about the soundness of other
emerging markets as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, I think the GKO market didn't bring any real
investment to the Russian economy,'' said Dmitri Vasiliev, chairman
of Russia's Federal Commission for the Securities Market. ``It just
covered very high government deficits.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone close to the Russian government, or even remotely
familiar with its finances, should have seen that investing in
GKO's in the absence of a sound tax policy was nothing but a
speculative game.
</P>
<P>
   But Jordan said he came to Moscow to help rejuvenate the economy
and did not see his crucial participation in the GKO market as
detrimental to Russia. He said that as an investor he had to be
rewarded for the risk he took in buying the bonds and that they
were ``constructive'' until the government ``mangled'' them to plug
fiscal gaps.
</P>
<P>
   He is also smarting from the malaise created by the GKO debacle.
An individual close to the firm and familiar with MFK Renaissance's
finances said that the firm's capital, about $200 million at the
end of last year, has nearly been wiped out. He said the firm had
about $2 billion in assets at the end of last year that are worth
about $200 million now _ and many of those assets will be entirely
written off. Needless to say, the investment bank is expected to
post a loss this year.
</P>
<P>
   MFK Renaissance also owes about $100 million on hedging
contracts. It is owed $200 to $300 million by local banks, but it
has little chance of collecting the money since most Russian banks
are now insolvent.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, who has spent lavishly renovating a home in the
exclusive Zhukovka district outside Moscow, said he had no holdings
abroad other than ``cash'' and was committed to staying in Russia
unless his family was threatened by the downturn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pioneered this market and didn't jump on planes when the
tanks rolled in 1993 or when the market collapsed in 1995,'' he
said. ``We intend to remain at the forefront through this cycle,
too.''

<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ Hampered by bad weather and other
problems, investigators reported only slow progress Thursday as
they began their second week of work on the crash of Swissair
Flight 111.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the moment it is a very, very challenging enterprise,''
said Vic Gerden, the chief investigator for Canada's Transportation
Safety Board, in a briefing this evening. Divers entered the water
just before 7 p.m. local time for the first time since Monday,
beginning an unusual, and more hazardous, nighttime dive.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, an MD-11, crashed off the coast here on the evening
of Sept. 2, killing all 229 people aboard, about an hour after
takeoff from Kennedy International Airport. Before the crash, the
pilots reported that the cockpit was filling with smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Gerden disposed Thursday of one early theory, that the plane had
hit a buoy, and said that metallurgists had determined conclusively
that the steel had broken long before the crash into the sea. He
cautioned that it was too soon to concentrate on any particular
avenue of investigation.
</P>
<P>
   One of the avenues being explored, however, involves an
electrical part called a DC tie bus, situated on a rack under the
cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   The tie bus had failed on another Swissair plane, prompting the
airline to replace the part on all of its planes of that model.
</P>
<P>
   On the plane that crashed here, however, the new part was
installed incorrectly, touching off a minor fire some weeks before
the crash, investigators said. The fire caused little damage, and
the installation was corrected. But investigators now want more
details about the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The DC tie bus is part of the plane's 28-volt direct-current
system. Should one of the plane's three electrical generators fail,
the tie bus allows the plane's three DC systems to draw power from
the remaining generators.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators would like to examine the tie bus, and are also
eager to get their hands on the cockpit voice recorder, which has
made its approximate location known by a ``pinger'' but has not yet
been spotted by divers. They would also like several computerized
cockpit instruments, which they believe have data on the last few
minutes of flight stored in their microchips. And they would like
to recover the whole front end of the plane, to look for fire
damage.
</P>
<P>
   Two investigators also said that before the first trouble call
to air traffic control, the crew appeared to be running through a
checklist for pneumatic problems. They do not know why.
</P>
<P>
   Progress on the investigation has been slow. Divers were kept
out of the water Tuesday by rough weather, and Wednesday by delays
in setting up diving equipment. Thus all the material retrieved so
far, with the exception of the flight data recorder, has been found
floating or washed up on the shorelines of the ragged coast and
islands here.
</P>
<P>
   No human remains have reached the mortuary since Monday, said
the Nova Scotia Medical Examiner, Dr. John Butt. He said that as of
Thursday two more victims had been identified, bringing the total
of victims identified to four.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Butt said he was beginning to discuss with families what
they would like done if he returned to them partial remains of
their relatives. ``One can understand there are people who wish to
bring closure to this,'' he said, anticipating that some families
would hold funerals and then say they did not want to be notified
if additional material was identified. Other families, he said,
would probably ask to have all the remains returned, even if it was
in separate shipments, for religious or other reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Butt said he was discussing with Jewish and Muslim families
the rules of their faiths for establishing identity of the remains.
Many of the remains recovered are too small for a family member to
positively identify them, he said.

WHITEWATER APPEARS TO BE A DEAD ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The report to Congress from the independent
counsel, whose inquiry began four years ago with an examination of
a complicated land deal called Whitewater and extended to
investigations involving the White House travel office and the
administration's use of FBI files, finds no offense by President
Clinton in any of those areas that would merit impeachment, lawyers
with knowledge of the report's content said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The report, the lawyers said, does draw parallels between the
president's conduct in the investigation of his relationship with
Monica Lewinsky and the Arkansas aspects of the inquiry. Indeed, it
was the argument of the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, that
there were parallels, that gained him jurisdiction eight months ago
to investigate a possible cover-up of Clinton's relationship with
the White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   But the report's section on impeachment charges _ obstruction of
justice, perjury, witness tampering and abuse of power _ is
grounded solely in Clinton's relationship to Ms. Lewinsky and his
response to questions about it raised in a civil lawsuit, the
lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair to conclude that those other areas do not rise to
the threshhold of an impeachable offense,'' said John Bates, a
former deputy independent counsel in the Whitewater inquiry. ``It
wouldn't make sense for the independent counsel to send two reports
to Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Allies of the independent counsel said Thursday that the fact
that the report will be largely silent on the first three years of
the inquiry, before the Lewinsky matter, meant only that the
prosecutors had discovered no impeachable offenses in the many
areas long under investigation by both Starr and his predecessor as
the Whitewater independent counsel, Robert Fiske.
</P>
<P>
   While Starr is required to submit a final report on all aspects
of his inquiry to a special court and he could still be critical of
the White House for its handling of those matters, the filing of
the impeachment report signals that after years of examination,
those avenues of inquiry may soon close.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have spent four years examining whether the
efforts by the President and Mrs. Clinton to suppress embarrassing
details of their old financial dealings with the owners of a
corrupt savings and loan association _ in particular, their
investment in the Whitewater real-estate development _ amounted to
a criminal cover-up or simply reflected an acceptable exercise in
political damage control.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, a federal grand jury in Arkansas completed a 30-month
review of the matter by filing a single indictment, a criminal
contempt case against Susan McDougal, one of the Clintons' business
partners in the Whitewater land venture and an operator of the
bank, the Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan of Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   The Arkansas phase of the investigation resulted in several
criminal convictions, including those of Mrs. McDougal and her
husband, James; Jim Guy Tucker, the governor who succeeded CLinton,
and David Hale, a former local judge, on fraud and other charges.
</P>
<P>
   The convictions were a mixed blessing. They forced some
recalcitrant defendants to cooperate and provide new information
about the Clintons. But they also made it difficult for prosecutors
to build a case against the president and first lady based largely
on the testimony of felons.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has faced other hurdles. Mrs. McDougal refused to answer
questions. McDougal died in jail. Hale has come under a new inquiry
for his finances. Tucker's cooperation was described by other
witnesses as only moderately helpful.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his supporters have long criticized Starr and his
team of investigators from straying too far from his original
jurisdiction. The fact that the impeachment report will rely almost
exclusively on the Lewinsky inquiry and ignore whole areas of the
long-running investigation into other matters is almost certain to
be seized upon by some Clinton supporters as evidence that the
independent counsel had no real case to make other than one
involving purely private matters that would not ordinarily be
prosecuted. But supporters of Starr pointed to the focused nature
of the report as a strong sign that Starr had conducted a fair
investigation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The inquiry was begun in January 1994 by Fiske, the original
Whitewater prosecutor. He was appointed at a time when the
independent counsel law had lapsed, however, and in August a court
panel refused to reappoint him, naming Starr, a former solicitor
general under President Bush, in his place.
</P>
<P>
   Starr began his inquiry on Aug. 5, 1994, when the court
instructed him to investigate whether crimes were committed
``relating in any way to James B. McDougal's, President William
Jefferson Clinton's or Mrs. Hillary Rodham Clinton's relationship
with Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association, Whitewater
Development Corp., or Capital Management Services,'' the company
controlled by Hale.
</P>
<P>
   Hale had said that Clinton asked him to make an improper
federally backed loan, some of which wound up in a Whitewater
account. Under oath, the president has denied Hale's accusation.
</P>
<P>
   While the court order appeared to focus on a rather discreet
area, it also included a clause that granted Starr broad latitude.
It said Starr also had jurisdiction to investigate serious crimes
that may have been committed ``by any person or entity developed
during the independent counsel's investigation referred to above
and connected with or arising out of that investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before Starr's appointment, Fiske had already expanded the
inquiry, deciding to investigate Webster Hubbell, a close friend of
the president's and a former Arkansas law partner of Mrs.
Clinton's, on suspicion of stealing money from his former law firm
and clients at the Rose Law Firm. Hubbell ultimately pleaded guilty
to two felony counts of fraud and tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, in seeking jurisdiction to investigate the
president's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, Starr argued that
efforts by Clinton's friend Vernon Jordan to find the former intern
a job paralleled earlier efforts by the president's allies,
including Jordan, to help Hubbell in exchange for silence.
</P>
<P>
   And after Starr took over, Reno repeatedly expanded Starr's
mandate. In 1996, Reno agreed to expand the inquiry to include an
examination of whether two Arkansas bankers improperly funneled
money into one of Clinton's gubernatorial campaigns. After the two
bankers were ultimately acquitted on some of the charges,
prosecutors agreed to drop the case.
</P>
<P>
   Reno also ordered an expansion of the inquiry to include a look
at the circumstances surrounding the dismissal of the White House
travel office and the role Mrs. Clinton played in the affair. In
the summer of 1996, she asked the special court overseeing the
independent counsel to expand his authority to examine whether any
laws were broken by the White House possession of hundreds of FBI
personnel files on prominent and obscure Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Those inquiries have yielded no indictments. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The report sent to Congress by the Whitewater
independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, contends that evidence shows
that President Clinton committed perjury, obstructed justice,
tampered with witnesses and abused the power of his office, lawyers
familiar with the report said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's 445-page report asserts that Clinton lied during his
civil deposition in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit in
January and during his grand jury testimony last month from the
White House, three lawyers who insisted on anonymity said.
</P>
<P>
   In a 140-page section that outlines possible grounds for
impeachment, prosecutors accuse Clinton of abuse of power, one of
the impeachment counts leveled against Richard Nixon in 1974. They
level an allegation that the president used government resources to
attempt to thwart Starr's inquiry for seven months, the lawyers
said.
</P>
<P>
   They wrote that the president allowed government lawyers and
senior aides to deny repeatedly to the public that Clinton had an
inappropriate or improper relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, the
25-year-old former White House intern. And, the lawyers said,
prosecutors are also critical of the privilege claims filed by
government lawyers to attempt to block the grand jury testimony of
White House aides and lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The report to Congress finds no impeachable offenses in the bulk
of Starr's four-year-old inquiry on such matters as the Whitewater
land deal or the alleged misuse of FBI files and potential coverup
in the White House travel office. Lawyers say, however, that the
report draws parallels between the White House conduct in the
Lewinsky inquiry and efforts, they say, that were made in the
Whitewater inquiry to cover up what actually happened.
</P>
<P>
   The long-awaited report, which the House of Representatives
plans to post on the Internet on Friday, is ``a damaging narrative
that reads like a novel,'' one lawyer familiar with its contents
said Thursday. ``It accuses the president of lying and obstructing,
over and over.''
</P>
<P>
   But during a meeting with Senate Democrats at the White House,
Clinton assured them they would find ``no surprises'' in Starr's
report.
</P>
<P>
   David Kendall, the president's lawyer, said Thursday that the
report is nothing more than a collection of prosecutors'
``contentions, claims and allegations and we look forward to the
chance to rebut them.''
</P>
<P>
   A copy of the report was not made available to The New York
Times, but the shape of the report was described in interviews on
Thursday with three lawyers who said they were familiar with its
contents.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers said the Starr report also pieces together evidence
that they say could indicate that the president had obstructed
justice, another article in the Watergate case.
</P>
<P>
   The twin pillars of that portion of the report are allegations
that Clinton played a role in an attempt by his friend, Vernon
Jordan, to find Ms. Lewinsky a job in the private sector last
December, the lawyers said. The report also lays out a case that
the president played an active role Ms. Lewinsky's decision to
return several presidential gifts, which had been sought by a
subpoena from the Jones lawyers, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Both actions were intended to keep Ms. Lewinsky from telling the
truth to the Jones lawyers about her sexual relationship with the
president, the prosecutors contend.
</P>
<P>
   In his grand jury testimony, Clinton denied that he had sought
to help Ms. Lewinsky secure a job or retrieve the gifts, his allies
have said.
</P>
<P>
   The report also details the fact that Clinton summoned his
secretary, Betty Currie, to the White House on Sunday, Jan. 18, the
day after Clinton was asked a series of questions about Ms.
Lewinsky, including private visits she had with Clinton, a lawyer
said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In February, a White House official dismissed the Currie meeting
as an effort by the president to ``refresh his recollection'' about
Ms. Lewinsky's visits and other matters. The report said that
Clinton had other motives for summoning Mrs. Currie on that Sunday
in January. It said that he asked her a series of questions in an
attempt to influence her as a potential witness in the Jones case,
the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors contend that Clinton also tried to interfere with
the Paula Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit against him as early as
the summer of 1997, the lawyers said. In May 1997, the Supreme
Court ruled, unanimously, that the Jones lawsuit would proceed
while Clinton was still in office. Within a week, Mrs. Jones'
lawyers had said they would attempt to interview under oath other
women linked to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   That summer, the report says, Clinton asked Ms. Lewinsky to keep
their relationship a secret. That request came six months before
the former White House intern was subpoenaed to testify in the
case, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers said he also encouraged Ms. Lewinsky to urge her friend
and another potential witness, Linda Tripp, to stay silent about a
White House volunteer named Kathleen Willey. Ms. Willey said she
resisted an unwanted sexual advance from the president just outside
the Oval Office. At the time, a Newsweek reporter was attempting to
interview Mrs. Tripp, who bumped into Ms. Willey shortly after the
alleged encounter.
</P>
<P>
   In the 140-page section that lays out the grounds for possible
impeachment proceedings, there are several ``salacious and
detailed'' references to sexual encounters between Clinton and Ms.
Lewinsky inside the president's private study near the Oval Office,
the lawyers said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer who is familiar with Starr's strategy said that
prosecutors felt they had to include such material in the section
of the report that discusses whether Clinton had lied to the grand
jury. Clinton denied in his grand jury testimony that he lied about
their relationship in his Jones deposition.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 17, Clinton testified to the grand jury that he had
``inappropriate intimate physical contact'' with Ms. Lewinsky. But
he insisted that the contacts did not meet the definition of
``sexual relations'' established in the Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in his address to the nation that evening, Clinton said
his answers in the Jones deposition about Ms. Lewinsky were
``legally accurate,'' though he acknowledged they were misleading.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say in the report, however, that Clinton lied before
the grand jury when he said that his sexual encounters with Ms.
Lewinsky did not constitute ``sexual relations,'' as defined in the
Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors argue that the president's decision not to answer
those questions compelled them to have Ms. Lewinsky return to the
grand jury and answer more detailed questions about the precise
nature of her sexual encounters with Clinton, the lawyers said.
Many of those graphic details are included in the report, including
a discussion of the now-infamous blue dress that Ms. Lewinsky
turned over to prosecutors, according to lawyers familiar with the
reports' contents.
</P>
<P>
   ``As uncomfortable as this topic may be, there was an obligation
to present it,'' one Starr ally said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A three-part definition of ``sexual relations'' was prepared by
Ms. Jones' lawyers before Clinton's Jan. 17 deposition. But in
responding to an objection of Clinton's lawyer, Judge Susan Webber
Wright of Federal District Court in Little Rock, Ark. limited the
definition from three parts to just Part I:
</P>
<P>
   ``For the purposes of this deposition, a person engages in
`sexual relations' when the person knowingly engages in or causes
contact with the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or
buttocks of any person with an intent to arouse or gratify the
sexual desire of any person.''
</P>
<P>
   But when he was asked in the deposition about Ms. Lewinsky,
Clinton consulted the same definition before he denied that he had
had sexual relations with the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the testimony of Ms. Lewinsky about what happened
during those encounters, prosecutors believe that denial was a lie
under oath, the lawyers said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the prosecutors contend there is evidence that the
president lied several times in the Jones deposition on Jan. 17.
They specifically highlight the president's denial that he had been
alone with Ms. Lewinsky, except on one or two occasions when she
handed him documents in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   While working around the clock over the Labor Day weekend and
intensely for the past several weeks, prosecutors in Starr's office
had always intended to file the report ``as quickly as possible,''
one lawyer said. There was originally a plan to send a referral
letter to Speaker Newt Gingrich and minority leader Richard
Gephardt on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But some lawyers in the office were concerned that Kendall would
possibly file a motion trying to limit the report's contents, or
demanding its early release, with U.S. District Judge Norma
Holloway Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, some staff members of the House Judiciary
Committee had sent signals, through suggestions to news reporters,
that they hoped Starr would write and submit an executive summary,
which could easily be made public. And, lawyers said Thursday,
prosecutors did in fact draw up a draft of an executive summary,
but Starr himself concluded that it was too argumentative and
scrapped the working draft of the executive summary.

   WASHINGTON _ Hillary Rodham Clinton declared her pride and
admiration for her husband on Thursday night, after President
Clinton spent much of the day offering emotional apologies to
senators and Cabinet members for misleading them about his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Standing beside the president at a Democratic fund-raiser here
on Thursday night, Mrs. Clinton gave him a rousing introduction,
saying that he had ``given faith again to people all over our
country, that the American dream can mean what it should mean.''
She praised his ``unrelenting determination to do what is best for
America.''
</P>
<P>
   The president hugged her as he stepped to the lectern, and she
beamingly patted his back with her right hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am profoundly grateful for every single day, even the worst
day, that I have had to serve as your president,'' Clinton told the
donors.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier on Thursday, the president, described as close to tears,
promised his Senate allies that he would do all he could to rebuild
their trust, and assured him that no more nasty surprises awaited
them about his personal conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Clinton is in some considerable personal pain,'' said
Sen. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, one of the Democrats whom
Clinton met with on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The president sat down with his Cabinet secretaries on Thursday
afternoon for their first meeting since Jan. 23, when he assured
them that he had not had a liaison with Monica Lewinsky. After that
meeting, four of the secretaries spoke before television cameras,
declaring that they believed him. Clinton did not directly refer to
that previous meeting, participants said.
</P>
<P>
   Several participants quoted scripture, and most were supportive
though critical of his behavior. Donna Shalala, the secretary of
health and human services was said to have told Clinton she was
appalled by his behavior with Ms. Lewinsky, though she said she
still supported him and his policies.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Cuomo, the secretary of housing and urban development,
said that Clinton, ``apologized and said that he owes this group a
special obligation because they have done so much for him. He said
he considered us like family.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright described the meeting as
``very sober and very moving.'' Albright emerged from the earlier
meeting in January to say, ``I believe the allegations are
completely untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that she told Clinton on Thursday that this was a ``sad
and difficult time.'' She said that she accepted his apology, and
did not express any frustration at having defended him publicly
before. ``I don't have that feeling,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One participant in the Cabinet meeting said that some
secretaries left the meeting still angry. ``Different people were
in different places,'' a Cabinet member said, speaking on condition
of anonymity. ``Some remained judgmental,
</P>
<P>
   The Cabinet meeting followed the session late on Thursday
morning with Senate Democrats, a replay of a meeting Clinton held
Wednesday morning with House Democrats in the same room, the Yellow
Oval Room of the White House residence.
</P>
<P>
   After just two days, such meetings have taken on a ritualistic
quality. According to White House aides and senators, the president
apologized and said he would do all he could to win back the
senators' trust, absorbed their criticisms and anger, and tried to
allay their fretting over the possibility of more damaging
disclosures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been a difficult conversation to have with a
friend,'' Torricelli said. ``It was an extraordinarily difficult
conversation to have with a friend who is also president of the
United States.''

AS RUBLE FLIP-FLOPS, RUSSIANS SEE A TRICK 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russians, long accustomed to uncertainty, have a
saying: ``Tomorrow's weather will be announced the day after
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   But even that famous unflappability is challenged by a currency
whose value has all the predictability of, well, the weather. In
the last week the ruble fell to as little as 5 cents, only to shoot
back up to 9 cents Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   So Russians who bought dollars as a safe haven earlier this week
discovered that the dollars were worth far less Thursday in rubles
_ maybe as much as 45 percent less.
</P>
<P>
   Such wild gyrations, accompanied by rocketing prices for things
like clothing, gasoline and meat, have left many Russians convinced
that somebody up there _ in the government, in the banks, in the
heavens, perhaps _ is toying with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``In psychological terms, it's very hard because you don't have
time to get adjusted to the next day's prices and exchange rates,''
said Nonna Serenko, a 32-year-old secretary. ``It seems to me that
no one who is making economic policy in the country cares about the
problem. They don't care about the lower classes who are using
stores and shops.''
</P>
<P>
   Moscow's popular mayor, Yuri Luzhkov, who is considered a
possible contender in the presidential election in 2000, announced
price freezes Thursday accompanied by threats to slap severe
penalties on importers and businesses that sharply increase prices.
</P>
<P>
   For those living outside of relatively affluent Moscow, the
currency swings are even more devastating because many Russians
have less of a financial cushion to ride out the chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm offended and miserable with the ruble,'' said Anna
Tankushna, who lives near Dzhankoy, a small Ukrainian town, and
came to Moscow to earn money selling vegetables on the street.
``It's very hard because our prices went up and all the goods
disappeared from the store.''
</P>
<P>
   So why has the ruble's value been acting like a yo-yo?
</P>
<P>
   In mid-August, after the Russian government announced it would
no longer defend the ruble's value by buying it on currency
exchanges, it began falling. As Russians hurried to convert their
weakening rubles into dollars, the ruble went into a free-fall.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as if on steroids, the ruble unexpectedly bulked up in the
last day or so. Optimists suggested that this represented the
financial market's vote of confidence in the nomination of Yevgeny
Primakov as Russia's new prime minister. But since financial
markets have virtually ground to a halt and investors continue to
flee Russia, that reasoning is dubious.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Russian government officials may have wanted to create
that impression. Although the central bank said it did not
intervene in currency markets to support the ruble Wednesday,
traders said the bank did, in fact, do a little bit of buying on
Moscow's thinly traded currency exchange.
</P>
<P>
   That gave the ruble a nudge upward. More important, it gave a
signal to banks and exchange shops _ which really set the exchange
rates that effect people's lives _ that the ruble might rise
further. Some privileged banks were the lucky beneficiaries of even
earlier signs that the ruble might rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Sept. 7, a government official turned to us and asked to
change about $32,000 into rubles,'' said Zinaida Stolyarova, a
senior executive with the Rossiyskiy Kredit Bank. ``And on Sept. 8
another important client asked to exchange about $200,000 into
rubles. These two facts created an impression that the exchange
rate would go down.''
</P>
<P>
   So up the ruble soared, providing a juicy one-day windfall for
currency dealers and creating the appearance of renewed financial
vigor in Russia, but taking another nasty bite out of the average
Russian's wallet.
</P>
<P>
   Some banks, however, said the ruble's sudden buoyancy had
nothing to do with machinations by those in control of the banking
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Banks have not been playing around,'' said Alexei Ostravosky,
head of money markets for Inkombank, a Moscow bank that has
prevented customers from withdrawing their savings and was recently
brought under government supervision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exchange rates have been the result of mass panic,'' he
said.

RECORD DROP IN BRAZILIAN MARKETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Brazilian markets, caving in under the
international financial crisis and the government's failure over
the last four years to make crucial changes, careered toward record
losses Thursday, after emergency measures over the last week proved
futile in ending the slide in investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
   As the Sao Paulo exchange fell, whizzing past the 11 percent
mark early Thursday morning and past 15 percent at 4:30 p.m., the
market here halted trading twice in one day, for the first time in
its history. When trading resumed, so did the selloffs, with the
market closing down 15.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Standard &AMP; Poor's lowered its country rating on Brazil to
negative, putting it in the same category as Jordan, Lebanon,
Paraguay and Bolivia, and as of 6:30 p.m., market sources said $1.7
billion in foreign reserves had poured out of the country. A week
ago, Moody's Investor's Service also downgraded Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   With the world's ninth-largest economy and half the continent's
population, Brazil is seen as a bellwether for the region, and the
country most capable of ushering in a Latin version of the
turbulence that has roiled Asia and Russia. On Thursday, the
selloff was hardly limited to Brazil. Markets fell 9.8 percent in
Mexico, 13.3 percent in Argentina and 7.4 percent in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bruising losses, President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso, who faces re-election in less than a month, struck a
defiant note Thursday, saying no further interest-rate increases
and spending cuts would follow those of the last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have reached, really, the maximum limit of what's possible
to do, without compromising the activities necessary for the
country to function,'' the president said in Brasilia Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The government's measures included raising interest rates to
29.75 percent from 19 percent, easing exports and pledges to cut $4
billion from the budget this year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, confidence in the country's equity and currency markets
was at a low ebb.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is no longer the stock market,'' said Andre
Zylberberg, a fund manager at Paradigm Financial Advisers. ``It's
the fear of Brazilian investors who are running to buy dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   The band between the official and street prices for dollars,
around 7 cents last week, widened to 28 cents Thursday, with
investors apparently betting on a devaluation. The dollar was
selling at $1.45 reais, up from $1.25 less than a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Even at that rate, most exchange houses said they were out of
dollars. ``The market doesn't believe in the government anymore,''
said the owner of one exchange house.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The first sign that the measures were doing little to bolster
the government's credibility came Wednesday, when the government
floated 14-day bonds, withdrawing as banks demanded 34 percent to
50 percent interest. On Thursday, the bonds sold at 31.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso said the country would likely take no further measures
to allay investor panic, which was not limited to Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot enter into a game here in which the market imposes
and decides,'' he said. ``There are moments when it is the country
that has to take control and make decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Malan, Brazil's finance minister, said the country had
sufficient foreign reserves to weather the currency run. Francisco
Lopes, director of monetary policy at the Central Bank, placed
reserves at $55 billion, a drop of $17 billion over the last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's horrible,'' said James Barrineau, Latin American equity
strategist at Salomon Smith Barney. ``It's piling on at this point.
People are all leaving for the exits at once, and it doesn't help
that the Dow is going down as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside and out of Brazil, the government is coming under
increasing criticism for Cardoso's failure to pass civil service,
social security and tax reforms during his four years in office.
</P>
<P>
   His economic plan cut inflation from 2,400 percent to about 1
percent this year, privatized state industries and welcomed direct
foreign investment. But structural changes to reduce government
spending have been left half-done, while the president spent
political capital and time winning a constitutional amendment
allowing him to run for re-election. The budget deficit has been
climbing, and is expected to hit 8 percent of gross domestic
product this year.
</P>
<P>
   As the election approaches, Cardoso's chickens are flocking home
to roost at the worst possible time, analysts and industry chiefs
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that Brazil has delayed four years, has now, at a
very inconvenient time, forced them to face an unfortunate choice,
but a very clear choice,'' said Lacey Gallagher, director of Latin
America sovereign ratings at Standard &AMP; Poor's. ``Either act
dramatically to stabilize the economy now or face some very serious
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gallagher said that the government's efforts to restore
confidence have been ``piecemeal'' at a time when the market was
demanding ``more than what's needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Haar, director of the Inter-American Business and Labor
Program at the University of Miami's North-South Center, said the
failure to make government more efficient has not been restricted
to Brazil, and not to the last four years. ``Latin American has
failed, since the debt crisis in 1982 and the Mexican peso crisis
of 1994, to go the other 50 yards,'' he said. ``These global trends
are showing the emperor has no clothes.''

 &HT;    FIRST LADY SAYS SHE IS 'VERY PROUD' OF 'MY HUSBAND'
 &HT;    680&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Facing an unprecedented Internet inquisition in the
court of public opinion, President Clinton got a ringing
testimonial Thursday from his wife and political soul mate, who
said she was ''very proud'' of her husband and his ''unrelenting
determination'' to do what's best for the country.
</P>
<P>
   While First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton stopped short of stating
that she had forgiven Clinton for his admitted affair with Monica
Lewinsky, she praised ''my husband'' effusively.
</P>
<P>
   ''Day after day I've seen his determination, his unrelenting
determination, to do what is best for America, and for the children
who will inherit our country,'' she said as she introduced Clinton
before a group of Democratic business executives.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton left no doubt that, politically and personally, she
is prepared once again to stand by her man.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very proud of the person I'm privileged to introduce,''
she said. ''I'm proud of his leadership, I'm proud of his
commitment, I'm proud of what he gives our country and all of us
everyday by his commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning from the podium as the president approached, the first
lady held him in a lingering embrace before he stepped up to the
microphone to acknowledge her support.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can only hope you know what I'm feeling _ for you, and for
my wife and for my country,'' Clinton told the group, the
Democratic Business Council. ''I think you do,'' Clinton said to
enthusiastic applause, ''and I thank you more than you can possibly
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's display of support, after days of public silence,
capped a day Clinton devoted largely to trying to mend fences with
his own supporters. Earlier, he held what attendees described as
difficult and emotional White House meetings with 10 Senate
Democrats and with his own cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   ''He shared his feelings and apologized to us personally,''
Senate Minority Leader Thomas Daschle, D-S.D., told reporters. ''We
have expressed the hope that the president will continue to
demonstrate his contrition to his family, to his friends, and to
the American people, and he's indicated a desire to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said ''we all accept his apology,'' provided the report
of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr doesn't contain fresh
information that further damages the president's already eroded
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said Clinton was asked whether additional revelations
could be expected from the report, ''and his answer was that no,
there were no surprises.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Clinton called together his cabinet, It was an
eerie reprise of their most recent gathering last January, when
Clinton denied, as he did to the American public, ever having had
an affair with Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Following the January session, four cabinet members _ Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright, Education Secretary Richard Riley,
Commerce Secretary William Daley, and Secretary of Health and Human
Services Donna Shalala _ marched out to announce that they believed
the president's denials.
</P>
<P>
   None of those showed up to talk with reporters after Thursday's
meeting, though several other cabinet members did emerge.
</P>
<P>
   ''He apologized, he is deeply sorry for what has happened, he
did take the time to listen to people,'' said Carol Browner,
director of the Environmental Protection Agency. ''Every single
person who spoke said they want to get on with doing the nation's
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, however, said Clinton needs
to formally the address the American people to personally and
directly express the contrition he offered Thursday to his most
senior advisors.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would frankly like all Americans to hear the kind of
discussion that we had with him,'' Glickman said, as still others
voiced their conviction that Clinton would not be forced out of
office by the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a president who has not lost heart,'' said
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater. ''That will carry us
through.''

   As White House officials rallied around the president, the House
Rules Committee was reviewing a plan to release Starr's 445-page
report on the Lewinsky matter over the Internet as early as Friday
afternoon, pending approval by the full House Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The release of the Starr report would be an embarrassing setback
for Clinton, who has sought to delay public dissemination of the
document until his lawyers could review and respond to it.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's office has said only that the report contains
''substantial and credible information ...that may constitute
grounds for impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry dismissed questions about the content of the report as
speculative, since the report has yet to be made public. Clinton's
personal attorney, David Kendall, however, told reporters on
Wednesday that the report contained ''no basis for impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   In a day of fast-moving developments, however, it was the
resounding support Clinton received from his wife that seemed most
likely to resonate with Americans as they confront the details of
the Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we're about, what all of us in this room stand for and
believe in, is much bigger than any one person,'' she said. ''But
none of what has been done in the last five and a half years to put
our country on the right track, heading in the right direction for
the future, could have been done without the leadership of one
particular person,'' she said, referring to the president.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over the last five and a half years I have personally seen how
hard he has worked. I've seen how he's responded day in and day out
to the challenges that face all Americans, and how he's given faith
again to people all over our country, that the American dream can
mean what it should mean for people today and tomorrow.''

NORTHWEST AND PILOTS UNION GAIN TENTATIVE ACCORD 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Negotiators for Northwest Airlines and its pilots union reached
a tentative agreement Thursday to settle their bitter labor
dispute, but the accord stopped short of immediately ending a
13-day strike that has disrupted travel in Midwest and South
because the union still has to decide whether to accept it.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when most of the focus in Washington was on the
political difficulties facing President Clinton, he announced the
breakthrough personally in an evening statement to reporters on the
White House lawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the strike is over,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and Transportation
Secretary Rodney Slater, Clinton praised the leaders at Northwest
and the Air Line Pilots Association and thanked the members of his
administration, including Bruce Lindsey, the White House deputy
counsel who was instrumental in bringing about the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there are a lot of people who depend on Northwest who
are relieved tonight,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   But it was still not clear Thursday when Northwest would begin
flying again. In a statement released after the president's
comments, the pilots union said its 17-member governing master
executive council would meet in Minneapolis on Saturday to decide
whether to approve the agreement. Until then, the pilots would
remain on strike, it added. The airline has said it will take eight
to 10 days after the pilots agree to return to work before the
airline can resume its full schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The union said it would not release details of the tentative
agreement until the executive council had examined it. Northwest
said it would not discuss details of the agreement until the union
took action on it.
</P>
<P>
   The Northwest pilots strike has been the longest against an
airline since 1989, when machinists shut down Eastern Airlines. All
of Northwest's nearly 1,700 flights have been grounded, sharply
reducing air travel in Northwest's hubs in Detroit, Minneapolis and
Memphis and the surrounding regions, where the airline was
dominant.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hardest hit states has been North Dakota, which
depends on Northwest for almost all of its air service. But in
cities like Detroit and Minneapolis, the disruption from the strike
was less than many people had expected. Other airlines increased
their flights to the cities, and businesses made other
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of disruption undermined dire predictions made by
Northwest before the strike as it tried to put pressure on Clinton
to use his executive powers to order the pilots back to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has happened is that passengers have found it easier to
book elsewhere and there has been fall off of traffic,'' said
Robert Litan, the director of economic studies at the Brookings
Institution who was hired by Northwest to assess the economic
damage of a strike.
</P>
<P>
   Litan's study said the damage would equal $730 million in the
strike's first 10 days. But this week he said his revised estimate
was about two-thirds of his original estimate with more than half
coming from the fact that Northwest ceased operations and laid off
30,000 of its 51,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots walked out on Aug. 29 after two years of
negotiations. The main issue in the dispute was pay. The pilots
wanted a substantial raise to make up for wage concessions they
made in 1993 that helped Northwest avoid bankruptcy. They were also
concerned that Northwest would shift their workload to smaller
commuter jets flown by pilots who are paid much smaller salaries.
</P>
<P>
   The airline said that it was willing to give the pilots a pay
hike but that it could not afford to pay them more than their
counterparts at its three larger competitors: United Airlines,
American Airlines, and Delta Airlines. The union says the pilots
receive an average salary of $120,000 a year; the company puts that
figure at $133,000.
</P>
<P>
   But behind those apparently narrow differences were years of
simmering resentment on both sides. The pilots accused Northwest of
dragging its feet while the airline racked up record profits and
its top executives cashed in stock options worth millions. The
company said a group of radical leaders at the pilots union had
been spoiling for a strike since early 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The hard feelings had prevented the two sides from returning to
the bargaining table. Slater called John Dasburg, Northwest's chief
executive, and J. Randolph Babbitt, president of the Air Line
Pilots Association, to a meeting in Washington last weekend to see
whether there were areas of compromise. Negotiators for both sides
met separately in Chicago last weekend with federal mediators.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not until Lindsey flew to Minneapolis with Slater on
Tuesday afternoon that negotiations began again in earnest, said
those involved in the discussions. By late Wednesday night, after a
long day of bargaining, the pilots had a made a compromise offer
and the company had responded. A deal seemed within reach.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, Lindsey was at the airport preparing to leave
when he received a call from the White House. The pilots union was
asking for him to return to the talks to help hammer out a
settlement. By afternoon, the two sides had a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton then called Dasburg and Babbitt to urge both men to wrap
up the negotiations as soon as possible, an administration official
said.
</P>
<P>
   One person involved in the negotiations who insisted on
anonymity said, ``Every economic and job security issue has been
dealt with and resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the union leaders will approve the the deal is an open
question. Over the summer, Northwest reached an accord with
negotiators for the International Association of Machinists, which
represent 27,000 workers, but the contract was overwhelmingly
rejected by members who voted on it in July.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the pilot leaders approve the contract, the damage to
the airline already has been substantial.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts estimate that Northwest has lost $250
million to $300 million to date and it is likely to lose more as it
begins fare discounts and other promotions to draw back passengers.
The carrier's stock price has fallen more than 60 percent since the
spring, in large part because of the strike.

ADVERTISING: BRITISH AGENCY OPENS N.Y. OFFICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An upstart British agency with a reputation for
quirky, cheeky work is making its long-awaited entry into the U.S.
advertising market by opening an office in New York to be led by an
Anglo-American executive team.
</P>
<P>
   Bartle Bogle Hegarty, the hot creative shop with estimated
billings last year of $359.1 million, is not big enough to make the
list compiled by Advertising Age of the world's 50 largest
agencies. But its influence is disproportionate to its size as the
creative, strategic and brand-building achievements of Bartle Bogle
have attracted a roster of blue-chip advertisers like Coca-Cola
Co., Lego Group, Levi Strauss Associates, Remy Cointreau SA, Time
Warner Inc. and Unilever.
</P>
<P>
   Bartle Bogle, founded in London in 1982, initially expanded two
years ago by starting an Asian-Pacific operation in Singapore. The
agency's top leaders have long discussed a foray onto Madison
Avenue to better serve American-based clients. Those discussions
continued after a startling deal in December by which the giant
Chicago-based Leo Burnett Co. acquired 49 percent of Bartle Bogle.
</P>
<P>
   Some humorous Bartle Bogle commercials for Levi's jeans and
Dockers pants have already appeared in this country. And the
agency's popular British print and poster campaign for Boddingtons
Pub Ale, brewed by Whitbread PLC, has been adapted for American
drinkers by a New York agency.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is also the lure that has attracted other agencies
from Britain like Leagas Delaney and M&AMP;C Saatchi: The United States
remains the largest and most lucrative advertising market. ``The
U.S. has always been part of the game plan,'' said Cindy Gallop, a
nine-year Bartle Bogle employee who will head the New York office
as president of BBH USA. ``This completes the circle.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gallop, 38, was a core member of the Bartle Bogle group that
founded the Singapore office and she served as deputy managing
director of BBH Asia-Pacific. She left there at the end of May to
return to London to prepare for the task ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly not coming to this market with excessive
expectations,'' Ms. Gallop said in a telephone interview from the
temporary space being occupied by BBH USA in downtown Manhattan.
``We acknowledge it's a new challenge for us because while we're
reasonably well known within the industry, a lot of clients have
never heard of BBH.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we hope clients here will want to work with an agency that
approaches the business the way we do, and the nature of the BBH
product seems to be something the U.S. market was saying there was
a need for.''
</P>
<P>
   After debating whether to begin American operations in New York
or San Francisco, Bartle Bogle executives chose New York early this
year and planning proceeded toward a goal of opening the office in
the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York makes sense in terms of its accessibility to both
clients and services,'' Ms. Gallop said. ``It's part of the
well-worn path.''
</P>
<P>
   And there is a perception that the New York advertising scene
has recently been somnolent compared with, say, the creative
ferment in cities like Minneapolis and San Francisco. That offers a
newcomer like Bartle Bogle room to grow.
</P>
<P>
   The other top executive at BBH New York is Ty Montague, a
copywriter with a lengthy list of credits for campaigns for such
New York agencies as Chiat/Day; Goldsmith/Jeffrey; Lowe &AMP;
Partners/SMS, part of the Lowe Group unit of Interpublic Group of
Cos.; Ogilvy &AMP; Mather, owned by WPP Group PLC, and Scali, McCabe,
Sloves.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1994, Montague opened a consulting company, Montague &AMP;,
in Norwalk, Conn., where his clients included creatively strong
agencies like Fallon McElligott in Minneapolis and Wieden &AMP; Kennedy
in Portland, Ore. Between his previous agency work and his projects
at Montague &AMP; _ which is being closed as Montague joins Bartle
Bogle _ he has experience on such brands as Black &AMP; Decker,
Coca-Cola, MTV, Mercedes-Benz, Reebok and Volvo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a rather surprising turn of events for me,'' Montague,
35, said about becoming creative director at BBH USA. ``But when
John Hegarty calls you, you take that call.'' His reference was to
the chairman and creative director of Bartle Bogle, who has been
devoting much time on the New York venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though BBH's roots are British,'' Montague said, ``its values
are universal, particularly its deep strategic thinking on brands
and its belief that human beings are inherently fascinated by
story-telling. Those are the kinds of ideas that cross borders
effortlessly.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gallop said that the new office was ``working with clients
already, but I'm afraid I can't be specific at the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what types of accounts the agency wanted in New York, Ms.
Gallop offered a lesson in British agency lingo by replying, ``As
with any start-up, we'd love a car, an airline, an f.m.c.g.
client.''
</P>
<P>
   Translated, that's fast-moving consumer goods _ British parlance
for what Madison Avenue refers to as packaged goods.

CAMMI GRANATO WALKS THE NHL TALK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Cammi Granato says she's been backed into the
``what's this girl doing here?'' corner too many times to count.
</P>
<P>
   So if she hears any sort of obnoxious sports-guy complaint about
the Kings' highly progressive move to hire her as the NHL's lone
female analyst this season, que sera.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, what meathead is going to take the chance of getting a
fat lip from the captain of the Olympic gold-medal-winning U.S.
women's hockey team?
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there will be some resistance, but I'm used to it,''
said the 27-year-old, who signed a three-year deal with the team
this week. Granato will work as Nick Nickson's partner on radio,
represent the Kings in community relations activities and help
organize a women's hockey festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been pretty comfortable around the media, and
during the Olympics, that experience was insane. I'm not going to
be an overnight success. It'll be an education process, but I have
so many resources around here. I'll take it one day at a time and
see how it all works out.''
</P>
<P>
   Kings president Tim Leiweke emphasizes that this ``is not a
gimmick'' or an attempt to cash in on Granato's Olympic success.
Maybe he needed to say that for the record, but there's no doubt of
the team's intentions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I compare it to what ESPN has done with Julie Fouty (a U.S.
women's soccer star who was a studio commentator during the men's
World Cup this past summer) and even Mary Carillo on men's
tennis,'' said Jim Fox, the team's TV analyst who starts his ninth
season with Bob Miller and who has already given Granato a sort of
crash course in Hockey Analyst 101.
</P>
<P>
   Adds Nickson, working with his third regular partner in the last
nine years: ``Realistically, anyone going into this profession
needs time to develop confidence and go through the learning
process. But she knows hockey and as long as we can translate that,
she'll be accepted. She was front and center during the Olympics.
Really, who's more qualified as far as name recognition and the
success she's had on the ice?
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at it as gaining a perspective of the game from a woman
instead of gaining a woman's perspective of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings expect her to miss a handful of games during the
season as she continues to play for the U.S. women's team _ the
winger is the squad's all-time leading scorer. A post-Olympic
tournament will take two weeks of her time in December. She'll also
need three weeks in March for tryouts for the team she's been part
of since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   When she's off playing, the Kings will use former player Darryl
Evans with Nickson. Mike Allison, Nickson's partner the last three
years, left to become a teacher in Minnesota after looking into
other broadcasting jobs. Nickson, who also worked with Brian
Engblom for four years before ESPN scooped him up, started his
radio play-by-play duties with then-injured Kings player Tom
Laidlaw as his sidekick.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a few more years I should get my Master's degree in
broadcasting,'' professor Nickson joked.
</P>
<P>
   The only other woman to ever have been a broadcast analyst was
Sherry Ross, a current New York Daily News sportswriter who did
color for the New Jersey Devils' radio games from 1992-95.
Granato's first game with Nickson will be the Kings' exhibition
opener a week from Saturday when they face Colorado at the MGM
Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. &QL; 
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH...
</P>
<P>
   ABC's ``Monday Night Football'' opener pulled down a 14.8 rating
and 24 share nationally, which won the night against the other
networks but was a drop from the 16.7/27 average last season. Did
the early kickoff have anything to do with it? L.A.'s rating
(16.1/28) didn't seem to make much of a case for that. In fact, an
ABC spokesman pointed out that the East Coast 8-to-11 p.m.
prime-time window was actually up 20 percent from last year. The
reason for the national dip could be because the Denver-New England
game was the first time in 17 years that MNF had an all-AFC matchup
for its opener. AFC traditionally has the smaller TV markets. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WHAT SMOKES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Save that Sept. 14 issue that Sports Illustrated mailed out to
subscribers Wednesday with Mark McGwire on the cover hitting home
run No.61. It might not be the one you find on newsstands today.
For the first time in its 44-year history, SI has reprinted an
already-issued issue, slapping a new McGwire cover on it with the
headline ``62!.... September 8, 1988'' and shipping out a
half-million copies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ The St. Louis Post-Dispatch held off running McGwire-related
ads, posters and radio commercials until after he set the record. A
newspaper spokesman said it was because the paper did not want to
exploit the feat. The paper's circulation of 325,000 went to more
than 900,000 by Wednesday night. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ESPN.com, which had three reporters at Tuesday's
Cardinals-Cubs game, had a headline on its Web site home page that
said ``Gone! McGwire hits 62nd'' as McGwire was touching third
base, reports the Sports Business Daily. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Marv Albert and Heather Faulkiner were married Wednesday in a
small, private ceremony in Manhattan. The couple has registered for
gifts at (fill in the punchline). &QL; 
WHAT CHOKES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Amid the barrage of ratings info that Fox issued for its Mark
McGwire 62nd home-run game telecast Tuesday, it mentioned that its
owned-and-operate St. Louis affiliate KTVI posted a 43.4 rating and
a 59 share, which means about two-thirds of all TV sets on in the
city were tuned to the game. So what were the other third possibly
watching? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ QVC admits that it broke into its ``regular programming'' _
what could that have been? _ just four seconds after No. 62 was hit
and sold more than 100,000 baseball-related items totaling more
than $2.6 million, which only reinforces the belief that impulse
buying is a disease. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Fox goes back to regional baseball coverage Saturday. Meaning
the St. Louis-Houston game, featuring Randy Johnson serving up
fastballs to his former USC teammate, will be shown to 69 percent
of the country, and the L.A. market is among the eight percent that
will see the Angels game at Baltimore at 10 a.m. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ McGwire's participation in the ``I'm going to Disneyland'' ad,
which aired on Disney-owned ESPN within hours of his 62nd home run
Tuesday. Disneyland? Hey, Mark, you're from Orange County,
remember? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Dick Vitale will be inducted in the Basketball Hall of Fame in
Springfield, Mass., under the auspices of the Curt Gowdy Award,
which is given to a media member who ``makes an outstanding
contribution to basketball.'' The contribution would be the
advancement of technology in TV volume control.

MOYA BEATS LARSSON TO GAIN SEMIFINALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ His past US Opens certainly gave Carlos Moya little
encouragement entering this year's event.
</P>
<P>
   A summer of tennis futility, losses in the first round of three
straight tournaments, only made matters worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that time, I thought, `I cannot beat anyone,''' Moya said.
``My confidence was below zero, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   So much for riding high into the last of the year's Grand Slam
tournaments. Moya, expecting little, has come up with a lot and
Thursday earned a spot in tomorow's semifinals with a solid 6-4,
6-3, 6-3 win over Magnus Larsson. Moya now faces the winner of last
night's match between Thomas Johansson and Mark Philippoussis in
the semifinal of the less heralded.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Patrick Rafter and four-time winner Pete
Sampras, both of whom advanaced Wednesday, face off in the other
semi.
</P>
<P>
   Larsson never had a chance. Only once did he have a break point
on Moya's service, and the No. 10 seed served himself out of
trouble in that game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just took better care of the ball than I,'' Larsson said.
``It's easy. I made a lot of of errors in the beginning. Then I
started thinking about the swing, got too careful, and still
missed. It was not a good day.''
</P>
<P>
   Moya, 22, knows a little about those. He won his first Slam
title at the French Open last spring, went out in the second round
at Wimbledon, then began to struggle as this tournament approached.
</P>
<P>
   He lost to Paul Haarhuis in the first round of a smaller tour
clay-court event in Croatia where he was the No. 1 seed. Then he
moved on to hard courts and the hard times continued. He lost his
first match in Cincinnati to Jerome Golmard, his first in
Indianapolis to Johansson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no confidence at all,'' Moya said. ``I thought I cannot
beat anyone the way I was playing.''
</P>
<P>
   He got here and things started to turn.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Puerta had worked his way back into their first-round
match but then had to retire with severe leg cramps at 6-1, 7-6
(7-4), 6-7 (7-3), 4-4. Moya helped carry him off the court.
</P>
<P>
   He's been escorting players off the court since. He lost the
first two sets, 6-3, 6-1, to Michael Chang and was in big trouble.
He fought off three match points, then came back to beat Chang, who
simply doesn't lose five-set matches, in five sets.
</P>
<P>
   Next up was up-and-coming American Jan-Michael Gambill. Gambill
was up a break and serving at 4-3 and 40-15 in the fifth set, and
Moya escaped that one, too.
</P>
<P>
   Moya, who lost in the first round here last year and in the
second the previous year, hasn't dropped a set in his last two
matches.
</P>
<P>
   He's renewed and ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives you a lot of power,'' Moya said. ``You think that
nobody can beat you right now because they didn't do it before.''
</P>
<P>
   Moya took exactly 90 minutes to put Larsson away. He used his
chances to break efficiently. He had two break points in the first
set and used one for the only break he needed. In the second set,
he had two more break points and pounced on both.
</P>
<P>
   Larsson wiggled free of a couple of break points early in the
third set, but then came the eighth game. Moya had a couple of more
break points, and Larson survived those, too. He couldn't escape
the third, and when his forehand went wide, Moya had the break and
a 5-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   He served out the match, ending it with his only ace of the day.
</P>

 &HT;    Democrats urge delay for Clinton
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman and Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- The nation is expected to get its first look today
at independent counsel Kenneth Starr's case against President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on a
resolution that would make public 445 pages of the voluminous
report Starr delivered to Congress on Wednesday, including 140
pages that detail possible grounds for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans believe they will have sufficient support to
overcome Democratic objections that Clinton's lawyers should have a
chance to review the report before it becomes public.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders intend to post the material at government sites on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Sources familiar with Starr's report told The Associated Press
that the material contains allegations that Clinton committed
perjury, obstruction of justice, witness tampering and abuse of
power.
</P>
<P>
   The report specifically alleges that Clinton lied under oath
both in his sworn deposition in the Paula Jones civil lawsuit in
January and again in his grand jury testimony last month, when he
was questioned about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky,
according to AP's sources.
</P>
<P>
   While promising cooperation, the committee chairman and the
panel's senior Democrat clashed over plans to make public the first
part of Starr's report without giving Clinton's lawyers a chance to
review it.
</P>
<P>
   The report ``belongs to the American people, and they have a
right to know its content,'' said Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.), the
committee chairman.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), the ranking Democrat,
countered, ``The House of Representatives is not the United States
Postal Service.''
</P>
<P>
   Conyers said fairness dictates that Clinton should have the same
right to review the material that the House gives members accused
of violating ethics rules. Members get 10 days to look at charges
before they are made public.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's committee will review by Sept. 28 the rest of the
material Starr submitted to determine how much of it can be made
public. The material includes 2,600 pages of telephone logs and
transcripts from the Jones lawsuit as well as 17 additional boxes
of grand jury transcripts, audio tapes and video tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``People's reputations are at risk here,'' Hyde said. ``The bias
is to release it all. The urge is to release it all.''
</P>
<P>
   The disagreement over public access was the first crack to
emerge Thursday in the facade of bipartisan cooperation surrounding
the House's handling of the Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Newt Gingrich, in an interview on CNN, said providing a
special prosecutor's report to a target for review before public
release ``has never been done before. It was never done during
Watergate, never done in Iran-Contra.''
</P>
<P>
   He did offer to make the House Internet site available to
Clinton's lawyer for ``whatever answers he wants to give.''
</P>
<P>
   David Kendall, Clinton's private lawyer, White House Chief
Counsel Charles Ruff and John Podesta, Clinton's deputy chief of
staff, met with Hyde on Thursday, but did not reach agreement on
reviewing the report.
</P>
<P>
   Ardent defenders such as Georgia Democratic Rep. John Lewis
argued throughout the day that it was ``unfair'' to deny the
president time to review the charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Gingrich had nearly a week to review and rebut the
ethics charges filed against him that led to a reprimand and
$300,000 fine last year, Lewis said, ``It is the only fair thing to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Richard Armey of Texas rejected the
parallel. ``They are different cases. They are matters of largely
different circumstances,'' Armey said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Linder of Georgia, chairman of House Republicans'
campaign committee, had elections on his mind: ``Remember how Newt
talked about gains of 10 to 40 seats in the House? This is the
scenario for 40.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich and other GOP leaders in the House and Senate mainly
tried to portray congressional Republicans as focusing on the
legislative agenda, including a potential $70 billion to $80
billion tax cut, and leaving possible impeachment proceedings to
Hyde.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't talk at all about this other matter,'' Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi told reporters at a
meeting in Gingrich's office.
</P>
<P>
   But in an indication that the Starr report is not far from their
minds, Gingrich said the annual spending bills Republicans would
soon start sending to the White House would not give Clinton
political room to provoke a fight with Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no excuse for the president to try to distract
attention by shutting down the government,'' Gingrich said.

 &HT;    Fake bomb targets TVA accuser
 &HT;    By John Harmon
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   An atomic whistleblower, who has publicly criticized the
operation of the Tennessee Valley Authority's Watts Bar Nuclear
Power Plant, has received numerous threats over the past four
months and is afraid to return to work.
</P>
<P>
   Several nuclear safety adovcates contended Thursday that the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission is not doing enough to protect
whistleblowers at Watts Bar. The plant is one of three TVA sites
being considered by the U.S. Department of Energy for a contract to
manufacture material for nuclear bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of sending inspectors to the Watts Bar site to determine
if federal regulations protecting nuclear workers are being
violated, NRC is content with merely monitoring the situation from
(the regional office in) Atlanta,'' charged David Lochbaum of the
Union of Concerned Scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Overall said Thursday he has received 16 threats since a
federal administrative law judge in April found that the TVA
illegally fired Curtis Overall of Cleveland, Tenn. for his
reporting potential safety violations at Watts Bar in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   One of the threats was written on a TVA interoffice memo and
told Overall to leave Watts Bar... or else,'' said Lochbaum.
</P>
<P>
   Overall had been back on the job since July by judge's order,
while TVA appeals the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not planning on returning back to work until they can
provide me with a safe work environment, which they can't do, which
is obvious,'' said a shaken Overall.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent threat came Wednesday when Curtis Overall, a
17-year TVA employee, found in the back of his pick up truck a
package that was made to look like a bomb, but was a fake,''
confirmed a spokesman for the Cleveland Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms are
investigating. The matter has also be turned over to the TVA
inspector general, said TVA spokesman John Moulton. And a NRC
spokesman said that agency was also looking into the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Overall identified possible flaws in the Watts Bar ice condenser
unit, a safety system that cools and contains the release of
radioactive steam in the event of an accident.
</P>
<P>
   Though a NRC official said earlier this year inspectors had
found no serious problems with the Watts Bar ice condenser,
Overall's report did tip the NRC to find 29 violations at a
similiarly-designed D.C. Cook plant in Michigan. Cook has been
shutdown since January for repairs to its ice condenser.
</P>
<P>
   In May Overall was one of several whistleblowers to speak at a
press conference in Washington about problems in the nuclear
industry.

SENATE PANEL BLOCKS NEW FUNDS FOR IMF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., Md., Wis.)  (js) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rejecting pleas by the administration, a key House
committee voted Thursday against full financing for the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The action appears to doom efforts by the administration and the
Senate, which has already approved full funding, to replenish the
fund's reserves. But Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., chairman of the
Appropriations Committee, held out the possibility that the House
could still approve the money under an agreement with the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   It is uncertain if Livingston, who conceded Thursday that he had
been on ``both sides of this issue,'' will prevail.
</P>
<P>
   His committee, egged on by Rep. Tom DeLay, the third-ranking
Republican in the House, voted largely along party lines Thursday
to deny the request for $18 billion. Instead the committee voted
30-22 to provide only $3.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston told the committee he was voting against full
financing in order to buy time to draw up more stringent operating
conditions for the fund. He added that he would probably vote to
approve full financing later.
</P>
<P>
   He told reporters that those who want the agency to die ``may
well predominate,'' but added: ``My suspicion is that there is
enough support among both parties in both houses that you're going
to have an IMF''
</P>
<P>
   White House Budget Director Jacob Lew wrote to Livingston
Thursday, saying the full $18 billion is critical because the
fund's resources are so low. ``To reject or delay this funding not
only would undermine America's leadership in the world, it also
would expose American workers, savers, farmers and businesses to
unacceptable economic risks,'' Lew wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not at all clear that in the next few weeks, as time
runs out and Congress becomes overwhelmed with possible impeachment
proceedings against President Clinton, the committee will be able
to focus on the technical details.
</P>
<P>
   As the committee voted against full funding, it approved the
overall $16.2-billion bill to finance other foreign operations. But
the bill has other contentious provisions and many Republicans
expect that most of the 13 appropriation bills needed to keep the
government running after Oct. 1 will be folded together in one big
package later _ a chaotic process that could bode ill for issues
like the IMF if conservatives hold firm.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The bad economic news from Russia and Asia has made some
Republicans more reluctant to keep financing the agency. DeLay
rushed to the committee meeting Thursday for only a few minutes to
talk about the fund, leaving talks with other members on how to
handle possible impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay said it would be wrong for U.S. taxpayers to finance the
agency while the agency, which he described as an anachronism in
today's global economy, refused to make public its own budget and
lending practices.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the agency had lost sight of its original mission.
``Instead of providing needed cash to basically sound enterprises,
the IMF is now bailing out the bankrupt,'' he said. He said the
fund needed more money to back risky investments and ``perpetuate
this bail-out cycle.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing up for the additional money were several Democrats, who
said the agency needed to be reformed but that America should send
a strong signal to stem the tide of free-falling markets around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all of its weaknesses, the IMF is one of the few tools we
have available to stabilize currencies,'' said Rep. David Obey,
D-Wis. Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said, ``The psychology of U.S.
action has significant and almost immediate ramifications. What we
do matters.''

CLINTON REACHES OUT WITH MORE APOLOGIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES AND BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton continued a campaign to shore up
support among his allies Thursday, as the White House hastily
prepared to mount a strident counterattack against the report of
independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton issued a round of apologies to key Democratic
senators and later to his own Cabinet, advisers planned a
retaliation that will begin this afternoon, after the release of
Starr's report, and last through the weekend. This strategy, which
conforms to customary White House practice, is meant to stem what
high-level aides fear will be a massive loss of support when
details of the Starr report become publicly known.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the private declaration of a strategy, however, some
leading Democrats described a White House in bedlam, with the
president receiving little help from his wife, who has been his top
political adviser and defender in his toughest challenges. Nor has
he been assisted much by some of his most trusted aides, who feel
wounded by his lies and are loath to commit themselves further
until they see the Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   There was little coordination Thursday between the White House
and Capitol Hill, and the attempts by Clinton advisers to guide
Democratic lawmakers met with little success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's going in a different direction,'' said a key
Democrat, talking on the condition of anonymity. ``Me, I'm not
going marching around for them. I didn't cause this.''
</P>
<P>
   One uncertainty is the role that Hillary Rodham Clinton will
play in defending her husband. Thursday, she ventured out for what
have been rare public appearances since the president acknowledged
on Aug. 17 that he had an inappropriate relationship with former
White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton spoke in the White House East Room for an event
spotlighting the prevention of colon cancer and appeared with her
husband when he announced a settlement of the Northwest Airlines
strike. In the evening, she introduced the president at a
Democratic fund-raising dinner at a downtown hotel. She did not
speak at the Northwest announcement and did not address the
Lewinsky scandal at any time.
</P>
<P>
   In introducing Clinton at the fund-raiser, Hillary Clinton said:
``I am proud of his leadership; I am proud of his commitment.''
When he rose to speak, he awkwardly hugged her; she patted him on
the back.
</P>
<P>
   After the cancer-prevention event, Hillary Clinton's
spokeswoman, Marsha Berry, said that the first lady ``stresses her
support, her love and her forgiveness of him.''
</P>
<P>
   White House aides refused to speculate on why Hillary Clinton
has not offered her ususal vigorous defense of the president since
his confession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the American people would well understand that she can
only do that when she feels that she is ready and wants to say
something,'' said White House Press Secretary Michael D. McCurry.
``And that's entirely up to her. And I think most Americans would
fully understand that and appreciate that.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the first lady's role, White House aides and advisers
say they expect their strategy for saving the Clinton presidency to
constantly evolve and include a series of small, tactical moves
designed day-by-day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last several days make it pretty clear you have to be able
to adjust to the development of events as they come along,''
McCurry said. ``So I'm not going to tell you that we have an
iron-clad strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Clinton lawyers and spokesmen will address what
they consider the most damning specifics of the report by Friday
night, aides said. Lawyers will then work through the night to
compile a more detailed, written rebuttal to the Starr report that
will be publicly presented either tomorrow or Sunday, according to
aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the report comes out, we will have to deal with that
immediately,'' said one senior White House official. ``We will have
some comment on something in the same cycle.''
</P>
<P>
   That official said that as early as next week, the White House
will look to hire additional lawyers and advisers to address the
Starr report, sway public opinon, and lobby the Congress. One name
commonly mentioned: George Mitchell, a former Senate majority
leader from Maine and the special envoy to the Northern Ireland
peace process.
</P>
<P>
   White House senior aides said Mitchell has agreed to help out,
but could not commit to a full-time assignment because of personal
obligations.
</P>
<P>
   The aides said that Clinton was not considering resignation and
will argue that he has not committed an impeachable offense. ``I
think everyone knows Bill Clinton, knows him well enough, and he's
quite adamant about it,'' McCurry said. Even so, McCurry said he
could not ``predict the future.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, the president continued summoning Democratic
supporters, colleagues, and friends to the White House to offer
apologies in between tending to the business of government.
</P>
<P>
   In a White House Roosevelt Room ceremony, during which he
saluted 20 recipients of awards in science, math, and technology as
part of the administration's science program, Clinton strung the
two together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me say I'm quite well aware that we're starting a little
late today, and I regret that,'' he said. ``But I was in an
extended meeting with the senators from my own party, a part of
this process I am going through of talking to people with whom I
work and with whom I must work in your behalf, to ask for their
understanding, their forgiveness, and their commitment not to let
the events of the moment in Washington deter us from doing the
people's work here and building the future of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was joined by Vice President Al Gore in the morning
session with Democratic Senate leaders in the White House
residence, at which he offered apologies to them for his
relationship with Lewinsky and lying about it. On Wednesday, he
held a similiar meeting with House Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought his demeanor was of extreme sincerity,'' said
Senator Wendell H. Ford of Kentucky. ``He said it took a while for
him to come to grips with the enormity'' of what he had done.
``There was a lot of pressure on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Like House members the day before, the senators asked Clinton
whether they should expect any ``surprises'' from Starr's report to
which the president answered no, according to Senate Democratic
Leader Thomas Daschle of South Dakota. He said that neither the
subject of impeachment or resignation came up.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton held a similiar meeting later in the day with his
Cabinet, a meeting that awakened memories of the time in January
when several Cabinet secretaries publicly stated that they believed
Clinton's denial of having an affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's session was described by Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson as ``extraordinary'' and ``emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The president had a strong message for us,'' Richardson said,
``and that was that we should press ahead with the business of the
country.''

&HT;        STARR REPORT: NOW PLAYING AT A KINKO'S NEAR YOU
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Elliot Zaret  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Sept. 10 -- Trying to find a way to get copies of
the 500-page Starr report to as many as 7,000 clamoring members of
the Washington press corp, the House went to a well-known place:
Kinko's.
</P>
<P>
   The House Press Gallery forged a ``handshake agreement'' with
the California-based copying giant Thursday, in which Kinko's will
get one of the first released copies of the report in exchange for
handling the printing for the Washington media.
</P>
<P>
   Kinko's will limit distribution to accredited Hill reporters,
giving out only one copy to anyone with an official press badge. Of
course, ``when demand slows, additional copies will be made to the
public,'' according to a Kinko's memorandum. The cost for the
report: $.07 per page -- or $37.01, tax included.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Gallegos, superintendent of the House Press Gallery, said
they chose to go with Kinko's after deciding the Government
Printing Office just couldn't handle the demand. The GPO's first
order of business will be to print the report for the 435 members
of Congress, and that may be all the official federal printing
facility can handle on Friday, Gallegos said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has copies of this or access to it until the clerk's
gavel falls,'' said Gallegos. ``The first batch goes to members of
Congress. If (the GPO) makes 100 copies of the report per hour,
then it's four-and-a-half hours before all of Congress gets it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more to it than just taking a bunch of papers and
xeroxing it,'' Gallegos added.
</P>
<P>
   But that's exactly what Kinko's intends to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can make 500,000 copies a day out of this branch,'' said
Andrew Widman, general manager of the Kinko's at 1402 New York
Ave., which lies halfway between the White House and the National
Press Building. ``It's still under lock and key and armed guard as
far as I know, but we should get it within minutes (of it being
released).''
</P>
<P>
   After that, it's off to the races for the copy shop.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time the House has turned to Kinko's for
help. When the report on Newt Gingrich's ethics investigation was
released in early 1997, Gallegos had the copy giant print the
report for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tied up every Kinko's in Washington,'' said Gallegos. ``And
I had to put everything on my personal credit card. So I wasn't
anxious to do that this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, reporters will pay Kinko's directly and then get their
number in line.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with the ``vultures in the press has been a trying
experience,'' Widman said. Widman described the media as
``persistent and competitive,'' saying he received numerous calls
from reporters asking how they can get an early copy.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far I've not been offered a bribe,'' Widman said.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for the document, which is expected to reveal explicit
details about the President's relationship with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky, may be the highest in history for a federal
document.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be maybe the most publicly demanded document,'' said
Gallegos, who has worked at the Press Gallery for more than 20
years and remembers the high demand for the Watergate documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watergate, Iran-Contra were all in big demand -- it's hard to
make the comparison,'' Gallegos said. ``The public will be more
actively involved in this. And there's a certain amount of prurient
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   The report will be available on at least four sites on the
internet as well, Gallegos said, including
 &QL; http://thomas.loc.gov/ICreport &QR; ,  &QL; http://www.house.gov/icreport &QR; ,
 &QL; http://www.access.gpo.gov/congress/icreport &QR; , and
 &QL; http://www.house.gov/judiciary/icreport.htm &QR; .
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that won't solve all the demand problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of websites that will be available, but
because they're Internet sites, we expect them to crash,'' said
Gallegos.
</P>
<P>
   As for Kinko's, the company is thrilled to be part of the news
story of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're part of the fabric of America,'' said Kinko's founder
and chairman Paul Orfalea. ``We are to the eyes what the telephone
company is to the ears.''

THEY'RE JUST THE RIGHT MIX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A curious, beguiling diversion is mixed doubles,
often referred to as mixed troubles, and indulged in by married
couples only if they are very brave or foolhardy.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, mixed is unique in sport: a chance for women to
play a team game with and against men, to show their stuff in the
line of fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mixed was always my favorite, ahead of singles,'' said Billie
Jean King, who won 12 major singles titles and 11 mixed. ``There
was nothing like testing yourself against the hardest-hitting
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, she was the champion of mixed singles, too. King is
currently accepting silver anniversary congratulations from patrons
at Flushing Meadow, in the hilarious memory of her 1973 victory
over Bobby Riggs at Houston's Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   It was the night she put down His Piggishness, the outrageously
amusing Riggs, as a record tennis crowd (30,472), along with TV
millions, gaped and made women across the planet feel good about
themselves in the unending world war of the sexes. Who cared that
the schlocky chauvinist, ex-Wimbledon champ Riggs, outnumbered her,
55-29, in age? Mother Freedom King came out of it looking like Joan
of Arc with a skillet-shaped sword.
</P>
<P>
   Aussie Owen Davidson was a prime beneficiary of hers as he
racked a mixed doubles Grand Slam in 1967, winning three of the
four major titles with her at his side. ``When Billie wanted a
ball, I moved out of the way,'' he said with a grin. ``Nobody ever
intimidated her.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other Aussies, Margaret Smith Court and Ken Fletcher, had
etched the first mixed Slam four years before that, but it was not
until Thursday at the US Open that a singular doubles feat was
achieved by bead-rattling Serena Williams and serve-rattling Max
Mirnyi, a US-Belarus coalition.
</P>
<P>
   By beating Americans Lisa Raymond and Patrick Galbraith (the
1996 champs), 6-2, 6-2, Serena and Max not only took the US title
but completed a brand new tennis category: a Sisterly Slam.
</P>
<P>
   The Sisters Sledgehammer _ Serena and Venus _ thus swept the
four major titles and gave the remarkable Williams clan a pedestal
of their own. Venus could embellish it by beating Lindsay Davenport
in the women's singles semifinals this afternoon and going on to
the title that eluded her in last year's final against Martina
Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   This odyssey of the swift family Williams began in January as
Venus seized the Australian mixed with lanky American Justin
Gimelstob. They repeated in Paris, winning the French by beating
Serena and Argentine Luis Lobo, the only time sisters have clashed
for a major doubles title.
</P>
<P>
   But that was the end of Venus's mixed success. Serena took over
at Wimbledon because an amateur matchmaker named Nikolai Mirnyi, a
former college professor in Minsk, interceded on behalf of his
large, diffident 21-year-old son, Max.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to play with Lobo again,'' sighed Serena, ``but he
didn't want to play on grass. Mr. Mirnyi came to me and asked if
I'd play with Max. I sort of knew Max when we both practiced at
Nick Bollettieri's place in Bradenton (Fla.), so I said OK.''
</P>
<P>
   They won over Mirjana Lucic and Mahesh Bhupathi and decided to
reunite at the Meadow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was too shy to ask her,'' said bulky, genial 6-foot-4-inch
Max, the Minsk doubles ace now living with his family in Sarasota,
Fla. ``Now she has carried me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, Max carried me,'' Serena insisted. ``Venus and I, we're
pretty happy to have a family Slam.''
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, Mirnyi, struggling in singles, now has more major
titles _ the two mixed _ than wins on the ATP Tour, where his
record is 1-5. Theirs is an odd coupling when you consider their
singles status: she No. 20, he No. 246. But it works.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll take the trophy and I'll take the money,'' giggled
17-year-old Serena. ``No, no, no. Really, we'll split it.'' His
end, $60,000, could buy half of Belarus, but the Mirnyis are
content in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   A brief rift didn't break them up in London. ``Serena stood me
up for the Wimbledon ball,'' he blushed, ``but ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a misunderstanding,'' she finished the sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Such tennis unions are slippery business. ``What do we have in
common? Well, tennis, and reggae,'' said Serena. ``We both like Bob
Marley.''

SPORTS COLUMN: OF SLUGGERS AND SCROOGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a plague in the land, and it's spreading. Scrooges are
jumping out of the bushes, kicking Tiny Tim's crutches out from
under him. In this case, the crutches are the bats of Mark McGwire
and Sammy Sosa, and the Scrooges are people who are already
belittling their prodigious feats.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's record and Sosa's role as McGwire's rabbit in the race
for the record are being questioned by critics who suggest either
(1) home runs have become cheaper or (2) the McGwire and Sosa
exhibitions aren't baseball as it was intended to be.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the critics are in the news media, others are in
baseball-related pursuits and still others are fans who air their
views to anyone who will listen, especially other talk-show
listeners.
</P>
<P>
   When their criticisms are dissected, it appears that their real
complaint is that baseball isn't what it used to be, whatever that
was. And that the fact that McGwire has been able to break the
record of Roger Maris, who broke the record of Babe Ruth, means
home runs aren't what they used to be.
</P>
<P>
   The critics apparently lament the disappearance of the days when
players were smaller and weaker, ball parks were bigger and the
major leagues had 144 pitchers instead of 344. We could return,
too, to the days when games could be heard on radio only (through
the re-creation of ticker-tape information) and could not be seen
throughout the country on cable or satellite television.
</P>
<P>
   We have electricity, indoor plumbing and automatic ice makers.
Times change. So do sports. Eras come and eras go. This era in all
sports is different from previous eras. Games are more wide open.
That's what fans approaching the next millennium want.
</P>
<P>
   If baseball fans, purists excluded, of course, want home runs
and higher-scoring games, baseball is only too happy to provide
them. If car-buyers wanted nothing but cars with three wheels,
General Motors would stop manufacturing Pontiacs and Buicks as we
know them.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' Rey Ordonez and the Cubs' Lance Johnson (no home runs
in a combined 675 at-bats going into Thursday night's games) have
not joined McGwire in breaking the record. Home runs are not even
being hit at a more frequent pace than last year. One critic in the
news media said home runs have become so diluted that a dozen
players will hit 50 or more this season. Who are they?
</P>
<P>
   Ten players have 40 home runs or more now. Half have yet to
reach 45. Fifteen or so games remain. How many of those players
will hit enough home runs to reach 50? Not enough to get anywhere
near a dozen.
</P>
<P>
   The other complaint deals with the game itself. Larry Gerlach, a
University of Utah history professor and current president of the
Society for American Baseball Research, was quoted the other day as
comparing the McGwire-Sosa record chase to a slam-dunk contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's attracting people is not what baseball is all about,''
Gerlach was quoted as saying. ``I don't sense that people are that
much more interested in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the McGwire-Sosa chase has attracted nonfans to the game,
some of them might find a reason to stick around and see a game or
two, in person or on television. Baseball will take the revenue and
the ratings, and it should feel no shame for doing it. Owners and
players are in the sport to make money. That endeavor has not
become a sin.
</P>
<P>
   Gerlach also was quoted as saying the pursuit of Maris' record
lacked the intensity and drama that Maris' pursuit of Ruth's record
had because they were chasing a number and not a god, as Maris was.
``There was a lot of feeling out there that the record shouldn't be
broken at all,'' Gerlach said of Maris' quest. ``With McGwire,
nobody gives a damn.''
</P>
<P>
   Quite to the contrary, fans in Pittsburgh, Miami, Cincinnati and
all other cities that McGwire and Sosa visited fervently cared.
They wanted one or both to break the record. And if the man from
that baseball research group believes this season's quest lacked
intensity and drama he should have been in St. Louis the past week.
The fans and the players there might have redefined the meanings of
those words.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another voice was heard from last week in the effort to
belittle the record chase. The National Football League, which
jealousy guards its wager-generated popularity, had its operatives
whispering the word that despite the purported interest in the Mark
and Sammy Show, all of its league's season openers, for the first
time, were sold out far enough in advance for all of the games to
be televised locally.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the question those NFL operatives should address is why
did it take the league 25 years since the blackout policy was
adopted to finally achieve this milestone.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if anyone thinks McGwire's record is tainted by his use
of androstenedione, listen to Tracy Stallard, the pitcher who gave
up Maris' 61st:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see them give that stuff to pitchers,'' Stallard
said, ``and see how many home runs they hit.''

 WASHINGTON: United States.

   The senators warned him that his presidency depended on his
honesty now. ``People gave very frank assessments, making clear
that the situation could not be sustained if there were further
revelations or if you cannot contradict aspects of the report,''
Torricelli said.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli said that Clinton began the meeting by discussing the
pain he had caused his family and his effort to ease it. He said
that Clinton believed ``they'd have a stronger relationship having
survived this crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   After the talk, Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority
leader, invoked the terminology of modern popular psychology in
calling for national healing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that this process will continue with an expectation
that we can bring it to closure some time in the not-too-distant
future,'' Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of the scope of Clinton's political problems
that he feels compelled to address them directly and repeatedly. In
past controversies over matters like his campaign finances, Clinton
preferred to ignore any accusations in the belief that the public
was more interested in his agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used that approach in the months after the Lewinsky
accusations surfaced, and tried it again even after acknowledging
an intimate relationship with her on Aug. 17. But since then, the
congressional Democrats whom Clinton needs to sustain him against
possible impeachment hearings have begun to back away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a real change in his approach to these problems in
the last few weeks,'' Torricelli said. ``He's gone from being angry
at his accusers to being angry at himself, and there's a marked
transformation, and you can see it in his manners and in his
face.''
</P>
<P>
   White House aides said that the president surprised them by
abandoning his previous, grudging apologies, over the objections of
some hard-line advisers. These aides insisted that his new approach
did not mark a strategic shift. ``He's just going in and doing
it,'' one Clinton aide said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Another one said that Clinton's family, friends and Democratic
colleagues ``have forced him to confront the magnitude of the harm
that he has done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is, he's saying it because he feels it,'' this
adviser said. ``If he didn't feel it, he wouldn't say it, as we
know from the last couple of weeks.'' He compared Clinton's
transformation to a person's passage through four stages of dealing
with a death, saying he had moved from denial, to anger, to
acceptance and a desire to get on with his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said that they expected Clinton to continue apologizing
publicly at future events, such as at a prayer breakfast at the
White House on Friday morning. Senate Democrats urged him to do so
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton has become more aggressive in his contrition, his
aides are struggling to devise a defense for him on Capitol Hill.
Two close advisers to the president said that they are still
searching for an ``uberlawyer'' to serve in a senior White House
staff position who could coordinate the work of Clinton's lawyers
and the White House political staff, and act as a trusted
ambassador to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The ideal candidate, former Democratic Majority Leader George
Mitchell, is not thought to be interested, said Democratic
advisers.

 Adobe Escapes the Red, Ekes Out Quarterly Profit   By Benny Evangelista  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Adobe Systems Inc., the target of a takeover bid by a rival desktop
software-maker, yesterday posted a slim third-quarter net profit
and revealed that its recently completed workforce cuts were deeper
than expected.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But analysts were encouraged that Adobe's warning that it might
slip into the red did not come true.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little better than they had preannounced and a little
bit better than people had feared,'' said analyst John Rossi of
BancAmerica Robertson Stephens. ``Adobe had a disaster on its hands
a few weeks ago, but it appears to have taken fast measures to
repair things.''
</P>
<P>
   Adobe posted net income of $152,000 (1 cent per share) on
revenues of $222.9 million for the third quarter that ended August
28. That compared to net income of $41 million (55 cents) on
revenue of $230 million for the third quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Adobe was particularly stung by the economic downturn in Japan,
one of its prime markets. Sales were $35.1 million for the quarter
in Japan, a $25.2 million decline from the third quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The maker of desktop publishing software cut about 350
employees, or 12 percent of its workforce, in a major restructuring
designed to save about $60 million a year. Adobe took a one-time
$37.1 million restructuring charge for the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Adobe last month said 250 to 300 employees, or about 10 percent
of its workforce, would lose their jobs, but found the cuts would
be deeper once the company discontinued some sales units, said
spokeswoman Linda White.
</P>
<P>
   About 19 percent of the layoffs were in senior management as
Adobe streamlined its decision-making organization to give more
direct operational control to founders John Warnock and Charles
Geschke.
</P>
<P>
   Rossi said the better-than-expected earnings report could help
boost Adobe's stock price, which has sagged about 31 percent this
year, and put the company in better position to fend off an
unsolicited bid by rival Quark Inc. of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Adobe spurned the bid by privately held Quark, which has not
revealed a specific offer. Quark executives insist they will pursue
the acquisition, which some Adobe watchers discount as a publicity
stunt by Quark.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings report was released after the close of the market.
Adobe closed at $26.81, down $1.19.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Hany Nada of Piper Jaffray Inc. was still skeptical that
Adobe has turned the corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all watching with a very leery eye,'' said Nada, who
maintained a neutral rating on Adobe's stock.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE FIRE INSIDE OF CLEMENS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By IRA BERKOW    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the Toronto scoreboard before the game against Detroit on
June 3, the starting pitchers were listed along with their season
records. For the Blue Jays, it read, ``Roger Clemens, 5 wins 6
losses, 3.50 earned run average.''
</P>
<P>
   He stared at that information and then turned to a companion.
``That's embarrassing,'' he said. ``I'm tired of this. That's not
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The man saying this was standing in the bullpen with a ball in
his hand. The man was Roger Clemens. The game before he had lost to
Cleveland. But that night, disgusted with his performance for the
early part of this season, Clemens turned over a new leaf as few
have done before. He beat the Tigers, 5-1. And he continued to win,
conquering Baltimore, Montreal, the Mets, Detroit again, the
Yankees, the White Sox, Texas, Minnesota, Seattle, Kansas City, the
Twins again and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   He has won 13 straight games, the longest winning streak of the
season. His 18 victories are just one behind the major league
leader, David Cone, with 19.
</P>
<P>
   And Friday night, against the Yankees, Clemens goes for yet
another victory, with the hopes of his team riding on his powerful
right arm as they challenge the Red Sox for the wild-card entry _
they were four and a half games out with 17 to go Thursday night _
in the American League playoffs. He is doing this at age 36 and in
his 15th year in the major leagues _ a time when many pitchers who
have thrown as hard as he does are rocking in chairs on faraway
porches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one word to use with Roger Clemens,'' said Joe Torre, the
Yankee manager, ``is the one word you used with Bob Gibson, and
that is `war.' When people thought it was over for him early in the
season, he hasn't done anything wrong since May.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point this season, Clemens pitched three consecutive
shutouts. He leads the league in earned run average at 2.62; in
opponents' batting average against, at .192; and he is tied with
Pedro Martinez of Boston in strikeouts, with 227. He hasn't allowed
a home run in 85 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember one game against the Twins,'' said Mel Queen, the
Blue Jays' pitching coach, ``when we had an early 3-0 lead and he
allowed them to get back in the game by giving up two runs in an
inning. He came into the dugout mad as he could be at himself. He
went into the tunnel leading to the clubhouse and started screaming
at himself, `If you don't want to win it bad enough _ get outta
there!' He shut them out the rest of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Some batters see what they call ``a fire'' in Clemens' eyes when
he is on the mound. ``You know you're in for a battle,'' said
Darryl Strawberry, the current Yankee and former Met, who hit
against Clemens as far back as the 1986 World Series. ``You see it
in his eyes. You know the fire comes from down inside. It's
pride.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Plesac, a Toronto reliever, remembered a game earlier this
season when Milwaukee got men on first and third with nobody out in
the seventh, with Toronto ahead by 2-0. ``You could tell, just from
the way Roger stood on the mound, that he was disturbed,'' Plesac
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He struck out the side on 10 pitches. He has the talent to go
into a higher gear at crunch time like Joe Montana in football and
Michael Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Koufax once said: ``I was given the ability to throw the
ball harder than most people. Something in my arm is built a little
different.''
</P>
<P>
   But to be a great pitcher, Koufax would surely agree, it takes
more. Koufax learned to throw with a plan in the second half of his
career, and that made all the difference. Clemens, whose stern work
ethic has kept him robust, still throws the ball 95 miles an hour,
but also in places he knows hitters don't wish to go. He led the
league in victories early, in his first two seasons in the big
leagues, with the Red Sox, and then _ after a handful of just fair
seasons _ did it again last year.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, his emotion, typified as a kind of dragon in
cleats, was made clear in the three-year contract Clemens signed as
a free agent with Toronto before the 1997 season. There is a
provision in it that if the Blue Jays seek to ``rebuild'' in his
time, he can opt out of it. He wants to play for a contender. In
July, when the Blue Jays indeed sold or traded several of their
important players, Clemens sought a trade. It didn't materialize.
So Clemens did something about it: he virtually carried the Blue
Jays from a rag-tag early season into a chase for the wild-card
spot.
</P>
<P>
   McQueen has a phrase for Clemens: ``Pitcher perfect.'' Has a
ring to it. &QL;

 It's Not A Grape Year   By Peter Sinton  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Grape expectations are not so great this year.
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a record 1997 harvest that had consumers cheering about a
possible wine glut and declining prices, this year's crop could be
20 percent below normal, or even worse.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of record rains, California's grape crop is not only
sparse, it's coming in three to four weeks later than usual. The
harvest won't be completed until Halloween or early November and
that scares growers because late crops are more likely to get hit
by rain and rot.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there should be enough wine to meet consumer
demand. Last year's California harvest, which was about a third
larger than the previous three-year average, provides some
reserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think California producers will hold prices to take care of
consumers and keep them from fleeing to foreign brands.'' said
Beverages &AMP; More wine buyer Wilfred Wong. ``There's still a lot of
competition from Australia, Chile, France and elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   But it won't be a very profitable year for grape growers and
some vintners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a rough growing season,'' said Dawnine Dyer, wine maker
for Domaine Chandon in Yountville, Napa County. ``Grape cluster
size is small. With all the storms, the bloom was late and the
berries didn't set well.''
</P>
<P>
   That was only the first of the problems. Grapes took longer than
usual to grow in the cool early summer. Some growers responded by
trimming leaves so more nutrients could flow straight to the fruit.
But then the mercury topped 110 degrees in an August &LR;   &LR; heat wave
and some grape clusters got sunburned.
</P>
<P>
   Dyer figures that the crop will be 20 percent smaller than the
five-year average and 40 percent below last year's record, when
California produced about 2.9 million tons. That doesn't help
Domaine Chandon and other California producers of sparkling wine
gear up production as the biggest New Year's celebration in a
millennium approaches.
</P>
<P>
   This year, many growers are harvesting six to seven tons of
grapes per acre compared to nine or 10 tons from the same vines in
1997, according to Barry Bedwell, president of Allied Grape
Growers, which represents about 600 growers.
</P>
<P>
   Although production per acre may be off 30 percent on average,
Bedwell figures the total California crop will be down only about
20 percent because about 30,000 acres of vineyards planted in the
past few years are now bearing fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Not all growers or regions have fared the same. The North coast
regions of Napa and Sonoma seem particularly hard hit. The Central
Valley also has suffered and thunder showers in the past week have
not helped. But the central coast region from Monterey to Santa
Barbara is doing relatively well, with normal production levels.
</P>
<P>
   Growers and analysts are hedging their predictions because the
harvest is barely 15 percent complete, compared to close to 50
percent at this point last year.
</P>
<P>
   While quantity is down, quality could be fine. But Bedwell notes
that because of the adverse weather, a lot of grapes have thin
skins this year. That make them more susceptible to breaking down
and rotting, especially if the weather gets wet. Add in a scarce
labor supply and you have an uncommonly complex harvest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Predictions of a wine glut have evaporated,'' said Wine
Institute President John DeLuca.
</P>
<P>
   About the only good news for growers is that they won't have
storage problems this year. Wine industry economist Jon Fredrikson
figures that California's wine grape crop could be down as much as
40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers, though, could be spared because wine is a global
commodity.
</P>
<P>
   In the first six months of this year, imports from France,
Chile, Italy and other countries dropped to 5.4 million gallons
from 10.2 million in the same period last year. That spigot could
be opened again.
</P>
<P>
   ``France has some of its own weather problems,'' said David
Freed, chairman of UCC Vineyards Group in Napa. ``But the pipeline
is there.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, California's wine acreage has expanded 30 percent
from 332,000 acres to 432,000 acres since 1991, according to
Fredrikson. However, wine consumption over the same period has
jumped 38 percent to 44 million cases.
</P>
<P>
   At the retail counter, prices have been stable and in some cases
have drifted down. The cost of 1.5-liter jugs of merlot and
chardonnay have come down about $1 in the past year to the $6 to $9
level.
</P>
<P>
   Prices of premium Kendall-Jackson, Mondavi Coastal and
Beringer's Meridian labels have dropped 10 percent to 20 percent to
well below $10.

SOWARD LEARNS TOUGH LESSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ R. Jay Soward remembers the most painful part of
being suspended from USC's opening game against Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the media coverage. It wasn't the fact he would miss
his first football game of his life.
</P>
<P>
   It was the thought of facing his father, and explaining how he
had let his grades slip so much that new coach Paul Hackett decided
to suspend the talented wide receiver during spring practice _ and
withhold him from the Trojans' season opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to show my face at the house. I didn't go home
(for two months),'' Soward said. ``I didn't call home or
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Soward even asked Hackett to call his parents and explain the
embarrassing situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``My little brother said my dad was hurt,'' Soward said. ``My
dad never told me, but my little brother did.''
</P>
<P>
   As is customary with parent-child relationships, Soward's
father, Rodney, remembers it slightly differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was upset, but it was out of concern, not in a derogatory
manner,'' Rodney Soward said. ``We weren't mad at him. We felt all
the time that R. Jay would do what he had to do.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Rodney Soward was a little relieved that his son
was being disciplined. He had always been tough on R. Jay, even
though Rodney was just 16 when his son was born.
</P>
<P>
   But during Soward's first two years at USC, Rodney felt his son
had begun to stray, too caught up in the fast life afforded a star
college football player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always understood he needed to be pressed, and that
wasn't happening at USC. I wasn't happy about that,'' Rodney Soward
said. ``I had to press him harder than my other kids. I knew that
my son, to play to the best of his ability, needed a structured
environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't investigate that John Robinson wasn't a
disciplinarian. John Robinson is a good person, but it wasn't the
best situation for R. Jay. For an 18-year-old to be in that
environment and be set free caused some problems.''
</P>
<P>
   That all ended when Hackett took over. He told the players he
would make an example of anyone who faltered academically. When
Soward performed poorly, the coach didn't hesitate to suspend him
last March.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to make it clear that I mean what I say,'' Hackett said.
``He paid the penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Last May, Soward eventually returned home and was welcomed with
open arms by his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was so happy to see me. They were calling me a
stranger,'' Soward said.
</P>
<P>
   Life is finally back to normal for Soward this week, as he
prepares to make his debut in the Trojans' game against San Diego
State on Saturday night at the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   He believes the suspension has helped him mature. A lack of
maturity was a source of criticism from past coaches and teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son, other than with me _ and not always with me _ isn't
too submissive,'' Rodney Soward said. ``The change in maturity has
come, and I expected it to.''
</P>
<P>
   Soward's still full of enthusiasm, and can still talk with the
best of them. But Soward has learned that even he is not immune
from team rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never been punished like that,'' Soward said. ``That's
the hardest thing I've done in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Soward had a dream right before the Purdue game that Hackett
would change his mind and let his best receiver play. In the dream,
Hackett approached him in the locker room at halftime and said,
``R. Jay, get dressed.''
</P>
<P>
   That never happened.
</P>
<P>
   But Soward has never become despondent with his situation. He
compiled a 3.0 grade-point average in his summer classes and
remained the Trojans' swiftest and most-impressive receiver in
training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``His response to the situation has been sensational,'' Hackett
said. ``It was only a one-game suspension because of how
sensational he responded.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say Soward's bravado doesn't still surface from
time to time. He was thrown out of a practice after arguing with
wide receivers coach Mike Wilson. And he can still occasionally
irritate teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most importantly, though, Soward is learning to
compromise. He showed up for training camp wearing braids, a new
hairstyle he began growing since the suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, however, he cut away the braids after talking with
his father, who was concerned his son would gain a negative image
with the new look.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really didn't want to cut his hair,'' Rodney said. ``The
coaches wanted him to cut his hair, because people stereotype you.
The biggest thing I told him was you have to conform to society
because it's what is best for you.''
</P>
<P>
   So last week, Soward went back to his traditional shaved head.
</P>
<P>
   This week, he's back in the Trojans' starting lineup. Soward is
determined to catch a deep pass, or score a touchdown, and regain
his spot as the USC's big-play receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is back to normal. It's showtime,'' Soward said.
</P>
<P>
   And Rodney will be right there, watching from his seat at the
Coliseum, ready to support his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't sleep and I'm not even playing,'' he said.
</P>

VOLKSWAGEN TO CREATE $12 MILLION FUND FOR NAZI-ERA LABORERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Faced with a new lawsuit over the use of
slave labor during World War II, Volkswagen AG is to announce plans
on Friday to set up a fund of about $12 million to compensate
surviving workers. It will be overseen by Shimon Peres, the former
prime minister of Israel, according to people working with the
company.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes at a time when U.S. lawyers have filed
class-action suits over slave labor against Volkswagen and many
other German industrial companies. Most of the companies
acknowledge that they used slave laborers during Hitler's Third
Reich, but they say they were forced to do so by the government.
</P>
<P>
   It is considered unlikely that Volkswagen's decision will
persuade people to drop their class-action claims. A suit filed
last month proposed to recapture a share of each company's
accumulated profits that can be attributed to slave labor. If the
suit against the companies is successful, it would mean
compensation in the billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen, along with most other German companies, continues to
deny any legal responsibility for its actions during the Hitler
years.
</P>
<P>
   But Volkswagen announced nearly two months ago that it would
create a compensation fund.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, survivors' groups had not filed their lawsuit
against Volkswagen but were threatening to do so. Hoping to put the
conflict and bad publicity behind them, Volkswagen executives
abruptly reversed their policy and acknowledged a ``moral
responsibility'' to survivors of slave work.
</P>
<P>
   The new plan will be announced at Volkswagen headquarters in
Wolfsburg after a meeting of the company's supervisory board,
according to those familiar with the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives warned that they did not want to be pinned
down to precise numbers on the size of the new fund. But they
estimate that between 1,000 and 2,000 forced laborers are still
alive and that a fund of $12 million will be enough to provide
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   The total would work out to an average payout of about $12,000
or less for each survivor.
</P>
<P>
   But the most dramatic revelation on Friday will be the role of
Peres, who presided over much of the peace talks with Palestinians
before being defeated in 1996 by Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Peres, according to a person who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, will head an independent board that will evaluate all
the claims and decide how much to pay each survivor. Volkswagen
officials are calling the new board a curatorium.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Many, if not all, of the other board members have yet to be
chosen, and company officials plan to make sure that none of the
board members are Volkswagen executives.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure on Volkswagen and the other German companies that
are being sued has increased since Switzerland's three biggest
banks reached a $1.25 billion settlement with Jewish organizations
last month over money and gold that belonged to Holocaust victims
and was never returned.
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of slave labor, a group of lawyers in New York and
Munich has sued all the German car manufacturers, including BMW and
Daimler-Benz; electronic companies, including Siemens; steel
companies, including Krupp, and chemical companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will not get Volkswagen off the hook in a legal sense,''
said Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal
Center, a Jewish rights organization in Los Angeles that was active
in lawsuits against Swiss banks and has been watching the slave
labor issue closely. ``But if in fact they go ahead with this
agreement, it is an important step because it will put pressure on
the BMWs and all the other companies to stop hiding behind legal
objections.''
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen is expected to announce that the curatorium board
will be able to decide how much compensation each survivor of
forced labor will receive and how it should be dispersed. The
company is also expected to say that payments to survivors could
begin before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The plan will almost certainly not end the widening arguments
over compensation for forced labor. Other German companies, like
Daimler-Benz, have proposed setting up a large pool of money for
survivors to which companies and the German government would
contribute.
</P>
<P>
   But Chancellor Helmut Kohl rejected that proposal last month,
arguing that Germany had already paid out more than $60 billion to
Jewish causes and to Israel since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen officials are expected to contribute to a broader
compensation fund if German companies ever reach an agreement with
the government.

 Globalstar Stock Crashes With Rocket   By Dan Fost  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
In an embarrassing, expensive debacle for a San Jose
telecommunications company, a rocket carrying 12 of its satellites
crashed to earth Wednesday while unwitting company officials
celebrated what they thought was a successful launch with
employees, analysts and a reporter.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Globalstar officials say the Russians running the launch kept
them in the dark while the rocket carrying $180 million worth of
satellites smashed to smithereens somewhere in southern Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials did not learn of the disaster for at least two
hours, and did not make it public until early yesterday.
Globalstar's stock plunged nearly 40 percent on the news yesterday,
falling $7.13 to $10.75 per share.
</P>
<P>
   The rocket was launched at 1:29 p.m. Pacific Standard Time
Wednesday from a site in the former Soviet Republic of Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   Globalstar workers and invited guests watched the launch from
company headquarters on television monitors. In a simulated
newscast, a faux anchorwoman in a red blazer narrated the action.
Employees cheered and executives sighed with relief as she reported
a ``gorgeous launch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything could not be better at this point,'' said
Globalstar engineer Joe Killian, reporting from a bunker under the
Baikonur Cosmodrome, a launch facility formerly used for Soviet
rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Unbeknownst to Killian, things by then had gone dreadfully
wrong. The rocket, which cost as much as $100 million, had
developed two major computer faults about 41/2 minutes after the
launch.
</P>
<P>
   Killian had been relying on a team of Russian engineers for
information. But when the problems developed, the engineers were
diverted and Killian was forced to rely on a Russian interpreter
reading from a prepared script of how the launch was  &LR; supposed &LR;  to
proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the newscast, which was also broadcast live over the
Web, showed a map of the rocket's progress across the globe.
(Despite the crash, the broadcast was continually replayed all day
yesterday on www.globalstar.com.)
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and others happily watched the show, munching on a
catered lunch of chicken stuffed with sun-dried tomatoes while they
talked about the bright future of satellite phone services.
</P>
<P>
   Globalstar ultimately plans to launch 52 low-orbiting satellites
that are intended to provide wireless phone service all over the
planet.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts who attended the launch celebration could not believe
the news when they woke up yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was floored,'' said Maya B. Tse, an analyst with Frost and
Sullivan in Mountain View. ``Why it is that they didn't know or
didn't seem to know?''
</P>
<P>
   Another analyst, Greg Howard of Infonetics in San Jose, said
``It reminds me of a Clancy book coverup.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said it bore an uncanny resemblance to the 1978 movie
Capricorn One, about a faked manned mission to Mars.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with analysts yesterday, Globalstar chief
executive Bernard Schwartz explained: ``There was a misconnect
between the Baikonur personnel that were giving us the information.
... They did not adjust their reporting immediately to reflect the
fact that there was an accident. It was a low-level error on the
part of the people reporting to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The launch was to have represented both a victory over the Cold
War past and a bold step toward a new world of satellite telephone
service.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. defense contractor Loral Space and Communications owns
42 percent of Globalstar, and had contracted with the former
Ukrainian defense contractor Yuzhnoye to build the rocket. The
Russian government still controls the Baikonur Cosmodrome, and was
responsible for the launch.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these years, we were developing, designing and
manufacturing ballistic rockets for intercontinental flights which
could carry nuclear warheads,'' Yuri Smetanin, the chief design
engineer of the Zenit rocket, said yesterday before the launch.
</P>
<P>
   Smetanin was said to have collapsed after he heard the news, but
was on medication and feeling better yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Globalstar does not plan to use any more Yuzhnoye rockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that's for certain: This doesn't spell well for the
commercialization of the rocket factory in (Ukraine),'' said
Howard. ``It's certainly a major setback.''
</P>
<P>
   No company had ever tried to launch 12 satellites on a single
rocket before. The satellites are the size of two 55-gallon drums,
with 16-foot solar arrays spread out like wings from the center.
</P>
<P>
   Globalstar officials said, and analysts agreed, that yesterday's
failure would not present a major setback in Globalstar's plans to
build a constellation of satellites that could ultimately supplant
cellular telephones.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Loral, San Diego-based Qualcomm is a key investor
in Globalstar. Ten other companies, including San Francisco-based
AirTouch Communications, own stakes in Globalstar.
</P>
<P>
   The rocket failure follows several other similar events. A
Boeing Delta III rocket carrying a PanAm Sat satellite exploded on
launch at Cape Canaveral August 26. And on August 12, a classified
Air Force Titan 4A rocket exploded, also at Cape Canaveral.

YANKEES SOUGHT EXTENSION ON KNOBLAUCH CONTRACT  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Yankees considered extending the contract of
Chuck Knoblauch at the time they traded for the second baseman in
February, and according to a member of the organization, they
tentatively reached an understanding to give Knoblauch a two-year,
$18 million extension, beyond the three years and $18 million that
still remain on his current contract. That extension would not be
announced until after the Yankees finish their season.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Cashman, the Yankees general manager, Thursday declined to
answer directly the question of whether there is a two-year, $18
million understanding in place. ``We have nothing done with Chuck
Knoblauch that's official now,'' Cashman said. ``We haven't talked
to his agents for a long time. We certainly would like to keep him,
and we'll talk once the season is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch agreed to a five-year, $30 million contract with the
Minnesota Twins in November 1996 and, with the Twins floundering in
1997, he asked for a trade. The Yankees gave up minor leaguers,
including a top pitching prospect, Eric Milton, and $3 million to
acquire Knoblauch in February.
</P>
<P>
   Because Knoblauch was traded in the middle of a multiyear
contract, he has the right to demand a trade at the end of this
season. Knoblauch would presumably waive that one-time-only right
in exchange for an extension.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees and Knoblauch's agents, Randy and Alan Hendricks,
discussed the extension either just before the completion of the
February trade (which would have required the blessing of the
Twins) or just after; publicly, both parties maintained at the time
that there were no ongoing discussions and would not be until after
the season.
</P>
<P>
   If the Yankees follow through with the two-year extension, they
would be obligated to pay Knoblauch $36 million over the next five
seasons, through 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Relative to the first seven seasons in his major league career,
Knoblauch has had a subpar year: he had a .304 career average with
the Twins, and he was hitting .260 with the Yankees going into
Thursday night's game. He averaged nearly 40 steals per season in
his first seven years, and he has 27 this year. His defense
suffered in the first half of the year, and Knoblauch said that
perhaps he was pressing early.
</P>
<P>
   Some scouts also feel Knoblauch is a better player on artificial
surface _ the Twins' home surface _ than on grass. Last year, he
batted .269 on grass, and .307 on turf. This year, however, he has
turned that around, batting .270 on grass and .214 on turf.
</P>
<P>
   And over all, Knoblauch has been a steady, patient leadoff
hitter this season with solid run production, ranking among the top
three American League hitters all year in pitches per plate
appearances. He also ranks fifth in the American League in runs
scored, with 106. In addition, Knoblauch has slugged a career-high
17 home runs and has 60 runs batted in, and his defense has
improved markedly in the second half of the year _ he had 10 errors
before the All-Star Game break, and has only 3 since.
</P>
<P>
   A $9 million annual salary would be the highest the Yankees have
ever paid out, surpassing the $8.25 million they are currently
paying Bernie Williams, who will seek a deal in excess of $10
million per year when he becomes a free agent after this season.
Knoblauch would be 35 years old in the season that the two-year
extension would expire.

   WASHINGTON _ As Congress today prepared to cast its first
procedural vote on what could lead to articles of impeachment
against President Clinton, members of Georgia's delegation said
they were beginning to feel the full weight of the historic months
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   All 13 Georgians could play a role in the process. House members
may be called on to decide whether to impeach the president, and
Sens. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.) and Max Cleland (D-Ga.) could be
called on to actually vote on whether he should be removed from
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every member of Congress should constrain conjecture because
we are all now part of the adjudication, the judicial resolution of
these matters,'' Coverdell said Thursday. ``We should be, as a
juror, governed by the knowledge that we are potentially a part of
the resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Some members will have more extensive roles to play, both
formally and informally. Rep. John Linder (R-Ga.) sits on the
powerful House Rules Committee, which sets the terms of debate on
resolutions that reach the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the Rules Committee passed a resolution that, if
approved by the full House, will make public the report by
independent counsel Kenneth Starr, releasing some 435 pages of
executive summary and findings to members of Congress and the
American people.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), of course, will play a
decisive role throughout the proceedings. On Thursday, Gingrich
sought to set the tone, warning members on the House floor to
refrain from ``personally offensive criticism'' of the president
and his conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.) sits on the Judiciary Committee that will
actually sift through the more than 2,000 pages of evidence,
transcripts and audiotapes to determine if the House should proceed
with an impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Barr, one of Clinton's harshest critics, said his role will be
to evaluate Starr's evidence, examine what constitutes impeachment
and ``see if we have a match.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), the delegation's senior Democrat and a
friend of Clinton's, will have no formal role in Judiciary
Committee proceedings, but Lewis already has established himself as
one of Clinton's most loyal backers, repeatedly urging voters to
forgive the president's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to pick him up one more time,'' Lewis said Thursday.
``We can't go along with hatred. We have to learn to forgive.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all Democrats are following so ardently. Rep. Sanford Bishop
(D-Ga.), who represents a conservative South Georgia district and
faces a potentially difficult re-election contest, said he is
reserving judgment until he has read Starr's report.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have enough information to make an informed judgment,
and I don't know that it is appropriate to do it at this point,
since we in the House will be sitting almost as a grand jury. It's
inappropriate to form a conclusion without hearing the facts
first.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking their cues from Gingrich, Georgia Republicans toned down
some of their criticism of the president. Rep. Jack Kingston
(R-Ga.) said he thought the president's recent declarations of
apology were ``sincere.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But unfortunately, it's at the point where it's a judicial
proceeding,'' Kingston said. ``Often people go to court and they
are accused of something and they are certainly sorry about it. But
that doesn't mean they are off the hook, either. Right now, we have
to be very careful and go through this process very slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 20 years, I'll be gone and long forgotten and will still
have to live with this vote,'' he continued. ``You get big votes
... but this is one that makes all those pale.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like impeachment,'' said Rep. Charlie Norwood (R-Ga.).
``It's not good for the country. I'm very concerned about this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone said yesterday that short of declaring war this is one
of our most important constitutional duties, I agree with that,''
he said. ``This is a sacred process. I want us to be very careful
fooling with that sacred process.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one Georgian, Linder, was willing to predict that
Congress would never reach impeachment proceedings, saying the
president will resign before the election.
</P>
<P>
   Linder said polls showing that honesty and integrity have risen
to the top of voters' concerns indicate that Clinton's problems are
having a devastating effect on Democrats' electoral chances this
fall. ``He's killing them,'' Linder said.

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Investors, already shaken by a long list of worries,
began fretting Thursday that a possible impeachment could derail
the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, investors took out their frustration on stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell as much as 345 points
before finishing 249.48 points lower at 7,615.54.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks' decline Thursday, combined with Wednesday's 155-point
loss, more than wiped out the record 380 points that the Dow gained
on Tuesday amid hopes that the Federal Reserve Board may intervene
in the battle against economic distress spreading around the world
by lowering U.S. interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said U.S. political instability, sparked by an
investigation into President Clinton's affair with intern Monica
Lewinsky and heaped upon worries about a worldwide recession and
lower U.S. corporate earnings, became too much for investors to
take.
</P>
<P>
   ``Markets cannot live with a wounded president facing the risk
of impeachment for months and months to come,'' said David Hale,
chief economist at Scudder Kemper Investments in Chicago. ``If the
stock market falls (drastically), you depress consumer confidence
and spending. It's a negative, but it's hard to quantify yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress is expected to release on Friday details of independent
counsel Kenneth Starr's report on Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's office said the report contains ``substantial and
credible'' evidence of possible impeachable offenses by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The swirling scandal around Clinton undermines confidence in his
ability to continue leading the nation and aggravates investors
already panicked about a global economic crisis, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just another piece, but it's not good,'' said Hugh
Johnson, market strategist at First Albany in Albany, N.Y., an
investment firm. ``He's distracted, and there are some important
decisions that need to be made that may help stabilize the
situation in other parts of the globe.''
</P>
<P>
   While Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has a more direct
impact on the economy because he can move financial markets with a
few opaque words, Clinton has presided over a period of record
economic prosperity, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``From an economic standpoint, people associate the last four or
five years with economic progress with this president's
administration, whether the seeds were planted in previous
administrations or not,'' said Les Fox, a money manager at the
investment firm Dain Rauscher in Houston. ``When things are going
well, any change in the status quo is likely to give people cause
for concern.''
</P>
<P>
   The shaky position of the leader of the world's most powerful
nation adds to investors' uncertainty, which spells trouble for
stocks, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's market swoon was the fifth time in 10 sessions that
the Dow has whipsawed more than 300 points in a day, including the
512-point plunge on Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   That plunge took the Dow more than 1,700 points, or 18.4
percent, below the July 17 record of 9,337.97.
</P>
<P>
   Among other leading market measures, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
fell 26.01 to 980.19, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite
index fell 39.22 to 1,585.33.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-1 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume came to a
blistering 1.032 billion shares, up sharply from Wednesday's tally
of 919.69 million.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the timing of Starr's report comes as corporations
are about to enter the so-called confessional period when they warn
about earnings shortfalls for the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate earnings are expected to disappoint investors.
</P>
<P>
   A consensus of analysts' earnings estimates call for
third-quarter earnings of companies comprising Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index to grow only 0.8 percent over the year-ago period,
according to First Call in Boston, which tracks earnings estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The threat to Clinton's political survival has been hardest on
foreign investors, who have fled to U.S. investments to escape
economic turmoil in Asia and Russia and other less-developed
markets, market observers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes us look inept,'' Johnson said. ``Clearly, (Clinton's)
not going to be taken as seriously as he once was.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investors have been key supporters of U.S. investments,
said Ed Larsen, chief equity officer at Aim Capital Management in
Houston, a mutual fund company.
</P>
<P>
   They shoveled $65 billion into the U.S. stock market last year,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In this year's first quarter, foreign investors poured in money
at an annual rate of more than $100 billion, Larsen said.
</P>
<P>
   But their worries about the United States has hurt the U.S.
dollar, which ``has made a major change in its behavior'' in the
past month, Larsen said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the dollar fell as markets dropped worldwide under
the added weight of Clinton's escalating problems, coupled with the
ongoing financial crises that appear to be spreading to Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are close to saying, ``there's no place to hide in the
rest of the world,'' Larsen said.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar dropped to a 16-month low against the German mark
during the turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   In late New York trading, the dollar was worth 134.23 yen, down
from 137.00 yen late Wednesday. The U.S. currency also declined to
1.6843 marks, down from 1.7215. During trading, the dollar dropped
to a level last seen in late May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, the ruble rose for a second day, after the government
announced changes to customs taxes and rules on foreign exchange to
shore up the currency.
</P>
<P>
   Fears that the economic turmoil hitting Russia and other
emerging markets will spread to Latin America have stung currencies
in that region.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican peso dropped sharply to a historic low for the sixth
consecutive session, despite the Bank of Mexico's intervention in
foreign-exchange markets to bolster its currency for the first time
since December 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very simple: The world or global financial crisis
continues, but it's getting worse, not better,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The gyrations in global financial markets have been good news
for alternative investments.
</P>
<P>
   Bond prices surged Thursday, pushing long-term yields to a new
low, as investors poured money into government-backed securities
for safety.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury market also was buoyed by speculation that the
Federal Reserve will cut interest rates to prevent financial
turmoil in Russia, Asia and other emerging economies from stifling
the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 1 3/32
points, or $10.94 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves
in the opposite direction, fell to 5.20 percent from 5.27 percent.
The yield was the lowest since the government began issuing the
bond on a regular basis in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Gold climbed more than 2 percent, its biggest gain in almost
eight months, as investors sought refuge from declines in stocks
and the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar's fall boosted gold because gold is priced in
dollars, and a falling U.S. currency makes gold less expensive for
foreign investors.

UCLA SIGNS RICH SHOE DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Using leverage it may never have again _ as the
Pac-10's only non-Nike school _ UCLA last month signed a major
all-sport contract with Adidas athletic shoes worth $19 million
over six years, according to public documents obtained Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the Bruins' expiring Reebok deal paid $4.35
million over six years.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA is the fifth school to sign with Adidas, following
Nebraska, Notre Dame, Tennessee and Northwestern.
</P>
<P>
   While the deal doesn't approach Michigan's contract with Nike _
reportedly worth $5.7 million per year _ it dwarfs reported Nike
deals with Colorado ($5.3 million over four years) and Arizona ($7
million over five).
</P>
<P>
   The UCLA-Adidas relationship officially begins July 1. It will
pay the Bruins $11.15 million in cash and provide $7.8 million in
equipment and apparel. Additional services, ticket purchases and
educational opportunities total approximately $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   The cash influx will offset standard operating expenses and help
finance the multi-million-dollar Morgan Center renovation,
according to athletic director Peter Dalis. It's a front-loaded
deal, paying UCLA $3.025 million in cash the first year and $1.625
each of the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Nike's proposal was slightly more lucrative, Dalis said, but it
failed to meet several corporate-level requirements.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Adidas agreed to place two full-time employees on
campus and provide seven student internships per year.
</P>
<P>
   First-timers: Several Bruins will make their first college
appearances Saturday against Texas, including:
</P>
<P>
   Redshirt freshman Freddie Mitchell and tight end Bryan Fletcher.
Mitchell is a big-play receiver who doubles as the No. 1 punt
returner.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa Community College transfer Randy Hakes, a reserve tight
end, and Glendale College transfer James Ghezzi, the No. 3
offensive tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Four true freshmen: tailback DeShaun Foster, linebacker Robert
Thomas, receiver Jon Dubravac and nose guard Ken Kocher. Thomas has
a broken hand and Kocher a sprained ankle, but both are expected to
contribute.
</P>
<P>
   Ready to go: Junior Durell Price is a first-time starter at
fullback after beginning his career at tailback. He replaces Craig
Walendy, who has not practiced because of an allergic reaction to
bug bites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Durell realizes his opportunities are better as a fullback,
here and quite possibly at the next level,'' coach Bob Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Safety valve? Junior Eric Whitfield won the starting free safety
job over redshirt freshman Jason Stephens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason will see some playing time, but it was so close we felt
the experience factor outweighed everything else,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas update: The Longhorns' offensive line has four senior
starters and averages 310 pounds. By contrast, UCLA's heaviest
defensive lineman is Kocher, who weighs 292.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as big as any (NFL) offensive line,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   The man running behind the line is All-American tailback Ricky
Williams.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Everybody needs a mentor, and Michael Schwab found
his on a hot July day in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab was the only Jewish kid in all of the Jamaica Estates
section of Queens, N.Y., not attending sleep-away camp. He needed
something to do that summer, so he wandered down to the baseball
field at Jamaica High School, a few blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   There was a little old man named Joe Austin, showing the Erins
and the Leprechauns and the Blarney Girls _ all his teams from St.
Monica Roman Catholic Church _ the intricacies of the bunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``My team was the Shannons,'' recalled Schwab, now the Superior
Court Justice for Yakima County, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   The judge flew across the country to attend the funeral Friday
of his mentor, Joseph Austin, who died on Tuesday at the age of 94.
</P>
<P>
   A few people get rich from sports, and then there are the Joe
Austins, the local heroes who spend their own modest paychecks to
supply bats and balls and uniforms so kids can play a game for fun.
</P>
<P>
   For six decades, Austin was groundskeeper and coach and drill
sergeant and role model for thousands of kids, including a future
governor of New York state, whose name was either Glendie LaDuke or
Matt Denty or Lava (``always hot'') Labretta or Mario Cuomo,
depending on which school or team he was representing at the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   Austin was an equal-opportunity Pied Piper. Boys and girls,
blacks and whites, Protestants and Jews, all had their place on the
baseball and basketball teams at St. Monica, in a working-class
section of South Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe took us to Madison Square Garden, Coney Island, Jones
Beach,'' Schwab recalled the other day.
</P>
<P>
   And a few more exotic locales, as well. Joe's world included
Bradley's Cafe on 164th Street, a loud foul away from the baseball
fields at Jamaica High on 84th Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was preparing for my bar mitzvah when I was 12,'' Schwab
said this week. ``I came home one day and told my parents how I had
just learned to read the Racing Form at Bradley's Cafe with my
teammates from St. Monica's. My father and mother said, `This is
our bar mitzvah boy?'''
</P>
<P>
   Austin, who never married, who lived with several of his
sisters, was a night manager at Piels Brewery, known for its
advertising campaign of Bert and Harry Piel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before every game, the Shannons would kneel together and
everybody else would recite the Hail Mary,'' Schwab recalled.
``Each of us had to pray out loud to his patron saint. They would
get to me and I would say, `St. Bert and St. Harry, pray for me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their denomination, the St. Monica players understood
that Austin's strength came from his religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would see him at the early mass on Sunday, standing in the
back in his khaki pants and white T-shirt, still clean at that time
of the morning,'' Cuomo said. ``We got the message. He never
delivered homilies to us on sin and conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   After mass, Austin would rush out to bail any rain puddles and
to try to restore a rudimentary pitching mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always wore his steel-tipped shoes from work,'' Schwab
recalled. ``He never wore sneakers or spikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin had his own gruff code of ethics. Cuomo recalls that only
four members of the elite older team, the Celtics, showed up for a
basketball game one night. Austin could not make it, either, but
Cuomo, going by Matt Denty on this occasion, persuaded the referees
to let the Celtics take the court with only four players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Our other people are coming, maybe their car broke
down, let us start,''' Cuomo said.
</P>
<P>
   The glib orator also shamed the opponents into not employing a
``hanger'' at their basket with the extra man.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next day the headline in the Long Island Press said,
`Celtics Beat Baisley Park Civics, 53-51, With Only Four Players;
Matty Denty Scores 13.'''
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo assumed Austin would be proud of the valiant band of four.
Instead: ``The next day, Joe said, `Don't ever do that again. That
was a disgrace, playing four men.' Joe was a purist. You always
played the game by its rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe's rules had a hard edge to them. A personal note: I can
recall our neighborhood team, the Hollis Warriors, being imported
as cannon fodder into the St. Monica gym on Sundays, to be drubbed
by one of Austin's teams. My body can still feel the brutal shock
of being run into several of the concrete pillars in the low-roofed
basement. With a chuckle, Cuomo admits that Joe Austin taught them
how to run that play.
</P>
<P>
   Generation after generation of Joe's players moved on to
college, to work, to public service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody once asked Joe, `Did you ever produce any
major-leaguers?''' Schwab said. ``Joe answered: `I've produced a
lot of cops and firefighters and businessmen. They're major
leaguers in my eyes.'''
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo, who did play minor-league baseball before becoming a
lawyer, recalled how Austin seemed to work with little communal
support.
</P>
<P>
   ``They finally named a park for him, but that was only because
one of his boys got to be governor,'' Cuomo said of the Joseph V.
Austin Park, just west of Jamaica High.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo also recalled his first inauguration, looking out and
seeing the aging Leprechauns and Erins and Celtics, and then seeing
his old coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked out and I saw Joe rap his left hand into his right
palm, the old signal to hit away,'' Cuomo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stopped and returned the signal, and I saw all the other
guys giving the signal, and nobody else in the audience knew what
was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   At subsequent state functions, Cuomo would make sure Austin was
invited, ``although it was tough to get him out of Queens.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo proudly watched Austin received an honorary degree from
Queens College in 1983, and every summer the old ball players would
return to Jamaica to honor Austin, who coached until the last year
or two.
</P>
<P>
   The former governor is committed to a speech somewhere else and
cannot attend the funeral Friday at Our Lady of Victory R.C. Church
in Floral Park. But Schwab flew in from Yakima, and many of the
other old boys and girls will be there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe never had kids,'' said the judge who once prayed to St.
Bert and St. Harry. ``But you know about large Irish families?
We're all his kids.''

   WASHINGTON _ As Congress prepared on Thursday to make public the
445-page impeachment report by the Whitewater independent counsel,
Democrats and Republicans began testily jockeying over the details
of disclosing materials that could imperil the Clinton presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Despite repeated references to bipartisanship by leaders of both
parties, feuding erupted as Republicans rebuffed efforts by
Democrats to win even one hour in advance of the report's release
for the president and his lawyers to review it.
</P>
<P>
   Later on Thursday night the Republican-controlled House Rules
Committee voted to send the full House a resolution that would
allow immediate dissemination of the report by the independent
counsel, Kenneth Starr, into the president's extramarital
relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The House was expected to easily pass the measure on Friday, a
vote that will pave the way for the release within hours of a
report, that no member of Congress has yet seen, with no effort at
prior scrutiny or editing of any of the graphic details of
Clinton's liaison with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The report's swift disclosure _ by way of the Internet _
promises the nation an extraordinary cyberspace look at the
narrative that prosecutors say provides ``substantial and
credible'' evidence that could warrant Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats were fuming at its hasty release. Rep. John
Conyers Jr., the senior Democrat on the Judiciary Committee,
protested the report's posting on the Web to the Rules Committee:
``The House of Representatives is not the U.S. postal service. We
are not a delivery system for Kenneth W. Starr. We cannot, we ought
not, we should not, release anything to anybody unless we know what
it is we're releasing.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the Judiciary Committee chairman, Henry Hyde, told the
Rules Committee that ``it is important that we American people
learn the facts.'' He said he thought that Starr's report could be
released without prior scrutiny but said the committee would take
time to examine another still-sealed 2,000 pages of backup material
and boxes of grand jury testimony and videotapes also sent to
Congress. Those are to be put under the jurisdiction of the
Judiciary Committee for review, to be released publicly on Sept.
28, unless the committee decided to hold them back or edit
information.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions ran high in the House _ particularly among Democrats _
as it faced the possibility of impeachment proceedings for the
first time since 1974, when President Richard Nixon resigned
because of the Watergate scandal.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the pressures felt by Democrats worrying about
whether the scandal engulfing Clinton will affect their prospects
in elections just two months away, Democratic leaders said that
they expected many party members to vote for disclosure of Starr's
report on Friday despite their qualms. A fraction of Democrats as
well were among the voices calling for swift disclosure, hoping to
get the worst behind them as quickly as possible.

HOUSE PROCEEDS TOWARD RELEASE OF STARR REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY AND BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House of Representatives, rebuffing President
Clinton's request to preview the evidence against him, plans to
publicly release the independent counsel's report Friday, with its
raft of allegations that threaten the Clinton presidency with a
crisis of unknown and untold proportions.
</P>
<P>
   With the report and its voluminous supporting evidence stashed
away in a secure room under police guard, somber House Republicans
Thursday hammered out an agreement for distributing the report to
members and the news media Friday afternoon and posting the same
documents on the Internet. As of Thursday, not a single House
member had been allowed to read the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very grave day in the House of Representatives,
indeed, a solemn time in our nation,'' said Representative Gerald
Solomon of New York, the Republican chairman of the House Rules
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The decision for a rapid public release was reached despite
claims of unfairness by the White House and leading Democrats, who
repeatedly argued that President Clinton's lawyers should be given
two or three days to preview the report to compose a response to
its myriad allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nobody who defends the president's actions,'' said
Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the highest ranking
Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, which would consider
bringing articles of impeachment against Clinton. ``The question
is, is he going to get a fair process.''
</P>
<P>
   While details of the report remained out of the public domain
for one final day, the scope of the allegations became somewhat
more clear. The report will contain accusations that Clinton twice
lied under oath about the nature of his sexual relationship with
Monica S. Lewinsky, first in his deposition last January in the
Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit and most recently in his Aug.
17 grand jury appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The report will also include allegations that Clinton tampered
with witnesses, specifically his White House secretary, Betty
Currie, as well as obstructed justice and abused the power of his
office, according to news accounts. One key meeting in question:
Clinton's Sunday morning discussion with Currie last January, the
day after he returned from the Jones deposition and faced his first
questions about his relationship with Lewinsky, a former White
House intern less than half his age.
</P>
<P>
   The report is also expected to address whether he misused his
office and obstructed justice in trying to locate a new job for
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Clinton summoned 10 key Democratic senators
to the residence, and later his Cabinet, for another offering of
contrition in his three-week campaign of penance. Both meetings
became emotional, according to a White House official, and at least
once Clinton questioned his ability to survive the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   At another point, one of the senators asked if the Starr report
would contain any more surprises or damaging information. ``His
answer was that, no, there were no surprises,'' said Senate
Democratic leader Tom Daschle, speaking to reporters on the White
House driveway.
</P>
<P>
   It was an answer that few Democrats appeared ready to easily
accept. All around the capital, from the offices of the West Wing
to the chambers of Congress, the anxiety over the report was almost
palpable. The common expectation was that the report would contain
damaging and even devastating revelations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not making any judgment until I read the full report,''
said Massachusetts Senator John F. Kerry, in a telephone interview
Thursday afternoon. ``I want to read the report and then I will
make a judgment of one kind or another.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska: When Clinton says, ```Do
you trust me?' No, I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meeting, Clinton explicitly apologized to the senators,
many of whom he had told in January that he did not have a sexual
relationship with Lewinsky. Many of those senators, in turn,
publicly defended him and are privately infuriated.
</P>
<P>
   ``He explained that he had lied to each of us because he was
personally embarrassed and concerned for the consequences for his
family,'' said Senator Robert Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle added of Clinton: ``It's fair to say we all accept his
apology, and we need to go on from here.''
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday night, Clinton met with his Cabinet for the first
time since January, when he promised the secretaries that the
allegations were false and several strode to the White House
driveway to express to reporters their belief in him.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman told reporters of
the ``great sense of metamorphosis'' that Clinton is undergoing,
from .
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, lawmakers seemed to labor under the weight of
history Thursday, acting on what House Speaker Newt Gingrich
described as ``one of the most difficult things any member of the
House will deal with in their entire career.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats separately met behind closed doors in
the morning, and on the floor of the House, Gingrich warned the
membership not to personally attack Clinton or use provocative
language.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday afternoon, White House Counsel Charles Ruff, Clinton's
personal attorney David Kendall and deputy White House chief of
staff John Podesta journeyed to Capitol Hill to seek a preview of
the report from key House leaders and to be briefed on the
proceedings. For the second day in a row, Kendall lashed back at
the contents of the report, though he has not yet read it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is simply a collection of their contentions, claims and
allegations, and we look forward to the opportunity to rebut
them,'' Kendall said on the Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, Democrats argued at every turn for a delay
in the public release to allow a White House review of the
documents. The arguments, however, fell on the deaf ears of
Republicans, who said there was no precedent in Watergate or the
Iran-Contra investigation for such special and early access.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats, among them Representative J. Joseph Moakley of
Massachuseetts, the ranking Democrat on the Rules Committee,
pointed out that House rules grant members who are accused of
ethics violations to review the allegations 10 days before they are
made public. Gingrich received such a preview nearly two years ago
when he faced ethics charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's only fair that we give President Clinton the same
opportunity we would give ourselves,'' Moakley said.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Martin Meehan, the Massachusetts Democrat, said
in a telephone interview: This report represents the prosecutors'
perspective, and we have a responsibility to let the president be
heard with any evidence he has.''
</P>
<P>
   By early Thursday night, members of the Rules Committee, by a
voice vote that appeared follow party lines, took the first crucial
step toward allowing the public release of the Starr report. At the
same time, they also referred the Starr investigation to the House
Judiciary Committee in what represents the first step toward a
possible impeachment proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   The full House is expected to vote on releasing the documents
Friday, following two hours of debate scheduled to begin shortly
after 10 a.m. Gingrich said the public release will probably occur
between 2 and 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   While the 445-page report, summary and findings will be made
public, the 2,000 pages of supporting indices, grand jury testimony
and other evidence will be restricted. House Judiciary Committee
Chairman Henry Hyde of Illinois and Conyers, the ranking Democrat,
asked Repulican leaders to grant only the two of them access so
they could review the material and decide, within the next 10 days,
what should be made public.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders initially agreed, but they relented under pressure
from rank-and-file House members who also wanted access to the
material. They ruled that the material would be made available to
all 35 members of the Judiciary Committee, prompting Conyers and
others to accuse the Republican leadership of dealing in bad faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we start this process with a broken promise,'' Conyers told
Solomon, ``I can tell you, quite frankly...'' He stopped short of
completing his sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it ironic that we treated Richard Nixon more fairly
than we treated this president, and we are at the beginning of the
process,'' said Representative William Delahunt, the Quincy
Democrat and former county prosecutor who serves on the Judiciary
Committee. ``For the public to have confidence in the process, it
must be truly bipartisan. This is a poor beginning.''

 WASHINGTON: as possible. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the first time since they returned from a summer recess,
House Democrats met behind closed doors on Thursday morning, with
party leaders trying to assure them that they were not facing a
rout at the polls in November and that they had to focus attention
on their strengths, like their positions on Social Security,
education, and an overhaul of regulation of health maintenance
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   However, Dick Gephardt, the House minority leader, emphasized to
his party's members, that the president's standing in the polls
should not affect any decision on whether to move ahead with
impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Several Democrats said he told them that if the president had a
100 percent poll rating but evidence indicated that he had
committed an impeachable offense he should face the judgment of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   As the public learns the details of Starr's report over the
weekend, the Democratic reaction will be crucial for Clinton. The
House caucus was divided between those who were angrily protesting
that Clinton was not being allowed to see the accusations against
him and those who focused on what is expected to come in the
report.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Moran, D-Va., said some in the caucus said the
president's survival should be a priority. He said that he
disagreed. ``The Democrats are in minority and this is a train
heading downhill without a brake on it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Accusing White House aides of being too focused on trying to
beat the charges against the president, Moran said: ``It's not a
matter of beating charges. It's a matter of restoring the moral
authority of the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   But other Democrats protested the Republicans' refusal to give
Clinton an early look at Starr's report, noting that when House
Speaker Newt Gingrich was censured by the House on ethics charges,
he was allowed to review the report against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave Gingrich a week to look at it and respond to it,''
said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and a member of the Judiciary
Committee. ``The president is asking for two days. The Republicans
say no.''
</P>
<P>
   At midday, Clinton's private lawyer, David Kendall, along with
Charles Ruff, the White House counsel, and John Podesta, the White
House deputy chief of staff, came to Capitol Hill for a meeting
with Hyde. Both sides called the session cordial. But a Judiciary
Committee aides, who insisted on anonymity, said that Hyde opposed
their request for 48 hours to review the report before its release
and then refused to give them even an hour in advance.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For much of the day Republicans and Democrats looked for legal
precedents to bolster their arguments about how to proceed in a
situation without precedent. Never before has a report accusing the
president of impeachable offenses come before Congress under the
20-year-old law authorizing independent counsels.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, in an appearance on CNN, said that a review of a
special prosecutor's report before its release had ``never been
done before. It was never done during Watergate, never done in
Iran-Contra.'' He said he would allow Clinton's lawyer to post the
president's response to Starr's report on a House Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in the interview whether Clinton should resign, the
speaker said, ``I think only the president can answer that. He
knows in his heart what the facts are.''

WHITMAN, STUMPING IN WEST, INSISTS SHE'S HAPPY AT HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mont., Nev., Ariz., N.M., Calif., Hawaii)  (bl) 
 By JENNIFER PRESTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman is not asked the
question very much these days at home. But here in California,
where she is trying to help Republican candidates raise money and
broaden their appeal to women and swing voters, the question about
her own aspirations gets asked at every campaign stop.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's aides smile almost wistfully, as if remembering a
heady time long ago, when someone asks whether Whitman might run
for national office. She gives the same answer she has given since
her celebrated tax cuts first pushed her onto the national stage in
1994: ``I am very happy being the governor of the state of New
Jersey. I love it.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since her narrow re-election victory last
fall, Whitman is back in the national political spotlight this
week, with an eight-day campaign swing for fellow Republicans in
five Western states and Hawaii. And even though she insists that
she has no political ambitions beyond New Jersey, she admits that
it has been nice to be encouraged to seek higher office and to be
warmly greeted here after last year's punishing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   After she was nearly defeated by a little-known Democrat, Jim
McGreevey, the mayor of Woodbridge, N.J., some political analysts
predicted that Whitman would quietly disappear from the national
political landscape. At the same time, she was heavily criticized
by some prominent conservative Republican leaders for refusing to
go along with the state Legislature's ban on a procedure that
opponents call ``partial-birth abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   But none of that seemed to matter much to Republicans here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to seeing her go on to bigger and higher
places,'' said Haydee Tillotson, 59, of Huntington Beach, after
Whitman spoke at a luncheon in conservative Orange County on
Wednesday. ``She is a lady who has accomplished a lot. She has
proven to be capable. And some of the extremists of the Republican
Party need to realize that we need to reach out to all members of
the party and that we cannot be about one issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Zukin, a pollster and a professor at Rutgers University's
Eagleton Institute of Politics, said: ``She has always been more
popular outside the state that in it. When she won election in
1993, it was a vote against Jim Florio. It was not a vote for
Christie Whitman. It is not that they don't like her. They have
always been just pretty lukewarm on her.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite giving a speech on foreign policy at the Richard Nixon
Library and Birthplace in Yorba Linda and making an appearance on
the television talk show ``Politically Incorrect,'' both on
Wednesday, Whitman insists that her intention is not to build her
own political standing. She said that, in addition to raising money
and making appearances with Republican candidates, her most
important mission was to deliver the message that Republicans need
to band together to recapture the White House in 2000. She said the
party needed to move away from divisive social issues like abortion
and rally around what she described as its core principles: family,
fiscal conservatism and public accountability.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must continue to focus on these major Republican goals as
we head into the midterm elections,'' she said in a speech to a
Republican club in Orange County. ``These are the issues we should
be taking to the voters. These are the core issues that will frame
the future of Republican government. These issues will help us win
elections.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Whitman acknowledged that many of the Republican
candidates whom she has been trying to help during her campaign
swing through Montana, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico and California
do not share her views on abortion rights. ``I have no problem with
it at all,'' she said Thursday during a breakfast with local
reporters. ``That is not why they are running for office. That is
not their main theme.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Republican Party struggles over strategies for capturing
the White House in two years, Whitman said, there might be some
valuable lessons to learn from the Republican candidates seeking
the two top offices here in California.
</P>
<P>
   State Treasurer Matt Fong, a Republican who is challenging Sen.
Barbara Boxer, a Democrat, opposes abortion after the first
trimester. State Attorney General Dan Lungren, the Republican
gubernatorial nominee, opposes abortion rights. Yet both Fong and
Lungren have been careful not to emphasize their positions on
abortion or other politically charged social issues in their
campaigns. They also appealed to Whitman for help in reaching women
and swing voters. Almost two-thirds of California's electorate
supports abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren, who has been widely praised by conservative Republicans
for his views on social issues, including abortion, said he
recognized the need for Republicans to line up on the same side on
issues like taxes, the size of government, law enforcement and
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had situations,'' Lungren said Wednesday night at a
fund-raiser here that Whitman attended, ``when we spend so much
time fighting among ourselves that after our intrasquad scrimmage,
we were so bruised that we couldn't play the game. We ought to
learn from that. We've elected a guy named Bill Clinton twice to
the White House. In many ways, we have allowed that to happen
because we were concentrating on divisions among us, rather than
all the strengths that we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman, who told one group of California Republicans after
another about the importance of their state's November elections to
set the party up for the presidential race in 2000, also drew
applause when she mentioned at several appearances that she was
outraged by President Clinton's admission of an improper
relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think perhaps the most offensive thing to me, besides his
personal behavior, is he has admitted going before the nation and
lying to people,'' she said. ``You don't raise your children saying
it's all right to lie today because you said you're sorry tomorrow.
He needs to seriously reevaluate his approach to life.''
</P>
<P>
   But she stopped short of calling for Clinton's resignation or
impeachment. ``Resignation clearly rests with the president,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   After campaigning with Lungren, Whitman is scheduled to go to
Hawaii to help Linda Lingle, a Republican gubernatorial candidate.
Then it is back to New Jersey, where few people urge her these days
to seek higher public office. Next week, the question in New Jersey
is likely to be about property taxes, since Whitman is expected to
release the recommendations of a gubernatorial commission to help
bring down property taxes in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see a decent, normal woman run for president,
like Governor Whitman,'' said Denise Quigley, 56, of Irvine, Calif.
``She is one of us. Or maybe she would consider moving to
California to run for governor here.''  &QL;

MOYA REACHES SEMIS IN STRAIGHT-SET VICTORY OF LARSSON  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBIN FINN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Carlos Moya, the 1998 French Open champion, checked
his internal confidence meter two weeks ago and experienced a rude
awakening. It was empty. With the U.S. Open around the corner, he
estimated his chances of survival to be next to none, especially if
he let his thoughts wander to last year when he lost in the first
round.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old Majorcan was puzzled by his state of mind again
Thursday, but this time in a positive way. He reached the semifinal
round of the U.S. Open with a bravura 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 blitz of Magnus
Larsson of Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you tell me at the beginning of the week that I'm going to
be in semifinal, I would say you're crazy,'' said the 10th-seeded
Moya, the sole seeded player to emerge from the bottom half of the
draw. ``I thought I cannot beat anyone the way I was playing. My
confidence was below zero. But I won the French Open. I won Monte
Carlo. I'm in the semifinals. I don't have to be afraid of
anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Moya's game is not the run-and-gun style favored by classic
hardcourts swashbucklers like Patrick Rafter and the top-ranked
Pete Sampras. And while Moya admits that clay is his natural
surface, his opponents would be wise to remember that he is the
all-court acolyte.
</P>
<P>
   Moya dethroned Boris Becker, the 1996 Australian Open champion,
in the opening round in 1997. Late in 1996, Becker made the mistake
of telling the rangy Spaniard that he had the talent to compete as
well on hardcourts as his native red clay. Moya took the advice to
heart, and now, after coming into this event worried about
surviving the first round, he has revised his expectations and
hopes to become the first man since Mats Wilander to win the French
Open and the U.S. Open in the same year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I want to be like Wilander; he won them both like 10 years
ago,'' said Moya, whose math is as accurate as his play has been.
</P>
<P>
   The last Spanish man to reach the Open's semifinal round was
Manuel Orantes, who went on to win the 1975 title.
</P>
<P>
   Moya said it was his emotional second-round victory against
Michael Chang, a night-time comeback from a two-sets-to-none
deficit that took 3 hours 49 minutes and left the Spaniard on his
knees and close to tears when Chang finally capitulated, that
changed his attitude and his luck. That 3-6, 1-6, 7-6, 6-4, 6-3
resurrection marked the first time Moya had reversed such a dire
deficit and the first time he had dropped the first two sets of a
five-set match.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Moya vowed that if he could survive that, he could
survive anything. He got to put that fortitude to the test in the
next round, where Jan-Michael Gambill forced him to a fifth-set tie
breaker before backing off.
</P>
<P>
   The victory against Gambill, combined with the Chang marathon,
gave him consecutive victories in Grand Slam epics for the first
time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``My luck started to change in that match against Chang; after
there, I realized I'm doing better than I think,'' said Moya who
warded off three match points. ``Saving those few match points made
me trust more in myself. And with what happened against Gambill, it
gives you a lot of power. You think that nobody can beat you right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   The suddenly self-assertive Spaniard, whose brown tresses have
fully recovered from being shorn to the roots when he did his
mandatory stint in the Spanish army last summer, had never faced
Larsson, but he was not worried.
</P>
<P>
   Five rounds into this Open, it dawned on Moya that, with a Grand
Slam under his belt and a visit to a Grand Slam hardcourts finale
20 months ago, he was in charge of his destiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a better player right now,'' Moya said. ``I take more
risks than before, go more often to net. I'm serving better.''
</P>
<P>
   Moya was successful on 81 percent of his first service points
Thursday and 71 percent of his second service points. He served his
only ace at an appropriate juncture: match point of the 90-minute
no-contest. Larsson earned only one break point and left it
unconverted, while Moya exploited 4 of 9 break chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've started to play well in the right moment, which is this
tournament,'' Moya said.
</P>
<P>
   MATCH POINTS
</P>
<P>
   Serena Williams and Max Mirnyi, who won Wimbledon's mixed
doubles title on their first stint as partners, added the U.S. Open
crown to their collection Thursday with a 6-2, 6-2 defeat of Lisa
Raymond and Pat Galbraith. The title constituted a sweep of the
1998 mixed doubles events at Grand Slam events by the Williams
sisters: Venus Williams won the Australian Open and the French Open
with New Jersey's Justin Gimelstob; Serena and her clay-court
partner, Luis Lobo, were runners-up at the French Open.

FUJI BANK DENIES REPORT OF BIG LOSSES

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Fuji Bank said Thursday that it currently had no actual
losses from derivatives trading, denying recent rumors that it had
lost large sums of money.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors that the bank had incurred trading losses of up to $14
billion drove down the bank's share price on Wednesday and led the
bank to issue a denial. Thursday it said that the $14 billion
referred to its credit exposure and therefore to its theoretical
potential losses from derivatives, which are financial instruments
that create value from underlying securities.
</P>
<P>
   But it said that currently its actual losses from derivatives
trading were zero. In theory, it said in explaining another number
that was mentioned Wednesday, the maximum possible loss from
derivatives would be about $114 million, based on the probability
of default of its counterparties.
</P>
<P>
   The bank's shares gained 4 yen Thursday to close at 333 after
plunging 59 yen Wednesday. &QL;

   &UR; Barbie Turns 40 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's hard to believe, but in 1999 Barbie will turn 40, just
in time to greet the new century. And they've been 40 full, rich
years. She began as a glamorous airline stewardess when she was
introduced at Toy Fair in 1959. She soared into space as an
astronaut in 1974, ran for president in 1992, and, in 1997, she
bore disability bravely, folding her first-ever bending legs into a
wheelchair to become a role model once again for a newly identified
market.
</P>
<P>
   In every incarnation, nationality, and skin tone, she's
perfectly turned out, with accessories galore at her long slender
fingertips. She's Everywoman, she's the Cosmo Girl, she has it all.
So, what will Mattel think of next as the company meets the
challenge of Barbie turning 40?
</P>
<P>
   Why fight age? Why not capitalize on it in every way possible?
Here are some ideas Mattel might consider for a past 40 Barbie:
</P>
<P>
   Bifocals Barbie.. Comes with her own set of blended-lens fashion
frames in six wild colors (half-frames too!), neck chain and
large-print editions of Vogue and Martha Stewart Living.
</P>
<P>
   Hot Flash Barbie.. Press Barbie's bellybutton and watch her face
turn beet red while tiny drops of perspiration appear on her
forehead! With hand-held fan and tiny tissues.
</P>
<P>
   Facial Hair Barbie.. As Barbie's hormone levels shift, see her
whiskers grow! Available with teensy tweezers and magnifying
mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Cook's Arms Barbie.. Hide Barbie's droopy triceps with these
new, roomier-sleeved gowns. Good news on the tummy front, too:
muumuus are back! Cellulite cream and loofah sponge optional.
</P>
<P>
   Bunion Barbie. Years of disco dancing in stiletto heels have
definitely taken their toll on Barbie's dainty arched feet. Soothe
her sores with this pumice stone and plasters, then slip on soft
terry mules. Colors: pink, rose, blush.
</P>
<P>
   No More Wrinkles Barbie. Erase those pesky crow's-feet and lip
lines with a tube of Skin Sparkle-Spackle, from Barbie's own line
of exclusive age-blasting cosmetics.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer Mom Barbie.. All that experience as a cheerleader is
really paying off as Barbie dusts off her old high school megaphone
to root for Babs and Ken Jr. With minivan in robin's egg blue or
white, and cooler filled with doughnut holes and fruit punch.
</P>
<P>
   Midlife Crisis Barbie.. It's time to ditch Ken. Barbie needs a
change, and Bruce (her personal trainer) is just what the doctor
ordered, along with Prozac. They're hopping in her new red Miata
and heading for the Napa Valley to open a B&AMP;B. Comes with real tape
of `Breaking Up Is Hard to Do.`
</P>
<P>
   Single Mother Barbie.. There's not much time for primping
anymore! Ken's shacked up with the Swedish au pair in the Dream
House and Barbie's across town with Babs and Ken Jr. in a
fourth-floor walk-up. Barbie's selling off her old gowns and
accessories to raise rent money. Complete garage sale kit included.
</P>
<P>
   Recovery Barbie.. Too many parties have finally caught up with
the ultimate party girl. Now she does 12 steps instead of dance
steps! Clean and sober, she's going to meetings religiously. Comes
with little copy of The Big Book and six-pack of Diet Coke.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows when Barbie will have outlived her usefulness? From
Dream House to Nursing Home (both new and improved _
wheelchair-accessible and retrofitted to conform to ADA code
requirements), the possibilities (not to mention the accessories)
are endless.

<P>
   THERE'S a guy I pass by almost every day at an intersection who
holds a cardboard sign asking for work or money. Despite myself,
just the sight of him causes the same progression of reactions:
</P>
<P>
   Pity. Poor guy. Standing out there for hours, sometimes in the
rain, holding a cardboard sign. Down and out. Out and wet. Wet and
cold. Guilt. Passed by him again without sharing even a friendly
wave or a couple of bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Resentment. Who does he think he is? He's obviously not from
Hawaii. Why do people think they can just jump a plane here and
then expect the people of Hawaii to support them? Maybe someone
should tell him that he obviously can't afford to live in the most
expensive state in the union and should consider going home.
</P>
<P>
   Forgiveness. Hey, at least the weather's nice here. If I had to
be somewhere begging for a job, food or money, I'd pick Hawaii.
Even the rain's warm.
</P>
<P>
   Humor. For a panhandler, he's got some learning to do. Where he
stands, no cars can possibly stop. Is he begging-challenged? He
needs to be at one of those big, grassy shoulders where people have
enough time to consider his plight and pull over safely.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicion. I bet this guy makes a bundle. A thousand cars a day
go by. If just half of them give him a buck, he's making more than
I do. And he picks his own hours.
</P>
<P>
   Analytical. What if I were in his slippers? Would I wear
slippers? What if someone actually stopped and asked me do some
yard work for them? Shouldn't I at least be wearing tennis shoes?
Would I stand at that corner?
</P>
<P>
   Why not bring an umbrella? Wouldn't it make more sense to look
at the classified want ads to find a job? So, I imagined what it
would be like if I were out of a job tomorrow and had to go looking
for an entry-level job. I went to the classifieds. I was shocked to
see that there is no `Columnist Wanted` section. So I started
scanning the rest of the employment opportunities and began to
understand what that guy on the corner is up against.
</P>
<P>
   Out of all the ads in the paper, my search turned up these two
employment possibilities for someone with my qualifications:
newspaper delivery boy or exotic dancer.
</P>
<P>
   I'd have to say that of the two choices, the exotic dancer
position seems the best. I've done the newspaper delivery thing.
It's a young man's game. I'm not sure I could hoof it up and down
hills of Aiea Heights again and I doubt that they'd give a
44-year-old, entry-level newspaper delivery boy a 400-paper
condominium route.
</P>
<P>
   I like the exotic dancer classified ads because they each have
no fewer than six dollar signs and 11 exclamation points. ($$$CASH
TODAY!$!$!`, `WILL TRAIN!!!` and `!!!NO EXPERIENCE
NECESSARY!!!$$$.)
</P>
<P>
   You gotta love that enthusiasm. I suspect the newspapers would
get a lot more people applying for those delivery spots if they
threw more $$$$'s and !!!!'s into their ads. (!!!! Bust your hump!
$$$ Lugging tons of newspapers!!!$$$ Up really big hills!!!$$$$)
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt that if I got a job as a nude dancer it would
certainly be exotic. `Frightening` is another word that hops to
mind. `Shocking,` `alarming` and `cruel and unusual` serve as well.
</P>
<P>
   I probably could single-handedly stamp out the lap dancing
craze. `Stamp out` being the operational phrase. So, I don't know,
I guess the guy on the corner is doing the best he can to improve
his life. Traffic is his friend. The world is his cubicle. And he
gets to keep his clothes on. Next time I see him I'll have a new
reaction:

   &UR; Barbie Turns 40 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's hard to believe, but in 1999 Barbie will turn 40, just
in time to greet the new century. And they've been 40 full, rich
years. She began as a glamorous airline stewardess when she was
introduced at Toy Fair in 1959. She soared into space as an
astronaut in 1974, ran for president in 1992, and, in 1997, she
bore disability bravely, folding her first-ever bending legs into a
wheelchair to become a role model once again for a newly identified
market.
</P>
<P>
   In every incarnation, nationality, and skin tone, she's
perfectly turned out, with accessories galore at her long slender
fingertips. She's Everywoman, she's the Cosmo Girl, she has it all.
So, what will Mattel think of next as the company meets the
challenge of Barbie turning 40?
</P>
<P>
   Why fight age? Why not capitalize on it in every way possible?
Here are some ideas Mattel might consider for a past 40 Barbie:
</P>
<P>
   Bifocals Barbie.. Comes with her own set of blended-lens fashion
frames in six wild colors (half-frames too!), neck chain and
large-print editions of Vogue and Martha Stewart Living.
</P>
<P>
   Hot Flash Barbie.. Press Barbie's bellybutton and watch her face
turn beet red while tiny drops of perspiration appear on her
forehead! With hand-held fan and tiny tissues.
</P>
<P>
   Facial Hair Barbie.. As Barbie's hormone levels shift, see her
whiskers grow! Available with teensy tweezers and magnifying
mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Cook's Arms Barbie.. Hide Barbie's droopy triceps with these
new, roomier-sleeved gowns. Good news on the tummy front, too:
muumuus are back! Cellulite cream and loofah sponge optional.
</P>
<P>
   Bunion Barbie. Years of disco dancing in stiletto heels have
definitely taken their toll on Barbie's dainty arched feet. Soothe
her sores with this pumice stone and plasters, then slip on soft
terry mules. Colors: pink, rose, blush.
</P>
<P>
   No More Wrinkles Barbie. Erase those pesky crow's-feet and lip
lines with a tube of Skin Sparkle-Spackle, from Barbie's own line
of exclusive age-blasting cosmetics.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer Mom Barbie.. All that experience as a cheerleader is
really paying off as Barbie dusts off her old high school megaphone
to root for Babs and Ken Jr. With minivan in robin's egg blue or
white, and cooler filled with doughnut holes and fruit punch.
</P>
<P>
   Midlife Crisis Barbie.. It's time to ditch Ken. Barbie needs a
change, and Bruce (her personal trainer) is just what the doctor
ordered, along with Prozac. They're hopping in her new red Miata
and heading for the Napa Valley to open a B&AMP;B. Comes with real tape
of `Breaking Up Is Hard to Do.`
</P>
<P>
   Single Mother Barbie.. There's not much time for primping
anymore! Ken's shacked up with the Swedish au pair in the Dream
House and Barbie's across town with Babs and Ken Jr. in a
fourth-floor walk-up. Barbie's selling off her old gowns and
accessories to raise rent money. Complete garage sale kit included.
</P>
<P>
   Recovery Barbie.. Too many parties have finally caught up with
the ultimate party girl. Now she does 12 steps instead of dance
steps! Clean and sober, she's going to meetings religiously. Comes
with little copy of The Big Book and six-pack of Diet Coke.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows when Barbie will have outlived her usefulness? From
Dream House to Nursing Home (both new and improved _
wheelchair-accessible and retrofitted to conform to ADA code
requirements), the possibilities (not to mention the accessories)
are endless.

   &UR; Getting a (pan) handle on opportunity &LR;
</P>
<P>
   THERE'S a guy I pass by almost every day at an intersection who
holds a cardboard sign asking for work or money. Despite myself,
just the sight of him causes the same progression of reactions:
</P>
<P>
   Pity. Poor guy. Standing out there for hours, sometimes in the
rain, holding a cardboard sign. Down and out. Out and wet. Wet and
cold. Guilt. Passed by him again without sharing even a friendly
wave or a couple of bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Resentment. Who does he think he is? He's obviously not from
Hawaii. Why do people think they can just jump a plane here and
then expect the people of Hawaii to support them? Maybe someone
should tell him that he obviously can't afford to live in the most
expensive state in the union and should consider going home.
</P>
<P>
   Forgiveness. Hey, at least the weather's nice here. If I had to
be somewhere begging for a job, food or money, I'd pick Hawaii.
Even the rain's warm.
</P>
<P>
   Humor. For a panhandler, he's got some learning to do. Where he
stands, no cars can possibly stop. Is he begging-challenged? He
needs to be at one of those big, grassy shoulders where people have
enough time to consider his plight and pull over safely.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicion. I bet this guy makes a bundle. A thousand cars a day
go by. If just half of them give him a buck, he's making more than
I do. And he picks his own hours.
</P>
<P>
   Analytical. What if I were in his slippers? Would I wear
slippers? What if someone actually stopped and asked me do some
yard work for them? Shouldn't I at least be wearing tennis shoes?
Would I stand at that corner?
</P>
<P>
   Why not bring an umbrella? Wouldn't it make more sense to look
at the classified want ads to find a job? So, I imagined what it
would be like if I were out of a job tomorrow and had to go looking
for an entry-level job. I went to the classifieds. I was shocked to
see that there is no `Columnist Wanted` section. So I started
scanning the rest of the employment opportunities and began to
understand what that guy on the corner is up against.
</P>
<P>
   Out of all the ads in the paper, my search turned up these two
employment possibilities for someone with my qualifications:
newspaper delivery boy or exotic dancer.
</P>
<P>
   I'd have to say that of the two choices, the exotic dancer
position seems the best. I've done the newspaper delivery thing.
It's a young man's game. I'm not sure I could hoof it up and down
hills of Aiea Heights again and I doubt that they'd give a
44-year-old, entry-level newspaper delivery boy a 400-paper
condominium route.
</P>
<P>
   I like the exotic dancer classified ads because they each have
no fewer than six dollar signs and 11 exclamation points. ($$$CASH
TODAY!$!$!`, `WILL TRAIN!!!` and `!!!NO EXPERIENCE

</P>
<P>
   You gotta love that enthusiasm. I suspect the newspapers would
get a lot more people applying for those delivery spots if they

certainly be exotic. `Frightening` is another word that hops to
mind. `Shocking,` `alarming` and `cruel and unusual` serve as well.
</P>
<P>
   I probably could single-handedly stamp out the lap dancing
craze. `Stamp out` being the operational phrase. So, I don't know,
I guess the guy on the corner is doing the best he can to improve
his life. Traffic is his friend. The world is his cubicle. And he
gets to keep his clothes on. Next time I see him I'll have a new

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Denise F. Warren, who has spent the last 20 months as
director for marketing, planning and research in the New York Times
advertising department, will become vice president for advertising
sales, the newspaper announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The promotion gives Ms. Warren, 34, responsibility for
overseeing a variety of advertising categories _ including help
wanted, general classified, real estate and home furnishings
advertising _ which together account for roughly a third of the
newspaper's advertising revenue, said Nancy Nielsen, a spokeswoman
for The New York Times Co.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Warren joined the company in March 1988. After working as a
financial analyst in two departments and as a business manager for
group advertising sales at the company's women's magazine group,
Ms. Warren joined the newspaper in July 1994 as a project manager
in the strategic planning department. &QL;

unsuccessful effort to support the peso, which was pressured by new
panic selling in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   The Banco de Mexico's tough new measures, its first direct
intervention in the currency markets since 1995, could not prevent
the peso from dropping to a historic low of 9.49 U.S. cents.
Meanwhile, the bolsa, the Mexican stock market, plunged 9.82
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Agitating the Mexican markets were new declines on Wall Street
and mounting fears of a Brazilian currency devaluation, which could
greatly worsen the ongoing investor stampede out of emerging
markets that has resulted from the financial crises in Asia and
Russia, securities analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Jose Angel Gurria and the governor of the
central bank, Guillermo Ortiz, appeared at an evening news
conference, apparently orchestrated to calm the markets. Gurria
said Mexico's economy was healthy, but acknowledged that
international turmoil might worsen. ``We can't say what will happen
in Brazil tomorrow, much less next week,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The monetary measures announced Thursday are likely to lead to
further increases in Mexican interest rates, already above 45
percent, and aggravate fears among business people that the
country's booming economy could slide into recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mexican authorities are getting into some harsh monetary
measures now,'' said Luis Luis, a managing director at Scudder
Kemper Investments in Boston. ``I'd expect rates to go higher, but
they have to take these measures because international events are
hitting Mexico really hard. We're just seeing a fire sale of
assets.''
</P>
<P>
   After the peso, which has declined by more than 20 percent this
year, again fell precipitously in morning trading, the central bank
sold $100 million of Mexico's international reserves as part of a
regular system of currency auctions. Under the terms of those
auctions, the exchange rate was set as an average of bids from the
country's 17 commercial banks, a senior Central Bank official said.
</P>
<P>
   When that sale had no appreciable effect on the value of the
peso, the bank's five-member Board of Governors decided to
intervene with an extraordinary direct sale of dollars, its first
such measure since December 1995, the official said. The bank sold
an additional $278 million at market rates, said the official.
Hours later, the bank sold $100 million more under its regular
auction system.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of reserves failed to keep the peso stable, but
prevented its price from plunging more rapidly.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We were satisfied, because without our intervention, the peso
would have closed at a lower level still,'' the bank official said.
</P>
<P>
   The value of the Mexican peso floats with the market. Unlike
Venezuela and Brazil, whose central banks have been selling
billions of dollars in reserves to support overvalued currencies
that trade within a fixed band, Mexico has not seen any significant
decline in its international reserves in recent weeks. Mexico's
reserves were $30.7 billion at the end of July. Last Friday they
were $29.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In the news conference, Ortiz said that Thursday's intervention
aimed not to support the peso at a fixed rate but to keep it from
declining too abruptly and to supply the market with dollars on a
day when there were few sellers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the sale of dollars, the Banco de Mexico also
moved again to restrict liquidity. The central bank announced that
starting Thursday, it would leave the country's commercial banks
with 100 million pesos less than they needed, under a system known
as daily ``shorts.'' As a result, banks will need to raise interest
rates to attract sufficient working cash. Thursday's measure simply
turned up the steam on a measure adopted earlier in the current
crisis. Last month, the central bank announced that it would leave
banks 70 million pesos short each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to protect Mexico as much as we can against the
hurricane that's hitting us from overseas,'' the central bank
official said. ``We want investors to distinguish Mexico from
Brazil and Bulgaria and Singapore and all the other emerging
markets.'' &QL;

AUSTRIA TO RETURN ITS PLUNDERED ART  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WALTER V. ROBINSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Austrian government, facing mounting evidence that its
museums have long been an illicit repository for thousands of
artworks seized from Jews during World War II, moved Thursday to
create a commission that would return the art to families that have
waited six decades for justice.
</P>
<P>
   The government's action came on the heels of new disclosures of
the extent of the unreturned plunder. Just one museum, Vienna's
famous Museum of the History of Art, recently completed a study
suggesting that at least 915 objects in its collections have a
tainted past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The museums didn't want to return anything they had,
regardless of the justice of the claim,'' said Alice Kantor, a
retired CBS News researcher from New York City who was rebuffed by
Vienna's Albertina Museum in the 1970s when she sought the return
of a Gustav Klimt drawing.
</P>
<P>
   The Klimt was one of 222 artworks that the Nazis confiscated
after Kantor and her family fled Austria in 1938. Only two were
ever recovered. Kantor said the government's proposal now gives her
hope that the Klimt will be returned and that perhaps other works
belonging to her family will be located.
</P>
<P>
   For Austria, the disclosures have been a three-fold
embarrassment: First, Jews were stripped of their artworks after
the bloodless German Anschluss in 1938, when Austria was united
with Germany. Second, many of the country's museums acquired art _
like the Kantors' Klimt _ during the war that they had reason to
suspect had been looted from Jews. And third, during years of
post-war bureaucratic extortion, government museums very often
returned a portion of the artworks claimed by Jews, but only after
the owners agreed to let the museums keep other major works.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Jewish victims hailed the government's decision to
make amends. Bettina Looram _ the daughter of Alphonse Rothschild,
one of the best-known victims of the art plundering _ said in a
telephone interview that Elisabeth Gehrer, Austria's minister for
education and cultural affairs, has displayed ``extraordinary
courage'' in pushing the restitution.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the government review excludes the Leopold Foundation,
a quasi-government agency. The Leopold's loan of artworks to New
York's Museum of Modern Art last year ignited the controversy that
led to the press disclosures in Vienna and prompted the government
action Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Just as MoMA concluded the exhibition of the foundation's
collection of works by the Austrian painter Egon Schiele, American
Jewish claimants to two of the Schiele paintings demanded return of
the works, ``Dead City'' and ``Portrait of Wally.''
</P>
<P>
   MoMA refused, but Manhattan District Attorney Robert M.
Morgenthau subpoenaed the paintings, effectively keeping them in
New York City. A lower court has ruled the subpoena invalid, but
Morgenthau has appealed the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation's collection was acquired by the government from
art collector Rudolf Leopold. Though Leopold exerts substantial
influence on the foundation, the government holds a majority of
seats on its board.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting by Hubertus Czernin, an Austrian arts journalist,
first disclosed the governmental complicity in February. Czernin,
who reported new details this week, said last night that the
government will have no choice but to include the Leopold
collection in its search for misappropriated works.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the paintings Leopold acquired have uncertain ownership
histories ``and were purchased by Leopold during a period, in the
1950s and 1960s, when many artworks with questionable pasts were
sold,'' Czernin said. Since the New York claims surfaced, Leopold
has insisted that he acquired the collection in good faith, from
owners who had legal title.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence M. Kaye is a New York art law specialist who represents
the heirs of Lea Bondi Jaray, who once owned ``Portrait of Wally,''
one of the two Schiele paintings in legal limbo in New York. Kaye
said Thursday that his clients welcome the steps the Austrian
government is taking and hope that those steps ``lead to the
restitution of all artworks wrongfully taken from victims of the
Holocaust.''
</P>
<P>
   But there ``has been no indication from either the Austrian
government or the Leopold Foundation that they intend to return the
painting to the Bondi family, its rightful owners,'' Kaye said.
</P>
<P>
   One victim almost certain to recoup her family's art is Looram,
the wife of a retired American diplomat. She said her mother,
Clarice, regained Alphonse Rothschild's extensive art collection
after the war.
</P>
<P>
   The Austrian government, however, refused to issue an export
permit. ``But then they said, `Maybe, if you're willing to donate a
third of your art collection, we'll let you export the rest,'''
Looram said.
</P>
<P>
   The return of the well-documented art objects will be relatively
easy for the government, Looram said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I am hoping very much,'' Looram said, ``is that the many
families who have tried for years and years to recover just one or
two paintings will now be able to do so.''

ALL'S QUIETER ON THE SOSA FRONT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The 43 chairs and 25 phones are still set up in the
auxiliary press room, but no one is using them.
</P>
<P>
   Fans still stand and cheer every time he comes to bat, but it
seems rather halfhearted. It's as if they no longer really expect
him to hit a homer _ and it wouldn't matter as much if he did.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that people here don't care any more about Sammy Sosa's
pursuit of the season home run record.
</P>
<P>
   It's just that the Cubs right fielder hadn't hit a home run in
four games and went hitless in his first four trips Thursday night.
And the enthusiasm here was tempered when Mark McGwire became the
first to surpass Roger Maris's 37-year-old record, hitting his 62d
Tuesday night. That's four more than Sosa has.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, Cubs fans these days are at least as
interested in their team's red-hot race for the National League
wild-card spot as they are in Sosa's quest for the long-ball mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the wild card, definitely,'' said Scott Parks, a computer
programmer from Chicago, when asked to explain why he was at the
game against the Pirates. ``I'm still pulling for Sosa to set a
record but I'm more concerned about getting in the playoffs. We
haven't been to the World Series since '45 and have been in the
playoffs only twice since then.''
</P>
<P>
   John Cable, a college professor, agreed: ``I come here to see
the Cubs in the wild card. I come to see competitive baseball. You
know what they say _ every team is entitled to a bad century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in St. Louis to see McGwire break it; however, it still
would be a tremendous accomplishment for Sosa to do it,'' he added.
``But if I had the choice of seeing him hit 62 or seeing the Cubs
go to the playoffs, I'd rather see the Cubs go.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Anderson, who drove here for the game from Valparaiso,
Ind., said he came partly because he wanted to see a night game at
Wrigley Field, which for most of its history was used only for day
games, and partly to watch Sosa. But seeing him surpass Maris, or
even McGwire, ``wouldn't mean anything,'' Anderson added, if the
Cubs don't make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment is understandable in light of the fact that going
into Thursday night's game, the Cubs were dead even with the New
York Mets in the wild-card race. And the fact that Sosa, a streak
home run hitter, is in a long-ball drought that seemed destined to
continue when he popped out, walked twice, and struck out in his
first four plate appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the glitter is gone, however. Far from it, Sosa watchers
say. Major League Baseball, for instance, still has one of its
security agents assigned to protect Sosa from adoring fans and
anyone else who might try to get too close. Fans still let out a
deafening roar, and the organist kicks into gear, every time he
steps to the plate. And no matter what some Cubs fans say about
being more focused on the playoff race, Sosa is the only reason
John J. Ralph was here Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't stopped caring in Cooperstown,'' Ralph, head of
communications and programming at the National Baseball Hall of
Fame and Museum, explained from his perch in the press box. ``We've
said all along that this home run story is a two-person story and
we'll stay with Sammy Sosa until he reaches 62.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of games left, and we're certainly not going
to turn our back on Sammy.''

RANGERS INTERESTED IN DEAL FOR PENGUINS' JAGR 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Seeking to add attacking power and return to the
Stanley Cup playoffs, the Rangers are aiming high. They hope to
trade with the Pittsburgh Penguins for Jaromir Jagr, the National
Hockey League's reigning scoring champion.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors of a possible deal have been circulating among league
personnel for several days. Although the Rangers would not comment
on Jagr, an official with an NHL club with knowledge of the talks
said there had been serious discussions among executives at Madison
Square Garden about a bid for Jagr.
</P>
<P>
   A package is expected to be offered this weekend to Craig
Patrick, the Pittsburgh general manager, as NHL teams gather for
training camps.
</P>
<P>
   Jagr, 25, is a right wing from the Czech Republic. He has been
the subject of trade speculation before. An eight-year veteran,
Jagr scored 102 points last season on 35 goals and 67 assists. But
he occasionally expressed frustration with the conservative style
of Kevin Constantine, the new coach of the Penguins. Jagr is one of
hockey's bigger players, at 6 feet 2 inches and 208 pounds, and
plays a rambunctious style by rushing the puck aggressively, arms
and legs pumping, as his long hair flies out in the breeze behind
his helmeted head.
</P>
<P>
   In this sense the Rangers, who replaced Coach Colin Campbell
with John Muckler last season, might be a good fit for Jagr. They
are expected to return to an up-tempo style, the kind preferred by
Muckler and by center Wayne Gretzky, the team's best-known star,
who finished tied for third among NHL scorers with 90 points.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor is money. Although they missed the playoffs last
season, the Rangers are among the wealthiest franchises in the
sport. The Penguins are not, despite reaching the post-season. A
dispute and power struggle between the Penguins' co-owners, Howard
Baldwin and Roger Marino, has led to at least two meetings this
summer with Commissioner Gary Bettman of the NHL.Marino has talked
of filing for bankruptcy, although such a move could result in loss
of the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Marino is being sued by the management company that runs Civic
Arena, by the television company that owns broadcasting rights and
by Mario Lemieux, the former Pittsburgh star who retired in 1997.
Lemieux's lawsuit is for about $32 million in deferred salary.
Lemieux has also filed a salary grievance against the team for
about $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Marino, who paid $40 million for his half of the team in 1997,
has said the Penguins lost $17 million last season as attendance
dropped 10 percent following Lemieux's retirement. The Penguins'
payroll could become a problem, especially when Jagr's new contract
takes effect next season. He is to earn $4,988,491 this season,
$10,359,852 next season, $9,482,709 in 2000-2001, $10,007,165 in
2001-2002 and $10,733,333 in 2002-2003.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, who led the league last season in payroll at almost
$45 million, have some salary room this season because Pat
LaFontaine retired. He was to earn $4.8 million, but cannot play
because of repeated concussions. Insurance payments will cover most
of his salary.
</P>
<P>
   But who could the Rangers trade that would make equal value for
Jagr? The Penguins lost Ron Francis, their veteran center, this
summer, partly because they chose not to match the salary he was
offered by the Carolina Hurricanes. So they need a center, a
position where the Rangers are thin. Aside from Gretzky, the best
Rangers are defenseman Brian Leetch and goalie Mike Richter. But
they earn large salaries and would not fit into the Pittsburgh
roster.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most talented Rangers with more modest salaries are
forwards Niklas Sundstrom and Aleksei Kovalev, both veterans in
their 20's. Another attractive forward might be Manny Malhotra, a
rookie center drafted in the first round last June. High draft
choices might be part of the package.

<P>
   ROME _ After four months on the run, Licio Gelli, 79, one of
Italy's most wanted fugitives, was captured Thursday in Cannes,
France, by the Italian and French police.
</P>
<P>
   Gelli was convicted in 1992 of fraud linked to the 1982 collapse
of Banco Ambrosiano, one of Italy's leading banks, which had ties
to the Vatican. The Banco Ambrosiano affair was one of Italy's
worst post-war scandals.
</P>
<P>
   Gelli's conviction was upheld by an appeals court in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Italy's highest court also upheld the conviction and
sentenced him to 12 years in prison. But Gelli, who was living
under house arrest in his villa in Tuscany, disappeared before the
police arrived to take him into custody.
</P>
<P>
   He was captured Thursday when undercover police officers
followed Gelli's wife from her house in Monaco to the apartment
where he was living in disguise.
</P>
<P>
   His escape had deeply humiliated Italian law enforcement
officials and the government.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Romano Prodi expressed ``relief and
satisfaction'' over the arrest, and said the operation ``heals a
serious wound.''

AUSTRIA TO RETURN ITS PLUNDERED ART  
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Austrian government, facing mounting evidence that its
museums have long been an illicit repository for thousands of
artworks seized from Jews during World War II, moved Thursday to
create a commission that would return the art to families that have
waited six decades for justice.
</P>
<P>
   The government's action came on the heels of new disclosures of
the extent of the unreturned plunder. Just one museum, Vienna's
famous Museum of the History of Art, recently completed a study
suggesting that at least 915 objects in its collections have a
tainted past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The museums didn't want to return anything they had,
regardless of the justice of the claim,'' said Alice Kantor, a
retired CBS News researcher from New York City who was rebuffed by
Vienna's Albertina Museum in the 1970s when she sought the return
of a Gustav Klimt drawing.
</P>
<P>
   The Klimt was one of 222 artworks that the Nazis confiscated
after Kantor and her family fled Austria in 1938. Only two were
ever recovered. Kantor said the government's proposal now gives her
hope that the Klimt will be returned and that perhaps other works
belonging to her family will be located.
</P>
<P>
   For Austria, the disclosures have been a three-fold
embarrassment: First, Jews were stripped of their artworks after
the bloodless German Anschluss in 1938, when Austria was united
with Germany. Second, many of the country's museums acquired art _
like the Kantors' Klimt _ during the war that they had reason to
suspect had been looted from Jews. And third, during years of
post-war bureaucratic extortion, government museums very often
returned a portion of the artworks claimed by Jews, but only after
the owners agreed to let the museums keep other major works.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Jewish victims hailed the government's decision to
make amends. Bettina Looram _ the daughter of Alphonse Rothschild,
one of the best-known victims of the art plundering _ said in a
telephone interview that Elisabeth Gehrer, Austria's minister for
education and cultural affairs, has displayed ``extraordinary
courage'' in pushing the restitution.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the government review excludes the Leopold Foundation,
a quasi-government agency. The Leopold's loan of artworks to New
York's Museum of Modern Art last year ignited the controversy that
led to the press disclosures in Vienna and prompted the government
action Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Just as MoMA concluded the exhibition of the foundation's
collection of works by the Austrian painter Egon Schiele, American
Jewish claimants to two of the Schiele paintings demanded return of
the works, ``Dead City'' and ``Portrait of Wally.''
</P>
<P>
   MoMA refused, but Manhattan District Attorney Robert M.
Morgenthau subpoenaed the paintings, effectively keeping them in
New York City. A lower court has ruled the subpoena invalid, but
Morgenthau has appealed the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation's collection was acquired by the government from
art collector Rudolf Leopold. Though Leopold exerts substantial
influence on the foundation, the government holds a majority of
seats on its board.

has insisted that he acquired the collection in good faith, from

</P>
<P>
   Lawrence M. Kaye is a New York art law specialist who represents
the heirs of Lea Bondi Jaray, who once owned ``Portrait of Wally,''
one of the two Schiele paintings in legal limbo in New York. Kaye
said Thursday that his clients welcome the steps the Austrian
government is taking and hope that those steps ``lead to the
restitution of all artworks wrongfully taken from victims of the
Holocaust.''
</P>
<P>
   But there ``has been no indication from either the Austrian
government or the Leopold Foundation that they intend to return the
painting to the Bondi family, its rightful owners,'' Kaye said.
</P>
<P>
   One victim almost certain to recoup her family's art is Looram,
the wife of a retired American diplomat. She said her mother,
Clarice, regained Alphonse Rothschild's extensive art collection
after the war.

Looram said.

<P>
   The return of the well-documented art objects will be relatively
easy for the government, Looram said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I am hoping very much,'' Looram said, ``is that the many
families who have tried for years and years to recover just one or
two paintings will now be able to do so.''

<P>
   DENVER _ He asked his dad, the old coach. He asked his wife, his
longtime best friend. He asked his children, his most adoring fans.
He asked close pals from the world of football, experts on the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   And then, just before John Elway was ready to decide whether to
fold up his legendary NFL career, at the age of 38 with 15 years of
excellence and, finally, a Super Bowl title, he asked, of all
people, baseball great Johnny Bench.
</P>
<P>
   Bench, the catcher who stretched his Hall of Fame career by
milking a few less-than-brilliant late years from his body as a
third baseman and first baseman, advised Elway to make sure he left
the game with no regrets, and not to do so unless he was certain he
wouldn't ever look back.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really hit me,'' said Elway, poised to continue the
Denver Broncos' defense of their championship Sunday at Mile High
Stadium against the Cowboys. ``Our team is still good. I feel like
I can still play at a high level. I guess I wasn't ready to say I'd
have no regrets.''
</P>
<P>
   The only strike against Elway continuing to play at a high level
has nothing to do with his skills. Coach Mike Shanahan said Elway
throws the ball with as much zip as ever, and he zipped 22 of his
34 pass attempts for completions and 257 yards of passing in the
season opener Monday night against New England.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, something about the age of 38 for
quarterbacks that seems less-than-magical.
</P>
<P>
   That's the age George Blanda became primarily a kicker, the age
John Brodie was benched, the age Y.A. Tittle faltered, the age Fran
Tarkenton decided a 32-interception season was enough, the age Ken
Stabler decided to give it up, the age Phil Simms was released, the
age Jim Hart was demoted, the age Billy Kilmer was replaced, the
age Joe Montana was finished, the age Len Dawson, Sam Baugh, Jim
Plunkett and Sonny Jurgensen succumbed to injuries that led to
their retirements.
</P>
<P>
   Can the Cowboys' Troy Aikman, who turns 32 in November, see
himself playing through that age when so many quarterbacks seem to
hit the wall?
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what? I don't know that if you asked John when he was
31 if he could have envisioned himself playing at 38,'' Aikman
said. ``I guess, to be honest, the answer is no. Realistically
there aren't many guys who can sit there and say I'm going to play
16 or 17 years in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   The age of 38 was also when Johnny Unitas ran out of gas.
Unitas, like Elway, won a Super Bowl title late in his career. For
Unitas, it was in the 1970 season, with the Baltimore Colts. But,
the next season, the Colts benched him, then traded him to San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Unitas' final season with the Chargers was 1973. Before giving
up the No. 1 job to Dan Fouts, Unitas started just five games, with
three touchdown passes, seven interceptions, a 44.7 completion
percentage for a team that finished 2-11-1.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked after his championship season whether the timing
for retirement was perfect, Unitas answered a reporter famously:
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had just won the Pulitzer Prize,'' Unitas quipped,
``would you retire the next year?''
</P>
<P>
   Elway, who needs just 1,074 passing yards to join Miami's Dan
Marino in the 50,000 club for an NFL career, gives essentially the
same reply when asked why he decided to continue to play. Simply,
he's having fun being on top.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did he look 38?'' said Broncos tight end Shannon Sharpe,
reviewing Monday night's 27-21 victory against New England. ``No
way.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, for whatever reason, Elway now might be backing down
from an earlier proclamation that 1998 would be his final season.
Backup quarterback Bubby Brister, who played host to Elway in a
Louisiana fishing trip during which Elway made his much-awaited
decision to return for one year, suggests his buddy would be wise
to be open to options.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the type of system we're in, with Terrell (Davis)
running, and how (Elway) keeps in shape, I can see John playing
until he's 40,'' Brister said. ``Heck, he's outplaying everybody in
the league right now. I'd take him over what's out there any day.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Elway keeps the exit door ajar not because he's still
elite, and not because he's truly interested in playing in 1999,
but because he has so little interest in the mushy public love
affairs often triggered by the retirement of sports stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not getting sentimental,'' said Elway, who probably had
enough of that during Super Bowl week, when America reviewed his
history of Super failures and cuddled him like a favorite, ragged
teddy bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like most of America,'' Aikman remembered, ``I was pulling for
Denver. I think it was out of respect for John and what he's meant
to this league for so long.''
</P>
<P>
   So now, there is less pressure on Elway than ever. There are no
queries about Super Bowl losses, about his problems with former
boss Dan Reeves, about the famed quarterback Class of 1983
bridesmaids.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure for us was to get that first one under our
belt,'' Elway said. ``Now it's just a matter of going out and
playing as well as we can and trying to repeat.''

<P>
   KIAMESHA LAKE, N.Y. _ At the last meal of the season in the
Concord Resort Hotel's 3,000-seat dining room, Table C-8, always
the loudest, was even louder than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Swamped by plates of baked lasagna, all 10 people sitting around
the white-clothed table were talking and laughing and arguing at
once, as comfortable in their spot at the front and center of the
room as stage veterans. ``This table,'' Jerry Angel announced, ``is
the table for the ages.''
</P>
<P>
   Table C-8, made up of couples and singles from Brooklyn,
Manhattan, Westchester, Long Island and New Jersey, is a
more-than-quarter-century-old institution at a hotel that has
survived through its institutions. Regular Concord guests come to
know Table C-8 as the clique of cliques, the mature version of the
popular students in high school.
</P>
<P>
   Every summer, the members of C-8 meet for weekends here, sharing
their three kosher meals a day in the same seating order. At the
end of August, they always throw a birthday party for Patty Garcia,
their waitress. On Labor Day, they inevitably spend the lunch
before checkout hooting and hollering at the shenanigans of the
past summer and talking about next year's.
</P>
<P>
   But not this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next year?'' said Angel, C-8's unofficial leader, as competing
conversations halted. ``We don't know. We just don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the last summer of the Concord Resort Hotel as its
devotees have known it. The largest and most famous of the Catskill
Mountain hotels, where the likes of Jerry Lewis, Woody Allen and
Don Rickles paid their dues, is bankrupt, a sorry reminder of the
declining fortunes of a resort area once known as the Jewish
Riviera.
</P>
<P>
   The family that has owned the Concord since it opened 61 years
ago is reluctantly selling it to pay off more than $20 million in
debts. The future of the hotel, the largest employer in Sullivan
County, with 800 employees, is in limbo.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of this month, a Bankruptcy Court judge is expected
to announce which of several prospective bidders can try to secure
the financing to buy the hotel. One, Value Co., part of an
investment group based in Manhattan, has been trying to find
investors since January to remake the hotel into a first-class
resort, and has an agreement with Sheraton Corp. to make the hotel
a franchise. Another applicant specializes in buying bankrupt
hotels and converting them into condominiums. Touro College, with
campuses in Nassau County and Israel, has expressed interest in
converting at least part of the hotel into a campus.
</P>
<P>
   Even if it remains a hotel, the Concord, one of only a handful
of family-owned resorts left in the Catskills, will be different.
The absurdly large dining hall, where guests have eaten all they
can eat at the same times, much as in summer camp, will surely be
gone. So will the kosher-only kitchen, and most likely, some of the
employees, many of whom have worked here 30, 40, even 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Table C-8 and the other faithful guests who call the Concord a
second home have known for years that they cannot keep the hotel
alive by themselves. It has long become obvious that the guest list
has been declining, and so has the hotel. The huge guest rooms,
even those in the tower wing of the hotel, built 20 years ago, have
worn carpets and faded wallpaper. The traditional guests, adults
middle-aged and older who remember the good old days, have been
unable to persuade their children and grandchildren to come here,
only 90 miles from New York City, instead of to spiffier resorts on
an ocean beach. Even on Labor Day weekend, the hotel, with 1,200
rooms, was only half full.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the idea of the Concord's changing in any of its intimate
ways _ the notion that the side lobby where the house orchestra
performs big-band music might become just another place for potted
palm trees or that the exercise classes by Gilda Marx, the art
demonstrations by Morris Katz (``the world's fastest painter'') and
the noisy happiness of Table C-8 might become pressed memories for
the scrapbook _ has given the resort the wistful air of a wake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cry,'' said Irving Cohen, the maitre d'hotel, who has worked
here for 55 years. For decades, Cohen, now 80, has carefully
assigned the seating in the dining room to put single women next to
single men, a sly talent that has led to more than 100 Concord
marriages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been to more weddings and bar mitzvahs _ it's been a
great time,'' Cohen said. (As guests stopped by his post in the
front of the dining room to say goodbye, his round cheeks were
pinched, patted and pecked more than a baby's.) ``Now, with
everything uncertain and all the employees worrying about their
jobs, it's a very sad time,'' he added. ``I think some of the
employees are even more upset than the owners.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Parker, one of the five brothers and sisters in their 40s
and 50s who inherited the hotel from their parents and
grandparents, was sitting just yards away. As chief executive of
the hotel, he has not looked happy for a long time, even when
joking with guests he has known his whole life. ``It should be an
interesting few months here,'' he said with a grimace that was
trying to be a grin.
</P>
<P>
   Employees don't blame the Parker family for the hotel's demise.
They blame the people who abandoned the Catskills for Atlantic City
or more exotic locales. Marilyn Gill, who gave up drug counseling
to become a waitress here 26 years ago, compares the situation at
the Concord to one at the Catskills hotel in the movie ``Dirty
Dancing,'' which she has seen 47 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, how at the end of the movie, they talked about the
end of an era, people wanting to take trips to Europe instead of
driving to the mountains? I think that's what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   But that film was set in 1963. The Concord held its own until
the mid-to-late '70s, during the recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think people started thinking they could go abroad for
the money they'd spend at a weekend here,'' Ms. Gill said. ``But I
don't think there's any place that gives you dollar value like the
Concord. Three meals a day and all activities included?''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gill was sitting in the dining room on a break with Pat
Kislowski, who has worked here 15 years, and Eva Molnar, who has
worked here for 32.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times when people used to have to beg to have a day
off,'' Ms. Molnar said. ``Now, they wait by the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We all love the hotel,'' Ms. Kislowski said. ``We're all like
family.'' When an old porter who had been at the hotel 25 years
developed prostate cancer, she said by way of example, the staff
took care of him until his death, then chipped in to pay for a
funeral service and a death notice. ``It was sad that he had no
family,'' Ms. Kislowski said. ``But he had us.''
</P>
<P>
   In February, Ms. Gill said, the staff started a petition to get
the governor's help in keeping the hotel open. ``We got 600
names,'' she said. ``We wanted him to sit down and listen to us
talk about what the Concord means to Sullivan County. He sent us
back a form letter.''
</P>
<P>
   Some longtime guests refuse to believe that their Concord days
may be over. Lenny Weissman of Manhattan, a regular at Table C-12,
which was once known as the bachelors' table, said the hotel had
been too much a part of his life for 26 years to see it end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got separated in March of 1972, and believe it or not, they
had an April in Paris singles weekend here the next month,'' he
said. ``That was the beginning for me. From '72 to '95, I got more
phone numbers weekends here in the summer than I got for all the
other 42 weeks of the year combined. Then I fell in love here.''
</P>
<P>
   His career as an Eligible Male ended when he met Judy Borzi. She
happens to be the hotel's official matchmaker, but the match she
made in this case was for herself. She and Weissman now live
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've put together hundreds of couples,'' said Ms. Borzi, who
also runs People Link, a traditional dating service in Manhattan.
``Then my own vocation became self-fulfilling.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the Concord's traditions, poker and matchmaking seem to
inspire the most bragging. At least half a dozen guests claimed to
be excellent at one or the other. Barbara and Bernie Schwartz of
Queens, Table C-8 members, claim to have mastered both. ``I play
poker and Bernie has put hundreds of people together,'' Mrs.
Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of lonely people,'' he said, ``for whom this is
their only social life.'' Including, he said, lowering his
voice,''some people at this table.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the Concord closes, C-8 as a group will most likely
survive. ``We're all friends,'' said Joyce Zolna of Verona, N.J.
``We see each other in the city. We're already planning a Halloween
party.''
</P>
<P>
   And if the Concord reopens in another incarnation? ``It will be
a terrible shame if somebody buys this hotel and changes it,'' said
Cynthia Rechtman, sitting next to Ms. Zolna.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though we have so much fun,'' Ms. Zolna said, ``we'll probably
come back next year if it's open.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll come back here once,'' Angel said. ``We'll see what's
left and what's not.''

   INTEREST RATES SLIDE AS STOCK PRICES TUMBLE
</P>
<P>
   The prices of Treasury securities jumped, sending the yields on
10-year notes and 30-year bonds down to levels not seen since 1967.
The yield of the 30-year bond dropped to 5.19 percent, from 5.26
percent on Wednesday. The decline shows that investors are betting
that the Federal Reserve will cut short-term interest rates, a move
that could help stabilize stock markets here and abroad. But the
decline in stocks continued to accelerate. The Dow Jones industrial
average tumbled 249.48 points, or 3.17 percent. The Dow is down
18.4 percent since its July 17 peak. Stocks skidded even more
sharply in Europe and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   NORTHWEST AIRLINES ACCORD REACHED
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators for Northwest Airlines and its pilots' union reached
a tentative agreement to settle their bitter labor dispute, but the
accord stopped short of immediately ending the 13-day strike that
has disrupted travel in the Midwest and South because the union
still has to decide whether to accept it.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICAN BANK FAILS TO PROP UP PESO
</P>
<P>
   Panic selling swept the Mexican stock exchange, where the chief
market index plunged 9.82 percent. The Mexican central bank waded
into currency markets selling nearly $500 million in dollars and
tightening cash in circulation in an unsuccessful effort to support
the peso.
</P>
<P>
   THE RUBLE'S WILD RIDE
</P>
<P>
   The Russian ruble, after falling to 5 cents to the dollar in
recent days, shot back up to 9 cents, so Russians who had bought
dollars as a safe haven discovered that they were worth far less.
</P>
<P>
   A LOSS FOR NATIONAL SEMICONDUCTOR
</P>
<P>
   Shares of National Semiconductor fell 31.25 cents, or 3.38
percent, to $8.9375, after the company reported a loss that fell
slightly below analysts' estimates. National Semiconductor had
predicted last month that its fiscal first-quarter results would be
weak, but executives said orders had begun to pick up in August,
and if the current order rate persisted they believed results next
quarter would be stronger.
</P>
<P>
   TRADE DEFICIT CLIMBED IN 2ND QUARTER
</P>
<P>
   The nation's trade deficit in goods, services and investments
widened to a record $56.525 billion in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   VENATOR-SPORTS AUTHORITY DEAL OFF
</P>
<P>
   Venator Group and Sports Authority canceled their planned merger
because the stock of Venator, formerly Woolworth, has dropped 61
percent since the plans were made in May _ cutting the value of the
deal to about $398.5 million in stock and assumed debt, from more

   Volkswagen AG plans to announce Friday that it will create a $12

suits over slave labor against Volkswagen and many other German
industrial companies for their use of slave labor during World War
II.

 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The report sent to Congress by the Whitewater
independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, contends that evidence shows
that President Clinton committed perjury, obstructed justice,
tampered with witnesses and abused the power of his office, in
trying to cover up an affair with Monica Lewinsky, lawyers familiar
with the report said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's 445-page report asserts that Clinton lied during his
civil deposition in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit in
January and during his grand jury testimony last month from the
White House, three lawyers who insisted on anonymity said.
</P>
<P>
   In a 140-page section that outlines possible grounds for
impeachment, prosecutors accuse Clinton of abuse of power, one of
the impeachment counts leveled against Richard Nixon in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   That section also outlines Starr's contention that the president
relied on government lawyers and senior aides to deny repeatedly to
the public that &UR;  &LR; Clinton had an inappropriate or improper
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, the 25-year-old former White House
intern. And, the lawyers said, prosecutors are also critical of the
privilege claims filed by government lawyers to try to block the
grand jury testimony of White House aides and lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also give details that they say show how Clinton
tried to influence the testimony of Ms. Lewinsky and his personal
secretary. They also include evidence that they say demonstrates
that he obstructed justice through trying to help Ms. Lewinsky find
a job and retrieve gifts that had been subpoenaed in the Jones
case.
</P>
<P>
   The report to Congress finds no impeachable offenses in the bulk
of Starr's four-year-old inquiry on such matters as the Whitewater
land deal or the alleged misuse of FBI files and potential coverup
in the White House travel office. Lawyers say, however, that the
report draws parallels between the White House conduct in the
Lewinsky inquiry and efforts, they say, that were made in the
Whitewater inquiry to cover up what actually happened.
</P>
<P>
   The long-awaited report, which the House of Representatives
plans to post on the Internet on Friday, is ``a damaging narrative
that reads like a novel,'' one lawyer familiar with its contents
said Thursday. ``It accuses the president of lying and obstructing,
over and over.''
</P>
<P>
   But during a meeting with Senate Democrats at the White House,
Clinton assured them they would find ``no surprises'' in Starr's
report.
</P>
<P>
   David Kendall, the president's lawyer, said Thursday that the
report is nothing more than a collection of prosecutors'
``contentions, claims and allegations and we look forward to the
chance to rebut them.''
</P>
<P>
   A copy of the report was not made available to The New York
Times, but the shape of the report was described in interviews on
Thursday with three lawyers who said they were familiar with its
contents.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation of the obstruction of justice part of the report
is the allegation that Clinton played a pivotal role in an attempt
by his friend, Vernon Jordan, to find Ms. Lewinsky a job in the
private sector last December, the lawyers said. The report also
lays out a case that the president played a role in Ms. Lewinsky's
decision to return several Presidential gifts, which had been
sought by a subpoena from the Jones lawyers, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Both actions were intended to keep Ms. Lewinsky from telling the
truth to the Jones lawyers about her sexual relationship with the
president, the prosecutors contend.
</P>
<P>
   In his grand jury testimony, Clinton denied that he had sought
to help Ms. Lewinsky secure a job or retrieve the gifts, his allies
have said.
</P>
<P>
   The report also details the fact that Clinton summoned his
secretary, Betty Currie, to the White House on Sunday, Jan. 18, the
day after Clinton was asked a series of questions about Ms.
Lewinsky, including private visits she had with Clinton, a lawyer
said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In February, a White House official dismissed the Currie meeting
as an effort by the president to ``refresh his recollection'' about
Ms. Lewinsky's visits and other matters. The report said that
Clinton had other motives for summoning Mrs. Currie on that Sunday
in January. It said that he asked her a series of questions in an
attempt to influence her as a potential witness in the Jones case,
the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors contend that Clinton also tried to interfere with
the Paula Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit against him as early as
the summer of 1997, the lawyers said. In May 1997, the Supreme
Court ruled, unanimously, that the Jones lawsuit would proceed
while Clinton was still in office. Within a week, Mrs. Jones'
lawyers had said they would attempt to interview under oath other
women linked to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   That summer, the report says, Clinton asked Ms. Lewinsky to keep
their relationship a secret. That request came six months before
the former White House intern was subpoenaed to testify in the
case, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers said he also encouraged Ms. Lewinsky to urge her friend
and another potential witness, Linda Tripp, to stay silent about a
White House volunteer named Kathleen Willey. Ms. Willey said she
resisted an unwanted sexual advance from the president just outside
the Oval Office. At the time, a Newsweek reporter was attempting to
interview Mrs. Tripp, who bumped into Ms. Willey shortly after the
alleged encounter.
</P>
<P>
   In the 140-page section that lays out the grounds for possible
impeachment proceedings, there are several ``salacious and
detailed'' references to sexual encounters between Clinton and Ms.
Lewinsky inside the president's private study near the Oval Office,
the lawyers said.

 WASHINGTON: lawyers said.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A lawyer who is familiar with Starr's strategy said that
prosecutors felt they had to include such material in the section
of the report that discusses whether Clinton had lied to the grand
jury. Clinton denied in his grand jury testimony that he lied about
their relationship in his Jones deposition.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 17, Clinton testified to the grand jury that he had
``inappropriate intimate physical contact'' with Ms. Lewinsky. But
he insisted that the contacts did not meet the definition of
``sexual relations'' established in the Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in his address to the nation that evening, Clinton said
his answers in the Jones deposition about Ms. Lewinsky were
``legally accurate,'' though he acknowledged they were misleading.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say in the report, however, that Clinton lied before
the grand jury when he said that his sexual encounters with Ms.
Lewinsky did not constitute ``sexual relations,'' as defined in the
Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors argue that the president's decision not to answer
those questions compelled them to have Ms. Lewinsky return to the
grand jury and answer more detailed questions about the precise
nature of her sexual encounters with Clinton, the lawyers said.
Many of those graphic details are included in the report, including
a discussion of the now-infamous blue dress that Ms. Lewinsky
turned over to prosecutors, according to lawyers familiar with the
reports' contents.
</P>
<P>
   ``As uncomfortable as this topic may be, there was an obligation
to present it,'' one Starr ally said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A three-part definition of ``sexual relations'' was prepared by
Ms. Jones' lawyers before Clinton's Jan. 17 deposition. But in
responding to an objection of Clinton's lawyer, Judge Susan Webber
Wright of Federal District Court in Little Rock, Ark. limited the
definition from three parts to just Part I:
</P>
<P>
   ``For the purposes of this deposition, a person engages in
`sexual relations' when the person knowingly engages in or causes
contact with the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or
buttocks of any person with an intent to arouse or gratify the
sexual desire of any person.''
</P>
<P>
   But when he was asked in the deposition about Ms. Lewinsky,
Clinton consulted the same definition before he denied that he had
had sexual relations with the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the testimony of Ms. Lewinsky about what happened
during those encounters, prosecutors believe that denial was a lie
under oath, the lawyers said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the prosecutors contend there is evidence that the
president lied several times in the Jones deposition on Jan. 17.
They specifically highlight the president's denial that he had been
alone with Ms. Lewinsky, except on one or two occasions when she
handed him documents in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   While working around the clock over the Labor Day weekend and
intensely for the past several weeks, prosecutors in Starr's office
had always intended to file the report ``as quickly as possible,''
one lawyer said. There was originally a plan to send a referral
letter to Speaker Newt Gingrich and minority leader Richard
Gephardt on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But some lawyers in the office were concerned that Kendall would
possibly file a motion trying to limit the report's contents, or
demanding its early release, with U.S. District Judge Norma
Holloway Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, some staff members of the House Judiciary
Committee had sent signals, through suggestions to news reporters,
that they hoped Starr would write and submit an executive summary,
which could easily be made public. And, lawyers said Thursday,
prosecutors did in fact draw up a draft of an executive summary,
but Starr himself concluded that it was too argumentative and
scrapped the summary's working draft.

 &HT;    Lopez HR enough for Millwood
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Call it a meet-and-beat. Stuck in their worst slump
in two years, the Braves called Thursday for bad baseball's
traditional aerosol can: A pre-game, players-only meeting. Then
they went and took their frustrations out on the Expos, winning 7-4
before 8,455 at Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   A three-run home run by Javy Lopez (his 33rd homer of the year)
gave him 101 RBIs and gave the Braves three 100-RBI guys (Andres
Galarraga, Chipper Jones and Lopez) for the second time in modern
franchise history. More important, it broke Atlanta's three-game
losing streak, ended a 2-5 road trip on an upbeat and gave credence
to the notion that the meeting helped.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting lasted 30 minutes and featured three main speakers:
Tom Glavine, Chipper Jones and Ryan Klesko. Glavine was as direct
as he'd been after Wednesday's 3-2 loss. ``I think it went well,''
Glavine said of the meeting, which stressed two points: The need to
start playing better now, not in October; and the need to put team
goals ahead of individual accomplishments. There's no ``i'' in
post-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question we're not playing well enough to win in
the playoffs right now,'' Glavine said. ``Anybody who thinks we are
is watching a different team than I am. Nobody denied that (in the
meeting).''
</P>
<P>
   Not with the Braves having lost eight of their last 10 games,
their worst stretch since a nearly identical one in 1996, when they
lost 11 of 13 games from Aug. 31-Sept. 14 that year. This time,
Glavine's message was clear: ``You can't coast for two, three weeks
and, come the playoffs, flip on a switch and start doing the things
you've got to do. We've got to start doing things now.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta started well against Mike Thurman. Ozzie Guillen
singled, went to third on Wilton Guerrero's throwing error on a
grounder by Keith Lockhart (making his first start since Sept. 1)
and scored on Chipper Jones' sacrifice fly. It was just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Millwood, shelled here June 19 five days after firing a
four-hitter at the Expos, gave back the run on Guerrero's leadoff
double and two sacrifices. But then Millwood settled down and the
Braves teed off.
</P>
<P>
   After manufacturing a run on a walk, single and ground-out in
the second, Javy Lopez gave Millwood a 5-1 cushion in the third.
After walks to Chipper Jones and Andres Galarraga, Lopez crushed
his 33rd homer.
</P>
<P>
   Thurman was gone after the third and Atlanta added two more runs
off a succession of relievers.

 &HT;    Players meet, focus on team results
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Montreal _ With the postseason looming and Atlanta mired in its
worst stretch of bad baseball in two years, the Braves held a
players-only meeting before Thursday's road trip finale against the
Expos. Consider the air cleared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it went well,'' said Tom Glavine. ``It doesn't take a
brain surgeon to know we're not playing well. That wasn't the point
you had to get across.''
</P>
<P>
   The points that Glavine, Chipper Jones, Ryan Klesko and another
player or two made during the 30-minute meeting were this: The
Braves need to start playing better ball now, not come the NL
Division Series; and players need to focus on that, not individual
accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a situation where we've got to make sure we're all
on the same page and trying to accomplish the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Individual accomplishments mean nothing in the (season's) last
couple of weeks,'' Klesko said. ``We've got to get ready for the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   All this was prompted by a 1-5 start to the road trip, including
two straight losses here to the lowly Expos. More untimely hitting
and poor fundamentals also led to Wednesday's 3-2 loss when John
Rocker gave up a leadoff ninth-inning homer to Chris Widger.
</P>
<P>
   With that, the Braves had lost eight of their last 10 games,
their worst stretch since losing 11-of-13 from Aug. 31-Sept. 14 of
1996. Those Braves then won 10 of their next 15 games and the NL
East by eight games, rallied to win the pennant and had a 2-0 lead
over the Yankees before losing the World Series in six games. These
Braves, having fallen behind Houston Wednesday in the race for the
NL's best record (and home-field advantage) in the post-season
wanted to talk amongst themselves Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that the playoffs are two weeks away makes this a
different situation,'' Glavine said. ``We're not in July or August.
We all know we need to start playing better. We had to make people
realize we have to do it now, we can't sit back and wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home-field advantage is going to be a big deal. Yeah, we've
got a big lead in our division but we've still got something to
play for.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When we're clicking, there's not a team in baseball that can
beat us,'' said Jones. ``If we go out there and execute and bunt
and hit-and-run and let a pitcher get himself in trouble instead of
helping him and we get beat, I can accept that. But when you go out
and don't do those things against teams we should dominate in the
regular season, I can't accept that.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Jones knows the bottom line on the meeting: ``The
only way to see if a situation like that bears fruit is if the
problems that you were having stop happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Lock's back
</P>
<P>
   Keith Lockhart made his first start since Sept. 1, when the
second baseman had to leave a game after aggravated his strained
right hamstring.

 &HT;    On Deck: Florida Marlins
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When: Tonight at 7:40, Saturday at 7:10 p.m., Sunday at 1:10
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   TV/radio: TBS and WSB 750-AM will broadcast all three games.
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: Tonight, RHP John Smoltz (14-3,
3.13; 6-2, 3.41 lifetime vs. Marlins) vs. LHP Kirt Ojala (2-4,
3.72; 1-0, 0.00 vs Braves). Saturday, TBA vs. RHP Livan Hernandez
(10-11, 4.87; 0-1, 5.02 lifetime vs. Braves). Sunday, RHP Greg
Maddux (17-8, 2.20; 7-2, 2.08 lifetime vs. Marlins) vs. LHP Jesus
Sanchez (6-8, 4.68; 1-1, 2.70 lifetime vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   Series history: Atlanta leads the all-time series 38-31 but is
3-4 against them this season.
</P>
<P>
   Past meetings: The Marlins might wind up the worst NL team in
three decades. Atlanta took two of three games at home June 16-18
but then dropped three of a four-game set at Pro Player Stadium
July 9-12, when the Marlins beat Denny Neagle, Greg Maddux and Tom
Glavine.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: The worst team in the majors. The Marlins, with 98
losses, have lost 12 of their last 13 games and have gone 4-22
since Aug. 12. They not only will become the first reigning world
championship team to lose 100 games but also will hit the century
mark faster than any expansion team. ... They already have endured
two 11-game losing streaks. Florida has a chance to record the
worst record by an NL team since 1970. The 1976 Montreal Expos went
55-107. ... Nevertheless, this is a big week in franchise history.
With president Don Smiley withdrawing his bid to purchase the club,
he left the table to south Florida commodities trader John Henry,
who has pledged to build a new stadium out of his own pocket if
local authorities don't want to help out.

 &HT;    No gain for Gamecocks
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. -- Four years ago, the Georgia and South Carolina
football programs seemed headed in opposite directions.
</P>
<P>
   The Gamecocks appeared ready to soar under new coach Brad Scott,
the architect of Florida State's high-octane offense in the
Seminoles' national championship season of 1993. At Georgia, the
turmoil was building after a 5-6 season under Ray Goff.
</P>
<P>
   When the Bulldogs and Gamecocks meet in Saturday's SEC opener at
Williams-Brice Stadium, they still appear headed in different
directions _ but the roles are reversed.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, under third-year coach Jim Donnan, is ranked 15th
nationally and has won 11 of its last 13 games. Last season, Donnan
led the Bulldogs to a 10-2 record and a No. 10 ranking in his
second year in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina, meanwhile, is 23-22-1 in four-plus seasons under
Scott and no longer confident of moving into the upper echelon of
the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I look at our base and foundation that was built, I feel
real good about it,'' said Mike McGee, South Carolina athletics
director. ``While we may be a step behind Georgia at this point,
within a year or two, we have an opportunity. (But) the proof's
still in the pudding.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``proof'' is that the Gamecocks were 7-5 in Scott's first
season in 1994 but have a losing record since.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd think going into your fifth year that your program would
be further along,'' Scott said. ``I imagine every coach in America
who takes a job, in the back of his mind says, 'Hey, five years'
time, I think I'll have this program as good as any of them.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But Georgia's been a consistent winner in this league for 50
years. South Carolina hasn't been there yet. I think they're
different jobs. Some programs you go into to maintain a certain
level and other jobs, such as South Carolina, you go in to build a
program in the toughest conference in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Things probably won't get much better for the Gamecocks this
season. Only six of 22 starters are seniors, and they have one of
the smallest defensive fronts and inexperienced offensive lines in
the SEC. The future looks more auspicious, with 51 freshmen or
sophomores on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came here, I thought that we'd be competing for a bowl
every year,'' senior wide receiver Zola Davis said. ``We got one my
first year, but we haven't gotten one since. ... Something seems to
happen every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of South Carolina's problems can be attributed to three
areas: recruiting, injuries and defense.
</P>
<P>
   Scott got a late start in his first recruiting effort _ he had
only a month to recruit after coaching his final game at FSU, so
the Gamecocks signed only 18 players. He also took several academic
risks in his first two seasons _ nine of his first 46 signees at
South Carolina failed to academically qualify. South Carolina isn't
exactly a breeding ground for abundant talent, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the (high school) talent is better in Georgia
than South Carolina, but you don't have to be a mathematician to
figure out that (Georgia's larger population) gives you about four
times as many high schools and four times as many at-bats when you
get into recruiting,'' Scott said. ``I think that's what makes
Georgia, Florida and some of those other jobs outstanding job
potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Following last year's 5-6 season, in which the Gamecocks lost
linebacker Darren Hambrick in the opener and quarterback Anthony
Wright for the final two games because of injury, Scott shook up
his coaching staff. He hired former Clemson assistant Chuck Reedy
as his offensive coordinator and former Alabama aide Woody McCorvey
to coach receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Reedy, who coordinated Danny Ford's run-oriented offenses at
Clemson and more recently was the head coach at Baylor, has
simplified South Carolina's offense because of three redshirt
freshmen starting on the offensive line. Scott also has stopped
wearing headsets on the sidelines, in effect relinquishing complete
control to Reedy and defensive coordinator Wally Burnham, something
he didn't do in seasons past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to stay out of the conversation is don't get in
it,'' Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   But South Carolina's defense is still one of the most-talked
about subjects in Columbia. The Gamecocks surrendered 179 yards on
the ground in their 38-20 win over Ball State in last week's
opener.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina is small and thin along its defensive front, and
will face a stiff challenge this week in containing Bulldogs
quarterback Quincy Carter and Georgia's deep corps of running
backs.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, a 6-foot-3, 225-pound freshman, completed 12 of 16
passes for 235 yards and three TDs in his debut. He is the nation's
top-rated passer.

 &HT;    Brooks upgrades Falcons' `D'
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years ago, St. Louis rang up 59 points against the Falcons
in the infamous ``no arms'' debacle at the RCA Dome.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams' coach was one Rich Brooks, who had no idea at the time
that the same defense his offense exploited to the point of a 59-16
humiliation would be his responsibility to fix the next season.
</P>
<P>
   What Brooks saw that Sunday afternoon was ugly from a distance
and downright horrifying up close. The Falcons allowed big plays
with impunity and St. Louis ball carriers ran through their token
attempts to bring them down. Linebacker Cornelius Bennett said
afterward: ``We tackled like we had no arms.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have stayed in Atlanta,'' running back Jamal
Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the low point of a season with many of them. If one game
indicated that the Falcons' defense needed a major overhaul, that
embarrassment was it. At the same time, ironically, the impressive
performance by the Rams contributed to Brooks' ouster as head coach
after the season.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis young talent _ quarterback Tony Banks and receiver
Eddie Kennison _ flourished in that game, displaying the ability
and explosiveness projected of it. However, the Rams never reached
that type of efficiency again, and, really, how could they? But
because they showed so much against Atlanta and so little the rest
of the season, someone had to take the blame.
</P>
<P>
   That someone turned out to be Brooks, who had left a sparkling
17-year head-coaching career at Oregon for the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   Although St. Louis won more games in his two years there than in
the previous seven, he was fired, and Dick Vermeil was lured out of
retirement after 14 years. The dismissal was difficult for Brooks
to take. After all, he had only two years on the job. ``And I
thought we were going in the right direction,'' he said. ``I was
disappointed that I wasn't able to see it through. I would have
liked more time.''
</P>
<P>
   That's Brooks' polite way of saying he got jobbed. ``In St.
Louis, they hadn't won in so long that I felt a change in attitude
was necessary, as well as getting good young people who could be
productive,'' he said. ``All those changes weren't good, and I
didn't have control over all those changes. But you end up being
responsible for all of them anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, June Junes was shown the door in Atlanta, and Dan
Reeves was replaced as coach of the New York Giants. Reeves knew of
Brooks from his Giants defensive coordinator Mike Nolan, who played
under Brooks at Oregon. Reeves called Brooks for advice about the
vacant St. Louis job. Brooks told Reeves he'd be interested in
working for him with any team other than the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   So when the Falcons hired Reeves, he recalled the complimentary
words Nolan said about Brooks, the way the Rams played under him
and Brooks' interest in working under Reeves. Reeves called. St.
Louis' loss was Atlanta's gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of respect for Rich,'' Reeves said. ``He's very
honest and clearly can work with anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves hired defensive line coach Bill Kollar, linebackers coach
Don Blackmon and secondary coach Ron Meeks before he hired Brooks.
It could have been a risky deal, hiring a defensive coordinator who
had been a head coach for the previous 20 years and placing him
over three assistants he did not know.
</P>
<P>
   But Reeves said it could not have worked out better. The
Falcons' defense has improved drastically, and the defensive
coaches work in harmony.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most amazing thing is that those guys never worked
together before,'' Reeves said. ``The defense has gotten better
probably faster than I thought. I give the defensive coaches a lot
of room to coach. Rich was used to being a head coach, but he's
done a great job for us.''
</P>
<P>
   In Brooks' first season as assistant head coach and defensive
coordinator, the Falcons' defense improved in every category from
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Brooks wants more. ``I'm proud of what the players and
coaches did,'' he said, ``but we still gave up far too many points.
If you want to win in this league, you have to be a solid defensive
team. How you get there is really not as important as getting
there. There were too many major breakdowns.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks sized up the Falcons and came to the conclusion that he
wanted more aggressiveness. He wanted to attack more, to force the
issue at times and to exploit opponents' weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons used to play mostly three-deep coverage, which was
more reactive than attacking. Brooks' unit plays bump-and-run on
receivers. It utilizes the ``zone dog'' scheme that made
Pittsburgh's defense so daunting but still plays zone coverage
behind it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before coach Brooks,'' Kollar said, ``we never pressed the
wide receivers. Now we do, and it's taken away the `gimme' out pass
on the three-step drop. That was there all day. Now, we use a
combination of coverages. We still run a lot of the same stuff from
before, but we're more aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the old Falcons defense, Brooks said: ``You could look at the
film and see that there was confusion, coverage-wise.''
</P>
<P>
   Which about sums up Brooks' stint in St. Louis. Turns out that
when he was hired away from Oregon, the Rams' hierarchy sought a
quick fix instead of building a solid, young team through the draft
and wise free-agent signings. Brooks got run off before he could
impose his personality on the team.
</P>
<P>
   And for the first time in 20 years, he was not a team's head
coach, a change that Brooks described by saying, ``I don't know if
I'd say it was smooth.'' But he made it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps that we have some great players, some very good
players and some good players who all want to work hard and get
better,'' Brooks said. ``And the coaches I work with are all great.
They're good teachers and put their guys in positions to play
fundamental defense. You do that and you should be able to play
decent defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Brooks' major adjustments from head coach to coordinator
was watching the game from the coach's box, high above the action.
``I hadn't been up there in 20 years,'' he said. ``When I first
went up there here in Atlanta, I thought I had to get my eyes
adjusted because it's up in the sky. But, really, it was a little
disconcerting because I wasn't used to watching from that
perspective above the action. But it's the best place to call a
game.''
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis firing hardly has given Brooks reason to call off
his ambition to be an NFL head coach. It did leave him a bit
miffed, however. Asked what he took from the Rams experience, he
paused and said, ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he said, ``I'd like another opportunity, for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   That could come later. The mission at hand is the Falcons. Yet,
among the satisfactions Brooks has received was Atlanta going into
St. Louis last year and winning, 27-21.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just say I was excited that we won there,'' he said.
``I'll leave it at that.

 &HT;    Local kids get chance to play with the Tiger
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Tiger Woods Foundation's Junior Golf Clinic and Exhibition
Sunday at Browns Mill Golf Course is the main event for three days
of activities in Atlanta with an emphasis on inner-city youth and
minority golf.
</P>
<P>
   The Woods Foundation's fourth clinic of 1998, 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.,
although officially closed to the public, will be attended by about
3,000 children from local youth organizations _ about 25 of whom
will receive hands-on instruction from the 1997 Masters champion.
Another 100 youngsters will be taught by other instructors.
</P>
<P>
   The clinic, co-sponsored by American Golf, will feature both
Tiger and his father Earl and will include a tribute to Atlanta
native Tup Holmes, who played an integral role in the desegregation
of public golf in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Monday at 5:30 p.m., Woods will strike the first ball in the
official opening of the Charlie Yates Golf Course, new home of the
East Lake Junior Golf Academy. The course will be open for public
play in mid-October with greens fees at about $28.
</P>
<P>
   Two Tiger Woods Foundation events are open to the public _ a
community golf workshop Saturday, 9 a.m.-1 p.m., at the Southeast
Recreation Center, 355 Cleveland Ave., across from Brown's Mill;
and a ``Sharing and Caring with Earl Woods`` program Sunday, 7-9
p.m., at the First Congregational Church, UCC, 105 Courtland St.
</P>
<P>
   The community golf workshops _ sponsored by Golf Digest, Nike,
the National Minority Golf Foundation and the Urban League _ will
include discussions on ``golf etiquette, the business of golf and
how to prepare for youth employment opportunities.``
</P>
<P>
   The Woods Foundation also will hold a benefit auction, 6-8 p.m.
Saturday, at the All-Star Cafe on Peachtree Street.
</P>
<P>
   In a related event, the East Lake Community Foundation and the
Atlanta History Center are debuting a traveling exhibition,
``Playing Through: African-American Golf in Georgia,'' today at
East Lake Golf Club, coinciding with the National Minority Golf
Foundation's Southeast Regional Minority Golf Symposium today and
Saturday at the Westin Atlanta Airport Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' clinic and exhibition comes to Atlanta after previous
summer visits to St. Louis, Detroit and Portland, Ore., moving to
Louisville later this month. The Woods Foundation said it makes the
clinic an invitation-only event and closes it to the public ``out
of concern for the safety of the children and all others
involved.`` The attending children are from Atlanta schools, parks
and recreation groups, community and junior golf organizations.
</P>
<P>
   American Golf, which operates several Atlanta area courses, is
sponsoring a $1 million hole-in-one shot by Woods during the
clinic. If successful, the $1 million will be donated to local
junior golf and inner-city youth programs. American Golf is
providing attending children with certificates to play a round of
golf for $1 during off-peak hours at its courses in the Atlanta
area.

 &HT;    Major drama unfolding on women's side
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Who'll stop the reign at the U.S. Open?
</P>
<P>
   Jana Novotna can today if she beats Martina Hingis, who is
defending not just her tournament title here but also the No. 1
ranking in women's tennis, a position she's held for 75 straight
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But don't count out the champion. The self-assuredness that's
been missing from Hingis' game all summer reappeared this week
after an impressive quarterfinal victory over Monica Seles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still No. 1,'' Hingis said, ``so don't take that away from
me yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's semifinals bring together the four hottest players on
the WTA Tour: Hingis, the No. 1 seed; Novotna, the Wimbledon
champion; Lindsay Davenport, on an 18-1 summer run; and Venus
Williams, the top gate attraction of the four.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis has beaten Novotna in four of their last five meetings,
but Novotna won the most recent one 6-4, 6-4 in a Wimbledon
semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want that revenge back,'' Hingis said. ``It's a different
surface, and I think I'm also a different player again.''
</P>
<P>
   If Novotna wins, Hingis' reign at No. 1 will end, although
Novotna says that winning her first U.S. Open title would mean more
to her than usurping Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a great possibility for me to become the No. 1
player,'' Novotna said, ``but it is not like a major, major goal in
my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Major goal or not, Novotna can achieve it by beating Hingis
today, then Davenport in Saturday's final. Novotna also will be No.
1 if Williams is her final opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport, who has lost just 16 games in her five matches here,
can become the No. 1 player if she beats Novotna in the final.
First, she must stop Williams. Davenport has won two of three from
her this year, all three-setters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm playing well, I'm going to win it,'' said Davenport,
who is 0-3 in Grand Slam semifinals. ``I've done everything I can
up to this point to win this tournament.''

SCHUMER VIEWED AS RELENTLESS, AMBITIOUS LEGISLATOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SUSAN SACHS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When he decided 17 months ago to formally enter the
Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate, Rep. Charles Schumer
brought with him ample reserves of the frenetic energy that has
both irritated and impressed his Washington colleagues, a recurring
role as vocal gadfly to the Republicans who have run the House of
Representatives since 1994, and a substantial legislative record.
</P>
<P>
   And while he could count on good name recognition in his
district, which encompasses parts of Brooklyn and Queens, Schumer
worried that the rest of New York's voters did not connect him to
the laws he helped bring to life, and he devised an aggressive
advertising campaign to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest battle I had to face,'' he said, ``was getting
people to pay attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Former aides, political associates and congressional observers
said that getting people to pay attention is a skill that Schumer
long ago mastered and added that he has been smart and relentless
in the way he pursues publicity and in support of his signature
causes. Although some criticized Schumer as being single-mindedly
ambitious, they also praised him for using the drive born of that
ambition to get things done.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are legislators who are the darling of the press and get
a lot of attention but couldn't get a coalition together if their
lives depended on it,'' said Norman Ornstein, a fellow at the
American Enterprise Institute in Washington. ``At the other
extreme, there are people who are terrific inside players but are
uncomfortable going on TV and reaching out to make their case in a
more public way.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, he said, combines the two skills: ``It's not often that
you can get people who do both.''
</P>
<P>
   A former New York state assemblyman, Schumer was elected to
Congress in 1980, the same year that Ronald Reagan was elected
president. He was 29 years old and drew assignments on the
committee dealing with banking and housing and on the Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   During his first few terms, his colleagues said, Schumer
developed a reputation as a legislator who could forge coalitions _
not so much through charm or charisma, but by tirelessly
buttonholing fellow representatives to find the key to their
support.
</P>
<P>
   Early in his House career, Schumer drew attention by helping to
fight off a Senate attempt to cut federal housing subsidies to
cities with rent control, like New York City, and by helping to
write a major housing rehabilitation bill that included a program
modeled in part on a Brooklyn project promoting home ownership in
poor neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Schumer has concentrated more heavily on issues
relating to crime and justice, a preference that reflects not only
what was topical in New York City in the early 1990s, but also his
elevation in 1991 to the chairmanship of the crime subcommittee.
From that platform, during the final years of Democratic control of
the House, Schumer succeeded in making a few of the country's
hottest and most visible issues his own.
</P>
<P>
   After a spate of abortion clinic bombings, he sponsored the
Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, a 1994 law that made it
a federal crime to use force or intimidation to obstruct places
where abortions are performed. He played a crucial role in passage
that same year of the Violence Against Women Act, which, among
other provisions, set up a national telephone line for victims of
domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have accused Schumer of overstating his role in some of
the more high-profile bills he touts as his own. For example, his
campaign literature credits Schumer with having written the Brady
bill on gun control and the 1994 crime-control package.
</P>
<P>
   Geraldine Ferraro, the former representative and one of
Schumer's rivals for the Democratic senatorial nomination, said in
a recent interview that her understanding is that the crime bill
was not written by Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   But in a testy response to that criticism, Schumer replied:
``When you're lead sponsor of a bill, you're the author. Did I
personally write every sentence? No. I always bring in
collaborative people. It's like if you are the general contractor
and then there are subcontractors in building a building.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   People closely involved in the tortuous passage of the anticrime
bills through the House and the Senate said that Schumer played a
central role. They said he provided much of the creativity needed
to take existing proposals _ bills that had languished for years in
Congress _ and reshape them into legislation capable of attracting
broad bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, the observers said, bridged the differences between
liberal and more centrist Democrats and between Democrats and
Republicans, by melding tough law enforcement measures like an
expansion of the death penalty and increases in money for police
departments with programs like drug counseling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chuck was one of the first guys to talk about, and to put
together in the House, the notion that it doesn't need to be either
a prevention or punishment debate,'' said Andrew Fois, a Washington
lawyer who served as chief of staff for Schumer's criminal justice
subcommittee. ``He kind of broke through that rhetorical and
political rubric.''
</P>
<P>
   Together with related measures like the Brady bill, which
requires background checks and a waiting period for gun buyers, and
the fiercely contested ban on the manufacture of some types of
assault weapons, the crime package also stood out as one of the
major legislative accomplishments of President Clinton's first
term.
</P>
<P>
   While the White House and many other members of Congress were
deeply involved in getting the bills passed, Schumer shouldered
much of the responsibility for strategy-making, for hard bargaining
with recalcitrant congressmen and for public relations.
</P>
<P>
   On the assault weapons ban, which did not have the support of
the Democratic leadership, aides said that Schumer established
himself as unofficial whip and organized the canvassing of his
colleagues and marshaling of votes.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's high profile on gun control issues has made him a
political nemesis of the National Rifle Association, a fact he
seems to relish and often points to as proof that he will not be
bullied in public life. Indeed, colleagues said, the lobbying
group's enmity is a political gift to a congressman with Schumer's
constituency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chuck picks good enemies,'' said a political associate who
spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``He's got the NRA not only as
an enemy, but it's a showcase enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Democrats lost control of the House in 1994, Schumer
lost his subcommittee chairmanship and a ready platform for
introducing initiatives. He first recast himself as leader of the
minority's defensive line against Speaker Newt Gingrich's
conservative agenda and was engaged in fighting off what he
described as the majority's attempts to weaken the crime laws.
</P>
<P>
   While he said he draws some satisfaction in ``stopping bad
things,'' Schumer feels keenly the loss of his status in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the House structure, if Newt Gingrich doesn't like it, it
just doesn't get to the floor,'' he said in explaining why some of
his more recent proposals on eliminating racial bias in mortgage
lending and increasing penalties for interstate weapons trafficking
have advanced no further than the press-release stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been able to get things done, but not close to the number
of things I'd like to get done,'' Schumer added. ``I think I could
get much more done as a senator.''

 &HT;    Laettner has surgery on Achilles'
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hawks free-agent forward Christian Laettner has undergone
surgery on a ruptured Achilles' tendon suffered last Friday and
could be sidelined from three to nine months, depending on a
prognosis expected today from an Atlanta doctor.
</P>
<P>
   According to Laettner's agent, Herb Rudoy of Chicago, the 1997
NBA All-Star injured himself during a pickup game at Duke last
Thursday. Surgery was performed the next day in Durham.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rehab should be a few months,'' Rudoy said Thursday. ``I
don't know what a 'few months' mean, but that's what the first
prognosis is. It was outpatient surgery, which makes me feel good
about his recovery.'' A ruptured Achilles' is not considered
career-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the NBA-imposed lockout, Hawks officials are
restricted from commenting. Also, the team cannot have its doctors
examine or operate or offer rehab services to Laettner during the
lockout.
</P>
<P>
   The injury could not have come at a worse time for Laettner.
Based on the precedent he set, 1997-98 was a disappointing season
in which he eventually lost his starting position to Alan
Henderson. Now, with the injury and recovery period to follow,
Laettner will have to prove that he is healthy before the Hawks or
any other teams would be willing to sign him to a contract.

 &HT;    Auburn regrouping after loss in opener
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN, Ala. _ If Auburn had opened the season with Kent or The
Citadel or Northeast Louisiana, people wouldn't be asking all these
pointed questions about the 0-1 Tigers, coach Terry Bowden says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be 1-0 and looking forward to playing our second game,''
Bowden said. ``But we're not.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a breather, Auburn had an all-night struggle against
No. 12 Virginia on Sept. 3, rushing for only 18 yards on 27 carries
in a 19-0 loss. And the game wasn't that close.
</P>
<P>
   The reason that Auburn fans are nervous and asking all these
questions is that the schedule gets worse. The Tigers play Saturday
at Mississippi, followed by games with No. 7 LSU and No. 8
Tennessee at home. There there are road trips to Mississippi State
and No. 3 Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden won't say that Saturday's game at Ole Miss falls in the
``must-win'' category, but his players will. They, too, have looked
at the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hate to say it so early in the season, but Saturday's game
is really big,'' sophomore quarterback Ben Leard said. ``If we
lose, we'll be down, with a top-10 team (LSU) coming to our place
next week. We have got to come out of this game with a victory and
get some momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   Beating Ole Miss in Oxford is always a tall order, but this
particular Rebel team looks strong up front, holding Memphis to 16
yards rushing in a 30-10 win Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   That does not bode well for Bowden's new run-first offensive
philosophy, which he implemented with the departure of quarterback
Dameyune Craig. A very good Virginia defense was intent on stopping
the ground game, and when Auburn couldn't run against a stacked
defense, Leard couldn't pass them out of it.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore Demontray Carter, who was supposed to be the main man
in the running game, was hobbled with a bad ankle against the
Cavaliers and still isn't at full speed. Center Cole Cubelic, who
sat out with a stress facture, was sorely missed. Guard Mike
Pucillo broke his foot in the first half and is out for at least
six weeks. All those things combined with a quality opponent to
make it a long night at Jordan-Hare Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could not overcome a change of center, we had a tailback on
crutches the day before the game and a new quarterback (Leard),''
Bowden said. ``Against a very good team, we couldn't overcome it.''
</P>
<P>
   This week on offense, freshman Michael Burks will start at
tailback ahead of Carter. But the philosophy, said Bowden, will not
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have to make a whole lot of changes; we just have to
get better at what we do,'' Bowden said. ``We were doing some
things that weren't effective against a great defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Leard has confidence that the Auburn offense has gotten over its
first-game jitters, when the Tigers were shut out by a
non-conference opponent for the first time in 31 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing we've got to do is put the ball in the end
zone,'' said Leard, who completed 11 of 25 passes for 146 yards
against Virginia. ``Once we do that, I think a great weight will be
lifted off our shoulders. It hurt last week to invest that much
time and not get any points.''
</P>
<P>
   Leard, a native of Hartwell, said the Auburn fans he knows are
not panicking as they look ahead at the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody I talk to has been upbeat,'' he said. ``They realize
Virginia is a very good team and that we can get a lot better. They
realize that we have some tough things we have to fight through.''
</P>
<P>
   While the next five games are a competitive nightmare, Auburn's
last five games are no picnic, either. After going to Florida on
Oct. 17, the Tigers host Louisiana Tech and Tim Rattay, the man who
threw for 490 yards against Nebraska. Then it's improved Arkansas,
Central Florida and Daunte Culpepper, and the traditional wars with
Georgia and Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   That schedule, more than anything, is why Saturday's trip to Ole
Miss is so crucial. If the Tigers are going to turn their season
around, they had better start right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a soft spot on our schedule, and we knew that
coming in,'' Leard said. ``We learned a lot about our weaknesses
last week against Virginia. Now, we have to show that we can
improve.''

 &HT;    For now, Moya likes his chances on hardcourts
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York _ Carlos Moya is the first reigning French Open
champion to make the U.S. Open semifinals since Jim Courier in
1992, so he'd prefer that no one call him a clay-court specialist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a lot to prove I'm able to do well on clay and on
hardcourts,'' said Moya, who beat Magnus Larsson 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 in
Thursday's quarterfinals. ``I knew I was able to do well, but maybe
people just thought I'm only a good clay-court player.''
</P>
<P>
   Moya, whose best moment here was coming from two sets down to
beat Michael Chang, has won more than two-thirds of his career
matches on clay and was only 1-3 on hardcourts prior to the Open,
but he won't concede clay is his favorite surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask me right now, I'll say hard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mats Wilander is the last player to win the French and U.S.
opens in the same year in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Davis Cup team named
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Davis Cup team that will face Italy this month in the
semifinals will include Jim Courier, Todd Martin, Jan-Michael
Gambill and Justin Gimelstob, captain Tom Gullikson announced
Thursday. Courier skipped the U.S. Open, complaining of a ``dead
arm,'' but Gullikson is convinced he's OK. Gambill and Gimelstob
will be making their Davis Cup debuts. Atlanta's Richey Reneberg,
Martin's partner in doubles for the first two rounds, was passed
over because of a knee injury. Pete Sampras and Michael Chang have
ruled themselves out for the entire year, and Andre Agassi is
committed to attending a fundrasaiser in Las Vegas for his
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Slam for Williams sisters
</P>
<P>
   Serena Williams and Max Mirnyi won the mixed doubles final
Thursday and completed a unique Grand Slam sweep for the Williams
sisters. Venus Williams and Justin Gimelstob won the Australian and
French opens, and Serena and Mirnyi won Wimbledon and here.
</P>
<P>
   Loose points
</P>
<P>
   Martina Hingis can win the Grand Slam of women's doubles. She
won the Australian Open with Mirjana Lucic and the French Open and
Wimbledon with current partner Jana Novotna. They'll play Lindsay
Davenport and Natasha Davenport in Sunday's final. ... Kimiko Date,
the former top-10 pro and Japan's greatest player ever, is here as
a TV commentator for the Tokyo Broadcast System and was asked by
Melanie Molitor, Martina Hingis' coach and mother, to play some
practice points. Hingis thought it was a junior player and told
Molitor, ``Hey, this junior hits like Date.'' ``It is Kimiko
Date,'' Molitor said. ... Laura Granville of Chicago and Jacqueline
Trail of Paducah, Ky., are the Americans who made the girls
quarterfinals. Zach Fleishman of Playa Del Ray, Calif., is the only
American in the boys quarters.

BURNED TWICE OR NOT, WILLIAMS IS A KEEPER 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ On a depleted Jets defense that suddenly
raises questions and will tax the brainpower of even the
redoubtable defensive coordinator Bill Belichick, who is devising
schemes for Sunday's meeting with the Ravens, Kevin Williams is
trying to make his way.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is the only rookie starter on the defense. But, as he
explained Thursday, part of the job description of the free safety
is to call out the signals for the secondary.
</P>
<P>
   It also includes getting past opening-day mistakes. Obviously,
on a team that yielded more yardage in a game (557 to San
Francisco) than any Jets defense since 1988, the entire unit was
troubled last Sunday. But Coach Bill Parcells has been handling
Williams, at 23 the youngest Jet, gingerly.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells talked Thursday about the touchdown pass late in the
game on which Williams was beaten by J.J. Stokes. ``Just because he
was visible on one play,'' Parcells said, ``doesn't mean he wasn't
effective the other 64 plays.''
</P>
<P>
   And besides, Parcells said, who else does he have there? The
backup is last year's starter, Jerome Henderson. But Parcells sees
``more upside'' in Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't take a rookie out after one game,'' Parcells said.
``I can't just rattle this guy's confidence right out of the box.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells has enough worries this week with his linebackers. Only
five are left after the knee injury to the weakside linebacker
James Farrior, who will probably miss at least two games. Yet
Williams seemed calm Thursday as he contemplated the Ravens, who
possess high-quality receivers in Michael Jackson and Jermaine
Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, a third-round pick out of Oklahoma State, said he had
replayed the Stokes touchdown in his mind immediately. Williams was
playing ``center field'' and appeared to be waiting for Steve
Young's pass to come to him. Instead, Stokes leaped in front of him
for the touchdown, which put the 49ers ahead by 30-27. Williams
also reconstructed his missed tackle of Garrison Hearst, who
chugged 96 yards for the winning touchdown in overtime. Williams
had a clear shot at him at the 49ers' 20, but was straight-armed
out of the play by Hearst. The Jets had practiced tackling Hearst,
who likes to use a straight-arm tactic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about what I should have done after each play,'' the
6-foot, 190-pound Williams said. ``I should have been more
aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he added: ``Other than those two plays, I felt I did all
right. But we lost, so I don't think I did all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Williams would be able to shake the memory of his
mistakes, Parcells said: ``If it lingers, you won't be in football
too long. But I don't think he played too badly. He's a bright
young man. I wish he was a little bit bigger, but he's not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's going to be a pretty good player. That's why we
have him. Would I want the luxury of four, five games having him
part-time? Yeah. In a perfect world.'' &QL;

GE INTRODUCES FASTER MEDICAL SCANNER 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Amid much hoopla, General Electric Co. introduced a
medical scanner Thursday that it says captures images of the inner
workings of a patient's body in seconds, not minutes.
</P>
<P>
   GE expects to sell about 400 of the new CT (for computed
tomography) scanners a year, at $1.25 million each _ barely a
top-line ripple for a company that had $90.8 billion in revenues
last year.
</P>
<P>
   But, it is the first GE product made with the much ballyhooed
Six Sigma process for reducing defects, and at an hourlong news
conference in New York, GE chairman John Welch positioned it as a
huge symbolic stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``This scanner lets customers see and touch the results of Six
Sigma themselves,'' Welch said.
</P>
<P>
   Six Sigma involves analyzing every step in designing,
manufacturing or using a product or process. The method brings all
parties to the product or process _ customers, engineers, line
workers or back-office clerks.
</P>
<P>
   Welch said that applying Six Sigma methods to internal processes
had increased GE's operating margins to 16 percent from 14 percent.

 &HT;    Top Texas Democrats put Clinton at arm's length
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Two top Texas Democrats moved away from their embattled
president on Thursday, with one indicating resignation might be the
best way out and the other saying he would not make campaign
appearances with Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The harshest words in Texas came from a scion of one of the most
revered Democratic families in the state's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he wants the nation's forgiveness, I think it is more
readily given to a former president than a sitting one,'' said Paul
Hobby, the Democratic candidate for state comptroller and son of
former Lt. Gov. Bill Hobby and the grandson of former Gov. William
Hobby.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also took a verbal broadside from State Comptroller John
Sharp, who is locked in a tight battle for lieutenant governor with
Republican Rick Perry.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp made it clear he has no use for Clinton and the turmoil he
has caused.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am deeply disappointed in this entire process and the whole
series of events on all sides in this matter,'' Sharp said. ``I
don't plan to be with the president if he comes to Texas. That has
a lot less to do with politics and a whole lot more to do with the
fact that I don't care to explain it any more to my children.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Democratic gubernatorial candidate Garry Mauro, Clinton's
top supporter in Texas, had discouraging _ though supportive _
words for his longtime friend. ``I'm embarrassed for the president.
I'm embarrassed for the country. I'm personally angry with the
president,'' Mauro said in Laredo. ``But I've been the president's
friend and Hillary's friend since 1972 and when times are tough
your friends are supposed to stick by you. I'm sticking by the
president and the first family.''
</P>
<P>
   While Mauro has been closely aligned with Clinton _ serving as
chairman of his presidential campaigns here _ Texas Democrats like
Sharp and Hobby have never been closely identified with the
president, who failed to carry the state in his two races.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Clinton should resign, Hobby said, ``The nation should
not suffer through impeachment proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   Hobby said that as a father, he is furious that he can't watch
TV news with his three young children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hold Clinton personally responsible for that,'' he said,
adding that his children have asked questions ``that kids under 10
years old should not have to ask.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauro said he is still counting on Clinton to headline
fund-raising events in San Antonio and Houston on Sept. 27. The
Clintons have been top money-raisers for Mauro's uphill battle
against Republican Gov. George W. Bush, who has offered a
wait-and-see-the-facts response to questions about whether Clinton
should leave office.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Richard Raymond, the Democrats' candidate for land
commissioner, is taking the same tack on questions about whether he
wants to be on stage with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what's in that report . . . but if I don't like
what I see, I don't want my standing up there with him to be seen
as supporting what he did _ and I won't be there,'' Raymond said.
</P>
<P>
   At least one Texas Democratic congressional candidate said
Thursday he has seen enough. It's time for Clinton to go away, said
Ben B. Boothe of Fort Worth, who is challenging incumbent
Republican Joe Barton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton's deal is regrettable. . . . It is a drag on the
ticket,'' Boothe said. ``I believe he should resign. He is as much
of a liability on the ticket today as Richard Nixon was in the
Watergate area. This thing should go away as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Loy Sneary of Bay City, running against Republican U.S.
Rep. Ron Paul in a district that includes the eastern portion of
Williamson County and a sliver of Travis County, wants to see the
report before passing judgment. Clinton, Sneary said, is not an
issue in his race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've not had anyone really ask me about that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul has called for Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The pointed remarks from some Democratic candidates came despite
the party's Texas chairwoman's claim that resignation talk ``is
premature since no one has seen the report.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Democratic Chairwoman Molly Beth Malcolm said Clinton's
woes won't hurt Texas candidates in November. But Texas GOP
Chairwoman Susan Weddington said her party's candidates will
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a party is in disarray because of a lack of moral
leadership it does have a depressing effect on the members of that
party,'' she said. ``That could be reflected in voter turnout.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Republicans, sensing momentum moving their way, see no
need to pile on Clinton. Bush and the other top GOP candidates do
not plan on hammering on the president today when the slate begins
a three-day swing through the state billed as the ``Victory '98''
tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we will be hearing about character and integrity and
all the issues George Bush and Rick Perry have been talking about
for a long time,'' said Perry, state agriculture commissioner and
the GOP's candidate for lieutenant governor. ``It doesn't have
anything to do with any reports or what is going on in
Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Carole Keeton Rylander, Hobby's Republican opponent for
comptroller, said she's not going to be talking about the scandal.
``I'm going to be talking about the issues. . . . Integrity,
character and honesty are important, but I'm not going to be
talking about the Washington scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said for months that he wanted to see more facts prior
to passing judgment on Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think America needs to wait and see how it plays out,'' he
said in East Texas this week.

ANKLE SPRAIN DOESNT SLOW ARMSTEAD'S RESOLVE TO PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By STEVE POPPER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ While his teammates ran through drills
on different parts of the Meadowlands practice field Thursday,
Jessie Armstead stood behind them, limping as he lined up rows of
padded obstacles, gingerly trying to push himself into motion,
despite the pain in his sprained right ankle.
</P>
<P>
   The pain was evident, but for Armstead it was a step forward
after two days of not being able to run at all. And it was
encouraging enough that he insisted that he would be on the field
when the Giants take on the Oakland Raiders on Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm banking everything,'' Armstead said. ``I'm going to go out
there and give what I got to play. I want to play. I look forward
to playing the football game. I don't look forward to standing on
the sideline. I haven't missed a game since 1990. I'm going to go
out, regardless. If it's going to give out, you want it to give out
in a game.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Armstead, the Giants' weakside linebacker now in his sixth
season, has never missed a game in the National Football League. He
last missed a game during his sophomore season at the University of
Miami when he tore up his knee. So a sprain was not about to stop
his streak now, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Armstead had no feeling in the ankle last Sunday when he
believed it was broken. He injured it late in the third quarter of
the Giants' season-opening victory over the Washington Redskins
when his teammate Chad Bratzke was shoved into him and rolled onto
Armstead's ankle. Armstead immediately grabbed the ankle and left
the game, but he returned in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Armstead, who earned a spot in the Pro Bowl last year, does not
want to sit out on Sunday, and the Giants do not want him to
either. Already without Jason Sehorn for the season, they are
anxiously awaiting decisions on both Armstead and strongside
linebacker Marcus Buckley, who is listed as probable with a bruised
hip. If Armstead cannot go, Scott Galyon, who already plays a
significant amount in the team's nickel defense, will make his
first career start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have confidence in Scottie,'' Armstead said. ``But,
hopefully I can play in the game. I'm going to try to be back as
soon as possible. I haven't missed a game. That's my main thing. I
want to go out there and help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was broken when it happened,'' Armstead said of
the ankle. ``It was numb. But it feels a little better now. When it
happened, I had no hope of even running any more. I just started
today my first day back jogging. Tomorrow I'll do a little cutting
and, if that goes OK, we'll go from there.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Giants Coach Jim Fassel said: ``Jessie feels a lot better. He
can run, do a little cutting and all that stuff on it today. We'll
see how he feels again tomorrow. If he gets warmed up and if he can
do some things tomorrow, then he will. But I'm fairly confident
that that will come around.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstead knows the risks, the potential of more time on the
sideline if he pushes too hard and reinjures the ankle. He has
undergone ice and electrical stimulation treatments four or five
times a day and has spent most of his time studying the mental part
of the game for Sunday. But just as he gritted his way through the
pain as he ran on the side of the field Thursday, he shrugged off
suggestions that he might be better served with additional rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a concern right now,'' Armstead said. ``It could be
better to take a week off. We've got bigger games on down the line.
I'm willing to roll the dice. I don't like being on the sideline,
period. I'm quite sure if I'm not up to full strength, the doctors
won't want me going out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to have the last decision on that. I'm going to try
to make the smartest decision I can make. But, on the other hand,
I've got a lot of guys here that depend on me, and as a team I feel
like everybody should go out there. I can tolerate pain. That's one
thing I can do.'' &QL;

WHITEWATER APPEARS TO BE A DEAD ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs for inserts and some rewriting; grafs 5, 6, 8, 9, 21 and
22 contain changes.) (lh) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The report to Congress from the independent
counsel, whose inquiry began four years ago with an examination of
a complicated land deal called Whitewater and extended to
investigations involving the White House travel office and the
administration's use of FBI files, finds no offense by President
Clinton in any of those areas that would merit impeachment, lawyers
with knowledge of the report's content said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The report, the lawyers said, does draw parallels between the
president's conduct in the investigation of his relationship with
Monica Lewinsky and the Arkansas aspects of the inquiry. Indeed, it
was the argument of the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, that
there were parallels, that gained him jurisdiction eight months ago
to investigate a possible cover-up of Clinton's relationship with
the White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   But the report's section on impeachment charges _ obstruction of
justice, perjury, witness tampering and abuse of power _ is
grounded solely in Clinton's relationship to Ms. Lewinsky and his
response to questions about it raised in a civil lawsuit, the
lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair to conclude that those other areas do not rise to
the threshhold of an impeachable offense,'' said John Bates, a
former deputy independent counsel in the Whitewater inquiry. ``It
wouldn't make sense for the independent counsel to send two reports
to Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Allies of the independent counsel said Thursday that the fact
that the report will be largely silent on the first three years of
the inquiry, before the Lewinsky matter, meant only that the
prosecutors had discovered no impeachable offenses in the many
areas long under investigation by both Starr and his predecessor as
the Whitewater independent counsel, Robert Fiske. In other words,
there is not likely to be a subsequent impeachment report to
Congress dealing with these other issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair to conclude that those other areas do not rise to
the threshold of an impeachable offense,'' said John Bates, a
former deputy independent counsel in the Whitewater inquiry. ``It
wouldn't make sense for the independent counsel to send two reports
to Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   While Starr is required to submit a final report on all aspects
of his inquiry to a special court and he could still be critical of
the White House for its handling of those matters, the filing of
the impeachment report signals that after years of examination,
those avenues of inquiry may soon close.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his supporters have long accused Starr of straying
too far from his original mandate. That the impeachment report
relies almost exclusively on the Lewinsky episode and ignores whole
areas of the long investigation is almost certain to be seized upon
by some Clinton allies as evidence that the independent counsel has
no real case to make other than one involving private matters that
would not ordinarily be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of Starr noted Thursday that he had taken on all
new areas of inquiry only with the approval of Attorney General
Janet Reno. They also pointed to the narrow focus of the
impeachment charges as a sign that Starr had conducted a fair
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have spent four years examining whether the
efforts by the President and Mrs. Clinton to suppress embarrassing
details of their old financial dealings with the owners of a
corrupt savings and loan association _ in particular, their
investment in the Whitewater real-estate development _ amounted to
a criminal cover-up or simply reflected an acceptable exercise in
political damage control.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, a federal grand jury in Arkansas completed a 30-month
review of the matter by filing a single indictment, a criminal
contempt case against Susan McDougal, one of the Clintons' business
partners in the Whitewater land venture and an operator of the
bank, the Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan of Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   The Arkansas phase of the investigation resulted in several
criminal convictions, including those of Mrs. McDougal and her
husband, James; Jim Guy Tucker, the governor who succeeded CLinton,
and David Hale, a former local judge, on fraud and other charges.
</P>
<P>
   The convictions were a mixed blessing. They forced some
recalcitrant defendants to cooperate and provide new information
about the Clintons. But they also made it difficult for prosecutors
to build a case against the president and first lady based largely
on the testimony of felons.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has faced other hurdles. Mrs. McDougal refused to answer
questions. McDougal died in jail. Hale has come under a new inquiry
for his finances. Tucker's cooperation was described by other
witnesses as only moderately helpful.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The inquiry was begun in January 1994 by Fiske, the original
Whitewater prosecutor. He was appointed at a time when the
independent counsel law had lapsed, however, and in August a court
panel refused to reappoint him, naming Starr, a former solicitor
general under President Bush, in his place.
</P>
<P>
   Starr began his inquiry on Aug. 5, 1994, when the court
instructed him to investigate whether crimes were committed
``relating in any way to James B. McDougal's, President William
Jefferson Clinton's or Mrs. Hillary Rodham Clinton's relationship
with Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association, Whitewater
Development Corp., or Capital Management Services,'' the company
controlled by Hale.
</P>
<P>
   Hale had said that Clinton asked him to make an improper
federally backed loan, some of which wound up in a Whitewater
account. Under oath, the president has denied Hale's accusation.
</P>
<P>
   While the court order appeared to focus on a rather discreet
area, it also included a clause that granted Starr broad latitude.
It said Starr also had jurisdiction to investigate serious crimes
that may have been committed ``by any person or entity developed
during the independent counsel's investigation referred to above
and connected with or arising out of that investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before Starr's appointment, Fiske had already expanded the
inquiry, deciding to investigate Webster Hubbell, a close friend of
the president's and a former Arkansas law partner of Mrs.
Clinton's, on suspicion of stealing money from his former law firm
and clients at the Rose Law Firm. Hubbell ultimately pleaded guilty
to two felony counts of fraud and tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, in seeking jurisdiction to investigate the
president's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, Starr argued that
efforts by Clinton's friend Vernon Jordan to find the former intern
a job paralleled earlier efforts by the president's allies,
including Jordan, to help Hubbell in exchange for silence.
</P>
<P>
   That was not the only time that the attorney general approved an
expansion of Starr's mandate. In 1996, she agreed to expand the
inquiry to include an examination of whether two Arkansas bankers
had improperly funneled money into one of Clinton's campaigns for
governor. The bankers were ultimately acquitted on some of the
charges, and prosecutors agreed to drop the remaining case.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Reno also approved an expansion of the inquiry to include a
look at the circumstances surrounding the dismissal of the White
House travel office and the role Mrs. Clinton played in the affair.
And in the summer of 1996, she asked the special court overseeing
the independent counsel to expand his authority to examine whether
any laws had been broken by the White House's possession of
hundreds of FBI personnel files on Republicans, both prominent and
obscure.
</P>
<P>
   Those inquiries have yielded no indictments.

CALIFORNIA JOINS THE SIMULCASTING AGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A trip to Boise, Idaho, last weekend reminded this
Californian how far behind the times our state has fallen when it
comes to wagering on out-of-town horse races.
</P>
<P>
   At Les Bois Park, a small fairgrounds track with a corrugated
metal facade, peeling banisters and sun-baked weeds in the infield,
a plain but serviceable simulcast center offers full racing
programs from as many as 17 U.S. thoroughbred, quarterhorse and
greyhound tracks, literally hundreds of betting opportunities a
day.
</P>
<P>
   Late on a Friday afternoon, action and odds from eight tracks at
once were displayed on a row of overhead television screens, and
patrons ignored the set on which Mark McGwire was swinging for No.
60.
</P>
<P>
   This was Idaho, mind you, which hasn't produced a champion since
Gary Stevens rode his first winner at Les Bois in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in California, home of some of the nation's classiest
live racing, our conservative gambling laws have restricted the
simulcast menu to in-state tracks (Bay Meadows, Golden Gate Fields,
the fairs), non-U.S. tracks (in Canada, Hong Kong, Australia) and a
handful of stakes races from other states. We're old-fashioned.
</P>
<P>
   But the gap between California and progressive states like
Nevada, Pennsylvania and even Idaho is about to be narrowed.
Starting Jan. 1, under a bill signed into law recently by Gov. Pete
Wilson, tracks here may offer up to 20 out-of-state simulcast races
on ``live'' racing days and, theoretically, an unlimited number on
dark days.
</P>
<P>
   The chance to follow the horses on major circuits in Kentucky,
New York and Florida will represent a long first step in the right
direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're entering new territory here,'' said Michael ``Roxy''
Roxborough, the influential Las Vegas oddsmaker who is a big racing
fan. ``But all we're really doing is entering the 20th century when
the 21st is about to begin.''
</P>
<P>
   Roxborough's advice is to give the customers what they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``And what they want,'' he said Wednesday after the closing-day
races at Del Mar, ``is to not be limited in the number of races
they can bet on.''
</P>
<P>
   But the challenge for racing executives is more complicated than
that. For one thing, unlike Idaho, Pennsylvania and trackless
Nevada, we have first-rate live racing. It would be possible here
to have too much simulcasting.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're just presenting more of the same bad product, that
won't make sense,'' said Norm Towne, executive director of the
Federation of California Racing Associations. ``I think presenting
a higher-quality program, in a better-orchestrated fashion, will be
better than just kind of throwing everything at the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, months before the new law was signed, the
California Horse Racing Board appointed a committee of industry
leaders and fans to recommend improvements in the state's simulcast
product and facilities. The committee has come up with some good
recommendations, including presenting the out-of-state races on a
single TV channel, with one or two hosts helping fans follow along
(``It's two minutes to post at Aqueduct. And look at that trifecta
payoff at Gulfstream! And please note a change in the track
condition at Keeneland...'').
</P>
<P>
   The hardest part might be getting California execs to agree on
which out-of-state tracks to import. Fans, presumably, would howl
if a particular circuit were abandoned just as they'd gotten to
know the horses, jockeys, trainers and trends there.
</P>
<P>
   Another puzzle is what to do about the time-zone differences.
East Coast races might start at 10 a.m. here. How many Del Mar fans
will want to get to the track next summer four hours before the
first live race?
</P>
<P>
   The advisory panel's recommendations are going to the CHRB's
Simulcast Operations Committee chaired by Robert Tourtelot. That
committee's hearings are open for public input. Hearing schedules
are available from the CHRB at (916) 263-6000 and on the internet
(chrb.ca.gov).
</P>
<P>
   Even with public input and a lot of meetings, Towne said, ``it
will be a little bit experimental in the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Going like 60: The 60th season of Los Angeles County Fair racing
began Thursday at Fairplex Park in Pomona, offering races of
limited quality but exposing stray carnival-goers to the sport.
</P>
<P>
   At an exhibit booth near the grandstand entrance, drawings are
being held for free $2 win tickets on every horse in every race.
The first race on which the drawing was conducted Thursday was won
by a horse paying $98.60.
</P>
<P>
   The La Verne woman with the winning ticket will be a fan for
life. Either that or she'll quit while she's ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Fairplex racing will be held every day through Sept. 27, the day
of the meet's big race, the $100,000 Ralph M. Hinds Pomona
Invitational Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   Jockey Victor Espinoza and trainer Mel Stute are shooting for
their third straight Fairplex championships. &QL;

DISCOUNT BROKERAGE AGREES TO $7 MILLION IN FINES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SHARON R. KING    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A discount brokerage firm and three of its
executives, including its founder and chairman, agreed Thursday to
pay $7 million in fines to settle federal allegations of fraudulent
sales practices and use of misleading advertising and promotional
literature.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a coordinated settlement of charges brought by the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Olde Discount Corp., a Detroit-based brokerage
firm, agreed to pay a $4 million civil penalty to the SEC to settle
allegations that the firm's compensation, production, hiring and
training practices encouraged brokers to lie to customers, as well
as to engage in unauthorized and unsuitable trading in customer
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Ernest Olde, the firm's former president and chairman, was fined
an additional $1 million by the SEC, which accused him of failure
to supervise. Stanley Snider, Olde's former director of national
sales, was ordered to pay $100,000, and Daniel Katzman, a former
Olde regional manager, was order to pay $50,000. They were accused
of playing roles in inducing and causing the violations.
</P>
<P>
   The case is the first in which the SEC has held a brokerage firm
directly liable for its brokers' fraudulent sales practices, said
Richard Murphy, a senior trial counsel with the commission's
Atlanta office.
</P>
<P>
   In settling the charges, the firm, Olde, Snider and Katzman
neither admitted nor denied the charges. Lawyers for the firm, Olde
and Katzman were said by others at their firms to be unavailable
for comment. Snider's lawyer, Bruce Hiler, a partner at O'Melveny &AMP;
Myers in Washington, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, Snider and Katzman are barred from
association with any broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer,
investment adviser or investment company for five years. Olde faces
a one-year suspension.
</P>
<P>
   The brokerage firm was also fined $1.35 million by NASD
Regulation Inc., the regulatory arm of the NASD, which accused it
of using and distributing improper advertising. Olde was fined
$500,000 and suspended from the securities industry for 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Olde issued a statement saying the settlement built on a series
of initiatives it began on its own more than three years ago. Those
actions include changes in management, compensation structure,
enhanced sales and supervisory systems and expanded broker and
supervisory training programs, Randal Mudge, Olde's managing
director, said in a news release. The company said it planned to
employ an independent consultant to review its policies and
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   According to the SEC complaint, brokers routinely used
high-pressure sales practices, and earned substantially higher
commissions for selling stocks in which Olde made a market. Many of
those stocks were speculative and unsuitable for elderly, retired
investors, Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   The firm advertised commission-free services to investors,
failing to tell them that the firm made money on many of the stocks
that brokers were pushing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The firm created a situation that channeled their brokers'
efforts to selling a narrow slice of the investment products'' that
Olde offered and ``resulted in the brokers' illegal conduct,''
Murphy said.

D'AMATO VOTES AGAINST FUND-RAISING CHANGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Brushing aside pressure from Democrats and
government watchdog groups, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, D-N.Y., voted
Thursday against legislation that would overhaul federal campaign
finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, a voracious fund-raiser who has consistently voted
against changing campaign finance rules, joined 47 other
Republicans in successfully blocking efforts to end debate on the
bill and force a final vote. Although more votes on the bill are
possible in the Senate this year, Thursday's vote was viewed by
some of the bill's supporters as its death knell.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, sponsored by Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Russell
Feingold, D-Wis., would ban unregulated contributions to parties,
known as soft money, and restrict issue advertisements by
independent groups during the campaign season.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to D'Amato, a Republican who is running for a fourth
term this year, said the senator voted against the bill because
changes he wanted _ including to allow soft money contributions,
with limits _ were not made.
</P>
<P>
   Groups supporting tougher campaign finance laws have been
running radio advertisements, distributing literature and operating
phone banks in an effort to pressure D'Amato to change his vote.
The groups said Thursday that their campaigns would continue.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also said they would make an issue of the senator's
position in the coming weeks. ``New York Republicans are the worst
abusers of campaign finance laws in the country,'' said Judith
Hope, the New York Democratic chairwoman, ``and Senator D'Amato is
determined to continue that sorry record.''
</P>
<P>
   But some of the bill's supporters said they didn't think voters
would punish people like D'Amato this November, largely because
President Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky had drowned
out all other issues.

MARV ALBERT RETURNS TO TV MONDAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Monday at 11 p.m. Marv Albert will return to work, as host of
the redesigned MSG SportsDesk, offering news, interviews and
highlights. It will be exactly a year since he last worked, when he
called a Giants-Ravens game for NBC.
</P>
<P>
   After that came a trial for sexual assault, a guilty plea to a
misdemeanor charge, psychotherapy and exile. The MSG Network
rehired him in July, though, and he has been planning and
rehearsing for his new job since early last month.
</P>
<P>
   And on Wednesday, he married Heather Faulkiner, his longtime
fiancee.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good time,'' he said Thursday by telephone, from his
honeymoon. He added: ``I've been going into the office for the last
three weeks, getting the feel of going into a studio again. The
toughest part is the mechanics. I had to learn to use a computer.
When I was doing the sports at Channel 4, I used an old Royal
typewriter.''
</P>
<P>
   The new ``SportsDesk'' can become a ``virtual'' studio, capable
of making it seem as if Albert is on-site, at arenas near and far.
``We won't be fooling anyone,'' he said. ``I'll be at the desk in
the studio.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy is revamping the show around Albert's ability to
interview players and announcers live from the games, and studio
guests when possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll be brief,'' Albert said. ``You've got to keep things
moving.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy said Albert's been ``very focused, very passionate,
even a pain in the neck,'' during rehearsals and planning.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, these are changed times. ``You can't say it's
like nothing has changed,'' he said. ``Marv's a different guy. The
last time he was here, he was a star, with the shades on, floating
in for a game at 6 o'clock.''
</P>
<P>
   Albert is a different commodity than he once was. His legal woes
turned him from famous to notorious. His renown was a factor in MSG
hiring him to anchor the revamped SportsDesk. He is expected to
draw a curious viewership early on.
</P>
<P>
   ``There'll be a certain audience for Monday night,'' McCarthy
said. ``It's the folks who continue on Tuesday night that I'm
interested in.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Albert: ``I hope people accept me, sure, but it's not in my
control. I certainly hope people judge what they see.'' &QL;

GOODYEAR TURNS IN 225.9-MPH PRACTICE LAP AT TEXAS MOTOR SPEEDWAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Taking advantage of relatively cool
conditions, Scott Goodyear posted a practice lap at 225.9 mph _ a
mile and a half faster than the official Pep Boys Indy Racing
League qualifying record _ at Texas Motor Speedway yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear and rookie teammate David Steele closed out two days of
preparations for the Lone Star 500K at the 1.5-mile trioval on
Sept. 20. Goodyear, driver of the No. 4 Pennzoil G Force/Olds
Aurora, ran a hot lap of 222 mph on Wednesday morning and easily
bested that effort yesterday when the temperature was reported at
89 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Because the lap was not recorded during qualifying or the race,
Goodyear's run at 225.9 remains an unofficial record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hoped we would see 224 or 225 before we leave here, even in
the heat,'' said Goodyear, lead driver for Panther Racing. ``I'm
not sure we'll see 226, 227 or 228 because it's a day race and
because of the heat. But we'll probably see 224 or 226, if we start
to get a tow (in the draft).''
</P>
<P>
   Reigning series champion Tony Stewart set the official IRL
record at TMS at 224.448 mph during qualifying for the True Value
500K night race in June. Stewart also posted the fastest lap in a
``new formula'' IRL car during the race at 228.012 mph.

MUSTANG GOES RETRO 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MICHELLE KREBS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For its 35th anniversary, the Ford Mustang has received a
makeover that includes hints of the original pony car.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 Mustang sports edgier lines in keeping with the
original 1964 Mustang and with Ford's New Edge design, which uses
sharp edges to create surface tension on the metal. Other classic
styling cues from the original include a long hood and short deck
lid, a prominent hood scoop, triangular side scoops and signature
three-element tail lamps. The Mustang emblem on the grille is also
reminiscent of the original: the galloping pony is circled by a
chrome corral.
</P>
<P>
   The new Mustang has more horsepower in both the V6 and V8
engines. The 3.8-liter V6 is rated at 190 horsepower, a
40-horsepower increase. The 4.6-liter V8 gets a 35-horsepower lift
to 260 horsepower. Torque for both also increases. An optional
all-speed traction control system will be offered to help the
rear-drive Mustang trot through the snow.
</P>
<P>
   The new Mustang goes on sale in December; a high-performance
Cobra version follows in February. No prices have been announced.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Volkswagen missed the mark on demand for yellow and silver
Beetles. So instead of ``Drivers wanted,'' it's ``Cars wanted,''
and some would-be Beetle buyers are seeing red.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Van Leeuwen went to three dealerships in New York and
Connecticut in search of a silver VW New Beetle. The first didn't
have any in stock, the second tried to charge him $500 more than
the sticker price, and the third took his $500 deposit and told him
to wait 10 weeks. When the car finally arrived in June, it was
white.
</P>
<P>
   Van Leeuwen, 55, who lives in Greenwich, Conn., said he tried to
get in touch with Larry Jimenez, the area executive for Volkswagen,
but his calls were not returned. Van Leeuwen sent the company two
e-mail messages via its Web page. No response. He faxed a letter to
Clive Warrilow, Volkswagen's United States president. No response.
Finally, he called Volkswagen's toll-free information number and
was told that silver was not a popular color and therefore was
restricted in production.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just so upset, we had been jerked around so badly,''
he said. ``Not one person from Volkswagen called us up to say,
`We're so sorry.'''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Fouladpour, a spokesman for Volkswagen, said that Jimenez
relied on the dealership's sales manager, and added, ``The
dealership assured us that the customer was offered this car.'' Van
Leeuwen, meanwhile, insists he was never contacted nor offered a
silver New Beetle.
</P>
<P>
   The confusion surrounding this case seems to be emblematic of
the difficulties that have plagued the New Beetle since it was
introduced to much fanfare in the United States in March. The
introduction offers lessons in the difficulty of predicting
consumer tastes and in the pitfalls of rolling out a wildly
successful product. The company not only underestimated the
popularity of yellow and silver 1998 models, but also could not
offer leather seats, as promised.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Volkswagen's communication with its dealers
and its response to numerous consumers' questions and complaints
seem uncoordinated at best. The company also appears to have little
influence over dealers who mark up the price.
</P>
<P>
   It's not surprising that Volkswagen low-balled demand for yellow
and silver cars. Last year, silver cars accounted for less than 8
percent of all subcompact cars in North America, according to a new
survey by PPG Industries. And yellow cars were so rare they weren't
even included in the study.
</P>
<P>
   But demand for yellow Beetles is running at about 16 percent,
while the factory in Puebla, Mexico, is only building 12.5 percent
in yellow. Demand for silver is a whopping 20 percent, while the
average weekly production is less than 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Why silver? ``The New Beetle is sort of Art Deco,'' explained
Elaine Brockman, a would-be New Beetle owner in Decatur, Ga. ``It's
a futuristic, Jetsons' car. Silver is complimentary toward that
image. Other colors tend to make it look more like a toy car.''
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen said its supply of silver and yellow cars should
improve in the next six to seven months, and the overall supply of
cars for the North American market is expected to rise after the
second year of production.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, customers in some areas must wait four months for a
silver or yellow car. In Alberta, Lesley Dahl put a deposit on a
silver New Beetle in July and was told not to expect delivery
before spring.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of coordination and communication among the company,
dealers and customers is turning the shortage into a public
relations mess.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brockman put down a $500 deposit on a silver Beetle at
Dwight Harrison Volkswagen at the end of May. She was No. 7 on a
waiting list. In July, she called VW's toll-free line and was told
production of silver cars had ceased in mid-May. She called back a
week later and was told the factory was building silver cars, but
silver was a time-consuming color to paint. The customer service
representative said the dealer should have more-up-to-date
information.
</P>
<P>
   That was hardly the case. Gene Paris, a sales manager at Dwight
Harrison Volkswagen, said in an interview that the cars were
allocated on a monthly basis, and he never knew what to expect.
</P>
<P>
   On May 19, dealers in the Northeast got a memo from Jimenez
saying, ``VW factories have unknowingly made many changes to
vehicle orders.'' Specifically, white Beetles were being delivered
instead of yellow and silver cars.
</P>
<P>
   Fouladpour of Volkswagen said, ``Since that time, the situation
has been mostly resolved,'' but he added, ``We are restricted and
continue to be restricted on those two colors.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there are many satisfied Beetle buyers, and the car
has developed a sort of cult following on the Internet. The dozens
of Web sites include New Beetle Club (www.aiwana.com/nbc.htm),
Alternative New Beetle (www.geocities.com/MotorCity/Garage/1977/)
and North Texas New Beetles (www.angelfire.com/tx/NTNB).
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty surrounding Beetle sales, however, has spurred
confusion among potential customers, many of whom have posted
questions on Beetle discussion boards and mailing lists on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, paint problems were not the only woes for VW in
the introduction of the New Beetle. A shortage of leather forced
dealers to pull brochures advertising leather seats and interiors
for the 1998 model. The company said leather options will be
available for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these troubles, New Beetles have been flying off
dealership lots ince their debut in March. Demand is so strong
that many dealers can charge more than the $15,200 starting price.
Fouladpour said VW discouraged such markups, but added: ``They are
independent businessmen and retailers, and from a legal standpoint
there is nothing we can do.''

YOUNG GOTTI AND CO-DEFENDANTS ARE SAID TO REJECT PLEA DEALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SELWYN RAAB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal prosecutors have offered plea-bargaining
deals to reputed Mafia leader John A. Gotti and his co-defendants
in a major racketeering case, but the proposal has been rejected by
Gotti, lawyers and investigators close to the case said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that
prosecutors made tentative offers last month to Gotti and 10 other
defendants for lighter sentences in exchange for guilty pleas to
reduced charges. So far, the lawyers said, none of the clients had
accepted the plea bargains. But they said several clients might do
so, if the prosecutors revised their offers.
</P>
<P>
   A defense lawyer emphasized that no plea was imminent for Gotti,
the son of the imprisoned John Gotti, who the authorities say is
the boss of the Gambino crime family.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no negotiations about John,'' said Bruce Cutler, the
lawyer for the younger Gotti. ``His instructions to me are clear:
`Get ready for trial; I want to clear my name.'''
</P>
<P>
   Other lawyers and U.S. Justice Department officials said that
Cutler's co-counsel, Gerald Shargel, and another lawyer, James
LaRossa, who were delegated as a defense team committee, had
discussed possible plea agreements with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers said that the negotiations had been initiated by
prosecutors, but government officials asserted that the defense
team had raised the possibility of potential pleas before the trial
begins in January in White Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officials say that under rules established by
the elder Gotti a decade ago, Gambino family members must obtain
his permission to plead guilty. And, in their plea agreements,
members cannot acknowledge that they are linked to the family, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers and federal investigators said the plea bargain that the
younger Gotti turned down would have included a prison sentence of
about 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Smilon, a spokesman for Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney
for the Southern District of New York, whose office is prosecuting
Gotti, declined to comment on the offers made to Gotti and the
other defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Gotti, 34, who is known as Junior, was indicted in January on
charges involving extortion of the former owners of Scores, the
Manhattan nightclub, and profiting from the Gambino family's
rackets in gambling and other interests. He is being held without
bail.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officials say that the younger Gotti had the
title of acting boss of the Gambino family bestowed on him in 1992
by the elder Gotti, 58, when the father began serving a life
sentence for racketeering and murder.
</P>
<P>
   The Gambino group, the authorities say, is the nation's
second-largest and most powerful Mafia family.
</P>
<P>
   Another reputed Gambino family leader, John D'Amico, 63,
rejected an offer of a sentence of 41 to 51 months, according to
his lawyer, James DiPietro.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm under the impression that discussions are going on,''
DiPietro said in an interview. ``But I'm not part of it, and we are
preparing for trial.''

TEACHERS IN A NEW JERSEY TOWNSHIP END A WEEKLONG STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDDLETOWN TOWNSHIP, N.J. _ A bitter weeklong teachers' strike
at the 17 schools in this sprawling central New Jersey suburb ended
Thursday morning about an hour before a court hearing in which a
judge was to consider dismissing 800 striking teachers.
</P>
<P>
   After a night of bargaining, negotiators for the school board
and the local teachers' union accepted a state labor conciliator's
proposal for a contract at about 7:50 a.m. By doing so, the union
spared its members possible job sanctions or jail sentences, and
the board freed itself from a union accusation that it had violated
a state labor law by imposing a contract on teachers last July.
</P>
<P>
   Both issues had deepened two and a half years of tension between
the union and the board and had the potential of spreading beyond
Middletown and jarring a decade of labor peace between school
boards and teachers' unions in New Jersey's 593 school districts.
</P>
<P>
   Although the teachers returned to work immediately, school
officials said the district's 10,200 students would continue on a
half-day class schedule until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The five-year settlement, drafted by James Mastriani of the
state's Public Employment Relations Commission, provides annual
wage increases of 3.2 percent, retroactive to the expiration of the
teachers' last contract in July 1996, when their average salary was
$51,379 a year, compared with the state average of $50,025 at that
time. The new contract also requires teachers earning more than
$30,000 to pay up to $250 a year for dental and health insurance.
Under the imposed contract, now voided, teachers received annual
increases of 2.8 percent and had to pay $600 to $1,900 of their
health benefit premium.
</P>
<P>
   On another major issue, the contract requires middle school
teachers to increase their daily teaching load to six periods from
five. They will receive extra pay of $1,650.
</P>
<P>
   With the settlement, the board set aside its motion before Judge
Clarkson Fisher of New Jersey Superior Court that he order the
resignation of the striking teachers for defying a back-to-work
order he issued a week ago. Arguments on the motion had been
scheduled for 9 a.m. Friday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the past, such orders have been issued in only four other
teachers' strikes. In each, the teachers immediately settled or
returned to work and were not forced to resign.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the New Jersey Department of Education, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the legality of such orders was
uncertain because the state's tenure law stipulated that teacher
resignations must be voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   Since the strike started, the union had vowed not to settle
unless the imposed contract was rescinded. If the contract had
stood, union leaders said, other school boards around the state
would have been emboldened to force contracts on teachers when
negotiations stalled. Before now, only nine such contracts had been
imposed in the 30-year history of the state labor law that provides
for them.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Public Employment Relations Commission granted
the Middletown union a hearing on its complaint that the school
board had illegally imposed the contract because state mediators
had not formally declared an impasse. On Thursday, Diane Swaim,
president of the union, said the complaint would be dropped.

CLINTON'S LEADERSHIP ABILITY MAY WELL BE UNDERCUT, SAYS N.J.
GOVERNOR 
(N.J. ATTN)
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ President Clinton should consider resigning if the
controversy engulfing him reaches a point that he is unable to
effectively perform his duties, New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd
Whitman said Thursday in Los Angeles during a tour to help fellow
Republicans' campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman, considered an up-and-coming figure in the GOP, said the
Clinton travails so dominate the thoughts of those who have
dealings with the United States that she worries about the impact
on foreign and domestic policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``A resignation is something he has to come to terms with on his
own; where he has to decide if his ability to lead the country has
been permanently damaged,'' Whitman said at a breakfast with Los
Angeles political reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of what we're seeing in the stock market is
reaction to a concern as to whether the president is able to
continue to lead. It would be foolish to say it hasn't impacted
him. If it has reached the point to where he should resign ... I'm
not there yet. That's up to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's national fund-raising tour includes several California
stops to help Republican Attorney General Dan Lungren's
gubernatorial campaign, and she is scheduled to return in October
for other events.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout her travels, as well as during a recent trip to
Israel, Jordan and Egypt, Whitman said, the investigation into
Clinton has had a major impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does matter,'' said Whitman. ``The president lied for seven
months and he hung people close to him out to dry. He's got real,
real problems here and he has to do a lot of soul-searching on how
he goes forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere I went, I was questioned by foreign leaders on his
ability to lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said she is uncertain about how Clinton's problems will
impact the November elections, but speculated that it might dampen
turnout, particularly among Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Whitman said she believes the Republican
message of reducing taxes and having a more efficient government is
beginning to get through to the American public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not done a good job in selling our accomplishments,''
she said. ``We tend to go in and fix things and then not take
credit for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman hopes to provide a major boost to Lungren, particularly
in keeping Republican women from voting for his Democratic
opponent, Lt. Gov. Gray Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman, who is strongly pro-abortion rights, said she has no
problem in campaigning for Lungren, a staunch opponent of abortion
who has said he would not attempt to make major changes in the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``This election is about more than abortion,'' said Whitman.
``People try to pit Republicans against each other on this issue,
when being a Republican is about so much more than that.''

DESIGNER LOOKS BACK WITH PAIN AND PRIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOYCE WADLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the 1960s, the clothing designer Stan Herman was
hot and then he was not, and now, sitting in his little studio
overlooking Bryant Park, his voice husky from walking pneumonia, he
is theorizing about it.
</P>
<P>
   Theorizing cheerfully, with amusement rather than bitterness,
for even when the germs are winning, Herman is an upbeat man.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the world went sportswear, I was sitting with Anne Klein
in Bill's _ that's a bar on 40th Street where all the designers
used to hang out,'' Herman says. ``We're drinking our Scotch, and
Annie says, `I'm going to do parts and pieces, and everything will
go with everything else, and people will save those parts and
pieces, and next year they'll buy more parts and pieces.' My mouth
is hanging open and I say, `That's a fabulous idea.' She says, `Why
don't you do the same thing?' I never did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why? I don't know,'' he said. ``Other things came into my
life. Annie had the alter ego of her husband. I never had the alter
ego she had, that Ralph perhaps had with his brother, that Calvin
had with Barry Schwartz. Somebody in the business with them who
says, `Let's do it this way.' I thought I could do it all. I still
do.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say Stan Herman's life in design has been a bust.
His chenille robes are one of the biggest sellers on the QVC
Network, and he is a leading designer of uniforms, doing clothes
for McDonald's, Fedex, Avis, hotels and casinos. (Socioeconomic
fashion note: Casino management does not care for pockets on the
uniforms, nor french cuffs _ dealers can tuck cash into them.)
</P>
<P>
   Herman has had his greatest success, however, as an organizer.
Since becoming the unpaid president of the Council of Fashion
Designers of America nearly eight years ago, Herman has made it a
force in New York. He oversaw the creation of Seventh on Sixth,
consolidating fashion shows that had been scattered throughout the
city and bringing them to one media-friendly spot in Bryant Park.
Under his leadership the council has raised $10 million for AIDS
research and $5 million for work on breast cancer. Next month, the
United Hospital Fund will give Stan Herman its Distinguished
Community Award.
</P>
<P>
   Herman is far too forthright to pretend it doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago, Rudi Gernreich said to me, `I'm gonna give you my
mantle _ you have the head for it,''' Herman says. ``It never quite
worked out that way. I found another way to do it. And I'll tell
you honestly, it filled a part of my ego that hadn't been filled
for a while. I was in the shadows a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Herman, who grew up in Passaic, N.J., always wanted to be a
designer. When it came time to go to college, however, he didn't go
to New York. He chose the University of Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was somewhat concerned about my sexuality,'' Herman says.
``New York frightened me.''
</P>
<P>
   He was concerned about being a gay man?
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know I was gay,'' Herman says. ``I thought this
adoration of a friend I had was a phase. I did a great deal of
reading about it, and they all described it as a phase. When I was
in college, I made sure no homosexual would be in my fraternity.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadness comes over him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't that awful?'' he says. ``I could cry, I could cry. But I
was living a heterosexual life then. I realized what I was later,
in the Army. There was a subterranean gay culture. When I left the
Army, I found it much easier to come back to New York. I had
arranged my head.''
</P>
<P>
   At 24, Herman met Gene Horowitz, a teacher and writer, with whom
he would live for 39 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love at first sight,'' Herman says, recalling the meeting.
``The second I met him I knew it, knew it, knew it! I looked at him
and thought, `What is that?''
</P>
<P>
   Herman became successful. He won three Coty fashion awards. The
New York Times called Herman the people's designer, and he was
proud of that. He created a line of stylish and affordable women's
clothing, Mort. He designed a hospital gown that did not reveal the
patient's behind.
</P>
<P>
   And yet he never made it into the world of name designers.
Herman believes it had to do with his inability to put together the
right business team, and with his move into uniforms. There were
also personal reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard for me to bring Seventh Avenue home into my life
with Gene,'' Herman says. ``There was so much that was phony, so
much artifice and small talk, and he just was not good at it. I
never lost my business, but I stepped aside from the hot center of
it. I felt it was taking the root of me. There was so little of me
left when I came home.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene Horowitz died of a heart attack in January 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Four months later, Herman became president of the Council of
Fashion Designers. He is out so often, these days, that he owns
five dinner suits. He is also a wealthy man, with a duplex in
Manhattan and three little houses in Southampton.
</P>
<P>
   Ask him what he's proudest of, however, and he doesn't talk
about his career or the money he has raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``My relationship,'' Herman says. ``That I had 39 phenomenal
years with someone. That I could pick up the pieces when Gene died
and take it to another level. I could have dissolved, I could have
afforded to fade away and do nothing, and I didn't want to.''

THE `NEW JANA' IS ENJOYING THE RIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also TEN-USOPEN) 
(mk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jana Novotna, a Grand Slam singles champion, had just
reached the semifinals of the U.S. Open without dropping a set, and
now someone wanted to ask a question.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, you were tagged as a choker,'' her inquisitor
began.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the first time I hear that in six weeks,'' Novotna
interjected. ``It feels good.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been a feel-good period for the long-frustrated Czech
with the graceful attacking game. Winning Wimbledon in July not
only allowed her to achieve her midsummer fortnight's dream, but it
also allowed her to begin living in the moment instead of re-living
the past.
</P>
<P>
   As Novotna prepares for her semifinal Friday against her doubles
partner, Martina Hingis, she finds herself within striking distance
of more ground-breaking developments: her second consecutive Grand
Slam title and her first run as the No. 1 player in the world.
</P>
<P>
   If Novotna wins this tournament, she will displace Hingis atop
the rankings. She will also displace Hingis if she reaches the
final and Venus Williams defeats Lindsay Davenport Friday in the
other second semifinal, an all-American encounter that will not be
lacking in velocity or audacity from the baseline.
</P>
<P>
   If Novotna were to face Davenport in the final, Davenport could
become No. 1 with a victory, although her right elbow is sore
enough to make that a less likely prospect. In short, there is much
to be resolved over the next three days, but the difference in
Flushing Meadows this year is that Novotna is no longer seeking
resolution. She no longer needs to explain why she ended up leaning
and sobbing on the Duchess of Kent's shoulder in 1993 after blowing
the third set of the final against Steffi Graf. She no longer needs
to explain why she blew a 5-0, 40-0 lead and nine match points in
the third set against Chanda Rubin at the 1995 French Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right after Wimbledon, I said, `This is going to be the
beginning of new Jana,' and so far it really feels that way,''
Novotna said after defeating Patty Schnyder in the quarterfinals in
two lopsided sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I do a press conference or I'm recognized by
somebody or talking to somebody, there is not a word about anything
in the past. Only the present time, which is great. I have been
waiting a long time to change that, and I knew that the only way to
change this would be to win a Grand Slam title.''
</P>
<P>
   Since losing in the quarterfinals of the French Open to Monica
Seles in three sets, Novotna has won 27 of 29 singles matches. At
the Open, she has negotiated a potentially tricky draw with telling
ease, defeating Sandrine Testud of France, ninth-seeded Irina
Spirlea and the 11th-seeded Schnyder without surrendering more than
three games in any set. Novotna is moving well, serving well enough
and striking the ball with the sort of confident precision that has
often been missing from her game in big events.
</P>
<P>
   What is intriguing about Novotna is that, with her 30th birthday
looming next month, her game appears to be heading for the uplands
rather than clinging to a plateau. Novotna attributes this to not
taking tennis seriously until she was 21 and asked Hana Mandlikova,
the former Czech star, to become her coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike the other coaches, Hana doesn't need this job,''
Novotna said recently. ``She does it because she likes hard work
and admires hard work, and she is one of the hardest-working people
I know.''
</P>
<P>
   Novotna will certainly have to work to beat Hingis for the
second consecutive time. The Swiss holds a 6-3 edge over Novotna
and played one of her best recent matches in the quarterfinals
against Seles.
</P>
<P>
   If Novotna is to win, she must attack the net selectively, just
as she did in the Wimbledon semifinals, and force Hingis to hit
more forehands than backhands. But even though Hingis is the
defending champion here, Novotna has been playing like the
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Novotna said she has yet to feel too much pressure on her
privacy off the court. ``I love to be recognized,'' she said.
``It's a very nice feeling you have that you have achieved
something and you travel from one country to another and people
know you and appreciate what you did. But I don't want this to go
any further.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, one of her listeners said, `You realize if you win
the U.S. Open, it will go further.''
</P>
<P>
   Novotna thought about that for a moment and then said, ``Let's
take it a little further then.''

CLINTON CRISIS HURTS MARKET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Bears are running rampant through Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   With the possible resignation or impeachment of President
Clinton in the wings, the stock market has spent the past two
sessions giving up Tuesday's gains, when issues surged on Federal
Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan's hints of an interest-rate
cut.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average plunged 249.48 points Thursday
to close at 7,615.54, only recovering somewhat in the last hour of
trading after falling as much as 345 points. The index of 30
blue-chip stocks went back into negative territory for 1998, down
4.39 percent for the year, after flirting with an overall gain as a
result of Tuesday's historic 380-point rally.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon was the only Dow component to rise. The biggest losers
were American Express, 3M, Hewlett-Packard and General Electric.
</P>
<P>
   The broader indexes followed suit. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
Index fell 26.02 points to 980.18, with 406 companies losing
ground, and is now up a mere 0.53 percent for the year. The Nasdaq
Composite Index dropped 38.97 points to 1,585.58 and is up only
0.25 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market, already reeling from the threat of a global
recession and weaker corporate earnings, took a further tumble with
the uncertainty over America's leadership caused by Clinton's
deepening political problems.
</P>
<P>
   Leaks about Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's report to
Congress and sliding approval ratings underscore the seriousness of
his dilemma. A CBS News poll reported 59 percent of Americans
approved of the president's overall job performance, down from 65
percent last month and the first time since January that the figure
has dropped below 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But while Clinton's problems dampened the market, the impact
won't be long-lived, said Charles Carlson, contributing editor of
the Dow Theory Forecasts newsletter in Hammond, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too much power is attributed to political events,'' he said.
``Ultimately, stock prices follow earnings, interest rates and
inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlson believes corporate earnings signify trouble despite low
interest rates and inflation. His concern was echoed by Charles
Hill, director of research at First Call, a research firm that
tracks analysts' earnings estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said Asia, and especially Japan, are having a more serious
impact on earnings than previously believed, with currency
devaluation and the region's economic crisis making Asians less
able to afford U.S. goods and services. Japan's recession makes
matters worse because it is an important trading partner of -- and
investor in -- many Asian nations, he said, adding, ``Until Japan
gets its house in order, this is going to spiral down.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall third-quarter earnings estimates have been cut from a
15.1 percent year-to-year gain at the start of the year to 0.8
percent currently, while fourth-quarter estimates have fallen from
19.1 percent to 11.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Carlson said that while Asia does not take up a major portion of
sales at most American businesses, even a small decline hurts.
Since corporate earnings have been strong in recent years, and Wall
Street builds on a continuing expectation of that strength as
businesses have to beat estimates every quarter, even a small hit
will make them miss earnings expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Computer-chip giant Intel was a bright spot Thursday. After the
market closed, it announced third-quarter sales will rise 10
percent from the second quarter due to unexpectedly strong demand
in North America and Europe. Analysts expect Intel shares to rise
today along with other tech stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But the overall market will go lower, said Richard McCabe, chief
market analyst at Merrill Lynch. Low inflation, the possibility of
an interest-rate cut and a strong bond market are outweighed by
global economic woes, deflation worries, weaker corporate earnings
and a slowdown in the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the bad side is overwhelming the good side,''
McCabe said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the doom and gloom, mutual fund redemptions have been
relatively small, according to AMG Data Services, an Arcata firm
that tracks money flows of 12,300 funds with a total value of $4
trillion.
</P>
<P>
   For the week ended Wednesday, stock mutual funds saw an increase
of $1.4 billion with large-cap funds receiving the bulk of the
money, while money market funds swelled by $6.25 billion. Taxable
bond funds rose by $252 million, and municipal bond funds slipped
by $8 million. The four-week moving average for stock funds, which
smooths out the weekly volatility, fell $1.4 billion.

EDITORIAL: NOT GIVING UP ON CAMPAIGN REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Wis.)  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Sept. 11:
</P>
<P>
   After two days of debate, a clear majority of 52 senators again
demonstrated Thursday that they favor legislation to ban ``soft
money'' and clean up the nation's corrupt election fund-raising
system. Unfortunately, those 52 votes were not enough to shut down
a filibuster engineered by Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader.
As a result, John McCain of Arizona, the leading Republican sponsor
of campaign reform, withdrew his bill and seems ready to give up
this year. Abandoning the cause now would be a mistake. Campaign
reform should be re-introduced again and again to dramatize its
urgency and raise pressure on holdout senators.
</P>
<P>
   Acting like the soul of magnanimity, Lott declared that he had
done his best to give the legislation a full airing, and now it was
time to get on to other business free of disruption by the
reformers. But it is the opponents of campaign finance reform who
are disrupting the Senate with their filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has had a distinguished career as an independent-minded
senator on campaign finance reform, tobacco legislation and other
issues. To cave in to Lott's pressure is not worthy of him. He
should make it clear that he will support, and even introduce, a
series of attempts this month to keep campaign finance reform
alive. Enough votes to break a filibuster can be assembled if
pressure is maintained by McCain and by Sen. Russell Feingold of
Wisconsin and other Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain-Feingold legislation would end the practice of
harvesting huge sums in so-called ``soft money'' from corporations,
unions and rich individuals, and then using the money to pay for
campaign ads in circumvention of longstanding curbs on fund raising
by candidates. Already Senate and House Republican and Democratic
committees are using tens of millions of dollars in soft money for
campaign ads this fall. Distracted as they are in this season of
scandal, lawmakers must surely be able to see the sorry spectacle
of special-interest money tainting the political process, and the
public's growing revulsion. If they cannot see it, they should at
least be required to face the issue again, this fall, in more
votes.

RAMBIS TO STAY WITH LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ First Jerry West, now Kurt Rambis. Slowly
but surely, the Lakers are bringing their key leaders back into the
fold after a summer of uncertainty and outside temptations.
</P>
<P>
   West, the team's executive vice president, signed a contract
extension last week rather than pursue other opportunities. Rambis
followed suit Thursday, saying he would continue as an assistant
coach with the Lakers rather than pursue the head coaching
vacancies of the Clippers and Sacramento Kings.
</P>
<P>
   The 40-year-old Rambis interviewed with both teams, but in an
echo of West's recent sentiments, said: ``My gut feeling told me
that this is where I belong.''
</P>
<P>
   Rambis' ties with the Lakers run deep, from his playing days in
the 1980s to his second career as an assistant to coach Del Harris
the last four seasons. Highly regarded around the NBA, Rambis is
likely to become a head coach in the near future, but for now
figures his current post is the most beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers and Kings are both perennial lottery teams with
lousy job security. And the situation is even more tenuous in
Sacramento, where owner Jim Thomas might sell the team next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, your first (head) coaching opportunity has to be a
real good one,'' Rambis said. ``I have a very good job, working for
a very good organization, so at this point in time I can afford to
be choosy.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking over a losing team, then taking the fall, can have a
lasting effect on a coach's career, a fact Rambis is mindful of.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes that label can follow you around for a long time,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Clippers say they only interviewed him, Rambis said
the franchise made him ``a nice offer'' but ``it just never got to
the point where it was going to take me away from here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers have no timetable for naming a replacement for the
dismissed Bill Fitch, other than to say they want someone in place
prior to training camp. Camps are due to open in early October,
pending resolution of the NBA's labor conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Kings vice president Geoff Petrie praised Rambis as ``a
promising head coaching prospect.'' Sacramento's remaining
candidates are Rick Adelman, Paul Silas and Scott Skiles.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers execs West and Mitch Kupchak were not available for
comment Thursday.

 OUT OF THE CLOSET AND INTO PRINT

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Andrew Tobias, the witty financial writer (this is
not an oxymoron) whose life as a gay man has quite literally become
an open book, faced the public this week in a way he could not have
dreamed about 25 years ago, when his first memoir ``The Best Little
Boy in the World'' (Putnam) was published.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Tobias was terrified of his homosexuality: he
couldn't tell his friends, his family, his co-workers. But he did
write a book about it, signing it with a pen name, John Reid.
</P>
<P>
   Now 51, he has written a sequel _ ``The Best Little Boy in the
World Grows Up,'' (Random House) _ and on Tuesday night he gave his
first reading as an author. An author called Andrew Tobias.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several people brought copies of the very first printing of
the first one,'' Tobias said of his audience at a Different Light,
which specializes in gay and lesbian publications. ``It quickly
became evident that the feeling in the room was a good feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   He began with an excerpt from the first book:
</P>
<P>
   ``In New York I was, as ever, thinking cosmic thoughts. One of
the best times to do this was as I walked back home from work in
the late evenings. I was certainly aware that there were hundreds
of thousands of gay men in the city. Anyone knows that. But I
wanted no part of them. I stared icily ahead and ignored every one
of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, from the sequel (on his hopes for the earlier book): ``In
my mind's eye, it was always straight people I was writing the book
for _ all the good people who, I was sure, if they just knew the
truth, would (a) be astounded and (b) rally round to right the
wrongs and change the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobias, whose humor often crackles with the absurd side of life,
acknowledged that perhaps the new book has a quieter tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through a lot, and maybe I'm a bit more
contemplative,'' he said. ``This is celebrating progress. It's
quite a different feeling from the feeling of enormous
indignation.''

   A Hotel Suite With a History
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On Sept. 12, 1953, Sen. John F. Kennedy, D-Mass., and
Jacqueline Bouvier were married in Newport, R.I. The reception for
1,200 was held at Hammersmith Farm, the estate of the bride's
family.
</P>
<P>
   The couple spent their honeymoon in Acapulco, Mexico. But not
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Less well known is that they spent their wedding night at the
Waldorf Towers. And Saturday, precisely 45 years later, a young New
York couple will be married at the hotel and spend the night in the
same suite.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, in their 20s, requested anonymity (for at least one
more day). They picked the date and the place without knowing the
Kennedy history, but learned about it from a book called ``Wedding
Days'' (Morrow, 1997), by Susan Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about couples who did extraordinary things with their
lives,'' Ms. Gordon said Thursday. The first wedding chronicled in
the book, she said, is that of Justinian and Theodora, in 524 A.D.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the emperor of Byzantium; she was an exotic dancer,''
Ms. Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   Although some redecorating has been done on the Waldorf since
the 1950s, the suite is said to be in the same configuration: a
large one-bedroom apartment with a sitting room and commanding
views of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Sharing the Wealth
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Manhattan judge charged Alec Wildenstein, the art
dealer whose family trades in Old Masters, with contempt of court
Thursday and ordered him arrested for failing to pay his estranged
wife, Jocelyne Wildenstein, $452,000 in court-ordered alimony.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Marylin Diamond of state Supreme Court delayed
imposing the order until Wednesday because Wildenstein was believed
to be out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildensteins, whose marital problems have generated almost
as much interest as the considerable cosmetic surgery Mrs.
Wildenstein has undergone on her face, are divorcing after nearly
20 years of marriage, luxury and travel between their East Side
town house, ranch in Kenya and chateau in France.

   NEW YORK _ One day after filing a federal lawsuit alleging that
Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, N.Y., is too unsafe to play hockey
in, the New York Islanders packed their office files, furniture and
some memorabilia into a convoy of vans. About 60 administrative
workers left and will relocate to office space in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   With the first regular-season game scheduled for Oct. 10, the
team is officially a hockey nomad, with no home arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are aggressively looking at our options to find a safe,
convenient and accessible environment for our fans,'' said Gary
Lewi, a spokesman for New York Sports Ventures, the partnership
that bought the team earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   After alleging a pattern of maintenance failures and refusal to
respond to safety issues by Spectacor Management Group, the arena
operator, the team felt its only logical action was to leave the
Uniondale facility. In the lawsuit, it seeks $10 million in damages
and to be released from its lease with Spectacor.

VIDEOS PROPEL `TITANIC' TO $2 BILLION IN REVENUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The ``Titanic'' money machine has now generated
more than $2 billion as it moves into a second life in the home
video market.
</P>
<P>
   The much-hyped video pulled in over $200 million in sales and
$8.5 million in rental revenue in its first week on store shelves
to go along with a domestic box office gross of $600.7 million,
foreign box office of $1.2 billion and $30 million for TV network
rights. Despite its unprecedented $200 million cost, the epic has
made about $1 billion in profits for Paramount and 20th Century
Fox.
</P>
<P>
   The Hollywood Reporter, citing unnamed sources, said Thursday
that the video sold between 12 million and 15 million copies in the
first six days following its Sept. 1 debut at prices ranging from
$9.95 to $29.95, equating to at least $210 million in revenue.
That's still short of the 20 million copies sold by ``The Lion
King'' in its first six days on its way to a record of 30 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The `Titanic' video is off to a great start,'' said Barbara
McNamara of video tracker Alexander and Associates. ``It should get
a second wave when the holiday shopping season starts, so final
sales of 20 million are achievable.''
</P>
<P>
   That would make ``Titanic'' the top seller domestically among
live-action videos, beating ``Independence Day'' and ``Jurassic
Park'' at 17 million. Half a dozen Disney animated titles have
topped the 20 million mark.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount, which is handling the domestic release, did not
disclose sales figures but a spokesman said the video was meeting
expectations and Blockbuster has reported pre-sales of more than 1
million copies. The studio and the chain are both owned by Viacom
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate development, ``Titanic'' writer-producer-director
James Cameron has teamed with veteran TV producer Charles Eglee to
produce TV series. The pact marks Cameron's first move into TV.

BAR OFF-DUTY OFFICERS FROM CARRYING GUNS WHEN DRINKING, PANEL
SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shedding a spotlight on the abuse of alcohol by
off-duty police officers, a mayoral commission urged the Police
Department Thursday to prohibit officers from carrying their guns
when they drink when not on the job.
 &UR;  &LR;  The panel, the Commission to Combat Police Corruption, noted that
a significant part of off-duty police misconduct occurred while
officers were under the influence of alcohol. In making the
recommendation, the panel is urging the department to tackle
something considered an ingrained part of Police Department
culture, a problem that has long been recognized at the highest
levels of the force.
</P>
<P>
   Without including the names of the officers and dates of the
incidents involved, the panel cited several examples of the
problem. An off-duty New York City police officer fired his gun
twice at an off-duty suburban police officer who was trying to pull
him over for drunken driving. The officer was convicted of driving
while intoxicated, but when the Police Department charged him
administratively, he refused to answer their questions. His
punishment was a 120-day suspension and a year's probation.
</P>
<P>
   And a drunken off-duty police officer took out his loaded 9-mm
service pistol on a subway platform, pointed it at a man's chest,
said, ``I can either push you or shoot you'' and then ordered
another man to his knees and said, ``I think I'm going to kill
you.'' The officer then banged his gun on the token booth window
and escaped on a train. Under a plea agreement, he was allowed to
retire with full pension benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Under current Police Department guidelines, off-duty police
officers are generally required to carry their service weapons with
them at all times as a way to help prevent crimes. But while
officers are given the leeway to leave their guns home when they go
to beaches, pools and places where alcohol is consumed, they are
not ordered or even advised to do so. In its report, the panel
recommended that the Police Department consider prohibiting
intoxicated off-duty officers from carrying guns altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recommend that the department look at the feasibility of an
actual ban on carrying your weapon if you are drinking,'' Richard
Davis, chairman of the commission, said at a news conference
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said that the commission came to its conclusion after
studying the 163 cases in 1996 in which police officers were
arrested and discovering that 80 percent of those cases involved
off-duty incidents and the majority of them drinking. It was
unclear Thursday whether the department would consider imposing
such a ban. Marilyn Mode, the department's deputy commissioner for
public information, did not return two calls to her office Thursday
seeking comment on the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir released a statement Thursday
night saying, ``The New York City Police Department works closely
with the Commission to Combat Police Corruption and will certainly
take all their comments and recommendations under advisement.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis acknowledged that the logistics of such a ban would be
difficult to work out because police officers were prohibited from
leaving their guns in their cars or bags and would therefore have
to take steps to leave them in their station houses or secured at
home.
</P>
<P>
   Current police guidelines make few provisions for officers who
drink to excess while off duty. In the patrol guide, for instance,
drinking to excess is simply prohibited. Police officers are
ordered to ``be fit for duty at all times, except when on sick
report'' and plainly told ``do not consume intoxicants to the
extent that member becomes unfit for duty.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, alcohol remains an ingrained part of the police
culture, from the tavern by the back door of police headquarters,
to the numerous retirement parties and testimonial dinners where
officers have been known to imbibe on occasion.

COMMENTARY: WHO'S WHO ON THE N.Y. BALLOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The mail included a handy guide to Tuesday's
Democratic primary that was prepared by the Citizens Union, an
organization usually described as a good-government group. (How
come you never hear about bad-government groups?) The booklet was
indeed informative, especially about the sad state of voter
interest in New York politics.
</P>
<P>
   According to Conn Nugent, the union's executive director,
something like 10,000 copies of the booklet have been sent out, a
far cry from the 25,000 that was typical for primaries in the early
1950s. ``Information is not nearly as much in demand as it once
was,'' Nugent lamented. ``What there is, in mountains, is apathy.''
</P>
<P>
   You probably know all about voter apathy by now _ and perhaps
don't care. Nonetheless, inspired by well-intentioned groups like
the Citizens Union, this column is offering its own guide to the
major races Tuesday, for governor and for U.S. senator.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most political columns, this one is unencumbered by
detailed knowledge of the candidates' stands on important issues
like health insurance and campaign finance reform. The suspicion
here is that most of you do not have any idea, either.
</P>
<P>
   This is Politics for Dummies, prepared by a dummy who bets that
many people, like him, enter the voting booth with only the vaguest
sense of the candidates. Who knows? Their impressions may very well
resemble these, starting with the three candidates for senator and
then the four for governor:
</P>
<P>
   GERALDINE FERRARO: Forgive the ignorance, but isn't the most
important thing about her, still, that she once ran for one of the
least important jobs in the country, vice president? Not only that,
but the ticket she was on lost by more votes than just about any
other in this century. Ah, but she was the first woman, you say.
True. But there are those who wonder if the big applause should be
reserved for the first female national candidate with a real chance
of winning, not a trophy sacrificial lamb.
</P>
<P>
   CHARLES SCHUMER: It is hard to shake the memory of a Schumer
campaign commercial last winter showing the candidate beside
President Clinton. This went on the air just as the Monica Lewinsky
scandal was breaking and many Democrats were starting to treat the
president as though he had a communicable disease. How did
apparatchiks in the White House thank Schumer for this display of
loyalty? They insisted that he kill his commercial. Some friends.
In retrospect, though, they may have done him a huge favor.
</P>
<P>
   MARK GREEN: Is that him running again? Polls do not show him
doing all that well. But the redoubtable Green usually manages to
land on his feet. Even if he loses, he could catch a break. Rudolph
Giuliani just might decide that no one would make a better
president than himself. Guess who becomes mayor if he steps aside
in 2000 to zip around the country? That's right. Public Advocate
Green.
</P>
<P>
   PETER VALLONE: You hear many questions about the City Council
speaker's vision of governance, including whether he even has one.
But if it is fair to judge a person by his enemies, consider this.
One of Vallone's strongest antagonists is George Steinbrenner.
Enough said.
</P>
<P>
   BETSY McCAUGHEY ROSS: This is going to sound terrible, but what
do you really know about her except that she has a mile-wide smile
and that, as lieutenant governor, she stood in an electric-blue
suit behind her boss, the governor, while he delivered a speech?
She was taken seriously as a gubernatorial candidate because her
rich husband said he would bankroll her. When he then decided that
his money clip looked better fastened, she suddenly looked a lot
less formidable. One question: Is this dependency on the kindness
of husbands really a boon for feminists?
</P>
<P>
   CHARLES HYNES: Although an ardent opponent of the death penalty,
he has, as Brooklyn's district attorney, pursued more capital cases
than any prosecutor in the state. Hynes explains the apparent
contradiction by saying that he is sworn to uphold the law, even
when he abhors it. Still, the reaction of some voters to all his
death-penalty cases has been: Huh?
</P>
<P>
   JAMES LAROCCA: If you believe that money corrupts, this former
state commissioner may be your Mr. Integrity. His campaign is
practically broke. Of course, the fact that he has raised little
money could mean he has little support. You decide.
</P>
<P>
   All we know is that up in Vermont this week, a man won the
Republican nomination for U.S. Senate on a campaign budget of $16
or so. It's enough to make any New York voter weep.

OFFICERS AND FIREMEN WORE BLACKFACE ON FLOAT, OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two New York City police officers and two city
firefighters were apparently part of a group of men wearing
blackface on a float in a Labor Day parade in Queens on Monday,
city officials said Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   An official in the Giuliani administration, speaking on the
condition of anonymity, said, ``We have information that two
firefighters and two police officers were on the float.''
</P>
<P>
   The riders on the float, part of an annual parade sponsored by
the Broad Channel Volunteer Fire Department and Ambulance Corps,
cavorted in blackface, at one point satirizing the killing of a
black man in Texas who was dragged to his death behind a pickup
truck this summer. An amateur videotape of the Queens parade was
first broadcast on Tuesday on WCBS-TV.
</P>
<P>
   The incident comes at a time of increasing tension between the
Police Department and minority groups, particularly blacks, who
have said it has not done enough to counter racism in its ranks.
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir have
come under harsh criticism this week from black leaders because of
the actions of the Police Department in ending a youth rally in
Harlem on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement about the parade float, Giuliani promised swift,
and stiff, punishment. ``I've spoken to commissioners Safir and Von
Essen,'' he said, referring to the police commissioner and Fire
Commissioner Thomas Von Essen, ``and we all agree that any police
officer, firefighter or other city employee involved in this
disgusting display of racism should be removed from positions of
responsibility immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``They will be fired.''
</P>
<P>
   The Queens district attorney's office has opened an
investigation into whether any state or civil rights laws were
violated during the parade. Richard Brown, the Queens district
attorney, stressed on Thursday night that while prosecutors had
studied a tape of the parade, no one had been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred in a quiet island community south of
Kennedy International Airport. According to the 1990 census, all
but about 1 percent of Broad Channel's 1,620 residents are white.
The census lists 23 Hispanic residents and no blacks or
Asian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Broad Channel is just three miles from Howard Beach, where a
group of whites attacked a black man in 1986, chasing him onto a
highway, where he was killed by a car. And it took place,
ironically enough, on Cross Bay Boulevard _ the same street where
the Howard Beach incident occurred.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``It's deja vu for me,'' said the Rev. Al Sharpton, referring to
Howard Beach. ``It brings back bad memories, but it also tells me
we still have a lot of work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a group of about a dozen men were riding on the
float, which was called ``Black to the Future: 2098.'' The homemade
float came at the tail of a mile-and-a-half parade on the boulevard
in Broad Channel. There were an estimated 3,000 spectators.
</P>
<P>
   As of Thursday night, city officials and investigators had not
identified any city employees involved in the incident. But at a
news conference Thursday night, four people from the neighborhood _
who were not employees of the Police or Fire departments _
announced that they had been on the float and apologized for their
actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were guilty of acting in bad taste, but what they did was
really no different from what `Saturday Night Live' or Howard Stern
does,'' said Robert DiDio, who, with Marvyn Kornberg, represents
the four men. ``They're sorry if anyone took offense.''
</P>
<P>
   The four men identified themselves as Timothy O'Connell, 28;
Kenneth Miller, 28; Teddy Rauert, 28; and Kevin Gill, 29, all of
Broad Channel. While they declined to say what they did for a
living, they said they were not city employees and were not
affiliated with the Broad Channel Volunteer Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, they tried to distance themselves from what
city officials considered was the most egregious act in the parade:
satirizing the murder of the black man dragged to his death in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   DiDio said there was only one man who pretended to be dragged
behind the truck during Monday's parade, and he had done so without
anyone else's prior knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   DiDio noted that the Broad Channel parade has had a long
tradition as a freewheeling, anything-goes kind of open-air party,
in which Jews, Asians and gay people, among other groups, have been
satirized.
</P>
<P>
   But the possibility that law enforcement personnel may have been
involved makes the parade a far more serious matter.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the Police Department has been hurt by what
many perceive as racially motivated misconduct, including the
attack on Abner Louima in August 1997. In that incident, according
to prosecutors, four officers beat Louima, a Haitian immigrant, in
a police car on the way to the 70th Precinct station house, and two
of the four tortured him after arriving there.
</P>
<P>
   One officer, Justin Volpe, has been accused of ramming a toilet
plunger handle into Louima's rectum and then into his mouth,
inflicting major internal injuries. A second officer, Charles
Schwarz, has been accused of holding Louima down during the attack.
</P>
<P>
   And on Saturday, officers in riot gear clashed with participants
in a youth rally in Harlem. The rally, called the Million Youth
March, had, even before it occurred, been the subject of bitter
words between the mayor and Khallid Abdul Muhammad, the organizer
of the march.
</P>
<P>
   As for Broad Channel, Monday's parade may well be the beginning
of a series of rallies and counterrallies. On Saturday, several
black leaders, led by Sharpton, plan to arrange a prayer vigil at
Macedonia Baptist Church in Rockaway Beach, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a quiet march,'' Sharpton said. ``Hopefully, the
response will be supportive.''

 McCAUGHEY ROSS ASSAILS VALLONE'S ABORTION STANCE  
 (bl)  
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross made her harshest
attack to date Thursday on her chief rival in the Democratic
gubernatorial primary, Peter Vallone, calling his position on
abortion rights ``a farce'' and questioning why he had not
pressured New York City to enforce its law protecting women from
harassment outside abortion clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCaughey Ross made her remarks as she visited a clinic in
Brooklyn that is the site of frequent anti-abortion protests. The
purpose of the visit, she said, was to draw attention to the fact
that city officials are not enforcing the law. But Ms. McCaughey
Ross and her aides spent much of the visit denouncing Vallone, who
is widely seen as the front-runner in Tuesday's primary.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion has not been a central issue in the race, since all
four Democratic gubernatorial candidates support a woman's right to
have the procedure. But in the final weeks of the campaign, Ms.
McCaughey Ross has worked hard to emphasize that she is the only
woman in the race. Her attack on Vallone on Thursday seemed to be
part of a broader strategy to prove that among the four candidates,
she was the strongest champion of women's rights.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone, the speaker of the New York City Council, helped push
through the law in 1993 and has held up his vote as proof that he
strongly supports abortion rights. But the lieutenant governor, who
has made a point of criticizing Vallone every day this week, said
he should have taken the extra step of making sure that it was
enforced.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is lacking here is not the protection of the law, but the
political will to enforce the law,'' she told a throng of reporters
as Patricia Ireland, president of the National Organization for
Women, nodded at her side. ``He has been part of creating an
atmosphere in this city, through his lack of leadership on this
issue, that has enabled our clinics to continue to be under
siege.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the race, Vallone has been careful not to attack his
opponents. But Thursday, his aides began a vigorous counterattack
against Ms. McCaughey Ross, circulating statements from other
politicians that praised his support of abortion rights. Vallone's
press secretary, Kim Rubey, even showed up at Ms. McCaughey Ross'
news conference outside the clinic, the Ambulatory Surgery Center,
in Sunset Park, exchanging sharp words with the lieutenant
governor's aides.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not up to Peter to enforce the city laws,'' Ms. Rubey
said. ``If she was truly concerned about this issue, why didn't she
work to enact a state clinic access bill so that women in Rochester
and Buffalo and Albany would have these same protections?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rubey pointed out that Ms. McCaughey Ross wrote an article
in 1992 praising a Supreme Court decision that allowed states to
restrict access to abortions, a ruling that Ms. Ireland and other
abortion rights advocates vehemently protested.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Supreme Court has provided the nation with common sense
and common ground,'' Ms. McCaughey Ross wrote in the article, which
was published in USA Today. ``Most Americans support a woman's
right to an abortion but also believe that, except in unusual
circumstances, a young girl's mother or father should be
consulted.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCaughey Ross said Thursday that her article had only
analyzed the court's decision, not sided with it. She said that she
has always supported abortion rights, and that she never favored
provisions that require parental consent for girls under 18 who
seek abortions. ``I have always opposed those restrictions on a
woman's right to choose,'' she said. ``I am unequivocally
pro-choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ireland said she was not bothered by the article Ms.
McCaughey Ross wrote because she, too, saw it as an analysis
instead of an opinion. She pointed out that Vallone introduced a
resolution in 1975 calling for parental consent. She also joined
Ms. McCaughey Ross in saying that his clinic access law was too
weak.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't enough that you can just pass a law and say, `Now
it's somebody else's job,''' Ms. Ireland said. ``I don't even see
him showing up to debate the issue, much less speaking out in a
forceful way.''
</P>
<P>
   Vallone still favors notification, Ms. Rubey said Thursday,
although the adult could be a counselor, clergy member or family
friend instead of a parent.
</P>
<P>
   The lieutenant governor's attack on Vallone's abortion stance
came during a week in which she has repeatedly blamed him for the
state of New York City's public schools. In addition to criticizing
him on those issues, she unveiled television advertisements this
week that stress her role as a mother and educator and her support
of abortion rights. She also also held a roundtable discussion with
breast cancer patients and visited a child-care center this week.
</P>
<P>
   A third Democratic candidate, James Larocca, said Thursday that
Ms. McCaughey Ross' attempts to woo female voters would not work
because her opponents champion women's rights just as much as she
does. ``To pitch to voters based on gender is offensive,'' he said.
``Abortion won't be an issue on Tuesday because all of us have come
to the same position. The decisions will be made on other issues.''

GEORGES MEYER, 67, FRENCH STORE EXECUTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Georges Meyer, chairman and chief executive of Galeries
Lafayette SA, one of Europe's largest department store chains, died
Sept. 8 at his home in Paris. He was 67.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was myeloma, a form of leukemia, his wife,
Noelle, said.
</P>
<P>
   In a 34-year career with Galeries Lafayette, Meyer's most
visible initiative to many Americans was his opening of the
company's first American store in midtown Manhattan in 1991. But
that store closed after only three years.
</P>
<P>
   In France, Meyer helped build Galeries Lafayette into the
nation's largest retailer, with close to 600 stores. While the
company also has stores in a handful of cities outside France,
including Berlin, Beijing and Tel Aviv, the heart of the company
remains its flagship store on Boulevard Haussmann in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The store, near the Paris Opera, has become a shopping haven for
tourists and locals alike with the slogan ``La mode est la'' _
roughly translated as ``Where the fashion is.''
</P>
<P>
   With nearly 30,000 employees, the company generated sales last
year of 30.4 billion francs, or $5.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer joined the 102-year-old company in 1964 after marrying
into the family that controlled it. Noelle Meyer's grandfather,
Theothile Bader, founded Galeries Lafayette in 1896 as a boutique
selling such novelties as feathers, ribbons and decorative sewing
products.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer became a vice president of the company in 1970 and assumed
the chairman's job in the late 1980s, although Mrs. Meyer said her
husband was functionally running the company by the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Roanne, France, in 1930, Meyer began his career in the
textile industry in northern France and joined a textile company in
Medellin, Colombia, in 1957. He met his wife-to-be while on a home
visit to France.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the family shareholders who control Galeries Lafayette
asked the company's two vice chairmen, Philippe Houze and Philippe
Lemoine, to fulfill Meyer's duties jointly until management options
could be considered at the company's next board meeting.
</P>
<P>
   After taking the reins at Galeries Lafayette, Meyer directed the
company on an aggressive path of expansion. In the early 1990s,
Galeries Lafayette acquired Nouvelles Galeries Reunies, another
French retail group, and assumed full control of an older
affiliate, the Monoprix chain of discount stores.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps Meyer's most ambitious plan was to build a
successful shop in the middle of Manhattan's intensely competitive
shopping district.
</P>
<P>
   The new Galeries Lafayette store opened in September 1991, with
a celebrity-spangled party at the 80,000-square-foot store in the
base of Trump Tower, on 57th Street between Fifth Avenue and
Madison Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   But the New York operation lost $20 million in each of its first
two years, and in 1994 Meyer closed the store, ending his company's
presence in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always in love with America,'' Mrs. Meyer said in a
telephone interview Wednesday. ``But that period was not the best
for us because we had to manage expansion inside France, and we
could not really take good care of the New York department store.
He thought maybe we were not French enough there.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyer, a commander of France's Legion of Honor, is survived by
his wife; a brother, Max, of Paris; a sister, Janyne, of the
Vaucluse region in southern France; three sons, Alexandre, of
Marseilles, David, of Brussels, and Raphael, of Paris, and one
grandchild.

CHARLIE FEATHERS, 66, A ROCKABILLY ORIGINAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn., Miss.)   (bl)  
 By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charlie Feathers, one of the great original rockabilly singers,
died Aug. 29 at St. Francis Hospital in Memphis, Tenn. He was 66
and lived in Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from a stroke, his wife, Rosemary,
said.
</P>
<P>
   On his best records of the mid- and late 1950s, released on the
Sun, Meteor and King labels, Feathers' voice is completely original
_ a trembling, high, humid plaint.
</P>
<P>
   He sang classic songs that defined the meeting place of
honky-tonk, bluegrass and rockabilly, including ``You're Right, I'm
Left, She's Gone'' (which Elvis Presley recorded for Sun),
``Defrost Your Heart,'' ``One Hand Loose'' and _ perhaps the most
prized record of rockabilly enthusiasts _ ``Tongue Tied Jill.''
</P>
<P>
   That song _ about a ``real gone chick'' with a speech problem,
which Feathers demonstrated in its babbling chorus _ was born from
his conversation with a stammering telephone operator.
</P>
<P>
   But his records sold poorly, and historians of American music
have recounted Feathers' career as a question: Why didn't Feathers,
with all his talent, attain any of the fame of Sun records
label-mates like Carl Perkins and Jerry Lee Lewis?
</P>
<P>
   It could have been his voice, which was slightly too hiccupingly
and shriekingly radical for mass consumption.
</P>
<P>
   It could have been his rudimentary education; he was barely
literate.
</P>
<P>
   Some thought it was his character, often described as brash and
aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   Feathers always insisted, contrary to other accounts, that he
was intimately involved in many of Presley's early songs, as
arranger and sometimes as writer. His only writing credit for a
Presley song was a shared one, on ``I Forgot to Remember to Forget.
</P>
<P>
   There was no question, however, of his talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the blues feeling that he put into a hillbilly song,'' Sam
Phillips, the head of Sun records, has said, ``Charlie should have
been just a superb top country artist. He could have been the
George Jones of his day _ a superb stylist.''
</P>
<P>
   Feathers was born near Holly Springs, Miss., and grew up in a
family of tenant farmers. He took guitar lessons from Junior
Kimbrough, the blues singer, who lived on a nearby farm.
</P>
<P>
   Having left school by the age of 10, he worked on oil pipelines
with his father in Illinois and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   He settled in Memphis in 1950, and his first recording, on the
Flip label, was ``I've Been Deceived,'' in 1955. By 1960, after
about a dozen singles, his career was lagging.
</P>
<P>
   He persevered, and eventually European rockabilly fans
discovered him. After the broadcast of a British television
documentary, he did a concert at the Rainbow Theater in London in
1977 that was recorded by EMI; this raised his stock considerably,
but by then he was classified as an oldies performer.
</P>
<P>
   In later years, Feathers played locally around Memphis, often in
a band with his son and daughter. His final album, self-titled, was
recorded in 1991 for Elektra/Nonesuch as part of the label's
Explorer series. ``Get With It: Essential Recordings 1954-69,'' a
reissue of his greatest moments, was just released by Revenant.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Feathers is survived by his sons,
Charles (Bubba) Jr., and Ricky , both of Memphis; a daughter, Wanda
Vanzant of Memphis; five brothers, Olton, of Memphis; V.A., of
Pottscamp, Miss.; Herbert, of Holly Spring, Miss.; Lawrence, of
Olive Branch, Miss., and Darnell, of South Haven, Miss, and three
grandchildren.

WALTER ADAMS, 78, EXPERT ON CORPORATE POWER AND ANTITRUST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)   (bl)  
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Walter Adams, an antitrust expert whose concerns about
concentrations of corporate power helped shape government policy
for three decades, died Sept. 10 at his home in East Lansing,
Mich., according to a statement from Michigan State University,
where he taught for 46 years. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   His son, William James Adams of Ann Arbor, Mich., said the cause
was pancreatic cancer. Professor Adams learned in May that he had
the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Adams taught economics at Michigan State from 1947 to
1993 and served as president of the university for nine months in
1969, a time when antiwar and civil rights protests rocked the
campus. He addressed those issues with such candor and good humor
that more than 20,000 students and 950 faculty members signed a
petition asking him to stay on as president. But he said he wanted
to teach, not be an administrator.
</P>
<P>
   John Kenneth Galbraith, the Harvard University economist,
praised Adams as a ``wonderful teacher'' who was ``a good New Deal
liberal.''
</P>
<P>
   He served on a federal committee that Attorney General Herbert
Brownell formed in 1953 to study antitrust laws, and he spent many
summers in Washington volunteering his expertise to congressional
committees in an era when they had little or no staff.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote or co-wrote 14 books warning of the dangers of
concentrated economic power, including ``The Bigness Complex'' in
1987 and ``Dangerous Pursuits: Mergers &AMP; Acquisitions in the Age of
Wall Street'' in 1989, both with Prof. James W. Brock of Miami
University of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``He raised enduring questions of power and control in economics
and in the closely related political arena as well,'' Brock said.
``He kept alive a concern about excessive concentration of power
and its dangers to a free society because it undermines good
economic performance, retards innovation and tends to spread into
the political sphere in lobbying aimed at creating anti-competitive
public policies. He taught that we can't rest easy in the delusion
that the unfettered free market will take care of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams was sharply critical of the Reagan administration for
allowing big corporate mergers. In 1988 he wrote that ``the
antitrust laws have been subjected to a systematic policy of
euthanasia.''
</P>
<P>
   But William Baxter, a Stanford University law professor who was
the Reagan administration's antitrust chief for three years, said
concern about industries in which a handful of companies can set
``administered prices'' and operate insulated from supply and
demand ``has gone from the predominant point of view to an
idiosyncratic point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Judge Robert Bork, who is an antitrust expert and several
times jousted with Adams, said ``he saw concentration of industries
everywhere and tended to think that industries I would think were
perfectly competitively structured were not competitively
structured.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter Adams was born in 1922 in Vienna. His family moved to
Brooklyn in 1935. He graduated magna cum laude from Brooklyn
College in 1942 with an economics degree and also studied at the
University of Chicago. He earned his doctorate at Yale University
in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   In World War II he served in the 83rd Infantry Division,
fighting in the Battle of the Bulge, and in the 11th Armored
Division. He received a battlefield commission as a lieutenant and
the Bronze Star. He often described his war experiences as ``the
Tour de France sans bicyclette.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams' playful side showed in an otherwise dry report in 1963
for the Senate Antitrust and Monopoly subcommittee on oligopolies.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lanzillotti, who was then the economics chairman at
Michigan State and co-author of the report, said, ``We wanted to
deal with those economists who saw no merit in the theory of
administered prices and who frequently supported their position by
citing research that their graduate students were doing but that
was not complete or published.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams added a footnote on a study of the relationship of prices
and profits by Hubertus von und Swickenstein and Boris
Przmysy-Watson. Though the names were fictitious and the ruse had
been reported, other researchers asked him how to get in touch with
the pair.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son, he is survived by his wife, Pauline, and
two grandsons.
</P>
<P>
   His last book, ``The Tobacco Wars,'' written with Professor
Brock, was published last week by South-Western College Publishing
of Cincinnati. It was their third book to use the form of a play to
teach economics.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, after word of Adams' illness became known around
the Michigan State campus, more than 200 musicians in the college
marching band, which he had supported for a half-century, came to
his home to play the university fight song and alma mater for him.

</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Sept. 11:
</P>
<P>
   The House of Representatives' plan to release a large portion of
Kenneth Starr's report is correct because it recognizes the need
for the public to reach an informed decision about President
Clinton's conduct in office and his political fate. House Speaker
Newt Gingrich's call for decorous, fair debate is also encouraging
and an affirmation of Congress' ability to avoid partisan warfare
during times of national crisis.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, some peril in putting so much potentially
salacious material on the public record, but this is a necessary
step in dealing with the extraordinary mess created by Clinton's
recklessness and his decision to lie repeatedly to his staff, his
Cabinet, congressional Democrats and the American people.
</P>
<P>
   In our society, information is the antidote for political
dysfunction. Friday will be a moment of maximum risk for Clinton,
and it is therefore important that no one rush to a conclusion
before the report has been fully studied. It is a time, as Gingrich
said, to ``take a deep breath and allow the facts to lead us.''
</P>
<P>
   Facts, of course, are what the Democratic senators were
demanding in their meeting with Clinton on Thursday. Clinton has
clearly underestimated how seriously other political professionals
take being lied to eyeball to eyeball. Sen. Barbara Mikulski said
it was important that ``the president not engage in any more
stonewalling.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Mike McCurry, who has so loyally preserved that wall,
seemed grumpy Thursday at the misleading work he has done for
Clinton. Asked why the senators had referred so specifically to the
stonewall, McCurry said, ``They probably referred to our inability
to provide straightforward answers for eight months now.''
</P>
<P>
   Such expressions of disenchantment show what a struggle Clinton
faces to establish himself as a leader who can be believed. They
also prove the folly of any president ignoring the fact that in
Washington everything comes out sooner or later, and stonewalls
always collapse on their builders.
</P>
<P>
   To a large degree, Clinton's immediate prospects depend on
whether he can hold the Democrats. House Democratic Whip David
Bonior and Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle have not bolted. But
their expressions of loyalty could hardly be more conditional.
Their responses underscore the reality that this presidency is on
tenterhooks.
</P>
<P>
   There has been little in Clinton's recent conduct to admire. But
fairness dictates that he be given a full chance to rebut the
allegations in Starr's report. There are, meanwhile, reasons for
pride in Congress' initial handling of the Starr report and in the
Democratic leadership's attempts to discipline their president
toward greater truthfulness and contrition.
</P>
<P>
   There is reason for encouragement, too, in the fact that after
months of squabbling and stonewalling, the public will at long last
get a chance to judge Starr's account and Clinton's response to it.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Sept. 11:
</P>
<P>
   If urbanity, longevity and familiarity with international issues
were the qualities most needed for Russia's next prime minister,
Yevgeny Primakov would be admirably suited for the job. Few
officials are as well versed in Kremlin politics as Primakov, who
has served in senior national security posts under every Russian
leader going back to Leonid Brezhnev two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   But since a commitment to democracy and reform are more
essential for Russia's future, his selection Wednesday by President
Boris Yeltsin looks more like an act of desperation than an act of
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of Primakov was dictated by parliamentary opposition
to Yeltsin's first choice, Viktor Chernomyrdin, no paragon of
reform in a previous tour as prime minister. Rather than
challenging a truculent legislature and calling new elections,
which would have prolonged the political crisis in Moscow, Yeltsin
turned to a man who was acceptable to the Communist-dominated body.
Primakov earned that trust through years of loyal party service
during the Soviet period and close ties to the KGB. After the
Soviet Union collapsed he ran the foreign intelligence agency that
replaced the KGB and since 1996 has been foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov is no ideologue, as his smooth transition from one
leader and era to the next would suggest. He can be charming, wryly
amusing and cold-bloodedly pragmatic. But Russians should not look
to him for new reform programs.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he is likely to assemble a coalition government and try
to steady the economy through the kind of state intervention that
over time crippled the Soviet Union. The question is whether
Primakov will do so cautiously and within the framework of a market
system, or try to wrench Russia back toward a managed economy,
which would stunt the prospects for recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov may also harden Russian foreign policy in areas like
the Balkans and the Middle East, where he has already opposed U.S.
positions as foreign minister. His reputation as a defender of
Russian interests has served him well in a nation soured on
capitalism and increasingly wary of Washington's policy
prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov should bring a measure of stability to a country
verging on anarchy. He at least commands the respect of many of his
fellow politicians and countrymen, which is more than can be said
of Yeltsin. His other attraction to the political heavyweights
hoping to succeed Yeltsin is that Primakov, 68, seems to have no
interest in running for president himself. Such are the
calculations that pass for leadership in Moscow these days.  &QL;

<P>
   Why does  &UR; Courtney Love &LR;  hate  &UR; Tina Brown &LR; ? Probably because the
former New Yorker editor published an essay in which the sincerity
of Love's metamorphosis from punk to dignified sex symbol was
maligned.
</P>
<P>
   And how does Courtney Love hate Tina Brown?
</P>
<P>
   In an online interview for SonicNet, the eloquent Love
proclaimed herself part of a ``small little generation, which, if
we don't gain control and power, the Tina Browns and the  &UR; Paul &LR;

So there's got to be ambition in this generation, real ambition.
Not like I want to take over the world, but I want to take over the
world on my terms and make a building that people can actually go.
That there's a toilet in, instead of a port-a-potty outside.'' all
cq &LR;
</P>
<P>
   And in an interview in Spin, Love speculated on Brown's move
into the movies. ``Someone told me she's coming out here to head a
studio,'' said L.A.-bound Love. ``Not on my f_ time she's not. She
enters the 213 area code, I'm going to throw her right the f_ back

<P>
   Why does  &UR; Courtney Love &LR;  hate  &UR; Tina Brown &LR; ? Probably because the
former New Yorker editor published an essay in which the sincerity
of Love's metamorphosis from punk to dignified sex symbol was
maligned.
</P>
<P>
   And how does Courtney Love hate Tina Brown?
</P>
<P>
   In an online interview for SonicNet, the eloquent Love
proclaimed herself part of a ``small little generation, which, if
we don't gain control and power, the Tina Browns and the  &UR; Paul &LR; 
 &UR; Allen &LR; s, the Boomers will influence the minds of all 16-year-olds.
So there's got to be ambition in this generation, real ambition.
Not like I want to take over the world, but I want to take over the
world on my terms and make a building that people can actually go.
That there's a toilet in, instead of a port-a-potty outside.'' all
cq &LR;
</P>
<P>
   And in an interview in Spin, Love speculated on Brown's move
into the movies. ``Someone told me she's coming out here to head a
studio,'' said L.A.-bound Love. ``Not on my f_ time she's not. She
enters the 213 area code, I'm going to throw her right the f_ back
out.''

 Safeway, Union Should Stop Posturing Over Greeting Policy   By Mark Veverka  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Safeway union workers may have legitimate beefs about the company's
new customer service guidelines, but the complaints are not reason
to scrap the program.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite the numerous calls and missives trying to persuade me
otherwise, I steadfastly feel Safeway is wise to continue its drive
for better customer service.
</P>
<P>
   However, top management needs to place labor-management
posturing aside and listen to what its employees and customers are
trying to tell them.
</P>
<P>
   Without a doubt, reader response to the Labor Day column on the
grocer's rift with local unions over its controversial customer
service initiatives was pointed and passionate.
</P>
<P>
   The crux of the controversy is the company's 20-step program
that requires employees to smile, greet customers and yes, (the
company came clean) make eye contact with shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   It was nearly impossible to respond to every letter or call
about the column. So, I'll try to address some of the issues raised
by readers the best I can.
</P>
<P>
   Let me start by saying I received a telephone call from Oakland
attorney Matthew Ross, who represents two United Food &AMP; Commercial
Workers unions in Martinez and Vallejo. In short, Ross called to
tell me I had it all wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unions don't quarrel with employees being friendly. What's
causing them problems is the rigidity of its program,'' he said.
``Some managers take the (program) to excess.``
</P>
<P>
   Ross may have a point. He represents UFCW Locals 1179 and 373,
which have taken their complaints to management and federal
authorities. As Ross tells it, employees have been fired for not
smiling, asked to place their safety at risk and experienced a rise
in sexual harassment as a result of the company's customer-friendly
initiatives. The company denies the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   However, if even some of the anecdotal evidence &LR;   &LR; Ross provides
is true, the company should consider altering their policies to
assure their employees' dignity and safety.
</P>
<P>
   One example, which has been told and retold, is that of a young
female clerk being forced by a manager to assist two able-bodied
men to their car with their purchase, which was a single bag of
charcoal.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Ross says, pleaded with her supervisor (a low-level
manager) to make an exception and relieve her of the task. Despite
her fear and trepidation about helping the men to their car (who,
needless to say, didn't need help), the supervisor would not
relent.
</P>
<P>
   The unsavory result: the woman was propositioned and harassed in
the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Safeway doesn't dispute the incident. Company
policy cites that all customers should be offered help with their
groceries. The written policy requires that all customers be
offered help because it protects the company from potential racial
and gender discrimination charges, says Safeway's Larree Renda,
senior vice president of retail operations.
</P>
<P>
   But in this case, the supervisor at the store in question made
the wrong decision. ``The over-riding policy is to use common
sense. And that manager was not following our policy and
guidelines. And that's not good,'' Renda says.
</P>
<P>
   Renda admits that there have been a smattering of incidents
where managers may not have used ``good judgment at the store
level.'' And when headquarters learns of such ``isolated
instances,'' management reprimands the supervisor and tries to
correct the problem. But she maintains, overall, that the customer
service initiatives have improved worker morale and that employees
like the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have the right set of guidelines, and allow enough
flexibility in them to make them work,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Renda, who started as a bagger and a clerk before working her
way to top management, knows what it is like to be harassed by
customers. But she doesn't think that the customer service policies
are to blame for recent incidents, by and large.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did people hit on me? You bet. Unfortunately, (hitting on
clerks) has been happening forever. And it will happen for a long
time to come,'' Renda says.
</P>
<P>
   ``(But) does it happen because of people being greeted (by
employees)? I think not,'' she adds.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, how Safeway has written its policy _ and how mangers
have interpreted it _ leaves room for imperfection. In reality, the
customer service guidelines probably need to be softened or store
managers need to give the workers more latitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Safeway had a good idea, and somebody went haywire with it,''
contends the union's Ross. ``What the unions want is some
flexibility in the program and some (provisions) for common
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Some readers have been aghast with one aspect of the customer
service guidelines: the so-called ``secret shopper'' program where
incognito managers masqeurade as shoppers and grade employee
performances and watch for stealing by workers and customers.
</P>
<P>
   While this admittedly smacks of Big Brotherish images, this is
not some dastardly scheme hatched by Safeway. Such undercover
monitors are used by the entire retail industry, including
Safeway's competitors. It's simply a fact of life. Theft and
embezzlement, or ``shrinkage'' in industry jargon, is arguably the
most onerous problem that retailers face today.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, these undercover monitors need not place undue
pressure on employees, which is something Ross alleges and the
company denies.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, to little surprise, the two sides don't agree on much,
which leads me to believe that the truth lies somewhere in the
middle. Safeway's guidelines and their implementation by managers
continue to need tweaking and reassessment in order to not only be
safe and decent, but to be effective with customers.
</P>
<P>
   However, if this was the start of a widespread revolt over this
issue by local Safeway unions across the country and the
international UFCW leadership in Washington, D.C., then there would
be reason to believe that problems with the policies are more
epidemic in proportion.
</P>
<P>
   Ross maintains that the vocal oppostion to the program from the
East Bay is the beginning of a grassroots reform movement within
the union.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Safeway considers the allegations by the local unions
as political grandstanding.
</P>
<P>
   So what you have is not a debate over customer service
guidelines but an old fashion labor-management hissing match. In
the end, if the employees are under pressure and their mandatory
salutations at the store appear forced and insincere, shoppers will
ultimately dictate whether the consumer initiatives have fallen
short. They will vote with their pocket-books and book on over to
Lucky or Trader Joe's. Safeway isn't likely to let that happen.

 &HT;    Networks antsy for news as 'secrets' come spilling out
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer and Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the REALLY BIG STORY still under lock and key for another
agonizing news cycle, television coverage of President Clinton's
troubles Thursday was all revved up with no place to go.
</P>
<P>
   The voluminous Starr report was supposed to be a more closely
guarded secret than who shot J.R. Ewing, but surprise! Just about
every television news outlet covering the story somehow
``obtained'' unattributed information about its contents.
</P>
<P>
   Who was leaking what to whom is anybody's guess, and in truth,
everyone on the tube was just guessing anyway about perjury,
obstruction of justice and witness tampering. There wasn't much
news to go around, and viewers were seeing what the networks
couldn't get: the Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't stop CNN from trying to get a little news going,
even though the newsmakers weren't particularly cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore surfaced at a Democratic fund-raiser?
Quick, let's get him up on the screen. Oh, wait, he's doing some
jokes about ``43 Signs Technology Has Taken Over Your Life.''
Fortunately, he only read four of them and didn't bother mentioning
Kenneth Starr or Monica Lewinsky one single time. Back to the
studio.
</P>
<P>
   Then first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton popped up to give a
speech about colon cancer, just colon cancer, and only colon
cancer. By nightfall, local and national newscasts had cobbled
together breathless retrospectives about ``The Ghosts of
Watergate,'' attempting to find parallels between Richard Nixon's
political implosion 24 years ago and Clinton's current meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   The president was seen briefly around midday offering his daily
apologia while speaking to a group of scientists, then again later
Thursday evening during a live broadcast on the White House lawn.
He wanted to announce a tentative agreement in the Northwest
Airlines strike, but none of the reporters seemed to notice.
</P>
<P>
   Then, just like that, Clinton clammed up and walked away. When a
reporter shouted after him about the possibility of his
resignation, Clinton looked over his shoulder, half sneering, half
smiling, and saying nothing. All that revving and so little
progress. Thursday was pretty much a wasted day for TV. Today, when
the Starr report is expected to be released, probably will be a
very different story.

 &HT;    Madonna brings a ``Ray of Light'' to the MTV Awards
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most awards show pretend to be about something and end up
bloated, meaningless ego festivals with scarce entertainment value.
The MTV Music Video Awards are pretty blatantly about nothing --
does anyone care or remember who wins? -- which is actually a
liberating thing.
</P>
<P>
   The three-hour show, which was beamed live Thursday night from
the Universal Amphitheatre in Los Angeles, is at once a celebration
and a send-up of pop star artifice and the eye-popping media
overload that MTV ably assisted in making a staple of American
life. It's a sophisticated in-joke, like a better than average
episode of ``Saturday Night'' but with more music and an hour too
long. Oh, yeah, and some dumb awards show stuff, too.
</P>
<P>
   Best performances: Madonna, whose ``Ray of Light'' won for best
female video and best directed video, flexed her ever-muscular
biceps as she indulged in Hindu schtick (having, for the moment,
exhausted Judeo-Christian schtick) in a performance of the
techno-influenced song. Her evil twin, Courtney Love, led her band
Hole through a crunching, self-aware version of ``Celebrity Skin''
(also the title of Hole's new album) whose acid lyrics could have
been directed at many of the nominees. She ended the song with a
few doctored lines from R.E.M.'s ``Pretty Persuasion.''
</P>
<P>
   But the most fun was New Orleans hip-hop honcho Master P and his
No Limit crew -- including new hire Snoop Dogg -- romping through a
largely unintelligible version of the hit ``Make 'em Say Uhhh.''
The song is idiocy, but its crude energy offset the pomp of the
other production numbers. Also, along with numbers from the Fugees'
Pras Michael (with Wyclef Jean, Mya and Old Dirty Bastard) and the
Beastie Boys, it illustrates how definitively hip-hop culture has
become the new rock'n'roll.
</P>
<P>
   Notable gags: Host Ben Stiller interrupted by his dad Jerry
(late of ``Seinfeld,'' where he played Costanza's obnoxious pop),
hectoring from a video screen. An opening ``documentary,''
featuring ``South Park'' creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone,
detailing the exploits of a renegade Backstreet Boy (and a little
too tasteless and low-brow to recall here). Ben Stiller stage
diving. A claymation version of Celine Dion having her arms ripped
off, but gamely relying on head butts, in an awards segment of
MTV's ``Celebrity Death Match.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of sorta funny lines: Ben Stiller: ``These next two
presenters make that whole feminism thing easier to take. Here are
Sarah McLachlan and Natalie Imbruglia!''
</P>
<P>
   Natalie Imbruglia, accepting the award for Best New Artist in a
Video: ``I'm a very happy bunny.''
</P>
<P>
   Best commercial: Spots for Gus Van Sant Jr.'s remake of
``Psycho.''
</P>
<P>
   Pee Wee Herman Memorial Comeback Award: Geri Halliwell (the
artist formerly known as Ginger Spice) who made her return to
public view as the show's final presenter.
</P>
<P>
   MTV Music Video Award winners:
</P>
<P>
   Male Video: Will Smith, ``Just the Two of Us.''
</P>
<P>
   Group Video: Backstreet Boys, ``Everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   New Artist in a Video: Natalie Imbruglia
</P>
<P>
   Video From a Film: Aerosmith, ``I Don't Want To Miss a Thing.''

DODGERS FIND SOLUTION AGAINST BROWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Chan Ho Park admits he secretly roots for the great
ones, and for six innings Thursday afternoon no one was greater
than Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Park was facing Brown, who was facing history when he retired
the first 18 Dodgers with stuff so nasty he buckled knees and
rattled nerves.
</P>
<P>
   But quicker than he blew through the Dodgers order, Brown's
perfect game and victory were gone. And watching it all was Park,
who had more perseverance than perfection in a 4-3 victory over the
San Diego Padres in front of 26,018 at Qualcomm Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to see the hard throwers,'' said Park, who walked
seven, but still was hitting 95 mph on the radar gun in his seventh
and final inning. ``The guys said they'd never seen anyone so good.
You watch a guy like Kevin Brown and John Smoltz and you learn
something every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Park, who threw 136 pitches for the second consecutive game,
learned that if he hung around long enough maybe he'd be the one to
catch a break.
</P>
<P>
   Through six, it looked like Brown held all the strings. He
caught a vicious line drive off the bat of Eric Young to open the
fourth. Brown even got the game's first hit, but was erased on a
fielder's choice to avoid getting tired.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, though, got theirs in the top of the seventh when
Young reached on a slow roller to third.
</P>
<P>
   Young thought he beat the throw for the first hit of the game.
The scoreboard operator thought so, too, putting a big one in the
Dodgers hit column. The official scorer, however, ruled it was an
error.
</P>
<P>
   The no-hitter was still on, but something had changed. Brown's
invincibility was gone. Trenidad Hubbard walked and Eric Karros hit
a high chopper to third that became the Dodgers first official hit.
The shutout was gone when Bobby Bonilla lined a long two-run single
off the right-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   Brown retired the next two batters, but Mark Grudzielanek then
singled between short and third, scoring two more runs. Brown
(18-6) then got the next seven Dodgers to record his seventh
complete game.
</P>
<P>
   He also struck out 11 to set a Padres record with 238, and many
think his string of 15 consecutive starts without a loss (11-0,
four no decisions between May 26 and Aug. 5) is the reason the
Padres have run away with the National League West.
</P>
<P>
   But even if he goes on to win the Cy Young Award, as expected,
then signs a huge free-agent contract next winter, he is sure to
remember this one.
</P>
<P>
   Brown didn't want to talk about his performance after the game,
but everyone else did.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla, a teammate in Baltimore and against last year in
Florida when Brown pitched a no-hitter against San Francisco, said
Brown on Thursday was the most unhittable pitcher he ever has
faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different to play behind him and bat against him,''
Bonilla said. ``If (Young) didn't get on to open the inning, I
think he would have pitched a perfect game.''
</P>
<P>
   Padres pitching coach Dave Stewart said he hasn't seen a pitcher
since Nolan Ryan bring Brown's no-hit potential to every start.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can tell me who deserves the Cy Young Award more than
this guy,'' Stewart said, ``I want to meet him.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown had Park's vote. Park (13-8) struggled throughout and had
particular trouble in the third inning when he allowed all three
Padres runs. San Diego sent nine batters to the plate that inning
and Park's pitch count already was 70.
</P>
<P>
   The big hit was a two-out, two-run single by Wally Joyner. Park
also allowed a run when the Padres pulled their first successful
double steal in six years. And even though Brown was rolling, there
was a turning point.
</P>
<P>
   After getting the second out, Park walked three, allowed a
single and hit a batter. Then former Dodgers catcher Carlos
Hernandez came up and popped out on the first pitch to end the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Park walked two in the sixth and avoided more problems in the
seventh after Ed Giavanola walked and Greg Vaughn reached on an
infield single. Joyner lined to Grudzielanek, who then saved a run
by stopping Mark Sweeney's grounder in the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Park struck out George Arias, his 10th of the game. On his 136th
pitch, he got Hernandez on a fielder's choice to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Radinsky struck out three in the eighth, although one
reached base on a passed ball by Charles Johnson. Jeff Shaw then
struck out the side for his 42nd save and 19th as a Dodger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very tired,'' said Park, who threw 136 pitches last
Saturday in a complete-game victory over San Francisco. ``But when
you win a game like this, you don't feel a thing.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hillary Rodham Clinton declared her pride and
admiration for her husband Thursday night, after President Clinton
spent much of the day offering emotional apologies to senators and
Cabinet secretaries for misleading them over his relationship with
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing with the president at a gathering of Democratic donors
here Thursday night, Mrs. Clinton gave him a rousing introduction,
saying that he had ``given faith again to people all over our
country, that the American dream can mean what it should mean.''
She praised his ``unrelenting determination to do what is best for
America.''
</P>
<P>
   The president hugged her as he stepped to the lectern, and,
beaming, she patted his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only hope you know what I'm feeling, for you and for my
wife and for my country,'' Clinton said. ``I think you do, and I
thank you more than you can possibly know.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's spokesman said Thursday that the first lady
``stresses her support, her love and her forgiveness'' for her
husband. Previous statements expressed love and support, but this
was the first to use the word forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton waged the second day of a campaign of contrition to
shore up support for his presidency, his aides braced for the
disclosure on Friday of the prosecutors' report about his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. They had been stunned when Kenneth
Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, abruptly delivered his
findings to Congress on Wednesday. The White House plans to hire
two to three people in the next several days to help manage the
proceedings on the Hill, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Described as close to tears, the president promised Senate
Democrats earlier Thursday that he would do all he could to rebuild
their trust and assured them that no more nasty surprises awaited
them about his personal conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Clinton is in some considerable personal pain,'' said
Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The president sat down with his Cabinet secretaries late
Thursday afternoon for their first meeting since Jan. 23, when he
had assured them that he had not had a liaison with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   After that meeting, four of the secretaries marched outside, and
speaking to television cameras, declared that they believed him.
Clinton did not directly refer to that previous meeting,
participants said.
</P>
<P>
   Some secretaries quoted Scripture and most were supportive
though critical of his behavior, participants said. One person who
was present said Donna Shalala, the secretary of Health and Human
Services, had told Clinton that she was appalled by his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, though she said she still supported
him and his policies.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Cuomo, the secretary of Housing and Urban Development,
said that Clinton ``apologized and said that he owes this group a
special obligation because they have done so much for him. He said
he considered us like family.''
</P>
<P>
   Madeleine Albright, the secretary of State, described the
meeting as ``very sober and very moving.'' She had emerged from the
meeting in January to say, ``I believe the allegations are
completely untrue.'' Thursday night, she said that she told Clinton
that this was a ``sad and difficult time.'' She said that she
accepted his apology and did not express any frustration at having
defended him publicly before. ``I don't have that feeling,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright and the three others who appeared before the cameras in
January did not do so again Thursday. Instead, her aides offered
her for brief interviews later. One of those four, Commerce
Secretary William Daley, did not attend the meeting. White House
aides said he had a conflict out of town.
</P>
<P>
   One participant said that some secretaries left the meeting
still angry. ``Different people were in different places,'' this
Cabinet secretary said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Some
remained judgmental.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cabinet meeting followed a session late Thursday morning
with Senate Democrats, a replay of a meeting Clinton held Wednesday
morning with congressional Democrats in the same room, the Yellow
Oval Room of the White House residence.
</P>
<P>
   After just two days, such meetings have taken on a ritualistic
quality. White House aides and senators said the president
apologized and said he would do all he could to win back the
senators' trust, he absorbed their criticisms and anger, and he
tried to allay their fretting over the possibility of more damaging
disclosures.
</P>
<P>
   But the senators warned Clinton that impeachment was a
possibility. Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., told Clinton that he was now
facing a political rather than a legal process, one person who was
present said. The House would follow the country, Kerrey said, so
the president would have to retain his popular support to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``People gave very frank assessments,'' Torricelli said,
``making clear that the situation could not be sustained if there
were further revelations or if you cannot contradict aspects of the
report.''
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli said Clinton began the meeting by discussing the pain
he had caused his family and his effort to ease it. He said that
Clinton believed ``they'd have a stronger relationship having
survived this crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   After the talk, Sen. Tom Daschle, D-Iowa, the minority leader,
invoked the terminology of modern popular psychology in calling for
national healing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that this process will continue with an expectation
that we can bring it to closure some time in the not-too-distant
future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of the scope of Clinton's political problems
that he feels compelled to address them directly and repeatedly. In
past controversies over matters like his campaign finances, Clinton
preferred to ignore any accusations in the belief that the public
was more interested in his agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used that approach in the months after the Lewinsky
accusations surfaced, and tried it again after acknowledging an
inappropriate relationship on August 17.
</P>
<P>
   But since then, the congressional Democrats whom Clinton needs
to sustain him against possible impeachment hearings have begun to
back away.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a real change in his approach to these problems in
the last few weeks,'' Torricelli said. ``He's gone from being angry
at his accusers to being angry at himself, and there's a marked
transformation, and you can see it in his manners and in his
face.''
</P>
<P>
   White House aides said that the president surprised them by
abandoning his previous, grudging apologies, over the objections of
some hard-line advisers. These aides said that his new approach did
not mark a strategic shift. ``He's just going in and doing it,''
one Clinton aide said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Another one said that Clinton's family, friends and Democratic
colleagues ``have forced him to confront the magnitude of the harm
that he has done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is, he's saying it because he feels it,'' this
adviser said. ``If he didn't feel it, he wouldn't say it, as we
know from the last couple of weeks.'' He compared Clinton's
transformation to passage through four stages of dealing with a
death, saying he had moved from denial, to anger, to acceptance and
a desire to get on with his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said that they expected Clinton to continue apologizing
publicly at future events.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton has become more aggressive in his contrition, his
aides are struggling to devise a defense for him on Capitol Hill.
Two close advisers to the president said that they were searching
for an ``uberlawyer'' to coordinate the work of Clinton's lawyers
and the White House political staff, and act as a trusted
ambassador to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The White House may also add another lawyer to work with a
senior ambassador to Congress and to help coordinate the legal and
political strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought they had two weeks to figure this out,'' said a
Democratic political consultant who has been involved in efforts to
defend the president. ``Instead, they had two days because of the
report going to the Hill.''

 &HT;    Report cites 11 grounds for ouster
 &HT;    By Arthur Brice
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Contending that President Clinton committed perjury, obstructed
justice, tampered with witnesses and abused the power of his office
while trying to hide his affair with Monica Lewinsky, independent
counsel Kenneth Starr's report lays out 11 possible grounds for
impeachment, according to published news reports.
</P>
<P>
   Starr believes that Clinton committed perjury twice: when he
denied the affair in his Jan. 17 deposition in the Paula Jones
sexual harassment lawsuit and during his Aug. 17 testimony before
the prosecutor's federal grand jury, The Washington Post, The New
York Times and The Associated Press said, citing unnamed sources
familiar with the still-sealed report.
</P>
<P>
   According to the news agencies, Starr's report, which was sent
to Congress on Wednesday and is expected to be made public today,
contends Clinton:
</P>
<P>
   Obstructed justice by retrieving gifts he gave to Lewinsky to
avoid a subpoena from Jones' lawyers and by having some of his
associates help find her a job.
</P>
<P>
   Abused the power of his high office by waging court fights to
impede the grand jury investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Tampered with witnesses by lying to his aides, knowing they
would give false testimony to Starr's grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   The 445-page report reportedly recounts about a dozen sexual
encounters between Clinton and the 25-year-old former White House
intern in lurid detail.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, which has not seen the report, dismissed it as
one-sided.
</P>
<P>
   ``The referral by the prosecutors is simply a collection of
their contentions, claims and allegations and we look forward for
the chance to rebut them,'' said Clinton's personal attorney, David
Kendall.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's account reportedly focuses solely on the Lewinsky matter
and does not contain any finding on the independent counsel's
four-year investigation into the Whitewater land deal in Arkansas,
the firing of seven White House travel office employees or the
examination of FBI files on prominent Republicans by Clinton aides.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The report sent to Congress by the Whitewater
independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, contends that evidence shows
that President Clinton committed perjury, obstructed justice,
tampered with witnesses and abused the power of his office in
trying to cover up an affair with Monica Lewinsky, lawyers familiar
with the report said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's 445-page report, however, lists no impeachable offenses
arising from the majority of Starr's four-year-old inquiry on such
matters as the failed Whitewater land deal, the alleged misuse of
FBI files or the alleged coverup in the White House travel office
matter. Lawyers did say the report draws parallels between the
White House conduct in the Lewinsky inquiry and efforts that they
say were made during the Whitewater inquiry to cover up what
actually happened.
</P>
<P>
   The report asserts that Clinton lied during his civil deposition
in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit in January and during
his grand jury testimony last month from the White House, three
lawyers who insisted on anonymity said.
</P>
<P>
   In a 140-page section that outlines possible grounds for
impeachment, prosecutors use graphic descriptions of sexual
encounters to try to contradict Clinton's months-long denial of his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. They also accuse Clinton of abusing
the power of his office by using government resources to attempt to
thwart Starr's inquiry for seven months, the lawyers said. Abuse of
power was one of the impeachment counts leveled against Richard
Nixon in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   That section also outlines Starr's contention that the president
relied on government lawyers and senior aides to deny repeatedly to
the public that Clinton had had an inappropriate or improper
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, the 25-year-old former White House
intern. And, the lawyers said, prosecutors are also critical of the
privilege claims filed by government lawyers to try to block the
grand jury testimony of White House aides and lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also give details that they say show how Clinton
tried to influence the testimony of Ms. Lewinsky and his personal
secretary. They also include evidence that they say demonstrates
that he obstructed justice through trying to help Ms. Lewinsky find
a job and retrieve gifts that had been subpoenaed in the Jones
case.
</P>
<P>
   The long-awaited report, which the House of Representatives
plans to post on the Internet on Friday, is ``a damaging narrative
that reads like a novel,'' one lawyer familiar with its contents
said Thursday. ``It accuses the president of lying and obstructing,
over and over.''
</P>
<P>
   The report culminated an investigation into Clinton that began
on Jan. 12, 1994, under Robert Fiske Jr. and then continued later
that year under Starr.
</P>
<P>
   During a meeting with Senate Democrats at the White House,
Clinton assured them they would find ``no surprises'' in Starr's
report.
</P>
<P>
   David Kendall, the president's lawyer, said Thursday that the
report is nothing more than a collection of prosecutors'
``contentions, claims and allegations and we look forward to the
chance to rebut them.''
</P>
<P>
   A copy of the report was not made available to The New York
Times, but the shape of the report was described in interviews on
Thursday with three lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The referral to Congress of possible impeachable offenses does
not conclude Starr's criminal inquiry. Starr's prosecutors have
grand juries still active, which might pursue criminal charges
against presidential aides whose actions are seen by prosecutors as
aiding a systemic White House abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation of the obstruction of justice portion of the
report is the allegation that Clinton played a pivotal role in an
attempt by his friend, Vernon Jordan, to find Ms. Lewinsky a job in
the private sector last December, the lawyers said. The report also
lays out a case that the president played a role in Ms. Lewinsky's
decision to return several presidential gifts, which had been
sought by a subpoena from Jones' lawyers, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Both actions were intended to keep Ms. Lewinsky from telling the
truth to the Jones lawyers, the prosecutors contend.
</P>
<P>
   In his grand jury testimony, Clinton denied that he had sought
to help Ms. Lewinsky secure a job or retrieve the gifts, his allies
have said.
</P>
<P>
   The report also details the fact that Clinton summoned his
secretary, Betty Currie, to the White House on Sunday, Jan. 18, the
day after Clinton was asked a series of questions about Ms.
Lewinsky in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   In February, a White House official dismissed the Currie meeting
as an effort by the president to ``refresh his recollection'' about
Ms. Lewinsky's visits and other matters. But the report attests
that Clinton asked Ms. Currie questions to try to influence her as
a potential witness in the Jones case, the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors contend that Clinton also tried to interfere with
the Jones lawsuit as early as the summer of 1997, the lawyers said.
In May 1997, the Supreme Court ruled, unanimously, that the Jones
lawsuit would proceed while Clinton was still in office. Within a
week, Mrs. Jones' lawyers had said they would attempt to interview
under oath other women linked to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   That summer, the report says, Clinton asked Ms. Lewinsky to keep
their relationship a secret. That request came six months before
the former White House intern was subpoenaed to testify in the
case, the lawyers said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At a White House meeting in mid-July, the lawyers said, Clinton
also encouraged Ms. Lewinsky to urge her friend and another
potential witness, Linda Tripp, to stay silent about a White House
volunteer, Kathleen Willey, who said she resisted an unwanted
sexual advance from the president just outside the Oval Office. Ms.
Tripp bumped into Ms. Willey shortly after the alleged encounter.
</P>
<P>
   In the 140-page section that lays out the grounds for possible
impeachment proceedings, there are several ``salacious and
detailed'' references to sexual encounters between Clinton and Ms.
Lewinsky inside the president's private study near the Oval Office,
the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer who is familiar with Starr's strategy said that
prosecutors felt they had to include such material in the section
of the report that discusses whether Clinton had lied to the grand
jury. Clinton denied in his grand jury testimony that he lied about
their relationship in his Jones deposition.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 17, Clinton testified to the grand jury that he had
``inappropriate intimate physical contact'' with Ms. Lewinsky. But
he insisted that the contacts did not meet the definition of
``sexual relations'' established in the Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in his address to the nation that evening, Clinton said
his answers in the Jones deposition about Ms. Lewinsky were
``legally accurate,'' though he acknowledged they were misleading.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say in the report, however, that Clinton lied before
the grand jury when he said that his sexual encounters with Ms.
Lewinsky did not constitute ``sexual relations,'' as defined in the
Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors argue that the president's refusal to answer
detailed grand jury questions about sexual encounters with Ms.
Lewinsky compelled prosecutors to ask Ms. Lewinsky to return to the
grand jury in late August. In that session, they asked her more
detailed questions about her contacts with Clinton, the lawyers
said. Many of those details are included in the report, including a
discussion of the blue dress that Ms. Lewinsky turned over to
prosecutors, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As uncomfortable as this topic may be, there was an obligation
to present it,'' one Starr ally said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A three-part definition of ``sexual relations'' was prepared by
Ms. Jones' lawyers before Clinton's Jan. 17 deposition. But in
responding to an objection of Clinton's lawyer, Judge Susan Webber
Wright of U.S. District Court in Little Rock, Ark. limited the
definition from three parts to just Part I:
</P>
<P>
   ``For the purposes of this deposition, a person engages in
`sexual relations' when the person knowingly engages in or causes
contact with the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or
buttocks of any person with an intent to arouse or gratify the
sexual desire of any person.''
</P>
<P>
   But when he was asked in the deposition about Ms. Lewinsky,
Clinton consulted the same definition before he denied that he had
had sexual relations with the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the testimony of Ms. Lewinsky, prosecutors believe that
denial was a lie under oath, the lawyers said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   While working around the clock over the Labor Day weekend and
intensely for the past several weeks, prosecutors had always
intended to file the report ``as quickly as possible,'' one lawyer
said. There was originally a plan to send a referral letter to
Speaker Newt Gingrich and minority leader Richard Gephardt on
Wednesday, followed several days later by the report.
</P>
<P>
   But some lawyers in the office were concerned that Kendall would
file a motion trying to limit the report's contents, or demanding
its early release. For that reason, the referral letter and the
report were sent Wednesday afternoon, at virtually the same time,
with only 15 minutes' warning.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, some staff members of the House Judiciary
Committee had sent signals that they hoped Starr would submit an
executive summary, which could easily be made public. And, lawyers
said Thursday, prosecutors did in fact draw up a draft of an
executive summary, but Starr himself concluded that it was too
argumentative and scrapped the summary's working draft.
