	Serbs Urged To Stay in Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- As the last of the Serbian troops  
pulled out of Kosovo today, the Yugoslav government tried to 
persuade thousands of fleeing Serb civilians to stay in the land 
considered the cradle of their culture. Serb civilians, fearful of 
a newly resurgent Kosovo Liberation Army, have fled the province 
only to find themselves unwelcome in the nation's capital, 
Belgrade. President Slobodan Milosevic, believed to see the Serb 
exodus as a possible pretext for an attempt to unseat him, has 
tried to conceal the problem. His government blocked attempts to 
set up tent cities and has urged the Serbs to return to Kosovo. 

</P>
<P>
	Strong Action Pledged for Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	COLOGNE, Germany (AP) -- Leaders of the world's wealthiest  
countries concluded their annual summit today with a pledge to take 
``strong action'' to stabilize war-torn Kosovo. Russian Boris 
Yeltsin, joining the summit on its final day, declared that he was 
among friends despite being at odds over how to deal with Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic. In a concession to Yeltsin, the final 
communique did not include any language specifically prohibiting 
the delivery of reconstruction aid to Yugoslavia as long as 
Milosevic remains in power. 

</P>
<P>
	Pope Prays for Kosovo Peace  
</P>
<P>
	VATICAN CITY (AP) -- After his bout with the flu, Pope John Paul  
II today turned his attention to some of the world's trouble spots, 
praying that peace holds in Kosovo and that India and Pakistan work 
to end deadly fighting there. John Paul made numerous appeals to 
both Belgrade and NATO during the war to find a peaceful solution 
to the conflict in Yugoslavia. The pope returned to the Vatican on 
Thursday night from a 13-day trip to Poland.

	Stephen King Alert After Surgery  
</P>
<P>
	LEWISTON, Maine (AP) -- Stephen King is alert and cracking jokes  
this morning after undergoing surgery for injuries sustained when 
he was hit by a car while walking near his home. The horror 
novelist underwent several hours of surgery at Central Maine 
Medical Center in Lewiston to ``deal with orthopedic kinds of 
injuries'' after he was struck by a Dodge Caravan yesterday 
afternoon, according to a hospital spokesman. King was conscious 
and alert after he emerged from the operation around 3:30 a.m.

	Timor Group Won't Give Up Weapons  
</P>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- A pro-independence leader in East Timor  
said today his followers will not surrender their weapons as long 
as Indonesian troops remain in the troubled territory. Today is 
scheduled to be the first day of a disarmament period in advance of 
an Aug. 8 referendum that will let East Timorese choose between 
independence and autonomy within Indonesia. Violence between 
pro-independence and pro-Indonesian militias has increased as the 
U.N.-sponsored vote nears.

	IOC Warns of Possible FBI Inquiry  
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee  
warned its members today they could face questioning by the FBI -- 
and possible subpoenas -- in connection with the Salt Lake City 
bribery scandal. IOC director general Francois Carrard told the 
general assembly that the organization will offer legal assistance 
to members traveling to the United States. Carrard noted that 
several members have already been ``interviewed'' by the FBI as it 
investigates the vote-buying allegations surrounding Salt Lake's 
winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games.

	Stars Win Stanley Cup in Triple OT  
</P>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- The Dallas Stars won the National Hockey  
League's Stanley Cup championship early today after ousting the 
Buffalo Sabres 2-1 in a grueling triple-overtime game to win the 
series 4-2. Brett Hull scored on a rebound at 14:51 of the third 
overtime, putting a rebound over weary goaltender Dominik Hasek as 
the Stars won hockey's biggest prize as much by exhaustion as 
execution. Hull ended the second-longest Stanley Cup finals game in 
history with his third goal of the series and third career overtime 
playoff goal.

	Payne Stewart Leads U.S. Open  
</P>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- Payne Stewart birdied the last hole after  
a long, punishing day on Pinehurst No. 2 yesterday to finish the 
third round as the only player under par at the U.S. Open. Stewart 
wound up with a 72 for 1-under 209, taking the lead into the final 
round for the second straight year. Phil Mickelson's 5-foot birdie 
putt on the 18th gave him a 73 and put him one stroke back at 
even-par 210.

<TEXT>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- For the second time, Lee Janzen learned  
it's not easy to be the defending champion at the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Janzen, who won at The Olympic Club in San Francisco a year ago,  
finished a four-day struggle at Pinehurst No. 2 with a 5-over 75 
Sunday and an 18-over 298 for the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	After his first Open victory at Baltusrol in 1993, Janzen failed  
to make the cut the following year. This time, he barely made it to 
the weekend after starting with rounds of 74 and 73. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the guys in contention, maybe they want it a little it  
more than the guy who's just won it,'' Janzen said. ``I enjoyed 
being the champion for a year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Janzen's poor showing extended a tradition at the U.S. Open,  
where the defending champion has failed to seriously contend since 
Curtis Strange won consecutive titles in 1988-89. The only other 
player in the past half-century to win consecutive Opens was Ben 
Hogan in 1950-51. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, I was able to play my practice rounds, go home and  
rest every day,'' Janzen said. ``With all the extra attention this 
year, it's harder to keep your mindset on preparing for the 
tournament. There's a lot of talk about last year's tournament. You 
can't talk about last year and win this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *OPEN SUCCESS:* So you want to play the course where some of the  
world's best players were brought to their knees? 
</P>
<P>
	Pinehurst No. 2 will reopen to the general public Tuesday. The  
cost for a round -- $225. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will spend the next eight weeks tearing (the venue) down,  
which may very well be the most depressing thing in my life,'' 
championship director Jon Wagner said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Wagner gave the event a thumbs up and anticipates the  
USGA will return as soon as possible, probably in eight or nine 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you think of the perfect venue one of the things you need  
is space, which we've got more space than you could ever use,'' 
Wagner said. ``Two, you need a platform or a theater to perform 
that is going to evoke some kind of emotion or passion in people 
that they want to be here to begin with. That's something that 
Pinehurst offers that no other place does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to some dramatic golf staged this week, the  
tournament was a hit at the concession stands. Pinehurst surpassed 
the previous record concession sales of $1.5 million at an Open on 
Saturday with one round left, Wagner said. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things that we didn't anticipate to this degree,  
because people had to drive a little further than was typical, 
instead of eating at their homes everybody was eating here. As a 
result, there was so much more trash than we ever anticipated,'' 
Wagner said. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous concession sales record was set by the 1997 Open at  
Congressional Country Club in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FAST STARTS, SLOW FADES:* An early lead at the Open guarantees  
you nothing -- just ask John Daly or Kaname Yokoo. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly and Yokoo each shot 2-under 68s in Thursday's opening  
round, only to fade fast over the next three rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The two weren't alone.  
</P>
<P>
	While Daly finished last at 29 over and Yokoo was at 21 over,  
Bob Tway, Chris Smith and Larry Mize also started well with 69s, 
but Tway and Smith finished at 23 over and Mize was one shot worse. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WE SURRENDER:* Pinehurst No. 2 played hard this week. Just how  
hard? 
</P>
<P>
	Ask Chris Perry, who crawled on his hands and knees as he  
approached the 18th green. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it would be kind of funny to throw up the surrender  
flag the last 10 feet and just crawl to the green,'' said Perry, 
whose 6-over 76 Sunday left him at 17 over for the four-day event. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was pretty comical and a good laugh, for myself even, but I  
knew that the crowd would like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year at the Olympic Club, three golfers finished at 20 over  
or worse. At No. 2, a whopping 16 golfers who made the cut were 20 
over or worse, including players such as Tom Watson, Tom Kite and 
last week's PGA Tour winner Ted Tryba. 
</P>
<P>
	Tryba was 19 under in winning the FedEx St. Jude Classic. He  
ballooned to 28 over this week -- a swing of 47 strokes. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FORGOTTEN ROUND:* While the leaders battled it out down the  
stretch, the forgotten round of the final day belonged to Dudley 
Hart. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart's 1-under 69 was one of just two sub-par rounds Sunday.  
Hart's clutch round moved him from a tie for 46th on Saturday to 
17th. Vijay Singh also shot a 69. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart played the final 16 holes in a remarkable 4 under after  
starting double-bogey and bogey on the first two holes. 
</P>
<P>
	``On this course you can't really get too frustrated,'' said  
Hart, who finished at 11 over. ``If you lose your composure a 
little bit you can shoot sky-high.''

<HEADLINE> Validity of Hull's Goal Explained </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- The NHL found itself embroiled in a goal  
controversy involving its man-in-the-crease rule at the worst 
possible time, in the sixth and final game of the Stanley Cup 
finals on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The official response: This one counts because the player had  
full control of the puck. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett Hull scored to give Dallas a 2-1 victory in triple  
overtime and the Stanley Cup championship, but the Buffalo Sabres 
claimed it was an illegal goal because Hull had his skate in the 
crease. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan Lewis, the NHL's director of officiating, said the goal  
counted because Hull ``had control of the puck, and it didn't 
matter that his skate was in the crease.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We determined that Hull played the puck, had possession of the  
puck and the goal was good,'' Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	``His foot was in first. Our immediate reaction was that it  
didn't matter. Our view was that he had control. Hull was in 
possession and control of the puck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL has been studying the possibility of changing the rule.  
The rule disallows a goal if an offensive player has any part of 
his body in the goalie crease. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis, appearing at a news conference, insisted that Hull had  
possession of the puck, even though it bounced off Buffalo 
goaltender Dominik Hasek. He said as soon as the goal was scored, 
off-ice officials immediately went to the video replay for a 
review. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every such goal has been reviewed by the NHL since the start  
of the season, including this one,'' Lewis said.

<HEADLINE> Politics Still Shaping IOC Choices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *AP Sports Analysis    	
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Business as usual in the International  
Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Six months after a scandal threatened to topple the IOC, the  
organization has weathered the crisis and moved into a new era of 
reform and openness. 
</P>
<P>
	But some things are slow to change. And, as the IOC session in  
Seoul illustrated, one thing remains constant: It's all about 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
	The weeklong meetings revealed that many IOC members still have  
not fully come to terms with the Olympics' biggest scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Several members complained it was unfair for them to take so  
much blame. Anti-American sentiment and resentment toward 
organizers in Sydney and Salt Lake City were apparent. 
</P>
<P>
	But IOC members spoke loudest at the ballot box.  
</P>
<P>
	The election of Turin, Italy, as the host city for the 2006  
Winter Olympics was motivated by political factors far removed from 
the quality of the hockey rinks or ski slopes. 
</P>
<P>
	While the 2006 bidding and selection procedures were modified  
following the Salt Lake vote-buying scandal, that didn't stop 
frantic lobbying and back-room dealing from playing a decisive 
role. 
</P>
<P>
	Turin's stunning 53-36 defeat of Sion -- the longtime favorite --  
was a stinging rebuke to Switzerland, the IOC's home country, and 
to Marc Hodler, the Swiss IOC member who fueled the scandal in 
December with his accusations of Olympic corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swiss cried foul, charging they were victims of a backlash,  
that the IOC had ignored its own evaluation reports suggesting that 
Sion was the superior bid. 
</P>
<P>
	But electing Olympic host cities has never been purely about  
technical issues. It's about emotional factors, voting blocs and 
power struggles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody cares about the ski jump venue,'' Turin bid leader  
Evelina Christillin said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Hodler factor certainly hurt Sion, the Swiss also hurt  
themselves. According to interviews with numerous IOC members, bid 
delegates and other Olympic officials, the Swiss were perceived as 
arrogant and overconfident. 
</P>
<P>
	``For them it was like a one-country crusade,'' Christillin  
said. ``They behaved like crusaders. That may not have been the 
right approach. They had no opponents for so long and they were so 
sure they would win. When we joined the race, they underestimated 
us a little bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Sion mobilized Switzerland behind the candidacy, Turin  
played a low-key campaign. The Italians deliberately avoided the 
hype of Rome's bid for the 2004 Summer Games, which ended with a 
bitter defeat to Athens in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time the bid cities arrived in Seoul early last week, the  
general feeling was that Sion was still the firm favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Italy's four IOC members -- Mario Pescante, Franco Carraro,  
Primo Nebiolo and Ottavio Cinquanta -- went to work. Pescante, in 
particular, lobbied furiously. 
</P>
<P>
	Sion was certain to be one of the finalists when a 16-member  
``selection college'' narrowed the six-city field to two just 
before the final vote. 
</P>
<P>
	For Italy, the key was making sure Turin was the other finalist.  
If Turin succeeded in making the final two, the Italians were 
convinced they had the votes to win in the general assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swiss wanted Helsinki as the second finalist, figuring Sion  
would easily win against the Finns. The Italians headed them off 
and managed to stack the selection panel with at least six Turin 
backers. 
</P>
<P>
	In the head-to-head final, Turin won by an amazing 17 votes.  
</P>
<P>
	Several other political subplots were at work throughout the  
process. 
</P>
<P>
	Jean-Claude Killy, the respected former Olympic ski champion and  
co-organizer of the 1992 Albertville Winter Games, came within one 
vote of failing to be elected to the selection panel. 
</P>
<P>
	With 16 members in the running, Killy tied with Argentina's  
Antonio Rodriguez for the eighth and final spot on the panel. 
Rodriguez withdrew to let Killy take the seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Some members apparently snubbed Killy, a Frenchman, because he  
lives in Switzerland and was seen as biased toward Sion. Killy said 
he was so offended he would have resigned from the IOC had he not 
made it onto the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2006 decision also was influenced by the race to succeed  
Juan Antonio Samaranch as IOC president, scheduled to step down in 
2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Sion's defeat was seen as a blow to the power bloc led by  
Canada's IOC vice president Dick Pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Turin's victory was a win for Pound's South Korean rival, Kim  
Un-yong. Despite receiving a severe warning for his role in the 
Salt Lake scandal, Kim has made clear he intends to be in the 
presidential running. 
</P>
<P>
	``The election in 2001 is very close,'' Christillin said. ``A  
bloc of votes circulated around that. For us, it was an advantage 
that the meeting was held in Seoul (Kim's hometown).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli IOC member Alex Gilady said the Seoul meetings provided  
a turning point in the organization's recovery process. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the first time since December that we felt we are doing  
something good,'' he said. ``For the first time, we were not 
discussing crisis and disaster. This makes the IOC stronger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch considers the crisis all but over.  
</P>
<P>
	``At the beginning of the year, we had rough seas,'' he said.  
``Now it's like a calm lake.''

<HEADLINE> Williams' Role in Murders Debated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The once-secluded ravine where two black boys  
were found dead 20 years ago this summer is now surrounded by 
upscale homes. And playmates of those boys now have young children 
of their own. 
</P>
<P>
	The boys -- 14-year-old Edward Hope Smith and 13-year-old Alfred  
Evans -- were the first of 29 slain young blacks who collectively 
became known across the nation as Atlanta's missing and murdered 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1982 conviction of Wayne B. Williams in the slayings of two  
adults, and authorities' decision to blame him for 22 of the other 
murders without trials, ended the official investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	And for many people, the memory of the murders has faded.  
</P>
<P>
	But nagging questions about how the investigation was handled,  
the release of voluminous police files and interminable court 
appeals have kept alive debate over Williams' guilt. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, now 41, continues to proclaim his innocence while  
serving life in prison. And with his latest appeal filed with the 
Georgia Supreme Court -- no hearing date is set -- his supporters now 
include relatives of some of the slain children, former 
investigators in the case and a retired state Supreme Court 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people who are aware of the child murders believe as I do  
that Wayne Williams did not commit these crimes,'' said DeKalb 
County Sheriff Sidney Dorsey, who, as an Atlanta homicide 
detective, supervised the first search of Williams' home in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorsey first voiced public doubt about Williams' guilt more than  
a decade ago, citing the 1980 case of 13-year-old Clifford Jones. 
Police files list five witnesses, including one who claimed to have 
seen Clifford strangled by a man who was not Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	That man, now deceased, appeared at the time to be a prime  
suspect in the slayings, said Joe Drolet, who helped prosecute 
Williams. But Drolet said the eyewitness proved unreliable and key 
parts of his story were contradicted by physical evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Willie Mae Mathis, whose 11-year-old son, Jefferey, was killed  
in 1980, said she changed her mind about Williams after Jefferey's 
brother met the convicted killer in prison and became convinced of 
his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wayne is guilty of being nothing but stupid,'' said Mrs.  
Mathis, who is organizing other victims' relatives to push for a 
reopening of the investigation of the child murders. 
</P>
<P>
	The pending appeal is based on a judge's rejection of Williams'  
latest effort to gain a new trial. Williams claims that prosecutors 
withheld key evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say that the judge's rejection, and the record of  
Williams' trial, clearly establish his guilt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wayne's trying to outlast all of us and he probably will,''  
said Jack Mallard, another prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	No witnesses saw Williams kill or abduct anyone.  
</P>
<P>
	The main prosecution evidence was tiny fibers found on the  
bodies and matched to rugs and other fabrics in the home and cars 
of Williams' parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecution witnesses also testified that two blood stains found  
in cars Williams used were consistent with the blood types of the 
only two victims who were stabbed. Williams and his lawyers are 
pressing for DNA tests to determine if the blood really came from 
the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you want to prove that Wayne Williams did this  
conclusively, let's get the DNA tests,'' Williams said in a recent 
interview at Valdosta State Prison. ``But if the DNA tests say that 
this is not their blood, we need to go back into court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' supporters contend that he was merely a convenient  
scapegoat for authorities who were under intense pressure to solve 
the child murders. 
</P>
<P>
	Police staking out a bridge over the Chattahoochee River, where  
some of the victims' bodies had been found, heard a splash early on 
the morning of May 21, 1981, and stopped Williams as he drove away. 
Two days later, the body of Nathaniel Cater, 27, was found 
downstream. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wayne Williams never did explain his presence on that bridge  
in the middle of the night,'' Drolet said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams was put under surveillance, his house was searched, and  
a month later he was arrested and charged with Cater's murder. He 
later also was indicted in the death of Jimmy Ray Payne, 21, whose 
body was one of those found in the river earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate over Williams also turns on the question of whether  
the killings really stopped with his arrest, or if similar killings 
continued largely unnoticed by police and the media. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are about 42 cases that, had I not been arrested, would  
have been part of this list,'' Williams insists. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis Slaton, who retired as district attorney three years ago,  
acknowledged that other young blacks were killed in the area after 
Williams' arrest. But he said investigators never found fibers on 
any of those bodies that were similar to the ones used to link 
Williams to the 24 slayings. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a powerful argument to me,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Gov. Mulls L.A. NFL Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Gov. Gray Davis reportedly is taking a strong  
role in negotiations to bring an NFL team to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, Davis has spoken with prospective owners and  
NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue, and appointed a personal 
representative, Bill Chadwick, to represent the state in 
negotiations, the Los Angeles Times reported Sunday. The newspaper 
cited negotiation insiders it did not identify. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has become abundantly clear to the governor that there is  
promise for this deal,'' said one person who has spoken with Davis. 
``He wants to make this happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The role that the governor's office is playing is that of  
trying to make sure the state's interests are represented and 
protected,'' city councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas said. ``And of 
making sure that the deal goes down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, that doesn't mean Davis wants California taxpayers to  
foot any of the bill, an aide indicated. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the NFL wants to come to Los Angeles, that would be  
great,'' said Michael Bustamante, the governor's chief spokesman. 
``But the governor is not interested in spending any state money on 
this deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two development groups, one led by billionaire Eli Broad and the  
other by Hollywood dealmaker Michael Ovitz, are vying to bring an 
NFL team to the Los Angeles Coliseum. They have separate proposals 
to modernize the stadium, but the Ovitz plan could require more 
than $200 million in public financing. 
</P>
<P>
	The state has a say in the issue because it owns Exposition  
Park, which surrounds the Coliseum. Some of that land could be used 
for stadium parking. 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue was expected to come to Los Angeles this week as the  
NFL continues to look into the competing Coliseum plans. The league 
has set a Sept. 15 deadline for a workable plan in Los Angeles, and 
intends to bring all 31 owners together in Chicago on July 28 for a 
Los Angeles status report.

<HEADLINE> Mickelson One Shot Short at US Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- In a matters of weeks -- or maybe even  
days -- a precious little girl will enter the world, open her eyes 
for the first time and glance up at her father with a look of 
unconditional love. 
</P>
<P>
	The anticipation of that moment makes it easier for Phil  
Mickelson to deal with the disappointment of losing the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Ready to leave at the sound of a beeper, Mickelson was able to  
hang around until Father's Day at Pinehurst No. 2 with his wife, 
Amy, back at home in Scottsdale, Ariz., awaiting the birth of their 
first child. 
</P>
<P>
	The daddy-to-be held a one-stroke lead over Payne Stewart with  
just three holes remaining Sunday, only to surrender the advantage 
with his only bogey of the round. Mickelson then watched helplessly 
as Stewart made a birdie at 17, then rolled in a 20-footer for par 
at the final hole to clinch his second U.S. Open championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a disappointing day,'' Mickelson said. ``But in the  
next couple of days we're expecting our first child, so that evens 
it out. I'm pretty excited about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 29-year-old Mickelson is so excited about the life-changing  
event that he vowed to drop his clubs and return home as soon as 
his wife went into labor -- even if he had a chance to win his first 
major title. 
</P>
<P>
	Amy Mickelson isn't scheduled to deliver until June 30, but a  
few rocky moments early in the pregnancy made the expectant father 
a little skittish about being several thousand miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not worth the tournament,'' Mickelson said earlier in the  
Open. ``As important as the U.S. Open is to me and every other 
player in the field, this is the birth of my first child.''

<HEADLINE> IOC Approves New Rule on Gifts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- International Olympic Committee  
members may accept gifts only of ``nominal value'' under new rules 
adopted Sunday because of the Salt Lake City scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	On the final day of its four-day session in Seoul, the general  
assembly approved a code of ethics drawn up by the new IOC ethics 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel, consisting of three IOC members and five outside  
members, formulated rules of conduct for IOC delegates and other 
Olympic officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission was formed in May as a result of the Salt Lake  
scandal, in which 10 IOC members were removed for accepting more 
than $1 million in improper inducements during Salt Lake's winning 
bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The new code does away with the previous $200 gift limit, a rule  
that has been widely ignored. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only gifts of nominal value, in accordance with prevailing  
local custom, may be given or accepted by the Olympic parties, as a 
mark of respect or friendship,'' the new rule says. ``Any other 
gift must be passed on to the organization of which the beneficiary 
is a member.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other provisions of the ethics code:  
</P>
<P>
	--Olympic delegates can not ``solicit, accept or offer any  
concealed remuneration, commission, benefit or service of any 
nature connected with the organization of the Olympic Games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Hospitality offered to members and companions ``shall not  
exceed the standards prevailing in the host country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Olympic officials must avoid any conflict of interest and  
``must not act in a manner likely to bring the reputation of the 
Olympic movement into disrepute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Bid cities ``shall refrain from approaching another party, or a  
third authority, with a view to obtaining any financial or 
political support'' inconsistent with the IOC manual. 
</P>
<P>
	The assembly also heard a preliminary report from the new IOC  
2000 reform commission, also created as a result of the Salt Lake 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The 80-member panel, which met for the first time two weeks ago,  
is studying structural changes in the IOC and reforms in the 
bidding and selection process. 
</P>
<P>
	No concrete proposals were put forward Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	The commission's three working groups will meet throughout the  
summer and submit final recommendations at the end of October. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC plans to hold a special session in December to ratify  
the reforms.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Trade Surplus Falls in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's trade surplus with the world dropped in May  
for the second month in a row, but its surplus with the United 
States remained on the rise, the government reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's merchandise trade surplus, the measure of all goods  
exported by a nation minus those imported, plunged 31.5 percent 
compared to the same month a year ago, the Finance Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	The May surplus -- $6.95 billion -- was lower than the average  
forecast of $7.90 billion by Tokyo-based economists surveyed by Dow 
Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, the surplus decreased 14.6 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	Japan's politically sensitive trade surplus with the United  
States, however, rose in May, increasing 14.9 percent to $4.35 
billion, the ministry said. The surplus rose 2.1 percent in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan, fighting its worst recession in 50 years, has been under  
heavy pressure from the United States and other trading partners to 
rein in the surplus by bolstering its weak economy to spark demand 
for imports. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministry said the recent falls in the overall surplus  
indicate that the trade surplus is on a gradual declining track. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first five months of this year, the surplus averaged a  
fall of 8.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline was mainly because exports fell at a faster pace  
than imports. Overall, exports were weighed down by falls in steel, 
computer parts, cars, and ships, a ministry official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's politically sensitive exports of steel to the United  
States continued falling since last December, down 56.9 percent at 
$125.7 million in May. Imports from the United States fell largely 
because of declining aircraft imports, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall imports slipped only 3.3 percent because of a 6.5  
percent increase in crude oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministry said May was the first time that Japan's trade  
surplus had fallen two months in a row since January 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's trade surplus had consistently grown more than 20  
percent for a string of months until last October. After that trend 
was broken by a 16.2 percent drop in November, the surplus 
alternated back and forth between falls and rises until the last 
two months. 
</P>
<P>
	In fiscal 1998, Japan's overall trade surplus rose 23 percent  
from the previous year to reach the second highest total ever 
recorded. 
</P>
<P>
	The 31.5 percent decline in the surplus in May was the largest  
since August 1996, when it plummeted 35.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar averaged 120.15 yen in May, down from 132.29 yen a  
year earlier.

<HEADLINE> Emergency Care for Pets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- An emergency medical technician guides a  
patient to a scale and shouts, 
``Two-thousand-one-hundred-and-thirty-five pounds!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Part hospital, part barn, the large animal clinic of Ohio State  
University Veterinary Hospital is a place where everything's bigger 
-- the needles, the gurneys, the medical challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	For horses, cows, bulls, goats, llamas and alpacas, the clinic  
is the 24-hour ER for pets and farm animals. 
</P>
<P>
	Brought in during the middle of the night for surgery, the  
patient that tipped the scales at more than a ton is a muscular 
brown horse with a blocked small colon. 
</P>
<P>
	Hope Hedrick, an equine technician in the clinic's intensive  
care unit, says the horse, muzzled and hooked up to IVs and 
monitors, will survive, but she has seen too many others that 
haven't. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the worst part of this job,'' she says. ``When there's  
nothing more you can do and you have to deal with the owner's 
emotions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 20,000 patients a year pass through the emergency room,  
which is the clinical teaching center for Ohio State's veterinary 
college -- one of 31 in the nation and the only one in Ohio, said 
hospital administrator Dr. Richard Bednarski. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the emergency cases involve the everyday accidents that  
happen to pets -- being hit by a car or ingesting toxins like rat 
poison. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Debra Bishop recalls a dog which lapped up its owner's  
insulin -- 4,000 units. It had to be monitored closely for days. 
</P>
<P>
	In the ICU, cages filled with sedated animals line the walls. In  
one, a tiny white poodle is hooked up to tubes and monitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has esophageal disease,'' Bishop says as she scans the  
monitors. ``He's getting a blood transfusion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the patients are here for secondary care. They've been  
seen by local veterinarians who referred them for the specialized 
treatment offered by the hospital. The small animal clinic is open 
until midnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The tough cases help educate the students.  
</P>
<P>
	A white mixed-breed dog named Lucy lies on the floor next to an  
exam table. She breathes heavily and coughs frequently. Her stomach 
is swollen with liquid. 
</P>
<P>
	Students in blue scrubs stoop to lift the 13-year-old dog to the  
table. Bishop stops them with a shake of her head and does the exam 
on the floor. Lucy's tail wags weakly as Bishop kneels on the 
linoleum beside her. 
</P>
<P>
	Bishop feels Lucy's stomach and listens to her breathing. A  
student in a white lab coat crouches beside the doctor, stroking 
Lucy. 
</P>
<P>
	Bishop is as focused on the students as she is on the animal.  
``What do you think we should do about this patient?'' Bishop asks. 
</P>
<P>
	Chest X-rays, they answer.  
</P>
<P>
	Bishop nods approval and stands as another dog enters the room.  
Corky was hit by a car last week and is having problems walking. A 
lab technician clips X-rays to a screen and the students gather 
around Bishop as she examines the films. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you see anything?'' she asks.  
</P>
<P>
	The students study it silently. ``Is that a fracture?''  
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton Leads N.Y. Senate Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Most New York voters don't care that Hillary  
Clinton has never lived here and don't believe her role as first 
lady would create a conflict with her potential Senate campaign, 
according to a Daily News poll released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll gave Mrs. Clinton a slight lead in a hypothetical  
Senate race with New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. The first 
lady led the mayor 47 to 39 percent, but the poll had a margin of 
error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the mayor and Mrs. Clinton are likely candidates for the  
seat being vacated by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y. The 
election is 16 months away. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll, conducted by Blum &AMP; Weprin Associates, also found that  
nearly three-fourths of voters do not feel it is a conflict for 
Mrs. Clinton to run for Senate while still serving as first lady. 
</P>
<P>
	More than two-thirds said Mrs. Clinton's lack of state residency  
would not keep them from voting for her. 
</P>
<P>
	The random survey of 805 registered voters around the state was  
conducted last week.

<HEADLINE> Belarus Triple Jumper Bolts Stadium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANNHEIM, Germany (AP) -- Natalya Kostitchenko, a Belarus triple  
jumper, ran away after winning her event in a junior track meet on 
Sunday rather than submit to doping control. 
</P>
<P>
	Kostitchenko won her event in the German Track &AMP; Field  
Federation Junior Gala in 44 feet, 6 inches, then fled after being 
informed she was one of six athletes chosen for doping control. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Mannheimer Morgen newspaper, Kostitchenko's  
first attempt to run away ended when she was caught by stadium 
helpers at a nearby canal. 
</P>
<P>
	She was then pulled into the control room, where two Belarus  
coaches allegedly offered ``dollars or marks'' to stop the German 
doctor from testing her. 
</P>
<P>
	One of her aides then yanked the junior jumper away from the  
German officials and they ran out of the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Kostitchenko, who still hadn't been found by the time the  
evening banquet for athletes took place, faces a two-year 
suspension for refusing testing.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Ships went on alert Sunday as the first  
hurricane of the eastern north Pacific this season generated high 
waves and heavy rainfall along Mexico's central coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Adrian was centered about 345 miles south of the tip  
of the Baja California Peninsula and moving to the west-northwest 
at 14 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Hurricane Center in Miami reported maximum  
sustained winds of 85 mph. Late Saturday, the storm had reached 
hurricane status when its wind speed surpassed 74 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities on the Baja California Peninsula were preparing to  
order residents to leave hillsides and river banks if necessary, 
the government news agency Notimex said.

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's president said Sunday that  
he will ignore a ruling banning him from campaigning for candidates 
for a new assembly that will rewrite the country's constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	``I declare that I'm campaigning now more than ever,'' Hugo  
Chavez said during his weekly radio program. ``If they want to put 
me in jail, well, go ahead and do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Venezuelan law prohibits Chavez and other high-level public  
officials from taking part in the campaign, which officially starts 
next Thursday, the National Electoral Council says. The election is 
July 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez, who took office in February, has called the council's  
ruling ridiculous. He has already been promoting candidates backed 
by his leftist Patriotic Pole coalition, which is expected to 
dominate the race. 
</P>
<P>
	His critics say he wants to use the assembly to concentrate  
power in his hands.

	MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- Nicaraguan bank regulators have  
ordered top officials of a Guatemalan-led bank detained for alleged 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicaragua's bank regulation agency said it has evidence that  
Banco del Sur made a series of fraudulent operations that were 
detected in the past few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Saturday it ordered the capture of bank president Mario  
Arnoldo Hernandez Colindres, the bank's manager and its auditor. It 
was unclear whether any of the men had been arrested Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez Colindres is a partner in a Guatemalan financial  
group, Financiera del Sur, which allegedly issued false investment 
certificates for the equivalent of $1 million to a Guatemalan woman 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicaraguan Superintendent of Banks Angel Navarro said  
investigators also found that Banco del Sur had no backing for 
between $10 million and $15 million registered in its holdings.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- President Fernando Henrique  
Cardoso's popularity has plunged to its lowest level, according to 
a poll released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll found 44 percent of Brazilians thought his government  
was ``bad'' or ``very bad,'' while only 16 percent described it as 
``good'' or ``very good,'' according to the polling group 
Datafolha. 
</P>
<P>
	The results put Cardoso's popularity at its lowest since he took  
office in 1995 and for the first time show that a majority believe 
he is doing a poor job, said the newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo, 
which also published the poll. 
</P>
<P>
	In past months, Cardoso's popularity has been hurt by economic  
austerity measures, record unemployment, and a scandal involving 
government favoritism over privatization of the state telephone 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll was based on interviews with 12,023 Brazilians between  
June 9 and 11. The margin of error is two percentage points.

	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- More than 40 percent of babies in  
Puerto Rico are born to unwed parents, a study by the University of 
Puerto Rico shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Results of the study, published Saturday in El Nuevo Dia  
newspaper, show 46 percent of the 64,214 births on the island in 
1997 were to unmarried parents, up from 43 percent in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	In 31 percent of the cases in 1995, the parents lived together.  
In the other 12 percent, the mother was the sole head of the 
household, researchers at the university's Medical Sciences Campus 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	The rate of births out of wedlock has risen steadily since 1975,  
when it stood at 18 percent. In 1980, the rate was 21 percent; in 
1985, 28 percent; and in 1990, 37 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers said of Puerto Rico's 78 municipalities,  
northeastern Moca had the lowest rate of unwed parents in 1995, 21 
percent. The highest, 62 percent, was in southern Santa Isabel. 
</P>
<P>
	They also noted that 69 percent of married couples had their  
babies in private hospitals, while most unwed mothers gave birth in 
public hospitals.

<HEADLINE> Jays' Wells Signs $11.5M Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- David Wells, the subject of trade rumors since  
Toronto acquired him from the New York Yankees at the start of 
spring training, agreed Sunday to an $11.5 million, one-year 
contract extension with the Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
	If an option for 2002 is exercised and Wells earns his  
performance bonuses, the new contract would be worth $20 million 
over two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	`I think right now he's the anchor of our rotation. If we're  
serious about being competitive, we're going to have to him pitch 
as well as he's capable of pitching,'' Blue Jays general manager 
Gord Ash said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland general manager John Hart has called Toronto several  
times to inquire about Wells. 
</P>
<P>
	``I take the approach that you always have to listen,'' Ash  
said. ``We've been doing a lot of listening ever since spring 
training about a number of our pitchers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if the extension makes Wells' better trade bait, Ash  
responded: ``That's certainly not the purpose of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wells pitched a four-hitter Sunday, striking out seven and  
walking none in a 2-1 win over Kansas City, his first complete game 
of the season. He lowered his ERA to 4.94. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells and the Yankees agreed in December 1997 to a $13.5  
million, three-year contract, a deal that pays him $4.5 million 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto decided Sunday to exercise a $4.5 million option for  
next year that carried a $1.5 million buyout. The new extension 
calls for a $2 million signing bonus, $8.25 million in 2001 and a 
$9 million option for 2002 with a $1.25 million buyout. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Wells can earn $750,000 in performance bonuses in  
2001: $250,000 each for 180, 200 and 220 innings.

<HEADLINE> Son Makes Ode to Father's Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- As a young man, Hy Meyerowitz was a vaudevillian,  
a sharp Catskills comedian who was the consummate toastmaster. 
</P>
<P>
	As an old man, his mind dulled by Alzheimer's disease,  
Meyerowitz still cracked one-liners, but they had lost their edge. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, three years before he died, his son Meyerowitz's son,  
photographer and filmmaker Joel Meyerowitz, decided to spring his 
father from an assisted-living facility in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., 
and take him and his own son on a road trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Prodding and probing the elderly man's imagination and memory,  
the three generations traveled back to New York City -- to Harlem, 
where the elder Meyerowitz spent his childhood, and to the Bronx, 
where he raised his family. 
</P>
<P>
	Casually sprawled in the back seat, drifting in and out of  
lucidity, Meyerowitz recalled snippets of the past. Like the time 
the family parakeet, Melvin Meyerowitz, flew away and was returned 
by a neighbor after he spoke the family's name. 
</P>
<P>
	Joel Meyerowitz and his son Sasha, 30, a cinematographer living  
in Boulder, Colo., filmed the trip with a camcorder. The result is 
``Pop,'' an hour-long ``Frontline'' documentary airing Tuesday at 9 
p.m. EDT on PBS. 
</P>
<P>
	The film is a montage of footage from the trip, and videos of  
Meyerowitz and his wife as young parents with three young sons. 
</P>
<P>
	Meyerowitz grew up during the vaudeville era. Quick-witted and  
spunky, his powers of observation made him the neighborhood sage. 
After marrying, he sold dry-cleaning supplies for a chemical 
company, but the entertainer in him never faded. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a dancer, he was a Chaplin mimic,'' Joel Meyerowitz  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He was also the neighborhood Solomon. ``I remember that people  
would gather in front of our window and they would yell ... And 
he'd come to the window and he'd adjudicate from the window.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His wit and sharp mind helped to mask his Alzheimer's symptoms  
for many years. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he started nailing $100 bills to the wall and hanging  
pictures on them and driving my mother to the supermarket and 
driving away, we started to realize, `Uh, oh, trouble,''' Joel 
Meyerowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
	While driving from Florida to New York, Joel tries to get his  
father to think rationally and to block out the obsessions forming 
in his mind: imagining his wife is cheating on him, or looking for 
coins on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the three-week trip, Joel tries to stimulate his  
father's mind with questions about his other sons and what they do 
for a living. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, Joel tries to get Hy to notice an absurd roadside  
sign, telling him he always enjoyed having his father point out 
unusual objects or situations to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``The things that were new to you were such funny things and  
such odd things. You always were showing (them) to me. And I know 
that's why I take pictures now -- because you pointed out all these 
things to me as a kid,'' Joel Meyerowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
	The film's producer and director, he is an acclaimed  
photographer who has authored 12 books, including ``Cape Light,'' 
scenic photos of Cape Cod and the Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	Having completed ``Pop,'' his first film, Joel Meyerowitz said  
his experiences may persuade him to explore care of the elderly in 
another film. 
</P>
<P>
	Hy Meyerowitz's wife of 65 years died at 86, several weeks after  
he returned to Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Joel Meyerowitz then moved his father to a nursing home in New  
York's East Village, just blocks from his own home. Hy died there 
in November at the age of 90. The day he died, ``Pop'' was being 
shown at the Museum of Modern Art in New York and at the Hampton 
Film Festival on Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Sasha Meyerowitz said the trip allowed him to discover new sides  
of his grandfather's personality. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really kind of fell in love with him on that trip. I think I  
was beginning to see his personality and his passion for life, his 
basic being,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He read people beautifully,'' Joel Meyerowitz said. ``He used  
humor as a lever. I guess that was the thrilling part for both my 
son and myself: to see someone with a disability and not yield to 
it.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise in Midday Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The U.S. dollar surged against the yen in morning  
trading Monday, boosted by talk that the Bank of Japan bought 
dollars to stem the Japanese currency's rise. Tokyo stocks 
advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.94 yen in early trading, up 2.62 yen from  
late Friday in Tokyo and also above its late Friday New York level 
of 120.44 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 281.95 points,  
or 1.62 percent, ending the morning session at 17,713.21. On 
Friday, the average fell 39.19 points, or 0.22 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, traders believed the Bank of Japan bought  
dollars and sold yen Monday morning, although it was not 
immediately known at which level the bank stepped in. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders believe the apparent intervention came shortly after the  
Finance Ministry announced that Japan's trade surplus shrank by a 
greater-then-expected 31.5 percent in May. 
</P>
<P>
	``If in fact the BOJ did intervene above the 120.00 yen level,  
it shows their resolve to push the dollar up even further,'' said 
Shuji Takano, assistant manager of foreign exchange at ABN AMRO 
Bank in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	If the intervention did occur, it would mark the fourth time in  
less than two weeks that Japan's central bank has done so. On 
Friday, at the BOJ's bequest, the European Central Bank bought 
euros for yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 126.80 yen, up from  
122.73 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices started higher as foreign investors  
continued to buy stocks on hopes that Japan's tenuous economic 
recovery may finally be picking up steam. 
</P>
<P>
	During a three-day meeting of the Group of Seven major nations,  
ended Sunday in Cologne, Germany, other participating leaders 
maintained pressure on Japan to do more to ensure it is on a 
domestic-led growth path. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said that the Japanese government  
will take every measure available to ensure stable growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 213 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.7400 percent from Friday's finish of 1.7300 percent, 
driving its price down to 97.10 yen from 97.18 yen.

<HEADLINE> Cole Criticizes Modern R&AMP;B Music </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- Natalie Cole, who cut her teeth on  
rhythm and blues, says modern R&AMP;B lacks soul. 
</P>
<P>
	``I mean lyrics and passion, some understanding of communicating  
an idea beyond just jumping into bed,'' the Grammy-winning daughter 
of the late Nat ``King'' Cole said in Sunday's edition of The 
Orange County Register. 
</P>
<P>
	``There used to be songs that I would listen to and have to go  
look up words in the dictionary afterward, you know? What happened 
to smart music like that?'' she said. ``I don't have to look up any 
of this stuff now -- and some of it I wouldn't want to look up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cole, whose first album in three years, ``Snowfall in the  
Sahara,'' is due in stores Tuesday, isn't too fond of rap, either. 
</P>
<P>
	She loved the work of the late Tupac Shakur, she said, but  
otherwise the angry posturing of rappers gets boring.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sets Goal For Wind Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States would be able to produce 5  
percent of the nation's energy from wind by the year 2020 under a 
new Energy Department plan, an agency official said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to try to double U.S. wind energy capacity by 2005  
and then double it again by 2010,'' said an Energy Department 
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``By 2020 it would 
be 5 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The level at 2010 would be 10,000 megawatts online, enough  
electricity to fulfill the annual needs of 3 million households, 
the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson will unveil the so-called Wind  
Powering America initiative Monday at the annual meeting of the 
American Wind Energy Association in Burlington, Vt. He also plans 
to announce $1.2 million in grants for wind turbine-testing 
projects in 10 states, but the states' identities weren't released. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think that wind technology has the most potential of any  
renewable energy technology right now,'' Richardson told The New 
York Times in a story for Sunday editions. Other leading renewable 
contenders are electricity from the sun or from sources like crop 
wastes. The Times reported that the federal government would try to 
reach 5 percent of its energy from wind by 2010, a decade ahead of 
the nation at large. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy officials said the department will invest money in  
research and development, encourage codes that are conducive to 
wind energy and encourage vocational schools to provide training in 
the necessary technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The DOE official said the department will work to establish new  
sources of income for farmers, rural landowners and American 
Indians by involving them in wind power projects. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost of wind power has decreased dramatically in the last  
two decades, according to DOE estimates. In 1980, capturing the 
wind as an energy source cost about 40 cents per kilowatt-hour, but 
now it costs about a nickel, the department official said.

<HEADLINE> Stewart Moves Toward U.S. Open Title  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- Instead of backing up to the field, Payne  
Stewart came out charging Sunday in the final round of the U.S. 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, who won the Open in 1991 and was a runner-up in '93 and  
'98, started the day with a one-shot lead in the light mist at 
Pinehurst No. 2. He quickly grabbed a two-shot margin over top 
contenders Phil Mickelson, Tiger Woods and David Duval with a 
15-foot birdie putt on the first hole. 
</P>
<P>
	After giving a shot back on the second hole when he missed the  
green right and his first pitch shot rolled back to his feet, 
Stewart stuck his approach shot on No. 3 within three feet for 
another birdie.

	Stewart, 42, lost a four-stroke lead to champion Lee Janzen in  
the final round of the Open last year at The Olympic Club. But he 
looked solid this time around as he made the turn at 2 under for 
the tourney. 
</P>
<P>
	The man known for his knickers found himself with at least a  
two-shot margin over everyone but Mickelson, his playing partner, 
who was within one shot after the soggy front nine. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods, looking for his first victory in a major since the '97  
Masters, got to even par for the tournament after making a 4-foot 
birdie on his first hole, but he flew his approach shot over the 
green at Nos. 3 and 5 and made bogeys. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval, the No. 1 player in the world, began with a par save from  
the woods on No. 1 and two birdies on his first three holes, but 
once again found trouble at his nemesis hole all week -- the par-3 
No. 6. He missed a 5-footer there for par that dropped him three 
shots behind Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval missed another 5-footer for par two holes later and his  
double-bogey on the par-3 ninth hole dropped one of this week's 
favorites from contention after a front-nine 2-over-par 37. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Mickelson couldn't put together anything early in his  
round, stringing together six straight pars, including a pair of 
par-saving 8-footers on the first two holes. He then sank a 25-foot 
birdie putt on No. 7 to pull closer to Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Herron, the lesser known of the leaders, lost his chance for  
a major title with a double-bogey on No. 6 and bogeys on the next 
two holes. He started the day two shots behind Stewart, who made a 
fabulous sand save for par on the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart's 1-under 34 on the front tied Mickelson and Vijay Singh  
for the best opening nine holes among Sunday's final three groups.

<HEADLINE> Cormorants Overrunning Great Lakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BASS ISLAND, N.Y. (AP) -- The battle is joined.  
</P>
<P>
	With the sun glaring hot overhead, the small skiff slides into  
shore. The island is already occupied. The attackers step out, 
quickly gathering their wits and weapons as they seek their 
targets. 
</P>
<P>
	The enemy puts up no resistance. They flee to a safe distance  
offshore to watch the destruction of their homes and the death of 
their young. 
</P>
<P>
	New York state wildlife biologist Jim Farquhar repeatedly stabs  
a 30-foot-long metal pole into peeling and waste-washed trees to 
dislodge 2- and 3-foot wide nests from the branches. The 3-inch 
blue-green eggs fall to the ground; those not broken also will die, 
abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
	The effort to control the exploding population of cormorants on  
eastern Lake Ontario has become a war -- not to Farquhar and his 
assistant, but to the anglers, fishing guides and businesses whose 
leisure and livelihoods are linked to the fish in the lake. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a conflict that is under way in other Great Lakes states,  
as well as on fish farms in the South, as the voracious diving bird 
has become a destructive invasion force under federal government 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
	``Personally, I like cormorants. I think they're a pretty neat  
bird. They are adaptable. They have done well despite humans. I 
admire that,'' Farquhar said, setting sight on another nest high 
above the ground. It is one of 50 he will destroy this day to keep 
the birds from colonizing this 5-acre island. 
</P>
<P>
	In eastern Lake Ontario alone, cormorants consumed 87.5 million  
fish in 1998, including 1.3 million smallmouth bass, the lake's 
most popular sport fish, according to a New York state report. 
</P>
<P>
	Fishermen caught about 36,000 bass.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was either us or the birds,'' said Ron Ditch, who faces  
fines and six months home confinement for admitting in federal 
court that he helped eight other men, including his three sons, 
kill up to 2,000 cormorants last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody was going to do anything about it. We had to save  
ourselves,'' said Ditch, a longtime fishing guide. 
</P>
<P>
	Ditch blames the cormorants for devastating his 49-year-old  
charter business and forcing one of his sons to move to Florida to 
find work. Up and down the lake's eastern shoreline, the complaint 
is the same from tackle shops, restaurants, hotels and other 
businesses whose prosperity depends on how well the fish are 
biting. 
</P>
<P>
	Cormorants have been a federally protected species since 1918  
when they were included in the original Migratory Bird Treaty 
between the United States and Canada. Since then, Mexico, Japan and 
Russia have become parties to the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	While the birds' foes say the cormorants have outgrown their  
protected status, changing it would be an international issue, said 
Diane Pence, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service spokeswwoman in 
Hadley, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``Besides, if we took away their protected status, they would be  
severely persecuted again. We would never completely take away 
their protection,'' Pence said. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the federal agency is in the early stages of piecing  
together a regional control plan, while allowing states some 
interim steps. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, Farquhar and his colleagues are destroying nests on  
selected islands to keep the birds from establishing new colonies, 
and they are spraying eggs with oil to suffocate the embryos inside 
to cancel out this year's hatching season. 
</P>
<P>
	One of six species of cormorants, the black, double-crested  
cormorant is native to the Canadian Plains but has moved eastward 
and southward looking for new breeding areas. It prefers remote 
islands, away from humans and predators. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists counted 15,800 breeding pairs in 48 colonies in the  
U.S.-Canadian Great Lakes during a 1990 census. In 1997, there were 
more than 85,300 breeding pairs in 159 colonies. Scientists 
estimate there are three to four single birds for every pair. 
Unchecked, the cormorant population is increasing by about 7 
percent a year, said John Trapp, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
biologist. 
</P>
<P>
	Distantly related to pelicans, cormorants first appeared on Lake  
Ontario in the late 1930s. Today, the Little Galloo Colony in 
eastern Lake Ontario is the largest cormorant nesting area in the 
Great Lakes with more than 7,000 pairs. It is there that the 
cormorant problem is at its worst. How much longer that will be 
true is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see them everywhere,'' said Malcolm Both, secretary for the  
Great Lakes Sport Fishing Council, an umbrella organization for 90 
local and regional associations. 
</P>
<P>
	``So far, the impact has been on small areas. But there's a  
significant concern that soon others will be experiencing problems 
like New York,'' said Both, of Racine, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, on northern Lake Michigan, commercial fishermen  
complain of finding cormorants entangled in their underwater nets. 
On Lake Erie, the birds are blamed for a decline in the perch and 
walleye fisheries. 
</P>
<P>
	The once-verdant Little Galloo, a 55-acre island located five  
miles offshore in Lake Ontario, looks like a lunar landscape. The 
cormorants have stripped it of its flora for their nests. A blanket 
of guana coats the ground and has poisoned the trees. The other 
birds that once roosted here -- including rare black-crowned night 
herons -- have left. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, animal-rights groups, whose attention was galvanized  
by last summer's slaughter, monitor the predicament, ready to 
intervene on behalf of the birds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not convinced the population of cormorants needs to be  
reduced just because they are competing with some sports anglers 
who want trophy smallmouth bass,'' said Michael Markarian, 
executive director of Fund for Animals, a New York City-based 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cormorants are doing what they need to do to survive, and  
that's eat fish,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Some interim steps allowed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  
to control cormorants: 
</P>
<P>
	-- In Vermont, state officials are using small-scale fireworks to  
harass cormorants into abandoning their nests on Bixby Island in 
Lake Champlain. The cormorants are blamed for defoliating the 
island and driving off other birds. Cormorants first came to Lake 
Champlain in 1972; today, there are 3,000 nesting pairs on a 
handful of islands in the lake. 
</P>
<P>
	-- In Arkansas and 12 other states, fish farmers can obtain  
federal permits to shoot pilfering cormorants, which find easy 
pickings at the farm ponds. The federal government considers the 
farm fish personal property and allows the farmers to take steps to 
protect it. The other states are Alabama, Florida, Georgia, 
Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, North Carolina, 
Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	-- In Orleans, Mass., residents want permission to shoot  
migrating cormorants, which roost in their Cape Cod seaside village 
on the way to their winter home in the Louisiana wetlands. There 
are so many birds, residents complained, that they cannot hang out 
clothes to dry or sit outside to eat because of all the bird 
droppings. 
</P>
<P>
	The first cormorant control efforts date back to 1944-1952 when  
Maine was allowed to spray oil on more than 200,000 cormorant eggs 
to reduce its coastal colonies. The oil suffocates the eggs' 
embryos. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Some facts about cormorants:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The double-crested cormorant is a glossy black goose-sized  
bird with webbed feet. Its bill is hooked at the tip and it has an 
orange pouch underneath. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The cormorant's feathers lack oil for waterproofing, which  
enables it to swim underwater, propelled by its webbed feet. 
Because its feathers get wet, cormorants are frequently seen 
sunning on rocks with their wings outspread. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Cormorants can dive up to 40 feet underwater. Chinese  
fishermen use them as a tool to help catch fish. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Cormorants spend about 60 minutes a day fishing. An average  
cormorant will capture about five fish an hour. Their feeding range 
is about 25 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Cormorants are opportunistic feeders; they eat the most  
readily available species. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Cormorants live an average of 15 years.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Female cormorants usually lay three to four eggs per clutch,  
but can lay as many as seven. They fledge two to three chicks per 
clutch. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Their nests are made of twigs and whatever flotsam or debris  
they can find. They are 2- to 3-feet wide. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The North America double-crested cormorant population is  
estimated at between 1 million and 2 million. About 70 percent are 
still located in their native territory, the prairie lakes of 
Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan. About 12 percent are located in 
the Great Lakes. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The double-crested cormorant has been found breeding now in 40  
states, all 10 Canadian provinces, Mexico, Cuba and the Bahamas.

<HEADLINE>  Avery Johnson Knows About Traveling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As many places as he's been and as many times as  
he's had to move, Avery Johnson plays basketball with a basic sense 
of insecurity. 
</P>
<P>
	He's not a franchise player like Tim Duncan or David Robinson,  
each a 7-footer, each able to dominate games with brute strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he's a journeyman point guard two wins from an NBA  
championship. Johnson is coach Gregg Popovich's on-court presence 
for the San Antonio Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always feel I'm one step from being cut,'' Johnson said  
Sunday. ``Pop might wake up one day and say, `We don't want you 
anymore.' That keeps you humble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And that's a permanent state of mind for the guy with the  
high-pitched voice who's been playing the point in the NBA for 11 
years after not even being drafted out of college. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the third time Johnson's NBA odyssey has passed through  
San Antonio. The other stops were in Seattle, where he signed 
originally as an undrafted free agent in 1988, Denver, Houston and 
Golden State. He even spent time in the U.S. Basketball League with 
the long-forgotten Palm Beach Stingrays. 
</P>
<P>
	He once was traded by Seattle for a second-round draft pick in a  
league where only the first-round picks usually mean anything. And 
the SuperSonics had to wait seven years to collect the draft 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
	He's been waived twice and signed as a free agent seven times.  
He has, as they say, been around the block. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some guys get older and worse,'' he said. ``I got older and  
better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a cerebral player in a lot of ways. The game is mental for  
me, not physical anymore. I'm not a 150-pound guy out of Southern 
University anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way to measure how good I am is by wins.''  
</P>
<P>
	And the Spurs won more games than anybody else in the league  
this season, with Johnson averaging 9.7 points and 7.4 assists and 
keeping the big guys underneath happy. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Tim and Dave, I'm always mindful of their shot  
attempts,'' he said. ``If I have to force the issue, I'll pass up 
the shot to get them the ball. You've got to keep Dave involved or 
he tends to float a little.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If that sounds a little critical, it's not unusual. Johnson  
speaks his mind and on his mind is how the Spurs, flirting with all 
kinds of playoff records for wins, are playing right now. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our offense has not been good,'' he said, shaking his head.  
``Our spacing, our passing. We're passing when we shouldn't be and 
not passing when we should. We're not close to being good 
offensively.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson has played well, with 14 points and 13 assists in the  
first two wins. He thinks he can turn his game up even further. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I don't have control and we make too many empty passes  
and shot clock violations, that's bad,'' he said. ``We've got to do 
a better job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And yet, they continue to win.  
</P>
<P>
	Johnson is 34 and brings maturity to a lineup where 23-year-old  
Tim Duncan has become the main man. AJ watches Duncan's approach to 
the postseason with some interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tim is excited,'' he said. ``But our appreciation level is  
different because our frame of reference is different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan, remember, was a lottery player, the No. 1 pick in the  
draft. He didn't have to go shopping for a team. And he'll never be 
traded for a second-round pick. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Palm Beach Stingrays?  
</P>
<P>
	No chance.

<HEADLINE> Graf Finds Happiness in Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Steffi Graf just turned 30, but she  
seems to be turning back time. 
</P>
<P>
	On the eve of Wimbledon a year ago, her WTA Tour ranking had  
plunged to 91, the result of an injury layoff and knee surgery that 
caused her to miss four Grand Slams. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Graf is fresh from winning the French Open -- her 22nd major  
singles title -- and there's again talk of her tying Margaret 
Court's record of 24. There's also talk this may be her last 
Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
	She's won here seven times, twice beating Martina Navratilova  
and Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario in the finals as well as Monica Seles, 
Gabriela Sabatini and Jana Novotna. This year she's seeded No. 2 
behind Martina Hingis, conjuring thoughts of a rematch of French 
Open finalists. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the beginning of the year,'' she said, ``things didn't go  
so well. But in the last two week I've rediscovered the pleasure of 
tennis. I feel more open now, more able to express my feeling 
without the fear of losing my concentration. I've got rid of the 
burden of records. ... Maybe that's why I've started winning 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graf said her announcement to never return to the French Open  
was spontaneous, knowing it would be impossible to top her dramatic 
win over Hingis. Would a Wimbledon victory bring a similar 
announcement? 
</P>
<P>
	``You never know, it could be my last one,'' said Graf, who is  
two short of Navratilova's record of nine Wimbledon singles titles. 
``But I'm not thinking about that right now. I don't want to talk 
about something that may never happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *UNEASY NOVOTNA:* This is a different Wimbledon for Jana Novotna  
-- and it won't be an easy one. 
</P>
<P>
	She's the defending champion with hardly anyone picking the  
widely experienced grass-court player to repeat, partially because 
of a severe ankle injury sustained playing doubles with Natasha 
Zvereva at the French Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``We crashed into one another and I stepped on Natasha's foot  
and turned my ankle,'' she said. ``This is the worst sprain I've 
had in years. I was carried off the court I was in a lot of pain 
for a few days. I'm extra pleased with the progress I've made. When 
this happened I thought Wimbledon was probably over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Novotna has had a difficult summer and a poor clay-court season.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a struggle and I have to be ready to fight,''  
she said. ``I don't want to look too far. My goal after my sprain 
was to play at Wimbledon. That was my biggest goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Always a robust looking player, Novotna has been surpassed by a  
younger generation. ``Women's tennis is becoming just a power game 
-- very simple, strong and physical,'' she said, noting the lack of 
serve and volley players. ``It's not about variety or thinking 
game. It's just becoming pure power. Whoever hits harder is the 
winner.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	BECKER'S BACK:@ Three-time champion Boris Becker is back after  
saying two years ago he'd played his last Wimbledon. Now the 
31-year-old German says this will be his last one. 
</P>
<P>
	He faces Scot Miles Maclagan in a winnable first-round match and  
then is likely to face fellow German Nicolas Kiefer. If he survives 
until the fourth round, look for him U.S. Open champion Pat Rafter 
to give him his final good-bye. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	DRUG TESTS:@ Widely criticized for being too lax on drug  
testing, the International Tennis Federation says it will carry out 
15-20 random test daily at Wimbledon -- and test every loser from 
the quarterfinal stage. 
</P>
<P>
	ITF spokesman Alun James said the number was slightly up from a  
year ago when former Australian Open champion Petr Korda became the 
first player to test positive at Wimbledon. Korda, who is in a 
legal battle with the ITF over the test, announced his retirement 
last week after failing to qualify for Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PICK ME:* Looking for a Wimbledon winner? Goran Ivanisevic,  
three times a Wimbledon runner-up and loser in a five-set final a 
year ago to Pete Sampras, is picking himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm feeling good and I'm not the favorite. I find I always  
play better without that added pressure. I will certainly bet on 
myself to win at Wimbledon, it's the one tournament that I would 
love to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Is a third rematch in the final with Sampras possible?  
</P>
<P>
	``Sampras loves Wimbledon and the whole place is like his  
home,'' Ivanisevic said. ``Grass suits his game, and to beat him in 
the final would be the ultimate achievement.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *THE ODDS:* Sampras is 11-8 to win his sixth Wimbledon,  
according to British bookmakers William Hill. He is followed by Tim 
Henman 7-1, Richard Krajicek 8-1, Pat Rafter 9-1, Greg Rusedski 
14-1, Andre Agassi and Ivanisevic 16-1, Mark Philippoussis 20-1 and 
Karol Kucera 25-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis tops the women at 6-4 followed by Graf 3-1, Venus  
Williams 5-1, Lindsay Davenport and Monica Seles 12-1, Novotna 
16-1, Anna Kournikova 33-1, Nathalie Tauziat 40-1 and Arantxa 
Sanchez-Vicario 50-1. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *RAIN, OF COURSE:* The last three Wimbledons have been battered  
by record rain. This one should be better, but with a wet start. 
Monday should be nearly shower-free, with Tuesday bringing light 
showers and Wednesday calling for a chance of heavy rain. That 
should give way to clear skies though Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``And for the second week the outlook is reasonable, quite good  
with a light risk of showers,'' said forecaster Andrew Honeyman of 
the British Met Office. ``It has to be better than recent years.''

<HEADLINE> Radio Host Clifton Fadiman Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANIBEL ISLAND, Fla. (AP) -- Clifton Fadiman, a writer, book  
editor, radio and television entertainer who was host of the 
popular radio show ``Information Please'' in the 1930s, died 
Sunday. He was 95. 
</P>
<P>
	Fadiman, who died at his son's home, was diagnosed with terminal  
pancreatic cancer last October, said his wife, Annalee Whitmore 
Fadiman. The two lived on Captiva Island, Fla., off Florida's Gulf 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Fadiman most recently served as general editor on several  
publications, including ``World Poetry'' and the fourth edition of 
one of his own works, ``The Lifetime Reading Plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He penned more than 65 introductions to a wide range of editions  
including ``War and Peace,'' ``The Martian Chronicles'' and ``Six 
by Seuss.'' He was awarded the National Book Award for 
Distinguished Contribution to American Letters in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a quick, entertaining mind and was never boring for a  
second,'' Mrs. Fadiman said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1985, he was honored as an editor for ``A World Treasury of  
Children's Literature,'' Britannica Junior Encyclopedia, the Young 
Children's Encyclopedia and other works, winning the Dorothy C. 
McKenzie Award for contribution to children's literature. 
</P>
<P>
	But for many who knew him, Fadiman probably will be best  
remembered for his mostly anonymous role as senior judge for the 
Book-of-the-Month Club. It's a relationship he fostered for more 
than half a century, starting in the early '40s. Despite losing his 
sight, he continued to make selections, listening to audio versions 
well into his 90s. 
</P>
<P>
	Fadiman referred to a quotation he attributed to Aldous Huxley,  
who expressed concerns about science destroying human and political 
values in his 1932 satirical novel ``Brave New World,'' as a theme 
in his own life. ``Let's be a little kinder to each other,'' 
Fadiman said during an interview in March 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of New York, Fadiman began his career -- a term he  
reserved for sports figures -- in 1925 as a teacher at Ethical 
Culture High School, better known as Fieldston. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years later, he switched professions, first becoming  
associate editor and then editor-in-chief at Simon &AMP; Schuster. 
During that time, Fadiman wrote articles and became Book Editor for 
The New Yorker, a position he held from 1933 to 1943. 
</P>
<P>
	Fadiman also tried his hand at radio, serving as master of  
ceremonies for the top-10 hit ``Information Please,'' which ran for 
a decade starting in 1938. The show consisted of a panel of experts 
who were quizzed by the audience. That was followed by the 
television program ``This is Show Business,'' and another stint on 
radio as the host of ``Conversation'' from 1954-57. 
</P>
<P>
	He became a member of the selection committee for the  
Book-of-the-Month Club in 1944, eventually taking on the titles of 
senior judge, chief editorial adviser and finally chairman emeritus 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Fadiman, whose two hobbies consisted of wine and ``the avoidance  
of exercise,'' had a simple lifelong work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't retire,'' he said. ``I wouldn't know what to do.''

<HEADLINE> 'Son of Sam' Killer Upset Over Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- David Berkowitz, the ``Son of Sam'' serial  
killer, says he is saddened by the upcoming release of Spike Lee's 
movie based on his 1977 murder spree. 
</P>
<P>
	``This madness, the ugliness of the past is resurfacing again --  
all because some people want to make some money,'' Berkowitz said 
in a prison interview with The New York Times published Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Following his arrest 22 years ago, the former postal clerk  
confessed to fatally shooting six people and wounding seven others. 
He later said he took orders from a black Labrador retriever named 
Sam that was owned by a neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
	Berkowitz, 46, said he is now a born-again Christian.  
</P>
<P>
	``I pray for Spike Lee and his family, his wife, Tonya, his two  
children, Jackson and Satchel,'' he said. ``God does not want me to 
be angry with anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Berkowitz, relatives of Berkowitz's victims also are  
upset about the movie, claiming it exploits the crimes for profit. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee responded only indirectly to the Times' request for comment,  
saying, ``I made a statement on that at the beginning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In May, at the Cannes film festival where ``Summer of Sam'' was  
premiered, Lee told reporters: ``I feel deeply for the parents of 
the victims of Son of Sam. At the same time, I'm an artist, and 
this is the story I wanted to tell. Even if I didn't make this 
film, that was not going to bring their daughters, their loved ones 
back. ... We do not feel that the film is a glorification of David 
Berkowitz.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Summer of Sam'' is scheduled to be released the first week of  
July.

<HEADLINE> Stewart Has Career Worth of Putts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- Payne Stewart had already made a career's  
worth of U.S. Open putts by the time he made the one his career 
will always be remembered by. 
</P>
<P>
	He did it all without looking, just like his wife told him to  
the night before. 
</P>
<P>
	``She told me `You've got to hold your head still,''' Stewart  
said. ``I never moved my head to watch a putt go in all day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A tip from his wife, Tracey, after the third round had Stewart  
out on the practice green late Saturday, putting with his eyes 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
	He peeked just once, in time to watch the putt drop to win his  
second Open title. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I looked up it was two feet from the hole and breaking  
right to the center,'' Stewart said. ``I couldn't believe it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The magical 15-footer in a light rain won Stewart his second  
Open title. But a lot of others had to drop earlier for it to even 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
	A 25-footer on 16 to save par kept Stewart in the tournament. A  
3-footer on the next hole put him ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	Without them, the Open championship wouldn't have been at stake  
when he lined up an uphill putt he read perfectly inside the left 
edge and struck just as well as the crowds ringing the 18th green 
went berserk. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe somebody will start giving me credit for being able to  
putt,'' said Stewart, who had only 24 putts in the final round. ``I 
made a lot of them today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A bunch might be more accurate.  
</P>
<P>
	Eighteen times Stewart pulled his putter out on the slick greens  
at Pinehurst. Twelve of those times, the ball found the bottom of 
the cup. 
</P>
<P>
	But none had the drama of the last stroke at Pinehurst.  
</P>
<P>
	``I said to myself, `You've always wanted a putt to win the U.S.  
Open,''' Stewart said. ``I can't describe the feeling in my body 
when I looked up and the ball was going in the hole. It was 
unbelievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the time the par putt to win dropped, Stewart had used only  
three swipes of the putter on the last three of Pinehurst No. 2's 
domed greens. 
</P>
<P>
	He hit only one of those greens in regulation, but managed to  
play them 1 under. 
</P>
<P>
	``The putts Payne made on 16 and 18 showed what a great champion  
he is,'' said Phil Mickelson, who could only watch with a bemused 
look on his face as his Open chances vanished. 
</P>
<P>
	With pins tucked on ledges and leaning precariously on the  
mounded edges of Pinehurst's greens, this seemed destined to be an 
Open won by the most creative golfer around the shaved surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
	That would have been Mickelson, who used an assortment of shots  
with his lob wedge to get up-and-down on four of the first six 
holes. Or perhaps Tiger Woods, who liked to pull his 3-wood out 
around the greens to chip the ball up close. 
</P>
<P>
	But it turned out the Open would be won by the player who putted  
the best, and that was Stewart in a landslide. 
</P>
<P>
	It was quite a difference from last year at Olympic Club, where  
Stewart missed putts coming down the stretch, including one on the 
18th that would have given him a tie with Lee Janzen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had something to prove to myself this time,'' Stewart said.  
``I had to get in position and I had to deal with it once I got 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson, who one-putted four of the first six holes for par,  
missed down the stretch when it counted the most. 
</P>
<P>
	He gave himself a chance, but when his 40-footer for birdie on  
15 hit the cup, seemed ready to drop, and then spun out, his luck 
seemingly ran out. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson missed a 7-footer for par on 16 that dropped him into  
a tie with Stewart, then missed a 7-footer for birdie on the next 
hole. Still, even when his 25-footer slid past the cup on 18 he was 
heading toward a Monday playoff if Stewart didn't make his. 
</P>
<P>
	``His putt was a little easier than mine,'' Mickelson said. ``It  
was uphill and he could be very aggressive with it. I thought he 
had a good chance at it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods, for one, was glad he made it, after missing a 5-footer of  
his own on 17 that cost him the tournament. If Woods had made that 
putt, and Stewart missed on 18, there would have been a three-way 
playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be able to sleep a little better tonight,'' Woods said.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Angered by Olympic Snub </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA -- Above a photograph of young women crying in the streets  
of Sion, on the front of a 20-page supplement that was supposed to 
be a victory souvenir issue, the newspaper Le Matin printed a 
one-word question: ``Why?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The weekly SonntagsBlick thought it had the answer in its  
front-page headline: ``It was revenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-four hours after their hopes of holding the 2006 Winter  
Olympics in Sion were dashed, the Swiss on Sunday were analyzing 
the defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	This was Sion's third time of bidding for the games. The IOC had  
given the bid top marks, and the support from government, business 
and the public was overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
	What's more, the Swiss believed their bid represented everything  
that was best about the Olympics. At a time when the IOC is trying 
to recover from its worst scandal, Sion presented itself as the 
``fair play games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Everything was in place. The celebrations even began the day  
before the announcement. In spite of the caution of the bid 
committee and the dire warnings about the actions of Marc Hodler, 
the Swiss IOC member who first spoke about Olympic corruption, few 
seriously doubted the result. 
</P>
<P>
	The parties came to an abrupt halt at 7:31 a.m. when IOC  
president Juan Antonio Samaranch announced: ``The hosts of the 2006 
Games will be Torino.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soon to follow were television pictures of the winning Italian  
city of Turin, where most people did not even know the bid was 
taking place and no one was celebrating. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are we bad losers?'' asked Le Matin, which is based in  
Lausanne, the headquarters of the International Olympic Committee 
since 1915. 
</P>
<P>
	``No. But the victory of a town which everyone agreed was  
inferior to Sion (except in terms of financial clout), the triumph 
of a candidate without popular support ... everything makes us 
wonder about the behind-the-scenes forces which control the IOC 
today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the IOC Museum in Lausanne, staff reported that people were  
coming in and asking them how they could work for such a corrupt 
organization. A statue was defaced with the word ``Mafia'' and 
police stepped up their presence in the face of possible 
demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
	All the Sunday newspapers in Switzerland agreed that at least  
part of the reason for Sion's loss was a backlash against Hodler. 
It was the 81-year-old lawyer and long-serving IOC member who 
revealed much of the corruption surrounding the IOC, leading to 
expulsions and resignations. 
</P>
<P>
	``They wanted to punish Switzerland, and they have done it,''  
Hodler said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the newspapers had no bitterness against him.  
</P>
<P>
	``Marc Hodler said what had to be said in the context of the IOC  
corruption scandal. ... Now Sion has to pay for that,'' 
SonntagsBlick wrote in an editorial. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swiss papers agreed on one other thing, too -- there should  
be no bid for 2010. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Olympics are perhaps not the ideal place for our  
proverbial honesty,'' Le Matin said.

<HEADLINE> Gunman Said To Have Heroin Habit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORRISTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- The former nurse accused of holding two  
women hostage for nearly three days in a hospital, then killing one 
and critically injuring another, had struggled with a heroin 
problem for more than 15 years, his family said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Czajkowski, 40, of Collegeville had kicked his drug habit  
for about seven years in the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he started up again in early 1998 after becoming  
addicted to painkillers he was taking for a kidney stone, said his 
brother, Mark Czajkowski. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, he recently had become delusional, paranoid and  
angry, especially after he was fired on April 16 from his nursing 
job at Norristown State Hospital, relatives said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was extreme indication that Dennis was mentally  
incapacitated about (being fired) and the family was not the only 
ones who knew this,'' said his sister-in-law, Tracy Czajkowski of 
Bensalem. 
</P>
<P>
	She did not say who else knew about it. She could not be reached  
for additional comment Sunday because there was no telephone 
listing for her in Bensalem. 
</P>
<P>
	State police have not said whether Czajkowski was under the  
influence of drugs during the standoff. They described him as being 
``even-keeled'' and ``coherent'' during negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Czajkowski was being held without bail Sunday. A preliminary  
hearing is set for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if Czajkowski is capable of murder, Tracy Czajkowski  
responded: ``Absolutely not. He's not a violent person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Mark Czajkowski said that while he feared his brother might  
kill himself, he never suspected he would hurt anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
	Czajkowski, an 11-year employee of Norristown State Hospital, is  
accused of bursting into the facility on Wednesday, firing several 
shots, and capturing Carol Sue Kepner, 54, of Wynnewood, and Maria 
G. Jordan, 37, of Norristown, both nursing supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday morning, police worried about the hostages' safety  
decided to break a window to get a better look at them. Czajkowski 
immediately opened fire, killing Ms. Kepner and wounding Ms. Jordan 
before he was subdued by state troopers.

<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Bettina Wiegmann, one of Germany's best  
players throughout the 1990s, scored on a penalty kick as the 
favored Germans salvaged a 1-1 tie Sunday with Italy in their World 
Cup opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing before a relatively quiet crowd of some 18,000 -- about  
one-fifth the capacity of the cavernous Rose Bowl -- Germany used a 
tactical offense that finally provided a goal in the 61st minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany, beaten by Norway in the 1995 world championship game  
and top-seeded in its group this time, fell behind in the first 
half. Then it barely missed on several good scoring opportunities 
early in the second, including a shot by Maren Meinert that hit the 
crossbar. 
</P>
<P>
	But Italian defender Roberta Stefanelli tackled Birgit Prinz  
hard in the box, missing the ball. Referee Elizabeth Abidoye of 
Nigeria whistled Stefanelli for the foul. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiegmann, a 28-year-old midfielder playing in her third World  
Cup, and who was Germany's leading scorer in the 1995 World Cup and 
1996 Olympics, beat goalkeeper Gioriga Brenzan by curling her 
penalty kick inside the right post. 
</P>
<P>
	A foul also led to Italy's goal, by Patrizia Panico in the 36th  
minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Panico, dribbling outside the box on the left, was fouled by  
Doris Fitschen, and the ball was spotted 3 yards outside the 
penalty area. 
</P>
<P>
	Anna Duo rolled the ball to Antonella Carter, and the  
32-year-old midfielder lifted a perfect cross to the far post. 
Panico, charging toward the goal with no defender on her, headed 
the ball just inside the near post to beat goalie Silke Rottenberg.

<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Tight play, sharp passing and superb  
goalkeeping led China to a 2-1 victory over Sweden on Saturday, the 
opening day of the Women's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Swedish midfielder Kristen Bengtsson, the oldest player on the  
team at 29, scored the first goal just two minutes into the game -- 
cracking a hard, high ball into the upper left corner of the net. 
</P>
<P>
	China's goalie, Gao Hong, got her hand on it but the ball slid  
in. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-fastest goal in Women's World Cup history -- Sweden  
scored in the first minute in 1991 against Japan -- was also 
Sweden's only goal of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen minutes later, China came back when Liu Ying knocked a  
sweeping corner kick across the front of Sweden's goal and Jin Yan 
headed it down into the corner, just past the fingertips of diving 
goalie Ulrika Karlsson. 
</P>
<P>
	China's decisive goal came in 68th minute when Liu Ailing kicked  
a low, fast shot into the middle of the net. Her goal, assisted by 
Liu Ying, came at the end of a string of seven passes all the way 
down the field by China. 
</P>
<P>
	Coordinated, neat play distinguished China, contrasting with  
Sweden's faster, more aggressive style. Gao, one of the top goalies 
in women's soccer, recovered after her initial miss to stop several 
tough shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweden beat China 1-0 in the 1991 World Cup quarterfinals. In  
the 1995 World Cup, China won 4-3 on penalty kicks in the 
quarterfinals.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumers are flocking to the Internet, where  
shopping by computer is convenient and easy, the selection 
seemingly unlimited and the sales tax uncollected. New research 
shows online sales rising 300 percent a year and possibly topping 
$200 billion in 2000.

	Keeping electronic commerce tax-free will help the economy grow  
faster, say many in business. But merchants large and small, on 
Main Street and in the mall, fear online shopping robs them of 
customers, while local governments worry about eroding the tax base 
needed for schools and public safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Everybody frets about losing business if high U.S. taxes are  
imposed on Internet purchases: Americans might buy from foreign 
companies while consumers in other countries might bypass U.S. 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	A 19-member commission created by Congress meets Monday in  
Williamsburg, Va., to begin sorting through tax options for 
Internet commerce. The goal is to have new laws in place before a 
federal moratorium on new taxes for e-commerce expires Oct. 21, 
2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel's incoming chairman, Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore, a  
Republican elected in 1997 on a tax-cutting platform, said in an 
interview he has no illusions about how difficult it will be to 
reach a consensus. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would not overestimate the conflict. It may not be  
resolvable,'' Gilmore said. ``My goal is to run the commission in a 
way that allows all ideas to be aired out and to give a fair 
hearing. We will not cook up a policy and try to ram it down 
somebody's throat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the growth of e-commerce, the commission's work promises to  
have a lasting effect on Americans' shopping habits. 
</P>
<P>
	Austan Goolsbee, an economics professor at the University of  
Chicago, said most research indicates online sales next year could 
reach $200 billion to $1 trillion. His own study of 25,000 online 
buyers concluded that imposing a sales tax on remote commerce would 
cut spending by 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Internet sales are highly sensitive to local taxation,''  
Goolsbee said. 
</P>
<P>
	In most states with a sales tax, people who buy things online or  
from out-of-state catalogue companies are supposed to calculate and 
send in the sales taxes, but it is rarely enforced. In 1992 the 
Supreme Court said Congress would have to change the law to require 
one state to collect and remit taxes for business done in another 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	Commission members include government officials and executives  
from telecommunications and Internet industry companies such as 
AT&AMP;T Corp., computer maker Gateway Inc., America Online and broker 
Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Gov. Gary Locke of Washington and Republican Gov.  
Michael Leavitt of Utah are among the political members. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the commission's first meeting, the lobbying has  
been intense. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizations representing mayors and counties used a federal  
lawsuit to block the commission from meeting until Senate Majority 
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., replaced Netscape chief James Barksdale 
with a local public official -- tipping the membership's balance 
toward government. 
</P>
<P>
	Those same groups, joined by governors and other local  
officials, said in a recent letter to commission members that its 
tax priorities should include ``equitable treatment for all Main 
Street sellers and preservation of the single most important 
resource for education in our nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our ability to raise, educate and train children ... will  
determine whether we can meet the needs of the nation's new 
information technology,'' their letter said. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, commission member Grover Norquist, president of  
Americans for Tax Reform, opposes any federal tax on the Internet 
and wants to make permanent the current tax moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a real danger (politicians) will pick on electronic  
commerce,'' Norquist said. ``Some politicians say, 'Oh, this is 
new. Let's tax it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Most business groups fall somewhere in between, but many that  
are active on the Internet fear being targeted with taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Kelly, vice president in Schwab's Washington office, said  
the investment firm now does up to $4 billion in trades a day on 
line. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a company like Schwab, our customers are already taxed,''  
Kelly said. ``We are concerned that new taxes will impact our 
customers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Mark Nebergall, vice president of the Software &AMP; Information  
Industry Association, said Internet business is unlikely to escape 
taxation unscathed. Most companies just do not want to face a 
patchwork of taxes from some 30,000 state and local governments. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's fair and equitable for other forms of commerce ought to  
apply to electronic commerce as well,'' Nebergall said. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond U.S. borders lie many more tax questions.  
</P>
<P>
	For example, how does the United States or a state collect a tax  
on the purchase of a sweater from a European Union country? And how 
does the United States prevent its own businesses from moving 
elsewhere if domestic Internet taxes are too high? 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue we are dealing with is global,'' Gilmore said. ``You  
can buy from Akron, Ohio, or you can buy from Moscow. We don't want 
to surrender our position of world leadership in electronic 
commerce, and we could do that easily if we do something 
shortsighted.''

<HEADLINE> Fans Greet Newest NHL Champions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- After his heroics in the Dallas Stars' Stanley  
Cup-clinching victory, goaltender Eddie Belfour found a way to win 
even more fans early Sunday: He hoisted the trophy over his head 
and walked alongside the fence at Dallas-Fort Worth Airport, 
allowing onlookers to touch the elusive silver prize. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want cup! We want cup!'' shouted a crowd of about 200 fans,  
alternating between claps of appreciation and mad scrambles to get 
clearer views of the Stars making their way off the chartered plane 
and onto the team bus. 
</P>
<P>
	Belfour obliged, to the delight of the fans stretching their  
arms over the chain-link fence behind Terminal B in the gray light 
of 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know he was going to let us touch it,'' said Sara  
Fadelh, 19, who was wearing a Mike Modano jersey. ``This was all 
worth it -- staying up to 2:30, then getting up at 4:30 to come out 
here. This experience definitely ranks a 10 out of 10.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those who didn't get their hands on the trophy were still happy  
to welcome back the home team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't get to touch the cup, but that's OK,'' said Eric  
Prosser, decked out in a Stars jersey and clutching his camcorder. 
``I've got all of this on tape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Powdermaker of Dallas, who came with his 5-year-old son,  
said the Stars' triple-overtime victory that ened at about 12:30 
a.m. local time was one of the most memorable moments in Dallas 
sports history. 
</P>
<P>
	``This ranks right up there when Dallas beat Pittsburgh (in the  
1996 Super Bowl),'' Powdermaker said. ``I remember when Pittsburgh 
beat Dallas (in the 1975 and 1978 Super Bowls), so the Cowboys' 
winning was kind of sweet. This definitely is comparable to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even for fans too young to remember when the Sun Belt didn't  
have hockey teams, the celebration was sweet. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Stars are the best,'' said 10-year-old Jason Kilpatrick,  
also sporting the ever-popular Modano jersey. ``This is the best 
Father's Day present I can think of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jane Kilpatrick, Jason's mother, said the Stars' arrival in  
Dallas from Minneapolis in 1993 sparked her son's interest in the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been playing since he was four,'' Ms. Kilpatrick said.  
``He got to see a couple of playoff games and he's even got some of 
his friends hooked on hockey. It's so appropriate that the Stars 
won the cup. They're so willing to work with the kids and sign 
autographs. They're a great bunch of guys.''

<HEADLINE> Cisneros Case Focuses on Tapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- To Henry Cisneros' lawyers, 88 tapes of  
telephone conversations secretly recorded by his ex-mistress are 
``unreliable, unauthenticated copies.'' To prosecutors, they back 
up witnesses who say the former Housing secretary schemed to hide 
``hush money'' to her. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge was to hear arguments Monday on whether Linda  
Jones' tapes can be used at Cisneros' trial, set for September, on 
18 felony counts of conspiracy, obstructing justice and making 
false statements to the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, defense lawyers intend to raise questions about Ms. Jones'  
motives when she taped the conversations, and her mental health. 
Prosecutors have said they plan to have her testify during the 
proceedings, which could last two or three days. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros, a former San Antonio mayor, was secretary of the  
Department of Housing and Urban Development from 1993 to 1996. He 
was indicted in late 1997 on charges he conspired with Ms. Jones to 
conceal more than $250,000 in payments to her before and during his 
service in the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros, who has pleaded innocent, acknowledged financially  
supporting Ms. Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	But prosecutors have said Cisneros falsely told the FBI during  
his Cabinet background check he never paid Ms. Jones more than 
$2,500 at one time or more than $10,000 annually. The indictment 
alleges that between 1990 and 1993, he paid her an estimated 
$264,000 in installments as high as $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros' lawyers want U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin to  
bar the tapes because they are ``unreliable, unauthenticated 
copies'' and because they were made for ``criminal or tortious 
purposes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Barrett, the government's special prosecutor, is seeking  
to use the trial to support witness testimony about the alleged 
coverup scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense team also is pressing to have its psychiatric expert  
examine Ms. Jones, who has admitted that she long suffered from 
depression, was addicted to antidepressants and once tried to kill 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense, in a motion filed earlier this month, argued an  
examination is important because Ms. Jones is the government's 
``key witness.'' Prosecutors oppose the request and say she is 
mentally competent. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones is serving a 3 1/2-year prison sentence at a federal  
medical facility in Fort Worth, Texas. She pleaded guilty last year 
to 28 counts involving fraud, conspiracy, money laundering and 
obstruction after becoming a target of Barrett's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Her earlier immunity was revoked after prosecutors caught her in  
a series of lies about evidence, including her false claim that the 
tapes she provided the government were originals. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett's office has indicated a willingness to support a  
reduced prison sentence for her -- and drop the two remaining counts 
-- based on her cooperation at Cisneros' trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers have made clear their intent to contest  
prosecutors' reliance on a witness sent to prison for lying. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government's newfound faith in Ms. Medlar is obviously  
going to be subjected to challenge,'' Cisneros lawyer Barry Simon 
said at a June 1 hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones and Cisneros, 52, became romantically involved in 1987  
while he was mayor; both were married at the time. The 2 1/2-year 
affair, which attracted extensive news coverage, ended when 
Cisneros returned to his wife and three children. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros has said he offered financial support because he felt  
sorry for Ms. Jones after their affair became public. She and her 
husband divorced and she no longer could find work as a fund 
raiser. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros' legal troubles were triggered when Ms. Jones filed a  
breach-of-contract suit against him in her hometown of Lubbock, 
Texas, in 1994, charging he had reneged on his promise to support 
her. 
</P>
<P>
	A few months later, she took her claims to the tabloid TV show  
``Inside Edition,'' where she accused Cisneros of lying to the FBI. 
Based on that accusation, Attorney General Janet Reno initiated a 
Justice Department inquiry and in 1995 requested the appointment of 
an independent counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett has spent more than $7 million on the investigation  
since his May 1995 appointment. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros is the second former Clinton Cabinet member to be  
indicted on criminal charges. One-time Agriculture Secretary Mike 
Espy was acquitted in December of all 30 corruption charges 
involving gifts he accepted from a California agricultural 
cooperative and others.

<HEADLINE> Ford Wins Cruise Control Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- An appeals court has sided with Ford Motor Co.  
in a lawsuit filed by the family of a man severely injured when his 
car went out of control and slammed into a house. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling by the 8th District Ohio Court of Appeals overturned  
Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Judge Anthony O. Calabrese Jr.'s 
decision to grant a new trial to the family of Rev. Leon Manigault. 
The 74-year-old Cleveland man was severely injured in 1993 after 
his Crown Victoria roared out of control and crashed into a 
neighbor's house. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for Manigault, who has been in a semi-comatose state  
since the accident, say cruise control caused the engines in 
certain models to accelerate rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
	Calabrese ruled that Ford had intentionally covered up data  
about cruise control in its cars. 
</P>
<P>
	But the appellate judges agreed with Ford that the original  
trial judge had been fully informed that Ford's position on sudden 
acceleration, although possibly false, made no effort to 
fraudulently conceal evidence. On Friday the judges delivered a 
24-page opinion in favor of Ford, the nation's second-largest 
automaker. 
</P>
<P>
	``The statements that Judge Calabrese made about Ford at the  
time weren't true and were something that we took offense to. We're 
glad to have this issue put behind us,'' Ford spokesman Jim Cain 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened was a tragedy and we have great sympathy for  
Rev. Manigault. But the fact of the matter is, it wasn't our 
fault.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Thomas Murray of Sandusky, who represents the  
Manigaults, said he plans to file an appeal with the Ohio Supreme 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a narrow, procedural and very technical decision that  
in no way exonerates Ford,'' Murray said. ``It hurts, but it just 
means it's going to take us a little longer.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Uses E-Mail To Stay in Touch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- On a plane, in a car, at the office:  
Gov. Jeb Bush can often be found typing away at his laptop 
answering e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	He's not alone. Governors around the country say they are  
turning to cyberspace to stay in touch. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush says he gets 100 e-mails a day -- from constituents,  
lawmakers, and journalists -- and responds to most of them 
personally. The personal contact is vital, he says. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is very easy to have a cocoon be built around a public  
figure,'' Bush writes in an e-mail interview with The Associated 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he spends 25 to 30 hours a week reading and responding  
to e-mail and finds it particularly helpful for staying in touch 
when he's on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am on a plane flying back to Miami, drinking coffee,  
watching Shakespeare in Love (great flick) and responding to 
e-mail,'' Bush writes the next evening as the e-mail interview 
continues. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the country, most governors -- or at least their offices --  
have e-mail addresses. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota gets about 120 e-mails a day,  
and staff members print out hard copy summaries for him, said 
spokeswoman Samantha Massaglia. 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, hooks up every day to read his  
e-mail, even when he's on holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the fish aren't biting, he will check his e-mail,''  
spokesman Jim Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
	But not many governors are as reliant as Bush on e-mail to keep  
in contact with ordinary people. He may take after his father; 
former President Bush was himself a prolific letter-writer. 
</P>
<P>
	Berthy De La Rosa Aponte, a South Florida woman with a severely  
disabled daughter, says she and the governor have corresponded 
frequently about a bill to improve services for people with mental 
retardation and other developmental disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she recently sent him an e-mail, and ``he responded to  
me within the hour ... to me that's amazing.'' 
</P>

<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- The German men's team dominated the European Cup on  
Sunday, winning the event for the first time since 1996, while 
Russia ran away with the women's title. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany, a European Cup winner on three successive occasions  
between 1994 and 1996, ended the two-day event with 122 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy was second with 98 1/2, while defending champion Britain was  
third with 97. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Germany's winners Sunday were Raymond Hecht, who clinched  
the javelin with a throw of 282 feet, 3 1/2 inches, and Jurgen Schult, 
who won the discus by eight feet with a throw of 215-6. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the best races of the day saw Salvatore Vincenti of Italy  
win the 3,000 meters in 7 minutes, 59.12 seconds, just ahead of 
Russia's Vyacheslav Shabunin, 7:59.47, and Driss Maazouzi of 
France, 7:59.52.

<HEADLINE> 'Tarzan,' 'Austin' Rule Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Swingers wild and groovy monopolized the  
weekend box office as ``Tarzan'' opened at No. 1 with $34.1 million 
and ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' scored $31.9 million 
to cross the $100 million mark, estimates showed Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The military thriller ``The General's Daughter'' with John  
Travolta was third with a better-than-expected $22.3 million while 
``Star Wars: Episode One -- The Phantom Menace'' had $17.8 million 
for fourth, crossing the $300 million mark last week and overtaking 
``The Lion King'' as the No. 6 movie of all time. 
</P>
<P>
	Studio executives said it was the first time they could recall  
that three movies grossed more than $20 million on the same 
weekend. Receipts for the top films totaled $123 million, up 21 
percent from the same weekend last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This says that when people make good movies, no matter how  
many, there's room in the marketplace,'' said Disney distribution 
head Chuck Viane. ``The marketplace will expand to meet as much 
demand as it needs to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The box office was led by the animated ``Tarzan,'' featuring the  
voices of Minnie Driver, Rosie O'Donnell and Tony Goldwyn, and 
songs by Phil Collins. It was best opening weekend for a Disney 
animated film since ``The Lion King,'' which debuted with $41 
million in June 1994, on its way to a domestic gross of $313 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	If the weekend estimates hold up, ``Tarzan's'' debut also will  
have topped that of ``A Bug's Life,'' with $33.3 million last 
November. 
</P>
<P>
	Close behind was the ``Austin Powers'' sequel, returning Mike  
Myers as both the international man of mystery and Austin's 
bumbling nemesis Dr. Evil. 
</P>
<P>
	``Austin 2'' dropped a steep 42 percent in the second week but  
still collected an impressive take of nearly $32 million to bring 
its total to $116.7 million. It crossed the $100 million mark on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Proving the star power of Travolta, ``The General's Daughter'' --  
which had appeared doomed to be lost in the hype over ``Tarzan,'' 
``Austin Powers'' and ``The Phantom Menace'' -- delivered a strong 
opening weekend, the best for a Travolta film since ``Face/Off'' in 
June 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Phantom Menace'' remained strong, losing just 31 percent  
of its business in the fifth week, to bring its total to $327 
million for sixth on the all-time list. In the next few weeks, it 
will easily pass No. 5 ``Forrest Gump'' ($330 million) and No. 4 
``Jurassic Park'' ($357 million) as it seeks to challenge the 
original ``Star Wars'' ($461 million) for second all-time behind 
``Titanic'' ($600 million). 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated grosses for Friday through Sunday at North American  
theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final figures 
are to be released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Tarzan,'' $34.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' $31.9 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``The General's Daughter,'' $22.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace,'' $17.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``Notting Hill,'' $7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``Instinct,'' $3.1 million  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``The Mummy,'' $3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``The Matrix,'' $1.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. ``Entrapment,'' $1.2 million.

deal that sent Roger Clemens to the New York Yankees, agreed today 
to a contract extension that could keep him with the Toronto Blue 
Jays through the 2002 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Jays picked up the $4.5-million option on Wells for  
next season and extended his deal through the 2001 and 2002 
seasons. The 2002 season will be a team option. Financial terms 
were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This solidifies where we're going and it's going to help keep  
a core together,'' Toronto president and general manager Gord Ash 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ash said the two side had been close to a deal for awhile.  
</P>
<P>
	``We talked a little bit yesterday (Saturday) and confirmed it  
(Sunday) morning but the framework of it was done a month ago 
probably,'' he said. ``It really just came down to how the dollars 
were paid out and attributed to what years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ash demurred when asked about long-term deals for young stars  
Carlos Delgado and Shawn Green. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just going to have sit back and stragetize now for a  
couple of weeks,'' Ash said. ``Those (contract talks) are not in 
the deal zone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wells, who starts today against Kansas City, is 7-5 this season  
with a 5.34 ERA. He was 18-4 last season for the Yankees, including 
a perfect game May 18 against Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	He began his career with Toronto in 1987, and has pitched for  
Detroit, Cincinnati, Baltimore and the Yankees. Wells has a career 
mark of 131-94 with 13 saves and an ERA of 4.02 in 424 games, 254 
of them starts.

<HEADLINE> Failure Changed Payne Stewart  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- His father was a salesman who went out  
the front door wearing a canary yellow sportcoat some mornings on 
the theory that it was better to have a customer remember you for 
something than not at all. 
</P>
<P>
	But William Stewart never had to impress more than a half-dozen  
people at once. When his oldest son, Payne, stood over a 15-foot 
putt on the 18th green Sunday at Pinehurst No. 2 to win the U.S. 
Open, the audience was several million times that. But this time, 
it wasn't so much about inviting attention as proving he was worthy 
of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I looked up,'' he said, ``it was about 2 feet from the  
hole and right in the center of the cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Failure, it turns out, changed Payne Stewart more than all his  
past success ever could. A year ago, on a shimmering Sunday at the 
Olympic Club near San Francisco, he began the final round four 
strokes clear of the field, then missed a birdie putt from that 
same 15 feet at the last hole and let the championship escape his 
grasp. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic is nicknamed the Graveyard of Champions because the same  
thing had happened to Ben Hogan in 1955, Arnold Palmer in 1966 and 
Tom Watson in 1987. And in the way that a curse sometimes hounds 
its victims down through the years, none of the three, among the 
greatest players the game has known, ever got hold of another major 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	When Stewart walked away from last year's disappointment, he  
vowed it wouldn't bury him. With the light fading and a steady 
drizzle falling across the Carolina sandhills, he made good on that 
promise. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I wanted to do,'' Stewart said, ``was give myself a  
chance. I never gave up. I kept plugging and I kept playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Stewart, a two-time Missouri State Amateur champion,  
wouldn't have settled for anything less. When Payne was younger, 
his father taught him to dance by having him stand on his shoes and 
then waltzing around the room. William died in 1985, but he willed 
his son more than good footwork, a golf game and a taste for 
outlandish clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of those things came rushing back when Stewart stood in the  
house he was renting near Pinehurst on Sunday morning, getting 
ready to drive over to the course. His wife, Tracey, was in the 
next room when he turned on the TV. Since it was Father's Day, 
NBC's coverage included a brief segment about the relationship 
William and Payne Stewart shared. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just stood there and bawled in front of the television,''  
Payne remembered, ``and thought a lot about my father. I probably 
got a lot of strength from that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As it happened, he would need every ounce.  
</P>
<P>
	When Stewart won his first major championship, the 1989 PGA, it  
was cast as much the result of fortune than fortitude. The lasting 
image was of Mike Reid slumped over his putter after dropping three 
strokes to par over the last two holes -- not Stewart tearing up 
Kemper Lakes' back nine in 31 and closing with a flurry of birdies. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, too, his first U.S. Open win, at Hazeltine in 1991, had  
the feel of a man in the right place at the right time. Twice, 
eventual loser Scott Simpson let Stewart climb out of a two-stroke 
ditch over the final three holes -- first to earn a shot at the 
playoff on Sunday, then again to win the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	But there were no questions left by the end of this one.  
</P>
<P>
	Stewart began the day at 1-under-par, one stroke ahead of Phil  
Mickelson and two ahead of Tiger Woods. Another stroke back was 
David Duval and Vijay Singh. Stewart knew one or two of them might 
flinch over the course of the afternoon on a layout as tough as 
this one. But he also knew he was going to have beat one or all of 
them himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, it was Mickelson, about to become a father himself,  
who pushed Stewart the hardest. 
</P>
<P>
	Twice on the back nine, the left-hander wrested the lead away.  
But he gave it back the final time at the 191-yard, par-3 17th. 
There, Mickelson hit his tee shot to 8 feet and Stewart to about 
half that distance. Mickelson missed his birdie try and Stewart 
made his, setting up the final act. 
</P>
<P>
	On 18, Stewart dumped his drive into the right rough, hacked it  
out with a 9-iron and then hit a lob wedge to 15 feet. Mickelson 
took the more conventional Open route -- hit the fairway, hit the 
green -- to 25 feet. Again, this time much more improbably, he 
missed and Stewart made. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have made a cool story for my daughter to read  
about,'' Mickelson said, ``but it's still something special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Exactly how special Mickelson may not realize until he's  
actually raised a family of his own. 
</P>
<P>
	But Stewart had no problem remembering the feeling when someone  
asked him whether this victory would supplant his first win out on 
Tour -- the 1982 Quad City Classic -- as his most cherished memory. 
</P>
<P>
	``That will never change,'' Stewart said, ``because my dad was  
there to see it.''

<HEADLINE> Saddam Among Richest Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Saddam Hussein is worth more than Queen  
Elizabeth, according to Forbes' list of billionaires. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iraqi leader, with an estimated wealth of $6 billion, is No.  
7 on the magazine's list of ``The Nonworking Rich: Kings, Queens 
and Dictators,'' a companion to its annual ranking of the world's 
wealthiest people. The British queen is No. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine, which released the list Sunday, attributed  
Hussein's wealth to oil and to an alleged smuggling operation 
controlled by his son Odai. 
</P>
<P>
	Hussein has appeared on Forbes' richest heads of state list  
since the magazine began compiling it two years ago. The list is 
headed by the Sultan of Brunei, and includes rulers from Saudi 
Arabia, Abu Dhabi, Kuwait, Dubai, Holland's Queen Beatrix, Qatar, 
Syria and lastly, Queen Elizabeth. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes estimates the queen of England's worth at $450 million or  
$16 billion, depending on whether the Royal Collection of crown 
jewels is counted.

<P>
	MIDDLE BASS ISLAND, Ohio (AP) -- Gilligan once, Gilligan always.  
</P>
<P>
	Though it's been more than three decades since Bob Denver and  
his fellow castaways made their fateful trip to ``Gilligan's 
Island,'' he's still a familiar face around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver, 64, appeared Saturday on Lake Erie's Middle Bass Island,  
where he spent the day signing autographs. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS aired 98 episodes of ``Gilligan's Island'' in 1964-67. But  
the series is syndicated in more than 30 countries, and Denver said 
fans still notice him as he walks through airports.

<HEADLINE> Man Nabbed for Chemical on Carousel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- A man who allegedly coated a playground  
carousel with skin-dissolving chemicals faces 12 counts of battery 
after people who were on the ride had to go to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Delin Swanigan, 51, was arrested and charged Saturday night,  
said Sgt. Paul Ciesielski of the Indianapolis Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven children and one adult were sent to Methodist Hospital in  
Indianapolis with irritated skin on their faces, hands, and legs 
after riding the merry-go-round at Watkins Park on Saturday 
afternoon. They were treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
	Ciesielski said Sunday that detectives still didn't know why  
Swanigan allegedly coated the ride with a jelly-like substance. 
Officials with the state department of health still were trying to 
determine what the chemical was. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was something like a drain cleaner or some acidic type of  
solvent or paint remover,'' Ciesielski said. 
</P>
<P>
	Swanigan was being held in the Marion County Lockup and will be  
formally charged on Monday. Swanigan has refused to talk to police.

<HEADLINE> Ghana 1, Australia 1, Tie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Down one goal and one player, Ghana  
rallied to tie Australia 1-1 on Sunday and enhance its reputation 
as the surprise team of the Women's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	A longshot simply to qualify for the tournament, Ghana came away  
with a tie when substitute Nana Gyamfua scored in the 76th minute 
after Julie Murray connected for Australia in the 74th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament is especially significant to Australia, hoping to  
make a strong showing before the 2000 Olympics. As host country, it 
gets one of the eight automatic berths. But if it is not among the 
eight World Cup quarterfinalists, one of those teams will not get 
an Olympic spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Ghana played with 10 players after losing Barikiso Tettey-Quao  
to the first red card of the tournament in the 25th minute when she 
tackled Joanne Peters from behind. 
</P>
<P>
	That put a bigger burden on goalkeeper Memunatu Sulemana, who  
already had been outstanding against Australia's dominant attack. 
And she came through time after time until Murray scored on a chip 
shot over the diving Sulemana from about 10 yards on the right. 
</P>
<P>
	That could have been devastating to the hopes of Ghana, which  
qualified for its first World Cup after reaching the semifinals of 
the African Women's Soccer Championships. But Ghana came right 
back, scoring 1:17 after Australia had gone ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	Vivian Mensah shot from the left side and goalkeeper Tracey  
Wheeler slapped it to the right, where Gyamfua waited. Wheeler 
tried to get to the other side, but was too late as Gyamfua 
converted the rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams kept attacking and had excellent chances in injury  
time before a crowd of 14,873 -- the smallest in the tournament's 
first two days. 
</P>
<P>
	First, Ghana was awarded a direct kick from 30 yards after  
Gyamfua collided with Australia's Traci Bartlett. But Elizabeth 
Baidu's hard shot smacked against the crossbar and bounced out. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Murray had the ball near the end line to the right of  
Sulemana. But the goalkeeper smothered the shot from a sharp angle. 
Seconds later, the game ended and Sulemana dropped to her knees, 
celebrating the tie after a busy afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other Group D game, China beat Sweden 2-1 on Saturday.  
The top two teams qualify for the quarterfinals after each plays 
three games.

	NATO, KLA Agree on Demilitarization  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO signed an agreement with ethnic  
Albanian leaders for the demilitarization of the rebel Kosovo 
Liberation Army Sunday, just hours after the last Yugoslav troops 
left Kosovo, making NATO the only remaining military force in the 
province. The departure of Serb soldiers and police prompted NATO 
to declare an official end to the bombing campaign. Yugoslavia had 
until midnight Sunday to withdraw its 40,000 troops. Shortly after 
midnight, British Lt. Gen. Mike Jackson, head of alliance forces in 
Kosovo, and Hashim Thaci, political head of the KLA signed an 
agreement that set a timetable for the demilitarization of the 
ethnic Albanian rebels.

	VELIKA KRUSA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- British forensic experts Sunday  
started gingerly probing a burned-out house said to contain the 
charred remains of ethnic Albanian massacre victims. It is among 
the first alleged atrocity sites in Kosovo chosen for scrutiny by 
the International War Crimes Tribunal. Velika Krusa was one of the 
towns cited in the indictment of Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic. According to Mihidin Duraku, who owns the house, Serbs 
in police uniforms trucked in about 40 people on March 26, marched 
them into the house, shot them and set fire to the building.

bloody naval clash and is threatening to retaliate. The North 
Korean accusations and warning came on the eve of talks between the 
two Koreas in Beijing on Monday, the first government contact 
between the two rival Korean states in 14 months. In last Tuesday's 
clash, one North Korean gunboat was sunk and several others heavily 
damaged. About 30 North Korean sailors were believed to have died. 
Seven South Korean sailors were slightly wounded.

Austin, Texas, and director of that state's Medicaid program. Gamel 
spoke on the opening day of the AMA's annual convention, where 494

the 18th hole Sunday at Pinehurst to win the U.S. Open by one 
stroke over Phil Mickelson. It was the most dramatic U.S. Open of 
the decade. One stroke behind with three holes to play, Stewart 
made a 25-foot putt for par to catch Mickelson, a 5-foot birdie 
putt on the 17th to take the lead, and then his 24th putt of the 
day to win the Open. Tiger Woods had a 70 and tied for third at 281

<HEADLINE> Falwell Paper Knocks Concert Name </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROANOKE, Va. (AP) -- The Rev. Jerry Falwell's newspaper has  
turned its attention from warning about Tinky Winky to the 
``demonic legend'' behind the female music tour called Lilith Fair. 
</P>
<P>
	Lilith Fair was created in 1997 by singer-songwriter Sarah  
McLachlan. More than 800,000 people attended the summer concert 
series last year. The third and final tour begins July 8 and 
features diverse artists such as Sheryl Crow, The Dixie Chicks and 
Queen Latifah. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many young people no doubt attend the Lilith Fair concerts not  
knowing the demonic legend of the mystical woman whose name the 
series manifests,'' an editor of National Liberty Journal wrote in 
the Parents Alert column of the June issue. 
</P>
<P>
	According to ancient Jewish literature, Lilith was created by  
God as Adam's first wife, but left Eden after refusing to be 
submissive to Adam. Lilith Fair got its name from the original 
aspect of the mystical character, a woman seeking equality and 
independence, tour publicist Ambrosia Healy said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The article in Falwell's conservative Christian newspaper,  
headlined, ``Secrets of the Lilith Fair,'' points out that there 
are many conflicting accounts of the Lilith character, and then 
outlines the darker aspects. 
</P>
<P>
	``According to pagan legend,'' the article said, Lilith dwelled  
with the demons of the earth after leaving Eden and went mad after 
witnessing the execution of her children. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a result, she went on a killing spree, seducing and  
murdering her own demonic male offspring and then slaying their 
children,'' the article said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. McLachlan said when she started the all-female tour that it  
was an effort to promote women's equality and not ``a soapbox for 
extreme feminism. It isn't about dissing men. I just think 
everybody is equal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Falwell was ridiculed after the Parents Alert column in February  
cited evidence that the creators of the ``Teletubbies'' show 
intended Tinky Winky to be a gay role model. 
</P>
<P>
	``This Lilith Fair alert is certain to draw more fire, but we  
are willing to take the heat in order to document the truth behind 
the benign appearance of this music festival,'' the article by 
senior editor J.M. Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Falwell spokeswoman Beth Bragg said the Lynchburg  
minister had not read the article in the newspaper in which he is 
listed as editor and publisher, and declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``But he has the highest regard and confidence in his editor,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. McLachlan's manager, Terry McBride, said Lilith Fair simply  
celebrates women in music. ``To say that Lilith Fair is, in fact, a 
pagan event is ignoring the actual facts and trying to create a 
spin to it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Computer Bug Forced E-Mail Shutdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The latest computer virus, a reminder that  
technology has its drawbacks, was also a throwback to simpler times 
-- perhaps two or three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if it didn't actually infect the machines on their  
desktops, the outbreak of a file-devouring scourge named 
Worm.Explore.Zip affected millions of computer users over the past 
two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	For hours or days, many companies and other organizations were  
forced to shut down their e-mail systems and computer networks to 
be disinfected or immunized. Suddenly, there was no way to dash off 
a one-line note to a co-worker across the room or across the 
continent. Suddenly, people needed to get reaquainted with quaint 
old ways of doing business. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all had to remember how to pick up a telephone and talk,''  
said Dave Suffia, a spokesman for airplane maker Boeing Co., which 
was forced on June 11 to shut down an infected e-mail system 
serving 160,000 employee accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	While hardly the most hi-tech aspects of the Internet  
revolution, e-mail and smaller-network features like instant 
messaging have become as second nature to many people as dial tones 
and light bulbs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing how quickly a lot of us became so absolutely  
dependent on e-mail,'' said Suffia, estimating that as many as 
900,000 e-mails are sent by Boeing employees every day and that 2.1 
million are received. ``We're now dependent on this as a work tool, 
a social tool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So when their e-mail systems went dark while systems managers  
were doing battle with the computer virus, many people didn't know 
what to do with themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	At the New York offices of Ericsson, the Swedish manaufacturer  
of cellular phones and other telecommunications equipment, people 
busied themselves by cleaning their desks and making coffee. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases, the response to the network outages caused by the  
Worm.Explore.Zip outbreak wasn't much different from the way people 
might react to a power outage or, back in grade school days, a snow 
storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Hopeful about rumors that employees were being sent home at  
other companies, some workers for defense contractor Lockheed 
Martin called in to ask, ``'Are we going home early? Are we closing 
the facility?,''' said Elaine Hinsdale, manager of communications 
and public affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	While the current e-mail system at Lockheed is just one year  
old, with about 111,000 users and 1 million messages transmitted 
each day, it ``has become a key tool in the way we conduct 
business,'' said Hinsdale. 
</P>
<P>
	So when Lockheed's employees lost e-mail service while the  
system was taken off line from late afternoon on June 10 until the 
morning of June 11, Hinsdale's office had to ``remind them there 
were other means of conducting business a couple of years ago 
before you had e-mail.''

<HEADLINE> Cops Shoot Runaway Bull on NY Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A bull escaped from an illegal rodeo and  
rampaged through city streets, at times charging at people, before 
police officers shot it dead on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Detective Robert Samuel, a police spokesman, said the bull was  
one of nine owned by a North Carolina-based rodeo company that 
hired a vacant lot in the New York borough of Queens for a show, 
but was ordered to shut down for lacking a permit. 
</P>
<P>
	As police watched rodeo workers loading the animals on a truck,  
one of them bolted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess he didn't want to go,'' Samuel said.  
</P>
<P>
	The animal rumbled several blocks through the neighborhood,  
pursued by cops and a rodeo worker with a lariat, who tried in vain 
to lasso it. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, officers tried to herd the bull into a parking lot, but  
it refused to cooperate and was shot dead after the police deemed 
it a menace to the public.

<P>
	There was no record crowd Sunday for the Women's World Cup  
doubleheader at Foxboro Stadium. Of course, there was no scheduled 
appearance by the U.S. team, either. 
</P>
<P>
	The attendance at Foxboro was 14,873, with a walk-up sale of  
1,292 on gameday. The crowd came to see Australia-Ghana and 
Norway-Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers were encouraged, considering that the Red Sox were at  
home, the U.S. Open was on television and it was a nice day for the 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it's a very solid crowd for the second day of the  
tournament, the first day of the tournament here at Foxboro with 
four teams that don't really have a very strong fan base in the 
area,'' said Richard Finn, Women's World Cup director of public 
reltations. ``We think it's nothing to be disappointed with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also noted that the total crowd for Saturday in San Jose and  
the Meadowlands and today at Foxboro came to 117,143, more than the 
estimated 112,000 who attended the entire 1995 Women's World Cup in 
Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SEEING RED:* Ghana received four yellow cards and a red card in  
its 1-1 tie with Australia, which got just one yellow card. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot comment on the refereeing, but I thought that the  
slightest attention drew a card,'' Ghana coach Emmanuel Afranie 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ghana played with 10 players after losing Barikiso Tettey-Quao  
to the first red card of the tournament in the 25th minute when she 
tackled Joanne Peters from behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ghana is noted for that type of play,'' Australia goalie  
Tracey Wheeler said. ``It reminded me of the men's World Cup. I 
think the red card set a standard for how this tournament will be 
played.'' 
</P>
<P>
	FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper stressed before the tournament that  
the organization would make it clear to the teams that referees 
will not allow excessive physical activity. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HAT TRICKS:* When Brazil's Sissi scored her third goal of  
Saturday's rout of Mexico, teammate Pretinha knew what she had to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got my third goal because I was jealous that Sissi scored  
three,'' Pretinha said with a laugh after the 7-1 victory in the 
World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Pretinha, a diminutive forward with an exceptional burst to the  
ball, scored early and late. She needed only 2 minutes, 10 seconds 
to get her first and had her second through 12 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	But then Sissi got her hat trick, including two on free kicks.  
</P>
<P>
	In the 90th minute, however, Pretinha got her head on a cross  
for her third score. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was thinking that I had to get three to match Sissi,'' she  
said. ``I was very fortunate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pretinha and Sissi got their hat tricks at Giants Stadium in  
front of the greatest of all Brazilian players, Pele, who was in 
the stands. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SURPRISE GOALIE:* Australia's Tracey Wheeler found out just  
Sunday morning she would be the starting goalkeeper against Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Belinda Kitching played in the last three games of the Oceania  
World Cup qualifying tournament last October and all three in the 
Australia Cup in January. Australia won five of those games and 
tied one. But Wheeler, 31, is more experienced, having played three 
games -- all losses -- in the 1995 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Greg Brown said ``both goalies played two games each (in  
tuneups for the tournament). Kitching also had a sore hand. Wheeler 
did an all right job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a surprise for me to start,'' Wheeler said after the  
1-1 tie. ``Up until a few months ago I was the No. 3 goalkeeper on 
the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *TEEN TEAM:* It might have been beaten 7-1 by Brazil on  
Saturday, but the Mexican team still has its future ahead of it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mexican girls can still dream of World Cups to come. Of the  
Mexican starters, only Andrea Rodebaugh is over 22. Four of the 
starters are teen-agers and a total of seven are 20 or under. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's team is older and much more experienced: the star  
scorers are Sissi (32) and Pretinha (23).

<HEADLINE> Avery Johnson Knows About Traveling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As many places as he's been and as many times as  
he's had to move, Avery Johnson plays basketball with a basic sense 
of insecurity. 
</P>
<P>
	He's not a franchise player like Tim Duncan or David Robinson,  
each a 7-footer, each able to dominate games with brute strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he's a journeyman point guard two wins from an NBA  
championship. Johnson is coach Gregg Popovich's on-court presence 
for the San Antonio Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always feel I'm one step from being cut,'' Johnson said  
Sunday. ``Pop might wake up one day and say, `We don't want you 
anymore.' That keeps you humble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And that's a permanent state of mind for the guy with the  
high-pitched voice who's been playing the point in the NBA for 11 
years after not even being drafted out of college. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the third time Johnson's NBA odyssey has passed through  
San Antonio. The other stops were in Seattle, where he signed 
originally as an undrafted free agent in 1988, Denver, Houston and 
Golden State. He even spent time in the U.S. Basketball League with 
the long-forgotten Palm Beach Stingrays. 
</P>
<P>
	He once was traded by Seattle for a second-round draft pick in a  
league where only the first-round picks usually mean anything. And 
the SuperSonics had to wait seven years to collect the draft 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
	He's been waived twice and signed as a free agent seven times.  
He has, as they say, been around the block. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some guys get older and worse,'' he said. ``I got older and  
better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a cerebral player in a lot of ways. The game is mental for  
me, not physical anymore. I'm not a 150-pound guy out of Southern 
University anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way to measure how good I am is by wins.''  
</P>
<P>
	And the Spurs won more games than anybody else in the league  
this season, with Johnson averaging 9.7 points and 7.4 assists and 
keeping the big guys underneath happy. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Tim and Dave, I'm always mindful of their shot  
attempts,'' he said. ``If I have to force the issue, I'll pass up 
the shot to get them the ball. You've got to keep Dave involved or 
he tends to float a little.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If that sounds a little critical, it's not unusual. Johnson  
speaks his mind and on his mind is how the Spurs, flirting with all 
kinds of playoff records for wins, are playing right now. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our offense has not been good,'' he said, shaking his head.  
``Our spacing, our passing. We're passing when we shouldn't be and 
not passing when we should. We're not close to being good 
offensively.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson has played well, with 14 points and 13 assists in the  
first two wins. He thinks he can turn his game up even further. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I don't have control and we make too many empty passes  
and shot clock violations, that's bad,'' he said. ``We've got to do 
a better job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And yet, they continue to win.  
</P>
<P>
	Johnson is 34 and brings maturity to a lineup where 23-year-old  
Tim Duncan has become the main man. AJ watches Duncan's approach to 
the postseason with some interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tim is excited,'' he said. ``But our appreciation level is  
different because our frame of reference is different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan, remember, was a lottery player, the No. 1 pick in the  
draft. He didn't have to go shopping for a team. And he'll never be 
traded for a second-round pick. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Palm Beach Stingrays?  
</P>
<P>
	No chance.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Weapons Program Debated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Energy Department's bureaucracy has failed  
to take several steps key to reducing the threat of espionage and 
should cede control of the country's nuclear weapons program to a 
new agency, the head of a presidential panel on nuclear weapons 
security said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, reiterating the  
administration's position, said he wouldn't give up authority over 
weapons production. ``What I don't want is a new agency that is 
autonomous, that does not report to me,'' he said on ``Fox News 
Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The attitude of people within that department, in that  
bureaucracy, is astounding,'' said former Sen. Warren Rudman, 
R-N.H., who headed a panel of the president's Foreign Intelligence 
Advisory Board that last week issued a highly critical report of 
the DOE's counter-intelligence efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	The report recommended creation of a largely independent agency  
within the department with responsibility for nuclear weapons 
programs, including the weapons labs, which have been the focus of 
investigations into alleged Chinese thefts of American nuclear 
weapons secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	``These weapons are not safe. These secrets are not safe. We  
have a terribly long way to go. It's been an accident waiting to 
happen for 20 years,'' Rudman said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said President Clinton issued a directive in early 1998  
outlining tough measures to tighten security at the labs, but that 
two major elements -- polygraph tests for scientists at the labs and 
better security checks for foreign visitors -- have yet to be fully 
implemented. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have had dramatic improvements,'' Richardson said while  
acknowledging there was still a long way to go. He said he had 
ordered a two-day stand-down at all the nuclear labs to test 
security measures, and that he planned to dismiss some people 
responsible for security lapses in about three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post reported in Monday editions that the federal  
government has begun administering polygraphs on the first of 5,000 
nuclear weapons scientists and other sensitive employees at the 
Energy Department. 
</P>
<P>
	It could take four years to complete an initial round of  
examinations on the federal workers and private contractors working 
with highly classified nuclear secrets, said Edward J. Curran, head 
of Energy's counterintelligence office. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, only that office's staff have been given the tests, he  
said. Richardson told The Post some employees and civil liberties 
groups are likely to protest the polygraphs and ``I fully expect 
lawsuits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson last week also named retired Air Force Gen. Eugene  
Habiger, the former commander of all U.S. strategic nuclear forces, 
to head security operations at the department. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the Senate intelligence  
committee, agreed with Rudman that, while Richardson has been 
diligent in closing security holes, a separate weapons agency was 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've said all along that the labs are not safe today, they're  
not safe tomorrow,'' Shelby said on Fox. He said several Republican 
senators plan to attach language creating the new agency to an 
intelligence spending bill to come before the Senate in the next 
few weeks.

<HEADLINE> Oakwood Homes Eyes Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Oakwood Homes Corp. says it is looking  
for a possible suitor after a series of difficult financial periods 
capped with an announcement that quarterly earnings may be only 
half of Wall Street's expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakwood, the country's largest retailer and third-largest  
builder of manufactured homes, cited soft sales in retail and 
wholesale markets in warning third-quarter income could fall as 
much as 50 percent below analysts' projections. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although business in March showed signs of improvement over  
the prior year, sales during the current quarter have exhibited 
unexpected weakness,'' Nicholas St. George, chairman and chief 
executive, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Greensboro-based company announced Friday its board of  
directors has hired Merrill, Lynch &AMP; Co. to explore the possibility 
of a sale or merger, including a management-led buyout. 
</P>
<P>
	``The board is exploring strategic alternatives. We are in a  
quiet period,'' said Jo Andrews, an Oakwood spokeswoman. ``It's not 
appropriate to comment further.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street analysts had been expecting a quarterly profit of 55  
cents a share, according to a survey by First Call Corp. The 
earnings report will be release July 28. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be the sixth consecutive quarter of disappointing  
earnings reports for Oakwood, which earned $55.4 million on $1.5 
billion in sales last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Same-store sales from April through May also were 10 percent  
lower compared to the year-ago period, Oakwood said. 
</P>
<P>
	Company stock tumbled 75 percent last year after Oakwood took  
$45 million in charges against earnings because more people 
defaulted on its mortgage loans than expected and more people than 
anticipated refinanced their loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Though shipments for the industry this year are rising, they are  
doing so more slowly than last year, according to the Manufactured 
Housing Institute. Through April, shipments were up 3 percent from 
the same period a year ago, compared with a gain of 4.4 percent in 
the first four months of 1998, according to the trade group. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakwood, which employs 12,500 people, owns 388 stores across the  
U.S. and produces manufactured homes in 32 plants. It also sells 
through independent dealers.

<HEADLINE> Stars Bring Dallas a Championship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The Dallas Cowboys are no longer riding high on  
the local sports scene. Six years after moving to town, the Dallas 
Stars have taken over. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars won the NHL title early Sunday, the first Stanley Cup  
for a team from the Sun Belt. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Stars, who moved from Minneapolis in 1993 to raised  
eyebrows about their prospects on the sunbaked plains, the Stanley 
Cup affirms hockey's place in the pantheon of Texas sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've come from the point where people didn't know what a goal  
was or any of the rules to everybody being crazy about the sport -- 
it's gone 180 degrees,'' said Craig Ludwig, one of three former 
Minnesota North Stars still on the roster. ``It's incredible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars won the first title in the 32-year history of their  
franchise early Sunday when Brett Hull scored in triple overtime, 
giving Dallas a 2-1 victory over the Buffalo Sabres in Game 6 and 
4-2 series win. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys, who have won five Super Bowls, had been the only  
local team to win a major sports title. Baseball's Texas Rangers 
have won one playoff game since arriving in 1972; basketball's 
Dallas Mavericks haven't made the playoffs since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	While football will always be king in Texas, for now the guys  
with stars on their sweaters are more popular than the guys with 
the stars on their helmets. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first time somebody besides the Cowboys has won a  
championship. This is a whole new ball game,'' crowed Joe Nelson, 
22, resorting to a non-hockey metaphor to describe his feelings. 
``There's something besides football in Texas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great,'' Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman said earlier  
this week of the Stars' championship run. ``It brings back a lot of 
fond memories for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars' headquarters is less than a mile from the Cowboys'  
training facility in Valley Ranch, a section of suburban Irving. 
Many football players are regulars at hockey games and everyone has 
seen the city swept into a Cowboys-like frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they win, you will see this city stop talking about the  
'Boys and talk about the Stars,'' running back Emmitt Smith 
predicted Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Stars fans were asleep when the game ended at 12:32 a.m.,  
missing many newspaper deadlines but not The Dallas Morning News', 
which splashed ``Overjoyed'' across the front page. Local 
television coverage of the locker-room celebration lasted until 2 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 fans greeted the team's arrival around 6:45 a.m.,  
shouting ``We want cup! We want cup!'' as players climbed aboard a 
bus. Goaltender Ed Belfour obliged, hoisting the trophy over his 
head as he walked along a chain-link fence, allowing fans to touch 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Dallas will throw a parade followed by a rally at  
Reunion Arena. That's the 17,001-seat venue where the Stars sold 
out their last 49 games despite being ousted in last year's Western 
Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Just the opposite happened in Minnesota after the North Stars  
lost in the finals in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Small crowds prompted then-owner Norm Green to consider leaving  
Minneapolis. Dallas seemed an unlikely choice, but it was part of 
the NHL's overall plan to spread its sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Texans weren't always sure what was happening in games, but they  
bought into the slogan that the NHL was ``the coolest game on 
ice.'' Reunion Arena quickly became the place to be. 
</P>
<P>
	Two decent seasons were followed by a last-place finish and a  
front-office shakeup in 1995-96. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1995 NHL lockout hurt the team's already shaky finances,  
forcing Green to sell the team to local businessman Tom Hicks in 
December of that year. 
</P>
<P>
	A month later, Bob Gainey gave up his duties as coach to focus  
on being only the general manager. Gainey replaced himself with Ken 
Hitchcock, a Captain Kangaroo look-alike with no NHL head coaching 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Those changes set the foundation for the championship.  
</P>
<P>
	The Stars were first in their division the next season, but lost  
in the first round of the playoffs because of bad goaltending. So 
Hicks let Gainey sign Belfour, the best goalie available. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, a lack of offense let Detroit win the conference  
finals. So Hicks let Gainey sign Hull, the top scorer available. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars went on to have the league's best regular-season  
record for the second straight year, then 23 playoff games later 
won their first title. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I bought this team, I was told we had a great nucleus but  
a lousy club,'' Hicks said. ``The thing we want now is two Stanley 
Cups.''

<HEADLINE> Indians' Manny Ramirez Hit by Pitch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Manny Ramirez, baseball's RBIs leader with 79,  
was hit on the left hand by a pitch in the first inning of Sunday 
night's game against the Seattle Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
	X-rays were negative and Ramirez's status was day to day.  
</P>
<P>
	Batting against Seattle's Frankie Rodriguez in the first,  
Ramirez tried to duck under an 0-1 fastball but had it hit his 
hand. He kneeled for several minutes near the plate before going to 
first. 
</P>
<P>
	He stayed in the game and took his place in right field for the  
top of the second, but spent much of the inning looking at and 
flexing his hand. He was replaced in the top of the third by Richie 
Sexson. 
</P>
<P>
	Indians officials said Ramirez had a bruised bone just above the  
knuckle on his index finger. 
</P>
<P>
	He is hitting .347 with 19 homers and is currently on pace to  
drive in 197 runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of injuries, the Indians have only been able to use  
their opening day lineup four times all year and not at all since 
April 22. Still, they owned the majors best record entering 
Sunday's game at 44-21.

<HEADLINE> Hamm Asserts Herself in World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	U.S. coach Tony DiCicco says he wants ``personality players.''  
In Mia Hamm, he has the most personable of all. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a personality player is like what Mia was today,''  
DiCicco said after Hamm scored 17 minutes in the United States' 3-0 
victory over Denmark in the World Cup opener Saturday. ``She wanted 
the responsibility. She wanted the ball. She wanted the 
responsibility of feeding the players in the best area for a shot, 
or taking the shot herself. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the quality of player and person Mia is. As a coach,  
you can't measure how important it is for your star player to be 
such a leader and a character person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While most of her teammates appeared nervous before the largest  
crowd ever to see a women's sporting event in the United States, 
Hamm was dominant. On her second touch of the game, she accepted a 
long pass from Brandi Chastain with her right foot. Immediately, 
Hamm tapped the ball around defender Katrine Pedersen and onto her 
left foot for a blast into the top of the net. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the kind of play special players make.  
</P>
<P>
	In the second half, after several of her setups were botched by  
teammates, she sped down right wing and sent a floating pass that 
Julie Foudy put in. 
</P>
<P>
	``Up until the first goal, we really weren't playing our game,''  
said Cindy Parlow, one of the main culprits in not converting her 
opportunities on Saturday. ``We were playing a lot of defense, and 
they were getting in (threatening position). And then we get one 
chance, and Mia puts it away. That's a veteran player for you. 
</P>
<P>
	``She settled everyone down. She scored the important goal. I  
think that did a lot for us. It relaxed us all. It was like, `OK, 
we can do this.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamm certainly can do this, but the sport's career goal-scoring  
leader has not been an overwhelming force in the biggest events. 
She scored only once as the Americans won the 1996 Olympics gold 
medal. She wasn't dominant in the '95 World Cup, when the United 
States, as defending champion, finished third. 
</P>
<P>
	But she's off to a superb start this time as the Americans head  
into their second game, against Nigeria on Thursday in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a tournament like this, you want to start off on the right  
foot,'' Hamm said. ``Playing here in the U.S., with all the 
emotion, I can't tell you how proud we are. But this is just the 
beginning of what we want to accomplish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamm's teammates anticipate she will perform well under any  
circumstance. They do warn outsiders, however, not to predict too 
much for her -- or any single player. 
</P>
<P>
	``Expecting her to score three goals a game is not realistic,''  
Chastain said. ``Expecting her to score a goal a game is realistic 
because she's that good. The only pressure Mia feels is to be the 
best player she can be. Mia knows if the team is a success, it's 
because she's part of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A big part of it. Denmark could not handle her and other teams  
will need to devise specific defenses to slow her. That, of course, 
creates space and opportunities for the other accomplished scorers 
on the U.S. squad. 
</P>
<P>
	Before looking ahead to the rest of the tournament, though, Hamm  
wanted to take another moment to look back. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just a very, very proud moment for us and for our  
sport,'' she said of the opener, before 78,972, the largest crowd 
for a sports event at Giants Stadium ``We still have a long way to 
go to win the Cup, and it's not going to be easy, but what a great 
first day.''

<HEADLINE> Braves Manager Ejected From Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Atlanta manager Bobby Cox was thrown out of  
Sunday night's game against the Arizona Diamondbacks in the first 
inning, his fifth ejection of the season and second in five days. 
</P>
<P>
	Plate umpire Jeff Kellogg tossed Cox with one out and the bases  
loaded. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox never left the dugout before he was ejected, but he was  
letting Kellogg know what he thought of the strike zone after 
Atlanta's Tom Glavine walked two of his first four batters. 
</P>
<P>
	Kellogg walked to the dugout and warned Cox after Arizona's Matt  
Williams walked on a 3-2 pitch that loaded the bases. As Steve 
Finley prepared to bat, Kellogg turned to the dugout again, pointed 
at Cox and ordered him out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox rushed from the dugout to argue with Kellogg to the cheers  
of the big crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second time this season Cox was tossed in the first  
inning. It also happened May 11 in San Francisco. He also was 
tossed Wednesday at Houston.

<HEADLINE> Stars Savor Individual Triumphs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Now that the Dallas Stars have won the Stanley Cup  
with a style that relied heavily on a team concept, they can begin 
savoring what it means to them individually. 
</P>
<P>
	For Ed Belfour, Brett Hull and Mike Modano, the title is  
vindication. Each can shed their tainted reputations for a new 
identity: NHL champions. 
</P>
<P>
	For 39-year-old Guy Carbonneau, 38-year-old Craig Ludwig and  
36-year-old Brian Skrudland, former Cup winners who've kept playing 
to relive the satisfaction, victory feels even better than they 
remembered. 
</P>
<P>
	And for grinders Derian Hatcher and Pat Verbeek, knowing their  
name will forever be engraved on their sport's most cherished 
trophy is affirmation that all the lumps and bruises were worth it. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a special, magical group that will never be  
repeated,'' coach Ken Hitchcock said early Sunday following a 2-1 
triple-overtime victory over the Buffalo Sabres that secured a 4-2 
series win. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may have more talented teams or more skilled teams, but  
we'll never be as tight as this group.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars were the best regular-season team the past two years  
and if they didn't win critics would've said they peaked too soon. 
</P>
<P>
	But winning the Presidents' Trophy came in handy when Game 7 of  
the Western Conference finals between top-seeded Dallas and 
second-seeded Colorado was played at Reunion Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Sabres learned the Stars still had plenty of energy and  
passion left as they rallied from a loss in the opener, then won 
two straight games after being tied 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
	In their sixth season in Dallas, the franchise that began as the  
Minnesota North Stars ended a 32-year wait for the organization's 
first title, the longest in NHL history. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars also became the league's first champions from the Sun  
Belt -- a concept hockey fans never could've imagined when the '90s 
began. 
</P>
<P>
	A look at some of the people who made it possible and what it  
took to do it: 
</P>
<P>
	--Belfour had played more postseason games (107) without winning  
a championship than any goaltender in league history, which led to 
the knock that he cracks under pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Eagle'' soared this postseason, maintaining his cool  
during a 16-7 championship run that included two triple-overtime 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
	``I stayed focused and I stayed strong,'' said Belfour, who  
outplayed Patrick Roy in the Western finals and was at least the 
equal of Dominik Hasek in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The championship also saved Belfour's job, as Dallas will look  
to trade promising backup Roman Turek rather than expose him in the 
upcoming expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	--Joe Nieuwendyk's absence from the playoffs last year left  
Dallas a scorer away from challenging Detroit in the conference 
finals. Now they really know what they were missing as he led the 
playoffs with 11 goals, including a record-tying six game-winners. 
</P>
<P>
	He was voted postseason MVP for the second time, a decade after  
leading Calgary to the Cup. The Flyers traded him to Dallas because 
they thought he was too fragile; overcoming operations on both 
knees and enduring a grueling rehabilitation that sidelined him 
early this season proved he's not. 
</P>
<P>
	--Hull was brought in to be a postseason sharpshooter and he was,  
scoring the cup-winning goal in the third overtime early Sunday and 
knocking in the game-winner in Game 2. He did it all despite groin 
and knee injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	--Modano has shed the pretty-boy image that's hung over him his  
entire career. No one played better the last two games and he did 
it despite a broken wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ludwig and Skrudland, teammates on the 1986 Cup-winning  
Montreal Canadiens, went 13 years between titles, the longest span 
in league history. 
</P>
<P>
	--Mike Keane, whose two goals in Game 7 of the conference finals  
ousted his former Colorado teammates, became the ninth player to 
win titles with three clubs. Next up for Keane is getting this Cup 
tattooed on his ankle next to ink images of the trophies he won 
with Colorado in 1996 and Montreal in '93. Carbonneau, the league's 
oldest player this season, also won his third title. 
</P>
<P>
	--Benoit Hogue missed three weeks with two torn knee ligaments,  
then played the final two games. By delaying surgery, he risked 
further injury and guaranteed he won't be ready for the start of 
next season, which will make it tough for the free agent to find a 
job. 
</P>
<P>
	--General manager Bob Gainey, who won five Stanley Cups in his  
Hall of Fame career, put the team together in his own image. 
Third-year owner Tom Hicks opened his checkbook to let him do it. 
</P>
<P>
	--Hitchcock, a successful coach in midgets and juniors for 16  
years who didn't get a shot at the NHL until slimming down from 478 
pounds, pushed, pulled and laid off his players at all the right 
times to get the most out of the second-oldest team (30.6 years) 
ever to win an NHL title. Toronto in 1967 averaged 31.4. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you see the absolute joy and the raw emotions of the  
players, it's unbelievable,'' Hitchcock said. ``You appreciate what 
it takes to get here.''

<HEADLINE> NBA Finals Ratings Falling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC is finally feeling the effect of the  
post-Michael Jordan era, with its lowest ratings ever in the NBA 
Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	After the lowest Game 1 rating in 13 years, NBC posted a 10.0  
preliminary rating for Game 2 between the New York Knicks and San 
Antonio Spurs on Friday night, the network said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The overnight rating represents 64 percent of the country. The  
national rating will be released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10.0 rating was 44 percent lower than last year's Game 2,  
between Jordan's Chicago Bulls and the Utah Jazz, and 21 percent 
lower than the second game in 1994 between the Knicks and Houston 
Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1994 final (12.4 rating), the last season to be played  
entirely without Jordan, was NBC's lowest rated in its eight years 
of showing the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, after basically a decade of the greatest athlete of  
this generation, we're due for a building year,'' NBC Sports 
chairman Dick Ebersol said, ``and this may be ours. 
</P>
<P>
	``My thought was we'd be off 25-30 percent. When it's all over,  
if it goes six games we'll be right there. If it's a four-game 
sweep, we'll be lower.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The combination of Jordan's retirement, the lockout, two  
uncompetitive games and ugly basketball, have kept viewers away. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC was helped by competitive six-game series the last two years  
and the speculation that Jordan could retire. Six of the eight 
highest-rated finals involved Jordan's Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, the network has San Antonio, the smallest market in  
the NBA, and a banged-up Knicks team playing without Patrick Ewing 
and with a hobbling Larry Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not a medic unit,'' Ebersol said. ``We can't deal with  
the injuries of Ewing and Johnson. We'll wish for a competitive 
game to put us back in line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ebersol says the network won't have to give make-good spots to  
advertisers who were expecting higher ratings because of 
better-than-expected numbers in the regular season and earlier 
playoff rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox was forced to provide extra spots after the World Series,  
which was a four-game sweep and the lowest-rated ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``We so over performed our guarantees for the regular season and  
earlier rounds that we have no problems,'' Ebersol said. ``We just 
have the problem of any series, we want more than four games. 
That's up to the gods.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ratings were 16 percent lower for the first three rounds  
of the playoffs and 7 percent lower in the regular season.

	NATO, KLA Agree on Demilitarization  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO and the Kosovo Liberation Army  
early Monday signed an accord providing for the demilitarization of 
the KLA, effectively ending its existence as a military force. The 
pact was signed after midnight by British Lt. Gen. Mike Jackson, 
head of alliance forces in Kosovo, and Hashim Thaci, political head 
of the KLA. The signing occurred less than half an hour after the 
final deadline for the pullout of Serb forces from Kosovo, which 
was Sunday at midnight. Determining the future of the rebel army 
had been considered a crucial element of the Kosovo peace plan.

	Experts Examine Alleged Atrocities  
</P>
<P>
	VELIKA KRUSA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- British forensic experts today  
started gingerly probing a burned-out house said to contain the 
charred remains of ethnic Albanian massacre victims. It is among 
the first alleged atrocity sites in Kosovo chosen for scrutiny by 
the International War Crimes Tribunal. Velika Krusa was one of the 
towns cited in the indictment of Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic. According to Mihidin Duraku, who owns the house, Serbs 
in police uniforms trucked in about 40 people on March 26, marched 
them into the house, shot them and set fire to the building.

	Clinton Wants Tougher Gun Show Laws  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton appealed today from Europe  
for the House to reverse course and impose tougher controls on gun 
show sales. Top congressional Democrats looked to use the issue to 
the party's advantage in next year's elections. Clinton repeated an 
appeal, made in his weekly radio address taped yesterday, that 
lawmakers approve background checks on gun sales at flea markets 
and gun shows. The president said no one seriously has questioned 
``there would be fewer improper sales and we would make America 
safer'' if lawmakers approved those checks. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton To Live in Ark., NY  
</P>
<P>
	COLOGNE, Germany (AP) -- President Clinton said today that he  
plans to divide his post-presidential time between Arkansas and New 
York and will work hard on issues he cares about -- since he's not 
good enough at golf to become a professional. He and Mrs. Clinton, 
shortly after settling in at the White House, agreed they would 
move to New York when his time in office ended, Clinton said. ``I 
would divide my time between New York and going home to Arkansas, 
and finishing my library and doing my work there,'' he said.

	PLO Seeks End To U.S. Restrictions  
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Palestinians will ask the United States to  
repeal laws restricting U.S. dealings with the PLO, a senior 
Palestinian official said today. The Palestinians will make the 
proposal Wednesday when the U.S.-Palestinian bilateral committees 
meet in the West Bank town of Ramallah, Palestinian Minister of 
Planning Nabil Shaath told The Associated Press. Laws the 
Palestinians want repealed include one requiring the PLO to 
periodically apply for permission to run an office in Washington.

	Saddam Among Richest Leaders  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Saddam Hussein is worth more than Queen  
Elizabeth, according to Forbes' list of billionaires released 
today. The Iraqi leader, with an estimated wealth of $6 billion, is 
No. 6 on the magazine's list of ``The Nonworking Rich: Kings, 
Queens and Dictators,'' a companion to its annual ranking of the 
world's wealthiest people. The British queen is No. 10. The 
magazine attributed Hussein's wealth to oil and to an alleged 
smuggling operation controlled by his son Odai.

	Stewart Wins Dramatic U.S. Open  
</P>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- Motivated by past failures and haunted by  
bizarre breaks that always seemed to go the other way, Payne 
Stewart made a 20-foot par putt on the 18th hole today at storied 
Pinehurst No. 2 to win the U.S. Open by one stroke over Phil 
Mickelson. In the most dramatic U.S. Open of the decade, Stewart 
showed the mettle and patience required of its champion. One stroke 
behind with three holes to play, he made a 25-foot putt for par to 
catch Mickelson, a 5-foot birdie putt on the 17th to take the lead, 
and then his 24th putt of the day to win the Open.

	Dodgers Defeat Phillies 3-2  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Kevin Brown retired 17 consecutive batters  
and made a timely tag at home plate to preserve an eighth-inning 
lead today as the Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Philadelphia 
Phillies 3-2. Eric Karros hit two solo home runs for the Dodgers, 
who have won two straight after losing nine of 11. Brown (8-4) 
hardly looked as though he would be around for long when he 
stumbled through the first inning, giving up two runs. But he 
settled down in a 10-pitch second after a 33-pitch first.

<HEADLINE> Leeches Still Have Medical Value </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WESTBURY, N.Y. (AP) -- Leech Law No. 1: NEVER REUSE A LEECH.  
</P>
<P>
	This, observes Rudy Rosenberg, should be obvious: ``It won't  
feed again for another six months. And the patient might have an 
infectious disease, so you don't want to risk putting it on another 
patient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenberg should know: He's co-owner of Leeches U.S.A. Ltd., the  
nation's primary provider of medical leeches. The oozy little 
critters allow surgeons to get medieval on your severed finger, 
foot, ear or scalp while naturally aiding the healing process. 
</P>
<P>
	They work cheap, too: just $6.90 apiece, ``which I think is  
reasonable,'' says the dapper Rosenberg, who went into the leech 
business back in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Leeches U.S.A. operates from a small brick building just off the  
Long Island Expressway, a quiet suburban site where the neighbors 
include a welding firm and the telephone company. 
</P>
<P>
	The sign outside reads ``ACCURATE,'' the name shared by two  
other companies that own the space. The ``l-word'' appears nowhere, 
although Rosenberg says the neighbors know what lurks within. 
</P>
<P>
	There, in the kind of outsized fridge ordinarily used by  
florists, are thousands of imported European leeches -- the 
lifeblood of the business. 
</P>
<P>
	The creatures run about 3 inches long, and undulate through an  
assortment of fish tanks like tiny Loch Ness monsters. Rosenberg 
holds a penlight to one tank, commenting that he finds their red, 
brown and green shadings somewhat attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	This is a minority opinion.  
</P>
<P>
	Rosenberg seems an unlikely leech wrangler. A Holocaust  
survivor, he came to the United States at age 19. He eventually 
started Accurate Chemical, which provides sophisticated research 
products for scientists. 
</P>
<P>
	Now 69, goateed and nattily dressed, he sits in an office filled  
with vintage canes and walking sticks, a collection of classical 
music CDs, and a mirror bearing the likeness of Groucho Marx. 
</P>
<P>
	While the leeches are a small part of his business, they have  
become Rosenberg's calling card. 
</P>
<P>
	His partner, Marie Bonazinga, is now known through the medical  
business -- affectionately, of course -- as ``The Leech Lady.'' Even 
the mundane is transformed; Rosenberg's trips to the bank are 
invariably cause for the tellers to inquire about his charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an interesting sideline,'' Rosenberg acknowledges with a  
sly grin. ``I don't think you could make a living selling leeches, 
but it gives you a certain amount of notoriety. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something people don't forget.''  
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Leech Law No. 2: NEVER RETURN A USED LEECH.  
</P>
<P>
	A used leech, sadly, is a dead leech. Once they drop off a  
patient, their work complete, they are dropped into a deadly 
alcohol bath. 
</P>
<P>
	Before their untimely demise, though, there are amazing results.  
``I don't like to use the word miracle,'' Rosenberg says, ``but it 
is unbelievable what these leeches do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A typical tale: A finger is severed. A microsurgeon  
painstakingly reattaches it, but there are complications. 
</P>
<P>
	Enter the leech.  
</P>
<P>
	The leech digs its teeth into the flesh on either side of the  
incision, using its powerful suckers to stay attached. The blood 
flows through the leech, from the body to the reattached part. An 
anticoagulant in the leech keeps the blood flowing smoothly and 
prevents scabbing. An anesthetic released by the leech makes it 
painless. 
</P>
<P>
	Voila!  
</P>
<P>
	Not any leech will do. Only one of the world's 650 species  
qualifies: The Hirudo Medicinalis, a specialist sporting 300 tiny 
teeth laid out in the shape of a Mercedes hood ornament. 
</P>
<P>
	It's appropriate; the Hirudo is the top of the line in the leech  
world. 
</P>
<P>
	Leeches U.S.A. ships 20,000 Hirudos worldwide each year,  
although the company won't discuss exact sales figures. 
</P>
<P>
	For emergencies, there's a ``leech bank'' at Kennedy  
International Airport, allowing the company to guarantee same-day 
service if needed. The leeches are generally sold 20 to a pack. 
</P>
<P>
	``The nice thing is they can supply them on short notice,'' said  
Dr. Jerry A. Rubin, a Florida plastic surgeon who has used leeches 
in about 10 surgeries over the past five years. ``They can ship 
them within eight hours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For many doctors, including Rubin, the leech has improbably  
become part of the surgical routine: Scalpel. Suture. Leeches. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, it's no different than antibiotics or pain  
medication,'' the board-certified doctor said. The success rate for 
the leeches in Rubin's cases runs about 50 percent, which he says 
is much better than the option: ``Zero percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenberg's bloodsuckers aren't doing anything new. The first  
recorded use of leech therapy dates back 2500 years to the 
Egyptians, and it remained in vogue until the mid-1800s. 
</P>
<P>
	The traditional red, white and blue barber pole? The red stripe  
once indicated that the shop dealt in leeches. But the leech soon 
got a bad rap -- one that even Rosenberg admits was hard to dodge. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a natural revulsion,'' Rosenberg acknowledges. ``But if  
you put a leech on, having it or not having it can be the 
difference whether you can play the violin again or not. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a very powerful argument.''  
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Leech Law No 3: DO NOT FEED THE LEECHES.  
</P>
<P>
	A leech eats about once every six months. Once sated, they are  
content to lounge about for as long as three years, making them the 
shiftless brothers-in-law of the animal kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
	Leeches U.S.A., however, keeps its stable lean and mean.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our leeches,'' Rosenberg says proudly, ``are shipped in water,  
live and hungry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Which is good news for the patients. Rosenberg brings out the  
company's color brochure, complete with photos of the little 
leeches working their magic on a ring finger and a pair of 
reattached ears. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenberg recalls patients who had nicknames for their leeches,  
although they are a minority: Watching a leech get fat on your 
bodily fluids is not for the faint of heart. 
</P>
<P>
	But circumstances make for strange (hospital) bedfellows.  
</P>
<P>
	Just ask Wayne Thomas of Union Park, Fla. Earlier this year, the  
meat cutter lost a one-inch chunk of his right index finger while 
slicing a frozen pig. Dr. Rubin reattached the piece and dialed 
Leeches U.S.A. 
</P>
<P>
	The finger was saved.  
</P>
<P>
	``They're kind of slimy, and they're messy,'' Thomas admitted.  
``After you get your finger mangled by a saw, a leech isn't going 
to bother you. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trust me.''

<HEADLINE> Protesters Gather Outside Fagan Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Carrying signs saying ``Happy  
Kidnapper's Day'' and ``Know the Truth,'' about two dozen people 
gathered Sunday outside the home of kidnapper Stephen Fagan to 
decry his jail-free sentence and urge his daughters to reconcile 
with their mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Fagan, 57, was spared a trial when he pleaded guilty in  
Massachusetts last month to kidnapping his daughters 20 years ago. 
He received five years of probation and was ordered to perform 
2,000 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
	Fagan, who used fake names and social security numbers and  
reinvented himself as a socialite named Dr. William Martin in Palm 
Beach, could have faced 20 years in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Several protesters Sunday had personal stories similar to the  
Fagan saga, talking about children being abducted by desperate 
parents in the midst of custody battles. 
</P>
<P>
	Fagan and his family appeared to be away for the weekend. The  
oceanfront of the two-story Mediterranean house, placed on the 
market last week for $3.5 million, were shuttered as if expecting a 
hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
	Fagan's daughters, 25-year-old Rachael Martin and 22-year-old  
Lisa Martin, have stood firmly behind their father and have not 
made any effort to contact their mother.

<HEADLINE> Tiger Woods Knocked Out by Two Putts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- Tiger Woods is confident he'll win  
another major championship some day. It didn't happen at the U.S. 
Open because of two short putts that got away. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods, still seeking another major to add to his record-breaking  
victory at the 1997 Masters, finished two shots behind winner Payne 
Stewart on Sunday after missing a 2 1/2-footer at No. 11 and a 
5-footer at 17. 
</P>
<P>
	If both putts go in, Woods is teeing up with Stewart in an  
18-hole playoff Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hung in there with my short game and did everything I  
possibly could to hang in there and give myself a chance,'' said 
Woods, who shot an even-par 70 to finish 1 over for the tournament. 
``I'm very pleased with my performance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He fell three shots off the lead with his bogey at the 453-yard  
11th, pulling the near-gimme putt past the cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eleven was a putt I should have made,'' Woods said. ``But if  
you look at my entire week, I made a lot of putts to save myself. A 
lot of putts from 15 feet in just for pars, and without those I 
wouldn't have been in the position I was coming down the stretch to 
win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two of Woods' best putts came after his miss at 11.  
</P>
<P>
	He rolled in a 20-footer for birdie on the 14th, kneeling to the  
ground and pumping his right fist when the ball fell from sight. 
Two holes later, he made a marvelous second shot to set up a 
15-foot putt. When that one dropped, too -- only the 11th birdie all 
week at the second toughest hole on the course -- his fist cut 
through the air even harder. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods put his tee shot at the par-3 17th into a bunker, then  
tried to save himself with his sand wedge. The shot rolled past the 
hole and seemed to stop no more than 5 feet away, though Woods 
insisted he had at least an 8-footer. 
</P>
<P>
	Either way, the putt spun out of the cup, forcing him to tap in  
for a bogey that ended his chance of winning. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was short, but not that short,'' he said. ``It's very easy  
to miss that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With one more chance to make up ground, Woods lined up a  
35-footer as the bells from a nearby church were ringing. He could 
have used a little divine intervention when the ball slid past the 
left side of hole. 
</P>
<P>
	A few minutes later, the noise at 18 was deafening when Stewart  
made a 15-footer to save par and clinch a one-shot victory over 
Phil Mickelson. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was hoping he was going to make it,'' Woods said. ``I can  
sleep a little better tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He complained that officials from the U.S. Golf Association  
pulled out their stopwatches and threatened the final groups -- 
Woods-Tim Herron and Stewart-Mickelson -- with a one-shot penalty 
for slow play. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods said the decision was disruptive and unnecessary during a  
major championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the greens as severe as they are ... it takes time to  
figure out the slopes,'' he said. ``I understand the pace-of-play 
rule, but there are exceptions to it. And by looking as these 
greens, I think that's a pretty good exception.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All in all, though, Woods was upbeat about tying for third in  
the U.S. Open at age 23. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes me feel I can definitely win,'' he said. ``I know I  
have the game, I have the mind for it and it's just a matter of 
time.''

<HEADLINE> Forbes: Billionaires Club Booms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A booming stock market and newly created  
Internet wealth has expanded the world's billionaires club and 
pushed the collective net worth of the richest 200 working people 
beyond $1 trillion, Forbes magazine says in its latest ranking of 
the billionaires around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as the Internet has sped the pace of life today, hastening  
everything from stock trading to travel planning, it also has 
accelerated the creation of wealth -- particularly among the richest 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	In its 13th annual list of the World's Billionaires, in Forbes'  
July 5 issue, the magazine counts a total 465 billionaires, and No. 
1 is Microsoft Corp. co-founder and chairman Bill Gates, with $90 
billion to his name. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine has a separate list for what it calls the ``World's  
Working Rich,'' those who made their own wealth or are working with 
their inheritance. The magazine notes that the total wealth of the 
Top 200 working rich not only surpassed $1 trillion this year, but 
their collective net worth is more than double the $463 billion 
that the top 200 billionaires had 10 years ago. Also, Gates alone 
has as much money as the top 9 on the list 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates remains by far the world's richest man as his net worth  
nearly doubled from $51 billion last year, briefly touching $100 
billion in April before the stock market retrenched somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft boosted two others into top five ranking. Co-founder  
Paul Allen was in the No. 3 spot, with a $30 billion net worth, 
behind investor Warren Buffet's $36 billion. Microsoft president 
Steven Ballmer was in fourth place, with $19.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In fifth place were the Oeri, Hoffman and Sacher families of  
Switzerland with $17 billion from the Roche pharmaceuticals 
conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
	Tied for sixth place with a net worth of $16.5 billion were oil,  
rail and telecommunications magnate Philip Anschutz and Dell 
Computer Corp. chairman Michael Dell, who at 34 was the youngest 
among the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The top 10 list is actually a top 11, because the next four  
spots, eight through 11, are held by members of the Walton family, 
heirs of the late Wal-Mart Stores Inc. founder Sam Walton. Forbes 
estimated their wealth at $16 billion each. 
</P>
<P>
	Dot-com billionaires from around the globe were catapulted onto  
this year's list. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Walker, founder of Priceline.com, and Pierre Omidyar,  
founder of Ebay, went from nowhere into the Top 50. Walker was No. 
25 with a net worth of $10.2 billion, while Omidyar was 36th 
with$10.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In another list, Forbes ranked the estimated net worths of what  
it called the world's ``Kings, Queens and Dictators.'' Leading that 
category were the Sultan of Brunei, with $30 billion in wealth, 
Saudi Arabia's King Fahd with $28 billion, Iraq's President Saddam 
Hussein with $6 billion, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands with $5.2 
billion and Syria's President Hafez Al-Assad with $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain's Queen Elizabeth has either $450 million or $16  
billion, depending on whether you count the Royal Collection, which 
includes the crown jewels and is held by the Queen in trust for the 
nation.

<HEADLINE> Hog Farmers Still Not Breaking Even / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Pork industry leaders say the hog market  
has recovered from its worst crisis in decades, but farmers aren't 
so sure. After months of losing an average of $25 on each hog sent 
to market, they have seen prices increase a bit, but they're still 
not making money. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're close to break even,'' said Karl Johnson, a hog farmer  
from Mankato, Minn. ``But we're going to have to have some 
relatively decent markets for a while to make up for the money we 
lost the last nine months or so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson and thousands of other producers traveled to Des Moines  
this month to attend the World Pork Expo, the industry's annual 
trade show. 
</P>
<P>
	While industry leaders discussed ways to restore hog prices --  
from reducing the number of pigs going to market to opening more 
slaughtering plants -- many farmers wondered if they would be able 
to hang on. 
</P>
<P>
	``Talk to my banker,'' said Johnson, who sells about 30,000 hogs  
a year but doesn't know how much longer he'll be in business. 
``We'll see how long the banking industry wants to hang with us 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Years of expansion in the pork industry, with more huge hog  
confinement units being built, increased the number of hogs going 
to market in 1998 by about 10 percent. That, combined with plant 
closings that cut the nation's slaughter capacity by about 8 
percent, sent hog prices plummeting to lows not seen in decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Hog prices fell from 55 cents a pound, or about $165 for a  
300-pound hog, to as low as 8 cents a pound, or $24 for the same 
hog. They've rebounded some, with the same 300-pound hog today 
bringing $90 to $120. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Levitt, a livestock analyst for Alaron Trading Group in  
Chicago, said the glut of hogs going to market during the past year 
has built up ``a mountain'' of processed pork in cold storage. And, 
he said, depressed foreign markets continue to hold back exports, 
leaving a reduced domestic supply of fresh pork as the only way to 
clear out the meat in storage. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, farmers cut back the number of sows they keep  
for breeding. An Agriculture Department report said the number of 
sows farrowed from March through August should be down 7 percent 
from 1998 levels, cutting into the number of hogs going to market 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	But Darrell Axtell, a commodity broker at Cedar Rapids-based  
Securities Corp. of Iowa, said the number of hogs going to market 
today is more than USDA had predicted in March, a troubling 
indication that hog production may not have been cut back as much 
as predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	``American agriculture does the best job anywhere in the world  
in producing grain, livestock, whatever it is,'' Axtell said. ``But 
somewhere along the line, I think we've gotten so busy with 
production that we've not been very good marketers. ... We have to 
match production to demand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leo and Millie Huseman of Lafayette, Ind., said their ability to  
sell purebred pigs for show at livestock competitions has helped 
them weather the bad times. ``But if I had just a commercial herd, 
I would quit,'' said Huseman, who attended the Pork Expo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Husemans' life work is raising hogs and they can't afford to  
get out of the business. ``I've been doing this since I was a kid 
in 4-H,'' Leo Huseman said. ``It's what I've done all my life and I 
enjoy doing it. But you can't keep losing money and keep doing 
it.''

<HEADLINE> FBI May Question IOC About Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of  
the International Olympic Committee, says he'll be happy to talk 
with the FBI if it wants to question him about the Salt Lake City 
bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not worried,'' Samaranch said. ``If I am interviewed (by  
FBI agents), there will be an interview. It is no problem for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC warned its members Sunday they could face FBI  
questioning -- and possible subpoenas -- in the Salt Lake 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC director general Francois Carrard told the general assembly  
that the organization will offer legal assistance to members 
traveling to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrard noted that several members have already been  
``interviewed'' by the FBI as it investigates the vote-buying 
allegations surrounding Salt Lake's winning bid for the 2002 Winter 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is possible that the FBI investigators want to contact  
other members who are going to the United States,'' Carrard said. 
``It is technically and legally possible the investigators can 
subpoena the people they want to interview.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carrard said the FBI questioning so far had been carried out  
``in a respectful and discreet way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the IOC would provide each member with a one-page  
document outlining their legal rights and advising them how to 
contact the IOC's lawyers in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt it was our duty and responsbility to inform you of  
your legal rights,'' Carrard said. ``It is the duty of the IOC to 
protect you, defend you and assist you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carrard told reporters that three IOC members were recently  
questioned by the FBI, and that another would be soon. He declined 
to identify them. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrard said any of the IOC's 104 members could be approached by  
the FBI, not just those linked to the Salt Lake case. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch told Salt Lake organizing chief Mitt Romney this week  
that he hoped IOC members would not be hindered in entering the 
United States. He noted that the IOC executive board is scheduled 
to meet in February in Salt Lake City and Colorado Springs, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said those meetings will go ahead whether or not the  
FBI investigation is completed by then. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will respect the FBI,'' Samaranch said during a news  
conference. ``We will respect the Justice Department in the United 
States. The only thing I said is we want this problem to be 
finished as soon as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments on the final day of the four-day IOC  
session in Seoul: 
</P>
<P>
	-- The general assembly approved a code of ethics which specifies  
that members can accept gifts only of ``nominal value.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rule says those gifts can be given or accepted ``in

<HEADLINE> Puff Daddy Sorry for Losing Temper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rap star Sean ``Puff Daddy'' Combs has vowed to  
never again let his temper get the better of him, a friend said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's very upset at the perception that he let hip hop down,''  
Def Jam Records chairman Russell Simmons told Time magazine in the 
June 28 issue. ``One of his kids saw him in handcuffs on TV. That 
really upset him. He'll never let that happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Combs was arrested in April for allegedly beating record  
executive Steven Stoute, who suffered a broken arm, a broken jaw 
and cuts to his head. He said the 29-year-old rapper was one of 
three assailants. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine said Combs blamed Stoute for letting MTV air a  
music video with a scene that showed Combs nailed to a cross. 
</P>
<P>
	Combs had reportedly ordered the scene cut because he worried it  
might be offensive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sean has a strong spiritual sense and a lot of faith, and I  
told him there were things that could damage him with the church,'' 
said the Rev. Hezekiah Walker, Combs' religious adviser at the 
Pentecostal Love Fellowship Tabernacle. 
</P>
<P>
	Combs, who is set to appear in court this week, has been charged  
with second-degree assault and criminal mischief. He could face up 
to seven years in jail.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Chelsea Enjoy Father's Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLOGNE, Germany (AP) -- No backyard barbecues or garish neckties  
here. Father's Day for President Clinton meant a quick morning 
lesson on art history and High Gothic architecture with his 
daughter, Chelsea. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, it was back to the grindstone with other world  
leaders wrapping up their three-day summit. 
</P>
<P>
	The president, Chelsea and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton  
began their Sunday an hour ahead of schedule in order to catch a 
lecture and musical presentation inside Cologne Dom, the massive 
and sooty cathedral dating to 1248 that dominates the skyline of 
this city along the Rhine. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, German Chancellor Gerhard  
Schroeder, Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and Russian first 
lady Naina Yeltsin were among those sitting in pews for the 
lecture, which was in German without translation. A brief prayer 
service before the golden shrine of the Three Magi ended the 
hourlong program. 
</P>
<P>
	While the president left for his summit meetings, Mrs. Clinton  
and Chelsea stayed behind to tour the cathedral's lower crypt.

<HEADLINE> Agassi Looks Forward to Wimbledon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- As the practice match on Court 9 winds  
down, Andre Agassi provides a running commentary. Every time he 
smacks a winner, he cracks a one-liner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm like a genius out here,'' Agassi says with a grin, and the  
handful of spectators smile in agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	When he falls behind Tim Henman 4-1 in a tiebreaker, the mood  
briefly turns serious. But with the help of two perfect service 
returns that skip across the grass untouched, Agassi pulls out the 
set, then meets Henman at the net. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gimme some love,'' Agassi says, beaming as he offers a  
handshake. ``That was a great set.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, Agassi is winning and grinning again, which will make him a  
force when Wimbledon begins Monday. Two weeks after his emotional 
victory in the French Open, the most popular player in tennis hopes 
to win the game's most prestigious tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can happen,'' says Agassi, seeded fourth. ``I've stopped  
telling myself things can't be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Paris, Agassi became just the fifth man to complete a career  
Grand Slam. Now he'll try to become the first man since Bjorn Borg 
in 1980 to win the French Open and Wimbledon in the same year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously he'd like to join Borg,'' says Agassi's coach, Brad  
Gilbert. ``That's incredible company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	London oddsmakers list Agassi as a 16-1 choice, behind five-time  
Wimbledon champion Pete Sampras and four other contenders: Richard 
Krajicek, Patrick Rafter and a pair of Brits with the home-court 
advantage, Henman and Greg Rusedski. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the women, top-ranked Martina Hingis is the 6-4 favorite,  
followed by Steffi Graf, Venus Williams, Lindsay Davenport, Monica 
Seles and defending champion Jana Novotna. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras begins his bid for a record-tying 12th Grand Slam title  
Monday against Scott Draper in the first match on Centre Court. 
Among those playing on the women's side will be Graf and Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi's opening match Tuesday will be against Andrei Pavel, a  
Romanian ranked 66th. Other potential obstacles: 
</P>
<P>
	--a fourth-round rematch against Tommy Haas, who upset Agassi at  
Wimbledon last year; 
</P>
<P>
	--1996 champion Krajicek in the quarterfinals;  
</P>
<P>
	--Rafter or three-time runner-up Goran Ivanisevic in the  
semifinals; 
</P>
<P>
	--Sampras, Henman or Rusedski in the final.  
</P>
<P>
	Agassi won Wimbledon in 1992 for his first Grand Slam title, but  
since then his career has been like a series of topspin lobs: up 
and down. 
</P>
<P>
	He was an unseeded U.S. Open champion in 1994, rose to the No. 1  
ranking and then fell to No. 141. He failed to reach a Grand Slam 
quarterfinal for 2 1/2 years before winning the French, where he 
rallied past Andrei Medvedev in the dramatic final. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, at 29, Agassi claims to be playing the best tennis of his  
life. And he says this career comeback will be his last. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no more energy to go down and come back up again,'' he  
says. ``I'm going to ride this one as long as I can. I know I won't 
have many more years to enjoy this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Curiously, Agassi's resurgence coincides with the breakup of his  
marriage to actress Brooke Shields. They remain friends and spoke 
by telephone daily during the French Open, and Gilbert suggests 
that personal turmoil contributed to Agassi's renewed focus on 
tennis. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have some things going on in your life, it's nice to  
come back to something that's been good to you,'' Gilbert says. 
</P>
<P>
	``Andre has always had the game. The problem has been his brain.  
As long as he's hungry and has the passion, he's going to play 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Medvedev agrees. Ask him to list the Wimbledon favorites, and  
Agassi is the second name he mentions, behind only Sampras. 
</P>
<P>
	``I watched Andre practicing against Henman, and he was moving  
really well,'' Medvedev says. ``In their first game, he broke 
Henman's serve at love. To do that in England, you're a god.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Or at least a genius.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria 2, North Korea 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Mercy Akide, whose flashy style proved a  
crowd-pleaser at the Rose Bowl, scored once and assisted on the 
go-ahead goal Sunday night as Nigeria opened women's World Cup play 
with a 2-1 victory over North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory gave added credibility to the Nigerians as a  
contender in Group A, which includes the United States. The 
Americans face Nigeria on Thursday in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Akide, who put Nigeria ahead in the 50th minute, fed Rita  
Nwadike for a goal to snap a 1-1 tie in the 79th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking a pass on the right wing, Akide dribbled toward the right  
post -- near the spot she scored from earlier -- and passed the ball 
across the mouth of the goal. Nwadike had only to slam the ball 
into the net. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight minutes earlier, Song Ok Jo had tied it for North Korea,  
kicking in a hard crossing pass from Jong Ran Jo. 
</P>
<P>
	Akide's earlier goal came on a shot from a difficult angle near  
the goal line, with the ball slipping through the hands of 
goaltender Yong Sun Kye. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd of 17,102, less than one-fifth the Rose Bowl's  
capacity, was considerably more lively for the North Korea-Nigeria 
match than it was during the match that preceded it, a 1-1 tie 
between Germany and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Contributing to the atmosphere during the second match was a  
drum-playing contingent of some 200 Nigerian fans, many wearing 
green robes and hats. There also was a smaller group of fans 
cheering for North Korea and waving that country's flag. 
</P>
<P>
	Akide, who is extremely quick and has some dazzling moves with  
the ball, scored 10 of Nigeria's 28 goals in qualifying rounds as 
her country continued to dominate the women's game in Africa, where 
the team has not lost to an opponent from the continent in 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Koreans came into the World Cup as one of the  
tournament's mystery teams, although they showed they were 
competitive by playing China close in the finals of Asian Cup and 
Asian Games, losing 1-0 both times. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sunday's other two games, at Foxboro, Mass., Norway defeated  
Russia 2-1, and Australia and Ghana played to a 1-1 tie.

<HEADLINE> Knicks May Change Lineup for Game 3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Desperate times call for desperate measures,  
which is why the New York Knicks will likely go with some different 
lineups in Game 3 of the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some things that we're working on, I wouldn't say we  
have a lot of stuff, though,'' said Latrell Sprewell, who lobbied 
publicly Sunday for a chance to play point guard in Monday night's 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks trail the San Antonio Spurs 2-0 in the best-of-7  
series. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jeff Van Gundy called Sprewell's strategy idea ``viable,''  
although he said he would not start the game that way. A more 
likely change would be to remove Chris Dudley from the starting 
five in favor of Kurt Thomas or Marcus Camby. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy was vague when asked about lineup changes, although he  
did allow that Larry Johnson will remain in the starting five. 
</P>
<P>
	Dudley, whose hyperextended right elbow forced him to practice  
free throws left-handed Sunday, said he had not been told whether 
or not he would start. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not anticipating them changing until I see it,'' Spurs  
coach Gregg Popovich said. ``We've played against adjustments all 
year, so both teams are already prepared for a variety of things, 
It's not like something that nobody has ever thought of is going to 
happen. It's whether we adjust poorly or well that matters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No tinkering should be expected from Popovich, who would have to  
be crazy to fool with the chemistry of a team on an NBA-record 
12-game postseason winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio hasn't lost since Game 2 of the first round, back on  
May 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the series shifting to Madison Square Garden for Games  
3, 4 and 5, the Knicks know that the homecourt advantage means 
little against the Spurs. San Antonio is undefeated on the road 
(6-0) during the postseason with an average margin of victory of 
13.4 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to put serious pressure on them by winning the third  
game and kind of put the series out of reach,'' said Tim Duncan, 
averaging 29.0 points, 15.5 rebounds and three blocks over the 
first two games. ``But to stay alive, for them, that's the game 
they need right there. Going down 3-0 would be a tough thing, next 
to impossible, to come back from.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, no team in NBA history has ever come back from a 3-0  
deficit in any round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy changed his starting lineup for Game 4 of the Eastern  
Conference finals against Indiana, inserting Sprewell in place of 
Thomas. He has stuck with that lineup ever since. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, our starts haven't been bad. In Game 1, we were up six  
at the end of one. In Game 2, I think six minutes in we were up 
one,'' Van Gundy said. ``It's been more how we finish quarters and 
how we finish the game. So I just think the eight guys that are 
playing every night are going to have to play more efficiently, no 
matter how we start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If a change is made for the opening tip, Dudley is the most  
likely to find himself on the bench. He has scored only two points 
in the series, going 0-for-5 from the field and 2-for-6 at the 
line. And with the Knicks starved for points, averaging only 72 per 
game, Van Gundy may opt for a more offensively capable starter. 
</P>
<P>
	When Van Gundy was pressed on whether he plans to change  
starters, he said: ``I'm going to see how the health of our team is 
first. ... The one (idea) that's gotten a lot of play is starting 
both big guards. That's a viable option, but we're not going to 
start that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell said the team has been running plays in practice with  
him at the point and Houston at shooting guard. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks used such a lineup in Game 2 against Indiana because  
point guards Chris Childs and Charlie Ward were in foul trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	If they used it against San Antonio, they would be able to match  
up a taller player against Spurs playmaker Avery Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``It worked then, who's to say if it'll work now,'' Sprewell  
said. ``We don't know, but at least it's worth a try, I think, at 
some point during the game. ... Maybe that's something that can 
create a mismatch that favors us. 
</P>
<P>
	``If something's working, then I think you need to work it until  
they find a way to stop it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Popovich said the Spurs would not use a full-court press to take  
advantage of Sprewell's shaky ballhandling skills. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't remember the last time we pressed,'' he said. ``I  
don't think we've ever pressed, ever. Not once.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever changes Van Gundy decides on, it's clear he has to do  
something to get the Knicks out of their offensive woes. Ward is 
averaging 6.0 points and 3.0 assists, Childs is averaging 3.0 
points and 2.0 assists, Larry Johnson is shooting 20 percent from 
the field and Camby has been hindered because of foul trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs have struggled somewhat with their game, too, although  
the flaws -- 65 percent free throw shooting, getting outrebounded 
twice -- have been masked somewhat by the two victories. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't played our best basketball and they haven't played  
their best basketball,'' Duncan said. ``It's whoever kind of shows 
up.''

<HEADLINE> Sabres Bitter After Losing Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- The NHL got what it wanted most: a  
competitive, entertaining and dramatic Stanley Cup finals. It also 
got what it needed least: a possibly tainted title. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett Hull's rebound goal at 14:51 of the third overtime gave  
the Dallas Stars a cup-clinching 2-1 victory over the Buffalo 
Sabres early Sunday morning and ended the second-longest Stanley 
Cup finals game ever. 
</P>
<P>
	It also started the biggest Cup controversy in years. Several  
Sabres said the Game 6 finish will haunt them -- and, they said, the 
NHL -- for years because Hull's left skate was in the goal crease 
before he shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe everybody will remember this as the Stanley Cup that  
was never won in 1999,'' the Sabres' Joe Juneau said. ``It was 
given away to a good team, but the goal was not a legal goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With both teams nearing exhaustion in a game that was 23 seconds  
away from becoming the longest in Stanley Cup finals history, 
goaltender Dominik Hasek sprawled to play Mike Modano's shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek stopped the puck, but the rebound bounced out to Hull  
during a furious scramble at the goal mouth. Hull's first shot also 
was rejected, but he poked at the puck again and slipped it into 
the net. 
</P>
<P>
	Game over. Controversy beginning.  
</P>
<P>
	Players can play a puck in the crease, but only if it arrives  
there before they do. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if we'll ever be able to put this behind us for  
the rest of our lives,'' Jay McKee of the Sabres said. ``This is 
what we all dreamed to do and the situation to be in and, now, it's 
gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The debate isn't. NHL officials supervisor Bryan Lewis said  
Hull's goal counted because he maintained possession of the puck 
from the time he played it beyond the crease. 
</P>
<P>
	``A puck that rebounds off the goalie, the goal post, an  
opposing player is not deemed to be a change of possession,'' Lewis 
said. ``Therefore, Hull would be deemed to be in control of the 
puck, allowed to shoot and score a goal, even though the one foot 
would be in the crease in advance of the puck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the rules application seemed to violate the spirit of the  
NHL's no-tolerance policy on goal crease violations. 
</P>
<P>
	So many games were delayed this season for video reviews, and  
enough goals were wiped out by crease infractions, that the NHL's 
Board of Governors could vote as early as this week to relax the 
rule. NHL commissioner Gary Bettman hinted strongly he wants the 
rule relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
	Harry Sinden of the Boston Bruins said the topic created so much  
debate at last week's general managers meetings that if any GM 
didn't know how to curse, he does now. 
</P>
<P>
	Many general managers feel the rule penalizes teams for minor  
infractions that often have nothing to do with a play, much like a 
hitter whose home run is taken away because his toe is outside the 
batter's box. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it's over and it will be the story for a long time,'' the  
Sabres' Michael Peca said. 
</P>
<P>
	The rule interpretation creates yet again the perception that  
the NHL often governs itself by the seat of the pants rather than a 
set of rules. Sabres coach Lindy Ruff wasn't convinced the goal was 
reviewed by the video replay judge and other NHL officials, 
although Lewis said it was. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really think that if we had scored a goal like that, it  
would have been called back,'' Juneau said. ``I think because it 
was a goal that gave them the Stanley Cup, everybody jumped on the 
ice and they were afraid to make the call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there is no dispute the Stars are worthy champions. The  
Stars and the 1994 New York Rangers are the only teams in the 1990s 
to win the regular-season Presidents' Trophy and Stanley Cup in the 
same season. 
</P>
<P>
	They limited the Sabres to a record-low nine goals in six games  
and only four goals over nearly 12 periods in the final four games. 
Only one Sabres forward, Stu Barnes, scored more than one goal, and 
40-goal scorer Miroslav Satan was shut out. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars had stars aplenty, too, in the first Stanley Cup  
finals since 1994 that didn't end in a four-game sweep. 
</P>
<P>
	Goaltender Ed Belfour made 53 saves in Game 6 and, by outplaying  
Hasek, shed forever the tag of not being a big-game goaltender. 
Hull played the final two games on a left knee that needs 
reconstructive surgery and with two shredded groin muscles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought two shifts before he scored he was done for the  
night,'' Hitchcock said. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Nieuwendyk had six game-winning playoff goals and won the  
Conn Smythe Trophy winner as the playoffs MVP. Jere Lehtinen had 10 
goals, including the other Stars goal in Game 6. Defenseman Derian 
Hatcher and Richard Matvichuk shut down any forwards who dared 
challenge them in front of the net. 
</P>
<P>
	But as the Stars wearily climbed onto their bus at 4:20 a.m.  
Sunday and headed to the airport, they entrusted Belfour with the 
biggest prize of all -- the Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would not allow us to lose,'' Hitchcock said.  
</P>
<P>
	Even if some Sabres argued the Stars didn't really win.  
</P>
<P>
	When Ruff confronted Bettman and demanded an explanation for the  
crease call, the coach said he received none. 
</P>
<P>
	``Really, he just turned his back on me,'' Ruff said. ``He  
almost looked to me like he knew this might be a tainted goal and 
there was no answer for it.''

<HEADLINE> Dudley Mulls Left-Handed Free Throws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York Knicks center Chris Dudley, who doesn't  
shoot free throws very well right-handed, might try them 
left-handed in Monday night's Game 3 of the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It depends on how his elbow feels. He can't always extend it  
all the way,'' assistant coach Brendan Malone said after working 
with Dudley practicing free throws left-handed at the conclusion of 
the Knicks' practice Sunday at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	Dudley, a 46 percent career free throw shooter, made five in a  
row at one point and four in a row at another while practicing 
left-handed. He also missed quite a few. 
</P>
<P>
	Dudley said he had never attempted a free throw left-handed  
until Friday morning's shootaround, when his hyperextended right 
elbow was causing him too much pain. 
</P>

	``By game time I was able to shoot righty,'' said Dudley, who  
did not attempt a free throw and went 0-for-2 from the field in 
Game 2.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Larry Johnson and the New York Knicks were each  
fined $25,000 by the NBA on Sunday because Johnson directed 
obscenities at the media earlier in the day, and failed to make 
himself available for an entire 30-minute mandatory media session. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second series this postseason that Johnson and the  
Knicks were fined. They were also fined $10,000 by the league on 
June 8 during the Eastern Conference finals against Indiana because 
Johnson twice failed to make himself available to the media 
following practices on June 4 and 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson is averaging 11.8 points for the Knicks, who trail the  
San Antonio Spurs 2-0 in the NBA Finals.

<HEADLINE> Schools Seek Ways To Lure Teachers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Relying more on uncertified instructors,  
schools struggling with teacher shortages find college graduates 
are forsaking education for higher paying professions, a major 
teachers union reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning teachers made on average $25,735 in 1997-98, compared  
with new college graduates earning $42,862 in engineering and 
$40,920 in computer science, according to the survey being released 
Monday by the American Federation of Teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	The national average for all teachers in the 1997-98 school year  
was $39,347, according to the union. In other professional fields, 
lawyers earned $71,530, engineers made $64,489, and computer 
systems analysts drew an average paycheck of $63,072. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teaching is enormously gratifying, and many more would make it  
their career choice if they felt they were treated like 
professionals,'' said Sandra Feldman, president of the country's 
second largest teachers union. 
</P>
<P>
	Feldman said districts wanting to attract and retain teachers  
must also reduce class sizes, enforce strict discipline policies, 
modernize school buildings, and make other improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	Districts have begun offering signing bonuses and housing  
allowances, as well as issuing emergency teaching credentials, the 
survey found. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said 8.5 percent of teachers taught under temporary  
or emergency credentials in 1998-99, up from 8 percent in 1997-98. 
</P>
<P>
	The AFT and the Clinton administration have pushed states and  
districts to end emergency teacher credentials. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has proposed that within four years, 95  
percent of all teachers in a state would have to be fully certified 
or working toward obtaining certification within three years. 
</P>
<P>
	The salary reports comes as the Education Department estimates  
schools will need to hire 2.2 million teachers over the next 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The union also surveyed personnel officers in the nation's 200  
largest school districts, and found that low salaries, an aging 
teacher force and rising enrollments were the leading reasons for 
the teacher shortage. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials reported teacher shortages, especially in large  
urban districts. More than two-thirds of respondents said they did 
not have enough teacher applicants for the 1998-99 school year. 
</P>
<P>
	The school officials who hire teachers also said that districts  
had more trouble this year than four years ago in attracting 
qualified teachers. Shortages were most severe for special 
education, math and bilingual teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	The five states with the highest average teacher salaries were  
Connecticut ($51,727), New Jersey ($50,284), New York ($48,712), 
Michigan ($48,361) and Alaska ($48,275). 
</P>
<P>
	The bottom five states in 1997-98 were New Mexico ($30,309),  
Louisiana ($30,090), Mississippi ($28,691), North Dakota ($28,231) 
and South Dakota ($27,839). 
</P>
<P>
	Sources for the union's report included state education  
departments and the Education Department's survey of teacher 
salaries.

<HEADLINE> Islanders Trade Palffy to LA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) -- After many attempts to cut star right  
wing Ziggy Palffy's salary from its dwindling payroll, the New York 
Islanders were finally successful Sunday night, sending Palffy to 
the Los Angeles Kings as part of an eight-player trade. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Palffy, the Islanders sent center Bryan  
Smolinski, goaltender Marcel Cousineau and New Jersey's 
fourth-round pick in the 1999 Entry Draft to the Kings. In return, 
New York gets center Olli Jokinen, left wing Josh Green, defenseman 
Mathieu Biron and the Kings' first pick (eighth overall) in the 
upcoming Entry Draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Palffy, who was the Islanders' leading scorer this past season  
with 22 goals and 28 assists in 50 games, was deemed expendable 
with a contract that has four more years and $24 million to be 
paid. He signed the contract last Dec. 17, and missed 32 games as a 
restricted free agent. In his last three full seasons, Palffy 
scored 136 goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Smolinski was a disappointment this past season with only 16  
goals and 24 assists in 82 games. Cousineau saw action in six games 
and went 0-4-0 with a 2.87 goals-against average. The pick the 
Islanders traded away was acquired from the Devils in the deal this 
season for forward Sergei Nemchinov. 
</P>
<P>
	Jokinen, in his first full season with Los Angeles, had nine  
goals and 12 assists in 66 games. Biron played for Shawinigan in 
junior hockey. Both players were No. 1 draft pick of the Kings -- 
Jokinen, the third overall in 1997 and Biron No. 21 in 1998. Green 
played in 27 games for the Kings last season and had one goal and 
three assists. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade was made after failed attempts to send Palffy and  
defenseman Rich Pilon to the New York Rangers for a package that 
included forwards Todd Harvey and Niklas Sundstrom. Islanders 
ownership effectively killed the deal by making extra financial 
demands of the Rangers after the league approved a $2.5 million 
cash exchange. That prompted NHL commissioner Gary Bettman to 
disallow any trade of Palffy that included cash. The league also 
monitored the trade to make sure the Islanders were getting at 
least one bona-fide NHL player in the deal.

<HEADLINE> Frenchman Leads Swiss Cycling Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEIRINGEN, Switzerland (AP) -- Frenchman Laurent Jalabert showed  
his fatigue Sunday but still managed to retake the lead in the Tour 
De Suisse. 
</P>
<P>
	Jalabert, who had been leading the race since the start, lost  
the jersey to Gilberto Simoni on Saturday's arduous mountain stage, 
where he had to chase down the Simoni and Francesco Casagrande in 
the closing miles. 
</P>
<P>
	He was widely expected to retake the lead with ease in the time  
trial, but struggled throughout to finish eighth, one minute and 25 
seconds behind Russian Vjatceslave Ekimov, the stage winner. 
</P>
<P>
	However he still managed to make up enough time on Simoni to go  
ahead overall by just two seconds. Casagrande lies third, 12 
seconds behind Jalabert. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to Swiss television after the race, Jalabert admitted  
that he had been tired after Saturday's stage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will try to keep the jersey for as long as possible, but  
there are two difficult stages to come. We'll see,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Five riders are within a minute of the Frenchman in the overall  
standings. On Monday, the riders leave Switzerland for the first 
time in this year's race, with a 101-mile stage to Maurens, 
Liechtenstein.

<HEADLINE> Top Pick Has Successful Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLUEFIELD, W.Va. (AP) -- Josh Hamilton, the top pick in this  
month's amateur draft, had a successful debut weekend for the Tampa 
Bay Devil Rays' rookie league affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, who missed the Princeton Devil Rays' opener Friday  
because of a stomach ailment, homered and singled in a 2-for-5 
performance Saturday in a 10-7 victory over Bluefield. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to get adjusted,'' Hamilton said. ``The ball's coming in  
there a whole lot faster than in high school. And a wooden bat is a 
whole lot heavier than a regular (aluminum) bat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Hamilton went 1-for-3 with a single and a walk in a  
3-0 loss to Martinsville. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, who got a $3.65 million signing bonus, was the first  
high school player to be taken with the first pick since Seattle 
selected Alex Rodriguez in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite going 18-3 as a pitcher the last two seasons, Tampa Bay  
plans to develop him as a right fielder.

<HEADLINE> N.D. Honors Singer Bobby Vee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- When singer Bobby Vee played here years  
ago, Gov. Ed Schafer would sometimes lend the North Dakota native a 
few 1950s cars for ambiance. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Schafer presented Vee with something more permanent --  
the Theodore Roosevelt Rough Rider Award, the state's highest 
honor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had gold records, and I've had some wonderful honors from  
a business standpoint,'' Vee said. ``But for somebody from your 
home state to slap you on the back and say, 'Good job,' that's a 
whole different deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vee, 56, had six gold records in the 1960s, including ``Rubber  
Ball,'' ``The Night has a Thousand Eyes,'' and ``Take Good Care of 
My Baby,'' a No. 1 record in 1961. He lives in St. Cloud, Minn., 
and still performs regularly with The Vees, a band that includes 
his three sons. 
</P>
<P>
	After Vee received the award, he used the Capitol steps to stage  
a free concert for a crowd of 1,600.

<HEADLINE> Sabres' Playoff Eun Ends With a Thud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Scott Norwood's missed field goal hurt, but  
the goal that cost Buffalo the Stanley Cup caused an even deeper 
wound as the Sabres argued it wasn't even a legal shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett Hull's goal near the end of the third overtime Sunday  
morning gave Dallas a 2-1 victory to win the NHL finals series 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
	While Dallas celebrated, Buffalo was left to confront what coach  
Lindy Ruff termed ``our worst nightmare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo lost four Super Bowl games, including one when Norwood  
was wide right with a last-second, game-winning field goal. At 
least that play was legal, which some of the Sabres insisted wasn't 
the case with Hull's goal. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Bryan Lewis, the NHL's chief referee, Hull's goal  
counted because he didn't lose control of the puck as his skate 
entered the crease in front of Buffalo goalie Dominik Hasek. 
</P>
<P>
	A player is not allowed to enter the crease without the puck,  
and therein lies the difference in interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It went off Dom's glove and it went off (Brian) Holzinger's  
skate,'' Ruff said. ``It went outside the crease and his (Hull) 
foot is in the crease when he scores the goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that was the worst-case scenario,'' Ruff said. ``An  
overtime game where pandemonium sets in and they can't take it 
back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some Sabres couldn't understand why Hull's goal was allowed to  
stand. Others accepted it. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Juneau, who sank the Sabres in the 1998 Eastern Conference  
finals with a goal for the Washington Capitals, claimed the league 
lost its nerve amid the sudden storm of celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a gutless move,'' Juneau said. ``If we had scored a  
goal like that, it would have been called back. Because it was a 
goal that gave them the Stanley Cup, everybody jumped on the ice 
and they were afraid to make the call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't seen it,'' Sabres captain Michael Peca said. ``I  
don't know if I want to. We got some sort of cockamamie explanation 
but it's a situation now where we don't want to whine about it. 
It's out of our hands. It was a great game, and we don't want to 
take away from that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek and Dallas goalie Ed Belfour were brilliant in facing 104  
shots in 114 minutes, 51 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	The game ended about 1:30 a.m., nearly six hours after it began.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing left, I'll tell you that,'' Sabres forward  
Dixon Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be unfair to Dallas for this to turn into a  
controversial goal,'' Ward said. ``It would be unfair to Brett 
Hull, who's worked 15 years to get a Stanley Cup. It's a stupid 
rule anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the NHL's fault for having a stupid rule, so they can  
deal with it,'' Ward said. ``We're not going to worry about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Peca: ``We believed that we could beat the Dallas Stars  
and a couple of bounces could have made a difference for us, but 
they played very well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres' run from the No. 7 seed in the Eastern Conference to  
the Stanley Cup finals did not surprise the Dallas Stars. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to realize that this is not a seventh-seeded team,''  
Stars center Mike Modano said. ``They were one of the top two or 
three teams the whole year. They played a spectacular game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This was as good as we could play,'' Ward said. ``They were  
just a little bit better. We can't sit here and say we should have 
done this or we should have done that, because we did everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Juneau added, ``I believe everybody will remember this as  
the Stanley Cup that was never won. It was given to a good team, 
but the goal was not a legal goal.''

Mathieu Biron and the Kings' first pick (eighth overall) in the 
upcoming Entry Draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very pleased to be able to add this kind of offense to  
the team,'' Dave Taylor, the Kings' senior vice-president and 
general manager said in a conference call in Los Angeles. ``I think 
L.A. is going to love him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palffy, who was the Islanders' leading scorer this past season  
with 22 goals and 28 assists in 50 games, was deemed expendable

scored 136 goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a marquee player, one of the most exciting players in the  
game,'' Taylor said. ``Every time he touches the puck he does 
something exciting. He's very creative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor said the Kings had been talking with Palffy for at least  
a year, since the last contract dispute with the Islanders. He said 
the trade represent a $6 million increase in the Kings' payroll. 
</P>
<P>
	``Management has given us a lot of support on this,'' he said.  
``I don't think there are many teams in the NHL that would be able 
to take on an additional $6 million in annual salary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smolinski was a disappointment this past season with only 16  
goals and 24 assists in 82 games. Cousineau saw action in six games 
and went 0-4-0 with a 2.87 goals-against average. The pick the

played in 27 games for the Kings last season and had one goal and 
three assists. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never want to trade a player as special as Ziggy but we  
are very happy to get a collection of talented young players and 
our third top 10 pick in return,'' Islanders general manager Mike 
Milbury said. ``We believe Jokinen will immediately become a fan 
favorite for his talent and character, while we expect Green to be 
a solid player for us next season. There's also no doubt Biron and 
the eighth overall will emerge as important contributors to this 
franchise for years to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trade was made after failed attempts to send Palffy and

<HEADLINE> Stanley Cup a Family Affair for Hull </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- When he scored the winning goal in the  
Stanley Cup finals, Brett Hull made some history for his team as 
well as his family. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with giving the Dallas Stars their first NHL championship,  
Hull realized another distinction: He and his father, Bobby, became 
the fifth father-son combination to win a Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Appropriately, the goal that gave the Stars a 2-1  
triple-overtime victory against the Buffalo Sabres came on Father's 
Day, since the contest ended close to 2 a.m. on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett and Bobby thus joined a pantheon of fathers and sons in  
NHL lore. The others who combined to win Cups (fathers first): 
Butch and Pierre Bouchard, Lidio and Lee Fogolin, Lester and Muzz 
Patrick and Lester and Lynn Patrick. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hulls have been the most productive. This season Hull joined  
the Golden Jet as the only father-son combinations to each have 
scored 1,000 points. They have 1,196 regular-season goals between 
them, not to mention Bobby's 280 additional goals in the World 
Hockey Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is unbelievable starting out as a kid growing up in that  
shadow and finally making a niche for myself,'' Brett Hull said. 
``This finally completes the cycle. I hope someday my son or 
grandkids can do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Hull was not at Saturday night's game. When asked if he  
had gotten tickets for his father, Brett Hull said he did not 
because he did not want any distractions going into the game. 
</P>
<P>
	This has been a storybook season for Brett Hull. He changed  
teams and then had to change his game to fit in with the Stars. 
Along the way, there were injuries, all the way to the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the story on Brett Hull when the dust settles is going  
to be an incredible story,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``What 
this man did to play hockey! 
</P>
<P>
	``He has (a knee injury). He has a torn groin. And he came back  
and played. He played on one leg and on the last shift (in Game 6) 
he limped around the ice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hull said he was numb after winning the Cup. And it wasn't only  
because of pain killers. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past year, the St. Louis Blues allowed him to become a  
free agent. He finally left St. Louis after 10 full seasons and 
part of another. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who would have thought that Dallas would have been a team that  
wanted Brett Hull?'' he said. ``I thought I was going to end my 
career in St. Louis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hull, who had been the Blues' top scorer and franchise player,  
came to Dallas with a reputation as a one-way forward. Nobody could 
find open ice better for a scoring opportunity. No one had a better 
slap shot from the slot. Hull had 554 goals with Calgary and St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	But defense? Forget about it.  
</P>
<P>
	When Hull came to Dallas, he saw things differently. The Stars  
were talented and closely knit, with a chance to win the Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	So he became a two-way player, and his stats showed it. Hull,  
who had once scored 86 goals in one season with the Blues, had 32 
with Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, Hull played only 60 games because of injuries, but he  
was clearly fitting in with the Stars' defense-first philosophy. 
And he loved his new teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never met guys from day one that were closer and cared more  
for each other,'' Hull said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also liked the management.  
</P>
<P>
	``To have (general manager) Bob Gainey and Ken Hitchcock bring  
me here and fit me in, and to battle great teams in the playoffs 
like Edmonton, St. Louis, Colorado and Buffalo, this is truly 
amazing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No more amazing than Hull coming back to play in the finals  
after missing a game with a groin injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``The left knee and both groins are pretty well finished,''  
Hitchcock said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he made it back to the ice for Game 6 and scored the kind of  
goal typical of the grit the Stars have shown all season. He 
battled for the puck in front of the net, injuries and all, and 
finally put it past a prone Dominik Hasek. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wanted that puck so bad,'' Stars teammate Guy Carbonneau  
said. ``It's fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly no more than it was for Hull this season.

the Preakness, returned to racing Sunday and managed a neck victory 
over Colorado Song in the $125,000 Princess Stakes at Hollywood 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Kent Desormeaux, Excellent Meeting covered 1 1-16  
miles in 1:41 3-5, two-fifths of a second off the stakes record set 
by Race the Wild Wind in 1992. The 3-year-old filly paid $3.40, 
$2.60 and $2.10. 
</P>
<P>
	Excellent Meeting trailed early, moved up to third down the  
backstretch, then found herself blocked behind leaders Olympic 
Charmer and Dianehill. Desormeaux angled out for room entering the 
stretch, and Excellent Meeting closed furiously to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was heart and determination at the end,'' winning trainer  
Bob Baffert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado Song returned $6.80 and $2.60, while Dianehill was  
another three-quarters of a length back in third and paid $2.40 to 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	Excellent Meeting had won six of seven races against her own sex  
-- losing only to stablemate Silverbulletday -- before finishing 
fifth in the Kentucky Derby. She was eased in the Preakness at the 
far turn when trailing the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some guy congratulated me coming out of the paddock today,''  
Baffert said. ``I said, `For what?' He said, `For finally finding 
the right race for her.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The victory, worth $75,000, increased Excellent Meeting's career  
earnings to more than $1.2 million, with eight wins in 14 starts.

<HEADLINE>  Stars Bring Dallas a Championship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The Dallas Cowboys are no longer riding high on  
the local sports scene. Six years after moving to town, the Dallas 
Stars have taken over. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars won the NHL title early Sunday, the first Stanley Cup  
for a team from the Sun Belt. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Stars, who moved from Minneapolis in 1993 to raised  
eyebrows about their prospects on the sunbaked plains, the Stanley 
Cup affirms hockey's place in the pantheon of Texas sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've come from the point where people didn't know what a goal  
was or any of the rules to everybody being crazy about the sport -- 
it's gone 180 degrees,'' said Craig Ludwig, one of three former 
Minnesota North Stars still on the roster. ``It's incredible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars won the first title in the 32-year history of their  
franchise early Sunday when Brett Hull scored in triple overtime, 
giving Dallas a 2-1 victory over the Buffalo Sabres in Game 6 and 
4-2 series win. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys, who have won five Super Bowls, had been the only  
local team to win a major sports title. Baseball's Texas Rangers 
have won one playoff game since arriving in 1972; basketball's 
Dallas Mavericks haven't made the playoffs since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	While football will always be king in Texas, for now the guys  
with stars on their sweaters are more popular than the guys with 
the stars on their helmets. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first time somebody besides the Cowboys has won a  
championship. This is a whole new ball game,'' crowed Joe Nelson, 
22, resorting to a non-hockey metaphor to describe his feelings. 
``There's something besides football in Texas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great,'' Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman said earlier  
this week of the Stars' championship run. ``It brings back a lot of 
fond memories for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars' headquarters is less than a mile from the Cowboys'  
training facility in Valley Ranch, a section of suburban Irving. 
Many football players are regulars at hockey games and everyone has 
seen the city swept into a Cowboys-like frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they win, you will see this city stop talking about the  
'Boys and talk about the Stars,'' running back Emmitt Smith 
predicted Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Stars fans were asleep when the game ended at 12:32 a.m.,  
missing many newspaper deadlines but not The Dallas Morning News', 
which splashed ``Overjoyed'' across the front page. Local 
television coverage of the locker-room celebration lasted until 2 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 fans greeted the team's arrival around 6:45 a.m.,  
shouting ``We want cup! We want cup!'' as players climbed aboard a 
bus. Goaltender Ed Belfour obliged, hoisting the trophy over his 
head as he walked along a chain-link fence, allowing fans to touch 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Dallas will throw a parade followed by a rally at  
Reunion Arena. That's the 17,001-seat venue where the Stars sold 
out their last 49 games despite being ousted in last year's Western 
Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Just the opposite happened in Minnesota after the North Stars  
lost in the finals in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Small crowds prompted then-owner Norm Green to consider leaving  
Minneapolis. Dallas seemed an unlikely choice, but it was part of 
the NHL's overall plan to spread its sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Texans weren't always sure what was happening in games, but they  
bought into the slogan that the NHL was ``the coolest game on 
ice.'' Reunion Arena quickly became the place to be. 
</P>
<P>
	Two decent seasons were followed by a last-place finish and a  
front-office shakeup in 1995-96. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1995 NHL lockout hurt the team's already shaky finances,  
forcing Green to sell the team to local businessman Tom Hicks in 
December of that year. 
</P>
<P>
	A month later, Bob Gainey gave up his duties as coach to focus  
on being only the general manager. Gainey replaced himself with Ken 
Hitchcock, a Captain Kangaroo look-alike with no NHL head coaching 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Those changes set the foundation for the championship.  
</P>
<P>
	The Stars were first in their division the next season, but lost  
in the first round of the playoffs because of bad goaltending. So 
Hicks let Gainey sign Belfour, the best goalie available. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, a lack of offense let Detroit win the conference  
finals. So Hicks let Gainey sign Hull, the top scorer available. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars went on to have the league's best regular-season  
record for the second straight year, then 23 playoff games later 
won their first title. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I bought this team, I was told we had a great nucleus but  
a lousy club,'' Hicks said. ``The thing we want now is two Stanley 
Cups.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Air System Pilots End Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Pilots at Japan's third largest airline ended their  
strike early Sunday after management agreed to withdraw plans to 
train pilots at a subsidiary, the airline said. 
</P>
<P>
	With the agreement, operations at Japan Air System Co. returned  
to normal and no flights were canceled Sunday, said company 
spokesman Jun Miyazaki. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline had been forced to cancel 21 flights on Friday and  
another 28 on Saturday because of the walkout, Miyazaki said. 
</P>
<P>
	All the canceled flights were on domestic routes and a total of  
8,700 passengers were affected, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The strike began in April, when the airline's 712 pilots and  
copilots walked out to protest a management proposal to contract 
out some operation to a subsidiary as a cost-cutting measure. 
</P>
<P>
	But the airline had avoided cancellations by staffing flights  
with management-class pilots, who are not allowed to join unions 
under Japanese labor laws. 
</P>
<P>
	With an expansion of the strike on Friday, however,  
cancellations became unavoidable, the airline said.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Examine Animal-Hoarders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- They're dismissed as wacky animal-loving  
eccentrics, those people discovered with dozens, even hundreds, of 
pets living under one roof. 
</P>
<P>
	Animal experts have a name for them -- hoarders. But their  
behavior may not always be simply idiosyncratic, researchers say. 
It could signal mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
	The cases crop up with alarming frequency, and make for splashy  
headlines. There's the woman in Sugar Land, Texas, with 74 cats and 
dogs, a dozen of which died in a March fire; the couple in Methuen 
with as many as 150 cats discovered after a July blaze; the 
Northampton woman found last fall with 100 felines. 
</P>
<P>
	A team of Massachusetts veterinarians and psychologists is  
trying now to figure out why love for pets sometimes turns into 
animal obsession. 
</P>
<P>
	``Historically, their behavior was excused. People would say,  
`They just love animals, why not leave them alone?''' said Gary 
Patronek, director of the Center for Animals and Public Policy at 
Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine in Grafton. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, that attitude has been shifting as closer attention is  
paid to the deplorable state in which such animals often live. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoarded pets are typically worm-ridden, underfed, mangy and  
stressed out. They live -- and frequently die -- in squalor. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the worst cases are discovered after neighbors complain  
of a foul stench. That's when animal control officers or health 
inspectors find dead cats piled under couches and foot-deep 
excrement on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoarders can be prosecuted under animal cruelty laws. But  
convictions are more likely to lead to small fines than prison 
time. Many hoarders start all over again after they are caught. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no way to track exactly how many occur, although  
Patronek estimates at least 2,000 are discovered annually. 
</P>
<P>
	This year he set up a national surveillance effort to try to  
pinpoint the problem and also hopes to interview the hoarders to 
determine their motives. 
</P>
<P>
	In research published in January, Patronek studied 54 such cases  
from around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The median number of animals kept was 39, but some hoarded as  
many as 100. 
</P>
<P>
	The keepers often viewed themselves as saviors on a rescue  
mission. Of the cases studied, 76 percent involved women, and 46 
percent were over age 69. Abut half lived alone. 
</P>
<P>
	In 80 percent of the cases, animals were found dead,  
malnourished or injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Cats tend to be hoarded most often, since they are relatively  
small, quiet and easy to hide. But even farm animals have been 
kept. 
</P>
<P>
	With the high recidivism rate, Patronek said, prosecution will  
do little to curb the behavior. With help from behavioral 
psychologists and sociologists at Smith College, Boston University 
and Northeastern University, Patronek is examining whether animal 
hoarders would be better helped by mental health experts. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are forced to prosecute these folks because there  
aren't alternatives,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Norsk Owns 90 Pct. of Petroleum Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OSLO, Norway (AP) -- The Norsk Hydro ASA concern Sunday announced  
that it now controls more than 90 percent of Saga Petroleum ASA's 
shares, apparently winning a bidding war with France's Elf 
Aquitaine. 
</P>
<P>
	The 51-percent state-owned Norsk Hydro and the Norwegian state  
oil company Statoil ASA jointly bid $17.30 per share in stocks and 
cash for Saga Petroleum. Acceptances had to be postmarked by 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a news release Sunday, Norsk Hydro said a preliminary count  
showed that well over 70 percent of Saga's shareholders had 
accepted the offer by that deadline. In addition, Statoil already 
held 19.4 percent of the shares. 
</P>
<P>
	``This means the two companies, combined, will control more than  
90 percent of Saga's shares,'' the news release said. Norsk Hydro, 
an oil, fertilizers and light metals concern which is the largest 
company on the Oslo Stock Exchange, said a final figure is expected 
on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is contingent on endorsement from Norsk Hydro's  
shareholders at a meeting on Wednesday, and on approval by 
regulatory agencies in Norway and the European Union. 
</P>
<P>
	A bid by Elf, which made a cash-only offer of $16.02 per share  
for Norway's third-largest oil company, expires on Friday, June 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Norsk Hydro and Statoil have agreed to split Saga's assets so  
that Norsk Hydro gets 75 percent and the state oil company takes 
the rest. Saga's unions opposed the deal, because it would mean 
closing their company. The government favored the offer, because it 
would keep Saga's resources in Norwegian hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Saga Petroleum has reserves of roughly 1.5 billion barrels of  
oil equivalents, but had announced tough austerity measures after 
reporting losses for 1998.

<HEADLINE>  Stephen King Alert After Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEWISTON, Maine (AP) -- Stephen King was alert and in good  
spirits Sunday after surgery for injuries suffered when he was 
struck by a van while walking along a rural Maine highway. 
</P>
<P>
	The prolific best-selling horror author remained in serious but  
stable condition, and faces additional surgery this week, said 
Chuck Gill, a spokesman for Central Maine Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said King was thrown 14 feet when he was hit Saturday  
by a Dodge Caravan in rural Lovell, where he owns a summer home. 
</P>
<P>
	Chip Baker, who witnessed the accident, told WCSH-TV in Portland  
that he rushed to help King. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was bleeding and he was laying in a heap and all tangled  
up,'' Baker said. ``It just happened so quick, you know. I knew he 
was in kind of rough shape in either his leg or his hip.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gill said King suffered a collapsed lung and multiple fractures  
of the right leg and hip. He was also treated during surgery at 
around 3:30 a.m. for a scalp laceration. 
</P>
<P>
	King was conscious and alert after he emerged from the  
operation. His wife, Tabitha, his children and other relatives were 
by King's side. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been alert and he's in pretty good spirits,'' Gill said.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Sunday, hospital spokesman Laird Covey said King had  
been talking with his wife, adding, ``I know that he has been 
cracking some jokes to the staff about his condition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King was walking south on the shoulder of state Route 5 at about  
4:30 p.m. Saturday when a motorist approaching from behind lost 
control of his vehicle because of a dog that was loose inside, 
Oxford County Sheriff's deputy Matt Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to witnesses, the driver, Bryan Smith, 41, did not  
appear to be speeding, Baker said. He said no charges will be filed 
against Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	King, who lives in Bangor, may have been on one of his daily  
long walks at his summer home when he was struck, Covey said. 
Lovell is about 115 miles southwest of Bangor. 
</P>
<P>
	King has written more than two dozen novels, including ``The  
Shining,'' ``Carrie'' and ``Pet Sematary.'' King's ``The Girl Who 
Loved Tom Gordon'' is on several best seller lists this weekend.

	Ready to leave at the sound of a beeper, Mickelson was able to  
hang around until Father's Day at Pinehurst No. 2 with his wife, 
Amy, back at home in Scottsdale, Ariz., awaiting the birth of their 
first child. 
</P>
<P>
	The daddy-to-be held a one-stroke lead over Payne Stewart with  
just three holes remaining Sunday, only to surrender the advantage 
with his only bogey of the round. Mickelson then watched helplessly 
as Stewart made a birdie at 17, then rolled in a 15-footer for par 
at the final hole to clinch his second U.S. Open championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a disappointing day,'' Mickelson said. ``But in the  
next couple of days we're expecting our first child, so that evens 
it out. I'm pretty excited about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 29-year-old Mickelson is so excited about the life-changing  
event that he vowed to drop his clubs and return home as soon as 
his wife went into labor -- even if he had a chance to win his first 
major title. 
</P>
<P>
	Amy Mickelson isn't scheduled to deliver until June 30, but a  
few rocky moments early in the pregnancy made the expectant father 
a little skittish about so far away. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not worth the tournament,'' Mickelson said earlier in the  
Open. ``As important as the U.S. Open is to me and every other 
player in the field, this is the birth of my first child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson was one shot behind Stewart before they teed off  
together in the final round. Never separated by more than two 
shots, they waged a stirring battle of one-upmanship through the 
North Carolina pines on a cool, misty day. 
</P>
<P>
	At No. 15, Mickelson nearly made a 40-footer for birdie, the  
ball spinning all the way around the cup before popping out. He 
tapped in for par and took the lead for the second time when 
Stewart missed from 5 feet to save par. 
</P>
<P>
	``Going into the last three holes, I felt I had it under  
control,'' Mickelson said. ``All I needed was pars. I felt 1 under 
would be good enough to win or make a playoff at worst.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As it turned out, his math was correct. But he couldn't execute  
the game plan, missing a 6-footer to save par at No. 16 after 
making a nice chip out of the thick greenside rough. Stewart, 
meanwhile, made a 20-footer for par to reclaim a share of the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	At 17, Stewart put his tee shot within 4 feet of the cup, then  
Mickelson nearly matched him with a sterling drive that settled 7 
feet away. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson missed. Stewart didn't.  
</P>
<P>
	Going to the final hole down by a stroke, a playoff seemed  
likely when Stewart's tee shot disappeared into the tall grass off 
the right side of the fairway. Mickelson's drive was straight down 
the middle and he put his second shot 25 feet from the flag. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart laid up from the rough and chipped onto the green,  
leaving an uphill putt to save par. Mickelson was a little further 
away, with a difficult left-to-right slope to negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
	The left-hander's birdie putt slid just by the hole, leaving an  
even-par round of 70 and an even-par tournament of 280. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson moved to the edge of the green and sensed he had lost  
the tournament, even while Stewart was still studying his putt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought there was a good chance he would make it,''  
Mickelson said. ``His putt was straight uphill and he could be 
aggressive with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the ball disappeared into the cup, he walked out to shake  
Stewart's hand. The new champion put both hands around his dejected 
foe and tried to find the word's that would ease Mickelson's pain 
of once again failing to win a major despite his eighth top-10 
finish. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing like being a father,'' Stewart told Mickelson.  
</P>
<P>
	A few seconds earlier, Stewart couldn't afford to be sympathetic  
to a player who's best years are ahead of him -- both on and off the 
course. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wasn't going to hand the trophy over to him,'' Stewart,  
42, said. ``Phil is going to have an opportunity to win again. I 
might be on the short list.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson walked off the course and immediately called his wife,  
who was suffering just as much as he was. But little Amanda -- the 
name they have picked out for their child -- should help ease the 
pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``This,'' Mickelson said, ``will be over tomorrow.''

<HEADLINE> Exercise Can Reduce Diabetes Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Get away from the television, go out and take  
a walk, and you can reduce your risk of developing diabetes, a 
study finds. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need to increase your physical activity level, and you  
want to reduce your sedentary behavior, because the beneficial 
effect of exercise may be offset by your sedentary behavior if you 
spend too much time on the couch watching TV,'' said Dr. Frank B. 
Hu, a researcher at the Harvard School of Public Health. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, presented Saturday at the American Diabetes  
Association meeting in San Diego, is the first to find that the 
risk rises directly with hours spent watching television, Hu said. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous studies have found that the risk of obesity, which  
itself is a risk factor for diabetes, rises with more hours in 
front of the tube. This study finds the disease is more likely to 
develop in constant viewers even when obesity and other factors are 
taken into account. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings are based on 10 years of data for those aged 40-75  
in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. The dentists, 
podiatrists, pharmacists, optometrists and veterinarians completed 
periodic questionnaires on their health and their lifestyles. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Hu's data on 37,918 men, 1,058 developed type II  
diabetes, a condition in which the pancreas may produce less 
insulin or the body's cells become less sensitive it. Insulin 
carries the sugar glucose into the cell, where it is used for 
energy. 
</P>
<P>
	Compared with men who watched little or no TV, men who spent  
21-40 hours a week or even more watching TV had more than twice the 
likelihood of getting diabetes, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
	``A substantial number watch 21 to 40 hours per week -- about  
four or five hours a day,'' Hu said. The risk was close to three 
times higher in men who watched more than 40 hours a week. It was 
no more than two-thirds higher in men who watched 10 hours or less. 
</P>
<P>
	The study indicates that the risk goes up roughly in tandem with  
the amount of TV watched, Hu said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study did not look at why TV watching raises the risk.  
</P>
<P>
	The increase may arise because sitting eliminates even normal  
activity, commented Dr. William H. Dietz, director of the Division 
of Nutrition and Physical Activity at the federal Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	If so, just turning off the set may not be enough to lower the  
risk, Dietz said. ``If you replace TV watching with reading, there 
may not be a health benefit,'' he said. On the other hand, TV 
watching may be a marker for other lifestyle factors that could be 
the underlying causes, Dietz said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also found that even fairly comfortable levels of  
physical activity can reduce the risk of diabetes, Hu said. That's 
important because most previous researchers had focused on vigorous 
activity, such as running, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Health Professionals study looked at several forms of  
activity, including walking and running, and converted them 
statistically into levels of energy expenditure. 
</P>
<P>
	As expected, those who burned the most energy, such as those who  
ran almost every day, got the most benefit. The most active 
exercise group had about 50 percent of the diabetes risk of those 
who were sedentary. 
</P>
<P>
	But even those who did about 20 minutes of walking on most days  
had a risk reduction of more than 20 percent, Hu said. And those 
who did the 30 minutes of moderate activity on most days, as 
current federal guidelines recommend for good health, had a risk 
reduction of more than 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more you exercise, the less the risk,'' Hu said. ``Even  
light exercise is better than being completely sedentary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The exercise findings fit a research trend that shows the risk  
of developing diabetes and many other diseases goes down as the 
level of exercise goes up, commented Dr. Jody Wilkinson, a research 
physician at the Cooper Institute of Aerobics Research, Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at people who meet even minimal guidelines, they  
are going to benefit from that,'' he said. ``The majority of us 
aren't even getting the minimal levels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors prescribe physical activity for diabetics, but don't  
give it a high enough priority, in part because patients are more 
likely to take their medication than to get their exercise, 
Wilkinson said. However, the Harvard study indicates ``it doesn't 
take a regimented exercise program to make a difference,'' 
Wilkinson said.

<HEADLINE> Sabres Lose Cup But Gain Respect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- The Buffalo Sabres had hoped to make  
history in the Stanley Cup finals. Instead, they ended up repeating 
it after a disputed goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres saw their bid for a Stanley Cup snatched by the  
Dallas Stars, who made some history of their own with a 2-1 
triple-overtime win in Game 6 on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett Hull scored the winner 14:51 into the third overtime of  
the second longest game ever in the Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres disputed the goal, saying Hull violated the league's  
in-the-crease rule. The league said the goal would stand. 
</P>
<P>
	``His foot was in the crease when he scored the goal,'' Sabres  
coach Lindy Ruff said. ``You can't explain that to me. That was the 
worst nightmare right there. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have 200 people on the ice,'' Ruff said referring to the  
on-ice celebration that began shortly after Hull scored. ``They're 
not going to review it. I just wanted an explanation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even in street clothes, Buffalo still clung to the faint hope  
that its misfortune would be reversed by a ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't wait to see what's going to be done about it,'' Sabres  
forward Joe Juneau said. ``It was a gutless move.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sabres goaltender Dominik Hasek said he didn't realize the  
controversial nature of the goal until he looked at the replay; 
then he wanted to put his jersey back on and return to the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still cannot believe it,'' he said. ``It's really a shame. I  
don't know what the video judge was doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres, looking to end 29 years of frustration for a city  
whose fans needed more misery like they needed another abandoned 
building, replayed the misfortunes of the 1975 Buffalo team. 
</P>
<P>
	That team, fueled by the French Connection line of Rene Robert,  
Gil Perreault and Rick Martin, lost in the finals to the 
Philadelphia Flyers in six games and dropped the deciding game at 
Buffalo's old Aud. 
</P>
<P>
	But this time the Sabres set a new mark for frustration.  
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo's improbable run to the 1999 finals crashed on a night  
when its sputtering offense roared to life with 54 shots but could 
beat Dallas goaltender Ed Belfour only once. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres had a strong start and a powerful finish this season.  
In between, they were mediocre. 
</P>
<P>
	They led the Eastern Conference at the All-Star break but slid  
all the way to No. 7 in the seedings due to a mid-season scoring 
slump and a groin injury sustained by Hasek in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo won three playoff series as the underdog and without  
home ice advantage in each. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek, who led the Czech Republic to Olympic gold in 1998,  
failed to win Stanley Cup silver despite 49 saves Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expected it to be this hard,'' said Stars center Mike  
Modano, who came under fire from the Sabres before the series for 
suggesting they weren't a worthy opponent in the final. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone thinks they're not a great team,'' Modano said. ``But  
their goals-against was second in the league, so we knew it was 
going to be tough to create chances and opportunities. It's funny 
that everybody said they were underdogs. I didn't think that going 
into it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas got the Cup, but Buffalo earned respect.  
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't know a lot about them coming into the series, but  
any team that makes it to the Stanley Cup final is a good team,'' 
Stars center Joe Nieuwendyk said. ``They were a gritty team and 
they played hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Sabres are likely to make more noise in future  
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have a young team, they skate well, they play defense  
well and they have a great goalie,'' he said. ``They've got a good 
nucleus of players to build on.''

<HEADLINE> Umpire Leaves Note for Pitchers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Using his feet, umpire John Shulock told everyone  
at Tiger Stadium exactly how he feels about pitchers who do not 
throw the ball over the plate. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after Detroit's Brian Moehler walked two Oakland batters  
in the second inning Sunday, Shulock scratched a note in the 
infield dirt: ``3-2 Why.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shulock was working at second base. He neatly stepped out his  
message near the edge of the grass, behind the shortstop spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't understand why no one throws strikes,'' Shulock said  
after the Athletics' 6-5 victory. ``Everyone wants to go to a full 
count every time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I mean, look at the most successful pitchers, the Greg  
Madduxes and Tom Glavines. They throw strike one, strike two. Now 
they're ahead, and maybe they get a batter to swing at a bad pitch. 
But there's too much of this ball one, ball two.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shulock, known as one of baseball's better balls-and-strikes  
umpires, laughed and smiled while he made his remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just having fun out there,'' said Shulock, a member of  
the AL staff since 1979. ``Just passing time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit shortstop Deivi Cruz took note of Shulock's footwook.  
</P>
<P>
	``He read it, looked over and said, `You're right,' '' Shulock  
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	The note did not last too long, however. It got erased when  
groundskeepers swept the dirt in the middle innings. 
</P>
<P>
	There were nine walks in the Oakland-Detroit game. While walk  
totals seem to be increasing in the majors, some observers blame 
the umpires for not calling enough strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one wants to be out all night long,'' Shulock said. ``The  
pitchers don't want to be. So throw the ball over the plate and you 
might get them 1-2-3.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players occasionally use their cleats to scrawl messages in the  
infield dirt. Dick Allen became notorious in Philadelphia for his 
notes, which included ``Boo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Chicago White Sox shortstop Mike Caruso scratched out  
``Hi Deivi'' in a game against the Tigers. Caruso and Cruz had 
played against each other in the minors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the first time I've done it,'' Shulock said.  
``Sometimes you just come up with things.''

<HEADLINE> AMA Wrestles With Doctors Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Frustrated by managed care companies, hundreds of  
doctors gathered Sunday at the American Medical Association's 
annual meeting to debate the merits and risks of forming a labor 
union. 
</P>
<P>
	``American physicians are angry, frustrated and exhausted over  
the intrusions of third-party payors into the day-to-day practice 
of medicine,'' said Dr. William G. Gamel, a delegate from Austin, 
Texas, and director of that state's Medicaid program. 
</P>
<P>
	``And they are looking to us, their representatives at the  
local, state, specialty and national levels, to help them find a 
way to practice their profession as they've been trained.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gamel spoke on the opening day of the AMA's annual convention,  
where 494 delegates representing about 290,000 doctors, or about 
one-third of U.S. physicians, began meeting for five days to set 
policy for the influential group. 
</P>
<P>
	At their winter meeting in December, the delegates asked AMA  
trustees to investigate collective bargaining, and the trustees 
responded with a 70-page report that served as a starting point for 
debate about what the AMA can do without violating antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``The House of Delegates resolution was `to level the playing  
field.' ... There is no vehicle that will do that totally,'' said 
AMA board president Dr. Randolph D. Smoak Jr., in an interview last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether it's a traditional labor union or what we call a union  
without striking, ... you have to have an employer-employee 
relationship under the National Labor Relations Act. Otherwise you 
are subject to huge antitrust problems,'' he said, adding that only 
one of every seven U.S. physicians is an employee under the federal 
law's definition. 
</P>
<P>
	Some doctors who debated Sunday said the AMA must take an  
activist role. 
</P>
<P>
	``More testosterone is needed by the AMA,'' said Dr. Michael  
Connair, an orthopedic surgeon in New Haven, Conn. ``I am not 
asking that the AMA establish how a collective bargaining unit 
should be formed, it doesn't have the expertise or wisdom to do so. 
... But it does have the moral authority to establish the 
guidelines,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are now 25 states with private labor unions for  
physicians, and if the AMA does not involve itself now, with those 
that exist and those that will exist, ... then the AMA will lose 
its credibility,'' Connair said, a union activist. 
</P>
<P>
	Delegates will vote later in the week on whether to adopt a  
specific policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The delegates on Sunday elected Smoak, a surgeon from South  
Carolina, to be their new president-elect. He ran unopposed and 
will take over the largely speech-making position next summer, 
after the term of incoming president Dr. Thomas R. Reardon.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Live in Ark., NY </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLOGNE, Germany (AP) -- President Clinton, turning his attention  
to matters at home, said Sunday that he plans to divide his 
post-presidential time between Arkansas and New York and will work 
hard on issues he cares about -- since he's not good enough at golf 
to become a professional. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Hillary Rodham Clinton, if she becomes ``Senator  
Clinton,'' she would ``obviously have to spend a lot more time,'' 
in New York, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He brushed off speculation Mrs. Clinton is considering moving  
out of the White House and getting a place to live in New York. 
``Not true,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with CNN's ``Late Edition'' following his summit  
meetings with counterparts from the world's richest nations, 
Clinton also gave what amounted to a campaign speech for his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has been the most consistently seriously dedicated to the  
kinds of public issues that I think are important today, to the 
welfare of children, the strength of families, the future of 
education, quality of health care,'' he said. ``If the people of 
New York chose her, they would have somebody with 30 years of 
unbroken, consistent, committed dedication, who knows a lot and is 
great with working with people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He and Mrs. Clinton, shortly after settling in at the White  
House, agreed they would move to New York when his time in office 
ended, Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would divide my time between New York and going home to  
Arkansas, and finishing my library and doing my work there,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If she runs for the Senate, she'll obviously have to spend a  
lot more time there (in New York),'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it will be like an incumbent member of Congress running  
for re-election. That is, she's not going to stop being first lady 
and doing her other responsibilities, but she'll have to spend a 
lot more time in New York, and we'll have to get a place there for 
her to be while she's spending the time there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A New York Daily News poll Sunday gave Mrs. Clinton a slight  
lead in a hypothetical Senate race with New York City Mayor Rudolph 
Giuliani. The first lady led the mayor 47 to 39 percent, but the 
poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll also found that nearly three-fourths of voters do not  
feel it is a conflict for Mrs. Clinton to run for Senate while 
still serving as first lady. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton gave some insight into his plans for after he leaves  
office. He said he would work on issues of world peace and the 
reconciliation of people across racial and religious lines and be 
involved with young people. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to work hard,'' he said, adding that he is too young to  
retire and ``I'm not good enough to go on the senior golf tour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton ducked an opportunity to evaluate Texas Gov. George W.  
Bush's qualifications to be president. ``That's a decision the 
American people have to make,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush declared his candidacy last week for the Republican  
presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Bush must be more specific about where he stands, the  
president said. 
</P>
<P>
	``His announcement speech was very well crafted and was  
strikingly reminiscent of what those of us who call ourselves new 
Democrats have been saying since 1991,'' Clinton said, ``but on the 
specifics, I just don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turning to Vice President Al Gore, who also announced last week,  
Clinton said he ``took no offense'' if Gore was trying to distance 
himself from Clinton when he deplored Clinton's behavior in his 
affair with former intern Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't say anything that I hadn't said in much starker  
terms a long time ago.''

<HEADLINE> Norway 2, Russia 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Norway doesn't want to look ahead to a  
possible Women's World Cup championship meeting with the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Well, maybe just a little.  
</P>
<P>
	Marianne Pettersen, who had a goal and an assist as Norway  
opened defense of its title with a 2-1 win over Russia on Sunday, 
knows the Americans are favored. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's OK. They have the pressure, so we like ourselves in  
that position,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Norwegians lost to the Americans in the first World Cup  
title game in 1991 and beat them in the 1995 semifinals. Norway 
also finished third in the 1996 Olympics, losing in the semis to 
the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Their only possible meeting this year is in the final on July  
10. 
</P>
<P>
	Norway has two more first-round games, against Canada on  
Wednesday and Japan on Saturday. The top two teams in each of the 
four groups reach that round and Norway should have little trouble 
advancing. 
</P>
<P>
	``In every top sport, you must think of who you will meet  
next,'' Norway coach Per-Mathias Hogmo said, ``and Canada is who we 
are thinking of, because that's who's next.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until Sunday, his focus had been on Russia, a heavy underdog in  
its first World Cup game. Brit Sandaune scored in the 28th minute, 
Pettersen made it 2-0 in the 68th and Galina Komarova connected for 
Russia in the 78th. 
</P>
<P>
	But Norway's domination was far greater than the final score.  
</P>
<P>
	It outshot Russia 28-6 and Norwegian goalkeeper Bente Nordby  
made just one save. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the match was that close. We are a lot better  
than Russia,'' Hogmo said, ``but the Russian team is hard to beat. 
They were lucky to be in the match for as long as they were.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There is huge potential for women's soccer in Russia, but we  
need to get more participation,'' Russian coach Yurii Bystritzkii 
said. ``Our goal is to get to the next round and we must improve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He thinks Norway, the only team with a winning record against  
the Americans (11-10-1), also has to get better. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American style of play is more flexible,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	In the first game of the doubleheader before a crowd of 14,873 --  
the smallest in the tournament thus far -- Australia and Ghana tied 
1-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Norway, with only five holdovers, showed its new look could be  
just as impressive as in 1995, when Pettersen scored three goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Pettersen, whose 36 goals were the most in the Norwegian First  
Division last year, set up Sandaune's goal, then scored and nearly 
connected twice in the 90th minute and in injury time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was OK,'' Pettersen said of her performance, which  
included six of Norway's 15 shots on goal. ``I had a lot of 
chances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sandaune's shot just made it over the goal line after she  
chipped it over goalkeeper Svetlana Petko. Pettersen set it up with 
a header from the top of the box. 
</P>
<P>
	They exchanged roles on the second goal as Sandaune assisted for  
Pettersen. Sandaune made a long crossing pass into the box, where 
Russian defender Natalia Karasseva headed it away. But it went 
right to Pettersen, who rolled it in from about 6 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Norway almost scored four minutes earlier, but Anne Nymark  
Andersen's 15-yard shot hit the left goalpost. Then Pettersen 
nearly scored from 5 yards in the 90th minute and again in added 
time, when her shot, headed for an open net, was cleared by 
defender Tatiana Tcheverda.

<HEADLINE> Victims' Relatives Defend Williams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Emanuel Jones remembers his grandmother sending  
him and his brother Clifford to the grocery store that August day 
20 years ago, the day Clifford was strangled and his body dumped 
behind a Laundromat. 
</P>
<P>
	``She told us don't split up, walk together, hold hands,'' Jones  
said, recalling the fear that gripped Atlanta during 1979-81 when 
police investigated the slayings of 29 young blacks, including 
Clifford. 
</P>
<P>
	At the grocery store, Jones let Clifford stay out front to  
hustle money carrying groceries for customers, while he went inside 
to buy the breakfast food their grandmother wanted. He never saw 
his brother alive again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I blamed it all on myself for years because I let him go,''  
said Jones, now 33. ``I let him do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Partly to assuage his guilt, Jones recently returned to Atlanta  
from Chattanooga, Tenn., to launch his own investigation. For 
weeks, he pored through police files and interviewed witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I found out for one that Wayne Williams didn't kill my  
brother,'' he said. ``There were others involved in the murder .... 
My brother's case has never been solved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the investigation of Clifford's slaying officially was  
closed in 1982, after Williams was convicted of murder in two of 
the 29 deaths. Authorities blamed Williams for 22 of the other 
slayings, including Clifford's, on the basis of fiber evidence 
taken from the victims' bodies and matched to sources in Williams' 
home and cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, some of the victims' families have become defenders  
of the man blamed for killing their children, unsuccessfully asking 
the Justice Department and the city to reopen the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't want nothing else to do with it after he was  
convicted,'' said Willie Mae Mathis, mother of 11-year-old Jefferey 
Mathis, one of the slayings not officially blamed on Williams. 
``They just pushed it all under the rug.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, some victims' mothers are working with Williams' lawyers,  
trying to enlist the aid of Atlanta's black clergy to persuade the 
new Fulton County new district attorney, Paul Howard, to launch a 
new investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, an appeal filed by Williams is pending before the  
Georgia Supreme Court.

<HEADLINE> NBA Finals Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Madison Square Garden is as famous for its  
villains as it is for the tradition and rivalries that have played 
out inside the historic arena. 
</P>
<P>
	On the court Sunday during practice for Monday night's Game 3 of  
the NBA Finals, finding a villain wearing a San Antonio Spurs 
uniform was no easy task. 
</P>
<P>
	That is, until Sean Elliott opened his mouth.  
</P>
<P>
	Asked if playing in the Garden means anything to him, Elliott  
said this: 
</P>
<P>
	``At the risk of being burned at the stake, it doesn't. I grew  
up on the West Coast. I think a lot of guys from the East love this 
building and they love to play here. They followed maybe the Knicks 
and Celtics and some of the great rivalries back in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, I get goose bumps walking into the Forum. That's the  
place for me. I wasn't a Knick fan growing up. I was actually a 
Laker-hater. So to go in and beat the Lakers in the Forum meant a 
lot for me. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know people talk about MSG, but I've always walked in here  
like it was a regular arena.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Jordan electrified the Garden like no other visiting  
player, having some of his best games in the arena off Broadway. 
Reggie Miller hit some huge shots here, and rubbed many of them in 
with shameless trash talk. Every Knicks fan remembers Miller 
clutching his throat after hitting a 3-pointer in front of Spike 
Lee during the 1994 Eastern Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	So who plays this role for the Spurs? Who dons the black hat,  
talks the trash, spews the invective that ends up in back-page 
headlines? 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott's comments about the Garden aside, he doesn't exactly  
make a great villain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody knows me by now, I'm not a trash-talker,'' Elliott  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	David Robinson doesn't appear ready to seize the role, either.  
</P>
<P>
	``Madison Square Garden, what better place in the world is there  
to play when you're playing a big game?'' Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Elie, a native New Yorker who grew up near the Garden,  
knows the importance of the building. Still, he's not worried about 
putting the Spurs' 6-0 road record in the playoffs on the line. 
</P>
<P>
	``After playing in front of 39,000, I think 19,000 is going to  
be nothing,'' Elie said. ``The toughest part to me is just the 
nasty crowd you guys got here. The crowd is nasty, they're loud, 
they're knowledgeable. I mean, this is just a great, festive 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	``The music is going to be loud, the dancers are going to be  
hot. Jerry (Seinfeld) and Woody (Allen), everybody is going to be 
fired up. Spike's going to have his towel going. It's going to be a 
great challenge for our guys, and our guys are looking forward to 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NEW WHAT?:* Spurs point guard Avery Johnson loves the idea of  
coming to New York. He compares it with his native New Orleans 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a city with flare,'' he said. ``There's so much to do.  
Any town with a lot of different restaurants is good. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard for me when I go to Utah.''  
</P>
<P>
	Tim Duncan said, ``I'm not a big city guy. It's a great city, a  
lot of fun. I don't know if I could live here for any extended 
period of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *IDLE 7-FOOTER:* San Antonio center Will Perdue hasn't played a  
single minute in Games 1 and 2. If he played for the injury-ravaged 
Knicks, he'd probably be their starter. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, I've talked about that with friends,'' said Perdue,  
who played sparingly this season as the backup to backup power 
forward Malik Rose. ``I think there'd be a good possibility of it, 
yeah.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perdue was a starter for several games last season when San  
Antonio went with a Triple Towers starting frontline featuring 
himself, David Robinson and Tim Duncan. As for this series, Perdue 
is just hoping to get off the bench to do more than lean against 
the press table and stretch his calves. 
</P>
<P>
	``So far, we've had two games and I haven't had any moments,''  
Perdue said. ``But I have a feeling there will be a time for me to 
do something, and I have to remain ready for whenever that time may 
be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perdue, who will be a free agent this summer, says San Antonio  
and Detroit are the places he'd most like to play next season. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *LEAVE ME BE:* New York's Larry Johnson was 2-for-12 in Game 2,  
including 1-for-7 from 3-point range. Addressing a large crowd of 
media on Sunday, Johnson offered this profane assessment of how his 
sprained knee affected his shooting: 
</P>
<P>
	``It didn't bother me because of the pain, it bothered me  
because I couldn't practice,'' he said. ``Just like now. I can't 
get any shots up with y'all ... bothering me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later Sunday, Johnson and the Knicks were each fined $25,000 for  
the obscenities and because Johnson did not make himself available 
for the entire 30-minute mandatory media session. It was the second 
time this postseason Johnson and the team were fined. The league 
fined them $10,000 each on June 8 because Johnson twice failed to 
make himself available to the media following practices on June 4 
and 5. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WHO NEEDS TICKETS?:* Spurs forward Malik Rose has seven friends  
and family members taking a train from Philadelphia to attend Game 
3. Mario Elie, a native New Yorker, purchased 22 tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's only a couple grand, so I can live with it,'' Elie said.  
``If we win, the bonus money will make up for it.''

	BOSTON (AP) -- Chrissie Hynde is looking forward to joining the  
female-dominated Lilith Fair concerts this summer. But to her, the 
concept is more about star power than girl power. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's show business, isn't it?'' the leader of The Pretenders  
told the Sunday Boston Globe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having all women is kind of a gimmick. It's entertainment. I  
don't know if it's supposed to be anything else, but for me, that's 
what it is.''

<HEADLINE> Numbers Can Wear an Investor Out / Ticker Talk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- To see why so many advisers urge a patient,  
long-term approach to investing, look at the up-and-down numbers 
game played out on Wall Street over the past few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The April report on inflation was worse than expected, and stock  
prices plunged. Then the May consumer price index came in better 
than expected, and stock prices soared. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's a warning: By some analysts' preliminary reckoning, the  
CPI increase for June looks as though it might jump back to a scary 
level. Could the market tumble again? 
</P>
<P>
	From the stock market's day-by-day reactions to each statistical  
announcement that comes along, you get an impression of investors 
in a frantic scramble to keep up as the world spins faster and 
faster. 
</P>
<P>
	But if you take a slightly longer perspective, the zigs and zags  
on the charts lose some of their sharp edges, and the game looks a 
little more rational. Instead of an impossible melee, the market 
presents itself as a reasonable, even though absolutely 
unpredictable, place in which to take calculated risks with your 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	As of late last week, the popular stock averages showed  
year-to-date gains of 5 percent to 20 percent, depending on the 
sector of the market they measure. The Dow Jones industrial average 
stood just slightly above where it was two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a very good showing -- double-digit gains all around when  
you project them out to annual rates -- in keeping with an economy 
that still is bursting with signs of vitality. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of June the Federal Reserve may well push short-term  
interest rates higher in an effort to cool down the economy a bit. 
The markets, which always anticipate, seem almost to have worn 
themselves out discounting every possible choice the Fed might 
make, and now stand not far from where they were before the whole 
inflation scare arose. 
</P>
<P>
	It has proved not only futile, but also unnecessary, for  
investors to figure out each twist and turn of the story. 
</P>
<P>
	``How long will the current short-term desire to buy stocks  
last? We have no idea,'' says George Putnam III in his Boston-based 
advisory The Turnaround Letter. ``Given the diversity of the group 
who currently want to buy stocks, it is virtually impossible to 
predict what will make them change their minds and when it will 
happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fortunately for our reputation, we didn't advise anyone to get  
out of stocks two years ago when the Asian crisis broke or last 
summer when Russia's economy imploded. And we are not going to do 
so now, even though we are quite concerned about rising interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Successfully anticipating stock-market movements requires not  
only that you correctly forecast world economic trends and events, 
but also that you predict the reactions of a large and diverse 
group of human beings. We certainly can't do both of those, and we 
don't know anyone who can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once you decide not to try to outguess the economic data or the  
markets, the question naturally arises what you are going to do to 
protect yourself from long bear markets and other calamities. 
</P>
<P>
	The time-honored answer is to diversify, keeping your money  
spread out to minimize the potential damage from disaster in any 
one stock, mutual fund, or market for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Now is a great time, for instance, to have some money in the  
stock market, and some money NOT in the stock market. Also, to keep 
money that is earmarked for interest-bearing securities diversified 
between long-term bonds and the short-term money markets. 
</P>
<P>
	That way your overall portfolio won't be knocked off balance  
whether the Fed tightens credit conditions or not.

<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Helio Castro-Neves knows how to grab the  
lead. Holding onto it, and staying in the race altogether, is 
proving more difficult for the 24-year-old Brazilian. 
</P>
<P>
	Castro-Neves led the first 30 laps of the Budweiser-G.I. Joe's  
200 on Sunday before dropping out because of a blown turbocharger. 
It was the second straight time, and fourth in eight races this 
season, that the second-year CART FedEx Series driver led at least 
part of the way and failed to finish. 
</P>
<P>
	In the season-opener in Homestead, Fla., he finished 17th  
dropping out because of electrical problems. In Nazareth, Pa., he 
started second but finished 21st after a crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago in Milwaukee, Castro-Neves won the pole position  
and had the fastest car early on, but ended up retiring because of 
a turbocharger problem, finishing 26th. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, he appeared in command on Portland International  
Raceway's narrow nine-turn course. After pitting just before the 
31st lap, he was second to Juan Montoya, and the pair were pulling 
away from the pack when Castro-Neves gradually began losing power. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was bad luck,'' he said. ``I was handling it, I was  
saving fuel because I know this race is kind of fuel strategy. The 
car was handling well. What can I say?'' 
</P>
<P>
	After falling into fourth, 16.4 seconds behind Montoya,  
Castro-Neves retired on the 39th lap. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	BAD YEAR ENDS: It was a good day for Goodyear, whose tires held  
out just long enough to carry Gil de Ferran to victory. 
</P>
<P>
	De Farran's win broke a 25-race losing streak by Goodyear dating  
to the 1998 season opener in Homestead. After Michael Andretti won 
that race, drivers rode Firestones to victory in the last 18 races 
of 1998, and the first seven this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Goodyear and I haven't won a race for a couple of years, but  
it was only a matter of time,'' de Ferran said. 
</P>
<P>
	de Ferran tested Goodyears twice on the PIR course, and team  
owner Derrick Walker had confidence on the tires late in the race. 
Running low on fuel and leading by about 29 seconds, the crew took 
just 5.4 seconds to splash some fuel in. The tires stayed on for 
the last 39 laps. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were perfect,'' de Ferran said. ``They had a lot of grip,  
and they were consistent throughout the final run. If they weren't 
consistent, I would never have been able to open up that gap.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	COSTLY DELAY: Despite a stall that cost him more than a minute,  
Michael Andretti fought back for a 10th-place finish, 58.7 seconds 
behind winner Gil de Ferran. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the engine shut down after my first stop, our race was  
pretty much dictated then,'' said Andretti, who picked up five 
points in the PPG Cup standings but dropped from fourth to sixth 
with 64 points. 
</P>
<P>
	On a day in which the main question was whether to pit two or  
three times, Andretti played the fuel conservation game well. On 
the 34th lap, Andretti was the last to pit, and was getting ready 
to challenge the leaders when his wheels spun after refueling. The 
engine stalled, and his crew had to pull the car back to restart 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	When Andretti left pit road, he was next-to-last in 25th place  
before climbing back. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's so disappointing, because it is out of our control,'' he  
said. ``Every other aspect of the race went smoothly. We did 
perfect pit stops and were able to conserve fuel.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	PIT STOPS: Memo Gidley and Gualter Salles made their 1999 CART  
debuts Sunday, and rookie Gidley fared better. Gidley, de Ferran's 
Walker Racing teammate, started 25th in the 28-car field and 
finished 19th. Salles, who recently replaced rookie Alex Barron for 
Dan Gurney's All-American Racing team, had gearbox problems and 
quit after just 10 laps, finishing ahead of only Shigeaki Hattori 
of Japan. ... Following two injuries to pit crew members in the 
last two races, CART officials followed the lead of the crews and 
wore helmets in the pit for the first time. ... Arciero-Wells 
Racing announced it signed rookie driver Cristiano da Matta of 
Brazil through the year 2000. Da Matta finished 11th and stands 
17th in the season points. ... de Ferran finished second twice in 
Portland, including 1996 and 1997, when he lost to Mark Blundell by 
0.027-seconds, the closest finish in CART history.

<HEADLINE> Japan Awaits End to Economic Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- What do you do with an economy when even free money  
fails to generate much excitement? 
</P>
<P>
	That's the dilemma Japan faces.  
</P>
<P>
	Interest rates are so low loans cost next to nothing, yet  
businesses aren't borrowing. The government has handed out billions 
of dollars in free shopping vouchers, but nervous consumers aren't 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``People just put their money in the bank in case the economy  
gets worse,'' said Hanako Hara, a woman selling tickets for the 
national lottery at a downtown booth. ``They're even buying fewer 
lottery tickets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the anniversary of the financial crisis that struck Asia in  
the summer of 1997, there are signs the worst may be over for 
hard-hit countries like South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	But a decade after Japan's ``bubble economy'' of the 1980s began  
to deflate, Japanese leaders are still wondering how to fix it. 
</P>
<P>
	After stumbling along at an average growth rate of just over 1  
percent a year between 1992 and 1997, Japan's economy sank into its 
longest postwar recession, shrinking for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The economy finally grew again in the first quarter of this  
year, expanding a robust 1.9 percent, the government reported June 
10. 
</P>
<P>
	But serious problems remain, analysts warn.  
</P>
<P>
	``At best this is a stabilization, not a recovery,'' said Andrew  
Ballingal, an economist for Schroders Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1980s, clever bureaucrats were credited with  
engineering an economic miracle by focusing resources on strategic 
industries. ``Japan Inc.'' seemed unstoppable, and people were 
confident the good times would never end. 
</P>
<P>
	In the summer of 1989, the benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average  
was soaring toward the 40,000 mark, doubling in just three years. 
Investors seemed to believe it would never stop. 
</P>
<P>
	But as prices spiraled higher, finance officials realized Japan  
was trapped in a speculative bubble. They moved to rein it in by 
tightening credit. 
</P>
<P>
	The brakes grabbed too hard. The Nikkei tumbled 39 percent in  
1990 after peaking at 38,916 at the end of 1989. Land prices sank 
by half or more over the next several years. 
</P>
<P>
	The collapse did damage to corporate balance sheets that lingers  
still, said Richard Koo, an economist at Nomura Research Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	``People said: `It's temporary. In a few years it will go back  
up again.' But once they realized that wasn't going to happen they 
got pretty scared,'' Koo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials have tried a series of measures to ease those fears.  
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan slashed its discount rate -- the rate at which  
it lends to banks -- from 6 percent at the beginning of the decade 
to 0.5 percent in 1995. Then, this March, it pushed a key 
short-term interest rate to zero. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, companies saddled with excess equipment and facilities  
have little need to borrow, and banks are too preoccupied with 
cleaning up bad loans to make new ones. Worries about job losses 
have made consumers reluctant to spend more. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, Japan's jobless rate among men jumped to an all-time  
high of 5 percent, while overall unemployment remained at a record 
4.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has earmarked more than $500 billion in this  
year's budget for tax cuts, spending on roads and bridges and other 
measures intended to stimulate the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The growth spurt in the first quarter was built almost entirely  
on those outlays. 
</P>
<P>
	But economists worry the growth report could make policy makers  
complacent and prompt them to back off on government spending 
before private investment and consumption are strong enough to 
drive growth. 
</P>
<P>
	That has happened before. The economy picked up nicely in 1996,  
but the recovery fizzled after an overly optimistic government 
raised the sales tax in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Other observers worry Japanese leaders aren't addressing the  
economy's worst problems, including the need to simplify 
regulations and create an environment kinder to startup companies. 
</P>
<P>
	A new study even suggests that policies to protect developing  
industries -- the same policies credited for much of Japan Inc.'s 
early success -- have done more harm than good. 
</P>
<P>
	The most competitive industries, such as the video game business  
dominated by Nintendo Co. and Sony Corp., are the ones bureaucrats 
left alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``The single most important lesson for Japan is: Don't mistrust  
competition. Competition is good,'' said Hirotaka Takeuchi, dean of 
Hitotsubashi University's Graduate School of International Strategy 
and one of the study's authors. 
</P>
<P>
	Fixing Japan's problems is crucial. Its economy is bigger than  
all the rest of Asia put together, and economists say the region 
cannot fully recover until Japan is healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless Japan's leaders do something soon, the economy faces ``a  
new negative phase,'' said Ballingal, the Schroders Securities 
economist. 
</P>
<P>
	And, he added, ``What's true for Japan is going to be true for  
all of Asia.''

<HEADLINE> Miami Wins Title With Team Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- This season's Miami team was different from  
those of recent years, and not just because the Hurricanes finally 
won a championship for coach Jim Morris. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, they were better as a unit.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've always said when I've got the team that wins the national  
title, that's going to be my best team. And this team plays 
together the best,'' Morris said after the Hurricanes beat Florida 
State 6-5 for the NCAA championship. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first five seasons at Miami, Morris always brought a  
contender to the College World Series. Those big-hitting teams 
often left disappointed, labeled as underachievers. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 Hurricanes, led by No. 1 draft pick Pat Burrell, set  
school records for homers, RBIs, total bases, runs per game and 
slugging percentage. They left Omaha after scoring eight runs in 
three games. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Miami won its first two CWS games but was eliminated by  
consecutive losses to Alabama, one of the teams the Hurricanes 
already had beaten. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there was the haunting end to the 1996 season. Miami was  
one out from the national title when LSU's Warren Morris lifted the 
Tigers to a 9-8 victory with a ninth-inning homer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think people can understand how traumatic that was to  
our team and our coaches,'' the Miami coach said. ``It was 
crushing, just crushing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, in his sixth year, Morris got his title, the school's  
third. And it was a scrappy team that won it, surviving injuries, 
winning with singles and bunts and getting outstanding pitching. 
</P>
<P>
	``Growing up in Miami, I remember how it felt in 1996 just being  
a fan,'' outfielder Manny Crespo said. ``I remember '97 and last 
year, when we came here and failed to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year, we just had guys keep stepping up and battling and  
pulling off wins. We had so many guys do it. I've never seen a team 
play as tight as we did this year,'' Crespo said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, the biggest contributor was Kevin Brown. He homered  
in the second to tie it 2-2 and hit a three-run double in Miami's 
five-run fifth to put the Hurricanes ahead for good. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought the home run was huge because it tied the game and  
got us going,'' Morris said. ``All of Kevin's home runs have been 
big this year, whether here, in the regional or super regional.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Closer Michael Neu threw the last two innings for his 16th save,  
retiring the side in the ninth and striking out Kevin Cash to end 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, with the Hurricanes one pitch from victory, Morris  
couldn't help thinking about what happened three years ago. This 
time, Neu made sure the ball didn't land in the outfield bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mike made a tremendous pitch, a great curveball that was  
impossible to take but impossible to hit,'' Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
	It capped a season of challenges for the Hurricanes.  
</P>
<P>
	Catcher Russ Jacobsen, a third-round pick by the Philadelphia  
Phillies, saw his season end in May with a forearm injury. Four 
pitchers, including staff ace Alex Santos, sat out various spans 
with injuries. So did Crespo, third baseman Lale Esquivel and 
outfielder Mike Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
	That didn't stop Miami, which won its last 11 games.  
</P>
<P>
	``The way this team is, we knew we had to get good pitching and  
play good defense, and we made the plays when it counted,'' Morris 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami's victory ended a four-week tournament that went almost  
exactly as the NCAA selection committee had scripted. With the 
brackets expanded to 64 teams, seven of the eight top-seeded 
schools advanced to Omaha and the top two teams played for the 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	It also concluded a season in which teams played with modified  
aluminum bats. They were scaled down last year by the NCAA amid 
concerns for player safety and the game's integrity following USC's 
21-14 championship victory. 
</P>
<P>
	In this year's CWS, an NCAA panel continued its momentum on the  
issue by recommending that manufacturers make the metal bats 
perform as much as possible like wooden bats. A decision is 
expected this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Another announcement was warmly received by fans, coaches, and  
players. The NCAA and city officials have a preliminary agreement 
to keep the tournament in Omaha through 2005, with a five-year 
option after that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't imagine the College World Series being anywhere other  
than Omaha,'' Morris said. ``No one in the whole nation could do 
what they do here.''

<HEADLINE> Gulf War Syndrome Studied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Soldiers born with low levels of an enzyme that  
helps the body fight off chemical toxins are more likely to report 
symptoms of Gulf War syndrome than soldiers born with normal 
levels, a new study has found. 
</P>
<P>
	The authors say the small-scale study of 46 Gulf War veterans is  
the first to suggest a genetic marker to explain why some soldiers 
got sick from possible exposure to toxic nerve agents, possibly in 
combination with pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of veterans returned from the 1990-91 ground war in  
the Middle East complaining of chronic, unexplained health woes. 
The veterans said they are experiencing confusion, memory loss and 
balance problems. Others said they have pain in their neck, 
shoulders and hips, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we know that there's a genetic reason why some of these  
guys got sick and others didn't,'' said Dr. Robert Haley, the chief 
of epidemiology at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical 
Center in Dallas and the study's author. 
</P>
<P>
	His findings, which appeared in the June 16 issue of Toxicology  
and Applied Pharmacology, are based on a larger 1997 study of a 
Naval Mobile Construction Battalion, or Seabees. 
</P>
<P>
	Haley, with assistance from Dr. Bert La Du and Scott Billecke  
from the University of Michigan Medical School, investigated how 
the Seabees' genes produced an enzyme in their bodies that 
naturally protect them from toxins. Those born with low levels of 
the protective enzyme -- called type Q paraoxonase, or PON-Q -- were 
the ones who reportedly got sick. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-one of the 26 sick Seabees in the study had below average  
or extremely low PON-Q levels in their blood. Haley said the enzyme 
levels are constant throughout a person's life and likely wouldn't 
be lowered because of illness. 
</P>
<P>
	``The PON gene is a good candidate'' for signaling neurological  
damage resulting from chemical or nerve gas exposure, said Dr. 
Simon Wessely, a Gulf War researcher at King's College at the 
University of London, who was not involved with the study. ``But 
any findings like this must be regarded as preliminary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haley agreed, calling his findings a ``highly refined  
hypothesis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We spent $3 million on these 46 guys and so we've been able to  
measure the things that are likely to be the cause of their 
illness,'' Haley said. ``Now it's time to move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Defense and the Perot Foundation provided  
funding for the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Haley and Wessely both noted that larger studies are under way  
to examine the link between PON levels and war-related illness. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 697,000 Americans served in the Gulf War that  
succeeded in driving Iraqi forces out of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
	Sick veterans suggest they were exposed to chemical pollutants  
from burning oil fields, insecticides or inoculations to protect 
them from germ warfare. They also say they were possibly exposed to 
Iraqi chemical or biological weapons, infectious diseases and 
depleted uranium used in artillery shells. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon asserts there's no conclusive evidence to support  
those claims but says it has not ruled out chemical or 
environmental explanations and continues to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, a large study of British troops found that soldiers  
who served in the Gulf War do have a rate of general ill health -- 
at least two times as high as troops who went to Bosnia and 
soldiers who stayed home. 
</P>
<P>
	But that study by Wessely and others cautioned that there was no  
single ``syndrome'' among the ill soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Haley's previous research on a small number of patients  
concluded that some Gulf War veterans suffer from distinct symptom 
clusters caused by chemical poisoning and that some may have 
suffered neurological damage from nerve gas or pesticides.

<HEADLINE> An American Portrait of Columnist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- His mom cried when she found out. His  
dad, he was just a little embarrassed. Their only son, the aspiring 
journalist, had started his newspaper's ... body-piercing beat? 
</P>
<P>
	The Daily Collegian, Penn State's student daily, put it in  
loftier terms: ``Every week, James Conroy gets part of his body 
pierced and records the experience for posterity and the good of 
mankind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conroy, 21, started with his tongue and proceeded to his ear  
(twice), his chin, his nose, his navel, his nipple -- and yes, even 
that place, as he called it, ``down south.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It had to be done,'' Conroy insists.  
</P>
<P>
	Along the way, he gathered some attention on campus: quotes in  
The Chronicle of Higher Education, photos with female fans at a 
party, an appearance on the Internet wearing only a ``censored'' 
box. 
</P>
<P>
	Plus dozens of e-mails each day from readers suggesting which  
body part to pierce next. Some wanted him to go for the back of his 
neck. Others targeted the webbing between thumb and index finger. 
And, of course... 
</P>
<P>
	``As the saying goes, `Never say never,''' Conroy wrote in his  
column, ``James' Adventures in ... Piercing,'' after waffling for 
weeks about whether to go below the belt. ``If I hadn't done it,'' 
he says now, ``there would have been 40,000 people, theoretically, 
berating me for being a wimp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conroy, of Aston, Pa., claims to be normal, citing as evidence  
his conservative taste in fashion and his education at an all-boys' 
Catholic high school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't come across as an outlandish guy,'' Conroy says. ``If  
you saw me now, you wouldn't even be able to see any of the 
piercings. Once I know people, they see I'm pretty nutty, but I 
don't come across that way to random people on the street.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he had pierced his tongue and eyebrow before, so his editor,  
Jason Fagone, labeled him adventurous. 
</P>
<P>
	The real adventure didn't start until the column's third week,  
when Conroy went for the relatively exotic skin between bottom lip 
and chin. ``The weather was crisp and there was that 
get-a-big-needle-shoved-through-your-lip feeling in the air,'' he 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	After the needle came out and the hardware screwed in, Conroy  
started to feel funky. The piercer's voice had changed. ``He was 
sounding like Charlie Brown's teacher: `Wha wha-wha-wha wha wha,''' 
he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	After drinking loads of Gatorade, Conroy sat down to write and  
doled out one bit of advice: Eat before the pain rushes in. Then he 
developed the Conroy Scale, a pain-o-meter recording 1-to-10. 
</P>
<P>
	The worst of the nine piercings? The nipple.  
</P>
<P>
	The easiest? The tongue. (No nerves down the middle of the  
tongue, he reports.) 
</P>
<P>
	The bloodiest? A barbell at the top of his ear that requires two  
holes. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest problem? The folks who pay his tuition.  
</P>
<P>
	His parents called one Thursday to say they planned to drive in  
-- that weekend. First he spent two hours trying to extricate 
himself from his newest piercing. Then he flipped out, rushed back 
to the piercer and begged him to pull out the chin stud. He did, 
but Conroy still couldn't remove the eyebrow hoop. 
</P>
<P>
	Mom, still in the family's Mercury Sable: ``Take that out.''  
</P>
<P>
	Conroy: ``I've been trying all morning.''  
</P>
<P>
	She wasn't the only person upset. One girl growled at him. One  
reader hoped the next hole in Conroy's body would be ``a .357 
projectile piercing James' temple.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people in the piercing scene hate his guts,'' reports  
Michael Dameron, owner of Forbidden Fruit and the man responsible 
for most of Conroy's holes. ``He reduced it to an MTV-generation 
fad. It really goes a lot deeper than that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Conroy has his fans. One girl asked him out in an e-mail.  
(He passed.) When he contemplated stopping in March, several 
e-mailers urged him to keep going. That kind of response helped him 
through the rough times. ``It's painful,'' he admits. ``It really 
is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some piercings have already disappeared. One fell out, and he  
took out a couple that annoyed him. Two others were victims of his 
summer sojourn home, where neither his mother nor his construction 
job would tolerate the metal baubles. Only three remain -- all of 
them out of sight, usually. 
</P>
<P>
	For pain and suffering, Conroy won a statewide award for best  
collegiate column and may win a journalism scholarship. And his 
hopes for next school year are high: perhaps another stint as a 
columnist or music writer. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper fared well, too. By semester's end, more students  
seemed to be reading the Arts section, and editor Fagone called 
Conroy's column the section's best journalism. 
</P>
<P>
	Forget the question of taste, says Fagone. ``It's fun to get a  
reaction.''

	LAUREL, Mont. (AP) -- Robert C. Guthrie, who helped develop pulse  
radar, died Monday. He was 93. 
</P>
<P>
	Guthrie's long career at the Naval Research Laboratory in  
Washington included a key role in the development of pulse radar.

<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Former vice president Kamal El-Din Hussein,  
one of the army officers who helped Gamal Abdel Nasser topple 
Egypt's monarchy in 1952, died Saturday after a long illness and 
complications from liver cancer. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
	Hussein joined Nasser in the ``Free Officers'' movement during  
the 1948 war with Israel. When the officers overthrew Egypt's King 
Farouq four years later, he became a member of the ruling 
Revolution Council and minister of social affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	He later was named one of Nasser's deputies and headed the  
National Guard during the 1956 war against Britain and France 
following Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal. 
</P>
<P>
	Hussein fell out with Nasser when he opposed many of the late  
president's policies, especially his heavy-handed style of 
government and favoritism, which he blamed for Egypt's defeat in 
the 1967 war with Israel.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Douglas Seale, a British actor, director and  
producer whose career was marked by six decades of stage, screen 
and television, died June 13. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Seale was stage-trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and  
made his debut in 1934 in ``The Drums Begin'' in London. Over the 
next 60 years he acted in scores of stage productions in Britain, 
the United States, Canada and Ireland, and directed or produced 
numerous plays, specializing in Shakespeare. His theater career was 
interrupted by six years of British army duty during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	He was best known here for his role as a drunken actor in the  
1983 Broadway production of Michael Frayn's comedy, ``Noises Off,'' 
for which he won a Tony nomination, and made his last appearance as 
an aging vaudevillian in a 1996 revival of John Osborne's ``The 
Entertainer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seale's film credits included ``Amadeus,'' 1983; ``Heaven Help  
Us,'' 1984; ``I'm No Angel,'' 1990, and ``Aladdin'' (as the 
Sultan's voice), 1992, and ``For Love or Money,'' 1992. On 
television he appeared in ``The Lucie Arnaz Show,'' ``Amazing 
Stories,'' ``Cheers'' and ``Rags to Riches.''

 *Mario Soldati    	
</P>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Mario Soldati, a film director and prolific writer  
of books, poems and screenplays, died Saturday. He was 92. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he directed some 30 films from 1931 to 1960, his  
strongest talent was considered his narrative style of writing. He 
often delved into the whimsical strangeness of life in some three 
dozen works. 
</P>
<P>
	His novels won occasional Italian literary prizes, but had  
little commercial success. 
</P>
<P>
	His first widely recognized book was ``Lettere da Capri,''  
written in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
	He adapted easily to television, working with the medium in the  
early 1950s in its very first years in Italy. He was also 
considered the father of Italian TV criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the more acclaimed of his films was ``Piccolo Mondo  
Antico,'' and ``La Provinciale,'' based on a novel by Alberto 
Moravia.

<HEADLINE> Blues Get Goalie Turek From Stars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The St. Louis Blues acquired Dallas Stars  
backup goalie Roman Turek on Sunday in hopes he'll challenge 
37-year-old Grant Fuhr for the starting job. 
</P>
<P>
	Turek, 29, the backup to Ed Belfour in Dallas, cost the Blues a  
third-round pick in the Entry Draft. He was 16-3-3 with one shutout 
and a 2.02 goals-against average last season for the Stanley Cup 
champions and tied for 10th in the NHL with a .925 save percentage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe Roman has the ability and character to be a No. 1  
goaltender, and he'll get the chance to prove that,'' general 
manager Larry Pleau said. ``Roman should be an excellent fit for 
our club. 
</P>
<P>
	``His experience playing for a Stanley Cup champion should  
benefit us next season and into the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fuhr likely will be exposed in the expansion draft on Friday.  
Pleau said he'd only protect one goalie when he submitted his list 
Monday, but wouldn't say which one. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuhr, who makes $3 million, said he would understand the tactic.  
In the middle of last season, he announced plans to retire at the 
end of next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Old, high salary, I'd say I'm pretty safe,'' Fuhr said.  
</P>
<P>
	Whatever happens, Pleau said Fuhr has always carried too much of  
the load in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right from the start, we never expected him to play 50-60-70  
games,'' Pleau said. ``We've been looking for a goaltender to take 
the opportunity and run with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues used five goaltenders last season, with many of them  
receiving auditions when Fuhr was out with a knee injury. Jamie 
McLennan was the backup most of last season and the team also used 
rookie Brent Johnson, Rich Parent and Jim Carey. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a load of goalies right now,'' Pleau said. ``We'll  
see what happens the rest of the summer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Down the line, Pleau believes Johnson, 21, has the ability to be  
the starter. But Johnson likely will play with Worcester of the 
American Hockey League next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel he's got a bright future,'' Pleau said. ``We also feel  
it's important to give him that extra development time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turek made his NHL debut in 1996-97 with the Stars, going 3-1  
with a 2.05 goals-against average. The following season he was 
11-10-1 with a 2.22 goals-against and one shutout. 
</P>
<P>
	He also was a member of the Czech Republic team that won the  
World Cup in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Pawnshop Target of Fed Gun Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UPPER DARBY, Pa. (AP) -- Three, maybe four times each month, one  
suburban pawnshop on the rough edge of Philadelphia takes a phone 
call asking it to trace a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	The caller -- the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms  
-- won't say whether the weapon has been stolen, abandoned, or 
worse. Just as the ATF won't say now whether Lou's Loan, a bustling 
little shop, is among the tiny percentage of the nation's gun 
dealers recently cited as the source of a large percentage of 
weapons linked to criminal activity. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, released June 7 by Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.,  
blames 1 percent of the more than 100,000 federally licensed gun 
dealers for nearly half of the crime guns the ATF traced last year. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1996 through 1998, some 34,000 guns used in crimes were  
traced to just over one-tenth of 1 percent of those dealers. The 
report calls these 137 dealers ``bad apples'' and notes that 23 
have already lost their licenses or otherwise quit the business. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the ATF provided statistics on traces for the report, the  
agency doesn't name names of specific dealers, only of the 
communities, such as Upper Darby, where they operate. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the town of 83,000 people, and only a handful of gun  
dealers, Upper Darby police say it must be Lou's. ``A lot of 
weapons have been sold out of Lou's,'' says Detective Sgt. George 
Rhoades. 
</P>
<P>
	Lou's owner, Stanton Myerson, is also sure that his store is on  
Schumer's list. After all, he boasts, his shop sells a lot of guns. 
And, though Myerson refuses to disclose how many, he objects that 
the report fails to take sales volume into account. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a fraction of his firearms fall into criminal hands,  
Myerson insists. And typically, crime guns are stolen from a 
customer or are part of an illegal ``straw purchase,'' in which the 
buyer secretly plans to give the gun away. As Myerson points out, 
if someone is intent on doing harm, ``there's always a way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From all appearances and by all accounts, Lou's avoids the  
pawnshop stereotype of seamy retailing. Its displays are spotless; 
signs declare the need for a records check. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities give Lou's high marks for obeying state and federal  
gun laws. ``If Lou's was doing anything illegal, they'd be shut 
down,'' says Upper Darby police Capt. Rudy D'Alesio, ``and if the 
ATF didn't do it, we would.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Often the staff at Lou's assist police. With Dennis Wilson's  
help, Duan Seay is heading for old age in prison. Once a regular at 
Lou's, Seay was always browsing, never buying. But his girlfriend 
bought a TEC DC-9, a semiautomatic assault pistol. It jammed and, 
though she returned it for repairs, it was Seay who kept pestering: 
Was it fixed yet? 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson, Lou's best gun dealer, remembered all this one morning  
in 1997 when a broadcast described a holdup that turned into a 
high-speed chase. Two gunmen traded shots with a police officer and 
a stray bullet struck an 8-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I happened to see this guy's face on the TV,'' Wilson recalls.  
He pored through records, got the girlfriend's address and called 
the police who arrested Seay. Last year, Seay was sentenced to a 
minimum of 26 1/2 years in prison on robbery, weapons and conspiracy 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philadelphia Inquirer last year reported that the ATF traced  
111 crime guns to Lou's between January 1995 and December 1997, an 
average of more than three a month. The ATF will not confirm 
crime-gun traces to Lou's, or any other dealer. Jeffrey Roehm, at 
ATF headquarters in Washington, calls that information ``strictly 
raw data'' -- and no evidence of criminal activity. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency pursues such evidence anywhere it can. An ATF poster  
urges riders taking the 15-minute trip from Philadelphia to Upper 
Darby to report illegal weapons. ``Call 800-ATF-GUNS,'' the 
black-and-white ad pleads. ``We are making a federal case out of 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pitch seems aimed at city dwellers, not residents of Upper  
Darby. Once past the grittiness of its shopping district, the 
community looks largely middle-class and prosperous. Tidy apartment 
complexes and sturdy houses of brick and stone line streets shaded 
by trees. 
</P>
<P>
	Lou's is a few steps from the train station. The shop is one of  
five operating in Pennsylvania and Delaware. The owner's father, 
Louis, founded the first in 1921. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucked under a yellow awning and between a wig shop and a  
jeweler, Lou's storefront displays audio headsets and household 
wares. Signs advertise money orders and check cashing, not guns. 
Myerson says he relies on word of mouth, and ads in the Yellow 
Pages. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside, customers find floor-to-ceiling enticements: a cash  
machine and conga drums, guitars and violins, microwave ovens and 
used power tools. Objects in hock are downstairs, out of sight. 
</P>
<P>
	Most days, Wilson says, buyers stand three deep and five across.  
They come mainly for the guns -- in all, about 125 long guns and 250 
handguns. 
</P>
<P>
	Against a wall, near the back, are racks of rifles priced from  
$300 to $1,200. Most are for hunting, but Lou's also sells 
military-style weapons such as the Colt AR-15 assault rifles that 
buyers like as investments. 
</P>
<P>
	Handguns fill three long glass cases. Propped on green and red  
felt, they cost from $180 to $750. A snapshot of Charlton Heston, 
president of the National Rifle Association, hovers above. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson, like his boss, is a member, and he echoes the group's  
stance on control. ``This gun won't do anything unless this,'' 
Wilson says, pointing to his head, ``makes it do something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet when he learns that a weapon that crossed his counter  
surfaces in a crime, he says: ``We shouldn't be surprised, but I 
always am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson does what he can to prevent such surprises. He advises  
customers to practice at a firing range, and he instructs them 
on-the-spot in handling and safety. 
</P>
<P>
	He also follows gut instincts. ``I can stop any one I choose,''  
he says. ``If I suspect them in any way, I will deny them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If they appear drugged? Or drunk? Tipsy or irate? ``I won't  
sell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Come back when you're feeling better,'' he tells them. And, if  
they do come back, still no sale. 
</P>
<P>
	State and federal law allows anyone over 18 without a felony  
record to buy a rifle, but Wilson, the father of a teen-age boy, 
enforces ``our policy.'' Even 18-year-olds aren't allowed to shop 
at Lou's on school days. 
</P>
<P>
	Pennsylvania puts no limit on the number of guns purchased at  
one time, but Wilson restricts sales to two. And anyone who wants 
two gets stern talk. ``If they're not for you,'' he warns, ``you 
will go to jail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, efforts fail.  
</P>
<P>
	Store manager Charlene Powery tells of a customer in his 70s who  
wanted a downstairs gun for protection, as backup for the one he 
already kept upstairs. After a records check, she sold him a 
handgun. 
</P>
<P>
	Not long after, a woman stormed in, yelling ``murderer!'' and  
waving paperwork on a gun from Lou's. The buyer had delivered the 
gun to a friend dying of cancer, and he used it to kill himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could not sleep for almost a week,'' Ms. Powery recalls.  
``Did you miss something? Did you pay attention? You go over the 
steps, but all your steps are legal.''

<HEADLINE> Australia Wins World Cricket Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Australia won cricket's World Cup for the second  
time Sunday with an emphatic victory over Pakistan at Lord's. 
</P>
<P>
	The winning margin of eight wickets was a World Cup finals  
record, one more than Sri Lanka had in 1996 against Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia, led by captain Steve Waugh, captured its first World  
Cup in 1987. Waugh and Tom Moody are the only remaining members of 
that championship team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Earlier in the tournament we were not doing ourselves  
justice,'' said Waugh, who is 34 and probably played his last World 
Cup. ``I knew we had a good enough side, a side good as any in the 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``We scrambled out way through. We had a bit of luck on the way.  
For me this is the best win of my career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Australians proved resilient throughout the 42-game  
tournament. They fought their way back from the brink of 
elimination when it lost to Pakistan by 10 runs at Headingley on 
May 23. This time, Pakistan appeared tense and overmatched. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were beaten by a better side,'' Pakistan's Wasim Akram  
said. ``They showed their class today. They showed they are the 
best side in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not disappointed in any way. We qualified for the final  
with a very young side. We've got a very bright future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shane Warne, who bowled Australia to a tie in the semifinal  
against South Africa, starred again. His efforts put him on par 
with New Zealand's Geoff Allott as the leading wicket taker with 20 
apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was tough all the way,'' Waugh said. ``I thought the  
defining moment for us was the semifinal, but you've still got to 
make it happen on the day.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	There was no record crowd Sunday for the Women's World Cup  
doubleheader at Foxboro Stadium. Of course, there was no scheduled 
appearance by the U.S. team, either. 
</P>
<P>
	The attendance at Foxboro was 14,873, with a walk-up sale of  
1,292 on gameday. The crowd came to see Australia-Ghana and 
Norway-Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers were encouraged, considering that the Red Sox were at  
home, the U.S. Open was on television and it was a nice day for the 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it's a very solid crowd for the second day of the  
tournament, the first day of the tournament here at Foxboro with 
four teams that don't really have a very strong fan base in the 
area,'' said Richard Finn, Women's World Cup director of public 
reltations. ``We think it's nothing to be disappointed with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also noted that the total crowd for Saturday in San Jose and  
the Meadowlands and today at Foxboro came to 117,143, more than the 
estimated 112,000 who attended the entire 1995 Women's World Cup in 
Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SEEING RED:* Ghana received four yellow cards and a red card in  
its 1-1 tie with Australia, which got just one yellow card. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot comment on the refereeing, but I thought that the  
slightest attention drew a card,'' Ghana coach Emmanuel Afranie 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ghana played with 10 players after losing Barikiso Tettey-Quao  
to the first red card of the tournament in the 25th minute when she 
tackled Joanne Peters from behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ghana is noted for that type of play,'' Australia goalie  
Tracey Wheeler said. ``It reminded me of the men's World Cup. I 
think the red card set a standard for how this tournament will be 
played.'' 
</P>
<P>
	FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper stressed before the tournament that  
the organization would make it clear to the teams that referees 
will not allow excessive physical activity. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HAT TRICKS:* When Brazil's Sissi scored her third goal of  
Saturday's rout of Mexico, teammate Pretinha knew what she had to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got my third goal because I was jealous that Sissi scored  
three,'' Pretinha said with a laugh after the 7-1 victory in the 
World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Pretinha, a diminutive forward with an exceptional burst to the  
ball, scored early and late. She needed only 2 minutes, 10 seconds 
to get her first and had her second through 12 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	But then Sissi got her hat trick, including two on free kicks.  
</P>
<P>
	In the 90th minute, however, Pretinha got her head on a cross  
for her third score. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was thinking that I had to get three to match Sissi,'' she  
said. ``I was very fortunate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pretinha and Sissi got their hat tricks at Giants Stadium in  
front of the greatest of all Brazilian players, Pele, who was in 
the stands. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SURPRISE GOALIE:* Australia's Tracey Wheeler found out just  
Sunday morning she would be the starting goalkeeper against Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Belinda Kitching played in the last three games of the Oceania  
World Cup qualifying tournament last October and all three in the 
Australia Cup in January. Australia won five of those games and 
tied one. But Wheeler, 31, is more experienced, having played three 
games -- all losses -- in the 1995 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Greg Brown said ``both goalies played two games each (in  
tuneups for the tournament). Kitching also had a sore hand. Wheeler 
did an all right job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a surprise for me to start,'' Wheeler said after the  
1-1 tie. ``Up until a few months ago I was the No. 3 goalkeeper on 
the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *TEEN TEAM:* It might have been beaten 7-1 by Brazil on  
Saturday, but the Mexican team still has its future ahead of it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mexican girls can still dream of World Cups to come. Of the  
Mexican starters, only Andrea Rodebaugh is over 22. Four of the 
starters are teen-agers and a total of seven are 20 or under. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's team is older and much more experienced: the star  
scorers are Sissi (32) and Pretinha (23).

<P>
	LONG POND, Pa. (AP) -- Two was an unlucky number for Jeff Burton  
at the Pocono 500 on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's my fault,'' Burton said of a second-lap crash that  
relegated him to a 36th-place finish. ``It's not the guy in front's 
fault, it's the guy in back's fault.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burton collided with Wally Dallenbach after the cars exited the  
sharp tunnel turn at Pocono International Raceway. The crash cost 
him second place in the Winston Cup points race. 
</P>
<P>
	He fell behind race winner Bobby Labonte, and now trails leader  
Dale Jarrett by 186 points after 15 of 34 races. 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte moved within 89 points of Jarrett.  
</P>
<P>
	Burton, whose three victories this year tie him with defending  
series champion Jeff Gordon, apologized for his mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wasn't anticipating him to get out of the gas and I ran  
into him,'' Burton said of Dallenbach, Gordon's teammate. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SPENCER'S DAY:* Mr. Excitement nearly lived up to his nickname.  
</P>
<P>
	Jimmy Spencer, from nearby Berwick, Pa., was strong late in the  
race as he tried to win for the first time in nearly five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Spencer, who led 14 laps, was especially impressive because he  
made up a lap lost earlier in the race because of a loose lug nut. 
He finished 14th. 
</P>
<P>
	``I realized I had some of the best drivers in the world to  
beat, and they were right behind me,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spencer's undoing came when he hit some oil while trying to hold  
off Jeff Gordon, Mark Martin, Dale Jarrett and eventual winner 
Bobby Labonte. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I had a chance,'' Spencer said.  
</P>
<P>
	The run was one of the most impressive since he won in 1994 in  
Talladega, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	Spencer reportedly is seeking another ride next year. His  
sponsor, Winston, has announced it will not return to back the 
effort of car owner Travis Carter. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WALLACE'S HOOD:* The new hood restraint NASCAR is trying out on  
selected cars got an early test Sunday when Rusty Wallace's car 
slammed into the wall on lap 7. The device seemed to work. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace's Ford blew its right front tire before going into the  
wall on the first turn, smashing the right side of the car. 
</P>

	Wallace was not hurt, but called it ``one of the hardest hits  
I've ever had in my life.'' He left the race after the crash.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wants Tougher Gun Show Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite a major defeat in the House last week,  
there's still some hope that House and Senate negotiators will 
include meaningful gun control measures in a juvenile crime bill, 
Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle says. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton continued to press the House to reverse its  
position and accept tougher controls on sales at gun shows. But 
Democrats were also looking beyond the vote to how the gun control 
issue could play for them in next year's election. 
</P>
<P>
	House Democrats last week led the effort to defeat the gun  
control portion of a juvenile crime package after Republicans 
pushed through a provision, written by Democratic Rep. John Dingell 
of Michigan and backed by the National Rifle Association, that 
Democrats charged would make gun-show background checks 
ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate version includes the background check and other gun  
control measures, and could still be included in the final package, 
although Republicans control both the House and Senate negotiating 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still have some hope,'' Daschle, D-S.D., said Sunday on  
CBS' ``Face the Nation.'' ``We're going to fight as hard as we 
possibly can to ensure that they are included in a final bill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, a fierce opponent of  
gun control, said the House-passed measure, which responds to the 
spate of shootings in American schools by imposing tougher 
penalties for youth crimes and encouraging character-building in 
schools, was a ``wonderful bill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Democrats, in order to score political points, rejected  
the legislation even though it would have required gun 
manufacturers to include safety locks, banned some ammunition clips 
and made it unlawful for children under 18 to possess assault 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	DeLay, appearing on ABC's ``This Week,'' said the 24 hours  
allowed for background checks in the House bill, instead of the 
three days in the Senate bill, was sufficient, particularly if the 
FBI agreed to stay open on weekends, when most gun shows are held. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did what I thought was right,'' said Dingell, the senior  
House Democrat who has long had close ties to the NRA. ``If you 
really want to deal with the problem of kids I don't think it 
begins with harassing law-abiding citizens,'' he said on ``Fox News 
Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dingell said he thought it was a ``distinct possibility'' that  
the final House-Senate bill would have some gun control language. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration argues that while instant checks can be used  
in most cases, there should be a waiting period when such checks 
can't be done, as in the case with the Brady law enacted for gun 
store handgun purchases in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, interviewed on CNN, said the Brady law has blocked  
400,000 unqualified buyers from getting guns. ``Do I think violent 
crime would go down any more'' by closing the gun show loopholes? 
``Absolutely I do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri told ABC that  
the gun issue could work to his party's advantage next year. 
</P>
<P>
	He said a small part of the electorate probably were  
single-interest voters who would oppose gun control advocates. 
``The problem is the 80 percent who are for gun safety just aren't 
for it very much, they are not intense,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Appealing to this majority is crucial, Gephardt said, because  
gun control ``can be run on and it can be won on in any district in 
this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Dingell said support for the Brady law and other gun-control  
legislation hurt Democrats in some districts around the country in 
1994 and ``probably did cost us (control of) the Congress.''

<HEADLINE> Stephen King Alert After Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEWISTON, Maine (AP) -- Stephen King was alert and in good  
spirits Sunday after surgery for injuries suffered when he was 
struck by a van while walking along a rural Maine highway. 
</P>
<P>
	The prolific best-selling horror author remained in serious but  
stable condition, and faces additional surgery this week, said 
Chuck Gill, a spokesman for Central Maine Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said King was thrown 14 feet when he was hit Saturday  
by a Dodge Caravan in rural Lovell, where he owns a summer home. 
</P>
<P>
	Chip Baker, who witnessed the accident, told WCSH-TV in Portland  
that he rushed to help King. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was bleeding and he was laying in a heap and all tangled  
up,'' Baker said. ``It just happened so quick, you know. I knew he 
was in kind of rough shape in either his leg or his hip.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gill said King suffered a collapsed lung and multiple fractures  
of the right leg and hip. He was also treated during surgery at 
around 3:30 a.m. for a scalp laceration. 
</P>
<P>
	King was conscious and alert after he emerged from the  
operation. His wife, Tabitha, his children and other relatives were 
by King's side. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been alert and he's in pretty good spirits,'' Gill said.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Sunday, hospital spokesman Laird Covey said King had  
been talking with his wife, adding, ``I know that he has been 
cracking some jokes to the staff about his condition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King was walking south on the shoulder of state Route 5 at about  
4:30 p.m. Saturday when a motorist approaching from behind lost 
control of his vehicle because of a dog that was loose inside, 
Oxford County Sheriff's deputy Matt Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to witnesses, the driver, Bryan Smith, 41, did not  
appear to be speeding, Baker said. He said no charges will be filed 
against Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	King, who lives in Bangor, may have been on one of his daily  
long walks at his summer home when he was struck, Covey said. 
Lovell is about 115 miles southwest of Bangor. 
</P>
<P>
	King has written more than two dozen novels, including ``The  
Shining,'' ``Carrie'' and ``Pet Sematary.'' King's ``The Girl Who 
Loved Tom Gordon'' is on several best seller lists this weekend.

<HEADLINE> Schools Seek Ways To Lure Teachers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's schools, relying more and more on  
uncertified instructors, are having a tough time recruiting 
teachers these days because of competition from higher-paying 
industries more attractive to college graduates. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey released today by the American Federation of Teachers  
found that beginning teachers made $25,735 on average in 1997-98, 
compared with $42,862 for new engineering graduates and $40,920 for 
new computer scientists. 
</P>
<P>
	The national average salary for all teachers in the 1997-98  
school year was $39,347, according to the union. In other 
professional fields, lawyers earned $71,530, engineers made $64,489 
and computer systems analysts drew an average paycheck of $63,072. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teaching is enormously gratifying, and many more would make it  
their career choice if they felt they were treated like 
professionals,'' said Sandra Feldman, president of the country's 
second-largest teachers union. 
</P>
<P>
	Feldman said districts wanting to attract and retain teachers  
must also reduce class sizes, enforce strict discipline policies, 
modernize school buildings and make other improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	Districts have begun offering signing bonuses and housing  
allowances, as well as issuing emergency teaching credentials, the 
survey found. It said 8.5 percent of teachers taught under 
temporary or emergency credentials in 1998-99, up from 8 percent in 
1997-98. 
</P>
<P>
	The AFT and the Clinton administration have pushed states and  
districts to end emergency teacher credentials. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has proposed that within four years, 95  
percent of all teachers in a state would have to be fully certified 
or working toward obtaining certification within three years. 
</P>
<P>
	The salary reports comes as the Education Department estimates  
schools will need to hire 2.2 million teachers over the next 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The union also surveyed personnel officers in the nation's 200  
largest school districts, and found that low salaries, an aging 
teacher force and rising enrollments were the leading reasons for 
the teacher shortage. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials reported teacher shortages, especially in large  
urban districts. More than two-thirds of respondents said they did 
not have enough teacher applicants for the 1998-99 school year. 
</P>
<P>
	The school officials who hire teachers also said that districts  
had more trouble this year than four years ago in attracting 
qualified teachers. Shortages were most severe for special 
education, math and bilingual instructors. 
</P>
<P>
	The five states with the highest average teacher salaries were  
Connecticut ($51,727), New Jersey ($50,284), New York ($48,712), 
Michigan ($48,361) and Alaska ($48,275). 
</P>
<P>
	The bottom five states in 1997-98 were New Mexico ($30,309),  
Louisiana ($30,090), Mississippi ($28,691), North Dakota ($28,231) 
and South Dakota ($27,839). 
</P>
<P>
	Sources for the union's report included state education  
departments and the Education Department's survey of teacher 
salaries.

<HEADLINE> Daly Walks Away From U.S. Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- John Daly didn't walk off the course  
after his 11 on the eighth hole. Instead, he'll walk away from the 
U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not worth it. This is my last U.S. Open -- ever,'' Daly  
said Sunday as he walked to his car after an 83 that left him in 
last place at 29-over-par among those who made the cut. ``I've had 
it with the USGA and the way they run their tournaments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daly, who battles alcoholism and a gambling problem, shot a  
first-round 68 and trailed the leaders by one shot. Things then 
fell apart for the game's longest hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly said he loved Pinehurst No. 2 after his 2-under round  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard, very hard, but .... you don't have to sit there and  
hit 2- and 3-irons off every tee like most U.S. Opens. I think it's 
a fun golf course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He changed his tune Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	Daly's 11 on the par-4, 485-yard hole was the highest score on  
any hole in the four-day tournament. He finished the front nine 
with an 11-over 46. 
</P>
<P>
	``The USGA loves to embarrass guys who play in their  
tournaments,'' said Daly, a former PGA and British Open champion. 
``I don't mind hitting the ball bad, but when I feel like I've hit 
the ball pretty good for four days and shoot an 81, it's not golf. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's crazy. My hat's off to whoever wins, and it's a major,  
but ... I don't consider the U.S. Open a major anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Golf Association said the course was fair.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry John feels that way,'' said Marty Parkes, USGA  
senior director of communications. ``If he can qualify his presence 
means a lot to any golf championship and the fans love him. But 
we're not going to change everything around at the U.S. Open 
because of criticism from one player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a 340-yard drive, Daly's second shot at No. 8 landed to  
the left of the green in one of the dreaded swales at No. 2. He 
tried twice to putt the ball close to the flag, only to have it 
stop short and roll back toward his feet both times. 
</P>
<P>
	With the ball still rolling after his fourth shot, a frustrated  
Daly took a swipe and sent it rocketing over the green. That 
counted as another stroke, plus a two-shot penalty. He finally put 
the ball on the green with his eighth shot and three-putted. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly said he was thinking of a similar episode involving Kirk  
Triplett at last year's Open. Triplett stuck out his putter to stop 
a rolling ball when the USGA had an extremely difficult pin 
placement on the 18th hole at The Olympic Club. Triplett took a 
two-shot penalty and missed the cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am going to stand up for the guys here,'' Daly said when  
asked why he hit the ball while it was still moving. ``I think the 
USGA really needs to learn how to run a golf tournament. I'll pay 
my fines. (Saturday's) pin placements were ridiculous and I think 
most guys will agree. I know now why Bruce Lietzke doesn't play the 
U.S. Open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most fans sat in silence as Daly lost his patience once again on  
the course. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looked more dejected than I've ever seen anybody,'' said  
Hugh Jordan of Whispering Pines, a marshal on No. 8. ``He just 
waked over there so slowly. I just felt terrible for the poor guy. 
I thought he was quitting after he hit the ball, I thought he was 
packing it in. But he went back over there and hit it again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Playing partner Tom Kite said Daly apologized to him, but Kite  
said he wasn't sure Daly was trying to prove a point with his 
action. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't interpret it that way,'' Kite said.  
</P>
<P>
	Three weeks ago at the Memorial, Daly six-putted from 8 feet for  
a 10 and dropped out after the first round with an 82. 
</P>
<P>
	He's had other infamous holes as well, led by an 18 at the 1998  
Bay Hill Classic. Daly tried to clear the water on the par-5 sixth 
hole with a 3-wood -- needing six tries before he finally got it 
right. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year at the British Open, a tournament he won in 1995, Daly  
took a 10 on the final hole of the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're trying to win the golf tournament it makes it hard  
to score as well as you can when you do stuff like that,'' Kite 
said. ``I wouldn't say there's no excuse, people have different 
breaking points, but everybody in this tournament has been 
frustrated this week.''

<HEADLINE> Soccer Brawl at Nepal-Malaysia Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Nepalese soccer fans surged on the field and  
fought with Malaysian players during an Olympic qualifier Sunday, 
leaving several players injured and one hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials who tried to stop the violence were also attacked by  
fans, and the game was called off with two minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
	The condition of those injured was not immediately known,  
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The violence flared when Nepalese fans swarmed the field at Hong  
Kong Stadium after Nepal's Anil Subba tied the score in the 88th 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the fans grabbed the ball and refused to give it to the  
Malaysian players. Dozens of other Nepalese fans then jumped onto 
the field, triggering wild scenes as they fought with the Malaysian 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	The game, an Asian Group 6 soccer qualifier for next year's  
Olympics, was abandoned as officials pondered what to do. 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament also includes teams from Japan, Hong Kong, and  
the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese led the group after the first round, having won all  
four of its games. The second round begins Saturday in Tokyo.

<HEADLINE> Knicks' Ward Scrambles for Answers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Charlie Ward has the eyes of a scrambler,  
darting this way and that as he exhales, scowls and answers 
questions about his team's plight in the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Elusiveness was his greatest tool when he was the best high  
school football player in Georgia, and when he won the Heisman 
Trophy at Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
	He is scrambling again, searching for a way to help the New York  
Knicks climb out of their 2-0 deficit against the San Antonio 
Spurs. It is the equivalent of third-and-long with the clock 
running and no timeouts. 
</P>
<P>
	For a change, there is talk of taking the ball out of Ward's  
hands. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why would we change?'' Ward said, referring to speculation  
that Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy will send Ward to the bench in 
favor of a bigger backcourt of Latrell Sprewell and Allan Houston 
in Game 3 Monday night. ``It's not about a lineup change. That's 
only for you guys to talk about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a quarterback, Ward always seemed able to make something out  
of nothing. As point guard of the Knicks, he has yet to make 
anything look easy against the Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Ward, never as potent on the court as he was on the gridiron,  
has 12 points in two games in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks, struggling to find enough offense with Patrick Ewing  
out and Larry Johnson hobbled with a knee injury, might need to try 
something different in the backcourt. Ward's backup, Chris Childs, 
is 3-for-16 in the series. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Knicks beat the New Jersey Nets late in the season,  
Nets point guard Stephon Marbury left no doubt about his opinion of 
Ward and Childs. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'll never win a championship with those two guys -- never,  
ever, ever,'' Marbury said. ``It's just not going to happen. They 
might not even make the playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Ward responded simply by saying, ``I'm not here to  
please any man. I'm not here to talk about anyone else, so you're 
not going to get me caught up in that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spurs point guard Avery Johnson deflected any credit for the  
Knicks' point guard woes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mark Jackson, in the last series, they needed him to score for  
Indiana to even have a chance,'' Johnson said. ``So with Charlie 
and Chris, their main job is to play defense and to get the ball to 
other guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Ward has any fight left in him, he showed a glimpse of it  
when asked about the lack of production from the Knicks' point 
guards. 
</P>
<P>
	``What do you mean lack of?'' Ward said disdainfully. ``We've  
done a good job of getting the ball to guys, we just haven't made 
the shots that we've needed to. It's not just the point guards, 
it's everyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For someone who says he hates the spotlight, Ward has held two  
of the most visible, pressurized positions in sports: quarterback 
of Bobby Bowden's Seminoles and point guard of the Knicks. The 
folks in Thomasville, Ga., would add quarterback and point guard at 
Central High School to the list, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do I love being in the spotlight? No,'' Ward said. ``I enjoy  
doing my job. Being in the spotlight is not something that I enjoy 
doing, because if I did, I would do crazy things to gain attention 
when I'm not getting attention. And that's the last thing that I'm 
trying to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't need attention or glamour to be successful.''  
</P>
<P>
	Ward has always grasped the meaning of a big game. There is one  
of those scheduled for Monday night at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	It remains to be seen whether Ward will start, or how much he  
will play. 
</P>
<P>
	If he does, it will be as big as any bowl game for him.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Gold Princess was awarded the victory in  
Sunday's $106,400 Vagrancy Handicap at Belmont Park when 
first-place Hurricane Bertie was disqualified and placed second for 
interference in the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Bertie, ridden by Jorge Chavez, completed 6 1/2 furlongs  
in 1:16 2-5 and was one length ahead of Gold Princess at the 
finish. But Hurricane Bertie was penalized one spot for crossing 
over too closely in front of Gold Princess in midstretch.

<HEADLINE> Mariners Trade Mieske for Hodges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Seattle Mariners cleared room for Jay  
Buhner's expected return from the disabled list by trading 
outfielder Matt Mieske to the Houston Astros on Sunday for 
right-hander Kevin Hodges. 
</P>
<P>
	Buhner, placed on the 15-day disabled list on May 19 with a  
strained left hamstring, had hoped to return for Sunday night's 
game against the Indians but had a minor setback and may not be 
back for a few more days. 
</P>
<P>
	However, in anticipation of Buhner coming back, the Mariners  
traded Mieske, who was batting .366 with four homers and seven RBIs 
in 24 games with Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were very happy with Matt Mieske's contribution to our  
ballclub,'' Seattle general manager Woody Woodward said. 
``Unfortunately, with Jay Buhner expected to return from the 
disabled list soon, we had to make this move to clear a spot on our 
roster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hodges began the season with Double-A Jackson of the Texas  
League where he went 1-4 with a 2.94 ERA in eight starts before 
being promoted to Triple-A New Orleans. He was 1-3 at New Orleans 
with a 7.24 ERA in five starts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners said Hodges will probably report to Triple-A  
Tacoma. 
</P>
<P>
	Buhner was batting .268 with six homers and 18 RBIs in 26 games  
before he was injured in a May 18 game against Minnesota.

<HEADLINE> Korea Conglomerates Face Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- For the chairman of the chemical giant  
Hanwha, the past year and a half has been ``like going through a 
major surgery without anesthesia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hanwha's sales tumbled by half as it sold off one asset after  
another to raise desperately needed cash during the recession 
brought on by Asia's economic crisis. Its subsidiaries were pared 
down to 20 from 32. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a terrible sense of deprivation,'' says Lee Yong-ho,  
Hanwha's chief finance officer and the engineer of its 
restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we know better now. We don't mind being small now. We want  
to be a company of substance. It no longer matters how many 
affiliates we have now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For a South Korean conglomerate, that is a momentous change in  
thinking. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanwha is one of South Korea's family-run conglomerates, called  
``chaebol,'' which are known for their aversion to change and for 
their deep pride in a sprawling portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
	For them, business was always about size, their clout measured  
by the number of subsidiaries. Profit was secondary, market share 
everything. Selling assets was considered a big loss of face. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone has changed. Two years into Asia's economic slump,  
the five biggest chaebol -- Hyundai, Samsung, Daewoo, LG and SK -- 
continue to amass assets in a development that international and 
local officials say could threaten South Korea's long-term 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	But dozens of smaller chaebol are trimming down and focusing on  
profitability -- Hanwha a bright example among them. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanwha started as a small company making gunpowder for the South  
Korean military in the 1960s. Over the decades it diversified into 
petrochemicals, machinery, auto parts, oil refining, distribution 
and hotels. 
</P>
<P>
	Debt-financed expansion was the norm among chaebol from the  
1970s to early 1990s, when they fueled South Korea's stunning 
economic growth. Loaded with cash, banks doled out more loans when 
old ones came due. 
</P>
<P>
	``In those days, we never had a problem with the availability of  
bank credits,'' Lee says. ``When that began to change in 1997, we 
were in big trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Asia's financial storms swept into South Korea in late 1997  
and banks tightened credit, Hanwha, then the country's eighth 
largest chaebol, with $10 billion in annual sales, was the first 
pushed to the brink of bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	It avoided collapse at the last minute when the government  
ordered creditor banks to funnel $541 million in emergency loans to 
Hanwha in a desperate attempt to contain the spread of panic in the 
corporate sector. 
</P>
<P>
	It was then that Hanwha initiated its dramatic switch.  
</P>
<P>
	In his office, Chairman Kim Seung-youn put up an ancient Korean  
battlefield motto meant to inspire daring: ``Vow to live, and you 
will die! Vow to die, and you will live!'' 
</P>
<P>
	With that, Hanwha began jettisoning prized assets -- with  
singular speed. 
</P>
<P>
	So far it has:  
</P>
<P>
	--Sold all or part of 12 affiliates, including 70 percent of its  
profitable ball bearing division to Germany's FAG Kugelfischer 
Georg Schaefer AG. 
</P>
<P>
	--Agreed to sell Hanwha Energy, its biggest subsidiary and  
generator of one-third of its total revenues, to rival Hyundai 
Refinery Co. 
</P>
<P>
	--Unloaded 32 pieces of prime real estate.  
</P>
<P>
	--Shed one-fourth of its 20,000 workers. For those who remain,  
wages were frozen and bimonthly bonuses halved. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a tough time for both the company and workers. When the  
company started restructuring, old workers felt the pressure to 
retire early,'' said Kim Soo-bong, 45, who left Hanwha in early 
1998 after 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Through its crash diet, Hanwha unloaded $3 billion in debt and  
raised more than $840 million in cash to lower its debt-to-equity 
ratio to 250 percent from 1,200 percent at the end of 1997 -- a task 
locally praised as the best example of the kind of restructuring 
ordered by President Kim Dae-jung. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanwha lost $140 million last year on sales of $5.1 billion.  
Kim, the chairman, projects a net profit of $250 million this year 
on revenue of $6.25 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors have taken heart. Share prices of Hanwha's two main  
subsidiaries, Hanwha Corp. and Hanwha Chemical Corp., have climbed 
to around $7.50 from last year's low of $1.70. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanwha says it will continue to chop off affiliates and fold  
them into a half dozen nimble, competitive businesses in chemicals, 
retail distribution, leisure facilities and financing. 
</P>
<P>
	``One year ago, when I came to the office in the morning, I  
could almost smell defeat. Now a sense of confidence is spreading 
that we can pull it off,'' says Lee Myong-sop, a middle manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``The past year was a hard time, but a good lesson.''

<HEADLINE> Yosemite Climb Had Unexpected Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) -- When the dust settled,  
Peter Terbush was still clutching the rope. But he didn't survive 
the rock slide that crashed down on his head, and his buddies can't 
believe they did. 
</P>
<P>
	The three experienced climbers were using proper equipment to  
scale Yosemite National Park's Glacier Point Apron, a granite slab 
attractive to newcomers unfamiliar with the territory. 
</P>
<P>
	``That area has great, easy climbing. Beginners love to go there  
because the climb is not real steep,'' said Dave Bengston, director 
of Yosemite Mountaineering School. 
</P>
<P>
	But if the three Colorado climbers had asked, Bengston would  
have warned them away from the slab of rock behind Curry Village. 
</P>
<P>
	It's risky in the spring, when snowmelt can seep into cracks in  
the cliff and freeze during the night, expanding and loosening the 
rock. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I do go there, it's big-time helmet zone,'' said Bengston.  
``That place makes me nervous. I hear rocks coming down all the 
time. All winter long, it was constant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the danger, rock climbing is increasingly popular and  
Yosemite stands as the ``center of the universe,'' attracting 
climbers from all over the globe to challenge granite monoliths 
that stand thousands of feet high. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people breathe, I climb,'' said Dylan Morgan, a  
22-year-old search and rescue team candidate at Yosemite. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the challenge of scaling rocks and cliffs is knowing how  
to eliminate or minimize the risks, he says. ``(A) thousand things 
can go wrong when you're up there, but millions of things could go 
right,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Terbush's companions, Joe Kewin and Kerry Pyle, said they had  
talked to other climbers about the area and didn't think anything 
would happen. Besides, their climb on June 13 was only supposed to 
take about half an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a famous climb. It had some of the best cracks in the  
valley,'' said Kewin, 21. 
</P>
<P>
	There were even fresh chalk marks from the hands of climbers who  
must have been there shortly before, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Terbush stood at the base of the granite face, anchoring the  
belay rope for 20-year-old Pyle as he began scaling the cliff that 
rises towards Glacier Point, a spot with a panoramic view 3,000 
feet above Yosemite Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	Kewin stood behind Terbush, 22.  
</P>
<P>
	They were only planning a short climb, about 300 feet up and  
then back down. 
</P>
<P>
	Pyle had climbed up about 70 feet -- the equivalent of a  
seven-story building -- when they heard what sounded like a clap of 
thunder. 
</P>
<P>
	They were showered at first with small rocks, but then came  
boulders the size of Volkswagens. 
</P>
<P>
	Terbush, a third-generation climber who began rock climbing at  
age 11 with his father, stood his ground. When the billows of dust 
cleared, his hands were still clutching the rope that prevented 
Pyle from falling. 
</P>
<P>
	But he was dead of a massive head wound. Pyle suffered scrapes  
and bruises. Kewin had only a few cuts, and had to pry Terbush's 
fingers from the rope in order to help Pyle down from the cliff. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of us should have died,'' said Pyle. ``Joe and I are lucky  
to be alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pyle and Kewin didn't know what they could have done  
differently. 
</P>
<P>
	And they wanted to try climbing again before leaving the park --  
if only to prove to themselves that they could still do it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to deal with my emotions. I want to see how I feel.  
Climbing is a huge thing in my life,'' Pyle said.

<HEADLINE> Freedom Riders Remember Slain Youth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA, Miss. (AP) -- Mississippi has failed to bring  
justice to the families of three slain civil rights workers, a 
group of youth leaders and veterans of the 1964 freedom ride said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a hundred gathered to urge the state to reopen the  
case 35 years after the killings of James Chaney, Andrew Goodman 
and Mickey Schwerner. 
</P>
<P>
	The congregation, which included dozens of young people who are  
traveling by bus to re-create the historic ``Freedom Rides'' 
through the South, went to the spot where the three were killed in 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am feeling sadness for the fact that my brother is dead,''  
Ben Chaney, brother of James Chaney, said during the ceremony 
marking the 35th anniversary of the deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	``His companions are dead and the state of Mississippi has yet  
to fulfill it's judicial responsibility by prosecuting those who 
conspired and committed the murders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chaney, Schwerner and Goodman were traveling down a Neshoba  
County road on the night of June 21, 1964 when they were ambushed 
by the Ku Klux Klan and shot to death. Their bodies were not found 
until 44 days later when the FBI recovered them from an earthen 
dam. 
</P>
<P>
	The three were part of the group Congress on Racial Equality,  
which organized voter registration drives across the South. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has been convicted of their murders. Seven Klansmen,  
including a sheriff's deputy, were convicted of federal conspiracy 
charges. The investigation has been renewed, but Neshoba County 
District Attorney Ken Turner refuses to comment on the case.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- A bull escaped from an illegal rodeo and  
rampaged through city streets, at times charging at people, before 
police officers shot it dead on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Detective Robert Samuel, a police spokesman, said the bull was  
one of nine owned by a North Carolina-based rodeo company that 
hired a vacant lot in the New York borough of Queens for a show,

<P>
	The animal rumbled several blocks through the neighborhood,  
pursued by cops and a rodeo worker with a lariat, who tried in vain 
to lasso it. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, officers tried to herd the bull into a parking lot, but  
it refused to cooperate and was shot dead after the police deemed 
it a menace to the public.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wants Tougher Gun Show Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton appealed Sunday from Europe  
for the House to reverse course and impose tougher controls on gun 
show sales. Top congressional Democrats looked to use the issue to 
the party's advantage in next year's elections. 
</P>
<P>
	A leading House Republican accused the Democrats of playing  
politics with the issue. Rep. Tom DeLay, the majority whip, blamed 
Democrats for defeating the gun legislation even though Republicans 
agreed to some controls. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate's top Democrat, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, said  
there a ``glimmer of hope'' congressional negotiators working on a 
major juvenile crime bill would include gun control measures 
approved by the Senate but rejected by the House. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to fight as hard as we possibly can,'' Daschle  
said on CBS' ``Face the Nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, in a CNN interview in Cologne, Germany, where he was  
attending a summit of world leaders, pointed to the success of the 
Brady law, which requires background checks on handgun buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past five years, the law has kept guns out of the hands  
of an estimated 400,000 unqualified buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton repeated an appeal, made in his weekly radio address  
taped Saturday, that lawmakers approve background checks on gun 
sales at flea markets and gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said no one seriously has questioned ``there would  
be fewer improper sales and we would make America safer'' if 
lawmakers approved those checks. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle and the House's Democratic leader, Rep. Dick Gephardt of  
Missouri, believe Democrats can gain politically from gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is going to be a very powerful issue'' in the  
coming election,'' Daschle said, given the public's demand for 
tighter controls following the April school shooting in Littleton, 
Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt, appearing on ABC's ``This Week,'' said a small number  
of voters would oppose any gun control advocates. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is the 80 percent who are for gun safety, just  
aren't for it very much, they are not intense,'' Gephardt said, 
adding that it essential to appeal to his large part of the 
electorate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can be run on and it can be won on in any district in this  
country,'' Gephardt said. 
</P>
<P>
	DeLay, R-Texas, said it was the Democrats who played politics on  
the issue. He said Republicans agreed to require that safety locks 
be sold with guns and to ban some ammunition clips, but Democrats 
still brought the gun legislation to defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a great week for us,'' he said on ABC, citing  
approval of legislation that addresses the spiritual education of 
children while imposing tougher penalties for youth crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats led the effort to defeat the gun control portion of  
the juvenile crime bill. The defeat followed House passage of a 
provision, written by Democrat Rep. John Dingell of Michigan and 
backed by Republicans, that Democrats said drastically weakened the 
background checks. 
</P>
<P>
	Dingell's amendment reduced the amount of time allowed for the  
check from three days to 24 hours in all cases. In addition, it 
would have defined gun shows in a way to exclude some events that 
are now covered. 
</P>
<P>
	Dingell, interviewed on ``Fox News Sunday,'' said he thought 24  
hours was ``quite sufficient'' to check backgrounds and ``see to it 
that innocent and law-abiding citizens are not harassed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dingell, the senior Democrat in the House, said Democratic  
support for gun control legislation ``probably did cost us the 
Congress'' in the 1994 election. He said the party, in seeking to 
stop youth violence, should concentrate on other issues such as 
health care programs for troubled youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
	DeLay also said that 24 hours was enough to check would-be gun  
buyers, particularly if the FBI agreed to stay open on weekends, 
when many of the gun shows take place.
