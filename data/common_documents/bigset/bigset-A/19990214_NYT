Kwan overwhelms inexperienced field
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By BILL SULLIVAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SALT LAKE CITY _ She was almost perfect. Before her last jump, the
question wasn't so much whether there would be any 6.0s, but
whether she had left room for anything less.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, almost would have to do, though Michelle Kwan
didn't seem to mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know when that happens, you get back up quick,'' she said,
recounting her one late mistake with a smile. ``What if the judges
blink?''
</P>
<P>
   If they had, they might have missed about the only flaw in
another championship performance from figure skating's current
leading lady.
</P>
<P>
   Suffering a late spill on a triple lutz, the 18-year-old
Californian nevertheless claimed her third United States Figure
Skating Association championship Saturday night at the Delta Center
without much of a threat from a young and thin field.
</P>
<P>
   Naomi Nari Nam, 13, from Irvine, Calif., finished second,
followed by Angela Nikodinov, 18, of San Pedro, Calif. But the
world team that will travel to Helsinki, Finland, next month will
look a little different because Nam is ineligible to go because of
her age.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, that opens a spot for another 13-year-old,
fourth-place finisher Sarah Hughes of Great Neck, N.Y. Hughes is
eligible because of her second-place finish in the recent junior
world championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really worried about not going to worlds,'' Nam said.
``I'm just happy I skated my best.''
</P>
<P>
   Her coach, veteran John Nicks, was less diplomatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a travesty of age discrimination,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the fall Saturday night, Kwan was the runaway winner,
earning seven 5.9s for artistic merit from the nine judges.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't quite as emphatic a statement as the eight 6.0s she
pulled in winning the title in Philadelphia a year earlier, but she
was well on her way to duplicating the feat before the lutz went
awry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had it,'' she said with a shrug. ``I'm not sure
what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter. The defending champion was in good form otherwise,
and she enjoyed every minute of it, particularly a triple
toe/triple toe early in the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted to do that,'' she said. ``I haven't done it in
a year or more.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston's Andrea Gardiner, who suffered a broken hip in July,
struggled again after finishing 17th in Tuesday night's short
program. Hoping for a top-10 finish, the 18-year-old Robert E. Lee
High School senior had to settle for 15th in the long program and
15th overall.
</P>
<P>
   The basically lost season will be chalked up as a learning
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a lot from this competition,'' she said. ``What I
need to do before I go out to skate just little things.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardiner, the 1997 national junior champion and eighth-place
finisher in last year's seniors, heads back to Houston today to
pick up training, finish high school and ``come back stronger next
year.''
</P>
<P>
   The 2002 Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City remain a goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a rough year,'' her coach, Megan Faulkner, said.
``She's never been injured before. It's a really hard thing to come
back from.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some letdowns here this week, and as she said, most of
them were mental. The nerves took over a little.''
</P>
<P>
   Kwan, by contrast, was under little pressure here. To no one's
surprise, the 1998 Olympic silver medalist and defending world
champion was by far the class of the field. And while another shot
at Olympic gold is three years away, it clearly was on Kwan's mind
as she finished her performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, when I looked up, I thought, `Wow. In a couple of
years, this is where they're going to have the 2002 Olympics,'''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   This time out, at least one of the hopefuls looked at home.

Dismantling a winner becomes baseball's economic Catch-22
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By ALAN TRUEX &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you're a baseball fan in most major-league cities, you may
believe the worst thing that can happen to your favorite team is
that it wins a pennant. Nothing destroys a team faster.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be winners tended to stay together; it was the losers
who rebuilt. But in the last two years, the Florida Marlins and San
Diego Padres went for the ring and then when they had it, they
broke up.
</P>
<P>
   It was not romantic, it was economic. And not especially
historic. Baseball champions have been breaking up as far back as
1915, when Connie Mack dismantled the Philadelphia Athletics after
their fourth American League pennant in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Finley tore apart his powerful Oakland A's in the 1970s,
but this sort of thing happens with increasing regularity in the
'90s. Minnesota started losing players soon after winning the '91
World Series. Pittsburgh purged after finishing first, for the
third straight time, in '92.
</P>
<P>
   And now it has happened, back-to-back, with Florida and San
Diego. It's even happening in basketball to the Chicago Bulls,
coming off their sixth NBA title of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   The 1914 A's lost the World Series, but winning it couldn't
preserve the '97 Marlins. One who got away was Kevin Brown, who
pitched the Padres into last year's World Series. Then he jumped to
Los Angeles _ for $105 million, which is $45 million more than the
Padres said they could afford.
</P>
<P>
   If Brown and the rest of an $88 million-salaried roster can
return the Dodgers to postseason glory, Rupert Murdoch's media
empire will have what it wants: a loss leader into its Fox network
programming. What's $88 million to a corporation that earns $90
billion a year?
</P>
<P>
   Larry Lucchino, president of the Padres, saw this coming, but
too late. When Brown signed with the Dodgers, Lucchino screeched:
``The apocalypse is upon us.''
</P>
<P>
   When it came time last year to vote on letting Murdoch and Fox
into their henhouse, the major-league moguls realized they had
gotten in there long before, tying owners up, one by one and
collectively, with various cable contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers unquestionably are raising the salary bar, but
Lucchino's prophesy is not only tardy but self-fulfilling. The
Padres recently traded 50-home-run hitter Greg Vaughn, thereby
lopping $2 million off their player payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Times are changing rapidly. Payroll is becoming increasingly
critical. Minnesota won the '91 Series with the 17th-highest salary
expense in the majors. But then, $27 million separated the biggest
spenders, Oakland, from the smallest, the stripped-for-sale Astros,
whose salaries totaled $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   In this new age of disparity, the difference between the
Dodgers' payroll and Montreal's is almost $80 million. Montreal's
revenues last year were $140 million less than those of the New
York Yankees, whose $80 million from local broadcasting was 10
times what the A's received from theirs.
</P>
<P>
   The free-agency market is becoming an exclusive shopping center.
Of the $1.05 billion committed to free agents in this offseason, 70
percent was spent by six teams: the Dodgers, Arizona Diamondbacks,
Anaheim Angels, Yankees, New York Mets and Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   The elite players have become so expensive that most clubs
cannot afford even one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you have a payroll of $60 million or more,'' Astros
general manager Gerry Hunsicker said, ``it probably doesn't make
economic sense to invest $10 million in one player.''
</P>
<P>
   So here is baseball, heading to spring training, strangely
somber after a magical season in which Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa
blew past Roger Maris and Babe Ruth in the long-elusive home-run
record chase.
</P>
<P>
   The light dims when the focus switches from home-run races to
pennant races. The gap between the filthy rich and the merely rich
draws ever wider, and the imbalance is showing on the field. No
club with a payroll less than the Astros' $48 million played
postseason ball last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dollars don't guarantee anything, but not spending at a
certain level all but guarantees you will not be competitive,''
said Hunsicker, the 1998 National League Executive of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Added Sandy Alderson, Major League Baseball vice president of
operations: ``Fans of 15 to 18 teams will be buying tickets to
watch clubs that can't win.''
</P>
<P>
   Most baseball owners want to change this situation, but therein
lies the greater danger: a nuclear explosion similar to 1994, when
a labor war brought cancellation of the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The current labor agreement expires after 2001. Before signing a
new one, the owners may seek a salary cap similar to what was
recently accepted _ after half a season was lost _ by the players
of the National Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that will prevent owners from locking us out
(in 2002) is they have to get a 75 percent vote to do it,''
Milwaukee Brewers third baseman Jeff Cirillo said.
</P>
<P>
   The owners can make a stronger case for a cap now than they
could in '94, when Montreal had the best record in the majors and
middle-income Philadelphia was the defending NL champ.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the clubs realize that selling the players' union on a
salary cap will be about as easy as selling fleas to a collie.
Hunsicker, a former agent for players (former Astros slugger Glenn
Davis was a client), is well-tuned to their labor views. And he
does not see a salary cap in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you're talking about baseball or the steelworkers,
it's very difficult to ask a union to take something back that they
have bargained for,'' he said. ``In most industries, when those
concessions are granted it's under the umbrella of bankruptcy,
significant layoffs or job losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always seems to take a catastrophe to get people's
attention. That's human nature. Most people don't make difficult
decisions unless they're forced to. Unless some clubs go under,
which would mean jobs are lost, you won't get the employees'
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   No ballclubs have ceased operations in recent decades, and it's
doubtful they will. Baseball has enough revenue sharing and
national television income to allow any club to scratch out a
profit if it keeps player costs under $15 million a year, which
several are doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't draw three million people, you've almost
guaranteed a financial loss,'' Hunsicker said, ``unless you're
going the other way, stripping your team to make a profit.''
</P>
<P>
   While most baseball owners want more revenue sharing, the
Yankees' George Steinbrenner argues that won't help competitive
balance if the have-nots refuse to use their subsidies to acquire
players. Montreal's payroll last year was less than the $12 million
it received in revenue sharing.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker sees Steinbrenner's point.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pirates and Montreal are making money, and that's a
joke,'' he said. ``You've got most teams losing money in an effort
to be competitive, and they're subsidizing teams that are making a
profit by putting uncompetitive teams on the field. That's not fair
to the rest of the teams and certainly not to the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   The small-market teams answer that they must hoard their limited
cash and spend when the boom-or-bust cycle is right. Timing is
everything. The Brewers last year raised their payroll from $22
million to $35 million without improving their record. They found
the middle ground to be no-man's land.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for answers and taking care not to inflame the union,
commissioner Bud Selig has appointed a task force to devise ways of
changing baseball's economic system.
</P>
<P>
   The think tank includes former Senate majority leader George
Mitchell, former Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker, and
author and TV commentator George Will.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be more creative than the people who came before
us,'' Selig said.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he's full-time commissioner, Selig is showing some
creativity himself, vowing to enforce the little-known ``60-40
rule'' that prohibits a club's liabilities from exceeding 40
percent of its assets.
</P>
<P>
   At least 10 teams are believed to be violating this rule,
including the Dodgers, who were purchased by Murdoch for $315
million and are in debt to Brown alone for one third of that
amount.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Selig or his task force will find a way to keep the
heavyweights from crushing everyone else. But for now there's
little consolation for fans of the Marlins, who have only four
players remaining from the world champions of 16 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Padres' purge, it's out of character for John Moores,
the team's owner and a University of Houston alumnus. This was the
free-spender who wants ``to own the Padres the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he appears to be selling out the 1999 season, after the last
one brought droves of bell-ringing fans through the turnstiles and
victories in the playoffs over the favored Astros and Atlanta
Braves. Enough Padres fans also made it to the voters' booths to
pass a referendum for a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Funny thing, owners tend to spend more on ballplayers when
they're seeking public funding for ballparks.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Huizenga turned the Marlins to minnows and sold the team
when he couldn't obtain financial aid for a proposed stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But even a stadium on the way wasn't enough to comfort the
Padres.
</P>
<P>
   Lucchino claimed the new austerity had no connection to the
stadium referendum, that ``last year we were at the end of a cycle.
We had players who were aging and near free agency, and we had to
make a run then. You cannot stay static, especially if you're a
small-market team.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker empathized: ``You make major investments for veteran
talent to go with your young players, and then if your young
players are successful, salary arbitration hits you. So if you're
trying to maintain a mid-level payroll, it's virtually impossible
to keep the team together.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, San Diego is accepting the loss of Brown,
Vaughn and free agents Steve Finley and Ken Caminiti. Padres
general manager Kevin Towers said bringing all of them back would
make his payroll $80 million, which is more than the club's
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres insist they're not giving up on 1999, that the
payroll will approach $50 million, that the up-and-down,
33-year-old Vaughn may never be as good as he was last year and
that this is no Florida Fire Sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``In '96, nobody picked us to win,'' Towers said, ``and we did.
This year we're going to do the same damn thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news for Marlins and Padres fans is that most of the
breaking up is over. What's left of these teams probably will stay
together. At least, until they win again. Nowadays, that's about
all most baseball fans can expect.

UCLA FALLS FLAT AGAINST CAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ Steve Lavin knew it before anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   His team had no energy. It had no desire. It had no heart.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate, he called a timeout 53 seconds into the game _ always
an ominous sign for UCLA. But it did no good.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins rolled over, and Cal stomped.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just got our butts kicked, and I wish I could say the other
word,'' UCLA guard Baron Davis said after an 85-67 loss to the
Bears before a record Pac-10 crowd of 15,676 Saturday at the
Oakland Coliseum Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just drove us, took our hearts and stepped on us,'' Davis
continued, his voice getting louder, angrier, as he talked. ``They
pounded us, and we didn't do nothing but cry. They treated us like
some little kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of black uniforms, maybe the Bruins should wear tin
warmups and go see the Wizard. Perhaps John Wooden will help them
find their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   It was UCLA's worst loss at Cal since 1948, and if not for
Davis' masterpiece _ a career-high 27 points, nine rebounds and
four assists _ it would have been much, much worse.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears were tougher, stronger, quicker to the ball and faster
in transition. They shot 53 percent from the field in the second
half, built a 16-point lead, repelled a brief UCLA rally and
administered the final ``whipping,'' as Davis put it.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA (17-7, 8-5) played without freshman forward Jerome Moiso,
its third-leading scorer who has lost confidence and conditioning
because of tendinitis in his right foot. (``Just walking on it felt
bad,'' he said.)
</P>
<P>
   In his absence, the Bruins turned to freshmen center Dan
Gadzuric, who handled the ball extensively and committed seven
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, I was not focused at all, and I suffered the
consequences,'' Gadzuric said.
</P>
<P>
   His starting center ineffective, Lavin tried multiple players
and combinations. He tried Travis Reed, he tried Matt Barnes, he
tried Ray Young and Ryan Bailey _ and they did not respond.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Lavin settled on seldom-used reserves Brandon Loyd
and Sean Farnham, and they joined Davis, Earl Watson and JaRon
Rush, who played hard but missed 14 of 17 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Lavin announced that Loyd and Farnham will start
Wednesday against USC. Walk-on Todd Ramasar, who has played two
minutes in Pac-10 games, will be the sixth man.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get to the point where we have five guys who
played consistently hard,'' Lavin said. ``That's why I'm starting
Loyd, Farnham, Rush, Watson and Davis (against USC). Those five
played with the greatest effort. Ramasar will be the sixth-man. He
has worked hard in practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows our lack of maturity. We couldn't come back less
than 48 hours (after an emotional loss to Stanford) and play with a
high level of intensity. This was as poor as we've played all
season, other than Maryland.''
</P>
<P>
   The performance underscored the importance of UCLA's victories
at USC and Louisville last month. Despite being swept on a weekend
road trip for the first time since 1993 (at the Washington
schools), the Bruins have enough wins to absorb a few late-season
defeats and qualify for the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   If they had departed the Bay Area with 15 wins, for instance,
they'd be under enormous pressure during the upcoming homestand
against USC, Syracuse, Washington State and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, with an at-large bid secured and the Pac-10 title
probably out of reach _ UCLA trails Stanford by three games _
Saturday's loss seemingly had only one tangible effect: It probably
eliminated UCLA from consideration for a No. 3 seed in the NCAA
Tournament and relegated the Bruins to a No. 4 or 5 seed.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the difference between a No. 3 and 4 seed is
potentially enormous: as a No. 4, the Bruins would face the mighty
No. 1s like Duke or Connecticut in the Sweet 16 instead of the
Elite Eight.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA selection committee does not look kindly on 20-point
defeats in mid-February, especially to a seventh-place team, and
the Bruins know it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't respond with the necessary aggression for a game
this deep in the season,'' Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   As he dressed quickly to catch the late-afternoon flight home,
Davis' voice boomed throughout the locker room. Two weeks ago,
after the technical fouls at Washington, he was frustration
incarnate. Saturday, he was just plain mad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We laid down and let them walk all over us,'' he said. ``We
just didn't bring it. I'm not going to let it happen again, it's
not going to happen. It starts in practice. We're going to practice
hard. If we lose, we're going to go down fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I refuse to let someone take our hearts like they did
tonight.''

USC STUNS NO. 6 STANFORD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STANFORD _ Point guard Brandon Granville, frustrated over USC's
penchant for narrow losses, decided to speak up as the Trojans
gathered at midcourt prior to tipoff against Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``We huddled before the game and I told the guys, `It's about
time for the ball to bounce our way,' '' Granville said.
</P>
<P>
   He had no idea he could be so right.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every USC player found a bounce to his liking Saturday.
Brian Scalabrine made the first 3-point shot of his college career.
Elias Ayuso said he hit the two biggest free throws of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman forward Sam Clancy had the most important blocked shot
of his budding career.
</P>
<P>
   Granville simply turned in the best game of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Put it together, and the Trojans stunned No. 6-ranked Stanford
in overtime 86-82 before 7,391 at Maples Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   How significant was the victory? It was the Trojans' first win
over a top 10 opponent on the road since they defeated No. 2 UCLA
86-82 in 1992. The Trojans had not defeated a top 25 team on the
road since beating No. 19 Nevada-Las Vegas 90-74 in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   It also may have salvaged a season that quickly deteriorated, as
the Trojans (12-10, 4-9) dropped nine of their first 12 Pac-10
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does make up for a lot,'' Ayuso said. ``Beating the No. 6
team in the nation. That's big on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It rates with the Arizona game last year,'' said USC coach
Henry Bibby, referring the Trojans' 91-90 upset of the
second-ranked Wildcats at the Sports Arena. ``That win was great.
Today was bigger because we did it on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   USC silenced the normally rambunctious sellout crowd at Maples
Pavilion by doing all the things Bibby usually singles out as the
team's shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans played stifling defense, holding Stanford to 39
percent shooting, including 24 percent on 3-pointers. USC also made
its own shots, shooting 48 percent from the field and eight of 21
of its 3-point shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said all along we have to make shots to win games. The
defense has come around. It's a young team and we haven't given
up,'' Bibby said. ``For us, any win has been good. It doesn't
matter if it's Stanford or the Boys Club.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford, which only two weeks ago was pondering an undefeated
Pac-10 season, was searching for explanations over how it could
lose to USC at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out and thought we would run over them,'' point guard
Arthur Lee said. ``They were making shots. Man, they made every
shot they took, it seemed like.''
</P>
<P>
   None were bigger than Scalabrine's desperation 3-pointer from
the top of the key with two seconds left on the shot clock, and 56
seconds left in overtime. It gave the Trojans a 79-74 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't have a choice,'' Scalabrine said. ``We tried
to run a play. It kind of broke down. That's more thanking the Lord
than my skill. I'm not a terrible shooter but making it over a 6-8
(Mark) Madsen is a lot of luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford (20-5, 10-2) still felt it had plenty of time, and cut
the lead to 82-80 on Lee's drive with 25 seconds left. But
Scalabrine (a team-high 22 points) hit two free throws with 19
seconds left to give USC a four-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Young made a 15-foot jump shot to bring Stanford within two
points (84-82) with four seconds left. Then Ayuso calmly sank two
free throws to seal the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to make them understand that 'SC could beat us,''
Stanford coach Mike Montgomery said. ``But maybe they didn't get
it. To 'SC's credit, the played great.''
</P>
<P>
   Although USC led 59-48 with under 10 minutes to go, the Cardinal
kept rallying. Lee scored nine straight points, and Stanford
trailed 59-57 with 7:06 left.
</P>
<P>
   Young's 3-point play gave the Cardinal their first lead, 64-63,
with 4:09 remaining. But the Trojans never folded. Scalabrine hit a
15-footer with 1:13 left that tied the game, 70-70.
</P>
<P>
   Then Clancy made a crucial defensive play. Madsen had the ball a
few feet from the basket with 53 seconds left, and tried to shoot,
but Clancy blocked it and USC regained possession.
</P>
<P>
   Granville and Lee badly missed 3-point shots in the final
seconds to send the game into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   It was a one of Granville's few poor shots. The 5-foot-8
freshman had 21 points and seven assists in a career-high 43
minutes, and made five 3-point field goals.
</P>
<P>
   The players admitted that the adrenalin from playing the No. 6
team in the country prevented them from experiencing fatigue.
Besides Granville's 43 minutes, Scalabrine and Clancy (12 points,
10 rebounds) each played 42.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say it makes our season, but it puts us on the
right track,'' Scalabrine said. ``I'm not going to say we're going
to the tournament or anything, but maybe the NIT.''

NILSMARK HAS LPGA LEAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY MORGAN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENDALE _ There is a young, talented Swede leading the way
after two rounds of the Valley of the Stars Championship, but it's
not who you think.
</P>
<P>
   Catrin Nilsmark, who often has been overshadowed by the exploits
of fellow Swedes Annika Sorenstam, Helen Alfredsson and Liselotte
Neumann, set an Oakmont Country Club course record with a
brilliant, 7-under-par 65 on Saturday for a 36-hole total of
11-under-par 133. It was good for a two-shot lead entering today's
final round.
</P>
<P>
   Nilsmark said she isn't bothered by the lack of recognition. In
fact, she takes it good-naturedly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've wished I've been from Norway or something,'' she said
with a smile. ``I've done that, but not anymore. I'm just happy
being from Sweden.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Lowe, who held the lead for most of the day Saturday,
is two strokes behind at 9-under 135 after a solid 67. Then there
is Sorenstam, who struggled with her putter and settled for a 70
and a two-round total of 7-under 137.
</P>
<P>
   Nilsmark, on the other hand, hardly struggled at all. She did
have two bogeys, but she also had seven birdies (including three on
her first three holes). All except one, a 10-footer on the par-4,
360-yard 16th hole, were inside 10 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're playing well,'' she said, ``birdies should be
within a few feet''.
</P>
<P>
   Nilsmark closed her round in spectacular fashion. She put her
second shot in a greenside bunker on the par-5, 440-yard 18th hole
and holed her effort out of the sand for an eagle 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to hit it all the way up there, not leave it
short,'' she said of the 40-foot blast. ``If it wasn't the best,
it's up there as one of my best bunker shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Nilsmark's 65 broke the course record held by Terry-Jo Myers,
Leta Lindley and Sorenstam, who said she was not surprised by
Nilsmark's performance. She played with her in last year's Solheim
Cup at Muirfield Village and was impressed by what she saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a streaky player,'' Sorenstam said. ``She really rises
to the occasion. I think she's one of the best putters coming down
the stretch. Except on No.18, when she didn't have to putt. But she
would have made it if she had to.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a great player, and she showed it today.''
</P>
<P>
   Nilsmark hit a long drive and was in-between clubs for her
second shot. She knew a five wood would be too much and a
three-iron might not be enough, so she went with the shorter club
and aimed away from a menacing bunker well short and to the right
of the green. If she mis-hit it short or off-line, she said, she
wanted to go left.
</P>
<P>
   Her effort out of the sand landed about 15 feet short of the
hole and rolled in, dead-center.
</P>
<P>
   ``She played well all day,'' Lowe said of Nilsmark. ``She played
a great bunker shot on 18. It looked like it was going to be close,
whether it went in or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Jane Geddes, who won at Oakmont CC in 1987 when the tournament
was called the GNA/Glendale Federal Classic, had a 2-under 70 and
is all alone at 5-under 139. Another stroke behind were defending
champion Dale Eggeling (second straight 70) and Cindy Flom (69).
</P>
<P>
   Dottie Pepper, who once challenged for the lead in Friday's
first round, had an even-par 72 and is tied with La Canada's
Alfredsson and Neumann at 3-under 141.
</P>
<P>
   Se Ri Pak, who opened the tournament with a three-over 75, came
back with a 70 and is in a large group at 145 that included Pat
Bradley, Emilee Klein, Pat Hurst and Alison Nicholas.
</P>
<P>
   The cut was made at 6-over 150. Among the casualties were
Michelle McGann (79-151), Sherri Steinhauer (73-153) and Jan
Stephenson (79-153).

RODMAN HAS ALREADY BEEN SIDESHOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Man to man if not face to face or in so many
words, Derek Harper sent a message Saturday to Dennis Rodman, the
NBA's leading free agent and free spirit:
</P>
<P>
   Don't join the young Lakers if you're the same old Dennis.
</P>
<P>
   Of course Harper, applying his Illinois psychology degree,
didn't put it quite that bluntly, knowing Rodman takes unkindly to
orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's going to shock the world. I think he's going to
come here and set an example for this young basketball team,'' said
Harper, who at 37 is five months older than Rodman and seven years
older than any other Laker. ``I think he's tired of being a
distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   In that clever statement to reporters keeping a Rodman watch at
the Lakers' Southwest Los Angeles College practice gym, Harper
probably wasn't saying what he truly expects to happen if the team
signs the NBA's top rebounder and freakiest personality. Instead he
was laying down lofty new expectations for Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trying my best to,'' Harper admitted with a hopeful smile
after the crowd went off to listen to Del Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Trying is the best anybody can do with Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, the party line among Lakers questioned about Rodman
has been, ``Dennis will be Dennis, a sideshow and a disciplinary
time bomb, but we can handle it and in any case we could use the
rebounds.''
</P>
<P>
   They probably know better than anybody else whether they'd be
distracted.
</P>
<P>
   But Harper said something different. He's not sure his teammates
!ital!can!off! handle it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any distraction,'' he said, ``is going to be cancer for this
team.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a distraction already if the Lakers choose to let it be
one.
</P>
<P>
   A newspaper report that Rodman has decided he's willing to join
the Lakers for the veterans' minimum, which would be a $600,000
salary in the lockout-shortened NBA season, drew an unusually large
crowd of reporters and minicams to the team's last practice before
this afternoon's national-TV showdown with Eastern favorite Indiana
at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   A Lakers management spokesman said nothing had been signed or
agreed to.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the gym, the name Dennis Rodman never came up, insisted
Robert Horry, the Lakers power forward who might have the most to
lose if Rodman signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only time we talk about it,'' Kobe Bryant said, ``is when
we say, `Did you hear anything new?'''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the gym, they couldn't avoid talking about it, with
everybody carrying a notebook or microphone seeking further
speculation on the Worm.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might be doing this just to keep his name out there,''
Horry speculated wryly. ``That's not an annoyance as much as you
asking us about him.''
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing to put up with a circus atmosphere when you're
enjoying the contributions of a teammate who led the league in
rebounding seven years in a row, made the all-defensive team seven
times and won five championships with Detroit and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   It's another thing to put up with a circus atmosphere when
you're getting nothing in return.
</P>
<P>
   As any Dodger could tell you after the Randy Johnson trade watch
last summer, these things don't help a team that's trying to get
its head straight.
</P>
<P>
   Which describes the Lakers after an opening week that included
encouraging wins over Houston and San Antonio and discouraging
losses to Utah and Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely need to be more focused as a basketball team,''
Harper said. ``Collectively, as a group, we have enough talent to
win a championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``But talent isn't always the most important thing. Knowledge
and been-there-done-that is what it's all about. All talent does is
make you read your headlines and think you're better than you are.

   ``With all the expectations of being great, there's a price
you've got to pay. You've got to be able to sacrifice for your

   Harper, a point guard in his 16th NBA season, is on his fourth
team in four years after choosing the Lakers over the Pacers for
the promise of more playing time behind Derek Fisher than behind
Mark Jackson. Although he has never won a title or made an All-Star
team, Harper instantly became the voice of authority among Lakers
players, and not just because of the self-confidence in his booming
delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody who watched Harper pull 20-year-old Bryant aside after a
couple of youthful indiscretions early in the Lakers' first
exhibition game had to think, ``I never saw Nick Van Exel offer a

Harper is the adult.

Saturday.

<P>
   To Harper that means setting a good example _ showing up early
for practice and staying late, etc.

   He doesn't plan to serve as an outrider for the rambunctious
Rodman, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not here to be the doctor for somebody, a counselor for
somebody,'' Harper said. ``I'm here to win championships.

PRONGER'S ROLE IS AS CHECKING CENTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ The newest King wasn't able to make it to Los
Angeles in time to play in Saturday night's game, but coach Larry
Robinson already has a role in mind for Sean Pronger, who was
acquired from the New York Rangers on Friday for left wing Eric
Lacroix.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said he plans to try the 6-foot-2 Pronger as a checking
center, a role that could free No. 1 center Jozef Stumpel to
concentrate on offense and relieve him of tiring penalty-killing
duties. Pronger is expected to be available to make his Kings debut
Monday at the Forum against the Mighty Ducks, one of his former
teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember him from Anaheim,'' Robinson said. ``They said in
New York they didn't think he had a good enough first step, but he
seems to be a good skater. He has good offensive skills and he's
good on faceoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings have a wealth of centers on their current roster:
Pronger, Stumpel, Olli Jokinen, Ian Laperriere, Ray Ferraro and
Yanic Perreault, who was a healthy scratch Saturday night for the
second consecutive game.
</P>
<P>
   Perreault, who has scored six goals in his last 45 games, said
he was not worried about his role on the team even with Pronger's
addition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to focus on what my job is,'' Perreault said.
``If they need me, I'll be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Lacroix leaves again: Lacroix cleaned out his locker Saturday
morning before leaving to join his new team. Among his final acts
was writing a note to his former teammates on the marker board in
the dressing room: ``Boys, Good luck tonite. See you soon, E.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the board,'' center Ian Laperriere said. ``Not too
many guys who were traded would write that down. I know I didn't
write that down when I was traded twice.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, according to Robinson, Lacroix had asked to be traded
about two weeks ago because he was disappointed by his lack of
playing time. Robinson said Lacroix's lack of speed was a liability
on a Kings team lacking overall quickness.
</P>
<P>
   Courtnall honored: Center Russ Courtnall, who on Wednesday
became the 135th player in NHL history to appear in 1,000 games,
was honored before the game. His teammates gave him an engraved
watch, and the Kings' organization gave him and his family a trip
to Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 1, after appearing in his 1,000th game, defenseman Garry
Galley's wife decorated their home with 1,000 roses. Courtnall's
wife, Paris, had one of her husband's sticks bronzed to commemorate
his 1,000th game.
</P>
<P>
   Murray setback: The Kings' hopes of having right wing Glen
Murray in the lineup for Monday's game against the Mighty Ducks
took a hit when Murray did not skate Saturday because he had a
cold. Murray has been sidelined since Jan. 2 with a knee injury.

A SCARY TIME FOR SORENSTAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENDALE _ The Sports Illustrated swimsuit shoot was a one-foot
uphill putt for golfer Annika Sorenstam.
</P>
<P>
   The three-time Player of the Year is the cover girl for the 1999
LPGA media guide, so you could say she's used to the exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, it was a little strange, baring a lot of her body for
an SI spread that includes some of the world's most beautiful
women. But at least it wasn't scary.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind how she, uh, stacks up against the comely Heidi Klum.
Nothing can compare to the discomfort Sorenstam felt when she
opened a Christmas card sent by strangers and her picture was
splashed all over the front of it.
</P>
<P>
   That happened this past year. The card was sent by a creepy
couple that came to tournaments all over Europe, finagling media
credentials so they could get that much closer to snap rolls of
film of their favorite player. Sorenstam imagines the couple has
taken so many photographs of her by now, ``they might have me as
their wallpaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there are others where those two come from.
Sorenstam, 28, and her husband David Esch have set aside a ``weird
file'' to keep track of the worst of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten several scary letters and have been approached by
weird people,'' the softspoken Swede said Saturday after the second
round of the Valley of the Stars Championship at Oakmont Country
Club.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam, who led after the first day, added a 2-under-par 70
to her opening 67 and stands third. She is four shots behind
countrywoman Catrin Nilsmark and two behind Stephanie Lowe.
</P>
<P>
   There were 128 other golfers on the 6,276-yard layout, though
you never would have known it. So many people were following the
pairing of Sorenstam, Nilsmark and Lowe, it's a wonder every putt
on the course didn't break toward the threesome.
</P>
<P>
   If the galleries tilted in their favor, Sorenstam's chaste pose
with Esch in the most ogled magazine that doesn't come wrapped in
brown paper might have had something to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   There was the fan who saw Sorenstam and screamed to his buddy,
``There she is, the swimsuit girl!'' and then there were others who
let Sorenstam know, more subtly, that they saw what she did in
December.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten a lot of positive reaction,'' said Sorenstam, who
admitted ``I wasn't too keen on doing it at first.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam has been involved in five playoffs in her six years on
the LPGA Tour and won back-to-back U.S. Opens and none of that
rattled her as much as the prospect of posing in a bathing suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golf is a very traditional sport and I'm a very traditional
person,'' Sorenstam said. ``For me that was kind of being crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the screwballs to consider. Was Sorenstam
inviting more trouble by exposing herself to a wider audience?
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the more well known you get, the chances increase
of people following you around and acting (inappropriately),''
Sorenstam said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the strange letters that Sorenstam receives are
intercepted by Esch, who is not shy about alerting the proper
authorities. Some of the ones Sorenstam has seen have left her
shaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``It scares you when these people become so into you that they
know more about you than you know about yourself,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Golfers have more reasons to worry than most professional
athletes. A gallery rope is about all that separates them from
their fans. And sometimes there's no barrier at all.
</P>
<P>
   To get from the fifth green to the sixth tee here, for example,
players have to cross the same bridge used by spectators. There are
no volunteers manning the area; hence, no one save the players'
caddies to keep enthusiastic fans at arm's length.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golf is the only sport where you can get really close to a
player,'' Sorenstam said. ``Someone could easily do something and
there's nothing a player could do.''
</P>
<P>
   Moira Dunn, who survived the second-day cut by one stroke,
realized just how vulnerable players are at a tournament in Old
Hickory Tennessee last May. During one of her rounds she heard
something that sounded like a car backfiring.
</P>
<P>
   Then she felt something whistle past her ear and rustle the
leaves on a nearby tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when I realized it was a bullet,'' Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
   She and her playing partners never did find out who fired the
shots. The best they could figure is that someone oblivious to
their presence on the course was doing a little target shooting in
the adjacent swamp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of scary when it comes down to it,'' Dunn said.
``Something like that kind of makes you think.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider that a member of Tiger Woods' gallery at a tournament
in Phoenix last month was found to be carrying a concealed weapon
and you realize there potentially are more hazards out there for
golfers than sand and water.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever Sorenstam spots the couple that sent her the Christmas
card or any of the other strange characters who come around to
tournaments, ``My heart stops beating,'' she said. ``You have this
feeling of `What are they going to do now?' It scares me. I see a
lot of movies.''
</P>
<P>
   So far no one has made Sorenstam feel like Wesley Snipes'
character in ``The Fan.''
</P>
<P>
   You can understand, though, if any of the players cringed when
they saw the paper fans that a certain discount store passed out to
spectators.
</P>
<P>
   Each one had a target on it. &QL;

L.A. TEAMS GEAR UP FOR NFL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the NFL's expansion committee meets Tuesday in Atlanta,
neither of the two groups seeking a franchise for Los Angeles, the
Michael Ovitz/Carson team nor the Ed Roski/New Coliseum squad, will
be in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   A skeptic would say that's a bad sign. It's hard to score
touchdowns when you aren't allowed on the field.
</P>
<P>
   But if one is to believe the NFL, this is the clearest sign yet
that the league is serious about returning to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   While the committee will receive updates of the Ovitz and Roski
proposals and discuss the positives and negatives, it will also
discuss its own alternative selecting a site somewhere in L.A.,
assisting in stadium construction, and then opening up the bidding
for a franchise to all-comers.
</P>
<P>
   That is the model the league used to return a franchise in
Cleveland. Working with city officials who contributed $166 million
to a new stadium, the league spent $54 million to help finance
construction and assisted with Private Seat License sales. Al
Lerner won the bidding for the franchise at $530 million, which
included paying the NFL back its $54 million.
</P>
<P>
   If the league's criteria was merely a new stadium, oodles of
public money and a well-heeled owner, then the NFL would already
have handed a franchise to Houston and businessman Robert McNair.
The Houston proposal has been complete and in hand for more than
six months.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. is important enough, league sources say, to consider the
Cleveland option and commit to it as early as mid-March, when the
league owners hold their annual meetings in Phoenix. That decision,
they add, wouldn't necessarily preclude Ovitz or Roski as owners or
Carson or the Coliseum as the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The importance (in L.A.) is to do it right and eliminate the
risks,'' said Roger Goodell, the NFL's Vice-President of
Development. ``There's been a high degree of frustration in the
L.A. market, and we've taken a (public relations) hit in the
process. We need to do this one right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing we should vote for is a plan with holes,'' said
Jerry Richardson, the Carolina Panthers owner who is on the
expansion committee. ``And at the end of the day, the biggest issue
usually is the stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles has every right to be as skeptical of the league as
it was Georgia Frontiere and Al Davis. The NFL did nothing to stop
the Rams from leaving, never wanted the Raiders to come, and did
very little up to this point to fill the void they left behind.
</P>
<P>
   The league says it has the best interests of L.A. in mind, but
the push for the Cleveland option raises several other questions:
</P>
<P>
   Is the league actually saying that Ovitz and Roski can't pull
this off?
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz's personal worth has been estimated at $250 million to
$500 million. But much of the $138 million settlement he received
upon leaving Disney he was hired as the company's president but
fired a year later came in stock options with limits on when and
how they could be cashed.
</P>
<P>
   Precious little information regarding the financial strength of
his ownership group has been available. Carson Mayor Peter Fajardo
expected a position paper detailing all revenue and equity shares
last September, and he's still waiting.
</P>
<P>
   An Ovitz NFL presentation document obtained from Carson
officials included no equity breakdown, alluded to Ovitz ``or an
affiliate'' as principal owner, and did not include stock market
broker Ted Forstmann.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz spokesman Peter Levin said Forstmann is still of the
group, but declined to answer any other specific questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working very closely with the league in shaping our
proposal,'' he said. ``We have made what we consider to be a sound
proposal, and it's been the same proposal from the beginning. And
we're not comfortable elaborating (on it publicly).''
</P>
<P>
   The net worth of Roski, the Kings' co-owner who is building The
Staples Center, is estimated at $400 million to $700 million. But
NFL concerns that he is over-extended led him to take on
billionaire Eli Broad as a partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want anyone thinking there was an equity
restraint,'' said New Coliseum vice-president John Semcken. ``We're
not trying to encourage anyone raising the (franchise fee number),
but we wanted the league to know it can be covered.''
</P>
<P>
   A league source said the committee considers worse-case
scenarios in awarding franchises, and the biggest fear is that the
cost of building a stadium and buying a team in L.A. could be too
much at one time for any group.
</P>
<P>
   If the NFL builds the stadium, he said, it can remove that
potential problem. It would also be involved in selling name rights
to the facility and PSLs, and balance those figures into stadium
costs. The NFL considers PSL revenue projections of both groups
(Carson $75 million, Coliseum $100 million) to be too optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Is the league stalling because it knows expansion fees are only
increasing?
</P>
<P>
   The Browns' franchise value has been set at $476 million, and
the Redskins and their stadium just sold for $800 million. Both
L.A. groups are speculating that the franchise fee will be $500
million. But if the NFL delays naming an owner for a year, that
price could increase by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the Phoenix Cardinals are seeking public money for a new
stadium. Any decision in March tied to a dollar figure could impact
how much state and city officials are willing to spend to keep the
Cardinals happy.
</P>
<P>
   As an example of value inflation, Philips Electronics has
offered $150 million to $180 million for naming rights to a new
arena in Atlanta, dwarfing the $100 million Staples is paying (over
20 years) to name the new Kings and Lakers downtown arena.
</P>
<P>
   Is this the NFL's way of getting more public money, its favorite
kind, and creating new competition?
</P>
<P>
   Carson's proposed investment has been capped at $180 million.
The New Coliseum says its proposal includes in excess of $300
million of public money, but the league does not agree with the
Coliseum's math. Much of the public money in the Coliseum proposal
comes in the form of already completed investment.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL is getting much greater public investment in new
stadiums in other cities Pittsburgh ($147 million), Cleveland ($166
million), Detroit ($180 million), Nashville ($292 million), Seattle
($300) and Cincinnati ($404 million). Connecticut will spend $375
million to build the Patriots a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL plan would encourage Hollywood Park and Inglewood to
renew its bid to build a stadium adjacent to the race track and
casino.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL has always liked the idea of a stadium next to Dodger
Stadium. Dodgers President Bob Graziano said the team and Fox
officials will continue to support the New Coliseum as requested by
Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan until it hears otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   League sources say its plan doesn't preclude Ovitz or Roski as
the prospective owner or either Carson or the Coliseum as the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I think they have the leverage to ask for a decision
now, and would prefer we pick them now, they would rather get a
franchise (anyway) than not,'' said a league official. ``And we
would probably continue to develop the sites until we were
convinced there's a better one.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it stalling because it wants the pending lawsuit, over who
owns the NFL rights in L.A., involving Al Davis and the Raiders
settled before moving ahead?
</P>
<P>
   Davis has been and remains the NFL original wild card, and the
case isn't scheduled to begin until this summer.

STARS KEEP CONTROL OF PACIFIC THEATER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Another trip to the greater Los Angeles area and
another four points for the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars continued their dominance over Southern California
last night with a 3-2 victory over the Kings at the Great Western
Forum. When combined with Friday's 3-2 victory over the Mighty
Ducks in Anaheim, the Stars now are 5-0-1 this season against their
new Pacific Division rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars move their NHL-best record to 32-10-8 and stay four
points ahead of the Phoenix Coyotes for first place in the Western
Conference. The Coyotes, 4-1 winners over the Colorado Avalanche
yesterday, have played two more games than the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Stars pushed their undefeated streak against
the Kings to 15 games (9-0-6), raised their record against all
Pacific Division teams to 11-2-2, and improved their road unbeaten
streak to seven games (6-0-1).
</P>
<P>
   No. 2 goalie Roman Turek, meanwhile, pushed his record to 9-1-2.
</P>
<P>
   It was a great end to a week in Southern California in which the
Stars soaked up some sunshine, played some golf and prepared
themselves for a lot of hockey. They play four games at home in the
next seven days.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars started the scoring, getting the first goal on a Brett
Hull rebound shot at the 12:13 mark of the first period. It was the
30th time in 50 games the Stars scored first and pushed their
first-period scoring advantage on opponents to 52-36. In games in
which the Stars score first, they are 22-3-5.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars then pushed that to 2-0 on a beautiful play by Joe
Nieuwendyk and Pat Verbeek. Nieuwendyk swooped in behind the net
and fed Verbeek, who was sneaking into the slot. Verbeek buried a
one-timer for his 12th goal of the season and his first in the past
eight games.
</P>
<P>
   But just as the Stars seemed to have complete control of the
game, the Kings came roaring back, scoring twice in a span of 40
seconds to tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Ferraro's impressive solo effort beat Turek at the 4:34 mark
of the second period. Ferraro, worked his way around two Stars
players, drifted into the left circle, faked one shot and then
slipped a wrister over Turek's pad.
</P>
<P>
   Kings winger Matt Johnson then beat Stars center Tony Hrkac to a
long rebound that Turek had left sitting about 15 feet from the net
and Johnson slapped in the game-tying at the 5:14 mark.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars immediately rallied. They began dominating shifts,
earned a clear advantage in shots (12-7 in the second period) and
regained the lead on a hard-working shift from the line of Guy
Carbonneau, Brent Severyn and Dan Keczmer.
</P>
<P>
   Keczmer and Severyn outworked two Kings defenders behind the net
and came up with control of the puck. Severyn then fed Carbonneau
driving to the net and Carbonneau scored his second goal of the
season at the 13:25 mark of the second period. It was Severyn's
second assist in 14 games this season and Keczmer's first in 20
games.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings ended up outshooting the Stars, 26-22, on the strength
of a 12-3 shots advantage in the third period. But Turek held his
own, and the Stars penalty killer proved strong down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars also caught a break when Donald Audette's third-period
goal was disallowed on review. Audette struck the puck just inches
above the cross-bar, a high stick infraction that negated what
would have been the game-tying goal.

MISS THE ALL-STAR GAME? HERE'S YOUR FANTASY REPLACEMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHAKEADELPHIA _ You haven't died, just gone to Hoops Heaven.
</P>
<P>
   No, it's not the 1999 NBA All-Star Game originally scheduled
Sunday to culminate a festive weekend at Philadelphia's First Union
Center. The lockout sent those relatively mundane plans the way of
the peach basket months ago.
</P>
<P>
   In its place, here is the ultimate dream game featuring the
ultimate dream teams in an All-Millennium Game. This dream is
spiced with the 20th Century's best players, coaches, referees,
announcers and fans from the East and West, featuring Michael
Jordan vs. Jerry West, Bob Cousy vs. Magic Johnson, and Johnny Most
vs. Chick Hearn and will surely atone for fans missing another
Sunday of Kobe Bryant waving off screens from his peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worth using my .1 percent loophole to return,'' said
Jordan, refreshingly without Ahmad Rashad in his ear or even in the
arena. ``Finally, let's settle the debate about who is the
greatest.''
</P>
<P>
   In this All-Time, All-Star Game, only the best of the best
earned invitations.
</P>
<P>
   Most and Hearn, the legendary voices of the heated rival Celtics
and Lakers, are yacking oblivious to one another along press row.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious the East will reign supreme because of the
influence of the Celtics' greats and Celtics' ghosts,'' gravels
Most. ``The only shame is that they didn't have time to turn this
floor into parquet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He Got Lame,'' retorts Lee, a finger in Nicholson's face.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the sold-out arena are the league's most respected
referees, Darrell Garrettson, Mendy Rudolph and Earl Strom,
followed by none other than Dr. James Naismith, set to toss the
ceremonial jump ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dr. looks taller in person,'' says East coach Red
Auerbach, flanked by assistants Phil Jackson and Chuck Daly.
</P>
<P>
   ``So does that Dr.,'' says West coach Lenny Wilkens, pointing
out East forward Julius Erving to assistants Pat Riley and Jack
Ramsay. ``I hope we can match-up. There's a lot riding on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Only if you consider bragging rights for 100 years significant.
</P>
<P>
   Like Miss America pageant losers in one of those half-hearted,
pre-Finals routines, wannabes Alonzo Mourning, Chris Webber and
Allen Iverson warm-up with never-weres Charles Barkley and Patrick
Ewing for their part in the halftime entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry guys,'' says East guard Isiah Thomas as he strides
toward the court, ``but it don't mean a thing unless you win a
ring. Or two.''
</P>
<P>
   The most impressive and well-decorated collection of players to
ever grace a court form two 15-member teams sporting an incredible
73 championships, 38 MVPs, 67 All-Defensive Team selections and 323
All-Star appearances.
</P>
<P>
   It may not be the 30 greatest players of the century, but moreso
each conference's top three players by position based on individual
statistics, team achievements, and off-court ambassadorship of the
sport. Barkley, for example, has Hall-of-Fame numbers, but wasn't
invited to the All-Millenium gathering because he has more arrests
than championships.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkens, the NBA's all-time winningest coach, and Auerbach,
owner of nine rings, have three five-man teams to play in the first
three quarters. In the fourth, they are free to substitute any
combinations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear players saying all the time they'd play the game for
free,'' says East forward Larry Bird. ``I bet a bunch of us would
pay to play in this one.'' THE LINEUPS
</P>
<P>
   Buzz in the building before tip-off centers on the
first-quarter, first-unit matchups. Johnson figures to use his
6-foot-9 to 6-1 size advantage to take Cousy into the low post,
while Auerbach will counter by isolating Jordan on the step-slower
West on the perimeter. At small forward, it's Bird's savvy against
Elgin Baylor's speed, though Wilkens is hinting that he might put
Baylor on Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elgin was Michael Jordan before Michael Jordan could even
spell N-B-A,'' Wilkens said. ``It's the matchup everyone wants to
see. If anyone in the history of basketball has the size and
agility to stop Michael, it's Elgin.''
</P>
<P>
   In the paint, power forwards Elvin Hayes and Karl Malone will
trade fallaway jumpers over each other, while Bill Russell and Wilt
Chamberlain renew their legendary rivalry under the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Best team Wilt has ever played on,'' Russell grins, ``and he's
still gonna lose to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The second-quarter lineups seem to favor the West with up-tempo
scorers Clyde Drexler, James Worthy and Bob Pettit, but no unit all
day will be able to top the East's pizzazz of Isiah Thomas, Pete
Maravich and Julius Erving. Near halftime, the West to goes to a
two-man game of Oscar Robertson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar with the
East countering with rugged defenders Jerry Lucas and Moses Malone.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to predict Jabbar's points, fouls and turnovers against
him, Malone grumbles, ``Fo', five, fo'.''
</P>
<P>
   The third quarter features intriguing matchups of gritty point
guards Walt Frazier and John Stockton, scrappy small forwards in
John Havlicek and Rick Barry, punishing power forwards Kevin McHale
and Nate Thurmond and wily centers Robert Parish and Hakeem
Olajuwon. The contrast comes at shooting guard, where the East's
Hal Greer will try to muscle West scoring machine George Gervin.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I can't let him do,'' says Greer, ``is finger
roll.''
</P>
<P>
   At the tense pregame press conference, Auerbach promises only to
keep the ball in the hands of Jordan and Bird down the stretch,
while Wilkens plans a 12-minute fast break led by Johnson, Drexler,
Worthy, Baylor and Malone.
</P>
<P>
   Bellows public address announcer Michael Buffer, ``L-l-l-l-et's
Get Ready to Ruuuuummmmmbbblllllle!''
AND THE WINNER IS ...
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward to the fourth quarter, long after Bird swished his
final money ball to edge Maravich in the 3-point Shooting Contest,
Erving launched himself a toenail farther than Jordan to win the
Slam Dunk title and Chamberlain honored himself with a plaque
commemorating his 20,000th point.
</P>
<P>
   The score is tied 98-98, 36 seconds remaining and the West has
possession:
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Showtime,'' Riley says. ``Magic, feed the big guy.
Kareem, one more sky-hook. Nobody's stopped it yet this century.
And remember, no rebounds, no rings.''
</P>
<P>
   Though hounded by Frazier's trademark hand-check in the small of
his back, a smiling Johnson lobs a pass to Jabbar on the right low
block against Moses Malone. With Johnson and Robertson cutting
through the lane and Gervin and Baylor spotted-up on the 3-point
line, Abdul-Jabbar instead dribbles once and spins to his left for
a 16-foot sky-hook.
</P>
<P>
   Shoved one foot out of his automatic range by Malone's brute
force, the shot clangs off the front rim. Hayes momentarily grabs
the rebound, but is stripped in the lane by Robertson. After a wild
scramble that sends Malone and Johnson sprawling to the hardwood, a
bloodied Havlicek crawls from the scrum calling an East timeout
with :12 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   While Jackson frantically hums a Zen meditation and diagrams a
triangle and Daly screams about playing like ``Bad Boys,'' Auerbach
pulls something from his suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to light this damn cigar!'' Auerbach says calmly.
``Havlicek bring it up. Parish set a screen for Bird, and Larry,
bury it and let's get out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As usual,'' Bird shrugs.
</P>
<P>
   As Bird gets the ball on the wing, however, he is trapped by
Worthy and Pettit. Somehow, he dives and sneaks a pass through
Pettit's legs to Jordan, who finds himself isolated at the top of
the key against Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan waves off a Parish screen, then winks at teammates Bird,
Havlicek and Maravich, each finding an open area for a possible
game-winner. Tongue wagging, Jordan head-fakes Baylor into the air
with :05 on the clock. After two dribbles he is met in the lane by
Olajuwon and Robertson. After faking a handoff pass to a cutting
Bird, Jordan vaults backward toward the free-throw line, sending a
high-arcing fadeaway over four outstretched hands.
</P>
<P>
   Nine of the game's greatest players go crashing the boards as
the buzzer sounds. But their effort is wasted, as Jordan's
12-footer has swished through the basket to give the East a 100-98
victory and solidified his stature as the greatest player ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had to save my best for last,'' Jordan smiles while puffing on
Auerbach's stogie.
</P>
<P>
   Irritated on the floor by the trash-talking of Bird and Malone,
Johnson rushes the victory podium and whispers something in
Jordan's ear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Best two of three?''
</P>
<P>

RODMAN BRINGS DIFFERENT SHOWTIME TO L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the department store of sporting cliche, the Lakers have
dragged their game to that elusive ``next level.''
</P>
<P>
   And that level is Women's Wear.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, Dennis Rodman this and any other planet's foremost
rebounding mercenary is reportedly about to become part of a proud
tradition. Prepare for roll call: Baylor, West, Chamberlain,
Goodrich, Abdul-Jabbar, Johnson, Worthy, Nevitt (gotcha) ... and
Rodman. Adding the Worm to this crew would be about as historically
incongruous as carving the mug of Jerry Springer into Mount
Rushmore.
</P>
<P>
   The deciding factor may be that $3 million endorsement windfall
promised by Converse, a company that - in its association with
Rodman - has gone from Chuck Taylor to Rip Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   But is it the right move for the Lakers?
</P>
<P>
   Well, those poorly dressed men who seem to be twisting in agony
from having acid splashed on their faces are, in fact, local
sportswriters dancing (badly) in the streets. From an impurely
professional point of view, we are thrilled about the possibility
of Rodman joining the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, this rascal still threatens to play his last game in
the altogether, which should re-define the hackneyed concept of
``Showtime.''
</P>
<P>
   And if Dennis refuses to favor us with pithy post-game
commentary at the Great Western Bacon Cheeseburger Forum, we can
track him down at some grotesquely hip Hollywood saloon. If his
kamikaze-inspired comments sound a bit detrimental to crucial team
harmony, we can macarena on over to the table of Lakers owner Dr.
Jerry Buss for clarification.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. According to sources beyond our control, Rodman
and Buss get thirsty in the same neighborhood. According to
unrelated sources, Clippers owner Donald T. Sterling has been
touring Detroit-area taverns in an attempt to bump into Grant Hill.
Oh, the Rodman story is just dandy news for the Clippers, who get
less ink in an entire season than Dennis has etched into his skin.
</P>
<P>
   It also should be noted that having Rodman in the lineup means
Shaquille O'Neal may not be the sole fourth-quarter target of foul
play. Can Dennis stop Utah's Karl Malone on the ol' pick 'n' roll?
Gee, he might, if he decides to actually assist the teammate being
screened instead of hanging back to pad his rebounding stats.
</P>
<P>
   Does any of this mean we dance-challenged scribes will be
covering the NBA Finals? Truthfully, most of us would have been
more comfortable had the Lakers landed Tom Gugliotta, but when
Pavarotti's not available, you make a go of it with Little Richard.
</P>
<P>
   Who cares if Rodman's fondness for makeup earns him the title of
the NBA's first powder forward? He rebounds with more zeal - not to
mention panache - than anyone this side of ``Melrose Place.''
</P>
<P>
   And let's not forget something else Rodman brings to bear (or
bare). If the Lakers can't win the championship with O'Neal, Kobe
Bryant, Eddie Jones and the Worm, reporters won't look upon the
team's coach as good ol' Del Harris.
</P>
<P>
   He'll be Del Nino.
</P>
<P>
   ALL-STAR (FAST) BREAK
</P>
<P>
   Stupid's arrow remains jammed in the heart of Philadelphia,
where the lockout wrecked today's regularly scheduled all-star
game.
</P>
<P>
   Because the league has been up and running for only nine days,
it would be foolish to name an all-star team. So here goes:
</P>
<P>
   For the West, our forwards are Gugliotta and Chris Webber, who
deserves to be Player of the Week. Shaq gets the nod at center,
with Gary Payton at point guard and nobody at shooting guard. Oh,
we have to have a shooting guard? Well, since Bryant is playing
small forward, let's select Michael Finley of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   For the West, we begin and end with Hill (Grant) at small
forward. From there, it's a crapshoot, which explains why Michael
Jordan's retirement brings all of the intrigue over to the Western
Conference. OK, let's try any Hardaway and Atlanta's Steve Smith in
the backcourt, with Keith Van Horn at power forward and ... pick
your favorite Georgetown poison at center.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Shaq is the only center averaging 20 or more
points per game thus far.
</P>
<P>
   FREE ADVICE
</P>
<P>
   This space is reserved to saddle someone with the World B. Free
Award, presented (in spirit) to the NBA player who is making a name
for himself.
</P>
<P>
   This week's honoree is Sacramento rookie point guard Jason
Williams. Unless you were an NBA scout or some get-a-life
sportswriter named Hill who happened to catch Williams on ESPN2
last year before he (Williams, not Hill) was kicked off the Florida
team for using a joint on the pick 'n' roll, this guy was a just
rumor.
</P>
<P>
   What he has turned out to be is Bobby Hurley with far superior
size, quickness, jumping ability, passing instincts and shooting
skill. Otherwise, they're virtually the same player.
</P>
<P>
   MOVIES OF THE WEAK
</P>
<P>
   We would like to use this space to inform you that the coaching
lives of Mike Dunleavy and George Karl will be captured in a film
called ``You've Got Male-Pattern Baldness.'' But that would be a
lie.
</P>
<P>
   What we can tell you is the life of Clippers rookie Michael
Olowokandi may become a film project for DreamWorks, which has
something to do with Steven Spielberg and nothing to do with Hakeem
Olajuwon.
</P>
<P>
   Suggested titles: ``Citizen Kandi Cane'' or - exploiting the
crosstown-rival angle ``Kandi-Shaq.''
</P>
<P>
   SHOT-CLOCK VIOLATIONS
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota point guard Stephon Marbury is reported to be a
virtual lock to sign with Chicago before next season. Let's see.
He'd team up with Toni Kukoc and Brent Barry for a grand total of
three dribble-happy perimeter players, necessitating a change from
the triangle offense to the wreck-tangle offense. ... Six former
Celtics are NBA head coaches, but a former Celtic is not the coach
of the Celtics. ... Charles Barkley was fined $5,000 for making
``obscene comments'' to Forum fans. According to witnesses, Barkley
shocked and infuriated Lakers fans by accusing them of paying face
value for their tickets. ... Marv Albert is not yet in mid-season
form in his return to Knicks' broadcasts, but should be fine once
he gets a few kinks out. ... Latrell Sprewell's recent injury means
that, for two years in a row, he will be sidelined by an
unfortunate incident involving a heel. ... Speaking of P.J.
Carlesimo, how 'about them Warriors? ... Milwaukee's Ray Allen
dumped his agent and hired Johnnie Cochran to eyeball his new
contract offer. This does not mean the same strategy will be used
by Gary Payton, whose nickname is the ``Glove.''

GARDENS A FINAL LINK TO NHL'S PAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe it's the walk up Yonge Street, Toronto's eclectic
boulevard of people-watching that looks a little like a spilled bag
of Skittles.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's the pale, yellow bricks of the block-long building
that strike you when you turn onto Carlton Street, the same kind of
bricks they used in building your old elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's the smell of the hot dogs sold by the street vendors
or the steam from their carts or the simple doughnut shop and
pancake house that bustles with action across the street before and
after a game.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's the fact you can close your eyes and go back to a
time when people wore topcoats and hats to a hockey game, when the
working class could be distinguished by their short jackets and
Dickeys, when a cup of Joe and a doughnut cost about the same as a
seat in the Greys.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, just maybe, that's why last night's closing of Maple Leaf
Gardens is so emotional. You see, the old outdated building in the
heart of downtown Toronto has small seats, a maze of halls and a
serious lack of parking. But what was great about Maple Leaf
Gardens is it was our link to the past. A trip to the old building
took you back to 1931 or '45 or '57 or '66. Whenever you had fond
memories of youth, of sports, of a better life, that's what the
Gardens was _ your own personal time machine.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it seats less than 16,000 in cramped little uncomfortable
seats that weren't unlike your Aunt Doris' folding chairs, the ones
they made you sit in when you weren't big enough for the adult
table. But along with those small seats came an NHL bench that had
no walls. That's right, through the years, fans sat right next to
King Clancy or held the door so Maurice Richard could make a line
change. Gordie Howe rubbed elbows with the fans, so did Wayne
Gretzky. It was quite possibly the neatest seat in all of sports.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you couldn't get seats on the glass, you could sit
in the reds or blues or greys _ the seats really are those colors.
That's not all. The building is an inefficient rectangle _ with
seats climbing straight up a wall in each end zone. What's more,
the designers built it strangely high, almost twice as high as the
seats reach, giving it the real feel of a barn in which canvas was
draped from the ceiling for the spring dance.
</P>
<P>
   Maple Leaf Gardens is all that and more, a wonderfully
inconvenient, classically beautiful structure that simply could no
longer survive in the high-dollar business of hockey. The Air
Canada Centre is twice as big and twice as nice. Many in Toronto
say it'll make you forget the Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   But that would be a shame. The oldest building in hockey is now
the Pittsburgh Civic Arena, a futuristic design that looks far
newer than its 1961 birthdate. There are no more time machines
left.
Spotlight on Jaromir Jagr
Jagr's future not cemented, but role with Penguins solid
</P>
<P>
   The hair gets you right from the start _ either you love it or
you hate it.
</P>
<P>
   It has that kind of Michael Bolton-Fabio effect that gets people
to form an opinion almost immediately.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not how Jaromir Jagr should be taken. That would be
like slamming a cognac instead of sniffing it. No, the Pittsburgh
Penguins captain needs to be savored.
</P>
<P>
   Captain? That's right. You might have missed it, but Jagr was
named captain in the summer after center Ron Francis left for the
Carolina Hurricanes in free agency. Believe it, the long-haired,
insubordinate black sheep Jagr is running the show in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Kevin Constantine couldn't have made a better choice.
Jagr, who turns 27 tomorrow, has embraced his leadership and has
still not changed all that much. He doesn't like Constantine's
defensive system and isn't shy about saying so publicly. He
recently said an all-European team wouldn't have the right
``stuff'' to win the Stanley Cup. And he groused about a move onto
a line with the mostly inexperienced Jan Hrdina and Kip Miller.
</P>
<P>
   And after he griped and groused, Jagr went out and scored and
scored and scored _ enough to lead the NHL and take the Penguins on
a hot streak that has some believing they can win in the playoffs.
Now that's being a leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who else is going to do it?'' Jagr asks confidently. ``I know
I have to be that guy now. I was a troublemaker. When I wasn't
happy, I would scream. Now, I can't afford it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jagr has played so well, his team might not be able to afford
him. The Penguins are in bankruptcy, and Jagr is slated to make $9
million next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the owners and general manager think they have to trade me,
that's their decision,'' he said. ``I love to play in Pittsburgh.
If they can't afford me, then I would love to play in LA or New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   Ya gotta give the guy credit for honesty.
Quick hits
BARGAIN BASEMENT
</P>
<P>
   Here's the most outlandish statement you'll read in a while: The
Panthers got a bargain on Pavel Bure's new five-year, $47 million
deal.
</P>
<P>
   At $8, $9, $10, $10, $10 (all in millions, of course), Bure is
under contract for the long-term at a time when megastars Paul
Kariya and Eric Lindros will be negotiating new deals.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of Bure (for basically expendable players) and
the subsequent signing could be the deal of the NHL season for
Panthers general manager Bryan Murray.
JAWS ROAD TOUR
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks so far are taking on their league-record 10-game
roadtrip with the style of their coach, Darryl Sutter _ they're
chewing it up and spitting it out. So far, the Sharks are 3-2 on
the trip, including a 5-1 whipping of the Blues on Thursday.
NEW TECHNOLOGY
</P>
<P>
   Never let it be said that hockey is being left behind on the
technology front. Players every day are experimenting with carbon
fibers and and metal composites. The new gimmick is a stick with a
slightly bent neck where the shaft meets the blade. The principle
behind the technology is it puts your hands in better shooting
position.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, didn't that same technology fail in softball bats about 20
years ago.
TEAM IN TURMOIL
</P>
<P>
   Detroit has been known for cars and killings, and the climate
last week had some thinking the Red Wings might be involved in the
latter.
</P>
<P>
   Red Wings GM Ken Holland returned from winter meetings to find
coach Scotty Bowman had challenged his top players (Steve Yzerman,
Sergei Fedorov and Brendan Shanahan), combined them on the same
line and then chastised them when they didn't perform well. Fedorov
was most upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two of them have to work it out, and they will,'' Holland
said of Fedorov and Bowman. ``You don't win Stanley Cups in
February or March.''
</P>
<P>
   No, but you can lose them then.
PLENTY OF WIND
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Blackhawks coach Dirk Graham is resorting to the whip, a
move that will either shape up Chicago's moribund Blackhawks or
beat them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are desperate games and the efforts we've been getting
from some people are a joke,'' Graham said of his veterans,
including Tony Amonte and Chris Chelios. ``I think you've been
hearing the same story for the past three years. Nothing's
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch.
AROUND THE LEAGUE
</P>
<P>
   The five-game suspension of Coyotes tough guy Jim Cummins for
elbowing the head of Blackhawks' defenseman Brad Brown was the
NHL's first major suspension for a hit to the head in two months.
Is it just coincidence that the league's best players are having
their healthiest season? ... Add the Sabres to the list of teams
saying they're losing money. Even with a new building, Buffalo's
management claims potential losses of $15 million. ... So is this
good news or bad news? Lightning goalie Daren Puppa and his sore
back will not need surgery, a doctor said last week. However, they
still have no idea when he might be ready. Lightning coach/GM
Jacques Demers said Puppa is out of the picture in Tampa. ... When
the Flames stopped the Avalanche winning streak at 12 (sixth
longest in NHL history) it was the second time this season Calgary
had been a streak-stopper. The Flames also halted the Stars'
franchise best unbeaten streak at 15 games. What's more, the Flames
own three victories over the Red Wings. ... Blues goalie Grant Fuhr
is out 4-6 weeks after surgery on his right knee. The on-a-budget
Blues will wait until the summer to decide if they need goalie
help.
THE WEEK AHEAD
</P>
<P>
   Today: Flyers at Avalanche _ The two hottest teams in the NHL
meet for one of only two times this season. Thursday: Capitals at
Hurricanes _ A key battle in the Southeast Division, where maybe
only one team will make it to the playoffs. Saturday: Canadiens at
Maple Leafs _ A new beginning, the Air Canada Centre opens.

STARS DEFEAT KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By ROGER PHILLIPS &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; Long Beach Press-Telegram &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ This time, the rally fell short.
</P>
<P>
   Two nights after a dramatic last-second victory over
Philadelphia, the Kings spotted the Dallas Stars a two-goal lead
Saturday night, then started making like ``Comeback Kids'' once
again.
</P>
<P>
   They tied the score, and had the Forum crowd of 12,702 roaring.
</P>
<P>
   But a blown coverage by defenseman Rob Blake cost the Kings a
goal late in the second period, and the Stars made it stand for a
3-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never seem to panic or run around,'' said center Ray
Ferraro, who scored the Kings' first goal. ``If you dig yourselves
a hole, you've got a lot of work.''
</P>
<P>
   And it was a job the Kings could not complete, though they came
close in the third period. But an apparent power-play goal by
Donald Audette was disallowed with 13:04 to play, and the Stars
held on.
</P>
<P>
   Audette appeared to score on his own rebound, but the video goal
judge ruled that Audette, who stands 5-foot-8, had his stick above
his shoulders when he knocked the puck out of the air and into the
net.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I hit it good,'' Audette said, though replays
vindicated the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The news in the standings wasn't good for the Kings (20-30-4),
with an Edmonton victory again leaving them six points out of a
playoff berth with 28 games remaining. Dallas (32-10-8) improved to
3-0 against the Kings this season.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tough night for Blake. On Dallas' first goal, Brett
Hull scored when he fired the puck home after Blake had blocked the
initial shot. On the second, Blake was caught between Joe
Nieuwendyk, who centered the puck, and Pat Verbeek, who fired it
into the net.
</P>
<P>
   And on the game-winner, with 6:25 left in the second period,
Blake failed to check Guy Carbonneau in front, and Carbonneau
scored off a centering pass from Brent Severyn.
</P>
<P>
   When it was mentioned to Blake that he'd played more than 29
minutes, he said, ``It was 29 minutes too many for me, the way I
played.... I just got beat. (Carbonneau) passed by me and beat me
to the net. It's pretty simple.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Stars took their 2-0 lead, the Kings fought back with
the goals 40 seconds apart early in the second period by Ferraro
and Craig Johnson. But Dallas doesn't often blow two-goal leads,
and when the Stars regained the lead, they protected it as they
usually do so well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think they are in first place by mistake,'' said
Kings assistant coach Jay Leach, who spoke to reporters because
Coach Larry Robinson has laryngitis and left immediately after the
game. ``There are no riders on that team. For us, we had too many
fluctuations in our game to play consistent and beat a team like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings also were caught short on defense.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, the Kings announced that Steve Duchesne was ill
and would not play, and 10:49 into the game, Doug Bodger left with
bruised ribs.
</P>
<P>
   Then 8:04 into the second period, the Kings lost Sean O'Donnell
for 17 minutes when he received a fighting major, an instigating
minor and a 10-minute misconduct after a fight with Grant Marshall.
O'Donnell had skated past Marshall moments after Marshall had hit
him with a hard check.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of banged the glass with my stick (after being
checked),'' O'Donnell said. ``(Referee Kerry Fraser) thought that
me skating to (Marshall) was me trying to start a fight.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell said he'd simply been headed to the bench. Instead, he
and Marshall squared off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no intention of fighting,'' O'Donnell said. ``But I let
my emotions get the better of me.''

DE LA HOYA SHOWS HIS HEART
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 &HT;     By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ This wasn't how Oscar De La Hoya was supposed to
prove his greatness.
</P>
<P>
   He was supposed to dazzle Ike Quartey with his
once-in-a-lifetime skills, wear down the challenger and then knock
him out in the late rounds, or so many believed. Then, having
thrashed the fighter deemed his first serious challenge, he'd walk
away unmarked and seemingly invincible.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen that way. Not by a longshot.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, De La Hoya claimed his place among the best fighters of
his era with something that isn't learned over years in the gym _
his heart _ in what turned out to be an unforgettable battle of
wills that could've gone either way in the end.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth round, Quartey, who had just risen from the canvas
himself, knocked down De La Hoya with a right hand. As he got up,
it seemed as if he might be easy prey for the challenger. He was
hurt, his left eye was nearly closed and his confidence seemed
shaken.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the estimated 14,000 people present was thinking the
unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya's response? A display of inspiring courage.
</P>
<P>
   It took him a few rounds, but he shook off the effects of the
ill-fated sixth, dug in and seized victory.
</P>
<P>
   In the deciding rounds, the 10th, 11th and 12th, it was De La
Hoya who threw and landed more punches. It was De La Hoya who
seemed to have more energy. It was De La Hoya, not Quartey, who
decided he wasn't leaving the ring a loser.
</P>
<P>
   The final round will go down as one of the greatest in boxing
history.
</P>
<P>
   With the fight very much in doubt, De La Hoya landed his best
punch: A picture-perfect left hook that sent Quartey to the canvas
and brought the crowd to its feet for the remainder of the contest.
</P>
<P>
   What followed was sheer mayhem. The two stood in Quartey's
corner and exchanged blows at what might've been an unprecedented
pace until they both ran out of steam. De La Hoya got the better of
it and, his fans hoped, he did enough to win.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, De La Hoya won all three rounds on all cards
to claim a split-decision victory and retain his title.
</P>
<P>
   Again, it wasn't the fight many expected.
</P>
<P>
   But remember who Quartey is. He was !ital!not!off! an opponent
handpicked to make De La Hoya look good, as so many were in the
past. He was recognized as one of the best fighters in the world, a
ferocious power-puncher with excellent boxing skills and absolutely
no fear. In the eyes of many, he's a monster.
</P>
<P>
   That's what makes the manner in which De La Hoya won so
remarkable and so unforgettable.
</P>
<P>
   Had he won easily, he would've taken a monumental step in what
is turning out to be a monumental career.
</P>
<P>
   However, he wouldn't have made the statement he made on
Saturday. People admire sheer talent, which De La Hoya's certainly
has, but they cherish someone who can overcome adversity and emerge
victorious, as De La Hoya did so dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   When we look back on De La Hoya's career, we might look back on
this fight as the greatest in his career.

A CLOSE CALL FOR DE LA HOYA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT MORALES  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Anyone still wonder who the best welterweight in the
world is?
</P>
<P>
   In a thriller that indeed matched the Sugar Ray Leonard-Thomas
Hearns welterweight title bout in 1981, Oscar De La Hoya retained
his WBC welterweight title with a split decision over Ike Quartey
of Ghana on Saturday at the Thomas &AMP; Mack Center.
</P>
<P>
   Quartey won on Larry O'Connell's scorecard, 115-114, but De La
Hoya took the other two, 116-113 and 116-112, on the scorecards of
John Keane and Ken Morita, respectively. The 12th-round was one for
the books, and it was all De La Hoya, who flattened Quartey with a
wicked left hook early, then pulverized him on the ropes for 40
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Quartey, who fell to 34-0-1, somehow stayed on his feet. Referee
Mitch Halpern somehow restrained himself from stopping the bout.
But Quartey showed his mettle, and once De La Hoya ran out of gas,
Quartey even connected with a decent right hand coming off the
ropes.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya, 26, is now 30-0. He will meet Oba Carr on May 22 in
what will be his seventh defensive bout; Saturday night was his
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Although Quartey proved his worth, proved he had the better jab,
he didn't seem to fight enough to win some of the closer rounds. In
the first round, De La Hoya landed more punches, while blocking
many from Quartey, who was short on several jabs but did connect
with some in the final minute.
</P>
<P>
   The second round was a little of both fighters appearing
apprehensive to get in close. That is, until the last minute, when
Quartey got in a big right to De La Hoya's head. But De La Hoya
took it well and came back with a three-punch combination, with
Quartey finishing with a left.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya, of Whittier, Calif., scored with a two-punch
combination at the beginning of the third round, followed by a
left. Quartey scored with a big left hook in the waning moments of
the round, but De La Hoya returned fire again. Although it was a
left jab, De La Hoya connected with the bout's best punch to that
time when he snapped Quartey's head back in the fourth round.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, De La Hoya dropped Quartey with a big right-left
combination in the first 20 seconds. Quartey rose immediately and
came back quickly and put De La Hoya on the canvas with a left
uppercut.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya was up rapidly. Quartey, however, continued his
assault and had the better of the rest of the round, as he landed
more left jabs and left hooks. It appeared Quartey had won his
second consecutive round.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya seemed to get back on track in the seventh, though he
did not win the round convincingly. However, in the eighth round,
after having absorbed some punishment, De La Hoya staggered Quartey
with another powerful jab, again snapping back the challenger's
head.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya opened the ninth with a five-punch combination, then
quit throwing punches for some time. Quartey began to score with
his jab, although he also was short on several. De La Hoya
responded with a combination, but Quartey landed two rights.
</P>
<P>
   Quartey took the 10th round off, but De La Hoya did enough to
take it. A four-punch combination may have done it. De La Hoya,
whose left eye was swelling underneath at the end of the sixth
round, and Quartey did little in the 11th round, but the 12th round
was another story altogether.
</P>
<P>
   When De La Hoya connected with the big left hook, dropping
Quartey with a thud, it looked like De La Hoya might stop Quartey.
But Quartey, with heart to burn, was once again on his feet in just
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya went for the kill. During the long beating he gave
Quartey on the ropes before De La Hoya became tired, Quartey took
several more hard shots to the head.
</P>
<P>
   Twice Halpern edged toward the fighters, as if he was going to
stop it, but he pulled away. De La Hoya suddenly stopped punching,
and Quartey landed a light right.
</P>
<P>
   For a good part of the rest of the round _ almost two minutes _
De La Hoya walked around the ring with his hands at his sides, only
occasionally throwing a punch. Quartey, whose legs were wobbly,
didn't throw many more.
</P>
<P>
   One thing's for sure, if this one goes for a rematch somewhere
down the line, the sequel will have a difficult time matching up to
the first showing, but De La Hoya and Quartey could be the guys to
do it.

DE LA HOYA SHOWS HIS METTLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ The left eye was bruised and closing, and Oscar De
La Hoya was wobbling around the ring trying to keep his senses
intact in the sixth round Saturday night after he got decked by a
vicious left hook thrown by Ike Quartey.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the Golden Boy looked so vulnerable, so beatable, so
near to suffering a most humiliating setback.
</P>
<P>
   This was the most challenging moment of Oscar De La Hoya's
career that has been so glamorous and so free of such danger until
Quartey's punch bounced wickedly against his jaw.
</P>
<P>
   Could he survive?
</P>
<P>
   Could he stay in a vertical position against a fierce-punching
opponent not faintly reminiscent of any of his previous 29 victims?
</P>
<P>
   Could he emerge from such an ominous predicament and show that
he indeed is a fighter of legitimate greatness, as Rocky Marciano
once did with that thundering right hand that decked Jersey Joe
Walcott when it seemed Marciano was destined for failure, as Sugar
Ray Leonard once did with one eye closed shut when he dispensed a
miraculous rally against Thomas Hearns, as Ali did each time he
faced certain doom from the punishing fists of Joe Frazier?
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Oscar De La Hoya not only survived to earn a deserved
split 12-round decision over Quartey at the Thomas &AMP; Mack Center,
but did it with a flourish that earned him afterwards more respect
and praise than he did for all those easy victories against the
Julio Cesar Chavezes and Macho Camachos and Genaro Hernandezes and
all those other setups.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being handicapped the final six rounds with a badly
swollen eye that had to impair his vision, De La Hoya proved to be
even more aggressive than the too-cautious Quartey, even sending
Quartey sprawling to the canvas in a 12th round that he dominated
so thoroughly during the first two minutes that there were some
observers who thought the referee, Mitch Halpern, should have
stopped it.
</P>
<P>
   Wisely, Halpern didn't, and the equally heroic Quartey, who gave
the 26-year-old De La Hoya by far his most grueling test, was in
pursuit of De La Hoya for the final 60 seconds amid the
reverberating roar of the 16,000 spectators.
</P>
<P>
   What we found out about Oscar De La Hoya in this one is that his
heart is just as exceptional as his boxing skills which he used
adroitly throughout the evening, constantly beating his slower
opponent to the punch with his quick jabs and left hooks.
</P>
<P>
   What we found out about Oscar De La Hoya is that he can react
well in a crisis and isn't timid about mixing it up even when he
seems on the threshold unconsciousness.
</P>
<P>
   What we found out about Oscar De La Hoya is that he deserves to
be ranked among the best pound-for-pound fighters in the world and
that right now he is the best welterweight on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the other renowned practitioner in De La Hoya's
division, Felix Trindad, has never faced anyone as formidable as
Quartey, who fought heroically himself during a most competitive
fight.
</P>
<P>
   Two judges, Ken Morita (116-112) and John Keane (116-113), had
De La Hoya the clear winner, while another arbiter, Larry
O'Connell, had Quartey ahead by a 115-114 count.
</P>
<P>
   I had De La Hoya a 116-113 victor, scoring six rounds in his
favor, four for Quartey and calling two even in a match that wasn't
easy to tabulate because both men fought tactically and cautiously
for long periods of it.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, if Quartey had stepped up his attack in that sixth
round when he himself had risen from the canvas after being floored
by one of De La Hoya's left hooks, he might have been able to pull
off a most unexpected conquest.
</P>
<P>
   He had De La Hoya badly hurt, but didn't exactly displayed a
killer's instinct as he took his time and let the retreating De La
Hoya regain his composure.
</P>
<P>
   And in the fight's late stages, Quartey relaxed too often,
allowing De La Hoya to steal several rounds that he had no business
stealing considering the shape of his eye.
</P>
<P>
   The frenzied crowd was, as always, overwhelmingly in favor of De
La Hoya, who once again inspired a huge contingent of Hollywood
types to make appearances, including Jack Nicholson, who shows up
at more events than Magic Johnson, who, of course, was present and
would show up at a mall opening in Anchorage, Alaska, if he were
invited.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Arum was an animated presence at ringside, dripping with
pride over another successful De La Hoya promotion that that this
time actually had tense drama and excitement in it.
</P>
<P>
   There are dark rumors afloat that De La Hoya, with
behind-the-scenes cajoling from his financial adviser, Mike
Hernandez, might soon detach Arum and begin promoting his own
fights, a risky venture at best.
</P>
<P>
   All Arum has done is shrewdly choreograph De La Hoya's
professional career in a textbook perfect manner, from marketing to
matchmaking it so flawlessly that De La Hoya's private worth
exceeds $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   The talk on the street is that Hernandez, wealthy owner of an
East L.A. car dealership, thinks Arum is earning too much of the
profits generated by De La Hoya, and it's not a coincidence that
Arum consented to a 50-50 split in Saturday night's match.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, it seemed Oscar De La Hoya's fistic stock would take
a severe crash, but he reached into the deepest recesses of his
heart to somehow overcome Quartey.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   Ike Quartey never backed down.
</P>
<P>
   But neither did Oscar De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   Especially when he was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Especially when he seemed destined for serious trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Especially when it came time to prove that he is one special
fighter.

GREENE TIES WORLD RECORD
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Following his world-record performance in the men's 50 meters
Saturday night in the L.A. Invitational indoor track and field
meet, Maurice Greene showered the Sports Arena crowd of 6,005 with
T-Shirts which read: ``Something like a pheno-Mo-nom.''
</P>
<P>
   His start en route to his record run was nothing but phenomenal.
</P>
<P>
   Greene, 24, got off to a lightning start in the men's 50 meters
to win in a world-record-tying 5.56 seconds. Greene's time, which
equaled Canadian Donovan Bailey's 1996 standard, also dipped under
the American record of 5.61 seconds set by Andre Cason, and
eclipsed James Sanford's 1981 meet record of 5.62.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I say? Not too much,'' Greene said about his start.
``I knew from the gun nobody was going to catch me. In the 50
meters, it's reaction time, that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as Greene's coach John Smith put it: ``Well-timed.'' Either
way, Greene had already left a stellar field behind by 30 meters.
Jon Drummond and defending national 100-meter champion Tim Harden
finished well back in second and third in 5.63 and 5.67 but equaled
the eighth- and tenth-best performers of all time.
</P>
<P>
   ``His reaction was great because of the shortness of the race,''
Smith said. ``We're trying to take that finesse outdoors. It's like
going through the eye of a needle to get that composure. If he does
that, he can be the sprinter everybody wishes to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, the UCLA sprint coach who also coaches Drummond and 1997
World 200-meter champion Ato Boldon, called it Greene's best legal
start ever. Smith believes a similar start in the 100 meters by
Greene could result in taking down Bailey's 100 record of 9.84
seconds set in the 1996 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Greene came agonizing close after wind-aided efforts of
9.79 and 9.84 seconds. Greene said he felt capable of extending
Saturday's effort to a full 100 meters.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 50-60 meters, I am just getting started,'' Greene said.
``It hurt a little bit to not get the (100) record, but I have
dealt with it. I just have to be patient and everything will come
together. I am not worried about records. I am thinking about
running technically correct.''
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the women's 50-meter match race between Inger
Miller and Chryste Gaines went down to the wire. Miller squeaked by
Gaines in the final 10 meters to win, 6.15 to 6.16. Miller and
Gaines, members of the U.S. 1997 World Champion and American
record-setting 400-meter relay, moved into a tie for fifth and
seventh on the all-time U.S. list.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Morrison won the women's 50-meter hurdles in a
meet-record 6.81 to break Jackie Joyner-Kersee's 1996 record of
6.82 and become the second-fastest American of all-time.
</P>
<P>
   In the men's 50-meter hurdles, Reggie Torian, national 110-meter
high hurdles champion, defeated Mark Crear, the world's top-ranked
hurdler, to win in 6.43.
</P>
<P>
   Regina Jacobs, the American 5,000-meter record holder and
seven-time national 1,500-meter champion, stepped down to the 800
meters to win in 2:07.60.
</P>
<P>
   Derrick Adkins, the 1996 Olympic 400-meter intermediate hurdle
champion, turned back Tyree Washington to win the men's 500 yards
in 56.75. Jeff Hartwig, American record-holder in the pole vault,
turned back former record-holder Lawrence Johnson to win at 19-0\.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's Jess Strutzel was a surprise winner over four-time U.S.
Olympian Johnny Gray in the men's 800 meters. Strutzel held off a
furious surge from the 38-year-old American outdoor record holder
at the wire to win, 1:49.37 to 1:49.39.
</P>
<P>
   Other winners included Tisha Waller in the women's high jump at
6-3\ and Kevin Toth in the men's shot put at 66-5}.

CLUTCH WHEN IT COUNTED  
 CHAPMAN EARNS REDEMPTION IN OT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Just when the 19,023 fans at America West Arena were
starting to think Rex Chapman had turned into Mr. Klutz, he
returned to Mr. Clutch.
</P>
<P>
   After hitting only five of 19 shots in regulation, turning the
ball over five times and looking skyward for redemption a dozen
times, Chapman bailed the Suns out when they needed him most
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   He scored 12 of his 22 points in overtime and the Suns escaped
the Los Angeles Clippers _ barely _ 107-104.
</P>
<P>
   With the victory, the Suns (3-2) came out of a four-game
homestand with two wins and and face three games in three nights on
the road starting Monday night in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   After the Clippers' Lamond Murray, who led Los Angeles with 26
points, missed badly on the first shot of overtime, Chapman
connected with one of his patented runners from 14 feet. He added a
pair of free throws a moment later, then connected on his second
three-point basket of the game with 2:36 to go in the extra period
for a 100-93 Phoenix lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns, who blew a nine-point fourth quarter lead, nearly let
the Clippers survive again in the overtime. James Robinson's
three-point field goal with 1:40 remaining got the winless Clippers
(0-4) within two.
</P>
<P>
   It was still two with 45 seconds to go after Sherman Douglas's
running shot, but the Clippers were called for an illegal defense
with 29 seconds to go, and Chapman hit the resulting technical foul
free throw. The Suns had the ball and a three-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers were forced to foul, and Chapman missed the first
of two free throws with 27 seconds to go. But he made the second to
ice it.
</P>
<P>
   It was a terrific ending for what had been a long night for
Chapman, who has been struggling since returning from a hamstring
injury that caused him to miss training camp, the preseason and the
regular-season opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to Zeke's game for some pointers today,'' Chapman said,
referring to his 6-year-old son. ``His team won 40-16 and he had 28
(points). At halftime, it was 20-6. Zeke had 20. They wouldn't let
him play in the fourth quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Suns Coach Danny Ainge might have had similar thoughts about
Zeke's dad, but even on his worst nights, Chapman is the Suns best
player when defenses turn up the heat.
</P>
<P>
   And he came through in the overtime.
</P>
<P>
   But give forward Clifford Robinson an assist. He put the Suns in
position to win the game without an overtime or help from Chapman.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's defensive activity sparked the Suns going early at
the start of the fourth quarter, and he scored 14 of his 23 points
in the final period.
</P>
<P>
   A former NBA Sixth Man Award winner, Robinson started the first
three games at small forward. But Ainge moved him to the bench for
defensive purposes behind center Luc Longley and power forward Tom
Gugliotta.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson played all three front-line spots against the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns trailed by a point going into the fourth quarter, and
they were down two when Robinson converted a three-point play,
driving to the basket on Jason Kidd's feed and drawing a foul.
</P>
<P>
   That started a 22-11 Phoenix spurt that put the Clippers in a
nine-point hole with 3:41 to play in the game. It was still a seven
point lead with 1:52 to go, but the Suns let the Clippers off the
hook.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles closed to within one on Lamond Murray's jump shot
with 42 seconds to go. Kidd's driving layup attempt was blocked by
the Clippers' Lorenzen Wright, and Los Angeles had a chance to take
the lead with possession of the ball and 22.3 seconds on the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Gugliotta's foul sent Maurice Taylor to the free throw line
for two shots with 11.3 seconds to go, and Taylor tied it with his
first shot.
</P>
<P>
   But he missed badly on the second.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who finished with 25 points, made amends, hustling to
the other end to block Robinson's shot on a drive to the basket
with just over three seconds to go, and the game went to overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman went 0-6 in the first quarter and missed his first four
attempts in the second before finally hitting a three-point shot
with 6:05 to go in the first half. He curled off a screen to hit
another jump shot from about 18 feet with 7.8 seconds on the clock
that got the Suns within 45-44 at halftime.

DE LA HOYA EARNS SPLIT TO KEEP BELT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ It was a night worthy of an Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   For Oscar De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya survived Saturday night against Ike Quartey. Nothing
more. Nothing less. But nothing could be more telling. In the end,
fighters are defined by survival. It's not an ability. It's an
instinct.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody really knew whether De La Hoya was born with anything
more than good looks.
</P>
<P>
   Until Quartey.
</P>
<P>
   The African challenger forced him to get up, forced him to fight
with a welt that nearly closed his left eye and, in the end, forced
him to prove that he, too, had the instincts to be among boxing
greats.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya picked himself up after hitting the canvas for only
third time in his career to win a split decision over Ike Quartey
at Thomas &AMP; Mack Center.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya (30-0, 24 knockouts), still the World Boxing
Council's welterweight champion, was down in a wild sixth round,
just moments after he had floored Quartey (34-1-1, 29 KOs).
</P>
<P>
   In an equally wild 12th, De La Hoya knocked down Quartey, who in
the bout's final seconds fought desperately with his back to the
ropes and defeat on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   It was Quartey's last stand. One judge's card indicated it was a
worthy one.
</P>
<P>
   Larry O'Connell had Quartey leading by three points by three
points going into the final round. Despite the the 12th-round
knockdown, Quartey still was a 115-114 winner on O'Connell's card.
</P>
<P>
   But Quartey couldn't convince the other two judges. For Ken
Morita, it was De La Hoya, 116-112. For John Keane, it was also De
La Hoya, 116-113.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw the fight,'' Quartey said. ``The world saw the fight.
I knew I couldn't win a decision in Las Vegas. I thought I did
enough to win. I think I surprised him.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while, Quartey stunned him and scared more than 12,000 of
De La Hoya's adoring fans.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, it looked as though De La Hoya was in for
another easy victory. He looked sharp in the opening round with
body shots that punctuated the crisp jab that has always been the
fundamental skill in his repertoire.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Ouartey grinned, almost with contempt. If he
respected De La Hoya, it wasn't evident. But where there wasn't
respect, there was rust. Quartey hadn't fought in the 16 months
since he struggled to a draw with Jose Luis Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya decided to test him early in an apparent attempt to
see whether inactivity had eroded the African's skills. In the
second, it looked as if De La Hoya's decision would pay dividends.
He landed a right hand that rocked Quartey.
</P>
<P>
   The early moments belonged to De La Hoya. But the third round
did not. Quartey was considered dangerous, and, suddenly, he showed
why.
</P>
<P>
   He landed a big hook that momentarily seemed to hurt De La Hoya,
whose cheekbones already were beginning to redden from a jab that
landed with stinging precision and power.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, Quartey began to stage what looked like might end
in upset. But, first, he would hit the canvas. A big left hand from
De La Hoya put him there.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Quartey countered with an uppercut that put De La
Hoya on the seat of his black trunks.
</P>
<P>
   His left eye began to swell. His fans began to murmur.
</P>
<P>
   It was a complete departure from the moments before the opening
bell.
</P>
<P>
   The cheers for De La Hoya started early and lasted long. Before
the start of the third round in Oba Carr's bruising decision over
Frankie Randall, he appeared like a matinee idol on video screens
above the ring.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd erupted. Oscar was in the building.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Ike Quartey. Far from his native Ghana, he was a stranger
on a different continent. The boundaries, culture, people and
language belonged to DeLa Hoya. Only Oscar was spoken here.
</P>
<P>
   Quartey almost slipped into the ring unnoticed. He wore a gold
robe trimmed in the red and green of Ghana's national flag. A song
about a lion pounded on the speakers.
</P>
<P>
   But who was listening? Who cared? Quartey, the obscure
welterweight, was the invisible challenger as he danced a few
hesitant steps past a mariachi band that was waiting to serenade
the man who would step into the ring like a king unto his throne. &QL;

 CHAPMAN EARNS REDEMPTION IN OT

<P>
   PHOENIX - Just when the 19,023 fans at America West Arena were
starting to think Rex Chapman had turned into Mr. Klutz, he
suddenly returned to Mr. Clutch.
</P>
<P>
   After hitting only five of 19 shots in regulation, turning the
ball over five times and looking skyward for redemption about a
dozen times, Chapman bailed the Suns out when they needed him most
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   He scored 12 of his 23 points in overtime and the Suns escaped
the Los Angeles Clippers _ barely _ 107-104.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't normally like praying for shots to go in,'' Chapman
said. ``It was frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   But even with Chapman missing, there was little doubt he would
be on the floor at the end if the game's outcome was in question.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the kind of guy you don't give up on,'' said Suns Coach
Danny Ainge. ``He's huge for our team, and he showed it down the
stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   Chapman won so many games last season with late-game heroics,
``USA'' ``Today'' dubbed him the the new ``Mr. Clutch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to stick with him no matter how many shots he misses
until he's 50 years old,'' said Suns guard Jason Kidd. ``I know
he's going to make them sooner or later, and he'd do the same thing
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   With the victory, the Suns (3-2) came out of a four-game
homestand with two wins and now face three games in three nights on
the road starting Monday night in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   And they probably never should have needed overtime to get by
the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns led by nine in the fourth quarter and still had a
seven-point lead with 1:52 to go after Chapman hit a jump shot on
an assist from Kidd.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clippers reeled off seven points in the final 1:07, with
Maurice Taylor sending it to overtime by hitting one of two free
throws with 11.3 seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   After the Clippers' Lamond Murray, who led Los Angeles with 26
points, missed badly on the first shot of overtime, Chapman
connected with one of his patented runners from 14 feet and the
game was on.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   It was a terrific ending for what had been a long night for
Chapman, who has been struggling since returning from a hamstring
injury that caused him to miss training camp, the preseason and the
regular-season opener.
</P>
<P>
   He went to watch his 6-year-old son Zeke play earlier for
inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to Zeke's game for some pointers today,'' he said.
``His team won 40-16 and he had 28 (points). At halftime, it was
20-6. Zeke had 20. They wouldn't let him play in the fourth
quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Ainge might have had similar thoughts about Zeke's dad, but even
on his worst nights, Chapman is the Suns best player when defenses
turn up the heat. Shawn Respert played most of the fourth quarter,
and played well. But Ainge went back to Chapman.
</P>
<P>
   And he came through in the overtime.
</P>
<P>
   But give forward Clifford Robinson an assist. He put the Suns in
position to win the game without an overtime or help from Chapman.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's defensive activity sparked the Suns going early at
the start of the fourth quarter, and he scored 14 of his
season-high 23 points in the final period.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to give the Clippers credit,'' Robinson said.
``They're a good young team, and they fought hard. We just made a
few more plays at the end. Rex hit some big shots for us in
overtime, and we pulled it out.''
</P>
<P>
   All the Suns have been trying to keep Chapman loose during his
struggles, a nd Robinson couldn't resist one jab.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took enough shots, he should have been able to get the
cobwebs out,'' Robinson said, laughing.

BURKE ANTICIPATES BIG LOSS ON COYOTES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Coyotes will lose $10 million this season,
according to owner Richard Burke, who is expecting total financial
losses of at least $50 million by the time the NHL team's lease
expires at America West Arena in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, we've got to remain highly competitive just to stay
alive until then,'' said Burke, who is trying to eventually pull
out of the downtown arena and build a 20,000-seat hockey arena in
south Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   Burke contends the Coyotes' lease arrangement at the arena, with
its obstructed-view seats and limits on revenues to be made at the
site, makes the red ink inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Burke said Saturday that the hard cash losses likely will
preclude General Manager Bobby Smith from actively seeking a
high-priced player by next month's trading deadline. He also said
the team will make only a ``minor dent'' in lost revenues if the
Coyotes advance beyond the first round of the playoffs for the
first time in 12 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to lose a huge amount of money again this year, an
unaffordable amount, really, over the long term,'' Burke said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That being said, we have the sixth-lowest payroll in the
league and, as (NHL) Commissioner (Gary) Bettman pointed out, we
have more wins per dollars-spent than anybody in the league. That's
a real credit to the front office. Plus, we're 25th in non-payroll
expenses (the third-lowest in the 27-team NHL), which is a tribute
to the other half of the front office (for keeping spending
down).''
</P>
<P>
   In a change from comments made Thursday night, Burke said
Saturday that he has no plans to move the team out of the state,
regardless of the outcome of the proposed $624 million Los Arcos
Mall redevelopment plan, which would feature a 20,000-seat hockey
arena for the team, in addition to a conference, retail and
entertainment complex on 92 acres at Scottsdale and McDowell roads.
</P>
<P>
   A public referendum on the project is scheduled for a May 18
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm comfortable it will get done,'' Burke said. ``I have been
from the first time we looked at it. The reasons are the same now
as then. One, it's the right place to put it. This is a piece of
commercial property, an arena, that will make the project good for
everybody _ the community, our fans, the city of Scottsdale and
us.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Burke had mentioned ``Plan B'' _ considering a move
out of state _ if the referendum didn't go the Coyotes' way.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a Plan B. This is it,'' Burke said Saturday. ``We
don't have any expectations that it isn't going to work. We are not
going to look elsewhere. We're committed to being here.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke said about 40 percent of the $10 million in losses the
Coyotes are bracing for is directly related to the loss of revenue
from 4,500 sight-obstructed seats at America West Arena, which sell
for about $10 apiece. Hockey capacity at the arena is 16,210.
</P>
<P>
   Burke blames himself and Jerry Colangelo, the city-appointed
landlord of the arena who lured him to Phoenix. He said Colangelo
was not truthful about the number of quality seats for ice hockey
at the arena. He also said his group should have done a better job
of checking it firsthand before signing a five-year lease agreement
there after purchasing the Winnipeg Jets and moving them to Phoenix
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their financial shortcoming off the ice, the Coyotes
have cruised to the second-best overall record in the Western
Conference and are challenging Dallas and Philadelphia for best
record overall. However, Burke said fans probably can forget about
the club going after a superstar like Calgary's Theo Fleury before
the trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby's put together a strong team and I think we're as good
as anybody,'' said Burke, whose club improved to 29-13-10 with a
4-1 victory Saturday over red-hot Colorado. ``But (trading for a $4
million-$6 million player) is not realistic. There simply are
limits in our case.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if Bob needs to make a responsible move at the trading
deadline to get this team over the top, I've told him he can do it.
That doesn't mean taking on somebody with a $5 million salary. But
if it's something reasonable, my guess is he'll do it.'' &QL;

ROBINSON, MANNING STAR IN SUNS' 6TH MAN ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The NBA may have to change its Sixth Man Award to something
different, like the Sixth Men Award.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns have last season's Sixth Man winner,  &UR; Danny Manning.
And another Suns forward,  &UR; Clifford Robinson, won the same award
for the 1993 season.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson started the first three games this season at small
forward, but Suns Coach  &UR; Danny Ainge moved him to the bench to
provide defense and scoring behind center  &UR; Luc Longley and power
forward  &UR; Tom Gugliotta.
</P>
<P>
   And Manning also is coming off the bench while recuperating from
a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was particularly instrument in the Suns 107-104
overtime victory against the Clippers. He scored 14 of his 23
points in the fourth quarter to help the Suns build a nine-point
lead in regulation that the Clippers ultimately overcame to force
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to knock down the shots when I had open
opportunities and be more aggressive when I had the ball,''
Robinson said. ``The last couple of games, I haven't been as
aggressive as I usually am. I was just trying to make things
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   He started it with his defensive play, and guarded three
different front-line positions at different times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danny (Ainge) told me he might have me guard five different
guys, so be ready,'' Robinson said. ``I'm always going to be ready
to play defense. That's part of my game. I wouldn't feel
comfortable being out there and not being a force on defense.'' &QL; 
McCloud out &QL; 
Forward  &UR; George McCloud missed the game after his sprained right
ankle failed to respond well enough to treatment. Ainge said it
wasn't just a precaution to get McCloud ready for a
three-games-in-three-nights trip that starts Monday in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might not even play in the next three games,'' Ainge said.
``It's that sore. I don't think it's a two-week type of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   With McCloud out, Ainge started  &UR; Chris Morris at small forward
because he wants to keep Robinson and Manning in their roles off
the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Morris responded with seven points and five rebounds in only 15
minutes. &QL; 
Kandi Man &QL; 
 &UR; Michael Olowokandi, the first player taken in the 1998 NBA draft,
made his first career start for the Clippers and finished with nine
points and seven rebounds in 34 minutes. He got into early foul
trouble and wasn't much of a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted Michael in there because (the Suns) start Luc
(Longley) at that spot,'' said Clippers Coach  &UR; Chris Ford. ``It
would be easier for him to guard Luc.''
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi said nothing has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because I was starting didn't mean that I was going to
play more of a role,'' he said. ``It was mainly to match up against
Longley.''

QUARTEY PUTS UP A FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ In the end, the man who wanted to win more did.
</P>
<P>
   At the finish of a close and painful confrontation, Oscar De La
Hoya dropped his relentless challenger, Ike Quartey, with a
crushing left hook to the chin in the opening seconds of the 12th
round, sending the former World Boxing Association champion
skidding on the seat of his pants into the ropes and skidding over
the cliff of defeat.
</P>
<P>
   When Quartey got up, De La Hoya went after him with a relentless
fury, pinning him on the ropes and bombing him with at least 20
unanswered punches. Quartey refused to go down again but he was out
on his feet, wobbling back into the ropes in search of an emergency
exit no boxing ring contains.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time he was done, so was De La Hoya, who had punched
himself out in a furious search for the knockout that might have
quieted all of his critics and had nothing left to finish his
challenger with. Both spent the final minute of one of the best
welterweight fights in years walking around without punching, a
quiet concession that each had spent all his armaments in the
effort to win the World Boxing Council welterweight title.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, De La Hoya (30-0) won a split decision, with judge
Larry O'Connell of England having Quartey a 115-114 winner while
John Keane, also of England, had De La Hoya winning, 116-113, and
Ken Morita of Japan had De La Hoya a 116-112 victor. The Globe card
also had De La Hoya in control, 116-112.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, Quartey (34-1-1) claimed the usual fiction that he
had won, saying, ``You saw the fight. You know I won the fight, but
you knew I couldn't win a decision in Las Vegas.''
</P>
<P>
   Quartey gave De La Hoya his toughest 36 minutes in the ring, a
battle that led the champion to say he had no interest in a
rematch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' De La Hoya said. ``There are bigger and
better fights out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Also easier ones, as De La Hoya surely knows.
</P>
<P>
   Quartey's jab immediately began to redden De La Hoya's face, but
the champion retaliated with some solid body shots that left
Quartey smiling and unmoved. The fight remained a cat-and-mouse
game until Quartey hit him with a solid right hand late in Round 2
that De La Hoya answered with a toe-to-toe confrontation that
Quartey won at the bell.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya finally made his presence felt late in the third
round when he landed a blistering left-right combination that took
the smile off Quartey's face and kept his punches well short of the
mark for the next 45 seconds. Late in that stanza Quartey dropped a
hard right and a harder left on De La Hoya and the champion quaked
for an instant, but he came back in Round 4 and had Quartey
retreating.
</P>
<P>
   Quartey had openings late in the next round to land two right
hands but was short with both. Round 6 proved De La Hoya's
prediction that both men could do damage was true when he dropped
Quartey with a left hook seconds in, then grew too bold and was
dropped by a Quartey left hook after De La Hoya missed with an
uppercut.
</P>
<P>
   Quartey's powerful jab and hammering right had begun to do
damage to the champion's face, which no longer had the Golden Boy
looks. By Round 9, De La Hoya's left cheek was turning blue and his
nose was swollen, but the fight remained close because De La Hoya
was busier longer, even though it was clear Quartey's heavy punches
were more effective.
</P>
<P>
   Quartey landed his best punch of the fight late in Round 9 when
he blasted home a right hand that snapped the champion's head back.
But when De La Hoya returned fire the next round with a solid
combination, Quartey backed off and did not come forward again.
</P>
<P>
   His slowing pace would continue until he ran into the blistering
punch that dropped him a second time. That one will be the punch
fight fans remember and Ike Quartey would like to forget.

DE LA HOYA SHOWS HIS HEART
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ This wasn't how Oscar De La Hoya was supposed to
prove his greatness.
</P>
<P>
   He was supposed to dazzle Ike Quartey with his
once-in-a-lifetime skills, wear down the challenger and then knock
him out in the late rounds here Saturday, or so many believed.
Then, having thrashed the fighter deemed his first serious
challenge, he'd walk away unmarked and seemingly invincible.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen that way. Not by a longshot.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, De La Hoya took a giant step toward superstardom with
something that isn't learned over years in the gym _ his heart _ in
what turned out to be an unforgettable battle of wills that
could've gone either way in the end.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth round, Quartey, who had just risen from the canvas
himself, knocked down De La Hoya with a right hand. As he got up,
it seemed as if he might be easy prey for the challenger. He was
hurt, his left eye was nearly closed and his confidence seemed
shaken.
</P>
<P>
   Each and everyone in a packed Thomas &AMP; Mack Center, almost all
on the side of De La Hoya, was thinking the unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya's response?
</P>
<P>
   A display of inspiring courage. As he said afterward in a
monumental understatement _ ``I'm no quitter'' _ and set about
proving it.
</P>
<P>
   It took him a few rounds, but he shook off the effects of the
ill-fated sixth, dug in and seized victory in a way that would've
made the greatest ring warriors in history proud.
</P>
<P>
   In the deciding rounds, the 10th, 11th and 12th, it was De La
Hoya who threw and landed more punches. It was De La Hoya who
seemed to have more energy. It was De La Hoya, not Quartey, who
decided he wasn't leaving the ring a loser.
</P>
<P>
   The final round will go down as one of the greatest in boxing
history.
</P>
<P>
   With the fight apparently in doubt, De La Hoya landed his best
punch: A picture-perfect left hook that sent Quartey to the canvas
and brought the crowd to its feet for the remainder of the contest.
</P>
<P>
   What followed was sheer mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   The two stood in Quartey's corner and exchanged blows for what
seemed to be a solid minute until they both ran out of steam. De La
Hoya got the better of it and, his fans hoped, he did enough to
win.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, De La Hoya won all three rounds on all cards
to claim a split-decision victory and retain both his title and
perfect record (30-0).
</P>
<P>
   Again, it wasn't the dominating performance we've come to expect
from De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   But remember who Quartey is. He was !ital!not!off! an opponent
handpicked to make the champion look good, as so many were in the
past. He was recognized as one of the best fighters in the world, a
ferocious power-puncher with excellent boxing skills and absolutely
no fear.
</P>
<P>
   In the eyes of many, he's a monster. And he looked it on
Saturday. No one stands up to the Golden Boy the way he did unless
he, too, has uncommon courage.
</P>
<P>
   That's what makes the manner in which De La Hoya won so
remarkable and so unforgettable.
</P>
<P>
   Had he won easily, he would've taken a monumental step in what
is turning out to be a monumental career.
</P>
<P>
   However, he wouldn't have made the statement he made on
Saturday. People admire sheer talent, which De La Hoya certainly
has, but they cherish someone who can overcome adversity against a
worthy adversary and emerge victorious, as De La Hoya did so
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, De La Hoya hasn't risen to the level of a Roberto
Duran or a Sugar Ray Leonard. All the ingredients are there,
though: The God-given ability, more experience with every fight
and, perhaps most important, the guts.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, he has great performances in his future. Fighters
like Felix Trinidad, like Jose Luis Lopez, like Fernando Vargas or
like David Reid probably will bring even more out of De La Hoya.
After all, he's only 26 years old.
</P>
<P>
   But it's going to be difficult to top Saturday, the night De La
Hoya chose victory over defeat. When we look back on De La Hoya's
career, it might be his defining triumph. &QL;

BRUINS SINK DEEPER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia _ The good ship Boston Bruins is
taking on water.
</P>
<P>
   After a shutout victory in Edmonton Tuesday night, the Bruins
appeared in decent shape at one game above .500. That all changed
in a hurry as the team suffered back-to-back losses to Calgary
Friday and the Vancouver Canucks, 3-1, Saturday night at GM Place.
After falling to two of the worst teams in the Western Conference,
the Bruins are back to one game under .500 with a sorry road mark
of 9-15-3.
</P>
<P>
   As troubling as their subpar play is, injuries also are
mounting. The Bruins lost defenseman Darren Van Impe to a shoulder
separation Tuesday night, left wing Sergei Samsonov to a charley
horse Friday and Saturday night, checker P.J. Axelsson sprained his
right wrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The score probably should've been more than what it was,''
said coach Pat Burns, who had little to say after the disappointing
defeat. ``We weren't that much in the game. We circled the wagons
for a while, but we just didn't have enough elements tonight to put
on a better fight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins didn't come out nearly as confident as they had a
night earlier in Calgary. They struggled mightily in their own end
and were very fortunate to be tied, 1-1, heading into the first
intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Mogilny, who has endured a prolonged scoring slump
this season, put the Canucks on the board at 7:16 with his sixth
goal of the year. Mogilny, who had gone into the game with one goal
in 21 games, took a pass from Dave Gagner and fired a quick wrister
from the left circle that sailed over goalie Rob Tallas.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins actually received a huge assist from Vancouver in
scoring their goal on the power play. Anson Carter tried to send a
backhand pass across to Joe Thornton. Fortunately for Boston,
Canucks defenseman Bryan McCabe swept his stick across and put the
puck into his own net past goalie Garth Snow to tie the game at the
11-minute mark.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver, playing without captain Mark Messier (knee injury)
and defenseman Ed Jovanovski (broken foot), outshot the Bruins,
10-5, in the period with several decent scoring opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The Canucks took the lead early in the second period on a truly
astonishing goal by left wing Todd Bertuzzi, likely to be seen on
highlights for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   The mammoth forward _ listed at 6 feet 3 inches, 230 pounds,
took a pass from defenseman Mattias Ohlund and skated through
virtually the entire Boston lineup on his way to the net. Just
before arriving, he met up with defenseman Hal Gill and stiff-armed
Gill to the ice, kept control of the puck, and smacked a forehand
shot into the top corner for the 2-1 advantage at the 33-second
mark. It was the fourth goal in the last five games for Bertuzzi,
whom the Canucks are hoping will take up the offensive slack with
Messier out a month or more.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins lost Axelsson for a time in the middle period when he
was pitchforked into the boards by former Bruin Jamie Huscroft at
2:48. Axelsson returned later, playing a total of five shifts in
the period, but left again and didn't play in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Boston had its chances in the second, the best a point-blank
shot by Carter after he took a centering pass from Antti Laaksonen
at 11:48 on the power play, but Snow turned it away. The Bruins'
fortunes took a turn for the worse early in the third when center
Dave Scatchard converted a Bill Muckalt rebound at 4:38. Tallas
stopped Muckalt's bid but Scatchard put a backhander through his
legs for the 3-1 lead.

CLOSE CALL FOR DE LA HOYA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT MORALES  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Oscar De La Hoya wondered if Ike Quartey was good
enough to stand up to a man who would stand up to him.
</P>
<P>
   Quartey was able to stand up to De La Hoya on Saturday, but not
enough to dethrone a man who now could be considered the best in
the world, pound-for-pound, even by those who have refused to adorn
him with that label.
</P>
<P>
   In a thriller that indeed matched the Suqar Ray Leonard-Thomas
Hearns welterweight title bout in 1981, De La Hoya retained his WBC
welterweight title with a split decision over Quartey of Ghana on
at the Thomas &AMP; Mack Center.
</P>
<P>
   Quartey won on Larry O'Connell's scorecard 115-114 but De La
Hoya took the other two, 116-113 and 116-112, on the scorecards of
John Keane and Ken Morita, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The 12th-round was one for the books, and it was all De La Hoya,
who flattened Quartey with a wicked left hook early, then
pulverized him on the ropes for 40 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Quartey, who fell to 34-0-1, somehow stayed on his feet. Referee
Mitch Halpern somehow restrained himself from stopping the bout.
But Quartey showed his mettle, and once De La Hoya ran out of gas,
Quartey even connected with a decent right hand coming off the
ropes.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya, 26, is now 30-0. He will meet Oba Carr on May 22 in
what will be his seventh defensive bout; Saturday night was his
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want action-packed fights, and I gave it to them,'' De
La Hoya said. ``He was a very tough opponent. He gave me a good
fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Quartey was bitterly disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won the fight,'' he said. ``You saw the fight, the world saw
the fight. You saw the decision. I thought I did enough to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I knew I couldn't win a decision in Las Vegas. You have to
respect Oscar. He is the champion, but I thought I did enough to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps boxing analyst Gil Clancy said it best regarding De La
Hoya's performance, in which he showed he can take a big punch from
a big hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the greatest welterweight title fights I've
ever seen,'' Clancy said. ``Oscar proved he is a great champion.''
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of punches landed in the first five rounds,
but the real fireworks didn't begin until the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya dropped Quartey with a right-left combination within
the first 20 seconds of the round. Quartey was up quickly, then
flattened De La Hoya with a left uppercut. De La Hoya also rose
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   But Quartey continued the assault and won the round by landing
some of his hard jabs and a couple of rights.
</P>
<P>
   Quartey applauded De La Hoya's ability to take his best punches.
</P>
<P>
   ``That did not surprise me,'' Quartey said. ``He is a champion
and he came to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Said De La Hoya: ``This guy hits hard. He is a very powerful
puncher. But I said to myself, `Hey, I'm going to come right back.'
I'm no quitter. I proved to the world I can go up against the very
best.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya seemed to get back on track in the seventh, though he
did not win the round convincingly. However, in the eighth round,
after having absorbed some punishment, De La Hoya staggered Quartey
with a powerful jab, snapping back the challenger's head.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya opened the ninth with a five-punch combination, then
quit throwing punches for some time. Quartey began to score with
his jab, although he also was short on several. De La Hoya
responded with a combination, but Quartey landed two rights.
</P>
<P>
   In the twelfth, De La Hoya connected with the big left hook,
dropping Quartey with a thud, and it looked like De La Hoya might
stop Quartey. But Quartey, with heart to burn, was once again on
his feet in just seconds.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya went for the kill. During the long beating he gave
Quartey on the ropes before De La Hoya became tired, Quartey took
several more hard shots to the head.
</P>
<P>
   Twice Halpern edged toward the fighters, as if he were going to
stop it, but he pulled away. De La Hoya suddenly stopped punching,
and Quartey landed a light right.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 12th round I was surprised Ike was didn't go down
again,'' De La Hoya said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Clancy: ``I was worried that Oscar was going to kill him.
He landed some left hooks that I have never seen anybody be able to
take.''
</P>
<P>
   Quartey was not convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did everything,'' he said. ``Oscar did nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Dino Duva, Quartey's promoter, said Quartey's reaction is
normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ike is very upset,'' Duva said. ``He thought he won the fight.
After a war like that, he has the right to be upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, De La Hoya laid claim to best in the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' he said, ``I am the best pound-for-pound fighter in the
world.'' &UR; !end! &QL;

KWAN COASTS TO TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
 FIGURE SKATING-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Maybe she should have just mailed in her
practice tapes from Lake Arrowhead and saved on the airfare. Nobody
but Michelle Kwan was going to beat Michelle Kwan here Saturday
night _ and nobody did.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't really matter who I compete against,'' the
18-year-old Kwan shrugged after she'd blown away 13-year-old Naomi
Nari Nam and Angela Nikodinov inside the Delta Center to win her
third US women's figure skating title in four years. ``It was just
one of those performances where you just went out there and let it
go. It didn't matter what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody since Jill Trenary (1987, 89-90) had won three crowns and
this one was never in doubt. With Olympic gold medalist Tara
Lipinski gone pro and former champion Nicole Bobek absent with an
ovarian ailment, Kwan's main challengers were middle schoolers.
Probably not since 1975, when Dorothy Hamill defeated Wendy Burge
and Kath Malmberg, had a defending titlist faced less of a
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Kwan saw it that way. ``I don't think I'm dominating
skating in any way,'' she insisted, even though she hasn't lost an
event since the Olympics. ``You never know who's going to come up.
You know there are people out there. You always have to keep on top
of your game and keep improving. Because you never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Kwan knew about Nam, the 4-foot-6-inch dervish who resembles the
Kwan of five years ago. ``Adorable,'' declared Kwan. ``Very cute.''
She knew about the 18-year-old Nikodinov, who'd been fifth last
year. And she knew about Sarah Hughes, the US junior champion who
finished fourth here.
</P>
<P>
   Making the team for next month's world championships in Helsinki
was a dream for Hughes, an impossibility for Nam. Though
13-year-olds are banned from the worlds, where the minimum age is
15, Hughes gets to go because she's a world junior medalist.
</P>
<P>
   So even though Nam finished second, she stays home. And she'll
stay home again next year unless she can make the world junior
podium. ``It's a deplorable instance of age discrimination,'' said
John A.W. Nicks, Nam's coach.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for Nam, who fell in Thursday's short program, whacking
her head on the ice and straining her neck, it was enough to skate
cleanly Saturday night and steal the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sort of nervous, but I just had to block it out of my
mind and not think about what I did Thursday,'' said Nam, who was
skating in the novices only two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Though Nam had the easiest program among the contenders _ only
five triple jumps and no lutz among them _ she zipped through it
with grace and verve and brought the crowd to its feet with the
night's most rousing ovation. ``I just wanted to stay out there,''
said Nam. ``I wish I could just stop time and freeze.''
</P>
<P>
   The only question after that was whether Nikodinov could climb
out of sixth place and grab the third spot for Helsinki. She was
far from stellar, breaking off a combination and doubling a triple
lutz. But it was enough to vault her past Hughes and 16-year-old
Erin Pearl of Scarborough, Maine, who performed nicely in her
senior debut.
</P>
<P>
   That was the only suspense on a night that Kwan owned merely by
showing up. She had breezed through the year, winning six open
events including the world professional title, and came here as the
heaviest women's favorite in two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Once she landed her triple lutz combination and the triple
toe-triple toe that she hadn't tried in two years, Kwan was off and
winging. By the time she flopped on her triple lutz near the end,
they already were getting another gold medal ready.
</P>
<P>
   For Kwan, this was merely a dress rehearsal for the 2002
Olympics, which will be held in the same building. ``I didn't get a
chance to skate in Nagano before the Olympics,'' she said. ``It's
good to know my way around the place.''

LOOK FOR DODGERS IN CACTUS LEAGUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It really wasn't that long ago that the Cactus League was
basically on a respirator. There was growing talk of every club
moving its spring training headquarters to Florida, where many
cities were making pitches to lure the eight clubs that trained in
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's moving from Tucson to Florida after the 1992 Cactus
League season was seen as a possible start of the migration to the
Sunshine State. Thankfully, those ideas quickly disappeared thanks
to some forward-thinking people who decided to revamp the spring
training landscape in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's addition of the Maryvale complex, home to the
Milwaukee Brewers, was the latest in a series of renovations and
new stadiums being built in the state. In recent years, Arizona has
seen a new complex built in Peoria (home to Seattle and San Diego),
Tucson (home to the Diamondbacks and White Sox), Scottsdale
(Giants) and complete renovations done in Mesa (Cubs), Tempe
(Angels) and Phoenix (Athletics).
</P>
<P>
   In Anaheim's  &UR; Mo Vaughn and Colorado Manager  &UR; Jim Leyland, two
giants in the game will arrive for their first Cactus League spring
this year. But those two will pale in comparison if the Cactus
League is able to lure the biggest name ever next year.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus is that the Los Angeles Dodgers will finally make
the financially sound move to relocate their spring training from
Vero Beach, Fla., to the Valley, probably in Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   With that move will come yet another new spring complex and the
belief that other clubs may follow in the years to come. All of
which would be great news to baseball fans in Arizona. &QL; 
Short-term memory loss? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Former Diamondbacks starter  &UR; Willie Blair, last seen with a 4-15
record the day he was traded to the New York Mets on July 31, seems
happy and content to be back in Detroit, where he enjoyed his
finest season in 1997, winning 16 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't expect it would happen, though,'' Blair said
of his off-season trade from the Mets to the Tigers. ``I was very
surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair emphasized that his leaving Detroit last year had
everything to do with economics. Arizona offered Blair a three-year
deal worth $11.5 million, while Detroit came in at $10 million for
the same length.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anyone faced with that decision would have made the
same one I did,'' Blair said.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's financial situation may have been set up in Arizona, but
little else. He started the season 0-7 and it soon looked like he
was headed toward becoming a rare 20-game loser.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got to be a joke among our pitchers,'' Blair said. ``If I
didn't throw a shutout, I didn't win the game. My numbers were bad,
but they were deceiving.''
</P>
<P>
   True, the Diamondbacks offense was near the bottom in the
league, but that doesn't mean he got jobbed every time out. In his
four victories, the D-Backs averaged nearly eight runs per game.
However, Blair did allow at least five runs in nine starts. And his
27 home runs allowed came in just 23 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Detroit, I was a lot more relaxed because the Tigers were
scoring some runs for me and I got on a roll. But with Arizona,
every pitch I made was the biggest pitch in the game.'' &QL; 
Trivial question &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's pretty much a no-brainer to know Baltimore's  &UR; Cal Ripken
has played the most games in the 1990s. Ripken enters this season
having played 1,389 games this decade. Who is next on the list? &QL; 
Trivial answer &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Texas first baseman  &UR; Rafael Palmeiro, who will start the season
having played in 1,368 games this decade. Palmeiro, a teammate of
Ripken's the last five years who has never been on the disabled
list, has missed only 22 games in the 1990s. &QL; 
THE HIT LIST &QL; 
 &UR; The time's they are definitely
 &UR; a-changing: For the first time since their days at Brooklyn's
Ebbet's Field, the Dodgers will advertise on their outfield walls.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; On the other hand, it won't be all bad: Dodgers players will be
able to select a commemorative patch of a past Dodger hero to wear
on his uniform.  &UR; Eric Karros will wear one of  &UR; Gil Hodges and  &UR; Eric
Young is one of a few who have picked  &UR; Jackie Robinson. Wonder if
anyone will take  &UR; Steve Sax?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Flashback: Freddie Patek.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; What's the message, go find a lake? The 1999 Florida Marlins
pocket schedule has a white background with nothing but a fishing
cap filled with pins on it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; My bad: Thanks to all who called to let me know  &UR; Tom
 &UR; Seaver is not 58. Nonetheless, he will turn 55 this year and that
still sounds too old for Mr. Met. &QL; 
EXTRA BASES &QL; 
Seattle, the overwhelming choice to win the AL West last year,
returns only 12 players to spring camp who were on the opening day
roster a year ago. And if  &UR; Bobby Ayala is traded or released, as
expected, the number will be reduced to 11.
</P>
<P>
   They can talk all they want about being a younger, quicker club
in 1999. The reality of the Baltimore Orioles is they will remain
one of the oldest clubs in ball. Catcher  &UR; Charles Johnson (27) will
be the only regular under 30 on the opening day roster. Of the 25
projected players on the roster, 21 will be at least 30.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dennis Martinez retired last week, telling a reporter in his
native Nicaragua the news. The Atlanta Braves, who gave Martinez
his lone chance to become the winningest Latin-born pitcher, were
not happy, at least privately. The Braves wanted to invite Martinez
to become a coach. At the very least, they wanted to hold the
retirement press conference.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sparky Anderson was voted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame
last week. Anderson guided the Big Red Machine to four World Series
appearances and two titles during a seven-year span in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis slugger  &UR; Mark McGwire will appear on the Feb. 22
episode of ``Mad About You.'' McGwire, who will play himself, is
the object of  &UR; Helen Hunt's character's affections in the show.
McGwire will appear bare-chested in the show.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bill Mazeroski, arguably the greatest defensive second baseman
ever, will rejoin Pittsburgh as a spring training coach. Pirates
infielders, who made 95 errors last season, could use the help.
Mazeroski, who won eight Gold Gloves, is expected to be named to
the Hall of Fame by the veteran's committee on March 2. &QL; 
THE RUMOR MILL &QL; 
Should  &UR; Wil Cordero win the everyday designated hitter's job during
spring training, Cleveland might be willing to listen to offers for
highly-rated prospects  &UR; Richie Sexson,  &UR; Alex Ramirez or  &UR; Jacob
Cruz. The price would be a starting pitcher. Listen up,
Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   It's certainly a long-shot, but don't discount the possibility
of Seattle having 19-year-old flame-thrower  &UR; Ryan Anderson in its
opening day rotation. When asked of the possibility, Manager
 &UR; Lou Piniella said, ``Let's see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia appears to be cooling on the idea of signing  &UR; Orel
Hershiser to a 1999 contract. The biggest reason is trying to
justify giving Hershiser $2 million and not opening up that
rotation spot for one of the Phillies young pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   With Minnesota facing an $18 million payroll heading into spring
training, the club is facing the task of dealing away closer  &UR; Rick
Aguilera and outfielder  &UR; Marty Cordova to reach the desired $11
million level.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego closer  &UR; Trevor Hoffmann, who was close to signing a
three-year $15 million deal several months ago, has changed his
mind after watching events in the past few weeks. Hoffman now wants
a four-year deal for $32 million and he wants a no-trade clause.
</P>
<P>
   If the Brewers get off to a bad start, Milwaukee's
 &UR; Phil Garner is the first to recognize he may be the first manager
fired this year. He will not, however, tolerate that as an excuse
for poor play from his players. ``I'm not worried about losing my
job, so they shouldn't be, either.'' &QL;

LEONARD REPRE SENTS WHAT DE LA HOYA WANTS TO BE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Officially,  &UR; Sugar Ray Leonard was part of the
promotional team for  &UR; Oscar De La Hoya's welterweight clash
Saturday night with  &UR; Ike Quartey.
</P>
<P>
   Symbolically, Leonard was much more.
</P>
<P>
   He represents what De La Hoya hopes to become.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard faced a string of tough opponents _  &UR; Roberto Duran,
Thomas
 &UR; Hearns, Marvin Hagler and  &UR; Wilfredo Benitez. He defeated most of
them. More important, he was confronted with adversity in a loss to
Duran and eventually prevailed with a victory in the rematch.
</P>
<P>
   Until the confrontation with Quartey, De La Hoya had yet to
withstand Leonard's trial by fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very blessed to have had a Benitez, Duran and Hearns,''
said Leonard, who was joined by Hearns in promotional work. ``The
only way to be considered great is to fight great fighters.''
</P>
<P>
   A postscript: Hearns and Leonard fought to a controversial draw
in a rematch of Leonard's classic victory in the first bout.
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, Leonard concedes what has always been argued:
</P>
<P>
   Hearns won the second fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``From Ray Leonard, I accept that,'' Hearns said. &QL; 
Hostile takeover
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya's move from marquee fighter to boxer-promoter figures
to be official sometime after Saturday night's bout.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Marc Ratner, executive director of the Nevada Athletic
Commission said the state's attorneys first have to review an
agreement for De La Hoya to join  &UR; Bob Arum in co-promotion of
future bouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure exactly how Oscar can be a partner in a
promotion,'' Ratner said.
</P>
<P>
   Arum said the agreement is for only one fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it works, and works well, we'll extend it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The joint venture has been fueling speculation that De La Hoya
eventually will leave Arum.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Spanish-speaking media, a misunderstanding
over an Arum option for a rematch with Quartey angered De La Hoya.
It was later explained that Arum retains that option for most
fights in the event of an upset.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, De La Hoya kept the rumor mill working overtime by
saying: ``I told them jokingly I am going to get rid of Bob Arum
and re-sign him as a partner.'' &QL; 
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   On the undercard: World Boxing Council super-bantamweight champ
 &UR; Erik
 &UR; Morales (32-0, 26 KOs) of Tijuana threw a beautiful right hand for
a second-round knockout of Puerto Rican challenger  &UR; Angel Chacon
(24-3, 14 KOs).
</P>
<P>
   Featherweight  &UR; Mia St. John, a former Playboy model, fought
motivation and  &UR; Amanda Skelton on Saturday night's undercard. Her
fold-out looks are her opponents' biggest target. ``They're
jealous,'' said St. John, who won a decision. ``They think I've
gotten where I am because I was a model.''
</P>
<P>
   Quartey trained at the Pensacola, Fla., gym that is home for
light-heavyweight champion  &UR; Roy Jones, Jr., who is De La Hoya's
rival in the ongoing pound-for-pound debate. ``People in Ghana know
who De La Hoya is,'' Quartey said before the opening bell. ``I'm
not that well-known in the U.S., but people will know my name
whether I knocked him out or not.'' &QL;

NAU COASTS PAST MONTANA  
 LUMBERJACKS STILL IN BIG SKY HUNT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RORY FAUST  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. _ It was senior night in the J. Lawrence Walkup
Skydome Saturday night, but the NAU seniors are hoping Saturday
night's 74-53 thrashing of Montana won't be their last home game of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   If the Lumberjacks (18-5, 10-2 Big Sky) fare well on their
season-ending four-game road trip, they could host the Big Sky
tournament for the third year in a row.
</P>
<P>
   NAU coach Ben Howland said the win was also important because
the Grizzlies had been playing well.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been playing tough lately,'' Howland said. ``They beat
Weber State (which is second in the Big Sky) handily last week.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael McNair led the Lumberjacks with 15 points and Casey
Frank added 12 points and six rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Montana cut NAU's 12-point halftime lead to 11 on a Cory Reiser
three-pointer five minutes into the second, but the Lumberjacks
widened the margin to 16 one minute later on Kawika Akina's three.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 47-34 with just over 12 minutes left, Montana
implemented a full-court trapping press in hopes of getting back
into the game, but Frank shattered those hopes with a dunk, which
widened the Lumberjacks advantage to 15 with 15:55 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way you want to break a trap,'' Frank said. ``That
made them get out of (the press) real quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank's dunk sparked a 9-2 run, which put the Grizzlies away.
Ross Land's three pointer put NAU up 52-34 with 10:30 left, and
Akina's eight-foot leaner capped the run and increased the lead to
20 with seven minutes remaining in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Lumberjacks opened up their largest lead of the game, 71-44,
on Matt Gebhardt's fast break layup with 1:48 left.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams looked sloppy in the first half, but NAU managed to
pull away because of Montana's cold shooting. The Grizzlies shot 29
percent from the field in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Land's three-pointer with 8:27 left in the half gave the
Lumberjacks an 18-8 lead, and six minutes later Land's alley-oop to
Frank put NAU up by 15, 30-15.
</P>
<P>
   The teams traded free throws in the final two minutes of the
half, and NAU took a 32-18 into the break.
</P>
<P>

points,finished with 16 points and five rebounds. &QL;

TURNOVERS DOOM DEVILS IN OVERTIME LOSS TO CATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - Arizona State's guards held their own against
Arizona for 40 minutes Saturday night, giving the Sun Devils a
chance to snap their 11-game losing streak in the women's
basketball rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   Then came overtime, the second consecutive OT game for ASU at
Wells Fargo Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The guards who committed just six turnovers in the first half
gave up six in the five-minute extra frame, UA scored the first
nine points in winning 76-67, and the streak now is a full six
years long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guards were hesitant (in overtime) and boom the game is
over,'' said ASU Coach Charli Turner Thorne, working four days
after giving birth to her first child. ``It was definitely an
experience issue. The bottom line is the team that was more
aggressive was going to win, and we got cautious.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats (13-8, 8-4 Pac-10) opened OT with a three-pointer
by junior guard Lisa Griffith. Then sophomore guard Reshea Bristol,
replaced last week in the starting lineup by freshman Julie Brase,
took over.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Pickney stole Natalie Tucker's inlet pass for Rachel
Holt, resulting in a layup by Bristol, who sprained her right ankle
late in the first half. Bristol followed with a steal at half-court
and scored on another layup. Angela Lackey then batted a Tucker
pass to Griffith, who fed Bristol again for a 68-59 lead with half
of overtime gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like coming out after halftime,'' Bristol said of the
overtime burst. ``To have a 9-0 lead is unbelievable. We had to be
the aggressor.''
</P>
<P>
   Bristol finished with 20 points, the combined total for Griffith
and Felecity Willis. Lackey added 16.
</P>
<P>
   The win is critical to UA's drive for a third consecutive NCAA
Tournament berth. Even with a split of their three remaining
series, the Wildcats might be able to qualify although Coach Joan
Bonvicini thinks a minimum 4-2 finish is necessary. The stretch run
includes games against the Pac-10's top three: No. 12 UCLA, Oregon
and Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``We control out own destiny,'' Bonvicini said. ``Our strength
of schedule helps us. The tournament (committee) looks at the last
10 games, and we've won eight.''
</P>
<P>
   ASU (10-11, 4-8) must win four of its final six to register its
first winning season since 1992-93. That would require an upset of
one of the league's Big Three, but might be possible if freshman
forward Theresa Jantzen continues at her conference Player of the
Week level.
</P>
<P>
   Jantzen had season highs of 24 points and 16 rebounds, her third
double-double, and scored 13 consecutive ASU points in the second
half to help the Devils overcome a 12-0 run that put the Wildcats
up 54-43 and threatening to run away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still real young,'' Jantzen said. ``We know we can beat
them so easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not so easily, but realistically some day soon. &QL;

<P>
   TUCSON _ It seemed like a good idea at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Coach Lute Olson takes advantage of the weeks of games
against Arizona State to schedule nationally televised games
against top-25 opponents, since the Wildcats have just the one
Pac-10 game those weeks. It doesn't hurt recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   When Olson and Dale Brown, then coach at Louisiana State, agreed
to play a home-and-home series, LSU was an annual fixture on the
national scene and was about to get _ it thought _ center Lester
Earl.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Brown has been forced out. The program has faced the
threat of NCAA sanctions over, among other things, the manner in
which Earl was recruited. He transferred to Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   So when the Tigers, under new coach John Brady, limped into
McKale Center on Saturday a game below .500 and on a five-game
skid, it seemed the game had lost its luster.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, LSU played like the team Olson expected to see when the
contract was signed, extending the 10th-ranked Wildcats to the
closing minute before they saved their 28th straight home win,
78-71. With it, the 10th-ranked Wildcats moved closer to their 12th
straight 20-win season and 15th straight NCAA Tournament bid.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Arizona's players seemed far more concerned with what
had happened to those teams that were playing Pac-10 games on
Saturday _ and for the Wildcats the news was good.
</P>
<P>
   The team just ahead of it, Stanford, and the one just behind it,
UCLA, lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``We watched the Stanford game at home before we came over,''
said UA center A.J. Bramlett. ``That was big for us. We're now back
in control of our destiny in the Pac-10 and that's pretty
exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   UA point guard Jason Terry, who tied a school record with seven
three-point baskets that carried him to 25 points, described the
turn of events as ``extra motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry acknowledged that it didn't last long.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we're right back in it,'' Terry said. ``We want to win
the Pac-10 title. Anything is still possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this game shows us that we still play to the level of the
team we're playing, and we can't do that. We came out lazy at both
ends. It was a lax effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Terry's three-pointers, which quieted each LSU rally
attempt, was one from two steps across midcourt that banked in and
gave UA a nine-point halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   The featured match-up between UA freshman power forward Michael
Wright and LSU's Stromile Swift was everything expected of two
players who were judged to be among the 15 best high school seniors
in the country last season.
</P>
<P>
   Swift, who scored 21 points _ the third straight game he has
established a career high _ and grabbed nine rebounds, cut
Arizona's lead to five when he tossed a jump hook over Wright with
2:47 to play.
</P>
<P>
   But Wright (15 points, 11 rebounds) retaliated by rebounding a
miss by Bramlett and scoring with 37 seconds left to give Arizona a
seven-point edge, all it needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the better players I've played against so far,''
Wright said. ``I played against him in high school and he's only
gotten better.''
</P>
<P>
   Olson had recruited Swift before learning that he had academic
difficulties. Olson then turned to Wright, who has become the
leading freshman scorer and rebounder in the Pac-10, and a possible
Freshman All-American.
</P>
<P>
   ``LSU had talked about canceling when the program went into a
bit of a decline and with the threat of sanctions,'' Olson said.
``Now Coach Brady has built it back up with a great freshman class
and they'll be in good shape when they get more experience.''

 &HT;    Husband copes with loss of loved one, long romance
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At age 56, Jim Webster talks about his wife Marianne
with the passion of a 25-year-old. His eyes glisten when he recalls
the last time they biked together _ on a Florida beach, last
Easter.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a oneness we felt that morning,'' he said, ``and we
talked about it. Our marriage was about sharing _ and not because
of any contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Five days later, on April 17, Marianne was biking in her
Dunwoody neighborhood when her totebag got tangled in the spokes of
her bicycle wheel. She took a fatal fall.
</P>
<P>
   For 30 years, they had done everything together _ sports,
cooking, kids, travel. But it was the routine everyday things that
lost meaning without her. No one to make the coffee for each
morning _ no one to share the newspaper. No one to tell him he's
loved. And the plants _ why isn't she there to water the darn
things?
</P>
<P>
   Webster still hasn't emptied the bedroom drawers, hasn't touched
the cosmetics on the dresser.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see them and it's a sameness I'm not ready to leave. I don't
want anything to feel empty.''
</P>
<P>
   Marianne was in a coma after her accident. Webster made the hard
decision to remove the artificial life support. He and the two
grown children stayed by Marianne's bedside after they moved her to
the hospice. She died three days later. Daughter Emily discovered
early-blooming purple flowers outside the French doors to
Marianne's room moments after her death and brought some in. None
of them will ever forget that.
</P>
<P>
   Webster can smile now, laugh even, as he remembers his long
romance _ the times they flew kites with the kids, the fierce
tennis matches with each other (Marianne was a 1998 Atlanta doubles
champion), the music they liked, the making up after little spats.
</P>
<P>
   They both enjoyed classical works, Bach especially, but they had
favorite pop singers too. Once Webster and Marianne were listening
to Celine Dion's ``No living, No Loving Without You.''
</P>
<P>
   Marianne placed her hand on him gently. ``If you ever leave
me,'' she said. ``This is the way I'm going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Remembering makes him cry.
</P>
<P>
   Webster loved seeing Marianne find her own identity after years
of devoting herself to family. Men and women are on different life
cycles, he says. A CPA with his own firm, he'd arrived at a time
when he didn't want ``those 500 clients'' anymore. He wanted to
wind down. But Marianne was just getting started, and he admired
her new-found confidence. In addition to her run for the
Legislature, she was president-elect of a national women's
organization, Women in Action for New Directions (WAND).
</P>
<P>
   Webster finds comfort in his work on ``Marianne's Fund,''
started by WAND and the Webster family to raise money for the
issues Marianne cared about, the reduction of nuclear weapons,
environmental preservation and women in leadership. The fund has
$150,000 and an equal amount pledged. WAND has chapters all over
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Webster runs and works and savors time with close
friends. And spring will bring good things _ visits with Emily, a
University of Georgia graduate who works in Washington, and son
Jacob, who graduates from medical school in May. He'll be a
grandfather soon, too. Jacob and wife Susy don't know if it's a boy
or a girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either way,'' Jim says, `` I'm going to see a lot of Marianne
in it.''

 &HT;    For the good it does for some, it saps others' education
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ What's wrong with TAAS? Nothing may be more
emblematic than the reprimand a student received recently _ for
reading a history book.
</P>
<P>
   He and classmates were penned up for a TAAS chalk talk.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills. As academic
futures are pinned to it in Waco, all eyes will be trained on the
chalk, even the eyes of students like the reprimanded one who will
ace the test in half the time some peers need. Then this student
and others will fidget in silence, not even a restroom break, as
precious seconds tick away from their education.
</P>
<P>
   In Waco schools, this happens not just in tests but in practice
tests. That means some students who master TAAS get extra practice
in not fidgeting, and not learning.
</P>
<P>
   As my son says about every TAAS-related thing, ``We now
interrupt our regularly scheduled learning for...'' Ask teachers.
Ask students. They will say TAAS is 9.9 parts interruption, .01
part learning.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, many students need to spend extra time on the basic skills
and to feel comfortable with TAAS.
</P>
<P>
   But even with improvements aimed at ``higher-order'' skills over
the years, TAAS is far too basic to be considered a sufficient
challenge for large numbers of students.
</P>
<P>
   Texas should stop the interruptions, or commit itself to
minimizing them.
</P>
<P>
   Texas children should be able to test out of TAAS drudgery.
</P>
<P>
   They should be able to say, ``I'm ready to ace it'' on Day 1 of
school, or Day 2, to take it, dispense with it and never over the
next nine months have to endure any more interruptions and TAAS
chalk talks.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers are considering broadening the state student
assessment, including an 11th-grade exit test and testing more
students on social studies and science. A big problem, however, is
what's attached: A price tag of $100 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has a reasonable means of reducing those costs. Let
students ``test out'' of TAAS or whatever Texas calls its
successor. Let them, at a time of their choosing, log on to a
computer and pull the trigger. Let them do it the week before
school starts, after school, before school.
</P>
<P>
   Schools have had it exactly backward in the students they've
shackled with TAAS and those they've exempted. Until a state
crackdown, schools were exempting hundreds of thousands of
academically challenged students, the very children who most needed
the emphasis on the basics. Meanwhile, students who had the basics
down were subjected to mind-numbing TAAS review and all those
lovely interruptions to learning.
</P>
<P>
   I'm imagining the benefit of children knowing that they can
prepare to pass TAAS before school starts, meaning they'd not have
to worry about it during school. I'm imagining students so juiced
by that prospect they'd actually review a TAAS workbook in August
and then line up to be tested at the first opportunity so as to
spare themselves TAAS prep in September, October, November,
December, January, February, March, April and May.
</P>
<P>
   Making every child spend a whole year prepping for TAAS is using
a tomato mallet to hammer every brain into the same jar.
</P>
<P>
   The legislature did something good in 1997 when it made it
possible for students who passed end-of-course tests in Algebra I,
English II and either biology or U.S. History to forgo TAAS. But
reforms now in the hopper in Austin would revoke that option.
Everybody back to TAAS. Is this necessary? The answer is no, but it
fits in with one-size-fits-all education fixes.
</P>
<P>
   Unquestionably, no one should be graduating from high school or
even advancing to the next grade without grade-level skills. But
Texas' fixation with ``the basics'' has fitted wings of concrete
onto many children capable of flight.
</P>
<P>
   When it's an academic offense for a boy to to read his history
book, Texas, you've done him wrong.
</P>
<P>
   John Young is the opinion page editor of the Waco
Tribune-Herald. His column appears Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday.

 &HT;    Rex, Zulu to kick off Mardi Gras together
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Zulu, the historically black parading krewe, for
years has been the warm-up act and sometime nemesis of Rex, the
mostly-white group that is the centerpiece of Mardi Gras. On Fat
Tuesday, Zulu rolls its floats down St. Charles Avenue first _ and
often late _ followed by Rex, the king of Carnival.
</P>
<P>
   And the day before, on Lundi Gras, it is the king of Rex who
travels across the Mississippi River, meets the mayor in the French
Quarter and asks him to proclaim Mardi Gras an official holiday.
Then they toast the event with champagne. The king of Zulu also
crosses the river and meets the mayor, but it is a separate event,
and does not officially mark the beginning of the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, for the first time, Rex and Zulu will toast the
mayor together.
</P>
<P>
   It may sound like a small gesture, but for Zulu, who spent
almost 60 years marching on back streets because blacks weren't
allowed on the main parade routes, it is an important display of
mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it was important that they toast each other and
meet the mayor together, to indicate to the community that we are
bridging the gap,'' said City Councilman Roy Glapion, who has been
a member of the Zulu krewe for 27 years. ``Certainly during the
days of segregation this would have been unheard of.''
</P>
<P>
   Rex, the only 19th-century krewe that still parades and the most
traditional of the 60 or so parading organizations, says this is
not so much about race as it is about marking two anniversaries.
This year is the 300th anniversary of Mardi Gras in Louisiana, and
the 50th anniversary of jazz legend Louis Armstrong serving as the
king of Zulu.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anniversaries are very important in Mardi Gras,'' said King
Logan, a Rex official. ``A lot of people are very happy with what
Rex and Zulu are doing this year, but there are no commitments to
do this again.''
</P>
<P>
   Rex guards its traditions very carefully, Logan said, so change
doesn't come easily. That could be said of many of the traditional
krewes. In fact, some traditionalists proclaimed the death of Mardi
Gras when, in 1992, the city council passed an ordinance that
forced the krewes to integrate or stop marching. Several krewes
quit parading in protest; Rex continued to parade, allowing two
black members in 1992 and a handful more in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue still stings.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is buried history, and we don't need to talk about
anything relating to 1992,'' Logan said.
</P>
<P>
   Glapion, on the other hand, said he thinks the ordinance eased
tensions between blacks and whites, and made the Lundi Gras toast
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``That caused some problems at the time, but I think we are
closer now as a result,'' Glapion said.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Hardy, a member of Rex and publisher of the Mardi Gras
Guide, said the meeting has little significance and has been
overplayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not front-page news,'' he said. ``Since 1992, there has
been nothing but cooperation. It's symbolic and a sweet moment, but
it's not a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Rex and Zulu couldn't be more different in style and history.
</P>
<P>
   Rex created the concept of day parades in 1872. That same year,
Rex decided on the official song for Mardi Gras, ``If I Ever Cease
to Love,'' and the official colors _ purple, green and gold. The
king, whose identity remains secret until Lundi Gras, is always a
civic leader, and his queen is a debutante. The king and his court
wear regal outfits that make them look like playing cards.
</P>
<P>
   Zulu was founded in 1909 by a group of black laborers in a
benevolent society called the Tramps. They changed their name to
the Zulu Social Aid and Pleasure Club after seeing a vaudeville
play called ``There Never Was and Never Will Be a King Like Me,''
about the African tribe, Zulu.
</P>
<P>
   That year, Zulu paraded through black neighborhoods and from bar
to bar on Mardi Gras, spoofing Rex by having a king of their own,
resplendent in a lard can crown and carrying a banana stalk
sceptor. In future years, members would take to wearing grass
skirts and blackface makeup. They throw spears along with beads,
and painted coconuts, one of the most prized throws of the Mardi
Gras season.
</P>
<P>
   The African motif drew sharp criticism during the civil rights
movement from blacks who said the get-ups were demeaning. The krewe
almost dissolved, but was revived in the late 1960s. The costumes,
the spears and the coconuts endure to this day.
</P>
<P>
   The Zulu parade, which hit the main parade route in 1968, is
wildly popular and always late. Rex can't start rolling until Zulu
does, because they both go down St. Charles Avenue. Last year, Zulu
enraged Rex by getting a late start and then suffering a two-hour
delay in the Garden District when a float broke down. The king of
Rex got so agitated he abandoned his float to go to a friend's
house along the parade route until things got moving again.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, Rex and Zulu will come together in the name of
.... tradition? Racial harmony? Both sides say not to read too much
into all this.
</P>
<P>
   For those who think grass skirts and spears are demeaning,
Glapion says, ``It's just for fun.''
</P>
<P>
   And for those wishing to read deep meaning into today's toast,
Logan says, ``This is Mardi Gras. Let's not take this too
seriously.

 &HT;    Dortch leads the way for young African-American males
 &HT;    By Peter Scott
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tommy Dortch's flair for leadership goes back years
ago when he was in college.
</P>
<P>
   As student government president at Fort Valley State College, he
came close to winning a seat to the Democratic National Convention
in 1972, losing by just 16 votes to then-Gov. Jimmy Carter. Two
years later, Dortch was named associate director of the Democratic
Party of Georgia. He has been climbing the leadership ladder ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   While Dortch, 48, was unable to unseat Carter, the daring he and
other students showed in challenging the state's political
establishment earned them community support. It also led to
hundreds of blacks in Fort Valley registering to vote and
subsequently electing that city's first black mayor, Rudolph
Carson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tommy carried himself as a leader. He was always involved,''
said Tom Palmer, former dean of students at Fort Valley. ``He was
never afraid to make a decision. If he felt something had to be
done, he made that decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Dortch, who owns an Atlanta-based public relations firm,
finds himself leading another generation of young men.
</P>
<P>
   As president of the 100 Black Men of America, Dortch heads a
service organization that is developing leadership skills among
scores of young African-American males. The organization announced
last month plans for a new Youth Leadership Center it plans to
build about 45 miles southwest of Atlanta by the year 2000. Land
for the $7 million center stretches over 500 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Dortch's ``pull-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps'' attitude was
instilled in him as a boy growing up in Toccoa, a closely-knit city
at the foot of the North Georgia mountains.
</P>
<P>
   While away at Fort Valley, Dortch became a contender for a
delegate seat at the National Democratic Convention at the urging
of former legislators Ben Brown and Julian Brown. If one more
busload of voting students had shown up, Dortch might have won the
seat instead of Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know I was running against Carter, but my parents
always instilled in me if you believe you could do something, you
could do it, and if you wanted something, go all out to get it,''
said Dortch.
</P>
<P>
   He did not lose politically. Former U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn picked
him to join his staff and, in 1990, Dortch became the first
African-American to serve as a state director for one of the
nation's senators.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Dortch's mother, Lizzie, served as a mentor to welfare
mothers, there were others who helped her son: educators such as
Betty Henderson, L.F. Thoma, Willie Mae Keels and Anna Canady;
barbers M.C. Scott and Robert Holley; electrician Clarence Wilson;
and funeral home director and former Mayor James Neal.
</P>

   Dortch keeps a busy schedule. TWD has as many as seven meetings
a day, often tied to the seven Fortune 500 companies Dortch counts
among his clients. Still, he finds time to practice what he
preaches. Atlantan Gabriel Miller, a 21-year-old intern who wants
to become an architect, is one of dozens of young people for whom
he is a mentor. Dortch and other mentors include interns in their
corporate meetings, conferences and social gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard much criticism that black males don't do this and
that. This (the institute) is an effort to take care of our own,
and that will benefit everybody,'' Dortch said.
</P>
<P>
   Dortch and his wife, Carol, head of the regional office of the
General Services Administration, have four children and are
preparing the two youngest to operate their own businesses.
</P>
<P>
   One son, Thomas III, is getting an early start. At 12, Thomas is
vice chairman of the board of directors for Dortch's TWD Inc. A
20-year-old daughter, Angel, is a secretary for the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people talk today about the village concept of raising a
child, that worked for me in Toccoa. Whether it was right down the
street or cross town, we had a full city of people who cared about
kids and looked out for kids. That's the kind of thing we need now
in order to succeed,'' said Dortch.
</P>
<P>
   Dortch grew up idolizing the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and
Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall as heroes. Now he can put
youngsters in touch with successful black men like Gen. Colin
Powell, former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young and and American Express
President and CEO Kenneth I. Chenault. The 13-year-old service
organization has provided mentoring to more than 60,000 youngsters
at its 84 chapters internationally.

   ISRAEL-ORTHODOX _ JERUSALEM _ In an ominous display of one of
Israel's greatest societal rifts, about 100,000 ultra-Orthodox Jews
are expected to protest against the Israeli Supreme Court, which
they have called ``anti-Jewish.'' The court has made several
rulings that go against the special status that Ultra-Orthodox Jews
have had. Counter demonstrations and violence expected. (Kaplow,

   GUATEMALA _ At age 9, Magdalena Jochola watched the military
cart away her father, the first in a line of male relatives
kidnapped, never to be heard from again. For almost 40 years,
generations of Guatemalans watched friends and family members
disappear during an often-brutal civil war. In 1996, peace accords
were signed, leading the way for Magda and about 80 other students
to work toward preventing the brutality from happening again. With
a grant from the U.S. Agency for International Development, UT, two
Guatemalan universities and the fledgling Guatemalan government are
setting up the sometimes mundane apparatus that keeps democratic
governments functioning: budget boards, house research
organizations, etc. They are making recommendations to the
Guatemalan Deputies on which laws to expunge, which laws to rewrite
and how to rewrite them. The students _ most of whom are between
20- and 25-years-old _ are invaluable assistants to Guatemala's
modern-day founding fathers. They are, says the American chief of
party there, ``midwives in the birth of a nation.'' (Brooks, Austin

   VOUCHERS _ The push is on, once again, for a voucher plan in
Texas. But the politics are trickier, and perhaps more treacherous,
than ever before. Pete Laney, Speaker of the House, has become more
vocal about his criticism, and some say he stacked the House Public
Education Committee to reflect his stronger and more public stance
against vouchers. Coalitions are shifting. Once there was a bright
line, with conservative and mostly white Republicans on one side
and Democrats, liberal and otherwise on the other side. Now more
minorities and Democrats support vouchers. Meanwhile a growing
conservative contingent, the Eagle Forum and the Baptists, are
opposed to them. Tactics also have changed. Lobbyists and groups
are putting a human face on the issue, with both sides sending
parents to the Legislature to do their bidding. There is still a
lot of money being funneled into the push for vouchers. But the
shifting politics and coalitions spell trouble for vouchers, many
say. (Brooks, Austin American-Statesman)

   BLACK-MEN-AMERICA _ As president of the 100 Black Men of
America, 48-year-old Tommy Dortch heads a service organization that
is developing leadership skills among scores of young
African-American males. The organization announced last month that
it is poised to groom scores more from Atlanta and around the
country through a new Youth Leadership Center it plans to build
about 45 miles southwest of Atlanta by the year 2000. Land for the
$7 million center stretches over 500 acres encompassing Coweta,
Meriwether, and Troup counties. ``We've heard much criticism that
black males don't do this and that. This (the institute) is an

Dortch said. (Scott, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED

   GOP-LINCOLN _ WASHINGTON _ In the general election last fall,
the best any statewide Republican candidate could do among African
American voters was George Voinovich's 30 percent in Ohio's U.S.
Senate race. That was nearly three times the national average. And
the most prominent African American in the GOP, Oklahoma
Congressman J.C. Watt, believes it make take at least another
decade to get the Party of Lincoln up to just 20 percent. That is
likely to spell political problems for the party in the 2000
presidential and congressional races. (Shepard, Cox News Service)

   GLOBAL-ECON-I (Undated) _ It is still not clear that the
financial upheavals, which began in Thailand in July 1997, will
ever damage the United States. But the collapse of Brazil's
currency in January and the jolt that it brought to markets
worldwide underscored the continuing risks of ``the most serious
financial crisis in a half a century,'' as Clinton called it in his
State of the Union address. This series of four articles is a
narrative of the worldwide financial crisis that over the last 20
months has toppled some governments and hobbled others. The crisis
illustrates how globalization increasingly stitches lives all over
the world into a single economic quilt. In the new economic
landscape that has emerged in recent years, the pool of
international investments has grown to dwarf the sums that
governments can muster, and money zips around the globe far faster
than ever before. The result is a world more prosperous; but also,
perhaps, a bit more wobbly. By Nicholas D. Kristof with Edward
Wyatt. 6,500 words, pix, graphics.

 &HT;    GOP, IN STRATEGY SHIFT, PREPARES TO COURT MINORITIES
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Richard Nixon's ``Southern Strategy'' of the 1960s,
which provided the final push in transforming ``the party of
Lincoln'' into the political party overwhelmingly favored by the
great-grandsons of the old Confederacy, may have finally run its
historical course.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's strategy, which played on racial jealousies, was a
numerical success. It helped the GOP win five of the past eight
presidential elections. It brought the two-party system back to the
once solidly Democratic South. And, finally, in 1994, it helped the
GOP end 40 years of Democratic rule of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   This President's Day, however, Nixon's strategy seems
politically threadbare and, with the growth of ethnic minorities
producing a profound change in the country's demographics,
potentially devastating to a party once on the verge of becoming
the majority party in American politics.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party got a glimpse of the political future last
fall when a larger-than-expected turnout of minority voters helped
the Democratic Party buck historic trends to gain five
congressional seats and, perhaps more ominously for the GOP, to
unseat two Republican incumbent governors in the deep South.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be clear to GOP leaders after (the 1998) election
that the Southern strategy has run its course,'' said Faye
Anderson, a national vice chairman of the New Majority Council, a
new Republican National Committee (RNC) project aimed at reaching
out to minority voters.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, the only black Republican
in Congress, acknowledged last week that it would take at least
another decade for his party to win just 30 percent of the African
American vote in national elections.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three presidential elections, nearly nine out of 10
African Americans have voted Democratic. In last fall's off-year
election, the GOP averaged only 11 percent of the black vote
nationally, a key factor in the loss of U.S. Senate seats in North
Carolina and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Only one white GOP candidate anywhere in the country in 1998 got
the 30 percent the GOP is shooting for in the next decade _ George
Voinovich of Ohio, who was elected to succeed John Glenn in the
U.S. Senate.

<P>
   But few Republicans in Congress have the kind of moderate record
Voinovich built during eight years as Ohio's governor. And none of
the Southerners who dominate the GOP leadership of Congress have
such a record.
</P>
<P>
   Watts, in an interview with USA Today last week, insisted that
the GOP's problem is largely one of communication, that when
Republicans use the word ``conservative'' it conjures up images of
George Wallace, the onetime segregationist governor of Alabama, and
Bull Connor, the police chief who used fire hoses on black
protesters in Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   But ``positive polarization,'' the benign-sounding term Nixon
used for his strategy, has given the Republican Party an equally
``hateful and frightening face'' today, said Richard Tafel,
executive director of Log Cabin Republicans, a national homosexual
political group that uses Abraham Lincoln, the GOP's first
successful presidential candidate, as a symbol of its cause.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Southern Strategy'' is responsible for ``ushering in
spates of gay bashing, intolerance toward legal immigrants and
declarations of 'a Christian nation,' essentially telling Jews and
those outside of fundamentalist Christianity to get lost,'' Tafel
said.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Julian Bond, chairman of the National Association of
the Advancement of Colored People, said, ``The party is viewed as
driven by a fanatic and intolerant minority whose rigidity is at
odds with most Americans, including blacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond said the actions of the GOP and its leaders today send
political messages to minorities that can hardly be characterized
as misunderstandings:
</P>
<P>
   _ Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich's lawsuit challenging
procedures designed to ensure an accurate count of minorities in
the next census.
</P>
<P>
   _ Current Speaker Dennis Hastert's co-sponsorship of a
resolution to eliminate all equal opportunity programs at the
federal level.
</P>
<P>
   _ The GOP's opposition to federal affirmative action programs
and support for state initiatives to end such programs at the state
level.
</P>
<P>
   _ The appearance of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of
Mississippi and Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia before the Council of
Conservative Citizens, an offspring of the old White Citizens'
Councils that took up arms against federal troops enforcing
desegregation orders in Mississippi and Arkansas in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   RNC Chairman Jim Nicholson insisted there is ``a cause for
optimism'' about GOP relations with minorities. He said their
``shared legacy,'' dating back to the party's founding on an
anti-slavery platform in 1854, is ``a foundation on which to
build'' better relations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the party's next presidential nominee could help it
overcome the legacy of Nixon's ``Southern Strategy'' with a more
moderate message such as ``compassionate conservatism,'' a favorite
term of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But as long as candidates such as former Ku Klux Klan leader
David Duke, now campaigning for Congress in Louisiana, feel at home
in the GOP, the ``party of Lincoln'' is going to be viewed with
suspicion by minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``African Americans long have known that, as the late (Carter
Health, Education and Welfare) Secretary Patricia Roberts Harris
used to say, 'Just because we're paranoid does not mean that
they're not out to get us','' said Yvonne Scruggs-Leftwich,
executive director of the Black Leadership Forum Inc., an umbrella
organization for dozens of civil rights groups.

 &HT;    GOP, IN STRATEGY SHIFT, PREPARES TO COURT MINORITIES
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Richard Nixon's ``Southern Strategy'' of the 1960s,
which provided the final push in transforming ``the party of
Lincoln'' into the political party overwhelmingly favored by the
great-grandsons of the old Confederacy, may have finally run its
historical course.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's strategy, which played on racial jealousies, was a
numerical success. It helped the GOP win five of the past eight
presidential elections. It brought the two-party system back to the
once solidly Democratic South. And, finally, in 1994, it helped the
GOP end 40 years of Democratic rule of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   This President's Day, however, Nixon's strategy seems
politically threadbare and, with the growth of ethnic minorities
producing a profound change in the country's demographics,
potentially devastating to a party once on the verge of becoming
the majority party in American politics.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party got a glimpse of the political future last
fall when a larger-than-expected turnout of minority voters helped
the Democratic Party buck historic trends to gain five
congressional seats and, perhaps more ominously for the GOP, to
unseat two Republican incumbent governors in the deep South.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be clear to GOP leaders after (the 1998) election
that the Southern strategy has run its course,'' said Faye
Anderson, a national vice chairman of the New Majority Council, a
new Republican National Committee (RNC) project aimed at reaching
out to minority voters.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, the only black Republican
in Congress, acknowledged last week that it would take at least
another decade for his party to win just 30 percent of the African
American vote in national elections.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three presidential elections, nearly nine out of 10
African Americans have voted Democratic. In last fall's off-year
election, the GOP averaged only 11 percent of the black vote
nationally, a key factor in the loss of U.S. Senate seats in North
Carolina and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Only one white GOP candidate anywhere in the country in 1998 got
the 30 percent the GOP is shooting for in the next decade _ George
Voinovich of Ohio, who was elected to succeed John Glenn in the
U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But few Republicans in Congress have the kind of moderate record
Voinovich built during eight years as Ohio's governor. And none of
the Southerners who dominate the GOP leadership of Congress have
such a record.
</P>
<P>
   Watts, in an interview with USA Today last week, insisted that
the GOP's problem is largely one of communication, that when

PACE OF AMERICANS PERFORMING IN CUBA PICKS UP  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
 - CUBA-EXCHANGE-NYT  
 (ATTN:   Caribbean, Md., Calif.)  By PETER WATROUS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Dec. 31, 1958, the pianist Byron Janis performed in Santiago
de Cuba for an audience of ecstatic upper-class Cubans and nervous
soldiers _ Fidel Castro was coming down from the hills to take
over. The next day Castro arrived, and Janis left for New York. He
was one of the last American musicians to perform in
pre-revolutionary Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after 40 years of hostility between the two countries and
an American economic blockade that restricts travel to Cuba, Janis
will be performing in Havana next month. He won't be there alone.
</P>
<P>
   The next few months may be unprecedented in the cultural history
of post-revolutionary Cuba as a stream of American performers and
arts organizations travel to the island in the wake of the pope's
visit last year and the Clinton administration's easing of
restrictions last month to make cultural exchange easier. Janis was
invited by the Cuban government and given the green light by the
U.S. Treasury Department, which enforces the Helms-Burton Act, the
1996 measure that tightened economic sanctions against the
Communist Cuban state even further.
</P>
<P>
   This month, a segment of MTV's ``Road Rules'' will be filmed in
Havana, with cast members shown playing baseball and listening to
music at a nightclub. The Baltimore Orioles are negotiating an
exhibition game with the Cuban national team next month. George C.
Wolfe, producer of the Joseph Papp Public Theater/New York
Shakespeare Festival in New York, has spent a week in Havana,
scouting a location for ``Bring In da Noise, Bring In da Funk,''
his Tony Award-winning musical history of African-Americans, which
just closed on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of March, a Los Angeles-based organization called
Music Bridges will send some 70 American pop, country and jazz
musicians, ranging from Burt Bacharach and Jimmy Buffett to the
Indigo Girls, to spend a week writing songs with Cuban musicians. A
concert featuring the products of the encounter will take place at
the end of their stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no precedent for anything like Music Bridges at all,''
said William Martinez, a lawyer and promoter based in San Francisco
who specializes in navigating the tricky waters of the Helms-Burton
Act for American groups and individuals that want to travel to
Cuba. He is responsible for bringing in many of the Cuban musical
groups that have been touring the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had asked me if this was possible five years ago,''
Martinez said, ``I would have said no.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago he was suing the United States government to let
a Cuban pop group, Mezcla, come in and tour; the government
refused, but the case solidified public sentiment against the
government's position, which at the time was to refuse most
requests. Martinez lost that case, but now the floodgates have
opened, and Cuban dance, theater and music groups of all kinds have
been crisscrossing the country.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Martinez says, visa delays are likely to be the
result of volume, not intransigence. Tours by Cuban bands have
become routine, and even in Miami, where anti-Castro Cuban exile
groups would protest any sort of nonhostile communication between
the countries, Cuban bands playing Saturday night parties are now
commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   What is new in the cultural exchange is the desire and ability
of American artists to perform in Cuba. Travel to the island, legal
and illegal, has been fashionable for several years; the Marina
Hemingway in Havana is filled with American pleasure boats. There
are official delegations from organizations like the Smithsonian
and Hollywood stars looking to revel in the cigars, rum and night
life of Havana. While the Havana Jazz Festival has intermittently
attracted American musicians, and the Havana Film Festival has
lured visitors from the United States, there has been little
American performance activity till now.
</P>
<P>
   The visit by Pope John Paul II and the easing of some economic
restrictions (although the embargo was not lifted) have brought new
attention to a culture and a country that already was popular among
intellectuals and artists and adventurous tourists willing to enter
illegally through a third country. All this travel begins to
restore a pre-revolutionary relationship between the two countries
that included everything from high culture to sex tourism.
</P>
<P>
   The trips to Cuba are made possible by a provision in the
Helms-Burton Act that allows for intercultural exchange, although
the act generally restricts contact, especially business contact,
between the two countries. Under the provision, those U.S. citizens
who are granted licenses by the Treasury Department, for
educational or cultural purposes, are allowed to visit Cuba but may
not spend more than $100 a day there.
</P>
<P>
   Some opponents of the licensing system say that Treasury
officials are notorious for holding up travel permits. Global
Exchange, a 10-year-old educational travel organization based in
San Francisco, has challenged Helms-Burton by sending American
students and musicians to Cuba through a third country. The
Treasury Department has sent the group notice to cease the Cuba
trips and has frozen the company's assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel the policy is erratic at best,'' said Pam Montanaro,
coordinator of the Cuba program at Global Exchange. ``We're opposed
to the embargo, so they've been hard on us. But the right to travel
is a human right that is recognized by many countries
internationally. For the government to promote democracy in Cuba
while trampling on our human rights here is hypocritical, so we're
going to fight it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department did not respond to repeated requests for
comment. The Cuban government has the most to gain by the
exchanges, attracting not only attention to its economic plight,
but also the support of entertainment figures and the dollars they
may bring. With the loss of Soviet sponsorship, the U.S. embargo
and bad internal economic planning, the country is in financial
shambles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to be gaining anything financially,'' said
Tomas Misas, the director of international relations for the Cuban
government's Institute of Music. ``We're financially in a tough
situation, but I think that finally culture all over the world wins
in programs like this. We're always ready to enrich the culture
through common experience. To get Byron Janis here for many people
is a dream. We're always ready for projects like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Janis, who remembers playing in the Soviet Union during the
crisis that followed the shooting down of an American U-2 plane,
sees his return to Cuba as a logical continuation of his desire to
bring people together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I performed in Cuba before the revolution all the time,''
Janis said. ``The blockade seems like something governmental _ it
really has nothing to do with the people. And my feeling is that
music is the perfect way of bringing the countries together. I hope
that after I've opened the door to classical music, major American
classical stars will start making the trip.''

 &HT;    RALLIES ILLUSTRATE ISRAELI RELIGIOUS RIFT
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A sea of ultra-Orthodox demonstrators in black hats
and dark suits packed a city street Sunday while counter-protesters
in sweatshirts and jeans filled a park nearby, accentuating
Israel's religious-secular cleft.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200,000 ultra-Orthodox were estimated to have turned
out at a major entrance to the city. Called by religious leaders,
their target was the Israeli supreme court, which has recently
eroded some special privileges held by ultra-Orthodox Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``We demand from the judicial branch not to intervene in matters
of religion and to stop interfering in matters of (scriptures),''
said rally leader Rabbi Menachem Porush.
</P>
<P>
   A half mile away, about 50,000 secular Jews met to support the
court.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must understand this is a war, a war over the character of
our beloved country,'' Yossi Sarid, leader of the left-wing Meretz
party, told the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations on the first day of the work week came off
without any of the expected clashes that had drawn 1,500 police to
ring the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   The rallies were probably the largest of the their type ever,
and they represented a crest in what many call a ``culture war''
within the small nation.
</P>
<P>
   Ultra-Orthodox Jews, though perhaps only 10 percent of the
population, have wielded a strong influence by serving as a
tie-breaking faction in the Israeli parliament.
</P>
<P>
   In a country without an official separation of religion and
government, ultra-Orthodox Jews have been able to win exemptions
from mandatory military service, government subsidies for lifetimes
of study in religious schools, and heavy funding for religious
schools.
</P>
<P>
   They see themselves as preserving the Jewish nature of the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   But as they have grown in number, their special status has
angered most Israelis, who are Jewish but do not practice organized
religion.
</P>
<P>
   American Jews have been angered at Orthodox efforts to exclude
those in less traditional forms of Judaism, such as Reform and
Conservative, from sharing power in government religious councils.
</P>
<P>
   As secular advocates have won recent court challenges against
the Orthodox, Orthodox leaders have lambasted the courts. They have
called the head of the court, himself Jewish, a ``persecutor of the
Jews'' and ``anti-semitic.'' Banners at the rally decried the
``judicial assaults on the Jewish faith.''
</P>
<P>
   The gathering Sunday was a mass prayer meeting _ toned down from
plans for a political rally at the request of Israeli leaders. With
the blowing of the traditional ram's horn, men gathered in the
streets and rocked back and forth in prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the men wore the black fedoras or skullcaps, beards and
side curls distinctive of the ultra-Orthodox.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with Orthodox traditions for segregated prayer, women
were kept to the sides of the protest, on balconies and a raised
street nearby.
</P>
<P>
   At the secular rally, a mix of male and female demonstrators
banged bongo drums and wore jeans and sweatshirts. Some bared their
midriffs on the unseasonably warm day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want my country to be only a religious country,'' said
15-year-old Ganit(cq) Bendel, who came on a bus from her kibbutz, a
collective Israeli farm, and was wearing secular bumper stickers
across the front of her blouse. ``I want anybody to live the way
they want.''

`MISANTHROPE':   MOLIERE'S SAVAGES LOSE OUT TO TODAY'S 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: England ) (EDS: Production notes at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; NEW YORK _ ``There's nothing remotely naive about you,'' hisses
Alceste, the brooding, middle-aged playwright, to Jennifer, the
intelligent, luminous young movie star. Since Jennifer is being
portrayed by the intelligent, luminous young movie star Uma
Thurman, it would seem difficult to quarrel with this assessment.
As a screen presence Ms. Thurman hasn't really registered as naive
since her virginal, teen-aged character in ``Dangerous Liaisons''
was debauched by John Malkovich a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the Classic Stage Company's production of Martin Crimp's
contemporary adaptation of Moliere's ``Misanthrope,'' Ms. Thurman
gives off an uneasy innocence that would doubtless cause much
lip-curling among the wry, worldly and exotic women she has essayed
beguilingly in films like ``Henry and June,'' ``Pulp Fiction'' and
``Batman and Robin.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, cast against the finely seasoned English actor Roger Rees
in the title role and forced to speak in intricate, rhymed
couplets, she brings to mind a beautiful, sheltered girl at her
first grown-up dance, putting on airs and hoping against hope
she'll get away with it.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there's a game, likable quality to Ms. Thurman's
performance, but it goes against the grain of Crimp's take on ``The
Misanthrope,'' which isn't likable at all. In transporting
Moliere's study of 17th-century hypocrites and the brooding
Alceste's one-man war against them into the London theater world of
today, the work is intent on outsavaging its dark satiric source.
</P>
<P>
   The point appears to be that compared with their latter-day
counterparts, the courtiers and dilettantes of the age of Louis XIV
were pikers in the practice of surface worship and self-interest.
But after you get past the initial jolt of the script's novelty _
the barbed allusions to current cultural figures ranging from David
Hare to Tina Brown, the use of jargon both academic and obscene _
an unrelieved sourness sets in. You experience that sinking feeling
that arrives when you're seated at a dinner party at a table of
people you know you're not going to like and who aren't quite
monstrous enough to be skewered in amusingly horrified anecdotes
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Misanthrope'' is the first production to be staged at
Classic Stage Company by its new artistic director, Barry
Edelstein, who was responsible for the warm, compassionate revival
of ``All My Sons'' two seasons ago. Clearly, much thought and labor
have gone into this ``Misanthrope.'' Narelle Sisson's set,
representing the sort of trendy London hotel room in which a mirror
is the most important piece of furniture, and Martin Pakledinaz's
devoutly hip costumes have acid flair.
</P>
<P>
   Edelstein alos has assembled a seriously talented cast. In
addition to Rees (in a role, it should be noted, he was born for)
and Ms. Thurman, there are Michael Emerson (the Oscar Wilde of
``Gross Indecency'') and Adina Porter (of Suzan-Lori Parks'
``Venus''), playing, respectively, John, the conciliatory best
friend of the humanity-hating Alceste, and Ellen, a ``radical
post-feminist journalist.'' That phrase, incidentally, sums up the
tone of characterization in this ``Misanthrope,'' in which
everyone, excepting Alceste and to a lesser degree Jennifer, can be
reduced to a familiar epithet.
</P>
<P>
   Crimp, who did the wonderful translation for the production of
Ionesco's ``Chairs'' seen on Broadway last season, has said he was
trying to recreate the satiric impact of the original
``Misanthrope,'' quoting Moliere's dictum that, in comedy, ``if you
don't make recognizable portraits of the contemporary world, then
nothing's been achieved.''
</P>
<P>
   Fresh satire, however, comes hard in a world in which the
morning's headlines are the evening's one-liners. Crimp fills his
text with all sorts of pretentious argot, from psychobabble to
semiotics. (Says one character of a developing relationship with
another, ``To do it justice, we'd really need to start/a dialogue
with Derrida or Roland Barthes.'')
</P>
<P>
   But what's remotely new about making fun of these assumed
postures? This ``Misanthrope'' is all brand-name details without
any sense of underlying insight.
</P>
<P>
   It's as if the play had been styled to the teeth rather than
fully reconceived, a superficial treatment of a superficial world.
Crimp has obviously enjoyed himself creating the kind of couplets
in which ``linguistic formality'' is rhymed with ``virtual
reality,'' and sometimes that pleasure translates to the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in Moliere's plays the precise poetry matched the highly
structured world of court life, whereas there is no such intrinsic
connection here, and most of the actors seem only fitfully
comfortable with the text. Ms. Porter injects a buzz of arch
self-importance to Ellen's polysyllabic pronouncements that can be
very funny, while Emerson, his delivery curling at the edges, is
the soul of genial, ironic detachment.
</P>
<P>
   But it's Mary Lou Rosato, as an aging, vengeful acting coach,
and Nick Wyman, as a corrupt and fatuous drama critic (is there any
other kind?), who among the supporting cast come closest to
creating full portraits. Paired one on one with Rees, they actually
manage to generate some dramatic sparks, while giving the welcome
and rare impression that everyone onstage is speaking the same
language.
</P>
<P>
   Although Alceste, Moliere's most complicated and potentially
tragic character, has lost a few levels of depth in this version,
Rees is first rate. He invests the role with compelling,
self-dramatizing bile and energy, and even his gelled hair seems to
be standing up in indignation. Unfortunately, accepting his
character is contingent on accepting his love of Jennifer (the
coquette Celimene in Moliere's original), and Ms. Thurman simply
isn't commanding enough in the part.
</P>
<P>
   In physical terms it's hard to imagine anyone not falling for
this tall, pale candle of a woman, except possibly someone with a
fear of heights. But in striving to project from a stage, even in
this tiny theater, Ms. Thurman exaggerates her gestures and
delivery with pained self-consciousness. Her valuable stock in
trade on screen, a sly, feline confidence, evaporates here.
</P>
<P>
   She has her moments, including a brutal confrontation with Rees
that suggests the strange, misguided interdependence between their
two characters. She's irresistible when she sinuously stretches her
arms above her head, happily announcing, ``I am the complete focus
of all attention, yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thurman is herself the inevitable focus of attention in this
production, and it's a shame that her introduction as a theater
star to New York audiences should be so shaky. Jennifer remarks:
``The media's fascination with me isn't my fault. They need an
icon.'' The strangest thing about this ``Misanthrope'' is that Ms.
Thurman has never seemed less iconic than here.
</P>

ANALYSIS: SMALL COMPANIES ARE FOOTNOTES IN U.S. VS. MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.) (With MICROSOFT-LANGUAGE) 
(nk) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The pawns in the Microsoft trial are the smaller
companies whose business practices have been scrutinized and then
thrown into the spotlight of courtroom debate to bolster the case
of either Microsoft or the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Companies used this way in the last couple of weeks have
included Red Hat Software, Netcom, Caldera and Be Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of these companies are not brought to court.
Instead, lawyers for the opposing sides offer as evidence accounts
from the news media, World Wide Web pages, even product packaging
and documentation, to make the case that a company agrees with, or
finds itself at odds with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   But that does not mean the company's leaders are blind to what
is happening. When Be was the subject of debate for several days
early this month, Jean-Louis Gassee, its chief executive, read news
accounts and poured over trial transcripts he found on the
Internet. At the end, Gassee said, ``Microsoft has a lot of nerve
using my tiny company as an example.''
</P>
<P>
   Gassee was not called as a witness; the Justice Department's and
Microsoft's legal teams are limited to 12 witnesses each, forcing
the two sides to find other ways to make their points on everything
but the most important issues.
</P>
<P>
   It is a bit like trying to analyze government practices in North
Korea by interviewing a few ill-informed exiles. But that has not
stopped both sides from plunging ahead, even when a little deeper
investigation would show that the truth is different from the
courtroom representation.
</P>
<P>
   That is certainly the case with Be. The company first figured in
the trial in January, when Microsoft lawyers and witnesses pointed
to Be as a potential competitive threat. Be was formed in 1990 and
now employs 90 people at its headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. The
Be operating system, known as the BeOS, is installed on about
20,000 personal computers worldwide, most of them used for
specialized purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It amuses me that they call me a competitive threat,'' Gassee
said. ``But it's perplexing. One might question the motives. My
strategy is peaceful coexistence with Microsoft because it would be
suicidal to compete with them.''
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 1, Microsoft began using Be for another strategic
purpose. In a videotaped demonstration created by James Allchin, a
senior Microsoft executive, the BeOS was held up as an operating
system with an integrated Web browser, just like Windows 98. This
showed that Microsoft was simply following common industry
practices, Allchin suggested.
</P>
<P>
   But that tape set off two days of additional demonstrations,
with Microsoft trying to prove that Net Positive, Be's browser, was
integrated into the BeOS and the Justice Department displaying
screen shots from a computer running BeOS to prove that the the
browser could be deleted and thus was not an integrated part of the
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft then displayed excerpts from the Be instruction manual
showing that browser program files were held in a system directory
that users were warned not to alter.
</P>
<P>
   Gassee said he was perplexed by Microsoft's assertion about the
program files because that was true only in an older version, which
was phased out late last year. And, he said, he knows that
Microsoft has copies of the new version, Release 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the names of BeOS purchasers with addresses ending in
microsoft.com,'' he said. ``They bought a number of copies, and we
thank them for their business _ which is to say they don't have a
good excuse for referring to older documentation.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Murray, a Microsoft spokesman, said he thought the
demonstration was videotaped in October, when BeOs Release 3.02 was
still in use. ``There may be a new version,'' he said. ``But that's
the one we had.''
</P>
<P>
   In Be's Release 4, the browser files are held in the
applications directory with no warnings not to delete them. And
Gassee insists that despite Microsoft's best efforts to use his
company as a pawn, Net Positive is not integrated into the BeOS any
more than Excel or Word are integrated into Windows, even though
they are often installed on new computers along with Windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you delete the word processor, you can't write documents
anymore,'' he said. ``When you delete the print driver, you can't
print. And when you delete the Web browser _ take Net Positive and
drag it to the trash _ you can't browse the Web anymore. That's
all.''
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft made an additional point. Just as is true with
Windows 98, the BeOS requires a browser to display help files,
which are written in hypertext markup language, or HTML, the
formatting standard for Web pages. When the browser is deleted, the
help system does not work properly, just as is true with Windows
98.
</P>
<P>
   Gassee says that formatting help files in HTML does not mean
that the browser is integrated, and the arguments on both sides
fall into the realm of technological theology. There is no clear
definition. But Gassee insists that just because one program calls
on features of another does not mean the two are integrated.
``Let's say you have a Word document and you paste a spreadsheet
from Excel in it and edit it,'' he said. ``If you remove Excel from
the the system, you can't do that anymore. That does not make Excel
integrated into Windows?''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Gassee said he wished the BeOS help system did not
rely on the browser. It would be easy, he added, to make the HTML
reader a part of the operating system instead of a function of the
browser, so that both Net Positive and the help system could use
it.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Microsoft did something similar, incorporating what it
calls an ``HTML engine'' into Windows 98 as a part of its Internet
Explorer browser. As a result, all the applications in its
forthcoming Office 2000 suite, including Word and Excel, can read
and write files in HTML format.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have done that,'' Gassee said. ``But there were
scheduling issues. We wanted to get the product out as fast as
possible.''

MICROSOFT DENIES RUMORS THAT IT IS CRAFTING A LANGUAGE LIKE JAVA
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Calif.)  (See MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST) 
( nk ) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Microsoft Corp. is playing down a report in Monday's PC
Week, a trade magazine, that the software giant has been briefing
software developers on a new programming language that would be
similar to Sun Microsystems Inc.'s Java software, but free of
technological or licensing obligations to Sun.
</P>
<P>
   Sun recently won a court order blocking Microsoft from shipping
products containing Microsoft's own version of Java, which Sun
claims has been altered to work only with Microsoft Windows, thus
thwarting the so-called cross-platform capability designed into the
language. Cross platform means that a developer can write one
version of a program in Java, which can then run on Windows,
Macintosh, Unix and other software operating systems. Microsoft is
appealing the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear why software developers, who have embraced Java
enthusiastically, would be interested in a new programming
language. But analysts predicted that Microsoft would work hard to
win the role of intellectual leadership that a dominant programming
language confers within the developer community. And it is Java and
its steaming coffee cup logo _ not Windows _ that are synonymous
with the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   The PC Week article quoted unnamed software developers who said
they had been briefed on a Java language alternative code-named
``Cool.''
</P>
<P>
   However, none of the developers offered any details about the
nature of such a program, not even whether or not it would be
cross-platform. The article, which was heavily promoted by PC
Week's public relations staff late last week, offered no clue as to
what the product really is, who would use it or when it would ship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems Microsoft at this point is not willing to give more
than a broad outline,'' said Eric Lundquist, PC Week's editor in
chief. ``It may be it is something they're working on in their labs
and they're trying to get feedback.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Risse, Microsoft's product manager for application
development tools, said Cool was simply one of a number of new
ideas under discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have we discussed something like this? Yes. Are we developing
anything? No, we are not,'' he said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Of 800 employees in the development tools unit, ``not one _
zero, nada _ is working on or developing any new language,'' he
said. ``That's the case today and for the foreseeable future.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Poulson, a spokeswoman for Sun, said that rumors had been
circulating for two years that Microsoft was at work on a so-called
universal virtual machine that would conceivably enable its
operating systems or applications to run Java programs without
employing any Java technology themselves. Such a piece of code
would fall far short of a new language, but Microsoft already has
two programming languages, C++ and Visual Basic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Separately, they did ask the judge if they could build
independently developed works, and they were specific in their
court papers about a compiler,'' Ms. Poulson said. A compiler is a
programming tool that converts high-level languages, like C++ or
Java, into the machine code of ones and zeros that computers
understand.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Ronald Whyte, of United States District Court in San Jose,
Calif., has not yet ruled on Microsoft's request. But at any rate,
Risse said the concept called Cool is unconnected to the lawsuit.

`MOSES UND ARON':   AN OPERA HINTS AT MOSES AS SCHOENBERG'S ALTER
EGO 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By   EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The queasiness is unrelenting. Revelation inspires a
form of nausea in Arnold Schoenberg's opera, ``Moses und Aron,''
now being given its first Metropolitan Opera performances. But that
nausea comes not from disgust, but from disorientation. The ear
canals are jostled and jiggered by the studious avoidance of
familiar harmonic guideposts. When there are echoes of familiar
dances _ a march, a waltz _ the stomping emphasis of the rhythms
lands on puddles of slippery mercury.
</P>
<P>
   Even at the opening of this brain-wrought rendering of the
Exodus story, when we hear God's voice from the burning bush, the
music does not bring us ear to ear with a transcendent power. There
is no sublime grandeur, no awe-inspiring mystery. Instead the
revelation is overwhelmingly weird, an unsettling combination of
six voices mixing song and speech and whine and whisper. The sound
is an eerie trace of something that lies beyond common experience.
We don't hear revelation. But we do hear its distorted residue.
</P>
<P>
   Which is probably pretty close to what Schoenberg wanted, since
this opera _ one of the musical landmarks of this century _ is
about futile attempts to express an idea that lies beyond
expression, an idea that is, as Moses solemnly chants, both
unperceivable and inconceivable. Moses, slow of speech, is granted
a vision of the ineffable, while Aron, who can give the revelation
voice and public meaning, distorts it along the way.
</P>
<P>
   The Met's new production by Graham Vick, which creates a mixture
of hauntingly beautiful images and stupefyingly banal distortions,
adds to the unease in a strange fashion. It inadvertently shows how
ill-understood the opera and its ideas remain, a half-century after
Schoenberg's death.
</P>
<P>
   Schoenberg, in his writings, left little doubt about what the
stakes were in this drama. For all his stature as a highly rational
modernist, in his views of artistry he was a religious Romantic,
opposed to what he called ``sterile faith in science.'' He kept
circling around religious dramas, while leaving them incomplete: an
oratorio about Jacob, a play, ``The Biblical Way,'' ``Moses und
Aron.'' He spoke of musical composition as a form of ``miracle''
and suggested that the artist ``feels as if what he does were
dictated to him,'' as if he were acting as a ``mouthpiece'' of a
higher power.
</P>
<P>
   This puts the composer in the position of Moses at the burning
bush. But Schoenberg argued that something wasn't right, that in
this century music's language was no longer capable of giving shape
to new revelations. Schoenberg in essence became a law-giver, a
Moses, constructing a musical system that would guide music's
future.
</P>
<P>
   But how would such a revelation be communicated? In the opera
Aron does the job. He is seductive, manipulative, translating the
gnomic proclamations of his brother into tenorial display that
might sway an audience as skeptical as any Schoenberg ever
encountered. The listeners doubt that Moses will return from the
mountain with their law. So Aron decides to give them what they
want.
</P>
<P>
   ``I return your gods to you,'' he says, ``and also give you to
them, just as you have demanded.'' The result is the golden calf,
which is celebrated in an extended musical scene of debauchery,
butchery and sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   This is nail-scratching, nail-biting music with a primitive
vitality and sweep. There may even be suggestions, in the midst of
the idolatrous bacchanal, of Schoenberg's early sickly
Expressionism along with music of composers who did not accept
Schoenberg's declarations of musical law: invocations of the
primitivism of Stravinsky (as in ``Rite of Spring'') and the
sensuous grotesqueries of Richard Strauss (as in ``Salome''). That
music, with its suggestions of energy and decadence, tapped into an
audience larger than Schoenberg's later compositions ever did.
</P>
<P>
   What happens when Moses/Schoenberg returns, severe and
unforgiving, with the revelatory law and its promise of salvation?
</P>
<P>
   Aron argues that Moses' pride is unjustified, that even those
laws are nothing but images, inevitably distorting, no better than
the calf itself. (Aron is not just a Romantic tenor, he is a
post-modern tenor). Moses smashes the tablets. ``Thus am I
defeated!'' he cries. ``O word, thou word, that I lack!''
</P>
<P>
   Schoenberg planned another twist, but his account of Moses'
rehabilitation _ and his own _ was never completed. Only a portion
of the originally planned libretto exists. In it Aron is condemned
by Moses for having betrayed ``the extraordinary to the
commonplace,'' having ``abandoned the wasteland's renunciation.''
</P>
<P>
   He is condemned for indulging in sensuous imagery, for pandering
to his people, for abandoning the rigors of modernist solitude. For
not being Arnold Schoenberg.
</P>
<P>
   I think the opera really was this personally urgent for
Schoenberg, which is why he had such trouble finishing it. At stake
were his very achievements as a composer. Was his compositional
system as arbitrary as Aron suggested? How could his music live
without the distortion of Aron? How could it survive intact without
the ruthlessness of Moses?
</P>
<P>
   The result of his modernist severity could only be a bizarre
isolation, in which everything falls short of the ideal. In
Schoenberg's unfinished play, ``The Biblical Way,'' a high priest
proclaims the futility of this quest, arguing, ``He who dedicates
himself to the idea should either renounce the temptation of its
fulfillment, or resign himself to a reality that he would rather
not have to live. This is why all those who are impelled to live
out an idea become martyrs to it.''
</P>
<P>
   What hope would any society have where the only choices were
resignation or renunciation? What opera could ever convincingly
reconcile these alternatives? How could such music even hope to
find an audience when finding an audience is seen as a compromise?
</P>
<P>
   Now that the orthodoxies of modernist visions like Schoenberg's
have passed, we might think we see things more clearly: Moses and
Aron offer incomplete visions, though both are needed. But
post-modern interpretations like Graham Vick's end up adding more
distortions.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the revelation is treated as something immutable,
inexpressible and inconceivable. There is no ideal. Aron's
interpretations can become ever more arbitrary, Moses' authority
more open to question. In this context, the bacchanal can hardly
seem like an outrage; there is no idea of order to be opposed.
</P>
<P>
   This is the problem with the production at the Met, which even
ends up importing political and cultural villains to inspire
disgust. The scene with the golden calf is staged as a series of
vignettes involving the nemesis of the 20th-century avant-garde,
the decadent bourgeoisie: models in luxurious furs (with blood on
the inside lining), hypocritical politicians, plastic surgeons and
their victims and even an array of Hasidim.
</P>
<P>
   Of course Schoenberg himself had no great love for the bourgeois
audience. But here familiar idols and villains are propped up and
left to make polemical and incidental points, while the mission of
Moses seems haplessly incidental to the chaos. The opera itself is
more ambiguous, more discomfiting and more confounding.
</P>
<P>
   It poses questions about the tensions between high art and mass
acclaim, hermetic systems and pandering entertainments, immutable
law and unfettered abandon. Its challenge _ that some Aron be brave
enough to give its flawed revelations public voice _ remains
unanswered.

AFTER IMPEACHMENT, IS THERE STILL WASHINGTON NEWS?

   WASHINGTON _ Call Chris Matthews an optimist. In the brand new
studios of the CNBC show ``Hardball With Chris Matthews,'' where he
has spent the last year turning impeachment into entertainment,
Matthews says he is actually upbeat about the end of the scandal
that helped double his audience in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In its birth, my show is the same as ABC's `Nightline' was,''
he said. `` `Nightline' was born during the Iran hostage crisis.
They survived. We've been introduced as a program covering one big
ongoing story.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, he said, as the Year of Monica comes to a close, he is
prepared for the New Age. ``Jury nullification,'' he said,
gesturing toward an article in The Washington Post. Delivered with
the right insight and attitude, he said, talk about angry jurors
protesting the law by letting defendants go free can get just as
many people to tune in.
</P>
<P>
   His colleagues around Washington are not so optimistic, about
his prospects or their own. Interviews with two dozen reporters,
news executives and scholars found growing concern about the
general public's interest in news from the capital, as long as the
economy flourishes and American troops are not in harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington and politics used to be the hub of the news
wheel,'' said S. Robert Lichter, president of the Center for Media
and Public Affairs. ``Now it's just another spoke.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington news increasingly attracts enthusiasts rather than a
general audience, said Thomas B. Rosenstiel, director of the
Project for Excellence in Journalism. ``Our mass media depends on
an audience that no longer exists _ a mass audience which is now
fragmented,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Niche audiences are the bread and butter of cable television,
with its channels for gardening and weather and now for Washington
news. CNN's ``Larry King Live'' scored its best ratings in 1998,
averaging 1.3 million households. ``Hardball'' reached an average
of 552,000 homes in 1998, up from an average of 252,000 in 1997,
its first year.
</P>
<P>
   Compare the effects of the scandal on the evening news
broadcasts of three major networks. In 1998, 44 percent of all the
Washington news reports on the evening broadcasts were about the
scandal, according to the Center for Media and Public Affairs.
Since September, these linchpins of the nation's general news
coverage have lost more than two million households a night _
roughly the same total as the audiences of ``Larry King Live,''
``Hardball'' and CNBC's ``Rivera Live'' combined.
</P>
<P>
   David Poltrack, vice president for audience research for CBS,
supervised those network audience calculations. ``For the past two
years, while network ratings in general were declining, the most
resilient ratings were those of the three evening newscasts,'' he
said. Since September, he added, those programs have lost almost 6
percent of their combined audience.
</P>
<P>
   The press corps that will now try to lure readers and viewers to
news of Washington government and politics has changed in some
fundamental ways in the last 25 years. When Richard Nixon resigned
in 1974, newspaper and wire service reporters in Washington
accredited to cover Congress outnumbered broadcasters almost 2 to
1. As the Lewinsky scandal ends, that ratio is now 3 to 2 in favor
of the radio and television journalists and technicians.
</P>
<P>
   Specialty reporting, mostly involving business and finance, has
blossomed, while more traditional beat coverage of Cabinet
departments like Interior, Transportation, or Agriculture is
increasingly episodic.
</P>
<P>
   The generalists have hardly disappeared _ the bureaus of Reuters
(with 55 staff members accredited to cover Congress during the
1997-1998 session) and The Associated Press (95) have near-record
staff levels. And television programs like ``News Hour With Jim
Lehrer'' on PBS provide wide-ranging and deep coverage (it had
nearly 50 staff members accredited to cover the last session of
Congress.)
</P>
<P>
   But more of the Washington press corps than ever covers news
tailored to the audience's business interests _ witness the rise of
the financial news services Bloomberg News (35 Congress
accreditations) and Bridge News (30). More journalists than ever
cover the city for a Washington-centric audience _ witness the rise
of the C-SPAN cable channels (135 journalists accredited by
Congress) and Hotline, the online daily Washington news bulletin
distributed by The National Journal.
</P>
<P>
   In this increasingly splintered universe, some general news
organizations are realigning. Peter Copeland, the new bureau chief
for the Scripps-Howard newspaper chain, is redirecting coverage to
new beats like consumer affairs and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   At the Knight Ridder bureau, the focus on daily coverage will
dwindle, bureau editors say. Instead of assigning nine of its 14
Washington reporters to daily coverage, the bureau will devote 10
reporters to in-depth coverage of subjects like health, economics
and science.
</P>
<P>
   At coming meetings, news executives and representatives from
CNN's 35 bureaus will discuss similar changes. Rick Kaplan,
president of CNN/USA, said he wanted to reorganize the network's
coverage, including Washington's, around ``nine major subjects'' _
education, religion, culture, family, money, saving cities,
changing world, health and the Year 2000 problem.
</P>
<P>
   This shift, he hopes, will reduce the network's dependence on
big stories.
</P>
<P>
   The press corps has changed in other ways. Senior journalists
who were sought out by top government figures once had a virtual
monopoly on conveying the gist of policy debates. Now those
officials can appear on cable programs and explain their views
without any filters.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Stacks, an executive editor at Time magazine who is
writing a biography of the late James Reston, a columnist and
editor of The New York Times, said columnists like Reston or Joseph
Alsop would have background briefings with presidents and senators,
ask hard questions, and then dissect government policy in print.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spin ethic, as opposed to the patient, off-the-record,
background explanation, has destroyed those people, destroyed the
need for them,'' he said. Other journalists, however, point out
that many officials still court influential journalists. It is just
that fewer influential journalists work for newspapers and more are
hosts of television programs.
</P>
<P>
   But if cable's rise has eclipsed some journalists, it has
elevated others with different, more television-friendly skills
such as coming up with well-turned quips that crystallize a
political situation. ``Now the value is edge and attitude,'' Stacks
said.
</P>

<P>
   Edge, attitude and speed. Fast-forward from the 1960s to the
``Hardball'' set in 1999, to see some of the new permutations of
the journalistic craft. It is Monday, the beginning of the last
week of President Clinton's Senate trial. King Hussein of Jordan
has just died, but the talk of Washington's journalistic and
political circles this morning is journalist Christopher Hitchens.
</P>
<P>
   An affidavit from Hitchens recounting a lunch at which, he said,
the presidential aide Sidney Blumenthal called Monica Lewinsky a
``stalker'' is on the mind of Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-Fla., who is
scheduled to appear on the first segment of the program.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews wants the latest news on his program; Adam Levine, the
senior producer, is trying to fit all the elements of the show
together. The bookers and producers fill his office as he rattles
off the plans for the program's six segments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we really have room for Hitchens?'' one of the assembled
producers asked. ``I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you're right,'' Levine replied. ``You can't bump Al
Haig.'' Former Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. is another
scheduled guest.
</P>
<P>
   In the final lineup, Graham's version of the impeachment news
got top billing, but Haig and the funeral of King Hussein got more
time. The show closed with an author talking about a new book on
Muhammad Ali. Such a show _ a mixture of subjects and pacing _ will
survive even without scandal, Matthews says.
</P>
<P>
   The point, he said, is not so much what the news is but how it
is presented. Matthews, who is also the Washington bureau chief of
The San Francisco Examiner, said he seeks to explain ``the subtexts
in political scripts.'' He sees ``Hardball'' as a direct descendant
of ``The Tonight Show'' of the 1970s. ``Johnny Carson brought
audiences into a backstage conversation about Hollywood,'' he said.
``This is a backstage conversation about politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Out in central Kentucky, where Jim Ogle is news director of
WKYT-TV in Lexington, which reaches about 500,000 households, the
audience wants no part of any such conversation. ``The anger that
people in my church and civic groups feel is intense,'' Ogle said.
``They're saying, `Please just stop telling us about it.'''
</P>
<P>
   In early November, he decreed that no report out of Washington
could be broadcast in the first eight minutes of his 90-minute
early evening news program. His ratings for November were the best
in that CBS affiliate's history. Since the change, the show has
captured 40 percent of the viewing audience, about half the size of
the average audience for ``Hardball'' in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Luecke, the editor of The Lexington Herald-Leader, was
somewhat friendlier to Washington news when she and editors of 30
other Knight Ridder newspapers were polled by the company late last
year about what kind of Washington news they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   A majority called for less daily coverage, with the editors of
The Philadelphia Inquirer strongly dissenting.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the scandal, Ms. Luecke said, she wants
``coverage out of Washington that will focus on how the government
is moving on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that the House and the Senate can get into meaty
issues like Social Security and Medicare, we could use some good
`explainers,''' Ms. Luecke said, referring to in-depth analyses of
policy.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Her tastes are traditional. Explainers are a staple of
newspapers and newsmagazines, of programs like ABC's ``Nightline''
and of correspondents like CNN's Jeff Greenfield. But they may not
be the stuff of Matthews' program.
</P>
<P>
   On the set of ``Hardball,'' after expressing his gung-ho
enthusiasm for the subject of jury nullification, Matthews
explained that his show needed to keep up a brisk pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a news program,'' he said. ``People aren't tuning
me in for news. They're tuning me in as an alternative to
`Friends.' ''

`IL TROVATORE': A VERDIAN CHALLENGE, A DREARY PRODUCTION
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Despite its familiarity, ``Il Trovatore'' remains one
of Verdi's most challenging, and hardest-to-cast, operas. It came
at a crossroads in the composer's career, when he was still imbued
with the bel canto heritage yet breaking new ground. So the main
roles want singers who can shape florid melodic lines, yet who have
dramatic depth and resplendent vocal presence. If it's difficult to
find a great cast for, say, ``La Traviata,'' it's difficult to find
any cast at all for ``Il Trovatore.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first ``Trovatore'' of its season, the Metropolitan
Opera's cast was always creditable, and often much more. Given the
demands of this opera, that is saying a lot.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian tenor Richard Margison, as the troubadour Manrico,
who is leading a band of warriors in 15th-century Spain against the
throne of Aragon, has a vibrant and sizable voice, with a bright
ping in the top range. But he lacks subtlety. He is a hefty-framed
man, and his singing can get pretty hefty as well. So for all the
charisma of his sound, he can be a bit bland. But there was
pleasure in hearing a genuinely gifted Verdi tenor take on this
role. He doesn't have much competition right now.
</P>
<P>
   When the American soprano Michele Crider made her Met debut in
1997 as Madama Butterfly, she seemed a very promising new artist.
Returning as Leonora, she still seems a singer just shy of being
completely comfortable. Still, her sound is luscious, and she ably
handled the role's coloratura flights, high-lying pianissimo
phrases and lurching melodic lines. But in her sometimes cautious
placement of notes, and her sometimes labored breathing, there was
a sense of not being quite in control. Still, hers is a beautiful
voice, and this was an affecting performance.
</P>
<P>
   The powerhouse Russian mezzo-soprano Larissa Diadkova was
commanding as the Gypsy woman Azucena, singing with throbbing
intensity yet solid musicianship. The high B-flat Verdi takes the
character up to is not a happy note for her. But this was an
impressive performance by an exceptional singer.
</P>
<P>
   It will take more hearings to know what the Mexican baritone
Genaro Sulvaran, who made his debut as the Count di Luna, is
capable of. He has an essentially robust, dark-hued voice and sings
with dramatic vigor. But he was more concerned with unleashing
fortissimo top notes than in shaping Verdi's elegant phrasing.
</P>
<P>
   He may have been confounded by the dreary 1987 Fabrizio Melano
production, dominated by a stage-wide staircase and massive, moving
black columns, all dimly lighted and veiled by a scrim. At times it
seemed as if Sulvaran was being subjected to some trial of
initiation: ``Go stand up on that stairway behind that screen and
sing `Il Balen.'''
</P>
<P>
   The production may have also hampered the young German conductor
Jun Maerkl in his Met debut. He is an alert, musical, technically
skilled conductor with an idiomatic sensitivity for the ebbs and
flows of Verdian lines. The occasional moments of poor ensemble may
have been a result of the singers' and chorus' being stuck in the
dark abyss of the stage, far removed from their conductor.
</P>
<P>
   The tireless bass Paul Plishka, who sang Ferrando, continues to
be a model of vocal, musical and dramatic professionalism.

EPA'S ACCIDENT PLANS CATALYZE AN INTERNET CONTROVERSY
</HEADLINE>
   ( nk ) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The chairman of the House Commerce Committee, Rep &UR; .
 &LR; Thomas J. Bliley Jr., R-Va., is considering legislation that would
put limits on the types of publicly released government information
that could be posted on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are the ``worst case scenario'' plans for handling
accidents that the Environmental Protection Agency is collecting
from the nation's 66,000 chemical plants and chemical storage sites
under the Clean Air Act.
</P>
<P>
   The information is to be released to the public in June, and the
EPA originally intended to post it on its World Wide Web site in
the form of a searchable data base. But Bliley and officials from
intelligence agencies began objecting last year, saying that the
EPA would be creating an Internet road map for terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups and community advocates, however, say easy
public access to the data is necessary to help prepare for a much
greater risk _ that of accidental spills of dangerous chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA has dropped its plans to post the data on its Web site.
But at a hearing on the matter last week, Bliley said he remained
concerned that environmental groups would obtain the information
through the Freedom of Information Act and post it on their own
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Bliley has not specifically said that he is considering
legislation to limit what can be posted on the Internet. But a
spokesman for Bliley said legislation dealing with the issue was
imminent. And the issue was clearly on his mind in calling the
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Several of his supporters grilled witnesses from the EPA and the
FBI about terrorist concerns. And after the meeting, Bliley's
office issued a news release contending that an EPA official had
agreed the information ``should not be posted on the Internet by
the government or any other party.''
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of Internet advocacy groups has asked Bliley to
reconsider filing legislation, saying that any proposals to limit
the distribution of the data electronically would set a dangerous
precedent for limiting public access to nonclassified government
documents.

<P>
   LONDON _ The Royal Opera House in Covent Garden is still a huge
construction site, but completion of its $360 million redevelopment
is now in view. Inside its horseshoe auditorium, while seats and
carpets have yet to be installed, a large medallion of Queen
Victoria's profile, placed above the proscenium 140 years ago, has
been regilded in anticipation of the house's reopening on Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if London's arts lovers have barely noticed this pricey
metamorphosis, it is because a far more exciting political,
financial and psychological drama has been tearing apart the Royal
Opera House. Until recently the issue has not been how the new
Covent Garden will look but whether the Royal Opera and Royal
Ballet will ever perform there.
</P>
<P>
   For the last three years the Royal Opera House has been a soap
opera. Under three board chairmen and three directors it saw its
deficit mount, its mismanagement exposed and its public image
muddied. Its plans for performances in other theaters during Covent
Garden's current 30-month closing was so badly prepared that the
board canceled most of the 1999-2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   Two departing directors exchanged barbs with the board. The
artistic director for opera, Nicholas Payne, left to run the
English National Opera. The music director, Bernard Haitink,
resigned in frustration in October. In November artists and staff
members picketed 10 Downing Street, while members of the Royal
Ballet contemplated resigning en masse and forming a new ballet
company. Who could stop the rot?
</P>
<P>
   An American in the form of Michael Kaiser, the former executive
director of the American Ballet Theater, arrived here in
mid-November to sort out the warring British. That was not quite
the wording of his mandate as the Royal Opera House's new executive
director, but that in essence was his task. Remarkably 10 weeks
later there are signs that peace is breaking out at Covent Garden.
</P>
<P>
   In December the Arts Council of England, which provides about
one-third of Covent Garden's budget, raised its annual grant by $3
million to $32 million for 1999 and by a further $6.4 million for
2000 and 2001 each. At the same time Haitink withdrew his
resignation and agreements were signed with the opera house unions.
The turmoil inside the Royal Ballet also was settled.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 28 Kaiser unveiled his strategic plan for Covent Garden
which, along with details of the opera and ballet programs through
May 2000, included two innovations carefully designed to improve
the house's public image: Ticket prices will be reduced, and the
building will be open all day for tours, meals and free lunchtime
chamber music concerts in its new 420-seat Studio Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Of course not all this was Kaiser's doing. Negotiations with the
Arts Council already were under way, and it was well known that one
condition for larger grants was a reduction in ticket prices. Yet
with his reputation of having helped restore financial health to
the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and the American Ballet
Theater, Kaiser has been welcomed here like a doctor arriving at
the scene of a crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does help to come from the outside,'' Kaiser, a 45-year-old
New Yorker, said in an interview in his office opposite the opera
house, ``because my experience of troubled organizations is that
when you are in the midst of all the problems, everyone is focused
on the past. Who caused the problem? How did we get into this mess?
They point fingers at each other, the staff blames the board, the
board blames the staff. And no one is saying, `where do we go from
here?'''
</P>
<P>
   In an American ``can do'' way that always dazzles Britons, he
has promised that an array of outstanding problems will soon be
resolved. Perhaps to the dismay of some here, he does not even
consider Covent Garden's crisis to be that special.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of hurt here, and that's another thing in
common with troubled organizations,'' he explained. ``People were
feeling unloved, that they were not being treated properly, because
when an organization is in trouble, typically the leadership begins
cutting back on marketing and the creating of arts. The public and
donors lose interest. You get less revenue, and you cut more
marketing and arts, and you end up in deep trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Kaiser's first aid program has involved making the
artists _ the orchestra, the chorus and the dancers _ feel wanted
again. He likes to remind them that he first studied to be an opera
singer, that his grandfather played in the New York Philharmonic,
and that he spent much of the 1990s with ballet companies. He is
intent on attending as many of their performances as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want them to understand that I am in this field because I
love the arts and I love artists, and I am there to support them.''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser is also trying to restore a more traditional relationship
between the senior staff and the house's seven-member board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically, in times of trouble, the board gets involved in
day-to-day activities, and this is what happened here,'' he noted.
``Now we have to train them, to get them to recognize that if this
place is going to be successful, it has to be run by the staff and
not by the board.''
</P>
<P>
   His only disappointment so far is that the American director
Francesca Zambello turned down an invitation to become the artistic
director of the Royal Opera.
</P>
<P>
   Last year after Kaiser's own appointment, Sarah Billinghurst,
head of artistic planning at the Metropolitan Opera in New York,
also refused the job, reportedly because she was rebuffed in her
request to be named head of all Covent Garden. Now the search for a
new artistic director for opera has resumed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The structure we anticipate is three people reporting to the
board, myself, Sir Anthony Dowell as artistic director of the Royal
Ballet and the artistic director of the Royal Opera,'' Kaiser
explained. ``I have a great deal of experience of working with
partners, and it works fine because I believe art comes first. If I
believed the balance sheet was the most important thing, then I
think we'd be in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Work continues on Covent Garden's expansion, which includes
enlarging the backstage, raising the fly tower and adding two large
annexes comprising offices, rehearsal rooms and the Studio Theater
as well as a reception area in the so-called Floral Hall. But the
Royal Opera House has not yet covered the project's $360 million
final cost.
</P>
<P>
   It has received a $125 million grant from National Lottery
profits, it has borrowed some $70 million against future rentals of
street-level shop space in its new annexes, and it has raised $130
million in private donations. But it needs a further $32 million.
The house's anticipated deficit in March 2000 is another $32
million.
</P>
<P>
   But Kaiser likes fund raising, which ``is unusual for an arts
executive in Britain,'' he said. He seems quite unfazed by the
warnings that prosperous Britons have no tradition of donating
money to the arts and the tax system does not encourage
contributions. ``There is money out there and people are willing to
give it,'' he said. ``You just have to have an exciting project to
attract.''

 LONDON: to attract.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fund-raising experience certainly helps. For example, each of
the 16,000 Friends of Covent Garden pay just $70 a year for the
privilege of attending lectures and some rehearsals.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser said he planned to introduce ``a ladder of giving,''
common in the United States, to squeeze more money out of the
friends. With private or corporate donors, he said, there is
usually a need that can be satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some want corporate entertaining opportunities,'' he said.
``They may want a product or service to be associated with
something of high quality. They may want marketing visibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser has found an unusual way of tapping corporate funds by
charging higher ticket prices for performances Monday through
Thursday, ``when our corporate donors do their entertaining.''
</P>
<P>
   On Fridays and Saturday top ticket prices will fall to $136 from
$160 for opera and to $80 from $96 for ballet. Half the 2,300 seats
in the house for every performance will also be available at less
than half the top price.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser is planning a full 2001-02 season, but until then,
instead of working from September through July, the Royal Opera
House will suspend its productions at the end of May and rent the
theater to touring companies (like the Kirov Opera and Ballet in
the summer of 2000).
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the challenge is there, spelled out in a newspaper
headline on his first day at work, ``Chaos Reigns as Kaiser Enters
Opera House.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was my welcome,'' he said. &QL;

 LONDON: to attract.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fund-raising experience certainly helps. For example, each of
the 16,000 Friends of Covent Garden pay just $70 a year for the
privilege of attending lectures and some rehearsals.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser said he planned to introduce ``a ladder of giving,''
common in the United States, to squeeze more money out of the
friends. With private or corporate donors, he said, there is
usually a need that can be satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some want corporate entertaining opportunities,'' he said.
``They may want a product or service to be associated with
something of high quality. They may want marketing visibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser has found an unusual way of tapping corporate funds by
charging higher ticket prices for performances Monday through
Thursday, ``when our corporate donors do their entertaining.''
</P>
<P>
   On Fridays and Saturday top ticket prices will fall to $136 from
$160 for opera and to $80 from $96 for ballet. Half the 2,300 seats
in the house for every performance will also be available at less
than half the top price.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser is planning a full 2001-02 season, but until then,
instead of working from September through July, the Royal Opera
House will suspend its productions at the end of May and rent the
theater to touring companies (like the Kirov Opera and Ballet in
the summer of 2000).
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the challenge is there, spelled out in a newspaper
headline on his first day at work, ``Chaos Reigns as Kaiser Enters
Opera House.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was my welcome,'' he said. &QL;

HOWARD STERN HAS A TV HIT BUT NOT A KNOCKOUT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Calif., Pa., Mo., Texas, Ariz., Wis., Utah)  ( nk ) 
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Howard Stern, the disk jockey synonymous with
the term ``shock jock,'' announced he was turning his radio show to
late-night television on Saturday nights, he bragged he would turn
NBC's ``Saturday Night Live'' into ``Saturday Night Dead.''
</P>
<P>
   With the season half over, how is he doing?
</P>
<P>
   Stern's show has barely dented ``Saturday Night Live,'' with one
exception: Among men ages 18 to 34, an audience most television
stations find difficult to attract, ``The Howard Stern Radio Show''
is a hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among men 18 to 34, we're beating `Saturday Night Live,' and
in our first season,'' Stern crowed during a speech-and-standup
routine he performed at the television industry's annual
programming convention last month.
</P>
<P>
   Like much of what Stern says, that was exaggerated. His show is
beating ``Saturday Night Live'' among men 18 to 34 in seven or
eight big-city markets, including New York, Chicago and
Philadelphia, and a handful of smaller cities. But its national
rating among that age group trails the NBC show.
</P>
<P>
   In total viewers, ``Saturday Night Live'' has an average of 8.2
million to Stern's 2 million (``Mad TV,'' Fox's Saturday late-night
comedy show, attracts about 4.9 million), although Stern's show is
available on only 65 stations, reaching about 61 percent of
American homes, while ``Saturday Night Live'' is on 219 stations,
reaching almost all of the nation's homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He set up a bad comparison for himself when he said he was
going to get `Saturday Night Live,''' said Marc Berman, an analyst
for Seltel Inc., who advises local stations about programs to buy.
``He's comparing apples to oranges, because `Saturday Night Live'
is in 99 percent of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Berman added: ``But if you look at individual markets,
particularly urban markets, he has brought a lot of new viewers to
the time period. He's tripling the number of men, and he's bringing
in more women, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Berman said it was not a case of taking viewers away from
``Saturday Night Live'' or Fox's ``Mad TV,'' either, but of
attracting new viewers, who otherwise might not have been watching
television at all at that time.
</P>
<P>
   For Eyemark Entertainment, the CBS-owned syndication company
that distributes Stern's show, and for the 12 CBS-owned stations
that show it, ``The Howard Stern Radio Show'' is considered
successful because it has substantially improved the rating that
most stations used to get in that time period (usually with
reruns).
</P>
<P>
   That means it has increased the money stations make in that time
period, although not necessarily substantially. Many advertisers
still shy away from the Stern show because of its lewd and, by most
standards, tasteless shenanigans.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when the general manager of WBDC-TV in Washington, said
earlier this month that he would not renew the Stern show for next
season, his reason was that although ratings had improved, the
objections from local advertisers were such that the station was
not earning enough extra money to make it worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   Since its Aug. 28 debut, a dozen stations that bought the show
from Eyemark have dropped it, including stations in St. Louis,
Phoenix and San Diego; the Houston station carrying it also has
said it will not renew.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, 12 of the 14 CBS- owned-and-operated stations
agreed to carry ``The Howard Stern Radio Show''in the 11:30 p.m.
time period, opposite ``Saturday Night Live'' (the exceptions are
in Green Bay and Salt Lake City), and those stations have all seen
their ratings for the time slot jump, especially among men. The
show ranks either first or second among young men in its time slot
in those 12 markets, and in many of them, CBS had ranked as low as
sixth or seventh last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``To take off nationally, they need to get the show cleared in
more than 65 percent of the country,'' Berman said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That is why Stern went to speak at Natpe, the convention of the
National Association of Television Programming Executives, last
month. Stern's speech emphasized that his brand of blunt sexual
humor has often been imitated, even by shows in other genres, and
has changed the standards for what's acceptable on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time Ricki Lake uses the word `penis' on the air, she
has me to thank,'' he said. And, citing a renowned remark by Newton
N. Minow when he was the chairman of the Federal Communications
Commission, Stern said: ``Newton Minow said it best: `Television is
a vast wasteland.' And I'm here to reassure you that I'll do all I
can to make sure it stays that way.''
</P>
<P>
   After his speech, Stern held court at Eyemark's convention booth
to chat with potential customers. No new stations signed up, but
his effort might help persuade some to buy the show for next
season.

`EX-FRIENDS': LEAVING THE FLOCK AND BEING EXCOMMUNICATED 
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: Publication Notes at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 BY CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The title of Norman Podhoretz's fascinating new memoir,
``Ex-Friends,'' refers to two overlapping groups of people. One
comprises those individuals mentioned in his subtitle, ``Falling
Out With Allen Ginsberg, Lionel and Diana Trilling, Lillian
Hellman, Hannah Arendt and Norman Mailer.''
</P>
<P>
   Podhoretz devotes most of his book to this first group. The
retired editor in chief of Commentary magazine and the author of
embattled books like ``Making It,'' ``Breaking Ranks,'' ``Why We
Were in Vietnam'' and ``The Bloody Crossroads,'' among others, he
sums up his disaffection as follows: ``Having been a liberal of the
old style myself'' as a young man storming the New York
intellectual scene in the late 1950s and early '60s, he
``participated in the conversion to radicalism'' that those times
inspired in so many.
</P>
<P>
   He continues: ``It was when I lost faith in the teachings and
practices of the radical (or, to use the confusing new designation,
`liberal') `church' that I also lost all the friends I had made as
a devoted communicant. They now looked upon me as a dangerous
heretic, which I certainly was from their point of view, and I
considered them a threat to the well-being of everything I now held
dear, which they certainly were _ and still are.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is the individual stories of these falling-outs that make
``Ex-Friends'' such a textured intellectual history and lend the
book its unusual spiciness. It is here that Podhoretz tells how he
contended for some 40 years with Ginsberg, the poet, (never in fact
a friend) over the ``glorification'' in his writings of insanity,
drugs and promiscuity; how his relations with the Trillings (more
mentors than friends) grew rocky over his political veering, too
far for their tastes to both the left and the right and over his
book on the ``dirty little secret'' of ambition, ``Making It.''
</P>
<P>
   Here he recounts how he fell for the flattery and fun of being
friends with Hellman, despite his better instincts, until what he
defines as her persisting Stalinism and his impatience with the
anti-Americanism of the New Left drove wedges between them; how his
admiration for Arendt's brilliance of mind (her ``Origins of
Totalitarianism'' reinforced his anti-Communism) became tainted by
what he saw as a perverse interpretation of the Holocaust in her
book ``Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil,''
and how his deep and longtime friendship with Mailer eventually
collapsed under the strain of political differences.
</P>
<P>
   It is here, too, that you quarrel with Podhoretz. You question
his vehemence in rejecting poems and novels with cultural and
political implications that don't happen to square with his views.
Can't one distinguish between the feelings expressed by a poem like
Ginsberg's ``Howl'' and its message as a guide to behavior?
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't it valuable for those feelings to be vented at the time
``Howl'' appeared? Would the culture have been better off without
the poem? By the same token, was the Air Force Academy in Colorado
wrong to honor Joseph Heller's ``Catch-22'' despite what Podhoretz
refers to as ``Heller's justification of draft evasion and even
desertion as morally superior to military service''?
</P>
<P>
   Besides, why did he find behavior in the name of ``instinct''
reprehensible when endorsed by Ginsberg at almost precisely the
same time as he was attracted to Mailer for offering him glimpses
of a way to break through what he calls ``the constrictions and the
limits defined by traditional moral and cultural categories?''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, he adds that what inspired him about Mailer ``could
only be done by working one's way through those categories: Merely
dismissing them contemptuously, as the intellectually philistine
Beat writers were doing, could lead into nothing but sterility and
nihilism.''
</P>
<P>
   But as he describes his escapades with Mailer, a fair amount of
contemptuous dismissal of tradition was occurring, albeit with a
good deal of hesitation on Podhoretz's part. Still, you get the
sense that more was going on with this choice than the
super-rational Podhoretz has entirely accounted for.
</P>
<P>
   Finally you wonder why his friendships had to be so dependent on
like-mindedness. Certainly he shows himself capable of the little
hypocrisies that buttress ordinary friendships, if his lying to
Hellman about what he really thought of her writing is evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Was there really not enough residual affection beyond the realm
of ideas to allow him to attend Diana Trilling's funeral without
feeling ``hypocritical,'' or did he simply not care for her all
that much in the first place?
</P>
<P>
   If ideological congruity matters so much in friendship, how does
someone like William F. Buckley Jr. manage to maintain warm
relations with people all across the political spectrum?
</P>
<P>
   Podhoretz answers some of these questions when he discusses in
his foreword and afterword the second group of ex-friends referred
to by his title, the group of New York intellectuals he calls the
Family. (The six people in the first group were all relatives, so
to speak, either close or distant.)
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Family were not necessarily friends. As Podhoretz
writes, ``It was by virtue of sharing a common culture, and not
because they were fond of one another, that the writers and
intellectuals whose work once appeared mainly in Partisan Review
and Commentary became a Family.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of various cultural developments, the Family was
beginning to break up by the time Podhoretz became a member. ``In
fact,'' he writes, these developments were ``steadily eroding the
foundations of the Family's communal interdependence by the time
the political wars of the 1960s erupted.''
</P>
<P>
   He concludes, ``Those wars accelerated the process of cultural
disintegration already going on within the Family and finally led
to its complete dissolution.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Family formed a community whose loss Podhoretz sorely
regrets. It is the memory not of its warmth, but of its hostilities
_ both in the Family as a whole and with those members he has
singled out _ that has ignited this deliciously gossipy and
scintillating recollection of our times.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Exceptionally dry air will cover much of the nation on Monday,
but a series of potent disturbances poised over the central and
eastern Pacific will move quickly east, causing a change to
unsettled conditions in many areas during the middle and latter
part of the week.
</P>
<P>
   After a cold dawn over the East Coast states, temperatures will
rebound above seasonal levels as high pressure moves off the
Atlantic seaboard. Sunshine will be abundant in most areas,
although a few high clouds will dim the sun at times in parts of
the interior Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south along the southern flank of the high, onshore
breezes will bring patchy clouds and isolated showers near the east
coast of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Breezes from the southwest will transport unseasonably mild air
from the southern and central Plains to the Mississippi and Ohio
valleys. Sunshine will mix with patchy clouds during the day as
moisture is gradually drawn north from the Gulf of Mexico. By
Monday night, showers will develop from northeast Texas to the
central Mississippi Valley as a cold front approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Farther north, clouds and patchy light snow will occur near low
pressure over the northern part of the Dakotas and Minnesota. The
snow will spread toward the northern Great Lakes on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, high pressure will keep most of the interior cold
and dry, despite some snow showers along west-facing mountain
slopes and near a jet-stream disturbance over northern New Mexico.
Meanwhile, rain will develop near the northwest coast and will
become heavier Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Money in the Bank
</P>
<P>
   Through Sunday, precipitation totals in parts of California were
averaging only 50 percent to 85 percent of the normal amount
expected at this point in the rainy season. While such rainfall
deficits may cause some concern, there is still money in the bank.
Most of California relies on mountain snow melt to replenish
northern reservoirs that supply water during the long, dry summer.
Here, recurrent moist winds have produced ample snow in the
mountains this winter. Some areas in the northern Sierra have had
several feet of new snow this month, bringing seasonal snowfall
totals near or above normal.

POLAND SEEKS ROLE IN SHAPING FUND FOR NAZI VICTIMS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Israel)   (jw) 
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Poland is seeking a central role in shaping a financial fund
being set up by German companies to compensate forced laborers
during World War II and other victims of Nazi horrors.
</P>
<P>
   Wieslaw Walendziak, the chief of staff to Polish Prime Minister
Jerzy Buzek, said in a telephone interview Friday that some 2
million Poles were deported to Germany after the Nazis invaded in
1939 and subsequently worked under prison-like conditions in German
companies or on farms. He estimated that some 520,000 of them live
in Poland today.
</P>
<P>
   Since World War II ended, the German government has paid out 140
billion marks, or about $80 billion at current exchange rates, in
war reparations and aid, much of it to Jews who fled Germany or
suffered in concentration camps. But Walendziak said only 1 percent
of such funds have gone to former forced laborers living in Central
and Eastern Europe, which became part of the Soviet bloc after
1945.
</P>
<P>
   Walendziak flew to Washington for talks at the State Department
just days after a top aide to the German chancellor was in
Washington and confirmed the intention of Germany's government and
major corporations to compensate forced laborers and thus address a
wave of class action lawsuits over the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Any such scheme must recognize obligations to Poles and other
non-Jews, Walendziak said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These issues must be resolved once and for all so that they
bring the issue to a closure, not to another problem,'' Walendziak
said. ``We certainly expect the results to be meaningful
compensation to people who were victims of forced labor.''
</P>
<P>
   Walendziak spoke after a two-hour meeting Friday with Stuart
Eizenstat, the State Department's undersecretary for business and
economic affairs, who has been extremely active in
Holocaust-related issues.
</P>
<P>
   Days earlier, Bodo Hombach, top aide to German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder, was in Washington and said the German government
had agreed to establish a compensation fund financed by major
German manufacturers, banks and others intended to resolve
Holocaust-era claims against German industry.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, several class-action lawsuits have been
brought against dozens of German companies, including Volkswagen,
Siemens and Deutsche Bank. The lawsuits allege, among other things,
that the companies profited from the use of forced labor or assets
seized from Jews and other Nazi victims.
</P>
<P>
   Hombach did not discuss details of the plan, which is still
taking shape. But a translated copy of a discussion paper
circulated by German officials and obtained by The New York Times
states that the initiative is intended to respond ``to the moral
obligations'' of German companies and to create a basis for dealing
``with class actions in the U.S.A. and to scotch any plans for a
boycott.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the document, the German initiative foresees
devoting funds to compensation of Nazi victims, including forced
laborers, and to international ``remembrance'' programs involving
groups in Germany, the United States, Israel and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The compensation would give priority to those in need, the
document states. It says the money should go to victims of forced
labor deported by the Nazis from occupied countries and used in
German industry as ``concentration camp prisoners or under
prison-like conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The funds should provide them with a measure of moral redress
and material assistance,'' the proposal states.
</P>
<P>
   The term ``forced'' laborer typically applies to non-Jews
deported to Germany from Poland, Russia or other East European
countries. Concentration camp prisoners who were used by German
industry are generally referred to by historians as slave laborers.
</P>
<P>
   Forced laborers outnumbered slave laborers by about 10-to-1.
Many slave laborers, about half of whom were Jewish, starved or
perished otherwise during the war.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When announced by Hombach, the German initiative was greeted
warmly by leaders of the World Jewish Congress, a New York-based
group active in Holocaust compensation issues. But it may face
hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   Both German companies and government officials seek to avoid the
protracted battle that Swiss banks engaged in before resolving
claims that they profited from the assets of Jews and other
Holocaust victims. But the Germans also face demands from a broader
class of claimants like forced laborers, and from Holocaust
survivors or their heirs seeking payments from German banks and
European insurers.
</P>
<P>
   The Polish government, for one, has closely allied itself with
several of the class-action lawyers who were active in the Swiss
banks litigation. Walendziak says he foresees a role for those
lawyers in any negotiations, which the Germans hope will result in
all class action lawsuits' being dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is possible that this is going to be resolved through
political negotiations,'' he said. ``But I emphasize that this is
going to happen with the assistance of attorneys.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Hombach and Eizenstat assured him the Polish position would
be taken into account, Walendziak said.
</P>
<P>
   Eizenstat said in a telephone interview that the German
initiative would address both forced and slave labor, although
immediate emphasis was on slave laborers.
</P>
<P>
   Emphasizing the financial need of various victims may slow
distribution of any funds made available by the Germans.
</P>
<P>
   For several decades, one group associated with the World Jewish
Congress, the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany,
has negotiated reparation payments for Nazi survivors based on
income levels. The group, which has a proposed role in the new
initiative, has been criticized by some groups for taking years to
approve payments.

NBC DISCOVERS NEW STRATEGY IN `THE '60S' 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After selling tens of thousands of music CDs in
conjunction with its recent miniseries ``The '60s'' and ``The
Temptations,'' NBC executives believe they have found a new source
of revenue for the increasingly strained network television
business: direct-response sales of music through toll-free
telephone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   And to keep the flow of revenue going, the network's movie
department is now picking some projects specifically for their
potential to generate albums that NBC can sell to its viewers. NBC
executives acknowledge that some of their programming decisions are
being influenced by the potential for merchandising profits.
</P>
<P>
   This means that viewers will be hearing a lot of rock 'n' roll
music on NBC and not only because of the strong ratings that ``The
Temptations'' and ``The '60s'' scored on the network. Lindy
DeKoven, the executive vice president of movies and miniseries for
NBC, said the network believed it had found in music-oriented
movies ``a new economic model'' for the network television
business.
</P>
<P>
   Network television, facing higher program costs and diminishing
market share, finds itself more than ever in need of ways to raise
revenues beyond the single source of advertising.
</P>
<P>
   At least three more music-oriented miniseries are in various
stages of development at NBC, including a follow-up to ``The '60s''
called ``The '70s,'' a fictional history of rock 'n' roll, and an
account of the lives and times of the three brothers that made up
the group the Bee Gees.
</P>
<P>
   During its broadcast of ``The '60s'' last week, NBC made on-air
announcements of a special toll-free telephone number set up for
sales of a CD of music from the movie, along with a videocassette
of the movie itself.
</P>
<P>
   NBC had sold more than 35,000 units of the $29.95 package by the
end of last week. That did not include what NBC will take in from
retail sales. The CD reached the top sales spot on Amazon.com, and
moved up from number 87 to number 65 in the Billboard album charts
the week the movie was on the air.
</P>
<P>
   NBC hopes for more sales in the summer when the miniseries will
be televised again, this time carried by both NBC and the cable
music channel VH-1, part of the MTV Networks unit of Viacom Inc.,
in a deal that will be announced Monday. VH-1 has already run
promotions for the show on its channel and will run direct-response
commercials for the soundtrack and home video each time it carries
the movie in August.
</P>
<P>
   NBC first tried the direct marketing approach in a significant
way last April when the network sold more than 100,000
videocassettes of another miniseries, ``Merlin.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Don Ohlmeyer, the head of NBC's West Coast
division, said the network would commit itself more and more to the
``direct transaction business'' as a way to ``devise other revenue
streams'' for the network. He predicted that NBC would find other
products to sell besides videos of shows. Music is the product the
network has identified as having the most potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very interesting way to sell records,'' said Jerry
Petry, the executive vice president of NBC Enterprises. ``We always
knew the reach of the network was very strong.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC is now looking at the potential for ancillary profits from
the very start of its production planning, Ms. DeKoven said. ``Do
we think now about ancillary opportunities before we start up a
project?'' she said. ``The answer is yes.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she said, in initiating the idea that became ``The
'60s,'' ``we started out with a music supervisor picking out what
songs might be appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the ratings for the first part of the film arrived,
Ms. DeKoven gave the go-ahead for a follow-up miniseries, ``The
'70s,'' which is expected to be on next season.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And some preliminary discussions have been held about further
follow-ups to ``The '60s'' that could tell the story of ``The
'80s'' and ``The '90s.'' Ms. DeKoven said, ``We picked up `The
'70s' because it seemed like the period lends itself to music, and
so the ancillary opportunities would be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Petry said NBC had also experimented with direct marketing of
CDs on other NBC shows. Last fall, he said, the singer Jewel
appeared on NBC's ``Tonight'' show just as she was releasing her
new album.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a direct-response spot on the `Tonight' show,'' he
said. ``It drove their sales numbers up. We weren't in that for the
money. We were in it to say: Here's what we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Petry acknowledged that the total revenue from direct sales of
the CDs and video from ``The '60s'' might not be impressive by the
standards of the television advertising business, which is measured
in billions.
</P>
<P>
   Even kicking in extra profits from shipping and handling costs,
and sales of another CD being offered with the deal, a collection
of Marvin Gaye's greatest hits, the direct-response revenue from
``The '60s'' might only reach $2 million to $3 million, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The '60s'' was a new phase in NBC's effort to build additional
revenue, Ms. DeKoven said, because ``Merlin'' and ``The
Temptations'' were produced by outside studios.
</P>
<P>
   NBC produced ``The '60s'' itself and owns the film, so it does
not need to share profits from sales of the CD with a studio. But
Petry had to make a deal with a record label for the right to use
the music. He said he approached all the large labels, some of
which were reluctant to collaborate with a television movie.
</P>
<P>
   Executives from Mercury Records were most enthusiastic about the
project, Petry said, and agreed to work with NBC to produce the CD
for an equal share of its profits. Mercury was able to provide some
of the music itself but had to make deals with other labels for
songs the filmmakers wanted to use. The biggest deal came with Sony
for the use of Bob Dylan's ``Chimes of Freedom,'' which he
rerecorded for the film.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Petry said, with the sales of the CD from ``The '60s'' to
show to other record labels, ``I imagine it's going to be much
easier to convince them'' to sign on to NBC's future music-oriented
movies, he said.

TEEN-AGE IDOLS COME ALIVE   AT A TEMPLE FOR DEADHEADS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By ANN POWERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The truth behind a pop conspiracy was unveiled late
Saturday night at Wetlands during the second night of Bob Weir and
Rob Wasserman's three-night stand. After midnight Weir, the
Grateful Dead guitarist, and his stand-up bass-playing collaborator
stepped back onstage to continue their jam session, and Weir
announced that he had some friends to welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Out bounded three rosy teen-agers in blond ponytails who sped
into a spirited set of blues oldies and Dead tunes, led by an
enlivened Weir. Yes, it was Hanson, the fraternal team behind
``MMMBop,'' revealing itself to be not a teeny-bop act after all,
but a hippie reconnaissance unit spreading the Dead's legacy to a
new generation.
</P>
<P>
   All right, the conspiracy bit is a bit far-fetched, but Isaac,
Zachary and Taylor Hanson were obviously overjoyed to be playing
music more funky and expansive than what their usual fan base of
10-year-olds demands. Weir also gained a spark from the exchange,
letting loose his most intense guitar leads of the night and even
attempting a Little Richard-style scream on the final song,
``Another Saturday Night.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he graciously let Isaac take a couple of competent
guitar solos, his attention gravitated toward the keyboard-thumping
Taylor, the most precocious brother and the only one wearing
tie-dye.
</P>
<P>
   The audience resisted hysterics at the sight of the teen idols;
many fans didn't even seem to know who they were at first, and
they'd already spent their idol-worshiping energy on Weir himself.
</P>
<P>
   This appearance, his first New York club date in a
quarter-century, celebrated Wetlands' 10th anniversary. Since the
club was founded as a gathering place for those mellow obsessives
known as Deadheads, Weir's presence has had the effect of a holy
visitation. Luckily, because the trio he has formed with Wasserman
and the drummer Jay Lane is so supple and intuitively connected, it
also made for very fine music.
</P>
<P>
   The set included several Bob Dylan compositions, a couple of
excellent oldies (including a genteel take on ``Twilight Time,''
which suited Weir's patrician singing style), and the requisite
Dead sing-alongs. Wasserman and Lane both took song-length solos,
with Wasserman showing his improvisatory chops by responding to an
audience request by playing an emphatic version of ``I Can't Get No
Satisfaction.'' Mostly the three men intertwined their efforts in
the casually dynamic style for which the Dead was known.
</P>
<P>
   Another surprise came when Hun-Huur-Tu, the throat-singing group
from Tuva, stopped by after its Town Hall performance.
</P>
<P>
   These Siberian artists, known for producing multi-note harmonics
by manipulating their vocal cords, performed a few songs with
commentary provided by a translator.
</P>
<P>
   One member played electric guitar on the final number. The music
did not seem to betray any link to either Hanson or the Grateful
Dead, but who knows? Perhaps this conspiracy reaches farther than
anyone suspects.

   GLOBAL-ECON-I (Undated) _ It is still not clear that the
financial upheavals, which began in Thailand in July 1997, will
ever damage the United States. But the collapse of Brazil's
currency in January and the jolt that it brought to markets
worldwide underscored the continuing risks of ``the most serious
financial crisis in a half a century,'' as Clinton called it in his
State of the Union address. This series of four articles is a
narrative of the worldwide financial crisis that over the last 20
months has toppled some governments and hobbled others. The crisis
illustrates how globalization increasingly stitches lives all over
the world into a single economic quilt. In the new economic
landscape that has emerged in recent years, the pool of
international investments has grown to dwarf the sums that
governments can muster, and money zips around the globe far faster
than ever before. The result is a world more prosperous; but also,
perhaps, a bit more wobbly. By Nicholas D. Kristof with Edward
Wyatt. 6,500 words, pix, graphics.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps the most far-reaching battle in telecommunications these
days is not being waged in board rooms or stock markets. It is
being fought in places like the Mines Beach Resort and Spa outside
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   There, in a conference room not far from the ocean,
representatives of 34 of the world's largest communications
companies joined official delegates from 14 nations on Feb. 6 to
try to forge a consensus on the next generation of wireless phones.
</P>
<P>
   That they failed was hardly surprising. For the last 18 months,
the biggest players in the wireless business, both carriers and
equipment makers, have been embroiled in what an AT&AMP;T spokesman
describes as a financial, regulatory and political holy war for
control of the wireless future.
</P>
<P>
   In six weeks, the International Telecommunication Union, a
United Nations agency that set up the meeting in Malaysia, is
scheduled to start approving international standards for wireless
technologies for the next decade. But that process is being
threatened by a general reluctance to compromise on arcane
technical standards and in particular by intransigence on the part
of Ericsson of Sweden and Qualcomm Inc., of San Diego, two big
communications manufacturers that have feuded for years.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are immense for both consumers and the companies.
Over the next few years, most of the world's wireless carriers
intend to introduce services that could prove technically
momentous. With an emphasis on bringing high-speed data services to
customers wherever they are, proponents of so-called
third-generation wireless technology predict that the next wave of
mobile phones will incorporate World Wide Web browsing and video
conferences. Billions of dollars in revenue could await the
companies that manufacture and sell the equipment that will make
this happen.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a wave of consolidations is creating bigger
and broader wireless carriers. Last month, for instance, the
Vodafone Group, Britain's biggest wireless company, agreed to
acquire Airtouch Communications of San Francisco, another huge
wireless provider, for $60 billion.
</P>
<P>
   And as carriers extend their coverage, there is rising potential
for callers to be able to use one phone, with one number, almost
anywhere and at rates that are widely affordable. But to make that
happen, the carriers, manufacturers and, to some extent,
governments would have to agree on a single standard. Many industry
insiders now think that will not happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of one standard or a universal standard sounds
good,'' said Jim Brewington, who runs the wireless business for
Lucent Technologies, North America's largest communications
equipment maker and a relatively neutral party in the dispute. ``We
would like to see it happen. I frankly don't think it's going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Fabio Leite, a wireless counselor for the telecommunications
union in Geneva, said, ``We have a lot of reasons to be
pessimistic.'' And even the adversaries concede that the fight,
though couched in highly technical language, is really a political
struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're asking me is it a political issue or a technical
issue, I'll say it's a political issue,'' said Keith Paglusch, a
senior vice president of Sprint PCS, a big U.S. wireless carrier
that essentially belongs to the Qualcomm camp. ``It really is a
business/political issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The roots of the row over third-generation wireless technology
were put down in the early 90s, when it became clear that the first
generation of wireless phones, analog cellular, was going to be
replaced by a second digital generation known as PCS _ personal
communications services.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Qualcomm was basically alone in advocating a
wireless approach known as CDMA, for code division multiple access.
This works somewhat like the Internet in that it breaks messages
into small bits, which are then scattered throughout the wireless
telephone spectrum and reassembled at their destination. The idea
that CDMA, which was originally developed for military purposes,
could be adapted to civilian use was heresy to many wireless
engineers and their companies.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most vociferous in its criticism was Ericsson, which
had built a big second-generation wireless business on a competing
technology called time division multiple access. That technology
uses relatively narrow batches of wireless frequencies, which it
then breaks up many times a second to convey many messages.
</P>
<P>
   It is in a lot of ways similar to a third technology in the
wireless alphabet soup: GSM, or global system for mobile
communication, which is the dominant second-generation standard in
Europe and many other areas. It is largely associated with Ericsson
but is also supported by Nokia of Finland, Siemens of Germany and
others.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the engineers' early doubts, CDMA, which was chosen by
Sprint PCS and a few other carriers, turned out to work just fine _
and perhaps better than fine. So Qualcomm was upset when in October
1996, just as CDMA was emerging, Ericsson sued Qualcomm, charging
that Ericsson held patents covering parts of Qualcomm's systems.
The trial is scheduled to begin in April in a Federal court in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Not much later, development began on the wireless third
generation, and both Qualcomm and Ericsson chose to use CDMA
technology for transmitting digital data at high speed.
</P>
<P>
   But in developing third-generation systems, Qualcomm and
Ericsson seemed to have different agendas. Qualcomm wanted the new
systems to be compatible with existing CDMA systems, so that
carriers would not have to scrap their investments and Qualcomm
could continue to sell second-generation CDMA with the promise that
it could be upgraded.
</P>
<P>
   Ericsson, with no installed base of CDMA systems, did not appear
as concerned with the compatibility issue. So with European
partners, it developed a technology that is not compatible with
existing CDMA services. It said it simply wanted the most robust,
advanced system possible. But some U.S. executives and officials
smelled a plot after the European Union adopted a directive in
December that appeared to force European carriers to use Ericsson's
third-generation technology.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright; Secretary of Commerce
William Daley; U.S. trade representative Charlene Barshefsky, and
William E. Kennard, chairman of the Federal Communications
Commission, sent a letter to the Europeans expressing concern over
the policy.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the European commissioner for telecommunications,
Martin Bangemann, appeared to mollify American policy makers
somewhat by saying that competing standards would not be barred
from Europe. But suspicion remains.
</P>
<P>
   An American official, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
said, ``It appears to some of us that our friends in Europe want to
duplicate the conditions that allowed GSM to become the predominant
global second-generation technology: Get it to market first,
mandate it as a pan-European standard and make sure it's not
backwards-compatible with existing wireless networks in North
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Ericsson and Qualcomm have now each claimed patent rights over
each other's third-generation proposals, and the International
Telecommunication Union says it cannot certify a standard until the
property rights are settled. Qualcomm wants Ericsson to converge
its standard with Qualcomm's in a way that grants existing CDMA
operators thorough compatibility. Ericsson has so far refused,
saying such convergence would yield a technically inferior
standard.
</P>
<P>
   The end game may be a proliferation of multiple standards. For
consumers, that could mean abandoning hope for a seamless global
wireless network. Or it could mean higher prices if carriers and
equipment makers have to offer many technologies to insure seamless
global wireless systems.

 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was an important test of one facet of Internet commerce:
Would readers pay an annual subscription rate of $19.95 for the
privilege of reading a magazine on line?
</P>
<P>
   If the tale of Slate magazine, which is owned by Microsoft, is
any indication, the answer is no. Ten months after deciding to
charge readers $19.95 a year, the publisher of the online magazine
announced in an e-mail notice to subscribers that, as of last
Friday, it would now be available free on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kinsley, Slate's editor, said that the decision was not
a setback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, you don't like to reverse course,'' he said. ``You
try one thing, you try another. It's a stage in the learning
process.''
</P>
<P>
   In the e-mail to subscribers, Scott Moore _ who was named
publisher of the online magazine last Monday _ wrote that there
were two reasons for the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, the advertising market on the Web has continued to
expand at a remarkable pace, '' he wrote. ``It roughly doubled in
1998 to about $1.8 million, is predicted to grow to about $3
billion in 1999, and should continue a healthy 50 percent to 60
percent annual growth rate for the next several years.''
</P>
<P>
   He explained that ``the biggest problem with remaining paid was
that doing so would restrict our advertising potential.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're confident,'' he wrote. ``that by making Slate.com free
our audience will grow substantially and this will make us more
attractive to advertisers.''
</P>
<P>
   The second problem, Moore wrote, was that, on the Web, ``paid
subscriptions for content (other than smut and investments) simply
have not grown as expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new arrangement, readers who pay $19.95 a year will
get e-mail deliveries and print-out editions, and have access to
the archives and general bulletin board of Slate, services that
will not be provided free.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bass, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc., said that the
issue was one of supply and demand. `` Last year, I said this was
the dumbest thing I had ever heard,'' he said. ``There is so much
free content on the Web that if you try and charge for it people
won't go to you. There is too much substitutable content.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to the fact that readers can look at Salon magazine,
a Slate competitor, which is free. ``It's like if Ford came out
with a Taurus that cost $50,000. If I can get a Camry for $25,000,
why would I pay $50,000 for a Taurus?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Bass added that only two areas on the Internet can charge for
their services: financial and pornography sites. He said that
financial sites like thestreet.com and The Wall Street Journal's
Web site are popular because they offer specific advice that few
other sites offer, and the subscription prices can be written off
as business expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only wildly successful sites that charge have been adult
entertainment,'' he said. ``And people tend not to act economically
rationally around adult entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Keane, a senior analyst at Jupiter Communications, an
online market research firm, pointed out that there is also a
psychological hurdle for consumers to overcome in paying for
content on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``People see their personal computers as a utility device, and
they're going to pay for information that leads them toward a task,
or that helps them with a purchasing decision,'' he said. ``So
consumers don't have a natural proclivity to pay for content on
line.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he added that the Internet is a maturing market.
``After all,'' he said, referring to cable TV, ``if somebody had
told you in 1975 that you would be paying $40 a month for your
television, would you have believed it?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In an editor's letter posted on Friday, Kinsley answered what he
expected would be readers' questions about the decision. ``It's
painful,'' he wrote, ``to think of turning away so many Slate
readers from so much of our content _ not to mention the potential
readers who don't come in the first place. The spreadsheet wizards
figure that ad revenue from the increased traffic will more than
compensate for the lost subscriptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore said that the paying subscribers number in ``the high
twenty thousands'' and that the magazine was visited by 300,000 to
400,000 news users each month. Moore would not disclose Slate's ad
revenue, which is charted by an internal group, MSN Advertising
Sales.
</P>
<P>
   Slate was started in June 1996 and, after some false starts,
began charging last March. It has remained something of a sideshow
in Microsoft's Internet strategy, which in earlier stages
emphasized entertainment programming or local information but is
now focused on building traffic to a home page, MSN.com, that
directs users to both content and electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   On its Web site Friday, Salon, which is published by Salon
Internet Inc., crowed over the news, with a commentary headlined
sardonically ``Slate rejoins the Web.'' Later, in an interview,
David Talbot, the editor and chief executive of Salon, said that
Slate's decision to charge readers ``was a case of Microsoft's
hubris'' and ``prevented other sites from linking to it, further
restricting circulation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you charge, it prevents other sites from linking to you,
which is how the Web grows, when you become integrated to other Web
sites through links,'' he said. ``When you hit a gate as a reader
saying you have to pay, Web sites stop linking to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Marisa Bowe, the editor of the online magazine Word, which is
owned by the Zapata Corp., said that she was not surprised at
Slate's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, no one has really been willing to pay to read anything
on the Web,'' she said. ``It's a little heartbreaking for me to
say, but the Web magazines are just not as important, yet, as the
print magazines.''
</P>
<P>
   Kinsley said, ``I think if she's going to be depressed about
that, she's going to be depressed for a while.''

`MONICA'S STORY' UNFOLDS IN FLATIRON BUILDING
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the landmark Flatiron building, which houses St.
Martin's Press, elevators move with all desultory speed so there
was plenty of time last week for the various occupants to discuss
sightings of the fabled ``she.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is she still there?'' one employee asked another on the
downward descent from the 16th floor to the lobby. No first or last
names needed. Everyone seemed to know that Monica Lewinsky and her
new literary confidante, Andrew Morton, were ensconced in an
office, plotting the delicate strategy for the promotion of the
tell-more title, ``Monica's Story.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Martin's, a division of Macmillan Publishers Ltd., is still
planning on a late February publication date for the 288-page
portrait of the former White House intern by Morton, if a
court-imposed order of silence on Ms. Lewinsky is lifted. (``We're
just taking it day to day,'' John Murphy, a St. Martin's spokesman,
said.) But the book is apparently so eagerly anticipated (or
reviled) that potential readers started posting early reviews and
lewd critiques on the online bookstore, Amazon.com, which
eventually removed them.
</P>
<P>
   St. Martin's, which is initially printing at least 400,000
copies, is casting the book as a tale of a ``generous-hearted, but
troubled young woman'' who was betrayed by her friend, Linda Tripp,
and thrust as a pawn into a power struggle between President
Clinton and the Office of the Independent Counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Left unsaid is that Ms. Lewinsky got her book deal while Ms.
Tripp was still searching for sympathy, public rehabilitation and,
perhaps, a curious publisher. Ms. Tripp professes that she has no
plans for a book, although she does not rule it out.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the top publishing houses that could offer a
generous advance are unlikely to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her chances are less than zero,'' said an executive at a top
New York publishing house, who insisted on anonymity. ``She is
truly seen as the true harridan of this whole ghastly experience, a
woman who engenders no sympathy from either side of the
controversy. The perception here is that she is such an
unsympathetic figure and so unlikable that there would be an unduly
small number of people interested in her book.''
</P>
<P>
   Publishing well may be the best revenge.

   FALWELL TAKES ON THE TELETUBBIES
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jerry Falwell provoked laughter last week when he
chastised ``Teletubbies,'' a popular public television program for
children under the age of 3, accusing one of the cuddly, cooing,
antenna-topped characters, the purple one named Tinky Winky, of
``modeling the gay lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenn Viselman, the man responsible for promoting the
British-made show in the United States, can laugh all the way to
the bank. An estimated $800 million worth of Teletubby products _
toys, videos, pajamas and the like _ were sold in 1998, with PBS
getting a cut, said Jim Silver, the publisher of The Toy Book, a
toy industry trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the show did not make its PBS debut until April, and
products did not go on sale until June, the best-selling item in
the preschool plush-toy category for 1998 was the Talking Teletubby
(when squeezed it says, ``Eh-oh,'' for hello, and ``Bye-bye'').
</P>
<P>
   The Falwell furor happened to erupt during the week-long annual
Toy Fair in New York, which ends Monday.
</P>
<P>
   At the fair, Viselman presented the newest Tubby plush toy, one
with a rudimentary Microsoft computer in its tummy.
</P>
<P>
   An article in the February edition of Falwell's publication,
National Liberty Journal, argues that Tinky Winky is meant to be
gay because he has a boy's voice yet carries a red purse, he is
purple (``the gay-pride color'') and his antenna is a triangle
(``the gay-pride symbol'').

   On the ``Today'' show on NBC last week, Falwell told Katie
Couric that to have ``little boys running around with purses and
acting effeminate and leaving the idea that the masculine male, the
feminine female is out and gay is OK'' is something ``which
Christians do not agree with.''
</P>
<P>
   Viselman, who was also on the program, countered: ``We're
talking about a show for 1- to 4-year-olds. If we had homosexuals
in it, they wouldn't even know it,'' adding quickly, ``but we
don't.''
</P>
<P>
   After a busy day at Toy Fair, Silver said last Friday that
Falwell had probably helped the Teletubbies' business.
</P>
<P>
   ``All he's done is make a mockery of himself, and if anything
put more attention on Teletubbies and increases sales,'' he said.

   MEDIA BUYERS WORRY ABOUT THE TIMING AT TALK
</P>
<P>
   The announcement last week that Talk magazine would arrive on
newsstands in August _ the offspring of Miramax Films, which is
owned by the Walt Disney Co., and Hearst Magazines _ caused a
flurry of discussion in several industries.
</P>
<P>
   In the world of advertising, media buyers said that they were
concerned with what they perceived to be the late start in selling
ad pages for Talk. Roberta Garfinkle, the director of print media
at McCann-Erickson, a unit of the Interpublic Group of Cos., said
she would have liked to have seen Talk sell its ad pages earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``With an August launch, I think March is a little bit on the
late side to start selling advertising,'' she said, referring to
need of media buyers to plan yearlong schedules. ``Is it going to
hurt them substantially? No. But I think that there may be some
instances where budgets have been committed and it's too late to
make changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Writers wondered about pay days. Hiring writers at Hearst may
not prove as easy as it was with Conde Nast, a company known for
being extremely generous with writers' salaries. Ms. Brown said
that she was negotiating to hire a dozen writers away from other
publications, but was not able to announce who she was hiring yet.
``Their bosses don't know,'' she said. But writers who have been
approached by Ms. Brown's magazine have said that they were
surprised that salaries were not as high as expected.
</P>
<P>
   And in Hollywood, there had been rumors that Michael D. Eisner,
the chairman of the Walt Disney Co., did not know about Miramax's
involvement with Ms. Brown until very late in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, however, Eisner said, ``I have been trying to make a
deal with Tina for several years.'' As to whether starting a
magazine was risky, he said, ``I measure high risk by talent, and
Tina Brown is so talented that it puts a conservative bent on the
risk.''
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with Ms. Black, Ms. Brown, Ron Galotti, the
publisher of Talk, and Harvey Weinstein, the co-chairman of Miramax
Films, Weinstein said that he was certain Ms. Brown and Galotti
would not be wasteful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been out to dinner 10 times with Ron, and he's never once
picked up the check,'' Weinstein said. ``He's frugal, I
guarantee.''

CARNIVAL IN BRAZIL: DON'T WORRY, KEEP DANCING
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Financial centers may be worrying that
Brazil's economy could be going down the tubes and taking the rest
of Latin America with it. But in Rio, that's no reason not to
dance.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilians are engaged in the last Carnival of the millennium,
undeterred so far by driving rain and floods over the last few
weeks, the arrest of the man in charge of the main Carnival parade
on charges of money laundering and an economic scene that already
bears perhaps a bit too much resemblance to the Big Top.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Carnival of the crisis is here,'' Eduardo Giannetti, a
columnist at the Folha de Sao Paulo, wrote. ``Half of me will grow
delirious, the other half will ponder.''
</P>
<P>
   For four days, beginning Sunday and ending on Ash Wednesday,
official Brazil rolls down its shutters. President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso went off to his vacation home after promising not
to spoil the fun by announcing any new policies.
</P>
<P>
   A team from the International Monetary Fund made sure to finish
combing through Brazil's finances and reworking terms for its
standby loan before Carnival began.
</P>
<P>
   And when buttoned-down Brazil pulls back, party Brazil takes
over. The streets fill up with dance bands and costumes, known in
Portuguese as ``fantasias,'' in which the boundaries of convention
vanish. In the seaside neighborhood of Ipanema, where an
out-of-reach 14-year-old once inspired the song that is the bossa
nova's anthem, the surest way to tell the men from the women is by
the feet: The women wear flats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody lets go, without judging anybody else,'' said Ilson
Pinheiro, 39, who was selling beer at a free seaside concert. Every
few steps, the peddler dropped his cooler and broke out dancing
with whoever was near, from a toddler to an older woman whose
husband looked on, amused. ``This is marvelous _ I wish it were
like this all year,'' Pinheiro said.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday and Monday nights, fourteen of Rio's first-ranked samba
schools bring in the dawn with parades highlighting places like
Natal in northeastern Brazil, musicians like Heitor Villa Lobos,
artists and political and historical figures. Here in Rio, the
festival also features a growing number of informal street parades
staged by neighborhood bands and private celebrations around the
city.
</P>
<P>
   On the street where Rio's top samba schools use warehouses to
build the scores of ``carros alegoricos,'' as the mobile,
multi-level stages that are used to present their performances are
called, it is easy enough to see why Carnival endures. A walk
through a vestibule into one of the buildings, heavily guarded to
prevent spying by the competition, opens a world of four-story
fantasies in styrofoam and full color.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crises come and go,'' said Joaosinho Trinta, the creative
director, of the Viradouro samba school, ``but Carnival stays,
because it's our soul.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Trinta, who is 65, likens the samba school's parade to a street
opera. The samba schools' stories are told in highly stylized
music, dance and more than a half-dozen mobile tableaux, usually
accompanied by 3,000 or more costumed revelers. The crowds react by
singing the schools' lyrics, which radio stations have been playing
since New Year.
</P>
<P>
   Trinta's show this year focuses on Anita Garibaldi, a Brazilian
who was the wife of Giuseppe Garibaldi, the hero of Italian
unification. Trinta used a reference to Anita Garibaldi's rumored
involvement with sorcery as a springboard to illustrate different
kinds of magic he associates with Brazil. In his first float,
witches turn into butterflies, while elements of another float
illustrate the magic of its African culture, and yet another, its
indigenous tribes.
</P>
<P>
   Down the street, Rosa Magalhaes the only woman who is director
of a major samba school's production, created visions of giant
tigers jumping out of a library to illustrate the life of the
17th-century Dutch naturalist Albert Eckout.
</P>
<P>
   In one room late last week, scores of women ran seams and fixed
trimmings on the last of the costumes, while in another part of the
warehouse youngsters pasted red and black feathers on giant birds.
``Fun?'' she asked. ``Carnival is exhausting.''
</P>
<P>
   Another part of Carnival unfolds on the streets. Carnival's
street parades have nothing to do with the processions that New
Yorkers line up along the curbs to see. Rio's are more like roving
parties with blaring music, trailing coolers of beer. Conga lines
of people inevitably snake along the sidelines, growing longer with
each block.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carnival,'' said Trina, ``is a feast produced by the Brazilian
soul.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's Carnival also honors Carmen Miranda, the Brazilian
who turned a fruit bowl into a wardrobe. The city threw a free
concert of her music Saturday night, which ended with the audience
of all ages, colors and sizes dancing and gleefully singing ``Mama,
Mama I Want.''
</P>
<P>
   One samba parade was dedicated to ``the Brazilian bombshell,''
as Hollywood dubbed Carmen Miranda, and so was the poshest ball in
town, at the Copacabana Palace.
</P>
<P>
   The falling currency has made travel here cheaper, bringing many
more Americans to Brazil. Some of them who ended up in black tie at
the Palace seemed taken aback at first by the fast shaking
bacchanal on the dance floor. A drag queen dressed as a wedding
cake, complete with table, danced alongside Carmen impersonators,
sailors who looked like Popeye and a man wearing nothing but a Road
Warrior headdress, a G-string and chains.
</P>
<P>
   At 3 a.m., the percussion section from the Salgueiro samba
school marched in, decked out in blue and gold satin and leading a
fresh infusion of costumed samba dancers from the slums of Rio.
Powerful nonstop drumming drove the inhibitions from all but the
most diehard of wallflowers.
</P>
<P>
   By dawn, more than a few bow ties had been loosened.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Prado, 29, who worked on the samba school's scenery,
said that while he worried about the economy, Rio would seem alien
and cold if it were not for Carnival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Carnival,'' he said, ``life would have no grace''

PATENTS COLUMN:   ATM'S LEAD TO OTHER INVENTIONS THAT REPLACE
CLERKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., S.C., N.J.) (rk)

<P>
   Before automated teller machines, transacting business at a bank
required a human teller working during business hours. The
automated machines have proved that it is faster and more efficient
for customers to serve themselves by punching buttons at a computer
terminal. Exploiting the computer kiosk idea, more inventors are
patenting similar ways to eliminate clerks from retail services.
Last week, several inventions won patents for replacing those
employees with do-it-yourself, while-you-wait computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Norris' idea displaces another staple of the banking
business, the loan officer. Applying for a loan might seem too
complicated for a kiosk, but Norris contends that all the necessary
steps can be processed while the customer waits. He has patented a
system for real-time loan approval that uses a computer terminal to
complete the application, underwrite the loan and transfer the
money being borrowed.
</P>
<P>
   Norris of Lexington, S.C., has designed a computer program that
requests loan application information, analyzes the request,
decides whether to approve the loan, authorizes electronic transfer
of the money to the applicant's account, and sets up a schedule of
automatic withdrawals from that account to repay the loan.
</P>
<P>
   The application information would come in part from the
applicant himself, but also from data bases that the computer could
tap, like credit reporting bureaus. The paperwork for the loan is
transmitted to the computer terminal, where the customer's copy can
be printed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a preferred embodiment, the applicant accesses the computer
from a kiosk where the complete transaction can take place as the
applicant waits,'' Norris wrote in his patent. He was awarded
patent 5,870,721.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Lawlor and Timothy Carmody received a patent for a
system that enables people to pay bills from portable computer
terminals. The terminals get access to financial information by
dialing up a central computer, which then transmits data over an
established automated teller machine network.
</P>
<P>
   To pay a bill, a customer would provide the name of the company
being paid, the amount to pay, and his or her bank account's
personal identification number. The payment is then deducted from
the bank account.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payments and transfers may be scheduled in advance, or on a
periodic basis,'' the inventors explain in their patent. They
received patent 5,870,724.
</P>
<P>
   Four Japanese inventors see computer kiosks as aids in grocery
shopping. Taichi Sugiyama, Yukio Akimoto, Takafumi Morimoto and
Yoshiyuki Tsuge worked together on a patent that belongs to
Hitachi &UR;  &LR; Ltd. Their idea is for a network of computers that
registers purchases, figures out how often items are purchased, and
notifies the consumer of what he needs to buy on his next shopping
trip.
</P>
<P>
   Their invention relies on a computer system of store terminals
that register purchases via electronic labels. A central computer
manages the data from the individual terminals and sends it to a
home computer, where the customer can review his or her shopping
patterns.
</P>
<P>
   The home terminal ``accumulates the item information from the
store terminal as history, determines a mean purchase interval of
individual items, and decides and notifies the items to be
purchased by the shopper'' during future trips to the store, the
patent explains. The four inventors received patent 5,870,716.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Oberg of Washington, Mo., hopes the kiosk idea will
simplify the process of framing photos or artwork. Oberg has
patented a computer program that analyzes a digital image of an
object to be framed, chooses a frame and mat, and produces a
prototype image of the finished product.
</P>
<P>
   The system uses a digital camera so customers can take photos of
the art they are hoping to have framed. The digital picture is
downloaded into the computer. Once it appears on-screen, the
consumer can crop or change it. The program analyzes the artwork's
color composition, and then searches its data base of frames,
moldings and mats to find a suitable frame. The customer can
experiment with the computer's choices, changing the frame's color,
shape, size or number of openings.
</P>
<P>
   The data base also offers information about framing products,
manufacturers and suppliers, model numbers and cost. Once the
customer is satisfied, the program will print out the composite
image for preview, and store the customer's choices for future
reference. Oberg received patent 5,870,771.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Spector of Union City, N.J., has designed a computer and
printer terminal that he hopes will simplify special occasions. His
kiosk offers custom-made greeting cards bearing a gift certificate.
</P>
<P>
   A buyer chooses graphics and a message addressed to a specific
person for the greeting card, and then selects a monetary figure or
an item as a gift to be included in the card. The buyer chooses the
store where the certificate can be redeemed, drawing from a list of
pre-approved retail outlets that have Internet sites. The card,
with the embedded gift certificate bearing the recipient's name,
gift description and store name, is then printed out. Spector
received patent 5,870,718.
</P>
<P>
   Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and
Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

 &HT;    Bringing Government 301 to life: Texas and Guatemalan students
lead UT democracy project
 &HT;    By Angela Shah
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The bark from the family dog was a brief and
useless signal.
</P>
<P>
   As Magdalena, then 9, and her family slept in the cold night of
early spring, a group of soldiers stormed her one-story white house
in the rural Guatemalan farming town of Patzun. They bound and
dragged off her father. Her mother screamed in protest. Young
Magdalena watched, silent and stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day they took my father away was April 9, 1985, in a leap
year, when dawn comes more quickly,'' said Magdalena Jochula, now
23.
</P>
<P>
   For almost four decades, generations of Guatemalans watched as
friends and family members disappeared during an often brutal civil
war. Many, like Jochula's father, were taken for suspected
involvement in liberation theology, a Christian philosophy used to
free people from economic, social or political injustice.
</P>
<P>
   Most Guatemalans couldn't do anything to stop the military at
the time. But some, like Jochula, are attempting to prevent it from
happening again.
</P>
<P>
   Guatemala's young adults are at the forefront of an effort to
create a nation of their own, 175 years after Guatemala's
independence from Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Following guidelines in peace accords signed in 1996, about 80
students from the University of Texas and two Guatemalan
universities are helping the Guatemalan Congress of Deputies decide
which of the country's 12,000 laws to expunge, which to rewrite and
how to rewrite them.
</P>
<P>
   With a $3 million grant from the U.S. Agency for International
Development, UT is directing the Texas and Guatemalan students in
the Guatemalan Modernization Project. In addition to law making,
they are setting up the sometimes mundane apparatus that keeps
democratic governments functioning: budget boards, legislative
research agencies and the staffs to operate them.
</P>
<P>
   The student volunteers _ most of whom are between 20 and 25
years old _ are invaluable consultants.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are midwives in the birth of a nation,'' said Reginald
Todd, a UT staff member who heads the program's operations in
Guatemala City.
</P>
<P>
   Like other Central American countries, Guatemala fought a
repressive Spain to set up a mostly repressive government of its
own. Other than intermittent spurts when Guatemala had a democratic
government, its history is ripe with episodes of peasant rebellion
against government oppression. The power has always lied with urban
elite, primarily the Spanish upper-class. This has fostered a deep
mistrust of government for the majority of Guatemala's 10 million,
largely indigenous residents.
</P>
<P>
   Guatemala has been ruled by a legal system imposed by Spain,
Todd said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The history of Guatemala is the history of top-down rule,'' he
added. So, the ``country (is) governed more by tradition and custom
than by formal law.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the students believe they can help create a democratic
system of government. Todd likens the modernization program to an
incubator hatching different governmental bodies: a legislative
technical assistance unit, budget analysis group, legislative
committees and a ``delegislative'' group to eliminate conflicting
or obsolete laws.
</P>
<P>
   The students started creating a database last year of the
thousands of laws passed in Guatemala since 1871. Getting the
message out to Guatemalans, who speak more than 23 dialects, is
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us in the program are dreaming always that we can
change our country,'' said Ana Medina, a Guatemalan student who
oversees the legislative research organization. ``The laws are
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Students such as Medina, 26, research requests by Guatemalan
lawmakers that could lead to a bill being filed. Right now, they
have completed 70 legislative studies on potential bills and have
requests for 90 more. A third of those requests are aimed at
banishing Guatemala's ghosts. But there also are questions of how
to prosecute those guilty of torture, kidnapping or extra-legal
killing. Others deal with more practical concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many in the guerrilla movement moved to southern Mexico. Some
married Mexican citizens, had children born in Mexico,'' said Todd.
``One of the questions is what is the citizenship of those people
during those 36 years?''
</P>
<P>
   Jochula and another team of students will meet with local public
service agencies and international relief organizations to gather
input. For example, Jochula is working on drafting adoption laws,
which Guatemala doesn't have, and is talking with international and
regional groups that can provide expertise on such laws in other
Central American countries and around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Todd said the most important thing supporting the students'
efforts is the eagerness of the Guatemalan government's support.
</P>
<P>
   The legislative project also opens up an exchange program
between the Guatemalan students and UT students studying law,
public affairs and other subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Sally Sykes, a UT law and public affairs student who worked with
Jochula in Guatemala City last summer, said the students' idealism
is the key for making the democracy work.
</P>
<P>
   Lariviere agreed. ``We've sent some pretty tough and _ I don't
want to say jaded , let's say experienced _ faculty down there, and
every single one of them comes back full of enthusiasm, and a glint
in their eye they didn't have before,'' he said. ``It's that
idealism and that genuine belief that (the students) can do
something consequential that's infectious.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, 20 of the 80 students have been hired as full-time
staff in the Guatemalan Congress, Todd said. Another 10 have gone
on to graduate school, and 10 other students are working for
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The legislative modernization program also gives Guatemalan
students the chance to study at UT and work in government jobs in
Austin. Medina has an internship in the Texas Senate office of
engrossing and enrolling to learn the mechanics of how bills are
processed and filed. The experience is also giving her the chance
to practice English, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jochula, who will finish law school next year, wants to become a
deputy in the one-house Guatemalan Congress. Self-effacing and
self-confident, she says she wants to be her country's president.
</P>
<P>
   Sykes said Jochula has inspired her.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than anything, I learned about the importance of strength
of character and perseverance,'' Sykes said. ``Magda has the most
incredible attitude that I have ever encountered. She finds the
positive in even the most tragic aspects of her life.''

DAMAGE CONTROL IS FOCUS OF CENTRIST REPUBLICANS' CAUCUS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By KEVIN SACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Exasperated and demoralized, a group of centrist
Republicans caucusing here on the weekend after President Clinton's
acquittal warned that the party must broaden its appeal, recapture
its agenda and isolate its right wing if it expected to heal the
political wounds inflicted in its prosecution of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the speakers who addressed the Republican Leadership
Council over two days, including Govs. Christie Whitman of New
Jersey and John G. Rowland of Connecticut, used unusually blunt
language in assessing the damage to the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are tough times for the Republicans,'' Whitman said in
an address on Saturday morning. ``There are no two ways about
that.'' She added: ``The fact is that many Americans right now have
an impression of the Republican party that's mean-spirited,
vindictive and was not attending to the public's business. It's not
up to us to argue with those critics right now. It's up to us to
figure out how we repair the damage and how we move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland suggested that the fallout from the impeachment and
trial of Clinton on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice
had exacerbated an already entrenched image of Republicans as
negative and intolerant. The Senate trial ended last Friday with
votes of acquittal on both articles of impeachment, with neither
count gaining a majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have done incredible damage, because in my opinion we've
developed a laundry list of people that we're against,'' Rowland
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland, who won re-election to a second term last year, went on
to say that Republican policies and platform planks over the last
two decades had alienated women, union members, immigrants,
minorities, the elderly, teachers, homosexuals and
environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will report to you that the good news is that the rich
people and the business people still like us,'' he said. ``But
that's about it. Unless they can vote four or five times each,
we've got some problems in the next couple of campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting here, at the Doral Golf Resort and Spa, put on
public display the intraparty tensions exposed by the Republicans'
electoral setbacks in November, when the party lost seats in the
House of Representatives, and by its dogged pursuit of a popular
president on charges stemming from an extramarital affair. Although
many in attendance said they saw opportunity in the party's current
misfortunes, the sessions often had the feel of one of those
post-election confabs where party activists gather to assign blame
for a failed strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Leadership Council, once known as the Committee
for Responsible Government, was formed in 1992 in response to what
its founders viewed as the gratuitously intolerant tone of that
year's Republican National Convention in Houston. Its mission
statement promotes the ``fundamental Republican ideals of fiscal
conservatism and social inclusion.'' The group unabashedly seeks to
replicate the methods and successes of the Democratic Leadership
Council, an older organization once led by Clinton that has pushed
Democratic politics toward the center.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the group's leaders support abortion rights. But they
say the council's primary mission is to eliminate all manner of
litmus tests from Republican politics, particularly on social
issues. The group, which spent $3 million on 1998 campaigns through
affiliated political action committees, is closely linked to
Whitman. Its current chairman, Lewis M. Eisenberg, is a Whitman
fund-raiser whom Whitman appointed to lead the Port Authority of
New York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the approximately 70 people at the weekend gathering
said they thought that the party's Washington leadership had shown
itself to be remarkably tone-deaf, at least partly because moderate
voices had been drowned out by an incessant blare from the right.
The clear consequence, they said, has been that public opinion of
Clinton's job performance has risen during the impeachment process
while Republicans have been blamed for leading the country through
a tawdry spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does the Republican-controlled Congress operate under a
mandate that requires it to elect leaders who are homogeneous,
intolerant, good old Southern boys who are prone to say dumb
things?'' asked Richard J. Blank Jr., a securities trader from
Rumson, N.J. ``If we don't deliver good sound bites, we can't put a
new face on our party.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Wertzner, a campaign consultant from Princeton, N.J.,
said the party had bungled its politics twice in six months, first
by making the 1998 off-year election a referendum on impeachment
and then by ignoring the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voters gave their verdict,'' Wertzner said. ``Instead of
listening and following the will of the people, we fought them. And
it should be no surprise that we're paying the price for it.''

   A number of council members warned that the Republicans would
lose the 2000 presidential race, and possibly their congressional
majorities as well, if the party did not move aggressively toward
the middle and show itself to be engaged in kitchen-table issues
like education, tax cuts, health care and Social Security. And it
was vital, said one speaker after another, to stop allowing the
party's social conservatives to define modern-day Republicanism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get away from the perception that all we care about
is whether or not Teletubbies are gay,'' Whitman said, referring to
an article published last week by Jerry Falwell, former leader of
the Moral Majority, suggesting that the creators of the children's
television show intended one of the characters to be a gay role
model.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans aren't an amoral people,'' Whitman said. ``They're
not a people that accept the kind of behavior we've seen in the
White House. But I think part of what has driven Clinton's
positives is their fear of some of the rhetoric that they have
heard from some of the more extreme spokespersons for the
Republican Party that implied, `Yeah, but it's only my morals that
are right and if you don't think exactly the way I think you can't
be a good Republican.'''
</P>
<P>
   John A. Moran, a co-chairman of the group, said the Republicans
would succeed in 2000 only if they ``soften the image of the
party'' and ``avoid ideological purity.'' And Rowland pointed out
that the Democrats had succeeded in the Clinton years largely
because they marginalized their left wing. The Republicans, he
insisted, had to start ignoring the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all due respect, we can't negotiate with them,'' he said.
``They don't want to win.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A number of speakers advised the party to move beyond
impeachment by emulating the strategies of successful Republican
governors.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki of New York, who has been working assiduously
to raise his national profile, told the group Sunday morning that
Republicans could get the party headed in the right direction by
following the lead of governors who ``have stuck to those
Republican philosophies of trust in people, lower taxes, less
government and more freedom for the individual and the private
sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other speakers, Pataki refused to second-guess the
party's congressional leaders or to provide a post-mortem on the
impeachment process. ``I'm proud of our party and what our party
stands for,'' he said. ``That might seem to be self-evident, but
there's been so much gnashing of teeth and internal agonizing and
psychological review. I don't think we need that.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Republican senators, Frank H. Murkowski of Alaska and John
McCain of Arizona, defended the Senate's handling of the
president's trial, saying senators had done what the Constitution
required.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who has formed a presidential campaign exploratory
committee, said that it was not clear yet that the party would
suffer permanent political damage, but that it was vital for the
party to ``get on with an agenda'' that emphasized inclusiveness.

   ISRAEL-ORTHODOX _ JERUSALEM _ In an ominous display of one of
Israel's greatest societal rifts, about 100,000 ultra-Orthodox Jews

   GUATEMALA _ At age 9, Magdalena Jochola watched the military
cart away her father, the first in a line of male relatives
kidnapped, never to be heard from again. For almost 40 years,
generations of Guatemalans watched friends and family members
disappear during an often-brutal civil war. In 1996, peace accords
were signed, leading the way for Magda and about 80 other students
to work toward preventing the brutality from happening again. With
a grant from the U.S. Agency for International Development, UT, two
Guatemalan universities and the fledgling Guatemalan government are
setting up the sometimes mundane apparatus that keeps democratic
governments functioning: budget boards, house research
organizations, etc. They are making recommendations to the
Guatemalan Deputies on which laws to expunge, which laws to rewrite
and how to rewrite them. The students _ most of whom are between
20- and 25-years-old _ are invaluable assistants to Guatemala's
modern-day founding fathers. They are, says the American chief of
party there, ``midwives in the birth of a nation.'' (Brooks, Austin

   GLOBAL-ECON-I (Undated) _ It is still not clear that the
financial upheavals, which began in Thailand in July 1997, will
ever damage the United States. But the collapse of Brazil's
currency in January and the jolt that it brought to markets
worldwide underscored the continuing risks of ``the most serious
financial crisis in a half a century,'' as Clinton called it in his
State of the Union address. This series of four articles is a
narrative of the worldwide financial crisis that over the last 20
months has toppled some governments and hobbled others. The crisis
illustrates how globalization increasingly stitches lives all over
the world into a single economic quilt. In the new economic
landscape that has emerged in recent years, the pool of
international investments has grown to dwarf the sums that
governments can muster, and money zips around the globe far faster
than ever before. The result is a world more prosperous; but also,
perhaps, a bit more wobbly. By Nicholas D. Kristof with Edward
Wyatt. 6,500 words, pix, graphics.

TICKETMASTER AND MICROSOFT SETTLE SUIT ON INTERNET LINKING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.,Ga.) (Eds: Exclusive; See related DILLER-LYCOS) 
(nk) 
By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ticketmaster, a unit of Barry Diller's USA Networks Inc., has
settled its two-year-old lawsuit against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Although the parties agreed not to disclose the terms of the
settlement, executives said the agreement did resolve the suit's
central issue _ whether Microsoft's Sidewalk online city guides
could bypass many of Ticketmaster's advertising-laden Web pages and
link Sidewalk users directly to the ticket-purchase portions of
Ticketmaster's site.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Conn, chief executive of Ticketmaster's Ticketmaster
Online-Citysearch business, said that Microsoft had agreed to no
longer link Sidewalk to pages deep within the Ticketmaster site,
where visitors might not even realize they were using
Ticketmaster's services.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the settlement, the Sidewalk guides will now
point visitors who want to purchase tickets directly to the
Ticketmaster home page _ where Ticketmaster will have ample
opportunity to bathe them in advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides came to terms on Jan. 22, but had not announced
the settlement. Conn disclosed the deal in an interview late last
week.
</P>
<P>
   The case had been widely watched for its potential to establish
a legal precedent on the intellectual property rights of Internet
companies. But with an out-of-court settlement, the online industry
remains without legal guidelines on the practice of so-called deep
linking, of which Microsoft was by no means the only practitioner.
</P>
<P>
   Ticketmaster filed suit in April 1997 in a federal court in
California, arguing that Microsoft had ``pilfered'' its content and
therefore diluted its value. At the time, Ticketmaster had recently
signed a deal with Citysearch, which, like Microsoft's Sidewalk
guides, provides information about local news, merchants and
entertainment in various cities. In that deal Citysearch was
essentially paying Ticketmaster for the right to do what Microsoft
was doing free.
</P>
<P>
   Ticketmaster, which was acquired by Diller's company in 1997,
merged its online division with Citysearch last September to create
Ticketmaster Online-Citysearch.
</P>
<P>
   In its legal defense, Microsoft had argued that Ticketmaster's
stance breached an unwritten Internet code in which any Web site
operator has the right to link to anyone else's site. Microsoft
also based its defense on what it said was its First Amendment
right to publish public information.
</P>
<P>
   But with the settlement, those in the industry looking for the
federal court's guidance were disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it's in the best interest of the parties, but for the
purpose of providing meaningful guidance to the Internet community,
this is the worst news I've heard all day,'' Jeffrey Kuester, an
Internet law specialist and a partner in the Atlanta law firm
Thomas, Kayden, Horstemeyer &AMP; Risley, said when told of the
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were hoping to hear some good, broad, general language from
the court,'' Kuester said. ``Now, do we know if deep linking is
bad? Is linking to a main home page OK? Is it just not OK to link?
We don't know.''

 By SAUL HANSELL and GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   For much of the last three decades, to ask the question ``What
is the hottest fad in the media business?'' is to invite the
responding query, ``What is Barry Diller up to now?''
</P>
<P>
   From his start as an ABC programmer, brainstorming
movies-of-the-week in network television's heyday in the early
1970s, Diller found ways to surf the trends of the moment. After
subsequently running Paramount Pictures, he spent most of the 1980s
building Rupert Murdoch's Fox Television into a viable alternative
to the Big Three networks, mining the premise that there was a
younger, hipper audience than ABC, CBS and NBC were delivering to
advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the 90s, running the home-shopping channel QVC and
later the Home Shopping Network, he has demonstrated that
advertising is not the only way to derive revenue from the
remote-control constituency. From there, it was only a mouse-click
or two to the realization that the Internet could be a lot like
what some people used to call interactive TV.
</P>
<P>
   So, Diller was soon extending the Home Shopping Network onto the
World Wide Web. Then he was acquiring the electronic ticketing
agent Ticketmaster and melding it with the city-guide Web company
Citysearch _ even as he was also amassing a more conventional set
of media holdings through his television empire, USA Networks Inc.
</P>
<P>
   All this past was prelude to Barry Diller's latest multimedia
move. Last week he proposed a three-way shuffling of high-priced
stock certificates through which Diller hopes to come out
controlling a new company that would combine Lycos, a popular
portal to the World Wide Web, with the electronic shopping holdings
of his current company, USA Networks Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The new operation, to be called the USA Lycos Interactive
Networks, would entertain, inform and sell things to people online,
on television and over the telephone. It was valued at $22 billion
when it was announced on Tuesday, before Wall Street panned the
deal, sending the shares of Lycos _ and the deal's prospects _
tumbling.
</P>
<P>
   That initial investor skepticism does not mean Diller will not
carry out the plan, of course. After all, Diller's best-known
enterprises previously, the Fox Network and QVC, were seen as media
Siberias when he started. But he was able to fire up enough
perceived heat, and real business value, to create the next media
sensation.
</P>
<P>
   But the task of mastering both the style and substance of this
deal will be Diller's toughest yet, since he has before never run
something with as many disparate lines of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barry has been brilliant in building the company,'' said John
Tinker an analyst with Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities. ``He has
done OK in managing it. But now the challenge will be pulling all
this together.''
</P>
<P>
   Diller argues that the complexity of his new deal reflects a
world in which media companies and retailers are increasingly
intertwined. Significantly, given his continued interest in the
convergence of old, passive media and new, interactive ones, USA
Lycos would aim to make its money as much from retailing as from
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really do believe that there is a new convergence between
information, entertainment and direct selling,'' he said in an
interview last week. ``Once you have the technology for
interactivity, you can have direct selling and you can bypass the
middleman.''
</P>
<P>
   Diller's road to the media shopping mall began in 1992, as he
was looking for a venture after leaving Fox. Diller first noticed
QVC on the recommendation of a friend, the fashion designer Diane
Von Furstenberg. He marveled at QVC's capacity to translate a
focused hour of televised product pitching into a frenzy of
phoned-in sales orders.
</P>
<P>
   So it was no accident that when Diller moved on to the Home
Shopping Network, he became keenly interested the company's small
outpost on the Web, the Internet Shopping Network, which was one of
the first online computer stores. Diller decided that computers had
too low a profit margin, and so he closed the store. But in its
place he created First Auction, a site that offers some of the
costume jewelry and collectibles sold on Home Shopping Network
along with other merchandise like furniture, all of which have much
higher profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   The auction format, which has also been successfully adopted by
Web companies like E-Bay, has transformed shopping on the Internet
from a utilitarian exercise in ordering to the blend of
entertainment and sport that has made TV shopping channels so
successful.
</P>
<P>
   First Auction's sales are now running at a $40 million annual
rate, with few of the costs faced by Internet start-ups because it
can use the warehouses and computer systems of the Home Shopping
Network.
</P>
<P>
   But until now, Diller's efforts to link the Internet and
television have been modest and limited to some First Auction
promotions on the Home Shopping Network.
</P>
<P>
   He has found few ways to cross-promote his company's television
operations _ the Home Shopping Network and the USA Network, a cable
channel specializing in original series as well as movies, and its
sibling, the Sci-Fi Network. Each network, he says, has a very
different profile _ with Home Shopping appealing to older women and
USA going after a younger audience.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Over all, however, analysts give Diller good, if not excellent
grades, for his record of running the companies he has acquired.
</P>
<P>
   Since coming to the money-losing Home Shopping Network in late
1995, Diller has turned it around. Last year, cash flow _ or
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization _
was $330.3 million and revenue of $1.07 billion. Yet, it trails
QVC, which despite reaching one-third fewer homes is expected to
report 1998 revenue of well over $2 billion and cash flow above
$400 million.
</P>
<P>
   But making deals may well be Diller's most notable
accomplishment lately. Take his purchase of Ticketmaster, in two
transactions in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after gaining control of Ticketmaster, Diller realized
that the company's small but rapidly growing Internet ticket sales
site was as big as many of the Internet start-ups that were
receiving huge valuations in the stock market. So he split off that
business as Ticketmaster Online and merged it with Citysearch, a
somewhat struggling effort to create Web-based local entertainment
guides in major cities that had been started by an eccentric
entrepreneur, Bill Gross.
</P>
<P>
   With a combination of good timing and sales panache, Diller was
able to sell 10 percent of Ticketmaster Online Citysearch in
December in a public stock offering at $14 a share. Its shares
subsequently rose as high as $80, although they are now less than
half that, closing Friday at $36.50.
</P>
<P>
   Still, USA's portion is worth about $1.6 billion, far more than
the $610 million it paid for all of Ticketmaster. In fact, it is
the high market value of Ticketmaster Online's stock that has given
Diller the chips to raise his stakes in the Internet market.
</P>
<P>
   Diller was worried about other big media companies activities
online _ like the Walt Disney Co.'s effort to tie all of its media
properties into one all-encompassing Internet portal, the Go
Network. Among many other things, Go intends to offer the sort of
local information that Citysearch does.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sat around watching what Disney was doing,'' Diller said,
``and said if we don't get a relationship with a national portal,
our desire to play a big game will be toast.''
</P>
<P>
   Diller began talking with a number of portal providers, and
three weeks ago started talks with Lycos, which had been conducting
its own public search for a partner.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Diller proposed merging Ticketmaster Online Citysearch
with Lycos. But the conversations soon expanded to include First
Auction and then the rest of the Home Shopping Network _ along with
the old-fashioned, telephone-sales portion of Ticketmaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized we had to put HSN in with all its merchandizing
power and ability to be a real retailer on the Net,'' Diller said.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of $1.5 billion in shopping revenue particularly
appealed to Robert Davis, the chief executive of Lycos, which is
based in Framingham, Mass. He has long prided himself on having a
New England frugality that contrasts sharply with the Internet new
math practiced by many of his Silicon Valley competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lycos, Yahoo, Excite and the rest have been all dependent on
pure advertising revenue,'' Davis said in an interview last week.
``We believe that by moving to having more commerce and transaction
revenue, we can have real earnings fiber.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the new game plan looked disappointing to holders of Lycos
stock, which plummeted on word of the deal. Lycos shareholders had
hoped that the company would be acquired for a big premium, the way
that the portal Excite recently sold itself to the Internet-cable
company At Home for nearly double Excite's stock market price. Even
CMGI Inc., the investment company that took Lycos public in 1996
and still owns 20 percent of it, hinted it might vote against the
deal if the company's stock stayed low.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, Lycos had bounced back somewhat. But it ended the
week at $99.50, down 22 percent from its price before the deal was
announced on Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   By week's end, even the initial enthusiasm of USA Networks'
shareholders seemed to have faded, as the stock closed on Friday at
$38 _ 12.5 cents higher than they were last Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Diller contends that any recalcitrant Lycos shareholders do not
understand the deal, which he said would give them something rare _
a stake in an Internet company with real revenues and earnings.
</P>
<P>
   As for the remaining pieces of USA Networks, Diller has definite
plans to go on a shopping spree to build it into a bigger, more
conventional media conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will see us looking for opportunities to add cable
networks, broadcast stations and probably film production and
distribution,'' Diller said.
</P>
<P>
   But Diller's history of testing the outer boundaries of
new-media models suggests that he will not be content to
concentrate solely on conventional film, cable and broadcasting. If
he can get Wall Street to endorse last week's USA Lycos deal,
Diller would control an Internet company with a market
capitalization in excess of $20 billion.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ At the top of the hill that climbs into this ancient
city, about 250,000 ultra-Orthodox Jews gathered Sunday for what
amounted to a black-hat power rally, unprecedented in size and
markedly tranquil in tone.
</P>
<P>
   Convened as a protest against the Supreme Court's supposedly
anti-religious judicial ``tyranny,'' it was really a show of
solidarity by the ultra-Orthodox, who, in their traditional black
hats and coats, swayed in prayer under the watchful eyes and
helicopter surveillance of a heavy police presence.
</P>
<P>
   At the bottom of the hill, in a counter-rally with a decidedly
different flavor, about 50,000 academics, lawyers, kibbutzniks, and
devoted secularists waved Israeli flags, sang the national anthem
and cheered fiery pro-democracy speakers while munching cotton
candy and drinking Coke.
</P>
<P>
   In between and around the two camps was a cordon of 2,000 police
officers, dubbed ``Operation Static Electricity.'' But the feared
violence never erupted, and the culture war over Israel's identity,
which seemed to be building to an explosion, remained at a
stand-off _ religious and secular Jews, a few hundred yards and a
world apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is not to get into a conflict, but to make ourselves
be seen and heard,'' said Avi Stein, a religious man, as he smoked
a Marlboro at prayer's end. ``We feel toward the others, the
seculars, that they're brothers who made a mistake with their
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Such relatively conciliatory language was not the mood of the
week leading up to the huge rally by the ultra-Orthodox, known here
as the haredim, literally those who tremble before God. Instead,
religious leaders made a series of vitriolic attacks on the Supreme
Court, which they believe to be overstepping its bounds by ruling
against them on matters of religion and state.
</P>
<P>
   All week long, the tone was so combative that the country's
political leaders worked hard, if unsuccessfully, to persuade the
organizers to call off Sunday's event, which packed 1,000 buses
with religious Jews following their rabbis' orders to attend. The
politicians feared the rabbis had whipped the religious group into
a frenzy that would climax in clashes with the police and the
secular community.
</P>
<P>
   But, following loudspeaker announcements warning the haredim to
keep their cool, a ram's horn blew loud and triumphant, and a sea
of black-hatted men began bobbing in unison over mimeographed
prayer sheets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very obedient crowd,'' said David Zilbershlag, an
ultra-Orthodox advertising executive and spokesman for the
demonstration. ``When they were told to come, even if they did not
really understand this issue, they came. And when they were told
that they needed to disperse in total silence, they dispersed in
total silence.''
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away, the Supreme Court held business as usual
Sunday, although it was ringed by armed troops. And, after a week
in which the judges were attacked as ``enemies of Judaism'' who
issued ``anti-Semitic'' decisions, each justice traveled to and
from court with at least one personal body guard.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday morning, preparing for what they expected might be
hostilities, Tel Aviv University students, their classes canceled,
decorated placards as a leader told them: ``People should
understand that blood could be shed, and people could drop like
flies.''
</P>
<P>
   But once the pro-democracy crowd had gathered at Sacher Park in
Jerusalem, the notion of bloodshed seemed implausible. The
atmosphere was defiant, but festive, and the speakers' combative
words descended on a crowd lounging in the grass under a brilliant
sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a war in Israel, a struggle of life and death for
Israeli democracy,'' said one speaker, Avraham Burg, a Labor Party
member and head of the Jewish Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Several political commentators suggested Sunday that the
haredim, fearful of losing power, were trying to flex their muscle
in advance of the May 17 elections.
</P>
<P>
   As a crucial bloc of votes in Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's governing coalition, the haredim have enjoyed
considerable power during his tenure. Politicians from religious
parties controlled seven ministries, including housing, education
and labor, and they traded their support for Netanyahu's agenda for
more money for their constituency. But it is considered unlikely
that they will play such a key role in the next administration,
even if Netanyahu is re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the haredim have been losing battles in the
Supreme Court, which has repeatedly struck at the Orthodox
community's power and privileges in Israeli society. They called
the rally in anticipation of a hearing next week on the thorny
issue of conversion _ which raises the sensitive question of who is
a Jew.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We, the haredi Jews, are pro-democracy, but we don't think the
court should answer that question because what do they know on the
subject,'' said Moshe Rolnick, who moved to Israel from Flatbush,
Brooklyn, 13 years ago. ``The Supreme Court happens to be a clique
of leftist and extremely anti-religious men.''
</P>
<P>
   Avraham Leizerson, an ultra-Orthodox member of Parliament, said
his constituents felt ``choked and persecuted and helpless'' as
they were increasingly disdained by secular society.
</P>
<P>
   At each rally, Israelis spoke of the other side's mounting
disrespect. And in the cases where their paths crossed, they argued
furiously and spitefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here at this democracy demonstration because I despise the
haredim,'' said Gadi Suisser, who shook his finger in the face of
an ultra-Orthodox man. ``I'm a traditional person from Morocco, and
I think you've taken Judaism and castrated it, and wrung out its
soul. You think no one else in this country has morals? You think
you're holier than the overwhelming majority of Israelis?''
</P>
<P>
   The religious man asked if he was finished, and then answered.
``I think Jewish law is holier than the law of the land,'' he said.
``The man who has Torah holds the answers to life's questions in
his hand. You want to go to pubs on the Sabbath? The Torah doesn't
allow it. Sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   This enraged Chana Schwartz-Eisler, a high school teacher from
Kfar Saba. ``You bunch of no good parasites,'' she said. ``Throwing
stones at cars on the Sabbath you find time for. But God forbid you
should work.''
</P>
<P>
   In calling on his fellow ``die-hard seculars'' to come out for
the protest, Israeli novelist A.B. Yehoshua said theirs should be a
demonstration for democracy rather than against the ultra-Orthodox.
The conflict over the balance between Jewish and secular law in the
Jewish homeland will be a chronic one, he said, and it is important
to defuse the volatility of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a structural problem, like the problem always in
America between the federal government and the states,'' he said.
``In 200 years, there will still be someone who will speak about
why the Supreme Court has too much power. It is built into our
nature, because we will never entirely separate religion from
state.''

REFILING TO FIX CODING 
`MONICA'S STORY' UNFOLDS IN FLATIRON BUILDING
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the landmark Flatiron building, which houses St.
Martin's Press, elevators move with all desultory speed so there
was plenty of time last week for the various occupants to discuss
sightings of the fabled ``she.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is she still there?'' one employee asked another on the
downward descent from the 16th floor to the lobby. No first or last
names needed. Everyone seemed to know that Monica Lewinsky and her
new literary confidante, Andrew Morton, were ensconced in an
office, plotting the delicate strategy for the promotion of the
tell-more title, ``Monica's Story.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Martin's, a division of Macmillan Publishers Ltd., is still
planning on a late February publication date for the 288-page
portrait of the former White House intern by Morton, if a
court-imposed order of silence on Ms. Lewinsky is lifted. (``We're
just taking it day to day,'' John Murphy, a St. Martin's spokesman,
said.) But the book is apparently so eagerly anticipated (or
reviled) that potential readers started posting early reviews and
lewd critiques on the online bookstore, Amazon.com, which
eventually removed them.
</P>
<P>
   St. Martin's, which is initially printing at least 400,000
copies, is casting the book as a tale of a ``generous-hearted, but
troubled young woman'' who was betrayed by her friend, Linda Tripp,
and thrust as a pawn into a power struggle between President
Clinton and the Office of the Independent Counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Left unsaid is that Ms. Lewinsky got her book deal while Ms.
Tripp was still searching for sympathy, public rehabilitation and,
perhaps, a curious publisher. Ms. Tripp professes that she has no
plans for a book, although she does not rule it out.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the top publishing houses that could offer a
generous advance are unlikely to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her chances are less than zero,'' said an executive at a top
New York publishing house, who insisted on anonymity. ``She is
truly seen as the true harridan of this whole ghastly experience, a
woman who engenders no sympathy from either side of the
controversy. The perception here is that she is such an
unsympathetic figure and so unlikable that there would be an unduly
small number of people interested in her book.''
</P>
<P>
   Publishing well may be the best revenge.

   FALWELL TAKES ON THE TELETUBBIES
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jerry Falwell provoked laughter last week when he
chastised ``Teletubbies,'' a popular public television program for
children under the age of 3, accusing one of the cuddly, cooing,
antenna-topped characters, the purple one named Tinky Winky, of
``modeling the gay lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenn Viselman, the man responsible for promoting the
British-made show in the United States, can laugh all the way to
the bank. An estimated $800 million worth of Teletubby products _
toys, videos, pajamas and the like _ were sold in 1998, with PBS
getting a cut, said Jim Silver, the publisher of The Toy Book, a
toy industry trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the show did not make its PBS debut until April, and
products did not go on sale until June, the best-selling item in
the preschool plush-toy category for 1998 was the Talking Teletubby
(when squeezed it says, ``Eh-oh,'' for hello, and ``Bye-bye'').
</P>
<P>
   The Falwell furor happened to erupt during the week-long annual
Toy Fair in New York, which ends Monday.
</P>
<P>
   At the fair, Viselman presented the newest Tubby plush toy, one
with a rudimentary Microsoft computer in its tummy.
</P>
<P>
   An article in the February edition of Falwell's publication,
National Liberty Journal, argues that Tinky Winky is meant to be
gay because he has a boy's voice yet carries a red purse, he is
purple (``the gay-pride color'') and his antenna is a triangle
(``the gay-pride symbol'').
</P>
<P>
   On the ``Today'' show on NBC last week, Falwell told Katie
Couric that to have ``little boys running around with purses and
acting effeminate and leaving the idea that the masculine male, the
feminine female is out and gay is OK'' is something ``which
Christians do not agree with.''
</P>
<P>
   Viselman, who was also on the program, countered: ``We're
talking about a show for 1- to 4-year-olds. If we had homosexuals
in it, they wouldn't even know it,'' adding quickly, ``but we
don't.''
</P>
<P>
   After a busy day at Toy Fair, Silver said last Friday that
Falwell had probably helped the Teletubbies' business.
</P>
<P>
   ``All he's done is make a mockery of himself, and if anything
put more attention on Teletubbies and increases sales,'' he said.

   MEDIA BUYERS WORRY ABOUT THE TIMING AT TALK
</P>
<P>
   The announcement last week that Talk magazine would arrive on
newsstands in August _ the offspring of Miramax Films, which is
owned by the Walt Disney Co., and Hearst Magazines _ caused a
flurry of discussion in several industries.
</P>
<P>
   In the world of advertising, media buyers said that they were
concerned with what they perceived to be the late start in selling
ad pages for Talk. Roberta Garfinkle, the director of print media
at McCann-Erickson, a unit of the Interpublic Group of Cos., said
she would have liked to have seen Talk sell its ad pages earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``With an August launch, I think March is a little bit on the
late side to start selling advertising,'' she said, referring to
need of media buyers to plan yearlong schedules. ``Is it going to
hurt them substantially? No. But I think that there may be some
instances where budgets have been committed and it's too late to
make changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Writers wondered about pay days. Hiring writers at Hearst may
not prove as easy as it was with Conde Nast, a company known for
being extremely generous with writers' salaries. Ms. Brown said
that she was negotiating to hire a dozen writers away from other
publications, but was not able to announce who she was hiring yet.
``Their bosses don't know,'' she said. But writers who have been
approached by Ms. Brown's magazine have said that they were
surprised that salaries were not as high as expected.
</P>
<P>
   And in Hollywood, there had been rumors that Michael D. Eisner,
the chairman of the Walt Disney Co., did not know about Miramax's
involvement with Ms. Brown until very late in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, however, Eisner said, ``I have been trying to make a
deal with Tina for several years.'' As to whether starting a
magazine was risky, he said, ``I measure high risk by talent, and
Tina Brown is so talented that it puts a conservative bent on the
risk.''
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with Ms. Black, Ms. Brown, Ron Galotti, the
publisher of Talk, and Harvey Weinstein, the co-chairman of Miramax
Films, Weinstein said that he was certain Ms. Brown and Galotti
would not be wasteful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been out to dinner 10 times with Ron, and he's never once
picked up the check,'' Weinstein said. ``He's frugal, I
guarantee.''

   NEW YORK _ Them were the days.
</P>
<P>
   A street tough named McGiff got himself skewered in Prospect
Park with an Army surplus bayonet.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Vivelo, himself a tough and later a New York City police
sergeant and now a dispatcher for a car service on Staten Island,
saw it happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched the blade go in and I watched the blade come out.
McGiff lived,'' marveled Vivelo, although he said the man later
died of heroin addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Rekindled by photographs taken 40 years ago, such brass-knuckled
memories overwhelmed a gathering this weekend of the remnants of a
Brooklyn street gang. They assembled at an Upper East Side gallery
to commemorate black-and-white images of themselves frozen in late
1950s cool.
</P>
<P>
   Men pushing 60, with wives and grown children listening in
wide-eyed amazement, rhapsodized about fist fights that occurred
during the Eisenhower administration.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Fenton, then a gangly Irish kid with a pompadour and now
a part-time writer and full-time court clerk at the state Supreme
Court in Queens, remembered a drunken fight not so much for the
punches as for its ending. ``We both threw up,'' Fenton said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert ``Bengie'' Powers, a former drug dealer and heroin addict
and now an addiction counselor, said he never once won a fight
unless three or four of ``you guys held somebody down and I could
beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   The reunion took place, around a table with pizzas and sodas, in
a first-floor conference room at the International Center of
Photography on Fifth Avenue at 94th Street. On the floor above, a
sizable Saturday crowd of paying customers inspected 50 photographs
of the gang as they were in the summer of 1959, skinny and
brooding, showing off tattoos and smooching with girls under the
boardwalk at Coney Island.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering was the work of Powers, who tracked down eight
other gang members and their families, and of Bruce Davidson, the
New York photographer who, when he was 25, spent several
nerve-jangling months hanging out in Brooklyn, carefully making
pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very scared,'' Davidson remembered. ``They were very
unpredictable. I was never sure if their anger was going to focus
on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Violent youth gangs were a much-publicized problem in New York
City at the end of the 1950s. A Youth Board was created by the city
to try to stop their fights. The New York Times wrote a seven-part,
front-page series in 1958 examining the antisocial behavior of
adolescents in the ``shook-up'' generation. The series had a
glossary that defined ``rumble'' as a gang fight.
</P>
<P>
   From the calming distance of four decades, there is a temptation
to see in Davidson's photographs a certain sweetness, even hope.
These were teen-agers who hung out in candy stores, after all, not
crack houses. They fretted about dance contests, not drive-by
shootings. They crossed themselves when walking by churches; they
did not murder rivals with 9-millimeter semiautomatic handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Many of teen-agers in the photographs, however, inhabited a
working-class Brooklyn where sweetness and hope were in desperately
short supply. If they had had guns, several former gang members
said, they probably would have used them.
</P>
<P>
   Powers, whose printed recollections narrate the photo exhibit,
is remembered by Davidson as endlessly angry, ``like some kind of
wired marmot.'' Like the other members of the gang that called
themselves the ``Jokers'' and the ``Eighth Avenue Boys,'' Powers
grew up in a mostly Irish neighborhood near Prospect Park, a place,
he said, where ``a kid wished he was dead a million times.''
</P>
<P>
   For gang members, it was a neighborhood where Catholic families
were large, but cold. Fathers drank boilermakers for breakfast
before heading off to gray factories that lined the Brooklyn
waterfront. Factories kept closing in those years, tormenting
unskilled men who had limited options and unlimited obligations. As
gang members remember it, fathers self-medicated in street-corner
bars before heading home, sometimes to take out their troubles on
wives and children.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers, too, were exhausted and often embittered from the
ordeal of six or eight or 10 pregnancies, from the importuning of
children and from the periodic uselessness of husbands. Powers says
that both his parents, who lived in a five-room apartment with
their eight children, were alcoholics and, for him, unreachable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that they treated me bad,'' Powers said. ``They
didn't treat me.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the gang members did not have automatic weapons, they
were _ by their own admission _ itching to fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did we fight with chains and pipes and knives? Yeah,'' said
Powers, a small man with pale watery blue eyes, a gray pony tail
and two studs in his left ear. ``Did people get stabbed? Yeah,
people got stabbed. And people got their heads cracked open with
bats.''
</P>
<P>
   Powers and others at the reunion argued that they had more guts
than gang members today who shoot at rivals from moving cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drive-by shootings?'' Powers asked. ``What does that take? It
takes a nut job, as far as I am concerned. How about standing in
front of somebody and punching it out?''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The saddest story behind Davidson's photographs is that of
Howard ``Junior'' Rice and Cathy O'Neal, the gang couple whose cool
and beauty were without compare. No one had the heart to tell their
story last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Junior was the Romeo of the street gang. He wore sunglasses
everywhere and carried a copy of Alan Ginsberg's ``Howl'' in his
back pocket. He had the pick of girls on Eighth Avenue and his pick
was Cathy, a 13-year-old blonde he thought looked like Brigitte
Bardot.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy, in the most famous of Davidson's gang photographs, fusses
with her long golden hair in the mirror of a Coney Island cigarette
machine. She loved Junior and he loved her. Davidson photographed
them embracing while lying on the sand underneath the boardwalk.
She became pregnant with his child before she was 15 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Rice, who is now 57 but whose Brooklyn friends still call him
Junior, remembers that everything went wrong after Cathy became
pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to a judge and got permission to get married, which my
parents weren't happy about,'' Rice said. ``Our daughter passed
away after 15 months, and I went into a self-destructive mode and
so did she. We got divorced. There was a lot of shame.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice said he took street fighting to ``the extreme,'' using
bats, chains and knives. ``I used to go out there and fight and I
didn't know what I was fighting about,'' Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he became a drug dealer, selling hundreds of thousands
of dollars worth of heroin, and the ``profits went up my arm.'' He
had several failed marriages and is now unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. O'Neal committed suicide years later with a shotgun.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There are several others from the gang who are dead, from
cirrhosis, from drugs, from bullets fired outside a bar.
</P>
<P>
   Yet around the table at the gallery, it was noisily apparent
that gang life could give way to better things. There were two
retired police officers, an electrician, a retired transit worker,
a hospital administrator, a singer. There were handsome grown-up
children who came of age in New Jersey or on Long Island and who
know nothing of gangs, except from the papers and dad's stories
over dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The one gang member at the reunion who has inhabited both
hopelessness and a measure of middle-class contentment is Powers.
For most of 18 years, he said, he was drunk, addicted to heroin and
selling drugs. He said he stabbed two people, squandered a marriage
and needed his sisters to take care of his children while he served
time in jail.
</P>
<P>
   For the last 15 years, Powers, 56, said he has been clean and
sober. He works in midtown as an addiction counselor. On weekends,
he baby-sits his grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end, I was living in the streets,'' Powers said. ``I
was in Prospect Park, sleeping on the same benches where I drank
when I was 15. I had pancreatitis and the shakes. There were no
more drugs, just Wild Irish Rose. They wheeled me into detox at
Kings County Hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, sober, Powers decided to learn to read. Growing
up, he had dyslexia and was kicked out of Catholic and public
schools for fighting; he had never learned how to read. In his 40s,
he studied in computerized literacy classes on Staten Island,
sitting on small chairs with 6-year-old children who, he said, were
smarter than him.
</P>
<P>
   It took five years, but he learned. He has a driver's license
and a car. He lives now in Brighton Beach in an apartment building
where most residents speak only Russian. He jogs every morning on
the Coney Island boardwalk, past the places where he used to be
cool.
</P>
<P>
   Powers is leaving New York soon for a vacation in Florida. It is
the kind of trip that for all his ganged-up, drugged-out Brooklyn
life would have been impossible. He said he has enough money to
enjoy himself, and he does not have to answer to a methadone
program, a counselor or a judge. He will, though, call home and
check on the grandchildren.

BASIC DIVISIONS IN NATO PIT EUROPEANS AGAINST U.S.
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The NATO alliance, as it approaches its 50th anniversary
celebrations in Washington in April, is hardly one big, happy
family.
</P>
<P>
   While the latest squabbles have been over how to share the
burdens of placing troops in Kosovo, the division is bigger than
any single issue, running to core of the future mission of the
alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The European allies are complaining about American
highhandedness, the elevated place of what the French call American
hyperpower and what Europeans see as a growing tendency by
Washington to go it alone.
</P>
<P>
   American officials answer that they welcome a more active role
for the Europeans, but that the Europeans are incapable of taking
the lead, even when the United States offers it to them.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side really seems to believe that the other side means
what it says. Some military officials even worry that Congress may
eventually get so fed up that it will wash its hands of the whole
mess.
</P>
<P>
   The discord is such that France, the loudest voice of European
complaint, now seems to spend nearly as much time trying to counter
American power as to cooperate with it.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the Europeans are demanding more say in fashioning a
new purpose for the alliance, and American officials are
increasingly concerned about French-led efforts to make European
defense less dependent on American leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States of America today predominates on the
economic level, on the monetary level, on the military level, on
the technological level, and in the cultural area in the broad
sense of the word,'' the French Foreign Minister, Hubert Vedrine,
said in a recent speech in Paris. ``It is not comparable, in terms
of power and influence, to anything known in modern history.''
</P>
<P>
   While French leaders since de Gaulle have chafed at American
dominance, both President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin's government have been saying since last summer that
multilateral institutions, from the International Monetary Fund to
the United Nations, should be strengthened to offset American
influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire foreign policy of France, among other objectives,
is aimed at making the world of tomorrow composed of several poles,
not just a single one,'' Vedrine said. Chirac, a few weeks earlier,
said avoiding ``unilateral temptations'' should be the first
principle of the multipolar international order.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac plans a short working visit to the United States starting
on Thursday, a week after a visit by German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder, who has himself raised similar concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``That there is a danger of unilateralism, not by just anybody
but by the United States, is undeniable,'' Schroeder said at the
Munich Conference on Security Policy, a gathering of allied
officials and strategists, early this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want a new Europe for a new NATO,'' he said, ``and we want
a new NATO for a new Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   The German foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, also in Munich,
added that the ``growing tendency to avoid multilateral solutions''
should be seen by Europe as ``a challenge to build up its own
political authority.''
</P>
<P>
   The Germans have also irritated the United States by calling on
NATO to say it would not be the first to use nuclear weapons in
conflict with any adversary who also has them, a proposal rejected
by almost all the other allies but welcomed by Canada.
</P>
<P>
   European policymakers, an American official said recently,
apparently did not realize how much some of the sounds coming out
of Europe these days, particularly from Paris, have irritated
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The United States still hopes to get the allies, in their visits
to Washington, to redefine ``collective security'' to include
threats from missiles and weapons of mass destruction from outside
NATO's traditional turf. The French, however, are leading the fight
to keep the alliance's new strategy down to earth.
</P>
<P>
   The French defense minister, Alain Richard, warned those present
at the Munich forum, ``Approach with caution any new formula
implying that one of the essential tasks of the alliance ought to
be to make it the `policeman of the world,' with the mission of
dealing with crises all over the globe.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same gathering, Secretary of Defense William Cohen
challenged the European allies to put their money where their mouth
was. The United States, he said, had plans for $112 billion in
additional military spending over the next six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it may not be possible for all alliance members to seek
and secure dramatically increased defense budgets, we believe that
if the alliance is to exist in word and deed, in fighting capacity
as well as political appeal, then, at a minimum, defense budgets
cannot be reduced further,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Europe is tired of being an economic power but a
political and strategic dwarf, as it has been for most of the last
50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Even Britain, which alone among the European allies has joined
the United States in bombing Iraq over Russian objections, went
along with France in early December with a call for the European
Union to have ``the capacity for autonomous action, backed up by
credible military forces.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain's defense secretary, George Robertson, assured his
American colleagues in Munich, ``America has nothing to fear from a
European defense identity within the Atlantic Alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   The French, however, are unhappy with the degree of increased
authority the United States is prepared to give Europe within NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since President Kennedy, we've been hearing from people on the
other side of the Atlantic about a European pillar for the
alliance,'' Vedrine said. ``In reality, this pillar is never
built.'' The reason is that NATO is built on a ``hierarchical
foundation with a strict subordination of all participants'' to the
United States, which he conceded, insures the ``credibility of the
whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander R. Vershbow, the American representative to NATO,
reassured the Europeans in Munich that the Clinton administration
would not try, at the Washington NATO summit meeting, to drag the
allies into following the United States wherever it wanted to go,
from Iraq to North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that there is going to be a radical widening of
alliance responsibilities is a misreading of the situation,'' he
said. ``The new strategic concept is really going to reflect the
changes NATO has already undergone in the past 10 years.''

   GLOBAL-ECON-I (Undated) _ It is still not clear that the
financial upheavals, which began in Thailand in July 1997, will
ever damage the United States. But the collapse of Brazil's
currency in January and the jolt that it brought to markets
worldwide underscored the continuing risks of ``the most serious
financial crisis in a half a century,'' as Clinton called it in his
State of the Union address. This series of four articles is a
narrative of the worldwide financial crisis that over the last 20
months has toppled some governments and hobbled others. The crisis
illustrates how globalization increasingly stitches lives all over
the world into a single economic quilt. In the new economic
landscape that has emerged in recent years, the pool of
international investments has grown to dwarf the sums that
governments can muster, and money zips around the globe far faster
than ever before. The result is a world more prosperous; but also,
perhaps, a bit more wobbly. By Nicholas D. Kristof with Edward
Wyatt.

MARKETING HELPED TURN SMALL COMPANY INTO A POWERHOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Calif.) (rk) 
 By GLENN RIFKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Much has been written about Cisco Systems Inc. and
how it rose from obscurity to market prominence by providing the
switches and routers that form the plumbing of the Internet. But
there is another, more obscure, player that has reaped Internet
rewards by producing a fundamental piece of technology.
</P>
<P>
   The EMC Corp. is to data storage what Cisco is to routers. But
few outside of Wall Street and corporate data centers are familiar
with this emerging technology powerhouse. Based in Hopkinton,
Mass., on the far western reaches of metropolitan Boston's Route
128 high-technology belt, EMC dominates the $10 billion market for
large data storage systems _ a market it wrested from IBM.
</P>
<P>
   EMC, which had revenue of $4 billion last year, provides the
storage systems for corporate computer systems _ not only
mainframes but also the power network server computers through
which corporate America uses the Internet. And America Online, as
well as seven of the other 10 largest Internet service providers,
employ EMC storage systems as their main data repositories.
</P>
<P>
   Although EMC was founded 20 years ago, it was only in the 1990s
that the company rose to the leadership of the large data storage
market _ a category encompassing both hardware and software that is
expected to reach $35 billion by 2001, according to the Dataquest
research house. With the Internet creating a seemingly insatiable
appetite for storage, and with corporate computing needs growing
apace, EMC has seen its annual profits surge from $30 million in
1992 to nearly $800 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Its stock _ which closed on Friday at $102.375, down $1.75 _ has
been the second-best performer in the S&AMP;P 500 in the 1990s, with a
return of more than 32,000 percent, second only to Dell Computer's
50,000 percent. Its stock market value, more than $50 billion, is
larger than for companies like American Express, Boeing and
Motorola.
</P>
<P>
   Part of EMC's success lies in its having embraced an approach
that might be called radical marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Radical marketers emphasize listening to customers; creating a
community atmosphere among customers who are served by employees
and salespeople who are expected to take a missionary's zeal to
their work. Marketing is also made one of the top priorities of the
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Successful organizations in a wide range of endeavors _
including Harley-Davidson Motorcycles, Providian Financial and Iams
pet food _ have employed radical marketing techniques to overcome
the larger advertising budgets and giant marketing machines of
their bigger competitors.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of EMC, the tone was set by the co-founder and
chairman, Richard J. Egan, and the chief executive, Michael C.
Ruettgers, who joined the company in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1990, EMC had no measurable share of the market
for mainframe data storage. At that time, IBM owned three-quarters
of the market, in which the prevailing wisdom among information
technology professionals was the aphorism that ``no one ever lost
his job by buying IBM''
</P>
<P>
   How quickly things can change. Today, EMC owns 35 percent of the
market for large external storage systems, compared with a 22
percent share for the market's No. 2 company, IBM, which has now
focused much of its attention on building smaller computer disk
drives rather than the large data storage systems in which EMC
specializes.
</P>
<P>
   How did EMC do this? To begin with, EMC helped convince
customers that the data storage system was no longer a mundane
peripheral to corporate computers but a technological weapon which
the customer could put to strategic business use.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the catalog merchant LL Bean, an EMC customer,
found that it could process transactions sufficiently faster to add
a full day _ and tens of millions of dollars in sales _ to its
holiday shopping season and still promise delivery by Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   EMC's rise came on the wings of its Symmetrix storage systems, a
product line that was introduced in 1990 and that drastically
shifted the technical assumptions about data storage.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than follow IBM's model of writing millions of lines of
complex software microcode to run these refrigerator-size
electronic file cabinets, EMC engineers built storage devices made
up of hundreds of small, off-the-shelf disk drives. The engineers
were able to make these devices work together with a simple bit of
microcode, and the company packaged them as smaller, cheaper,
faster, more powerful and _ as it turned out _ inherently more
reliable storage devices.
</P>
<P>
   That pioneering technology was known as RAID (redundant array of
independent disks). And though it was invented at the University of
California at Berkeley, EMC developed it into a commercially viable
product that processed data faster than conventional storage
devices and took up less floor space, too.
</P>
<P>
   IBM had reaped 70 percent profit margins by selling ``one size
fits all'' systems, much to the chagrin of corporate
information-technology managers, who had long felt hampered by such
limited and restrictive offerings _ and were often hard pressed to
afford the systems, which might sell for $700,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   EMC aimed to address such frustrations, seeking the advice of
corporate computing managers and inviting them to a visitor center
at EMC headquarters, where customers could regularly meet with
engineers, see work in progress and offer suggestions. And to turn
visitors into customers, EMC put the new systems into client sites
at no charge for a few months of testing.
</P>
<P>
   The Unum Corp., a large insurance company, used the free trial
to process its year-end data, an enormous number-crunching effort
that traditionally took two full weeks of computer time. Using
EMC's system, the company completed the task in three days. The
customer was sold.
</P>
<P>
   EMC executives referred to these as ``puppy dog sales.'' Once
the cute puppy was home, few cared to return it to the pet shop. It
didn't hurt that initially at least, EMC's prices tended to be
hundreds of thousands of dollars below IBM's.
</P>
<P>
   And over time, EMC learned to concentrate on the customers that
could implicity help the company market its products. For example,
some 9,000 banks in the United States spend nearly $20 billion each
year on information technology.
</P>
<P>
   EMC knows that the top five _ BankAmerica, Chase Manhattan,
Citigroup, JP Morgan and Banc One _ account for nearly 40 percent
of that spending. All are EMC customers. Winning them has helped
the company turn the other top 25 banks into EMC customers today,
and more of the nation's smaller banks are coming into the EMC fold
each month.
</P>
<P>
   Grab the leaders and the rest generally follow. It's one of the
premises of radical marketing _ the technology marketing model for
the 21st century.

NASDAQ REVIVES PROPOSAL TO TEST TRADING HALTS
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With continued volatility in Internet stocks, Nasdaq
regulators are now moving to temporarily halt trading of the most
wildly unstable shares.
</P>
<P>
   Frank G. Zarb, chairman of Nasdaq's parent, the National
Association of Securities Dealers, has asked the association's
board to consider testing trading halts for one year. A proposal to
institute the use of trading halts was rejected just two weeks ago
by a Nasdaq committee of market makers and brokerage firm officials
that had studied the issue as a possible remedy to large daily
price swings in Internet-related shares.
</P>
<P>
   But in the wake of recent warnings about online trading by the
Securities and Exchange Commission's chairman, Arthur Levitt, and
the disclosure by the New York attorney general, Eliot L. Spitzer,
that he would investigate the Internet trading industry, Zarb will
now ask the association board to consider allowing halts.
</P>
<P>
   Association officials said the plan, which would also require
SEC approval, would allow Nasdaq to halt trading in a stock
immediately ``when there appears to be significant corporate news
or when a company's security is experiencing extraordinary
volatility, either of which is impacting the fairness and
orderliness of the market.''
</P>
<P>
   The enormous level of recent trading activity, Zarb said in a
statement, has created ``new issues of volatility and trading
practices, issues that must be addressed by the exchanges and
member firms to preserve the fairness of the market for
investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates say that trading halts have worked at the New York
Stock Exchange and that they would stem the sharpest price moves of
Internet-related stocks. But opponents contend that halts could
increase volatility by causing investors to rush to make trades
before a halt.
</P>
<P>
   A key issue that has not been resolved is what specific criteria
Nasdaq officials would use before halting trading in a stock, said
Bernard L. Madoff, a leading Nasdaq market maker and head of the
Securities Industry Association trading committee. ``It's something
long overdue, and I think it would be a sensible way to deal with
some of the volatility occurring in the marketplace,'' said Madoff,
who expects that officials of both the association and the SEC will
approve trading halts.
</P>
<P>
   While the idea has been dismissed before, he said, ``I think the
circumstances in the marketplace today are such that there is so
much volatility, and so many small public orders coming in, that it
makes more sense.''

 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF with EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mary Jo Paoni stood contentedly in her front yard, as firmly
planted in Middle America as any of the cornstalks out back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't invest in Asia,'' she said, shaking her head
decisively. A 59-year-old secretary with big, sparkling eyes, a
plaid shirt and no pretensions, she added, ``Investing in Asia
frightens me.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, George, a retired meat cutter, was standing beside
her as the sun set over Cantrall, Ill., a farm town about 130 miles
southwest of Chicago. He was equally adamant. ``If I'm going to
gamble,'' he said, ``I want to sit down with my friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Mrs. Paoni, who has never traveled outside the United
States, is in fact invested in Asia and all over the world,
although she does not know it.
</P>
<P>
   After retiring in April from her job as a secretary with the
state government, she will rely on a pension fund that has large
investments abroad, giving her indirect ownership of stocks in
Indonesia and Russia and Brazil. And the cash she tucked away in an
A.G. Edwards money market account was funneled to big banks, which
helped build elegant hotels and office towers from Argentina to
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Americans have become, like the Paonis, the
unknowing financiers of developing countries, as money swishes
around the world today from Cantrall to Russia to Brazil to China,
connecting the most unlikely people. Among them are Mrs. Paoni and
an Indonesian rickshaw driver named Salamet, a 27-year-old with a
drooping mustache, an angry wife and three hungry children.
</P>
<P>
   For Mrs. Paoni and most Americans, these are still good times
economically. But elsewhere in the world, hundreds of millions of
people like Salamet are still caught in a severe crisis, one that
has recast lives and will haunt a generation in the East just as
the Great Depression shaped a generation in the West.
</P>
<P>
   It is still not clear that the financial upheavals, which began
in Thailand in July 1997, will ever damage the United States. But
the collapse of Brazil's currency in January and the jolt it gave
markets worldwide underscored the continuing risks of ``the most
serious financial crisis in half a century,'' as President Clinton
called it in his State of the Union address.
</P>
<P>
   The worldwide financial crisis over the last 20 months has
toppled some governments and hobbled others. The crisis has turned
Salamet's life upside down without affecting Mrs. Paoni at all _
but it illustrates how globalization increasingly stitches lives
all over the world into a single economic quilt.
</P>
<P>
   In the new economic landscape that has emerged in recent years,
the pool of international investments has grown to dwarf the sums
that governments can muster, and money zips around the globe far
faster than ever before. The result is a world more prosperous, but
also perhaps more wobbly.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more people are asking whether the international
financial system as it has operated for most of the 1990s is
basically unstable,'' Ian McFarlane, governor of Australia's
central bank, said at a recent conference in Singapore. ``And I
think by now the majority of observers have come to the conclusion
that it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Salamet, the Rickshaw Man
</P>
<P>
   Salamet, a burly man with an expression as hard as his biceps,
knows nothing of finance, but he understands that his world is
falling apart.
</P>
<P>
   As he sat on the porch of his little white house in a remote
corner of Indonesia, his thoughts were on his mother. He sat
brooding, his stomach tying itself in knots, as his mother's gasps
filtered through the curtain from the next room.
</P>
<P>
   She was lying on the floor, dying of cancer, a huge tumor
growing inside her breast. What gnawed at Salamet each waking
moment was not just her gasps but also his guilt at the knowledge
that he could help her but had decided not to.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor had prescribed a painkiller costing $2 a month, a sum
that Salamet earns in two days and could afford. But as his wife,
Yuti, reminded him sharply, if he were to buy the painkiller, he
would get further behind in making payments on his rickshaw,
meaning that it might be seized and he would lose his livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   Or he would have to stop paying school fees, meaning that his
son Dwi might be forced to leave the second grade and never get an
education.
</P>
<P>
   Although Salamet has always been poor, the financial crisis has
deepened the desperation in his home and countless others. Indeed,
if Dwi drops out, he will have plenty of company: The Asian
Development Bank estimates that 6.1 million children have left
school in Indonesia in recent months because of the economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Salamet contemplated his options as he sat, stony-faced, beneath
the mango trees of Mojokerto, a midsized town 400 miles east of the
Indonesian capital, Jakarta. He is quiet by nature, and when his
wife scolds him for not earning enough money, he does not shout at
her or hit her, as other men in the neighborhood might.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead, he just sulks,'' said Mrs. Yuti, a slim woman with
high cheekbones; an embarrassed grin spread across her face and was
mimicked by the baby she was carrying in her arms.
</P>
<P>
   Salamet, who like his wife and many other Indonesians uses only
one name, pondered the bleak options in a flat voice, weighing what
flexibility he might have. Would the school really expel Dwi if he
got further behind on the school fees? How long could he delay
payments before the rickshaw would be seized? How little pain
reliever could he get away with giving his mother to ease the worst
of her agony?
</P>
<P>
   Tired of this calculus, he shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it were like before and I had money,'' he growled, ``of
course I would buy her more painkillers. But now I can't spare the
cash for her.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   From Speculation to Crisis
</P>
<P>
   The initial impulse in the United States as the crisis erupted
was to see the problems as an outgrowth of Asian corruption and
cronyism. These probably made the situation worse, but a growing
body of evidence suggests that there was nothing uniquely Asian
about these countries' problems, and that the catastrophe was
worsened by folly and hubris in the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   It was bankers and investors in Moscow and the Thai capital,
Bangkok, who speculated wildly on stocks and real estate and thus
built up catastrophic bubble economies. But it was U.S. officials
who pushed for the financial liberalization that nurtured the
speculation (even if developing nations themselves welcomed it).
</P>
<P>
   And it was U.S. bankers and money managers who poured billions
of dollars into those emerging markets. Then, when the crisis hit,
U.S. officials insisted on tough measures like budget cuts and high
interest rates, which many economists argue made things worse.
</P>
<P>
   The failure in January of the $41.5 billion bailout of Brazil
demonstrates that the West still has not found a reliable formula
for dealing with these crises. Experts continue to worry about the
danger of a global recession or worse, and about the risk that
economic woes may tear apart countries like Indonesia and even
China.
</P>
<P>
   Resentment at U.S. policies _ and perhaps at the United States'
economic success _ has also led to a sense in many countries that
the global economy is at an ideological turning point. In
particular, there is a growing backlash against what some nations
regard as an American model of laissez-faire capitalism, which
rescues Connecticut hedge funds but sacrifices Indonesian children.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly in Tokyo and Paris, where markets have always been
regarded as something like ornery oxen _ best when firmly yoked and
even then prone to leave messes _ there is talk of sturdier
harnesses to guide capital flows, speculators and markets
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   What does all this portend? And how can it be that, as David
Hale, chief economist of the Zurich Group, describes the financial
upheaval of the last year and a half, ``a real-estate crisis in
Bangkok set in motion something that has no parallel in human
history''?
</P>
<P>
   Early Gains for Salamet
</P>
<P>
   The saga begins in places like Salamet's riverside neighborhood
in Indonesia, then a poor country that had not yet taken on the
glitter of an emerging market.
</P>
<P>
   For countless generations, Salamet's ancestors have been
agricultural laborers, owning little or no land, struggling to
survive and often not even managing that. When Salamet was 10, his
father fell to his death from a palm tree he was pruning.
</P>
<P>
   Salamet's mother remarried, and the boy and his new stepfather
labored side by side each day, lugging sacks of sand from
riverbanks to sell to cement factories. It was backbreaking work,
but it was accompanied by breathtaking progress.
</P>
<P>
   As foreign investments poured into Indonesia, the town of
Mojokerto thrived in the general prosperity. Salamet and his
stepfather, Pirso, rented rickshaws and began driving them _ a
business that boomed as people made a bit more, and as mud paths
were paved to make rickshaw travel feasible.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesian families are usually close-knit, and Pirso sent some
of the money to help his own mother, Mariyam, in the town of Kediri
several hours' drive to the south.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mariyam, a thin and energetic gray-haired woman, was
sitting one day recently in her store-bought wooden chair, beside
her nicely finished bureau, on which rested a black Deluxe All
Transistor Radio that in English pledged INSTANT SUPERB SOUND.
</P>
<P>
   The floor was concrete, the roof was tile, the walls were
covered with tattered wallpaper, and a curtain covered the bedroom
next door. It had become a genuine house, no longer a hut, and
outside was a pump and outhouse-cum-bath built five years ago by
Pirso.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big improvement,'' she said, ``because the river was
far away. And it's nice, because I can bathe without everybody
seeing. It's supposed to be that if you're bathing in the river,
people stay away. But some of the men are naughty.''
</P>
<P>
   These gains over the years have been enormous, and so far they
have proved reasonably durable. The deprivation and hunger are
serious, but as yet there is little evidence that the financial
crisis has sent Asia 20 or 30 years backward or that it has
destroyed the middle class.
</P>
<P>
   Third World Is Renamed
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, Mrs. Paoni's savings would have stayed far from
any place where people have to bathe in rivers. Her money would
have remained where she still thinks it is, entirely in nice and
safe American communities like hers. Mrs. Paoni and her husband
have invested in stocks, but they say they have stuck to blue chips
like Coca Cola and Disney.
</P>
<P>
   She wants security above all. Risk is acceptable when confined
to her Mary Higgins Clark mysteries and Stephen King horror novels,
but she is counting on safe investments and her pension income when
she and her husband pull up stakes this year and move, perhaps to
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Income in retirement will come from the Illinois state pension
fund, which like most pension funds has the same deeply
conservative instincts as Mrs. Paoni.
</P>
<P>
   But even that is slowly changing, as fund managers seek higher
returns. In 1980 less than 1 percent of pension-fund assets in the
United States was invested abroad, but by 1997 that figure had
risen to 17 percent. And so, as part of the process bandied about
as ``globalization,'' Mrs. Paoni has tiny financial stakes in
dozens of countries around the world.
</P>
<P>
   One reason Americans like her and her pension-fund managers used
to be unwilling to invest in places like Indonesia was the
description ``Third World markets,'' which had an ominous ring. In
the mid-1980s the International Finance Corp. of the World Bank was
trying to drum up support for a Third World investment fund, when
one listener complained about the terminology.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wants to put money into the Third World investment
fund,'' the man protested. ``You'd better come up with something
better.''
</P>
<P>
   So in just a few days officials dreamed up an alternative _
``emerging markets'' _ and it proved a winner. The first
emerging-markets fund came out in 1986, and the craze was born.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Emerging markets quickly produced emerging gurus. One of the
most prominent is Mark Mobius, 62, who is instantly recognizable at
investment conferences with his shaven head and stern, lean look.
</P>
<P>
   Templeton Funds recruited Mobius in 1987 to figure out the small
markets of the world, and under him the Templeton Emerging Markets
Fund was a success almost immediately. In 1988 the fund gained 37
percent, and then it soared 98 percent in 1989. After a small dip
in 1990, it rocketed 112 percent in 1991 and after another dip
soared 100 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 1987 crash was very bad for emerging markets,'' Mobius
said. ``But in 1988-89 the recovery came, and the ball started
rolling as people started waking up to the tremendous returns that
were possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The bullishness was, in part, self-fulfilling. The stock markets
in small countries were tiny, and modest investments by Westerners
tended to bid up prices, thus attracting more investors.
</P>
<P>
   The result was that hubris increased more rapidly than the
caliber of most investment research. Bright young men and women who
could barely read a spreadsheet moved to Asia and ended up getting
hired as research analysts by investment banks. They sometimes made
hundreds of thousands of dollars a year picking stocks in countries
whose languages they could barely speak.
</P>
<P>
   The Capital Starts to Flow
</P>
<P>
   Even more than pension funds and mutual funds and other stock
purchasers, banks were piling into emerging markets _ particularly
banks from Europe and Japan. Investors bought $50 billion worth of
stocks and bonds in emerging markets in 1996, but that year
international banks poured $76 billion into those countries.
</P>
<P>
   From Mrs. Paoni's money market account at A.G. Edwards, the
American brokerage company, cash flows to major U.S. banks, like
J.P. Morgan and Chase Manhattan. There is no risk to Mrs. Paoni,
but from the big banks some portion of her savings journeys abroad.
</P>
<P>
   All this capital made a spectacular difference to
emerging-market countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``When history books are written 200 years from now about the
last two decades of the 20th century,'' Deputy Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers said recently, ``I am convinced that the end of
the Cold War will be the second story. The first story will be
about the appearance of emerging markets _ about the fact that
developing countries where more than 3 billion people live have
moved toward the market and seen rapid growth in incomes.''
</P>
<P>
   Countries like Chile, Egypt, Russia and Vietnam became enmeshed
in the international economy. In Moscow, tycoons dripping with gold
and diamonds began to drop hundreds of dollars at trendy new
restaurants, and in the early 1990s more Mercedes 600 SEL sedans
were selling in Moscow, at $130,000 apiece, than in New York City.
In the Russian city of Volgograd, one wealthy citizen plunked down
$300,000 to buy two stretch limousines.
</P>
<P>
   In Brazil's biggest city, Sao Paulo, homeless children slept
under billboard advertisements for mutual funds, and farther south,
in Argentina, cash machines spat out U.S. dollars and televisions
offered 50 cable channels.
</P>
<P>
   And in the ancient Chinese lakeside city of Hangzhou, two
``dakuan,'' or fat cats, got into a contest to see who was
wealthier. They began burning real currency to show off, and in a
blink they had each burned $400.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, today's crisis fits neatly into a long history of
financial manias and panics. Emerging markets have been risky ever
since the 1320s, when England, then a developing country, defaulted
on loans to banks in the Italian city-state of Genoa. In the 19th
century, states like Mississippi defaulted on debts just as Russia
did last year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the parallels with the past, new elements are at
work to make the global economy very different from that of a
century ago, or even a decade ago. Most fundamentally, finance and
technology have exploded in importance and now dominate the
economic horizon.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical day, the total amount of money changing hands in
the world's foreign exchange markets alone is $1.5 trillion _ an
eightfold increase since 1986 and an almost incomprehensible sum,
equivalent to total world trade for four months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no longer the real economy driving the financial
markets,'' said Marc Faber, a prominent fund manager in Hong Kong,
``but the financial markets driving the real economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, a 15 percent increase in U.S. stock prices bolsters
American wealth by $1.7 trillion, which is considerably more than
the value of all the manufacturing that takes place in a year in
the entire United States. This capacity for wealth creation has
delighted Americans, but there is also a converse: A 15 percent
drop in the market erases wealth equivalent to the entire annual
output of all U.S. factories.
</P>
<P>
   Economists are still charting this new global economic
landscape, but they point out some of its features:
</P>
<P>
   _ The amount of investment capital has exploded. By 1995, mutual
funds, pension funds and other institutional investors controlled
$20 trillion, 10 times the figure of 1980. The global economy is no
longer dominated by trade in cars and steel and wheat, but rather
by trade in stocks, bonds and currencies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Far more wealth than ever before is stateless, circulating
wherever in the world the owner can find the highest return. Thus
spending by investors in industrialized countries on overseas
stocks increased 197-fold between 1970 and 1997, and each nation's
capital market is beginning to merge into a global capital market.
</P>
<P>
   _ New technologies have vastly reduced the importance of
physical distance. In 1930 a three-minute telephone call from New
York to London cost $245. Now it runs 36 cents. In cyberspace,
every market is next door.
</P>
<P>
   _ Investments are increasingly leveraged, using borrowed money
so that a $1 million bet becomes a $5 million bet, or they are
channeled through complex financial instruments known as
derivatives to multiply the potential profits. Derivatives have
grown exponentially, with those traded in 1997 valued at $360
trillion, a figure equivalent to a dozen times the size of the
entire global economy, and they bring important benefits but also
new risks of turbulence.
</P>
<P>
   _ Public funds are increasingly used to bail out losers, like
banks. The latest crisis has forced an international rescue on a
scale like nothing before, with roughly $175 billion in public
money raised so far for the various international bailouts. At
least some of that public money has gone to rescue bankers and
politicians from their own mistakes.

<HEADLINE>
A TEST OF HONG KONG'S AUTONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Late last month Hong Kong's final court of appeal made a
landmark decision. It ruled that children of Hong Kong residents
could legally live in Hong Kong and did not require Beijing's
permission to do so.
</P>
<P>
   It was without doubt the single most important affirmation of
Hong Kong's legal autonomy since ``one country, two systems'' came
into effect with the turnover to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was important not so much for what it said about
immigration and residency rights in the former colony but because
it in effect overruled the National People's Congress on the
subject, affirming the independence of Hong Kong's judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   An independent judiciary is the touchstone of Deng Xiaoping's
``one country, two systems,'' for without it there would be only
one system. An independent judiciary is also not a concept that
Chinese officials are comfortable with, though they are making baby
steps in that direction, because an independent court system means
that there is a higher authority than the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   This week there have been rumblings out of China that Hong
Kong's courts must be brought to heel. ``This is a very serious
matter,'' said Zhao Qizheng, a minister of information for the
Chinese Cabinet. ``The decision needs to be changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Beijing's Law Daily, an official publication, quoted Xiao Yang,
president of the Supreme People's Court of China, as saying that
``courts of all levels throughout the country must strengthen their
contact with the people's delegates'' to the National People's
Congress ``and actively accept the supervision of the NPC.'' In
other words, in China the party's wishes should be the law.
</P>
<P>
   It is up to Hong Kong to remain firm on this matter. If the Hong
Kong courts can be intimidated and overruled by the party bosses in
Beijing, then the carefully constructed local autonomy that is
supposed to guide Hong Kong for the next 50 years will be rendered
a fraud.

 UNDATED: own mistakes.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For all the dazzling size and complexity of the global financial
markets, it is not clear that the markets are operating with an
intelligence that matches their scale. There may be computer
equipment analyzing blips in exchange rates, but investors are
fundamentally prey to emotions and panics and tend to overshoot.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Samuelson, the Nobel laureate in economics, argues that
sophisticated analysis has done a marvelous job in achieving
``microefficiency'' in financial markets. The result is that share
prices adjust almost perfectly to specific news like currency
movements or changes in dividends.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I also believe the evidence is overwhelming that there is
no macroefficiency of speculative markets,'' Samuelson added.
``They experience self-fulfilling swings, and they can swing far
above and below any kind of sensible fundamental value. There does
not exist an efficiency which is self-correcting, except in the
case that every bubble will someday burst.''
</P>
<P>
   Investment Analysts Predict
</P>
<P>
   How do these speculative swings come about?
</P>
<P>
   Part of the answer is changes in market sentiment because of
pronouncements by people like Barton Biggs. One of the gray-haired
elders of Wall Street, Biggs, 65, the chief global investment
strategist for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co., commands the
attention of pension fund managers in Illinois and around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   In an industry that has drifted toward computer models and
number crunchers, Biggs is a generalist who is famous for his
brilliantly written investment reports, which are often funny and
always influential.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, in typical seat-of-the-pants style, he made a weeklong
trip to China and came out starry-eyed. He urged investors to
increase their holdings of Hong Kong stocks sixfold, to 7 percent
of a global stock portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all stunned by the enormous size of China,'' he
declared. ``Sometimes you have to spend time in a country to get
really focused on the investment case. After eight days in China,
I'm tuned in, overfed and maximum bullish.''
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong stocks soared at those words, and gained 28 percent
over the next seven weeks. Then, in August 1994, Biggs declared
that the smaller Asian markets _ Thailand, Indonesia and Hong Kong
_ would be ``the best place in the world to be for the next five
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Biggs' comments were representative of Wall Street's euphoria
about Asia. When executives of an obscure Indonesian polyester
company called Polysindo visited New York in 1996 to discuss
issuing bonds, they were squired around and accorded meetings with
top executives at Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. No comparable
Chicago company could ever have got such a welcome.
</P>
<P>
   American investment banks were so eager to arrange stock
offerings for the likes of Polysindo that they often charged Asian
companies about 3 percent of the value of the deal, compared with 6
percent that they would charge companies in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   This reflected the ease with which some foreign companies could
raise money, and the head of a U.S. corporation plaintively queried
a New York investment bank, ``Why do I have to pay 6 percent when
you charge an Indonesian company only 3 percent?''
</P>
<P>
   At Templeton, Mobius was more careful in his pronouncements than
many other analysts, emphasizing that emerging markets can go down
as well as up. But his moderation was taken as simply a token of
his modesty, and he was rapidly becoming a celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   An investment of $10,000 in the fund at the beginning of 1988
would have turned into $100,000 by the end of 1993, and Templeton
began to use his picture in its advertisements. His shaven head
smiled out at investors, and he came to symbolize the truly global
fund manager.
</P>
<P>
   Mobius speaks at least a bit of six foreign languages _ Chinese,
Korean, Japanese, German, Spanish and Thai _ and he comes across as
a citizen of the world. In 1992 he dropped his American nationality
for German citizenship, for tax reasons, and he spends most of his
time in hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Nominally a resident of Singapore, with a second home in the
Philippines, he travels 250 days a year, roaming Asia, Latin
America and Eastern Europe. In a typical week he might visit four
cities and 20 companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to go out and find bargains,'' he said at an
investment conference in Chicago. ``You can't find bargains sitting
at a desk reading annual reports.''
</P>
<P>
   A Hedge Fund Starts Selling
</P>
<P>
   On March 8, 1996, the first shot was fired at the emerging
markets. A New York hedge fund sold $400 million worth of the Thai
currency, the baht, betting that it would fall.
</P>
<P>
   Hedge funds, famous for secrecy, are large pools of speculative
funds that make investments for banks, pension funds or other large
investors. The first hedge fund was founded in 1949, but they came
into their own only in the 1990s, with their assets soaring
twelvefold between 1990 and 1997. Now there are 3,500 hedge funds,
managing $200 billion. _ And they are able to leverage that,
through borrowing, into a much greater sum.
</P>
<P>
   The baht was pegged to the dollar so that they rose and fell
together, and the peg was frequently praised as a source of
stability for the Thai economy. But the hedge-fund managers were
shrewd enough to see that Thailand's economy was faltering, its
exports slowing, its property sector sagging and its banks sinking
under bad loans.
</P>
<P>
   The baht should have weakened along with Thailand's economy, but
instead the peg kept it as strong as the dollar. The hedge-fund
managers sensed that the baht was too strong considering Thailand's
weaknesses, and they knew that if Thailand's slowing economy forced
the government to float the currency, they could make a quick
killing.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, though, that first hedge fund's bet against the
baht fizzled, and a few days later the fund gave up.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts continued to rave about Asia. At Morgan Stanley,
Biggs had been wrong when he predicted that stock markets in
Thailand would soar in 1996 (instead, Thai stocks fell 36 percent),
and so in January 1997 he went on what he called a fact-finding
mission, ``to clarify my thinking on the Thai stock market.''
</P>
<P>
   The facts that Biggs found were, on the whole, positive ones. He
said at a Morgan Stanley investment seminar in Tokyo on Jan. 14,
1997, as recorded by Bloomberg News Service: ``We tend to think
there are a lot of opportunities in Asian emerging markets,'' and
he specifically referred to Thailand, South Korea, India and
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a market that is down 50 percent,'' Biggs told
the investors, ``you have to be looking for values. We can find
values for Thailand.''
</P>
<P>
   Others could not. From that date through the end of 1997, Thai
stock prices fell 75.3 percent in dollar terms.

   Tracking Capital Flight
</P>
<P>
   In judging countries like Thailand, bankers and investors rely
partly on expert assessments from credit-rating institutions like
Standard &AMP; Poors and Moody's Investors Services. So what was S&AMP;P
saying?
</P>
<P>
   ``Standard &AMP; Poors does not expect that the likely scale of
financial-sector losses will seriously impair the kingdom's credit
standing,'' S&AMP;P said about Thailand on March 18, 1997. It added
that any crisis in Thailand was ``most unlikely'' to approach the
levels of the problems in Mexico in 1995 or Indonesia or Finland in
the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   If S&AMP;P's prediction was off base, that might not have been so
unusual. Scholarly analyses find that the rating agencies usually
offer warnings only when it is too late. For example, a study by
two American economists, Carmen Reinhart and Morris Goldstein,
looked at 72 financial crises around the world since 1979 and
concluded that rating agencies tended to react after crises instead
of anticipating them.
</P>
<P>
   S&AMP;P sees things differently. John Chambers, one of its managing
directors, said that his company's analysis had been thorough and
had identified potential risks.
</P>
<P>
   For all the scorn heaped on Asians for their cronyism and other
foolishness, local people in Thailand, Malaysia, Russia and South
Korea were showing the most savvy. They were selling _ usually to
the kind of enthusiastic, well-trained foreigners who were making
many times their salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Capital flight is hard to track precisely, but it is the main
reason for the ``errors and omissions'' line in the International
Monetary Fund data. These data show that there was no significant
capital flight from emerging markets between 1990 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Capital flight soared to $16 billion in 1996, a full year before
the crisis began, and reached $45 billion in 1997. This money then
ended up in major banks based in Switzerland, London and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Drenched in a `Blood Baht'
</P>
<P>
   Japan, the dominant economy in Asia and the one that might have
been the locomotive to pull countries like Thailand out of their
difficulties, instead administered the coup de grace. On April 1,
1997, against the strenuous protests of Summers, who flew to Tokyo
to deliver a testy complaint from Washington, Japan raised its
sales tax to 5 percent from 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Summers had insisted that this would harm Japan's incipient
economic recovery by dampening consumer spending, but Japanese
officials scoffed at that argument. Eisuke Sakakibara, Japan's
deputy minister of finance for international affairs, was
particularly emphatic that Japan was doing just fine. He told
reporters that those who denied Japan's being on a recovery course
were irrational.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am an optimist on the Japanese economy,'' he said in May
1997, adding a month later, ``Real growth in Japan's gross domestic
product will exceed the government's projection.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was Summers who was proved right. In the second quarter
of 1997, Japanese economic output was actually plunging at an
annual rate of 11 percent. Japan became mired in its worst
recession in six decades, and instead of dealing decisively with
its troubles, it steadily sank deeper. Japan's imports from Asian
countries like Thailand slumped.
</P>
<P>
   With Thai exporters now struggling, along with property
developers and hotel companies, the entire country became edgy. The
overvalued currency resulted in alarming trade deficits, and
speculation grew that the peg would be broken and the baht
devalued.
</P>
<P>
   Thailand's own investors and companies began buying dollars, and
this attracted the attention of foreign speculators. In May, Tiger
Management, based in New York and one of the biggest hedge funds of
all, began to bet heavily against the baht, and other banks and
hedge funds piled on as well.
</P>
<P>
   It looked as if the speculators would win. Normally baht-dollar
trades totaled $200 million a day, but the amounts now soared. On
May 13, 1997, the Thai central bank sold $6.3 billion to buy baht
that everyone else was selling. A central banker wrote that day in
a sober memo to his bosses, ``The market was not afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, officials met in the central bank to try to figure
out what to do. There was fury at hedge funds, but most of all
there was utter desperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone panicked, and some even cried,'' Rerngchai
Marakanond, the head of the central bank, recalled later before a
government commission.
</P>
<P>
   If Thailand had decided on that day to give up and devalue the
baht, while it still had reserves left, the world might have been
able to avoid the worst of the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Thailand would have faced a severe domestic banking crisis and
property glut, and other countries would also have faced slumps.
But the country would have saved its reserves and perhaps avoided a
severe panic, and the fury of the crisis and the impact on nations
as far away as Brazil and Russia might have been minimized.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting went the other way, with the central bank now
determined to risk everything in a battle against speculators. That
day the central bank intervened again, selling more than $10
billion. It was one of the biggest interventions any central bank
had ever made, but it had little impact.
</P>
<P>
   The Thai central bankers had one more trick up their sleeves. On
May 15, 1997, they sold dollars and simultaneously ordered banks
not to lend to foreign speculators. The speculators were unable to
unwind their bets as their losses mounted, and they screamed into
their phones, threw chairs across the room and watched their
computer screens in horror.
</P>
<P>
   In one day, the hedge funds lost around $450 million, according
to Callum Henderson, a currency analyst who wrote a book about the
crisis. That day became known among traders as the ``blood baht.''

 UNDATED: ``blood baht.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thailand's prime minister telephoned the central bank to
congratulate officials and promise a celebration party, but it was
a Pyrrhic victory. The central bank had supported the baht by
selling dollars in forward contracts, committing itself to using
its dollars to buy baht in the future.
</P>
<P>
   In practical terms, this meant that its official reserves of $30
billion were mostly already pledged and no longer usable to defend
the baht. And speculators continued the attack, carefully but
constantly keeping up the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Who were these speculators? They were mostly American, and the
hedge funds were prominent among them. But they also included major
U.S. banks, trading for themselves to make a profit. Mrs. Paoni
could not have known it, but a tiny fraction of her savings might
have been thrown, by a circuitous route, into the attack on the
baht.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the funds in Mrs. Paoni's money market account, for
example, went to J.P. Morgan, and J.P. Morgan said in a court
document that it had traded $1 billion worth of baht in the fall of
1996. The bank did not disclose its trades in the spring of 1997,
and bank officials refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Thai officials were furious that U.S. hedge funds and banks were
investing billions of dollars in a bid to destabilize their
country, and they worried about the consequences of such
speculative battles on all of Asia. In May 1997 Rerngchai, the
central bank chief, sent a secret letter of complaint to Alan
Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, urging him to
rein in U.S. hedge funds and other financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Rerngchai warned that the attack on Thailand ``could have
far-reaching implications on the economy both of Thailand and the
Asian region'' and ``threatens to jeopardize the stability of
international financial markets.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar letter was sent to Hans Tietmeyer, the president of
Germany's central bank, noting that one German bank had joined in
the attack on the baht. Tietmeyer quickly responded himself, a Thai
official recalled, with a question of his own: Which of our banks?
That warmed hearts at the Thai central bank, but the response from
Washington annoyed them.
</P>
<P>
   The correspondence, made available by a Thai central bank
official and confirmed by another government official, shows that
the Fed's response came not from Greenspan but from an aide, Edwin
Truman. He blandly acknowledged that ``large financial firms'' can
disrupt markets of countries like Thailand but added that these
matters were best left to the markets.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan declined to comment. ``All communications with other
central banks are private,'' said Lynn Fox, spokeswoman for the
Federal Reserve in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   There was another opportunity for the leading countries to
confront the problems before the crisis erupted. In late June, the
seven leading industrialized nations held their summit meeting in
Denver, and aides say that in the confidential discussion among
leaders, the Japanese prime minister at the time, Ryutaro
Hashimoto, called for the industrial countries to discuss the
financial instability in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese officials were expectant, waiting for President Clinton
and other leaders to take up the matter. But according to one U.S.
official who was there, Hashimoto was typically understated,
tentative and vague (as is considered polite in Japan), and did not
call for any specific action.
</P>
<P>
   So President Clinton and the other world leaders paid no
attention.
</P>
<P>
   The View From Ground Zero
</P>
<P>
   Thanong Bidaya, one of Thailand's most respected bankers, is an
imposing man with a round face, a gentle manner and a passion for
collecting antique watches. A fluent speaker of both English and
Japanese, he flew to Hong Kong for a weekend in June 1997 with his
wife, planning to scour the shops for old watches. He settled into
a hotel in the Tsim Sha Tsui district, and the phone rang. It was
Thailand's prime minister, asking him to take over as finance
minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've found no one, I'll do it for you,'' Thanong agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he recalled thinking, ``The situation can't be that
serious.'' So the next day Thanong flew back to Bangkok. And then,
on the evening of June 27, 1997, he climbed into a navy blue
Mercedes-Benz limousine and zigzagged through throngs of traffic to
the central bank headquarters. He wanted to meet Rerngchai, an old
friend from the time they had both studied in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   As Thanong's car approached the stately gates to the majestic
eight-story central bank building, a guard waved it through. It was
about 7 p.m. when they entered a conference room, and Rerngchai
gave his friend the shock of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Thailand was out of cash, Rerngchai explained. After subtracting
the dollars that had been committed in forward transactions,
Thailand had just $2.8 billion in usable foreign-exchange reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he was finance minister and one of his country's
most experienced bankers, Thanong was stunned. Rerngchai had
brought reams of studies examining the options, but he and Thanong
both knew that it was all over.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign banks and hedge funds had won, and Thailand had
lost. The two men agreed that since Thailand had run out of money,
it would have to drop the peg with the dollar and let the baht
float at whatever rate the market set. It was a foreshadowing of
what would happen in Brazil 18 months later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I didn't see any choice in dealing with the
situation,'' Thanong recalled.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, on July 1, the Thai prime minister, Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh, declared that the baht would never be devalued. But
that night, if anybody had noticed, the lights burned brightly at
the central bank. Officials stayed up all night, first calling
major central banks abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at 4:30 a.m., central bankers called the homes of the
heads of all Thai banks and major foreign banks in Bangkok,
summoning them to an emergency meeting that would begin at 6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   When the bleary-eyed bank executives had taken their seats, an
official grimly announced that Thailand could no longer stand
behind the baht. Instead of being pegged to the dollar, it would
float freely.
</P>
<P>
   The global crisis had just detonated.

STINKY OLYMPIC TRAIL LEADS TO L.A.
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It took a little shuffling, but the IOC-Salt Lake
City bribery paper trail finally came up with a Los Angeles link in
its marathon inquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Or, in this case, they found a !ital!clink , like the sound an
aluminum bat makes as it spanks a poor cowhide baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, the Washington Post reported that Jim Easton ,
the IOC member from Van Nuys who, in addition to his bat plant in
the Valley, owns a technical products company in Salt Lake City,
hired the son of an IOC guy from Swaziland six weeks before the
Utah city was picked in 1995 to host the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   You know those Swazis have a knack for improving athletic
equipment technology. Just look at . . . oh, never mind.
</P>
<P>
   That IOC fellow, David Sibandze , has since resigned after
charges he received $111,000 in scholarship and living expenses for
his kid, Sibo .
</P>
<P>
   Easton told the Chicago Tribune he didn't know about the hiring
until two months later and he never met the IOC member before Sibo
was hired. Easton knows he'll take flak for this, but his
willingness to stand behind what he did is because ``I don't think
it was unethical or improper.''
</P>
<P>
   Which all could be entirely true.
</P>
<P>
   But now little Sibo is in the middle of this mess, and the
lynch-mob mentality continues, and sponsors will start pulling back
their $50 million investments to use those Olympic-ring logos on
their letterhead, and Juan Antonio Samaranch will stay in office .
. .
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't you think it's bad enough already for Easton that more
and more college baseball teams are going back to wood? . . .
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the NFL fan in Salt Lake City who's been ordered by
the state Supreme Court to remove her license plates because they
might offend ``reasonable people,'' according to the Salt Lake
Tribune. The plates read ``REDSKIN.'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   A bunch of golf writers tried to prod former L.A. Olympic
Organizing Committee head man Peter Ueberroth for a comment on the
IOC mess when he was playing in the Pebble Beach Pro-Am two weeks
ago. Ueberroth wouldn't bite. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The vote for the 2006 Winter Games comes up in June. Who's got
the best shiny trinkets? . . .
</P>
<P>
   And it's so nice to see Nancy Kerrigan 's career brought to its
knees _ she's Sandy in ``Grease on Ice,'' coming soon to an empty
arena near you. . . .
</P>
<P>
   At the NFL meetings in Atlanta on Tuesday, the owners will talk
amongst themselves about the Houston and L.A. franchise bids _
without any more dog-and-phony shows from the groups. Sounds way
too fishy. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Over and under on Trevor Hoffman 's save opportunities this
season: Four. It'll drop to two if Garth Brooks actually makes the
travelin' squad. . . .
</P>
<P>
   And yes, we smuggle Playboy under the covers to read the
articles. Like the one by Keith Olbermann in the March issue where
he gets off on a rant about how baseball has nothing left to market
since Mark McGwire blew up the home-run record. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Olbermann forgets one thing: Stuffed animals filled with beans.
Because of 'em, the Dodgers have practically guaranteed sellouts
for their first seven games.
</P>
<P>
   After Opening Day ( Kevin Brown vs. Arizona's Randy Johnson ),
the Dodgers have six different beanie-bear-like giveaways for the
lucky 14-and-under age range _ with customized tags on them to show
they came exclusively from Dodger Stadium. The
otherwise-nondescript bears are named after Mark McGwire, Sammy
Sosa, Roger Maris, Babe Ruth, Ken Griffey Jr. and
</P>
<P>
   Hank Aaron , which will be given out on April 8, the 25th
anniversary of his 715th home run.
</P>
<P>
   There's no Al Downing bear to go with it? He could be named
``Boo Boo.'' . . . &QL;

AMONG PILOTS, A LONG HISTORY OF DEEP DISTRUST
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Texas, Colo., Ill.)  (Duplication notice: Also moving `a' category code.)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A senior pilot at American Airlines works about 14 days a month
and can earn more than $200,000 a year. Forced by federal law to
retire at age 60, that pilot receives a lifelong pension and a
lump-sum payment that in some recent cases has reached $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Yet hundreds of American pilots called in sick last week to vent
their rage at the airline's management, forcing the cancellation of
thousands of flights and inconveniencing hundreds of thousands of
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Their anger was not unusual. In September, striking pilots
grounded Northwest Airlines for nearly three weeks. And pilots at
Federal Express threatened for a time to disrupt the peak Christmas
delivery season.
</P>
<P>
   So why are some of America's best-paid and most highly respected
workers among its most militant? Some answers can be found in the
pilots' central role in the airline industry and in past labor
conflicts that have left the pilots with a deep distrust of
management.
</P>
<P>
   But it is just as important to look at the character traits of
the pilots themselves. Members of a highly skilled elite, pilots
both individually and as a group often exhibit a self-confidence
that some industry executives say borders on arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really think that they are at the center of the
universe,'' said an executive at a major airline who regularly
negotiates with the pilots and therefore insisted on anonymity.
``They are people who are trained to think in terms of right and
wrong. They are not trained to tolerate ambiguity.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of American's pilots returned to work Sunday after a
federal judge cited their union for contempt on Saturday for
disobeying his order to end the sickout and ordered the union to
set aside $10 million to pay for damages. American was forced to
cancel fewer flights Sunday and the disruption appeared to subside
at many major airports.
</P>
<P>
   But the union and the airline, which plan to hold a negotiating
session Monday, are still far from reaching a settlement over the
main issue in the dispute: how American will integrate Reno Air, a
small airline it bought in December to expand its presence in the
West. Some pilots said the airline's operations were likely to
continue to suffer because many pilots would strictly adhere to
work rules by refusing to fly overtime until an agreement was
reached.
</P>
<P>
   In his scathing ruling, U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall in
Dallas trivialized the pilots' differences with management and
called the sickout a ``shakedown'' worthy of organized crime. But
while the judge found the union responsible for the damage to
American and its passengers _ and seemed determined to make them
pay for it _ the pilots and their defenders saw things very
differently.
</P>
<P>
   To the pilots, American's handling of the Reno Air purchase was
the latest in a series of deceitful moves by the company designed
to squeeze more work out of them and erode their job security. They
accuse the airline of violating the fundamental protection in their
contract that guarantees that all flying at American will be done
by members of their union, the Allied Pilots Association.
</P>
<P>
   The 300 pilots at Reno Air, which has 25 planes, are represented
by the rival Air Line Pilots Association and earn much less than
their counterparts at American.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great job and I love it, but I don't want it to become
a bad job,'' said one American pilot who enthusiastically
participated in the sickout and spoke on the condition that he not
be identified. ``If we don't hold the line here on the heart of our
contract, then we will travel down a slippery slope.''
</P>
<P>
   Antipathy between pilots and airline management is almost as old
as commercial aviation itself. The first pilots strike was in 1932,
a year after the Air Line Pilots Association was founded. The
union, which is the industry's largest, now has 52,000 members at
51 airlines and is one of the richest and most powerful members of
the AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   In those early years, flying was much more dangerous than it is
today. Pilots resented that airline owners forced them to fly too
many hours, often in foul weather. ``They felt these people were
making money exploiting them,'' said George Hopkins, a professor at
Western Illinois University who has written two books on the
history of pilots unions. ``They saw these people as little more
than profiteers.''
</P>
<P>
   That attitude has not changed much.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the pilots themselves have never been an easy
group for airline executives, or anyone else, to deal with. Many
learn to fly in the military, where even early in their careers
they are part of an elite corps. By the time they are given the
controls of a commercial jet worth $30 million to $170 million and
the responsibility for the lives of hundreds of passengers, many
have developed outsized egos, their critics say.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you gave the company to them to run,'' said Michael Boyd,
an aviation consultant in Evergreen, Colo., whose father was a
captain at American, ``they would say, `I can't run it with this
amount of money. Give me more.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And to a large degree, their exalted status is reinforced by the
traveling public. One major airline recently did a survey on public
attitudes toward pilot pay and found that most people were not
offended that airline pilots were making $200,000 a year. Those
surveyed felt that pilots, like heart surgeons, should be well
compensated because they wanted to see those professions attract
the most competent people.

</P>
<P>
   As the industry has grown in recent years, the pilots' position
has became more pivotal. ``They occupy a good square on the
board,'' said an executive at a major airline who has faced them
across the negotiating table. ``Alone among the large work groups,
they can shut down the airline and it is not practical to replace
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet at the same time, the job itself has become more mundane.
Commercial jets have become more automated, requiring less actual
flying skill. In any case, airline pilots cannot rise on merit.
They move from second officer to first officer to captain, earning
progressively higher pay, based on their years at the airline.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are for the most part overachievers, but they can't show
their skill,'' said a second airline executive who insisted on
anonymity for fear of jeopardizing relations with the pilots at his
carrier. ``They can't move to another airline because of seniority.
All they can do is sit around and complain about `their deal.' The
deal becomes the way they measure their progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Pilot groups have often had trouble even getting along with each
other. The Allied Pilots Association split off from the Air Line
Pilots Association in 1963, becoming an independent union, because
of a complex set of events that boiled down to a personality clash
between two pilot leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Even though American's pilots now appear to be demanding higher
pay for pilots at Reno Air, the latter are unhappy because the
Allied Pilots Association has suggested putting the Reno pilots at
the bottom of its seniority list. The Reno pilots want some credit
for their years at the airline and they complain that the American
pilots have refused to negotiate with them.
</P>
<P>
   But by far the most friction remains between pilots and
management. Some of the bitterest battles took place after the
airline industry was deregulated 20 years ago. Several venerable
airlines, including Braniff, Eastern and Pan American, filed for
bankruptcy and ultimately went out of business, forcing many pilots
with years of experience to start over at the bottom of the ladder
at other carriers. Many of the airlines that survived demanded that
pilots roll back wages and make other concessions. Then, when the
industry turned around, they found that management opposed raising
their wages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pilots see themselves as having been completely taken by
management since the era of deregulation began,'' Hopkins said.
</P>
<P>
   That has certainly been the case at American, even though the
airline has emerged from deregulation as one of the industry's
strongest competitors. The pilots feel that they had to fight with
Robert Crandall, American's combative former chairman and chief
executive, for everything they now have.
</P>
<P>
   Many American pilots are still bitter about a two-tier wage
scale introduced by Crandall in the mid-1980s that paid newly hired
pilots less than those already flying. They also remember cutbacks
and layoffs in the early 1990s that they say enabled Reno Air to
get its start. And they are still angry about their brief strike
two years ago, which was ended when President Clinton ordered them
back to work.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton then appointed a special emergency board, which helped
the union and the airline work out a tentative contract. Many
pilots felt they had no choice but to ratify the agreement;
otherwise, Congress could have imposed a contract on the union.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, many pilots stopped volunteering for overtime,
forcing American to cancel a modest number of flights, after it
discovered that the airline was placing more American passengers on
Canadian Airlines, one of its foreign partners, than was allowed in
an agreement with the union. Many pilots are also angry that a new
system for scheduling flights is not as flexible as the airline
promised.
</P>
<P>
   All this was in the background, when the union learned on Dec.
28 that American had taken full control of Reno Air. American said
that it discussed the Reno Air purchase with leaders of the pilots
union and that they raised no objections. But the airline closed
the deal without first reaching an agreement with the union over
how it would merge the two carriers.
</P>
<P>
   American later said that it would take as long as 18 months to
combine the two airlines because it needed to refit Reno Air's
airplanes and retrain crews at the two airlines. The pilots suspect
that the company is dragging out the integration so that it can
continue to pay Reno Air pilots at lower rates. It is worried about
setting a precedent for future acquisitions, perhaps of much larger
airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The union has said that the 150 jobs as captains at Reno Air now
belong to pilots at American and that the company should begin
paying every American pilot as if the transition had been
completed. American responded that doing that would give immediate
raises to 2,000 pilots as the promotions rippled through the ranks,
costing $50 million in 1999 alone. The two sides tried to negotiate
a resolution for five weeks before the exasperated pilots began
calling in sick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than signing a transition agreement with APA that would
allow both completion of Reno's integration as well as compliance
with our basic contract, AMR has so far stonewalled APA's
negotiators on this important issue,'' Richard LaVoy, the union's
president, said.
</P>
<P>
   American says it has not violated the pilot contract and does
not understand what all the fuss is about. ``We intend to pay Reno
pilots American Airlines wages, and we intend to offer promotion
opportunities to APA pilots who will benefit from the airline's
expansion on the West Coast,'' the company has said.
</P>
<P>
   But to the many pilots who stopped trusting American executives
a long time ago, promises are not enough.

28 that American had taken full control of Reno Air. American said
that it discussed the Reno Air purchase with leaders of the pilots
union and that they raised no objections. But the airline closed
the deal without first reaching an agreement with the union over
how it would merge the two carriers.
</P>
<P>
   American later said that it would take as long as 18 months to
combine the two airlines because it needed to refit Reno Air's
airplanes and retrain crews at the two airlines. The pilots suspect
that the company is dragging out the integration so that it can
continue to pay Reno Air pilots at lower rates. It is worried about
setting a precedent for future acquisitions, perhaps of much larger
airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The union has said that the 150 jobs as captains at Reno Air now
belong to pilots at American and that the company should begin
paying every American pilot as if the transition had been
completed. American responded that doing that would give immediate
raises to 2,000 pilots as the promotions rippled through the ranks,
costing $50 million in 1999 alone. The two sides tried to negotiate
a resolution for five weeks before the exasperated pilots began
calling in sick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than signing a transition agreement with APA that would
allow both completion of Reno's integration as well as compliance
with our basic contract, AMR has so far stonewalled APA's
negotiators on this important issue,'' Richard LaVoy, the union's
president, said.
</P>
<P>
   American says it has not violated the pilot contract and does
not understand what all the fuss is about. ``We intend to pay Reno
pilots American Airlines wages, and we intend to offer promotion
opportunities to APA pilots who will benefit from the airline's
expansion on the West Coast,'' the company has said.
</P>
<P>
   But to the many pilots who stopped trusting American executives
a long time ago, promises are not enough.

12 ROUNDS, THEN A LIFETIME OF REGRETS FOR QUARTEY 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ghana, England, Japan)  By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ An hour after his split-decision victory over Ike
Quartey, Oscar De La Hoya held a small frozen cup over a lump the
size and color of a small tomato under his left eye. The knot was
there thanks to the steady pounding of Quartey's jab over 12
rounds. But the pain will soon subside, and it is not a scar he
will carry forever.
</P>
<P>
   Quartey wasn't as battered as De La Hoya, who kept his World
Boxing Council welterweight title, but he will be hurting for a
while. That's because he will probably spend the rest of his career
kicking himself for losing a fight that he could have easily won.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to his jab, Quartey was able to take most of the early
rounds of the fight and keep De La Hoya off balance. But after the
sixth round, what little offense Quartey managed in the early
rounds completely disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Then in the 12th round, De La Hoya came out and battered
Quartey, dropping him for the second time in the fight and securing
a split decision over Quartey, the former World Boxing Association
welterweight champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't do anything,'' Quartey said. ``I did everything. He
came to survive. That's what he did. He knew if he survived for 12
rounds, he'd win the decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Quartey's bitterness was tempered by his promoter, Dino Duva of
Main Events, who had watched another of his fighters, Pernell
Whitaker, surrender his title to De La Hoya two years ago in a much
closer fight. Duva said he believes that both Quartey and Whitaker
won their fights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ike Quartey came into a hostile territory and fought a war
against your man,'' Duva said to a derisive mob of De La Hoya fans
who shouted down Quartey, a native of Accra, Ghana, for not being
gracious in defeat. ``Give him the credit he deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   Quartey's belief that he had won the fight was shared by only
one judge, Larry O'Connell of Hartley, England, who scored the
fight 115-114 for Quartey. Judge Ken Morita of Sapporo, Japan, had
it 116-112 and judge John Keane of Northants, England, scored it
116-113, both for De La Hoya. All three judges had De La Hoya
winning the last three rounds.
</P>
<P>
   For the 26-year-old De La Hoya, who earned $9 million for the
bout, it was a resounding victory that certifies him as the top
welterweight in a talented and crowded field. He now has victories
over two previous welterweight world champions, Whitaker and
Quartey. Whitaker will fight Felix Trinidad next Saturday at
Madison Square Garden in another major welterweight battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept my title,'' De La Hoya said. ``I proved to the world
that I could go against the best.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was a struggle for De La Hoya, who said that he made a
tactical error and may have given the hard-hitting Quartey too much
respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was too wide open when I unleashed the punches,'' De La Hoya
said. ``The times I did drop him I threw the 4-5, which is that
uppercut and left hook. I made it a tactical fight, which I wasn't
supposed to do. I did that tonight, and I did it against Pernell
Whitaker. My style is being aggressive. I'm finding out I've been
giving too much respect to my opponents. I have to be more
aggressive. That's a learning process. I just have to go to the gym
and work on some things.''
</P>
<P>
   Gil Clancy, De La Hoya's co-trainer, said they had developed a
strategy that called for De La Hoya to move laterally and give
Quartey different angles, making it difficult for him to throw
punches that would land. ``He spent the whole fight fighting
Quartey's fight, staying in front of him, feinting and not throwing
his jab,'' Clancy said.
</P>
<P>
   The two times that De La Hoya was aggressive, he scored against
Quartey. In the sixth round he tagged Quartey with a left hook and
floored him. A short time later in the round, Quartey caught De La
Hoya on the chin and dropped him.
</P>
<P>
   There were conflicting messages from De La Hoya's corner heading
into the 12th round. Roberto Alcazar, his chief trainer, told De La
Hoya that he was winning the fight and not to do anything to throw
the fight away. Clancy told De La Hoya that he needed to win the
12th round and that he needed to throw combinations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never believe a fighter has the fight won,'' Clancy said.
``I always tell a fighter to go out and win the 12th round.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya went out and threw 69 punches in the first two
minutes of the round, landing 41 and decking Quartey with a left
hook. But he punched himself out and didn't throw anything over the
last minute. Quartey, who faded badly, didn't have anything left
either. The result was that De La Hoya put on the performance of a
champion for the first time since he won the title from Whitaker in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to go out with a bang to show my courage and prove that
I could fight, to keep my title and get a good devastating win,''
De La Hoya said.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya said he was going to take some time off and decide
who his next opponent would be. On the undercard, Oba Carr won a
12-round unanimous decision over Frankie Randall, potentially
setting up a meeting with De La Hoya in May.

TANKING UP 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Falling gasoline prices are a boon for consumers and the US
Treasury, which collects 18 cents a gallon in taxes, but they are
reshaping tastes in ways that require some careful thinking. This
is the right time to start addressing serious problems of urban
congestion and a degraded environment.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who thought gasoline would never again be available for
less than a dollar a gallon has had a pleasant surprise. It is
commonplace to see off-brands for 95 cents or even less. In fact,
gasoline prices are now at their lowest level ever when adjusted
for inflation, according to the American Petroleum Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that automobiles have become more
fuel-efficient, averaging more than 20 miles per gallon today
compared with 14 miles a gallon in the early 1970s, consumption has
risen to about 8 million barrels a day now compared with 6 million
then.
</P>
<P>
   One of the key factors has been a surge of interest in sport
utility vehicles, which are exempt from federal gasoline
consumption rules.
</P>
<P>
   Federal gasoline taxes were 4 cents a gallon in the early 70s
and are 18 cents a gallon today, so receipts have gone from $10
million a day then to more than $60 million today _ $22 billion a
year. The Department of Transportation estimates that the figure,
thanks to added consumption, will rise by about $1.4 billion above
recent projections.
</P>
<P>
   Most of that pays for road and bridge projects like the massive
Big Dig. But more of these revenues should be used to address
longer-term transportation problems. Bigger vehicles take more
space on the roads, as anyone who has been sandwiched between two
SUVs can attest. They are adding disproportionately to emissions
and take more space when they park.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the extra revenue should be used to offset those impacts
by going back to additional rail and bus service, to research on
improved efficiency, and to getting a handle on the road gluttons.
Otherwise we may all drown in gasoline.

WOMEN'S GROWTH IN SOCCER NOTED IN WORLD CUP DRAW
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Kim Sun Hui was already 17 years old when she
first touched a soccer ball with her instep. Before that, women
were not encouraged to play soccer in her country, North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when many nations are promoting soccer as the major
team sport for female athletes, Kim made the transition from track
and field to soccer. Sunday she was here from Pyongyang, playing in
an all-star game to promote the Women's World Cup of soccer that
begins four months from now, and will be played at stadiums around
the United States June 19 to July 10.
</P>
<P>
   The North Korean team was one of the 16 nations (14 qualifiers
plus the United States as the host nation and Norway as the
defending champion) placed in the draw at halftime Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future of football is feminine,'' is the operative slogan
from Joseph (Sepp) Blatter, the head of the world soccer body known
as FIFA.
</P>
<P>
   As soccer grows in popularity among women _ an estimated 30
million now play _ many of them tell the same story about facing
stereotypes that soccer is a tough-guy game, not suitable for
tender females.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, `the women should be home in the kitchen,' '' said Ulrika
Karlsson, the goalkeeper from Sweden, surely one of the more
advanced nations for the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Other nations are catching up, trying to catch up in the huge
swell of interest since the first Women's World Cup in China in
1991 and the second in Sweden in 1995. North Korea has come from
virtually nowhere to qualify _ the first time any soccer team from
that nation has reached a World Cup since the mysterious men's team
inflicted considerable pain to established nations in the classic
1966 World Cup in England.
</P>
<P>
   Kim did not begin the way many other of Sunday's all-stars did _
playing against boys in her neighborhood. She was trained as a
defender, is quite proud of her ability to intercept passes near
the goal, but said, through a translator, ``I am very pleased to be
in the vanguard, but I am always hoping I am not too late to learn
soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of her teammates Sunday have a full decade of experience on
her. Mercy Akide of Nigeria, a rangy midfielder, said that she grew
up playing with boys. ``They called me Tomboy,'' she said with a
big smile, but she said that the women's game has become popular.
</P>
<P>
   Graziele Grazi of Brazil, a lithe 17-year-old known only by one
name in Brazilian soccer fashion, spoke openly about the old
stereotype: ``In Brazil there was a lot of bias against women
playing soccer. Some people thought that only lesbians played
soccer. But now this is not as much of an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of attitudes Graziele describes, women's soccer in
Brazil has developed slowly, despite that country's being the
emotional center of the men's sport. In the team brochure, the
players list their soccer idol and Graziele lists Denilson and most
of her teammates list Zico, Romario or Ronaldo or other male stars,
but two women do list their teammate, Sisleide Lima do Amor, known
as Sissi.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of talent in Brazil,'' Graziele said. ``Our
men's team did not win the World Cup in France so maybe we can win
in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Some all-stars have come through an established club system,
like Sue Smith of England, whose country did not qualify for the
World Cup. Smith is from Liverpool, and grew up playing against
boys in a park _ not on Penny Lane, she replied patiently.
``Everybody asks me that.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith joined a local club called Tranmere Rovers that has
recently beaten the women from both Liverpool and Everton, the two
civic powers. Born into a family that roots for Everton, Smith
sheepishly admits that as a left wing she emulates Ryan Giggs, the
Welsh left wing for Manchester United.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you switch on the telly, that's what you see,'' Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
   But this summer the women will be on the telly _ all 32 games
shown by ABC and ESPN and many available around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, which won the 1996 Summer Olympics
tournament, is the favorite, and has been seeded into a host slot
for games in Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., on June 19,
Soldier Field in Chicago on June 24 and Foxboro Stadium in
Massachusetts on June 27.
</P>
<P>
   Norway, the defending champion, hopes to meet the United States
in the final in the Rose Bowl on July 10. The Norwegians will have
a bicoastal schedule in the first round, and could be affected by
the heat as well as the jet lag.
</P>
<P>
   Then, consider the team seeded fourth in Group C _ Foxboro on
June 20, Civic Stadium in Portland, Ore., on the night of June 23,
then back to Giants Stadium for a noon game on June 26 _ grueling
conditions even for millionaire males in professional basketball.
</P>
<P>
   This may not be a consolation for weary female athletes, but
perhaps these brutal schleps around this huge country are a sign
that women's soccer is reaching the big time. &QL;

MIRANDA WRONGED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On television a defendant's Miranda rights have the healthy life
that they deserve as a pillar of American democracy. In real life
they are being destructively chipped away.
</P>
<P>
   Fictional police, to convey irony, anger, or pleasure, rely on
the Miranda chant: ``You have the right to remain silent. You have
the right to an attorney. You have the right to have an attorney
appointed if you cannot afford one. Anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law.''
</P>
<P>
   This drill sprang from a 1966 Supreme Court ruling on the cases
of Ernesto Miranda, charged with rape and kidnapping, and other
defendants.
</P>
<P>
   It was not, as the ruling explained, an ``innovation.'' Miranda
bundled already existing rights to address a history of unjust
interrogations that stretched back to pre-Colonial days in England.
The ruling also pointed to 1930s America, with its police violence
and infamous use of the ``third degree.'' With an eye for human
weakness, the court cited the ``temptation to press the witness
unduly, to browbeat him if he be timid or reluctant.''
</P>
<P>
   But this week, a bruising attack waged by a federal appeals
court in Virginia threatens to degrade Miranda from a
constitutionally &UR;  &LR; based right to merely a good but not always
necessary idea.
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia court cited a 1968 law saying confessions could be
admissible in court if they were given voluntarily. In other words,
33-year-old Miranda was overruled 31 years ago. It is fine, said
the court _ and should have been for decades _ for federal
prosecutors to ignore Miranda.
</P>
<P>
   This finding is outrageous. It may technically adhere to the
1968 law _ one the Justice Department has never enforced _ but it
is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In 15 seconds a police officer can state Miranda rights,
providing a key democratic and American protection with almost no
effort. This can hardly be a barrier given today's sophisticated
investigatory and technological tools.
</P>
<P>
   If protecting Miranda means repealing the 1968 law, Congress
should do so. Otherwise the fulfillment of the Bill of Rights _
from its protection against self-incrimination to the right to
counsel _ will be changed from groundbreaking history to a historic
waste of time.

STUDY SAYS INDIANS ARE VIOLENT CRIME VICTIMS AT TWICE NATIONAL
AVERAGE
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif., Okla,., N.M., Ariz.)  (ms) 
 By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   American Indians are the victims of violent crimes at more than
twice the national average and, unlike the situation among whites
and blacks where the large majority of crime victims are of the
same race as the perpetrators, 70 percent of those committing
crimes against Indians are of a different race, according to the
first comprehensive study of crimes involving Indians, which was
released Sunday by the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that the nation's 2.3 million Indians were far
more likely to be victims of violent crimes than members of any
other racial group, and that the rate of violent crime experienced
by Indian women is nearly 50 percent higher than that by black
males.
</P>
<P>
   A full 60 percent of the perpetrators of violent crimes against
Indians were whites, according to the victims, while 29 percent of
the offenders were other Indians and 10 percent were described as
black, the report said. By contrast, other studies have shown that
69 percent of the perpetrators of violent crimes against whites are
also white, and 81 percent of those committing violent crimes
against blacks are themselves black.
</P>
<P>
   ``This highlights what has been going on out there for 130
years, since the beginning of the reservation system,'' said Sidney
Harring, a professor of law at the City University of New York
School of Law and an expert on Indian crime and criminal law.
</P>
<P>
   Harring said much of the violence against Indians by other
racial groups was attributable to racism and alcohol, ``with
Indians being victimized by poor, drunken whites, people on the
margins hurting each other.'' There are still high levels of
prejudice against Indians in the West, where most Indians live, he
said, and a culture that lives on the edges of Indian reservations
``that tolerates this violence,'' even among law enforcement
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Suzan Shown Harjo, president of the Morning Star Institute, an
Indians' rights advocacy group in Washington, took an even more
sweeping position, saying, ``This may actually represent a downturn
in violence over the centuries since we first encountered
Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least it's not genocidal,'' said Ms. Harjo, who is part
Cheyenee and part Muscogee. ``Now they are taking Indians out one
by one.''
</P>
<P>
   The study was published by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the
statistical branch of the Justice Department, using data gathered
from 1992 to 1996 by the National Crime Victimization Survey, which
asks a sample of American households each year about crimes they
have experienced. The survey measures the violent crimes of rape,
robbery, aggravated assault and simple assault. To supplement the
survey, the justice department added data on homicides gathered by
the FBI from local police reports.
</P>
<P>
   The victimization survey is considered a reliable measure of
crime by criminologists.
</P>
<P>
   According to the survey, the average annual rate at which
Indians were victims of crimes _ 124 per 1,000 people, ages 12 or
older _ is about two and a half times the national average of 50
crimes per 1,000 people who are above the age of 12. The average
for whites was 49 per 1,000 people; for blacks, 61 per 1,000; and
for Asians, 29 per 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol played a major part in violent crimes against Indians,
both those committed by Indians against each other and those
committed by people of other racial groups, the report found.
Indian victims reported that the perpetrator had been drinking in
46 percent of violent crimes against them, the highest of any
racial group, while 70 percent of Indians convicted of violence who
were in jail said they had been drinking at the time of their
offense.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the survey found that the arrest rate for
alcohol-related offenses among Indians (including drunken driving,
liquor law violations and public drunkenness) was more than double
that for the total population during 1996, though the arrest rate
for drug offenses was lower than for other races.
</P>
<P>
   The four states with the most Indian residents were; Oklahoma,
with 252,000, followed by California, Arizona and New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Iverson, a professor of history at Arizona State
University, said that there had been a significant shift in Indian
population over the past 20 years, with a majority of Indians now
living in urban areas. But those Indians in cities form a small
part of the metropolitan area and do not live in segregated areas,
so they are much more likely to come in contact with people of
other groups. Residential segregation is often part of the
explanation for the tendency of whites to commit violence against
whites, and blacks against other blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson said that in rural areas bordering Indian reservations,
``you still have significant prejudice against Indian people
providing traditional justification for violence.'' Historically,
he said, Indians entered these communities to shop, or to buy
alcohol or for entertainment, and though whites in these towns made
money off the Indians, ``there has long been an uneasy
relationship, even resentment.'' In this situation, arguments,
fueled by alcohol, could quickly become violent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the report said that the murder rate by Indians in
1996 was 4 per 100,000, below the national average of 7.9 per
100,000, and less than the white rate of 4.9 per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   From 1991 to 1996, the murder rate by Indians fell 20 percent,
faster than the overall national decline of 15 percent.

 &HT;    Luxury fabrics in drab brown, olive slink down Fashion Week

<P>
   NEW YORK _ At this point, the news from Fashion Week that might
matter to the most people is also the least exciting.
</P>
<P>
   Brown _ not fuschia, not periwinkle, not even gray, for goodness
sake _ has been the most prevalent color shown by designers so far
during previews of their fall/winter collections. News of the
second most-often shown color _ olive _ is equally drab.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the question of color, some interesting patterns that the
masses might not be ready to embrace are taking shape.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the clothes for the last cold-weather season of
this century are taking a stance of pre-millenial preparedness.
More often than not, they're being rendered in the luxury fabrics
commonly associated with the rich and pampered. But stylistically,
they present a look that asserts, ``I'm strong, confident and savvy
enough to withstand whatever follows that fated stroke of
midnight.''
</P>
<P>
   JOHN BARTLETT
</P>
<P>
   In this collection, Bartlett offered a vision of 21st-century
pioneers. His models _ male and female, since this is the first
time New York has combined its men's and women's fashion weeks _
wore their clothes like body armour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boiled'' cashmere, ``bonded'' wool, ``iron'' cotton and
``oxidized'' gabardine were among the fabrics. Outfits for both
sexes featured deep-pocketed aprons, and most clothes were fitted
to showcase all the alluring things about our bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett clings to the ``utility'' trend; he affixed
militaristic terms to shirts (``CPO''), pants (``sailor'') and
coats (``field''). But he helps utility evolve by making it
precious: His capes were glorious collages of distressed, colored
leather; his sweaters were bundles of joy; his slinky dresses would
look seductive even on hangers.
</P>
<P>
   JOSEPH ABBOUD
</P>
<P>
   Two factors were missing from this show: telejournalist Bryant
Gumbel, who normally sits front and center at Abboud's shows and
wears his next-door neighbor's designs routinely, and the attitude
of understated elegance that has been Abboud's trademark. Neither
was particularly missed.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than work its way up to the formal wear segment, as most
shows do, Abboud's kicked off with an intimidating display of what
the boldest among the beautiful should be wearing on New Year's
Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Menswear is Abboud's top priority, but his velvet halters and
satin pants topped by wrap vests proved that one great evening look
is all a stylish woman needs. For day, Abboud put women in suits
made for walking: elongated coats, trim pants, low-heeled shoes.
</P>
<P>
   His clothes for men demand to be touched, insist on being seen.
Formal wear consisted of velvet robes and paisley dinner jackets
and suede pants. Clothing was tailored to show a lot of the tie,
the cuffs, the shoes. Thanks to an extensive use of stripes and
plaids and paisley, everything looked bright.
</P>
<P>
   Considering its restriction to a gray, ivory and bronze color
scheme, Abboud was right in calling the collection ``artistry.

SEVERAL LAWSUITS   CHALLENGE INTERNET ADS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A recent round of lawsuits, including one from Playboy
Enterprises, threatens to challenge some fundamental assumptions of
Internet advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Playboy, no stranger to the courts when it comes to protecting
its famous brand, is suing Netscape Communications and Excite &UR;  &LR; in
an effort to keep banner ads for pornographic, non-Playboy sites
from appearing when Web surfers use either Netscape or Excite to
look for material with the key words ``playboy'' or ``playmate.''
Searching for Playboy magazine on Excite, for example, summons a
come-hither ad from Tease.com.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few weeks before, Estee Lauder &UR;  &LR; filed a similar lawsuit
against Excite, accusing the search service of trademark
infringement, ``bait and switch'' false advertising and unfair
competition.
</P>
<P>
   A search for Estee Lauder on Excite, or on Excite's associated
search provider, Web Crawler, brings up an ad for the Fragrance
Counter _ a retailer that Estee Lauder says is not an authorized
seller of Estee Lauder products. The Fragrance Counter is also
named in the Estee Lauder suit.
</P>
<P>
   Selling advertisers access to so-called key words, so that their
banner ads appear near certain search results based on the key
words _ such as a competitor's brand name _ is widespread in the
Internet business.
</P>
<P>
   Typing in ``Amazon'' on the Lycos search engine, for instance,
may elicit an ad for the bookseller Amazon.com's chief rival,
Barnes &AMP; Noble. Searching for a pair of Levi's jeans with Netscape
may bring up an ad for the Gap.
</P>
<P>
   (To find out just how widely their names are being used in
keyword purchases, companies often use a free service called
Bannerstake _ www.namestake.com _ to display ads associated with
their names.)
</P>
<P>
   Currently, ad sales based on key words account for roughly a
quarter of the advertising revenue generated by portal and search
sites like Excite _ a category of Web sites that together generated
more than $450 million from advertising, according to Jupiter
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   If Playboy and Estee Lauder prevail in court, the rules of
Internet advertising would need to be substantially rewritten. ``At
the end of the day, the search engines are selling advertising
against a trademarked name and making a profit on it,'' said Drew
Ianni, a Jupiter analyst. ``Any change would have an impact on the
bottom line.''

   Can You Play `Feelings' On the Ocarina?
</P>
<P>
   The new Nintendo video game, ``Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of
Time,'' is on pace to become one of the best-selling video games
ever. And its popularity seems to have spawned another craze _
demand for real ocarinas, those flute-like musical instruments that
look like sweet potatoes with finger holes.
</P>
<P>
   In the video game, its elfin hero, Link, travels through time
and the magical world of Hyrule, doing battle with his nemesis,
Ganondorf, to save Princess Zelda. Playing his ocarina transports
Link through time and space.
</P>
<P>
   Many Nintendo fans are transporting themselves on the Web in
search of their own ocarinas. Anita Feng, an artisan in Issaquah,
Wash., who has been making traditional-style ceramic ocarinas for
25 years, has seen her business more than double to about 60
handmade instruments a month, since the Nintendo game was released
in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, about three-fourths of my business is from people
who played the game,'' said Ms. Feng, who operates the Anita's
Ocarinas site (www.scn.org/bg599). She said she received five to 10
orders daily, primarily for the 10-hole ocarinas, like the one
played by Luke.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Feng said she might have to hire help to handle the new
orders.
</P>
<P>
   The ocarina boomlet brings rare cachet to an instrument believed
to have been invented in the 1860s by an Italian, Guiseppe Donati,
who gave them a name meaning ``little goose.'' But then, rarely has
there been a video game as popular as the latest version of Zelda,
who has been a Nintendo character since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   During the last six weeks of 1998, the game sold about 2.5
million units, generating $150 million in revenue. Nintendo is
projecting eventual sales of six million copies or more of Ocarina
in Time.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Feng has seen her business boom, not all ocarina
makers have been as lucky. Charlie Hind, for instance, says he has
seen only a limited increase in ocarina sales at Hind Musical
Instruments (www.germanmarketplace.com/hind.htm.)
</P>
<P>
   Zelda fans may revel in virtual adventures on screen, but when
it comes to ocarinas they seem to demand authenticity. Some have
scoffed at buying Hind's ocarinas, which instead of being ceramic
are made of wood.

O.J.'S GARAGE SALE GOES ONLINE TUESDAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At 6 p.m. Tuesday, O.J. Simpson's ``Garage Sale of
the Century'' takes place online. Unfortunately, he won't be around
to make change for a $20.
</P>
<P>
   Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield auction house on Sunset Boulevard
conducts the live bidding process for Simpson property seized to
help settle the $25 million civil judgment won by the families of
murder victims Ron Goldman and Nicole Brown Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   Online and incognito, the auction is accessible through
LiveBid.com ( http://www.livebid.com ) as well as Yahoo! Auctions (
http://auctions.yahoo.com ). Pre-auction registration, which has
already been very active, is required.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the online process that took place recently for Mark
McGwire's 70th home run ball _ the highest bid was used as a
starting point for the (begin ital)real(end ital) bidding done at a
Chicago auction house _ this will go along in real time, allowing
those who just want to sit and watch do so.
</P>
<P>
   You may have already seen the flashier stuff up for grabs, such
as his '68 Heisman trophy, expected to fetch more than $100,000.
But included in the 77 pieces are many other awards given to him
through the years.
</P>
<P>
   Such as Lot No.1049 _ two trophies awarded by Life Savers to him
in 1973 for being Life Saver of the Year and Life Saver of the
Month. According to the auction house information, the latter
piece, which at one time had a statuette of a man affixed to the
top of a silver-plated cup, is now broken. &QL;

 &HT;    Orange accessories shine in the Big Apple
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Common things _ such as arriving at a runway show
only to find some shifty-eyed gate-crasher sitting in the chair
assigned to you _ are what make people chronically standoffish
during Fashion Week.
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness for the oddball things _ like Atlanta-based
Kleinberg Sherrill's luxury handbags _ that bring people together.
</P>
<P>
   An orange alligator-skin purse and matching, silver-buckled belt
by Kleinberg Sherrill was one of 38 orange items being auctioned
over the weekend at the Look Art Gallery in the East Village as
part of a ``Celebration of Accessories'' exhibition. And it's the
Kleinberg Sherrill purse and belt that the Atlantans, as well as
the thousands of others gathered here this week to critique
clothes, gravitated to during the opening gala.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bag? It's chic and glamorous and luxurious, like
something the Europeans carry,'' said Daphne Shirley, a publicist.
``And the matte color of it is certainly left of center. Everything
else here is like the color of SunKist. This is more like a
tangerine.''
</P>
<P>
   Orange, incidentally, is starting to look like one of the key
accent colors for fall/winter 1999-2000. And luxury leathers
apparently are going to play an even more important role in the way
fashionable women dress.
</P>
<P>
   ``My business is skyrocketing,'' said Page Bondurant, director
of sales for Trussardi, a luxury leather goods company. ``That's
all the stores want nowadays: leather, leather, leather. Leather
pants, leather T-shirts. And colored leathers especially. Purple.
Green. Pastel pink.''
</P>
<P>
   Time Life publicist Carolyn Burnette was delighted to see the
Kleinberg Sherrill bag and belt, and made an opening bid of $500
for the duo. She thought they would make a great gift for her
sister Adrienne. What she didn't realize was that the minimum bid
was $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bag is something that'll live past this trend with the
color orange,'' Burnette said.
</P>
<P>
   After arriving fashionably late for the exhibition _ wearing a
bright red ``Afro'' (think big and fuzzy) coat, with 3 1/2-year-old
daughter Anabelle in tow _ Marcia Sherrill explained that the
orange pieces were ``slight modifications on bags and belts in our
existing collection.''
</P>
<P>
   She seemed much more interested in cornering Kevin Knaus, chief
of the career counseling agency InsideFashion, and dishing the dirt
on friends back in Atlanta. And she served up this tidbit of her
own: New York magazine is doing a feature on Anabelle's room in its
March 15 issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is why I came here tonight,'' Sherrill said. ``For the
chance to see friends from home.

 &HT;    Engine problems slow Stewart, Labonte
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ For his very first Winston Cup race,
rookie Tony Stewart felt the pain of a veteran and, as bad luck
would have it, the veteran he could most identify with is his
teammate in the Joe Gibbs garage, Bobby Labonte.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart started on the outside pole in Sunday's Daytona 500 but
quickly drifted back into the pack with a faulty engine. He fought
the bad motor all day and finished 28th in the No. 20 Pontiac.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte started third, led 20 of the first 42 laps and then
faded to a 25th place finish in the No. 18 Pontiac because of a
misfiring engine.
</P>
<P>
   ''We spent so much time in the pits because we were trying to
figure out why the motor wasn't running,'' Stewart said. ''We lost
a cylinder. We probably won't know for certain till we get back to
the shop, tear the motor and find out. We for sure lost one
cylinder. Nothing you can do about it. If it was something I did,
that would be one thing. You're just kind of a victim out here
riding around. It happened to Bobby, too. All we can do is go out
there and make laps and try to gain as many points as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte was singing the same blues.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were really strong early on and were able to take the lead
and get our five bonus points out of the way quick,'' Labonte said.
''Then it developed a miss pretty early and I kept falling slowly
back. We still don't really know what it was. Tony had a
similar-type miss, too. It's disappointing because we showed from
the start we were one of the cars to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   This was Stewart's debut in a Winston Cup car after a successful
career in Indy cars. He was impressed. ''It's definitely the
biggest stock car race in the world, that's for sure,'' he said.
''To come here today and see all the fans out here, it's similar to
the Indy atmosphere just with a different style of race car and
different type of fan.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of education was gained on the track.
</P>
<P>
   First, he had to learn about drafting on a speedway. ''I'm
learning (about the draft),'' he said. ''There's still a lot of
knowledge to be learned out there. I think we learned enough in the
125 (qualifying race) to at least keep up us semi-competitive
today. We got shuffled back a little bit, got back in line and
start picking our way back up through there. I feel like we a
pretty good boost for the next time we come back here or Talladega.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not telling anybody what we learned about drafting. It's
stuff I've learned that most of these other drivers already know.
But the ones that don't, I don't want to help them out. We learned
a lot. We brought the car back in one piece, and that was our main
goal. We wanted to finish the race higher, obviously, but all
things considered that was out of our control. So we're kind of
happy.''

AN AIRBRUSHED JACKSON POLLOCK? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Tuesday, February 16, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The US Postal Service took the cigarette out of Jackson
Pollock's mouth for his portrait on a new 33-cent stamp. While a
spokesman insists this was a ``design decision'' that had nothing
to do with the government's antismoking campaign, the change is
unsettling because it tells a lie, albeit a small one, about this
master of abstract expressionism.
</P>
<P>
   Pollock was a chain-smoker who worked with his trademark
cigarette dangling from his lips as he squatted down next to a
canvas on the floor, dripping and swirling paints into his
fantastic designs. That was exactly how photographer Martha Holmes
snapped him for a 1949 cover story in Life magazine. But an
artist's rendering of that photo for the 1999 stamp eliminates
Pollack's bad habit _ and sucks the tension out of the pose.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Smeraldi, press officer at the Postal Service, notes that
the stamp is part of a ``Celebrate the Century'' series and is
supposed to commemorate abstract expressionism in America rather
than being a tribute to Pollock. He says eliminating the cigarette
was no big deal: ``It was a minor element and didn't have to be
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes it did. That ``minor element'' was a part of who Pollock
was, and anything commemorating the art should not divorce itself
from the artist. Similarly, no portrait of Edward R. Morrow is
complete without the cigarette, which was as much a part of the man
as a microphone, although neither appears on his 1994 US postage
stamp. Smoking blues guitarist Robert Johnson was also forced to
quit cold turkey on a 1994 stamp.
</P>
<P>
   It's interesting that President Franklin D. Roosevelt got to
keep his long, upturned cigarette holder in a 1982 Postal Service
rendering, although Smeraldi wasn't sure why. Presidential
privilege, perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   No one is condoning smoking here. The mountain of research on
that subject is clear. But revisionist history on legends is often
murky. Little things, good or bad, say a lot about a person and the
America in which he or she lived. They should not be air-brushed
away _ not even in miniature in the corner of an envelope.

ANALYSIS: CLINTON'S PLAN TO SEND TROOPS TO KOSOVO REVIVES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz.)   (See also KOSOVO-TALKS)

<TEXT>
<P>
   While President Clinton's proposal to send American troops to
Kosovo heartened promoters of a more active American role in
preventing ethnic carnage, it also aroused fears that the
administration is marching into an ancient swamp without a clear
idea of how not to get mired in it.
</P>
<P>
   In his announcement Saturday, Clinton said about 4,000 troops
would be sent to the Serbian province of Kosovo only if the warring
ethnic Albanians and Serbs there agreed, and only as part of a far
larger, 28,000-strong NATO peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   He argued that it was in the United States' national interest to
resolve a conflict that could lead to ``tremendous loss of life and
a massive refugee crisis in the middle of Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   There was little debate among foreign-policy experts and
politicians that stopping bloodshed was a worthy objective in
itself, and that the struggle in Kosovo, an enclave bordering on
Albania and Macedonia with a predominant population of ethnic
Albanians, had the potential to escalate into something far larger
and more threatening.
</P>
<P>
   The doubts focused on whether Kosovo really touched on American
national interests, and whether the administration really knew what
it was getting into, or how to get out of a region notorious for
its instability and complexity. More broadly, critics charged that
Washington was plunging into the morass of the Balkans without a
concrete idea of its role as the world's sole superpower.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very torn about it,'' said Henry Kissinger, the former
secretary of state. ``At this point I will support it, but we can't
do this. We can't get involved in every ethnic conflict as a police
force without sooner or later getting overextended. I think we need
a national discussion about what we are trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Among congressional critics, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., took a
similar stance. He said he would support the dispatch of forces to
Kosovo because of the threat of broader conflict, but ``with great
reluctance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no exit strategy,'' he said. ``We have no concept of
how we want to settle this situation.'' This was so, he added, even
though the president has been aware of the Kosovo crisis for a long
time.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., agreed on the dangers, and
also on the need to prevent the conflict from spreading. ``The
Balkans is a place you can go and you can get lost and never be
seen again or heard from again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett Rubin, who has followed the crisis as director of the
program on preventive action at the Council on Foreign Relations,
argued that the very instability of the region made it a national
interest, as the United States has long considered its security
linked to European security.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conflict in Kosovo, apart from any humanitarian aspect,
has the threat of spreading in that region,'' he said. ``It could
draw in Greece, then Turkey. This is the southeastern flank of
NATO, which involves relations with Russia, Germany and other
things important to us. So even though there's no immediate threat,
this doesn't mean it doesn't involve our interests.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those interests, argue American officials and others who
support Clinton's decision, is the intangible damage to NATO
credibility if the alliance allows massacres and open warring to
continue unrestrained in Europe. The costs of idleness in the face
of atrocity could well outweigh the risks of intervention, they
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some extent we've created an interest because of all the
talk of American and NATO credibility,'' said Richard Haass,
director of foreign-policy studies at the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who welcomed Clinton's decision, the notion that the
latest Balkan flare-up could spread only underscored the fact that
America had to be prepared to quell ethnic brush fires early,
before they became conflagrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the end of the Cold War, America still has strategic
interests in Europe,'' said Richard Holbrooke, the
representative-designate to the United Nations, who was
instrumental in negotiating the peace agreement in Bosnia. ``When
people boast that we're the only remaining superpower, they have to
recognize that this fact implies obligations and responsibilities
as well as opportunities. It took us four years to get our act
together in Bosnia, and when we finally did, belatedly and
reluctantly, it was decisive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dilemma for the United States now is that we face a choice
in places like Kosovo between a relatively early involvement, by
which to prevent worse tragedy, or a more costly involvement later,
after tragedies even greater than those we've already seen.
Americans are understandably reluctant to do this, and it is
incumbent on the administration to make the case to Congress and
the American public. Skepticism is justified, but leadership is
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   For those prepared to see the United States assume a policing
role in the world, one troubling question is how to select crises
in which to get involved. Why, for example, is it reasonable for
U.S. forces to go to the Balkans, but not to far bloodier places
like Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   The predominant response is that Americans simply can not go to
every crisis, that there are limits to what the public will accept,
and that different crises pose different degrees of danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a question I have struggled with for a long time,'' said
Lawrence Eagleburger, a former secretary of state.
``Geographically, Rwanda and Burundi are much harder to deal with,
and to put it bluntly, in contrast with Kosovo, they are a
distinctly different level of threat. Kosovo is not only in Europe,
but could engage other members of NATO, Greece and Turkey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Having said that,'' he added, ``it's hard to ignore that tens
and hundreds of thousands of people are getting killed'' in ethnic
conflicts around the world.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Haass, who worked on the National Security Council for the Bush
administration, said the United States has to assess crises one at
a time. It has to ``ask about stakes, but also whether we can
devise an intervention that can accomplish some good, at a cost
that doesn't outrun the stakes.'' In Kosovo, he said, ``arguably we
can.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet more broadly, he said the United States has to accept that
its history and power vests it not only with strategic
responsibilities, but also with moral obligations. ``Part of what
makes a great power great is its willingness to put itself on the
line even when vital interests are not involved,'' he said. ``In
some ways this is about trying to promote our vision of order. It's
something we choose to do, not have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If it looks like the Americans and Europeans can stop the
fighting in Kosovo at a reasonable cost, and they don't, it creates
a kind of ethical vacuum, it ultimately breeds a kind of cynicism
that nothing matters,'' said Leslie Gelb, president of the Council
on Foreign Relations and a former columnist for The New York Times.
``Nobody wants to be a policeman of the world, but unless we carry
out some police activity, it undermines all the protestations that
we believe in something.''
</P>
<P>
   This, he said, is probably the most important issue facing
American foreign policy. Yet the debate on ethnic and civil wars,
he lamented, ``was a debate in a teacup of foreign-policy wonks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You look for an answer from the leadership, and if you don't
see it, you don't support intervention,'' Gelb said. That, he
added, was the problem with Clinton's announcement on Kosovo _ the
decision was correct, but it was neither properly prepared nor
properly explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president really hasn't sparked such debate, and his
statement just doesn't give full justification for sending
troops,'' Gelb said.

PRESIDENT AND FIRST LADY MARK VALENTINE'S DAY WITH GIFTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   MERIDA, Mexico _ President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton
put their mutual affections on public display Sunday by seeking out
reporters aboard Air Force One to offer Valentine's Day wishes and
show off a gold-colored, heart-shaped pin that the president gave
his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The first couple's visit with reporters aboard the presidential
aircraft was so unusual after months of arms length dealings during
the impeachment fight that reporters aboard the plane telephoned
reports of the rendezvous to news organizations back in Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The couple appeared in the press cabin shortly after takeoff to
pass out chocolate candy from a large heart-shaped box.
</P>
<P>
   ``Happy Valentine's Day,'' the president said. ``Isn't this the
biggest heart you ever saw in your life? This is a better kind of
heart of darkness.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heart of Darkness,'' written by the 19th century writer Joseph
Conrad, chronicled the ill-effects of heat, deprivation and
isolation on a 19th century European colonist in Africa, leading to
the colonist's eventual breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton was wearing a gold-colored pin shaped like a heart
on her dark suit. Asked if the jewelry was new, Mrs. Clinton
replied: ``Brand new.'' She then pointed toward her husband and
smiled.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton said the box of candy was a gift from one of her
brothers. Her brothers, Tony Rodham and Hugh Rodham, her mother
Dorothy Rodham, and her nephew Zack Rodham, joined the Clintons at
the White House last week during the climax of the impeachment
struggle.
</P>
<P>
   The president and Mrs. Clinton made their way quickly through
the press compartment at the rear of the specially equipped Boeing
747 jumbo jet to distribute holiday candy to passengers in other
parts of the 75-seat plane.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons' trip to Mexico on Valentine's Day meant a return
to the country where they spent their honeymoon in 1975. Then, they
vacationed in Acapulco on the Pacific coast of Mexico after their
wedding in Fayetteville, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons arrived here on the Yucatan peninsula late Sunday.
The president began private meetings with Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo, Mexican government officials and some opposition members
of parliament during a 23-hour visit taking place two days after
the Senate acquitted Clinton on impeachment charges.

<P>
   Clinton administration officials have already signaled that the
White House will seek to ease the greatest tension in U.S.-Mexican
relations by certifying to the U.S. Congress that Mexico continues
to cooperate with joint counternarcotics' efforts. The deadline for
the annual certification is March 1.
</P>
<P>
   National Security Adviser Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger said
recertification would ``receive a great deal of attention'' during
the summit, adding that U.S. officials will look at the extent of
cooperation ``fairly, without either inventing or inflating
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger, tipping the president's hand, added: ``It's important to
remember what the purpose of certification is and what it is not.
It is not to measure the extent of Mexico's problems. It's intended
to assess the extent of its cooperation with us in overcoming
them.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials cited a variety of milestones underscoring
Mexican progress, including Mexico's announcement on Feb. 4 of
``total war'' against narcotics trafficking, with $400 million in
new spending to buy ships, aircraft, radar, X-ray equipment and
other equipment.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials also pointed to Mexico's steps criminalizing
money laundering by requiring reporting for cash transfers of more
than $10,000, tighter screening of an elite antidrug force to weed
out endemic corruption and extraditing U.S.-sought drug dealers to
the United States for trial.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials estimate that 70 percent of illegal narcotics
smuggled into the United States cross the U.S.-Mexican border.
Mexican authorities point to Americans' consumption of cocaine and
marijuana as an equal source of the international drug challenge.
</P>
<P>
   A loss of White House certification would cost Mexico millions
of dollars in U.S. assistance. Three presidents have certified
Mexican cooperation with antidrug efforts over the 12-year period
since Congress mandated the annual review.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo is ``clearly trying to establish a clean government and
respect for the rule of law,'' Berger told reporters last week.
``He has described drugs as the number one national security threat
to Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   The scope of corruption has been revealed largely because of
``Mexico's own efforts to uproot it,'' Berger added.
</P>
<P>
   James Dobbins, the National Security Council's senior director
for Inter-American Affairs, said, that U.S.-Mexico cooperation has
``made a lot of progress over the last year.''

<P>
   White House officials said they expected Mrs. Clinton to strike
a higher profile now that her husband's impeachment trial is over
on charges stemming from a sex-and-cover-up scandal involving
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is weighing whether to seek the Democratic
nomination for the U.S. Senate seat in New York being vacated by
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   White House Chief of Staff John Podesta, appearing on ABC News'
``This Week'' on Sunday, said that a number of people ``have been
really urging her to run, and I think she wants to hear them out.''
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan told questioners on NBC News' ``Meet the Press'' that
Mrs. Clinton would be ``welcome and she'd win.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL SULLIVAN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
SALT LAKE CITY _ She has seen the future, and it looks awfully
familiar.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A fresh, young face. A look of wonder in the eyes. And all those
reporters buzzing around, ready to anoint the new kid as figure
skating's next great thing.
</P>
<P>
   Been there, done that, Michelle Kwan says amiably enough. And if
somebody new makes for a bigger crowd and sharper elbows around the
medal podium well, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember skating next to Nancy (Kerrigan) in 1994,'' Kwan,
just 13 back then, said Saturday night after claiming her third
United States Figure Skating Association championship. ``I was in
awe, definitely.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the room, another 13-year-old was soaking it all in, much
as Kwan had done five years earlier as an Olympic alternate for the
Lillehammer Games. Naomi Nari Nam won't go to next month's world
championships _ the U.S. runner-up is too young, of all things _
but she has made her presence felt.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's good,'' Kwan said. ``I admire her.''
</P>
<P>
   Kwan should appreciate the work in progress. Part of Nam's
development, as it turns out, is the result of some tips by an old
hand. For the past three years, Nam has spent weekends at Lake
Arrowhead, Calif., where Kwan trains.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to help her,'' Kwan said. ``When you see a little girl
struggling with her jumps ''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Nam isn't quite so little or struggling so much.
Kwan was the class of the field and a clear winner Saturday night,
but Nam was pretty good, too. As such, a competition that opened as
a one-woman show produced some intrigue after all.
</P>
<P>
   The rivalry isn't of Kwan-Tara Lipinski proportions just yet,
but in figure skating, things change quickly. Kwan has detected a
few indications it might no longer be lonely at the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see it in their eyes, if they have it,'' she said. ``She
definitely has it in her.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean Kwan, who plans to attend college next year on
at least a limited basis, is ready to step aside at the ripe old
age of 18. The appearance of a potential rival might be a good
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone's better, they're better, right?'' coach Frank
Carroll said. ``It's up to us to be better. I think it's a
positive. It keeps you improving.''
</P>
<P>
   For the long-term outlook, Nam's emergence might have been the
best bit of news to emerge from a largely dreary week at the figs.
Better skating has been seen during an Aeros penalty kill, and
prospects for next month's worlds appear bleak.
</P>
<P>
   Kwan, of course, is the defending champion and will be favored
to win again, but Nam's ineligibility leaves the United States
sending the Nos. 3 and 4 skaters from a thin field to face the
world in Helsinki. Neither Angela Nikodinov nor Sarah Hughes
appears ready for that just yet, though the 13-year-old Hughes (who
goes, despite her age, as a result of a second-place finish in
junior worlds this year) might benefit from the experience.
</P>
<P>
   Among the men, prospects are more tenuous. Michael Weiss, who
won his first U.S. championship here, is the best hope, but his
international background is spotty. Weiss was seventh in the 1998
Olympics and sixth at last year's world championships. The prestige
of being the top American might get him some benefit of the doubt,
but Weiss must perform at a level he has yet to reach if he is to
medal in Finland.
</P>
<P>
   More is at stake than image and bragging rights. In order to
keep three spots in the following year's worlds, the top two
skaters must combine for no more than 13 placement positions. For
instance, if Weiss were to come in third, one of the other two men
_ Trifun Zivanovic or Timothy Goebel _ would have to finish 10th or
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm going with the idea of protecting our spot,'' said
Goebel, who didn't inspire confidence by falling twice in his long
program here. ``I think we can do it, too. I feel good about our
chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Protecting positions in the field is the immediate concern, but
figure-skating eyes are beginning to sneak a peek at 2002, when
America's attention again will focus on an Olympic season.
</P>
<P>
   Will Kwan be there? That's her plan at the moment, but three
years is a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I still have that flame burning inside, I'll be here,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll isn't sure, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she wants to do it, she can do it,'' he said. ``It won't be
up to me or her parents or anyone else. Whether she stays in it
will be totally up to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Nam might actually help in that regard. Skating insiders
wondered if boredom might overtake Kwan in the absence of a
Lipinski to motivate her. The idea of being pushed aside by another
young up-and-comer might stir the competitive juices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it helps having somebody close by,'' Kwan said. ``I
already know that people are out there. You can't let anything go.
You have to keep improving, or you're going to stop and people are
going to pass you.''
</P>
<P>
   The impetus might have arrived in the form of a diminutive
fellow Californian even Kwan calls ``cute.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to see how this little girl develops,'' Carroll said.
``She has a lot to go yet, but she's darling, and she has the
talent.''
</P>
<P>
   So it appears. And just like that, the road to 2002 got a little
more interesting.

BOBBY VALENTINE: THE MAN WHO KNOWS EVERYTHING EXCEPT THE WORDS `NO
COMMENT'  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
( ATTN:   Conn., Mo. Ga., Texas)  By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. _ Strolling into Bobby Valentine's Sports
Gallery Cafe here is like opening a gigantic scrapbook of his life.
There are newspaper clippings about a national dance competition he
won at 13, about how he consumed 120 pancakes in college to win
another contest and, of course, about his accomplishments as a
major league baseball player, including frame-by-frame shots of him
crashing into a center-field fence and fracturing his right leg
and, ultimately, his career.
</P>
<P>
   In the bar, where the walls are adorned with sports magazine
covers, there is a shrine to Valentine's high school football
exploits. Encased in a glass frame are about two dozen recruiting
letters that the running back at Rippowam High School received from
the top college football teams in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine is a hero here. That is especially true in this
restaurant, where waiters and waitresses wear Mets jerseys bearing
Valentine's No. 2, pictures of Valentine are everywhere and,
periodically, Valentine himself is there as owner, ambassador and
manager. He is always a manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great day, isn't it?'' he gushed as he sat in a
corner booth beneath an autographed Stan Musial jersey recently.
``I love days where I've got a lot to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine likes to be busy and he likes to be liked, and he
found both work and love here.
</P>
<P>
   No one in the restaurant asked if Valentine had anything to do
with the dismissal of the Mets announcer Tim McCarver this month.
If there were comments about it, they were simply to reiterate
Valentine's opinion that the theory was ludicrous.
</P>
<P>
   No one asked about Valentine's poor relationship with Todd
Hundley. If there were observations offered about it, they were
made on the side of the man known here as Boss.
</P>
<P>
   No one questioned why he used Mel Rojas against Paul O'Neill,
who subsequently hit a three-run homer, last June, and it would be
hard to find anyone here who believes that he glared at the press
box after the left-hander Bill Pulsipher allowed a hit to O'Neill
the next day.
</P>
<P>
   This is home, and Valentine is temporarily away from Flushing,
Queens, and the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thrown into the middle of everything that happens,''
Valentine said. ``I don't think that's where I am. I'm a manager. I
care about everything that is involved with my group. I accept
rather than control.''
</P>
<P>
   The tanned Valentine was relaxed on this day. He feigned a frown
when asked some personal questions, but then freely discussed what
he called the misconceptions about him, about his inability to
muzzle himself and about his failure to reach the post-season in
1,541 games as a manager. As confident as Valentine is _ and he is
extremely confident as he approaches his third full season as the
Mets' manager _ a smidgen of insecurity is evident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to speculate, but there are people who have
decided that they have worked too hard at trying to make me look
how they want me to look,'' he said. ``I don't know why they waste
time doing it. I'm not the greatest guy in the world or an angel,
and I'm not the worst guy in the world or the devil. It's better to
write the bad side because the good side is not news. I understand
it and it's confusing. I'm trying to figure that out.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Leiter is also trying to figure it out. He said he was
guarded when the Marlins traded him to the Mets because Kevin
Brown, who played under Valentine in Texas, warned him that the
manager ignored slumping players. But Leiter said he had not
witnessed ``the bad stuff'' he had heard about and called it ``a
complete joy'' to play for Valentine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where Bobby gets a bad rap is people don't know him and he
doesn't let them into his world,'' Leiter said. ``There are worse
managers than him, believe me. I told him that he needs to hire a
p.r. firm. Something's not right. He's not getting his message out.
Some people don't like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to figure Valentine out is a pastime of many people in
and around baseball. Even Valentine acknowledges he can be
confusing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some people he doesn't like, and some people who
don't like him,'' said Joe Valentine, Bobby's father, a retired
carpenter. ``You live with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Valentine is a complex man who is designing two computer
Web sites and is comfortable calling for the hit-and-run with a
pitcher batting. He has a brilliant baseball mind and is eager to
mold the new-look Mets and surpass last season's victory total of
88, but the 48-year-old with the graying hair and nonstop smile is
often one comment or curious action away from obscuring what his
well-prepared teams do.
</P>
<P>
   Even Valentine conceded there had been six to eight incidents
that had tarnished his two-plus seasons with the Mets. Whenever
anything occurs with the Mets these days, there is a tendency to
wonder what role Valentine played in it
</P>
<P>
   Did he help get McCarver banished as a Mets announcer after 16
years? Why did Valentine ever publicly discuss Hundley's sleeping
and drinking habits? Did he undermine Joe McIlvaine, the former
general manager whose exit he discussed with reporters before the
news conference to announce it? Some angst could have been avoided
if Valentine had kept quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, I wish I had the `no comment' in me,'' Valentine
said. ``It's probably a character flaw. My teachers and friends
will tell you I like to contribute. I don't have `no comment' in me
often. That's a problem. Sometimes that becomes a know-it-all
situation. And maybe I am a bit of a know-it-all when it comes to
those conversations.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Wilpon, who praised Valentine's intelligence, preparation skills
and teaching abilities, said: ``I've had conversations with him
right after he didn't use the edit button. I've told him, `You have
to take one or two more seconds before you answer.' He understands.
He can't always do it because he's under pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley, who became ensnared in an ugly battle with Valentine
after the manager criticized his sleeping patterns during a session
with reporters in 1997, chuckled when asked specifics about their
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to let that ridiculous relationship we had go
with me to L.A.,'' said Hundley, who was traded to the Dodgers in
December. ``I don't know if it's a grudge, but I won't forget what
happened soon. But I'm not going to let him play in my world at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine said he did not badger Hundley about the issue and
added, ``I didn't think it was a big thing when it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine can be engaging and regale his listeners with
interesting stories, but he can be abrupt with reporters who are
unprepared and he especially does not like to be second-guessed.
His disenchantment with McCarver's critiques were well known, but
Valentine called talk of a rift between the two gossip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the McCarver thing epitomized me being put into
something and even reached the level that it could now be going
downhill,'' Valentine said. ``It's so ridiculous. Maybe now people
will say this stuff has gone too far.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs that thing you tell your children, `When you get mad,
count to five, take a deep breath,''' said Tom Grieve, the former
Texas Rangers general manager who lives a few houses from
Valentine's off-season home in Arlington, Texas, and still
considers Valentine a friend even though he fired him as manager in
1992. ``There have been times where you say to yourself, `I hope he
didn't say that.' If he did, I wish he'd thought before he said it.
You don't need to say it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Valentine sometimes says it and sometimes regrets it,
although he emphasized that most of his miscues had quickly blown
over. While the Hundley soap opera stretched on for more than a
year and his dispute with former Mets pitcher Pete Harnisch also
lasted for a while, Valentine said he publicly criticized McCarver
only once, that his dispute with a fan behind the dugout last year
lasted only a few minutes and that his glare at the press box last
season lasted only a moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely, I blame myself, probably for every one of them,''
Valentine said. ``All of those things, I wish I didn't do them. But
how the heck do you do that? There's a real high standard set when
I deal with the press. I have no protection. I get frustrated when
nothing is allowed to slip. Don't be human and have any emotions
going when you talk. I understand it. I'm not complaining because I
don't expect it to change. Just don't ever mess up.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine cannot mess up this year. Not after the Mets invested
$164 million to retain Leiter, catcher Mike Piazza and reliever
Dennis Cook and to sign third baseman Robin Ventura and outfielder
Rickey Henderson. But Valentine, who has a career record of 769-772
and a 188-167 mark with the Mets, lighted up when he was asked
about shaping this Mets team.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I do best is teach,'' Valentine said. ``I
love it. I know it. I will go toe to toe with anyone in the world
on what really happens when you play the game. I can sit on that
panel. People get upset when I say that, but I have a master's in
baseball. I've been educated by the best. The things I didn't know
I went out to find out.''
</P>
<P>
   Grieve agreed, saying: ``I played for Joe Torre, Ted Williams,
Billy Martin and Whitey Herzog, and, when it comes to knowing
different facets of the game inside out and having an overall grasp
of baseball, no one is better than Bobby. I don't think anyone else
is close.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Valentine's confidence can be construed as arrogance.
Valentine said he knew that St. Louis Cardinals Manager Tony La
Russa did not like him, but added that he could care less. Atlanta
Braves Manager Bobby Cox compared defeating Valentine to defeating
the Hall of Fame managers Casey Stengel and John McGraw last year,
but Valentine said he considered the comments competitive, not
sarcastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bobby doesn't like me, he's a phony because he makes like
he's my good friend every time I'm with him,'' Valentine said. ``If
there's a reason he doesn't like me, he should have let me know a
long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Mets win, Valentine will be praised. But if the Mets
sputter, there will be heightened scrutiny on a manager who is
already in the glare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would much rather have a litany of things, 50 times when I
looked up at the press box, 50 quotes about Tim McCarver,
documented run-ins with all these players I supposedly didn't want,
than a little one-liner here and a little glance there,'' he said.
``I wish I didn't do all those things. There's no doubt about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine paused. Unable to resist, he added, ``It would only
mean that I'm doing better than I'm capable of doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine stopped speaking, letting his last remark sink in.

 &HT;    FIRST LOVEBIRDS FLY TO MEXICO
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MERIDA, Mexico _ President Clinton, romancing the press with
chocolates and the first lady with gold on Valentine's Day, sought
a post-impeachment thaw in relations strained by a year of scandal.
</P>
<P>
   En route from Washington aboard Air Force One to a presidential
summit with Mexican leaders, the Clintons made a rare appearance
Sunday in the press cabin, where the president passed out
chocolates from a large heart-shaped box.
</P>
<P>
   ``Happy Valentine's Day,'' Clinton said to a dozen astonished
reporters and photographers. ``Isn't this the biggest heart you
ever saw in your life?''
</P>
<P>
   Backing the rhetoric of reconciliation with a symbol of romance
rekindled, the first couple showed off Clinton's Valentine's
present to his wife: a heart-shaped gold pin.
</P>
<P>
   ''Brand new,'' Hillary Rodham Clinton beamed when reporters
asked about the pin. Then she pointed to her husband and smiled.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has sentimental symbolism for the first couple. They
honeymooned in the resort city of Acapulco after their 1975
wedding.
</P>
<P>
   The chocolates were a gift to Mrs. Clinton, but not from her
husband. They came from her brother, Hugh Rodham, said White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons' appearance in the press cabin was a surprise.
During a year dominated by Clinton's sex-and-deception scandal, he
has assiduously avoided reporters, including those traveling with
him aboard the presidential aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   After his effort to sweeten relations with a sometimes sour
press corps, Clinton quickly retired to his cabin, leaving
reporters to wonder whether he might be intending more regular
contacts with the media after being acquitted of impeachment
charges in the Senate on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's next scheduled press conference is Friday, when he
meets at the White House with President Jacques Chirac of France.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons arrived in this city on the Yucatan Peninsula on
Sunday night, greeted by President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico and
his wife, Nilda Patricia Velasco, as the national anthems of both
countries played.
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards, the Zedillos played host at a dinner for the
Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   Monday will be devoted to meetings on anti-narcotics efforts,
trade and environmental issues. Clinton is scheduled to return to
Washington on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has two weeks in which to certify to
Congress that Mexico is fully cooperating with U.S. efforts to stop
the flow of illicit narcotics northward into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Decertification would trigger reductions in U.S. aid that could
damage the fragile economy in Mexico, the second-largest U.S.
trading partner behind Canada.
</P>
<P>
   While Mexico remains the largest trans-shipment point for
cocaine destined for the United States, the Clinton administration
has already begun making the case for certifying Mexico's
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president has not made a decision,'' national security
adviser Samuel Berger told reporters Friday. ''We will look to the
extent of the cooperation between us. We'll look to it fairly
without either inventing or inflating progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger stressed, though, that the administration is more
interested in encouraging progress in Mexico than in punishing
failure.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, this is a tremendous problem for Mexico, but one
that they are tackling head-on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's important to remember what the purpose of certification
is, and what it is not,'' said Berger. ''It is not to measure the
extent of Mexico's problems. It's intended to assess the extent of
its cooperation with us in overcoming them.''

NEW ANGEL VAUGHN MAKES COMMITMENT TO CHILDREN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kim Courtemarche used to live in the neighborhood that surrounds
Boston's Fenway Park. From her apartment, she could see the Fenway
Park scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   But there were parts of every game when she didn't have to go to
the window to find out who was batting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could hear the crowd chanting `Mo, Mo, Mo,' '' she said.
``He was a hero there.''
</P>
<P>
   Many players across the country have their names chanted at
ballparks, but that hardly makes them worthy of hero status.
Maurice ``Mo'' Vaughn, however, was just that to many in Boston. He
was arguably the city's most popular player since Ted Williams.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't so much that Vaughn was the American League's Most
Valuable Player in 1995, or that he averaged 36 home runs and 111
RBIs in his past six seasons, or that he has a .304 lifetime
average covering eight years in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   It had more to do with Vaughn's roots in the city and his desire
to make a difference in the lives of children.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn was born and raised in Norwalk, Conn., and was sent to
Trinity-Pawling, a private boarding school near the New
York-Connecticut border, during high school. He was a three-time
All-American at Seton Hall and has a home in Easton, Mass. Before
signing with the Angels the day before last Thanksgiving, he had
played his entire career in the Red Sox organization.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, 31, is flashy and flamboyant. He stands 6-foot-1 and
weighs 240 pounds. He wears expensive jewelry, including a ring
that spells out his jersey number, 42, in diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   But Vaughn has a heart for helping children, and he wears it on
his sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of former Dodger Mike Piazza made sure to call
the Los Angeles media whenever the catcher made a visit to
Children's Hospital. In contrast, Vaughn quietly began working with
area children on the bottom floor of an ordinary brick building in
Dorchester, Mass., five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn started the Mo Vaughn Youth Development Program in 1994,
based in Dorchester, not far from his home in Easton. He hired a
couple of his childhood friends to help run it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents worked with kids a long time, so I've been involved
even before I got to the major league level,'' Vaughn said. ``You
feel kids out. Working with young kids, you're seeing their
reactions. You find out if you have the ability to make a
difference. If you don't have the ability to communicate, you won't
be able to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The seven original kids are about to go to college,'' Vaughn
said of his program's original students. ``We've touched hundreds
of kids. ... It's nice, but it's a long road.''
</P>
<P>
   LONG ROAD TO ANAHEIM
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 25, the Angels announced they had signed Vaughn to a
six-year, $80 million contract. At the time, his $13.3 million
average annual salary was the highest in baseball history. Since
then, Kevin Brown's seven-year, $105 million deal with the Dodgers
-- averaging $15 million per season -- has surpassed Vaughn's.
</P>
<P>
   But Vaughn's commitment to children began long before he was
making millions as a professional baseball player. One might even
say it's in his blood.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn's parents, Leroy and Shirley, were teachers. Leroy also
was a high school football coach and later became a principal. They
know the value of education, and instilled that in Vaughn from an
early age.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn learned discipline and order from other teachers, those
at Trinity-Pawling. Everything -- from breakfast to study hall
after dinner -- was carried out by the book. Classes were held six
days a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as I hated it in the beginning, it was a stepping
stone in my life,'' Vaughn said. ``I had to learn to live with
other people. We would eat, sleep, go to class together, living in
a dorm situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living with people, you abide by the rules, and you also
execute your own rules. I was doing that at 15, 16 years old. So by
the time I went to college, I was already prepared. It's why I did
so well my freshman year (at Seton Hall). And in the minor leagues,
riding buses ... well, I had already been riding buses. I had
already learned to take care of myself.''
</P>
<P>
   THE MAJORS CAN WAIT
</P>
<P>
   Education obviously has been as important as anything in
Vaughn's life. It continued at Seton Hall after his graduation from
Trinity-Pawling.
</P>
<P>
   At Seton Hall, Vaughn decided to focus on baseball after also
having played football and basketball in high school. He enjoyed a
stellar three years, being named an All-American three times and
being voted the Big East Conference player of the decade. And he
can thank his mother for insisting on college.
</P>
<P>
   The Vaughns received a phone call from the Phillies during Mo's
senior year at Trinity-Pawling. It was Vaughn's mother who took the
call, but instead of negotiating a big-money signing bonus, she
told them not to bother drafting him -- he was going to college.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn didn't learn of the phone call until years later, but
doesn't hold it against his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never miss what I never had,'' he said. ``The way my mom
looked at it was if I was a third-round pick at 18, at 21 I'd be a
first-round pick. Plus, I got three more years of education. I'm
glad it worked out that way.''
</P>
<P>
   YES SIR, NO SIR
</P>
<P>
   There were a couple of men who had as much influence on Vaughn
early in his life as anybody, other than his parents. One was Miles
Hubbard, the athletic director and basketball coach at
Trinity-Pawling. The other was Mike Sheppard, Seton Hall's baseball
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my coaches had a great influence on me,'' Vaughn said.
``(Hubbard) taught me the importance of knowing there was an
academic side and an athletic side, and it took a lot of effort to
succeed in both. He told me the difference between doing the right
thing and the wrong thing might only take five more minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sheppard, he's an ex-Marine. He believed you don't make
excuses for whatever went wrong. He believed if he hammered you
long enough, it would make you a better player. He didn't want you
to like him, he wanted you to respect him. You played so hard
because you didn't want to hear his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he made me understand that no matter what level you're at,
guys still need to be led.''
</P>
<P>
   LEADER OF THE PACK
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn has been a leader on every athletic team he's ever played
for. Many of his Red Sox teammates felt Vaughn was the one player
they could not afford to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, voiced their feelings
publicly during negotiations between Vaughn and the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Vaughn is about to step into the Angels clubhouse as the
new guy. But he already commands respect. The Angels have been
waiting for someone like him.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times you get guys in here and you hear their voices,
but it turns out to be nothing but hot air,'' said veteran Angels
pitcher Chuck Finley. ``But Mo is somebody who goes out and does
what he says. The last three or four years, we've been one key
player away from going to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you don't know how good you can be. And it doesn't
show until somebody like Mo says he wants to play for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn said being a leader simply is part of who he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``You watch other players and it comes because you care about
other people,'' he said. ``When I first came up in the big leagues,
young players didn't get a lot of attention from veteran players.
So I do what I can because I remember what it was like when I was
young.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a leader all my life. I don't know how it
transpired, it just has. I want to make my team believe it can be
as good as anybody, and can beat any team. I'm going to make the
Angels believe because we are a very, very talented team.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I walk onto the field in spring training on Day One,
people are going to know we are the team to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels general manager Bill Bavasi said he has admired Vaughn
since Vaughn became a big leaguer in 1991. When Vaughn became
available, he became the Angels' first choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we embarked on the offseason, we wanted to make sure we
were real specific on the type of player we were trying to
pursue,'' Bavasi said. ``We felt the club was good enough to where
only the best would do. We feel we've done that.''
</P>
<P>
   A NEW CHAPTER
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn repeatedly has said he is excited about turning the page
in his career and in his life. He has purchased a home in the
Newport Beach area and plans to get involved in community programs
in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Vaughn really didn't have a choice. He said he felt
slighted when the Red Sox told him they couldn't improve on a
three-year, $30 million contract extension the two sides were
negotiating following the 1997 season, then turned around and
signed pitcher Pedro Martinez for $75 million.
</P>
<P>
   He also didn't feel the Red Sox supported him off the field.
When Vaughn was arrested for drunk driving in January of 1998, no
Red Sox representatives attended his trial, at which a jury found
Vaughn not guilty. But when Red Sox infielder Wil Cordero went to
trial on charges of spousal abuse, the team sent several
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy I made the decision I made,'' Vaughn said. ``I've
played eight years in the big leagues and I love playing baseball.
If I stayed there six or seven more years, I would have left the
game angry and I didn't deserve that. It was time to make a move.
Now, when I leave the game, I'll leave with a smile on my face.''
</P>
<P>
   EVERYONE LOVES A WINNER
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn expects to enjoy Southern California after spending his
entire life on the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's going to be different,'' he said. ``But what's got
to be understood is that the baseball situation is what it's all
about. If we play well, it'll be great. If we play poorly, I'll be
disgusted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's a different mentality out there than in Boston.
But I'm happy about it.''
</P>
<P>
   California's laid-back reputation won't bother Vaughn, unless it
creeps into the Angels' clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I see a time to keep the positive things rolling, I'll
make sure they keep rolling,'' he said. ``I want to help the team
play with the right intensity. I might put up numbers, but I don't
know what they're going to be. I was fortunate enough to be the MVP
in '95 and start an All-Star game. But the biggest asset I bring to
a team is to keep the team concept rolling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nomar (a Whittier native) said it's laid back out there. Well,
maybe we've got to up the tempo.''

   HISTORY OF BAD BLOOD HARDENS POSITION OF PILOTS
</P>
<P>
   Airline pilots, some of America's best-paid and most highly
respected workers, have become among the nation's most militant, in
part because of the central role that they play in the airline
industry and the past scorched-earth labor policies of executives
at major airlines.
</P>
<P>
   But just as important are their character traits. Pilots both
individually and as a group often exhibit a self-confidence that
some industry executives say borders on arrogance. For decades,
many of them have felt they have been exploited by the airlines.
</P>
<P>
   BACK TO WORK
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines pilots returned to work in greater numbers.

   SLATE BECOMES FREE AGAIN
</P>
<P>
   Ten months after deciding to charge readers $19.95 a year, the
publisher of Slate, the online magazine owned by Microsoft,
announced in an e-mail to subscribers that it would now be free.
The publisher cited the dynamic growth of advertising on the Web
and the slow pace of paid subscriptions for content.

 &HT;    Gordon not intimidated
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ The 1999 NASCAR season started much like
the way last year's ended: With two-time defending Winston Cup
champion Jeff Gordon in victory lane.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Gordon became the seventh driver to win more than one
Daytona 500, holding off a furious threat from defending champion
Dale Earnhardt in one of the most thrilling finishes in the 41-year
history of the Great American Race.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, the '97 Daytona 500 winner, collected more than $2.1
million in winnings, which includes a $1 million Winston ``No Bull
5'' bonus. It was Gordon's third straight victory dating back to
last season, and his 21st consecutive top-10 finish in points
events.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who led only 17 of 200 laps in the race, became the
first driver to win the Daytona 500 from the pole position since
Bill Elliott in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Daytona on the last lap, that's not the kind of black you
want to see,'' Gordon said. ``That black race car can flat get
around here. Dale really had a very strong car all day. Keeping him
behind me was one of the toughest things I've had to do in a race
car. ... That is a dream come true to race Dale down to the final
finish, all the way down to the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt tried to move past Gordon on the final lap, letting up
on the accelerator in turn 4. Earnhardt tried to go inside before
the finish line, but Gordon blocked the move.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt finished second for the fifth time, moving him past
Cale Yarborough on Daytona's all-time list for runner-up finishes.
Kenny Irwin, last year's rookie of the year, was third.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't really muster much on Jeff,'' Earnhardt said. ``His
car was stronger from the center of the corner than mine was. I
just never could get to him. If I could have got to him, I could
have got a bumper under him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Earnhardt didn't get to Gordon until after they passed the
flag stand, where ``The Intimidator'' gave Gordon a shove well
after the checkered flag had dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't pull up beside me,'' Gordon said. ``He drove into
the side of me. I guess he was saying, `If they're going to put
your car into Daytona USA (exhibition where winning cars are
housed), I'm going to leave my mark on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it was Earnhardt who helped Gordon get to the front
of the pack to set up the furious finish. Following a four-lap
caution through the 178th lap, Earnhardt teamed up with Gordon _
and not teammate Mike Skinner _ in drafting to begin their assault
on the team of Rusty Wallace and Jeremy Mayfield, who led all but
32 of the final 143 laps between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty surprised, although I think I had the preferred
line,'' Gordon said. ``I had the bottom groove and the bottom
groove was the way to go all day long. Dale had a tough choice
there. He had a teammate, his buddy Rusty in the middle and me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he would have gone with the other two long before he
went with me, but I think he knew he had a fast race car and he
could race with anybody. Maybe he wanted to race me for the
finish.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened in the final 11 laps. Shortly after the
green flag fell, Gordon and Earnhardt took a wild, daring ride
through the pack, moving up from the eighth and 10th spots,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt passed Mayfield for second place with only 16 laps to
go, catching Wallace's bumper. Earnhardt stayed in Wallace's
rear-view mirror for three more laps, but then Gordon got a push
from Skinner to move into second, with Earnhardt falling to fifth
as they finished lap 188.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get up there with Dale,'' Gordon said. ``It seemed
like once I did, we started making some moves and that's when it
started coming back in my mind. Once we got up there to the leader,
I didn't want to push him past the leader because I knew I'd never
pass him.''
</P>
<P>
   Two laps later, only 11 laps from the finish, Gordon made a
daring move to pass Wallace. Toward the first turn, Gordon went
inside Wallace on the apron and squeezed past the lapped car of
Ricky Rudd at nearly 190 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner then moved next to Wallace on the outside and the cars
moved side by side into turn 3. Gordon finally took the lead at the
flag stand, with Wallace and Skinner trailing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gordon just got me on the apron down there,'' Wallace said.
``I couldn't block him off enough. I thought I had him blocked off,
but he kept on going. I thought he was going to run right in the
back of Rudd on the apron. I had him pinned down there, but I
wasn't going to try to wreck a bunch of cars. I pulled up and he
got me, but I just didn't think I'd get freight-trained that
badly.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, who led more than half of the race, got squeezed out of
the front draft and finished eighth. He is now winless in 17 career
starts in the Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one probably hurts the most because I thought I had the
best car,'' Wallace said. ``I'm just so heart-broken that happened.
I can't believe it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt's last hope was getting a push from Skinner, but he
was stuck in fourth behind Irwin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to get some help,'' Earnhardt said.
``(Irwin) and (Skinner) were trying to race each other.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturally, you're a little frustrated,'' Skinner said. ``It's
hard to watch people draft with your opponents instead of your own
team, but that's the way it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt and Skinner weren't the only teammates that struggled
on Sunday. Irwin hit teammate Dale Jarrett in the rear during the
134th lap, causing a 13-car pileup between turns 3 and 4. The
accident knocked Jarrett out of the race after he led 14 of the
first 56 laps. The wreck also eliminated contender Mark Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett, who was running second at the time of the accident,
wouldn't assess blame after the wreck, although television replays
showed Irwin's car made contact with Jarrett's No. 88 Ford.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Irwin) was in the mix there, but I have no idea,'' Jarrett
said. ``He was back there. A couple of cars had passed me coming
off of two and down the backstretch, and I was the guy in the
middle and I was just trying to hold there.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin was apologetic after the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very bad about it,'' he said. ``If I could have made it
not happen, I would have made it not happen. I honestly don't know.
I didn't feel anything.

SENATORS SHIFTING TO ISSUES AND THE 2000 CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With President Clinton's acquittal behind them,
senators of both parties Sunday turned to issues like Social
Security, taxes and foreign policy, while another Republican
announced he was taking steps to seek his party's presidential
nomination next year.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the Senate concluded the trial of the president,
the Sunday morning talk shows were notable for showcasing how eager
the nation's political leaders are to move beyond the impeachment
struggle that consumed Congress for five months. Senators quickly
shifted to the legislative arena and sounded the opening notes of
the policy battles that are likely to shape the presidential and
congressional races in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in particular, who have seen their approval ratings
sink across the past months, worked to show that their party stands
for more than investigating Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very much in the president's interest, and the
country's interest to put the impeachment trial behind us,'' said
Sen. Don Nickles, an Oklahoma Republican who is the majority whip,
in an appearance on ABC's ``This Week.'' ``That's over now, and
let's go on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans have to have an agenda,'' said Sen. Pete V.
Domenici, a New Mexico Republican, appearing on ``Fox News
Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   To drive home the point that they do have an agenda,
congressional Republicans are planning to hold scores of town
meetings during the week-long recess on such issues as Social
Security, Medicare and tax-cutting.
</P>
<P>
   A critical question in the wake of the impeachment struggle is
whether Clinton and Congress can overcome the anger and partisan
bitterness and work together.
</P>
<P>
   John Podesta, the White House chief of staff, said on ABC's
``This Week'' that for the second consecutive day the president
spoke with the congressional leadership about the possible troop
deployment in Kosovo and domestic issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talked about Medicare and Social Security,'' he said,
``how we can get to the table to begin to do the people's
business.'' Podesta also said the president suggested to the new
House speaker, Rep. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, that the two men
meet soon on policy.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, a Democrat who has
often been at odds with Clinton, said on NBC's ``Meet the Press''
Sunday, ``I wouldn't expect a great deal in terms of
presidential-congressional working together, but the Congress could
do a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., both warned that Clinton would
make a mistake if, as part of the Democratic drive to recapture the
House next year, he mounted an all-out political campaign against
those, such as the House managers, who had worked hardest to remove
him from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has opportunities, but he will squander them if there's any
note of vengeance,'' Moynihan said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said, ``We just can't work well together if you know that
they're mounting some kind of specific vengeance-minded program
which is different from the normal electoral cycle we go through.''
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers of both parties did agree on one outcome of
impeachment: that the Independent Counsel Act, which expires this
summer, will be substantially revised or eliminated entirely. The
law, under which Kenneth Starr was commissioned, was passed in the
aftermath of the Watergate scandal to guard against situations like
the so-called Saturday Night Massacre of 1973, when Richard M.
Nixon ordered his attorney general, Elliot Richardson, to fire the
Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox. Richardson resigned
rather than do so.
</P>
<P>
   `This law needs to terminate,'' said Sen. Mitch McConnell, a
Kentucky Republican, on CNN's ``Late Edition.'' ``I don't want it
to be amended. I want it to be ended.''
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan said the law, which created independent counsels, was
``a post-Watergate liberal notion, and it was a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   The two political parties now plan to turn their attention to an
overhaul of the Social Security system, a battle over how to use
federal budget surpluses, education and foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have made a sweeping, across the board tax cut a
centerpiece of their agenda this year while Clinton had advocated a
series of tax credits targeted to specific social purposes.
``Targeted tax credits don't help all the people,' Domenici, the
chairman of the Senate Budget Committee said. ``And they don't help
the economy. An across the board tax cut does both.''
</P>
<P>
   The same theme was struck by Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, the House
Budget Committee chairman, who announced on ``Meet the Press'' that
he would file papers Monday with the Federal Election Commission to
set up a presidential exploratory committee, joining a crowded
field of Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Tax-cutting, he said, ``is about power flowing from the people
rather than running America with a handful of people deciding out
to spend our money, how to plan for our retirement''
</P>
<P>
   In foreign policy, another area where the Republicans want to
highlight their differences with the Democratic president, McCain,
another of the Republican presidential contenders, reluctantly
supported Clinton's decision to send troops to Kosovo. But he
criticized Clinton for failing to prepare the American people for
the deployment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president of the United States a few weeks ago gave an
hour and 17 minute speech to the American people,'' he said on
NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' referring to the State of the Union
message. ``There was one line about Kosovo. The president and his
advisers knew very well that this was a looming crisis, where
people are gouging out other people's eyes, innocent people's eyes,
and we have no exit strategy, we have no concept of how we want to
settle this situation.''

RECENT DECISIONS MAY HURT JETER IN ARBITRATION CASE
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Derek Jeter is scheduled to have his arbitration
hearing here Monday, and recent history may be working against him.
Jeter, the Yankees' ll-star shortstop, is asking for $5 million,
while the Yankees' proposed figure is $3.2 million. Another
shortstop in Jeter's service-time class, Mark Grudzielanek of Los
Angeles, lost his arbitration case and will make $1.9 million,
rather than the $2.6 million he wanted. In fact, the owners have
won all five cases that have gone to arbitration this year. Frank
Casey, who argued two of those cases successfully, will represent
the Yankees on Monday, before a panel of three arbiters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want to say we have a slam-dunk case because
anything can happen,'' one Yankee executive said. ``But we're in a
good position.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, said Sunday that
there had been no contact in recent days between him and Casey
Close, the agent for Jeter. The shortstop made $750,000 last
season, the same as the closer Mariano Rivera, whose arbitration
case will be heard here Wednesday. Rivera is asking for $4.25
million, while the Yankees are offering $3 million; some baseball
officials believe there is a good chance Rivera will settle or even
reach the multiyear agreement that the Yankees have been hinting
about in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Cashman and other Yankees players and officials attended the
Florida State Fair on Sunday, and David Wells was among them. The
pitcher, whose girth has been an issue with the club, ``looks fine
to me,'' Cashman said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I wasn't measuring him up, to be honest, but he
looked like he did to me in October.'' &QL;

IF CRITTERS GOT YOU STEWIN', BON APPETIT!

<TEXT>
<P>
   At Jasper, Alberta, the town pet is the elk. However, local
residents spell it with an ``s'' as in pest.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors are enthusiastically supportive of the resident herds,
which hang around the city parks or dig through the snow to munch
on fairway grass at the Jasper Park Lodge.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to Seattle's Ballard locks used to applaud Herschel the
Sea Lion when he appeared, gulping down a salmon sandwich. Local
fishermen were not amused.
</P>
<P>
   Guess what? The people of Jasper have developed a master plan.
They intend to ship most of the resident elk to Saskatchewan. We
can only hope they will not use the same delivery service that
transported Herschel and friends to California. The sea lions
returned faster than a 250-pound anvil mailed with a two-cent
stamp.
</P>
<P>
   During a typical week, Jasper Park Lodge will play host to
wildlife lovers from Japan, Germany and France; to cross-country
skiers from South Carolina, Hawaii and Virginia; to ice skaters,
ballroom dancers and to Canadian immigrants like those who recently
celebrated the Ukranian New Year in the lodge with a few splashes
of vodka.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, representatives of the Alberta Elk Breeders
Association took over the place. Ground elk antlers are highly
valued in Asia but you didn't have to travel to Bangkok to buy elk
velvet nutritional tablets. They were on sale in the lodge lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are brisk markets for venison and elk skins in
North America, and perhaps the breeders also rent out elk to safe
crackers. A cross-country skier from Corvallis, Ore., claimed elk
had opened the cooler on his cabin deck and consumed almost
everything inside during a late-night refrigerator raid.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, some of us suspected raccoons.
</P>
<P>
   Cabin neighbors with a partiality for gin and tonic were above
suspicion. The only items left by the midnight raiders were two
limes.
</P>
<P>
   My wife and I were treated to close-up views of a wolf, a moose
and a few dozen future residents of Saskatchewan. However, we did
not come away from Jasper with any regional recipes requiring two
limes and a half ton of elk meat.
</P>
<P>
   This alternate recipe is great for venison, beef or buffalo. Who
knows? It might even work with raccoon.
</P>
<P>
   Critter Stew
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds cup flour
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds round steak, in one-inch cubes
</P>
<P>
   2 cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 cups dry red wine
</P>
<P>
   2 cups beef broth
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon dill, crushed
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon marjoram, crushed
</P>
<P>
   2 14-ounce cans artichoke hearts
</P>
<P>
   1 pound fresh mushrooms, sliced
</P>
<P>
   On a sheet of waxed paper combine one-third cup flour, 2
teaspoons salt and one-half teaspoon pepper. Add the meat cubes and
toss with your hands until coated.
</P>
<P>
   In a large skillet or heavy pot heat the oil and brown the meat
cubes on all sides, adding garlic the last 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Pour into the pot the wine, beef broth, dill and marjoram.
Simmer covered 90 minutes or until the meat is tender. Add the
artichoke hearts (drained and quartered) and the mushrooms. Simmer
10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In a small jar mix the remaining flour with one-half cup water.
Shake or stir until you have a smooth paste. Stir this into the
pot, cook another 10 minutes then serve over buttered noodles.
</P>
<P>
   This should feed six to eight.
</P>
<P>
   Ground venison also works well in spicy breakfast sausage. So
does lean ground beef and even ground turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Jalapeno Turkey Patties
</P>
<P>
   1 jalapeno pepper, seeded
</P>
<P>
   One-half small onion
</P>
<P>
   1 large clove garlic
</P>
<P>
   1 pound ground meat
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon chili powder
</P>
<P>
   1 beaten egg or egg substitute
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup dry bread crumbs
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon crumbled sage leaves or 2 tablespoons fresh chopped
sage
</P>
<P>
   Dump the jalapeno pepper, onion and garlic into a food processor
or meat grinder. If you don't have fresh jalapenos, use about 6
slices from a jar of pickled and sliced peppers. Well, don't just
stand there, process, unless you decide to grind.
</P>
<P>
   In a large bowl combine the ground meat and all other
ingredients. Moosh thoroughly with your hands.

CONE WILL BE WATCHED CAREFULLY BY YANKEES' STAFF  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is the best of times for free-agent pitchers.
Kevin Brown won 18 games last season and was rewarded by the
Dodgers with a seven-year, $105 million contract. Randy Johnson
collected 19 victories and negotiated a four-year, $52.4 million
deal with Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   David Cone garnered a league-high 20 victories for the Yankees,
who last year won more games than any team in history. He led the
Yankees in strikeouts, and his ratio of walks to strikeouts was the
best in his 13-year career. But the Yankees offered Cone a
one-year, $8 million contract, and he accepted _ evidence of his
priorities, at age 36, and of the Yankees' wariness about the
condition of Cone's pitching arm, even after his superb season.
</P>
<P>
   Catchers and pitchers report to the Yankees' training camp in
Tampa, Fla., on Wednesday, Cone among them. The Yanks won 114 games
last season, in large part because their starting pitching was the
most consistent in the American League. Their rotation was
responsible for 72.9 percent of the team's innings, the highest
rate in the league. David Wells compiled a career-high 18
victories, Andy Pettitte won 16 games, Orlando Hernandez 12 and
Hideki Irabu 13.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom will tout the Yankees as favorites to
successfully defend their World Series championship. But unless the
Yankees' rotation offers a similar contribution, they will be
vulnerable. Whether the Yankees approach the standards they
established in 1998 will depend almost entirely on how the starting
pitchers respond in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Cone, therefore, will be watched closely by the Yankees' staff.
Again.
</P>
<P>
   They will watch how far he extends his right arm as he throws _
shortening his arm would be to suggest a problem. They will watch
his command, and see if he can throw his fastball past hitters high
in the strike zone, something he was able to do most of last
season, before fading. They will monitor his wellness and, Manager
Joe Torre said recently, reduce his workload if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely going to keep an eye on Cone,'' Torre said.
``But we did last year, because he was coming off surgery. What we
might be looking at this year, depending on how he feels, is maybe
stopping him after five innings or skipping a start.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone pitched effectively in the post-season, no-hitting San
Diego for five innings in Game 3 of the World Series, even when his
fastball lacked energy. But he required extensive treatment for his
final starts, and tired quickly _ and that, Cone understands, is
probably why the Yankees would not give him anything more than a
one-year deal. If he had wanted more, he would have had to sign
elsewhere, with the Mets, Los Angeles or Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Cone has thrown more than 90,000 pitches in his major league
career, accumulating roughly 8,500 tons of force on his shoulder.
He has been willing to take the ball even when his arm has ached
and to pitch on shortened rest, and he has fought to stay on the
mound as long as possible. There will be a time when attrition ends
his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure they are worried about my health,'' Cone said, ``and
I'm sure that's what they were thinking when we negotiated, and I
don't have any problems with that. At this point in my career I'm
willing to take it year by year, and I'm willing to prove myself.
If I can have another good year, then maybe we can talk about
another one-year deal. I have no problems with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point in my career, control over where I wanted to
play is more important than trying to maximize my value on the
free-agent market. It's really important for me to stay where I'm
at. Last year was so good that I just didn't want to give it up,
and I was going to do anything I could to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone believes he tired late last season because he started his
preseason preparation unusually early, as he recovered from
shoulder surgery. Bears and pitchers have similar life cycles: in
the winter, most pitchers are virtually dormant, resting their arms
completely. Cone normally will not touch a baseball from October
until sometime in January, when he will begin tossing lightly.
</P>
<P>
   Leading up to spring training last year, Cone had been throwing
resolutely for two months, wanting to prove to Torre and the
pitching coach, Mel Stottlemyre, that he was healthy and ready to
open the season. ``He was auditioning,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time spring training came around I was way ahead of
schedule, and I was probably peaking too soon, but it was
inevitable because of what I had been through,'' Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   This winter, Cone returned to his normal off-season routine,
relaxing and spending some time on his charitable organization, the
David Cone Foundation. In recognition of his fine season, community
service and return from adversity, he was given the Hutch Award two
weeks ago, named in the memory of Fred Hutchinson, the Cincinnati
manager who died of cancer in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Cone started throwing only a couple of weeks ago, and he has yet
to throw off a mound. ``I'm hoping it'll make a difference to start
a little later, and peak a little later,'' he said. ``I feel good
about being able to get full rest this winter. Right now my arm
feels great _ I haven't really tested it, and I haven't gotten on
the mound and aired it out, but going into spring training I feel
really good about it.''
</P>
<P>
   He has been told that now, more than a year removed from his
surgery, his shoulder may be stronger. That explosive fastball he
had in the warm weather of June and July last season might be
sustained through this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Cone's frustration manifests itself in self-lament. When his
face reddens with anger, when the lines on his face are taut, he
usually is castigating himself. He was discouraged with his slow
start last April, worried in September and disgusted when he nearly
blew a large lead against Cleveland in Game 6 of the AL
Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in February, he is confident. He was one of only four
pitchers to win 20 games last year, held opponents to a .237
batting average _ fourth lowest in the league _ and made more
starts (31) than in any year since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all speculation at this point, but I feel like last year
is still a pretty good indication of what I have left,'' Cone said.
``This year could be just as good or better.'' &QL;

MEXICO'S RULING PARTY WINS ELECTION FOR GOVERNOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Elections authorities in the Mexican state of
Guerrero declared Rene Juarez Cisneros, the governing party's
candidate, the winner of the governor's race in a predawn ceremony
Sunday, formalizing results that have been angrily contested by the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Just after 3:30 Sunday morning, state elections officials
announced the results of the official count. Juarez is the
candidate from the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, the
party of President Ernesto Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   The count gave Juarez 49 percent of the vote, to 47 percent for
the candidate from a left-of-center opposition party, in voting
that took place on Feb. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Felix Salgado Macedonio, the losing candidate, has accused the
governing party of distributing food packages and other gifts to
sway votes during the campaign and on election day. He also
contends that there were suspicious irregularities in the vote
count and has called for statewide protests by his followers.
</P>
<P>
   The divisive election further deepened the rancor between the
governing party and the opposition in Guerrero, a perpetually
troubled, impoverished state that was long ruled by an autocratic
dynasty of governing party stalwarts, the Figueroa family.
</P>
<P>
   At a rally Thursday with at least 10,000 of his followers in
Acapulco, the largest city in the state, Salgado called on Zedillo
to order federal elections appeals court officials to overturn the
result.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the last word,'' Salgado said of the president. ``If he
doesn't act, we are going to tell him we're sorry, but his
candidate, Juarez, is not going to govern in this state.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of Salgado's group, the Party of the Democratic
Revolution, have shown news reporters food, roofing material,
blankets and other items, some emblazoned with the PRI insignia,
which were said to have been doled out to voters during the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition party's refusal to accept the results, as
passionately articulated by its president, Andres Manuel Lopez
Obrador, infuriated governing party leaders. Carlos Rojas, the
governing party's secretary general, said Lopez Obrador had
``resorted to lies to confuse public opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``In his intellectual confusion, Lopez Obrador believes
that democracy only exists when his party wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Governing party leaders did not deny handing out gifts, but they
noted that they are not illegal under Guerrero state laws.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The state elections council gave no explanation for the time it
announced its decision. Salgado was not informed that the
announcement would take place, said Genaro Sotelo, a spokesman for
Salgado's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A squad of 10 armed and uniformed rebels from a small guerrilla
group operating in Guerrero made fleeting appearances on the
streets of several poor suburbs of Acapulco Saturday night,
offering to support popular protests against the governing party.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels did not say what kind of support they would provide.
But in a statement, they sought to clarify that they are separate
from Salgado's party, which has said it will only challenge the
results through unarmed means.

<P>
   RAMBOUILLET, France _ Alternately threatening and cajoling,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright brought the two warring sides
in Kosovo together in talks here for the first time on Sunday but
came away unconvinced that a settlement could be reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not be able to say that the path to agreement is clear
or that success is in sight,'' she said Sunday, before she was
expected to report back to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Empowered with Clinton's pledge of 4,000 U.S. troops to police
an eventual peace settlement in Kosovo, Albright journeyed to Paris
and then to the 14th-century stone chateau 30 miles southwest of
the French capital to try to galvanize the Serbs and Albanians into
reaching an accord this week.
</P>
<P>
   Despite invocations of fond childhood memories as a diplomat's
daughter in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, Albright encountered a
recalcitrant Serbian delegation.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs' ultimate leader, President Slobodan Milosevic of
Yugoslavia, has remained at home. His surrogate and close ally,
President Milan Milutinovic of Serbia, flatly ruled out accepting
NATO troops on his territory _ considered a key part of any accord
_ and seemed impervious to Albright's renewed threats of airstrikes
by the alliance if the Serbs refuse an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic Albanians, who have been fighting for the
independence of Kosovo, a province of southern Serbia, recognized
the plan to offer them autonomy as a ``fair deal,'' Albright said.
But so far, only they seemed ready to sign a peace agreement at the
end of the conference, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Contact Group of six nations _ the United States, four
Western European countries, and Russia _ whose foreign ministers
met in Paris on Sunday to review the negotiations set a deadline of
noon next Saturday for ending the talks.
</P>
<P>
   It was possible that Albright would return before the weekend
deadline, officials said. She would come back for ``closure or a
showdown,'' one said. But it was also highly probable, he added,
that the peace deal would have to be taken by the negotiators
directly to Milosevic in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Albright used a variety of arguments, from the highly personal
to the downright political, to tell Milutinovic why he should
encourage his boss, Milosevic, to accept foreign troops. NATO
envisages a force of some 28,000 troops to enforce an eventual
peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   An aide recounted that she told the Serbs on Sunday: ``I know
you all think that I'm anti-Serb but my father said if he hadn't
been a Czech first, he would want to be a Serb.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright spent part of her childhood in Belgrade, where her
father was a senior Czechoslovak diplomat. But her exhortations,
including remembering a Serbian lullaby, appeared to leave her
listeners unmoved.
</P>
<P>
   Milutinovic, who dropped into the talks two days ago and is
expected to report to Milosevic on Monday, said the Serbs remained
opposed to the imposition of an outside force in Kosovo, the key
element of the peace proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very much against it,'' Milutinovic said in a statement
broadcast on government-controlled Serbian television. ``The
differences boil down to what happens at the end. If an agreement
is reached, who should implement it? We are of the opinion that we
should implement it, that we have the strength do that.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the Russians, traditional allies of the Serbs but
part of the foreign team overseeing the talks, ``are in full
agreement with us'' on the issue of foreign troops. Russia's
foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, was expected at the Rambouillet
talks on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said she stressed to Milutinovic during their meeting
at a Paris hotel that the foreign troops did not represent an
invasion. ``There's a big difference between if troops invade or
are invited,'' she said at a news conference. ``There are many
places in the world where troops are invited to enforce the
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright said she was encouraged by the response from the ethnic
Albanians, in contrast to that of the Serbs. Besides meeting the
16-member delegation, she spoke privately with one of the group,
Hashim Thaci, a leading member of the Kosovo Liberation Army rebel
group that has battled Serbian security forces for almost a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave me every indication that they will be ready to sign
on'' to the peace accord, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats here say that little progress has been made so far in
the talks, where the ethnic Albanians _ representing 90 percent of
Kosovo's estimated population of 2 million _ and 13 Serbian
delegates have been ensconced for the last week.
</P>
<P>
   Progress is likely to remain difficult to assess, because the
final decision rests with Milosevic in his palace in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The brunt of Albright's arguments with the Serbs centered on
Milosevic's opposition to allowing foreign troops in Kosovo, a
province of Serbia. Milosevic and his surrogates argue that foreign
troops represent a breach of sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   In the draft plan that has been presented to both sides at the
talks, Kosovo will become autonomous for three years, with its
future after that undecided.
</P>
<P>
   During the three years, a parliament, a judicial system, police
and other institutions are to be developed. The aim is to give the
ethnic Albanians control over their lives, but also to afford
``protection'' to the minority Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   While their security forces have ruled Kosovo harshly since
Milosevic stripped away the province's autonomy in 1989, ordinary
Serbs in the region say they fear domination by the ethnic
Albanians, who speak a different language, practice a different
religion and live almost entirely separately. The Serbs are
Orthodox, and the Albanians mostly Muslim. The two communities go
to different hospitals, schools, places of worship and
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Albright tried to impress on the Serbs, she said, that national
sovereignty toward the end of the 20th century didn't always mean
what it meant 100 years ago. She cited as an example arms-control
agreements between great powers who decided to cede portions of the
armaments they could produce ``for the greater good.''
</P>
<P>
   The secretary also stressed that if Serbia did not accept an
agreement for autonomy, Kosovo would descend into an even worse war
that the Serbs could not win.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the elegant rooms of the castle, Albright achieved some
measure of success by bringing the leaders of the two delegations
together.
</P>
<P>
   They had not formally met in their seven days of talking, eating
and sleeping inside the chateau. The high point of the face-to-face
encounter, according to an aide who was present, was the offer by
the leader of the ethnic Albanian delegation, Thaci, who turned to
the Serbs and said he wanted to find a way that they could live
together. In reply, one of the Serbian leaders said they would like
to be constructive, the aide recounted.
</P>
<P>
   Because Thaci had been open-minded, Albright took him aside and
encouraged him to think about the example of other militant groups
that had given up their weapons. As a model, she suggested Gerry
Adams, leader of the political wing of the Irish Republican Army,
who had forsworn arms for peaceful leadership, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats have suggested that Milosevic is resisting
foreign troops because it would be a ``humiliation'' for him to
explain allowing outsiders on Serbian soil, particularly in the
province that is at the heart of the Serbian national myth and was
the site of Milosevic's first attempt to keep all Serbs in one
state as the old communist Yugoslavia disintegrated.
</P>
<P>
   But others point out that Milosevic has the ability to explain
anything he wants to his population, particularly through his
control of key media.
</P>
<P>
   On April 23, last year, for example, Milosevic organized a
referendum in which a majority of Serbs agreed that there should be
no foreign interference in the conflict in Kosovo. Less than three
weeks later, the Clinton administration envoy, Richard Holbrooke,
the most prominent foreign mediator, met with Milosevic in Belgrade
to try and get a peace process started.

BIOTECH FIRMS ARE RACING TO HEAL A BROKEN HEART 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - BIOPASS   By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Arthur Kaye lay perfectly still on the surgical bed at the UC San
Francisco Medical Center last week, while cardiologist Tony Chou
threaded a catheter through the clogged arteries leading to Kaye's
heart.
</P>
<P>
   Through that tube Chou shot an experimental fluid that
represents one of the most ambitious research efforts in
biotechnology: the attempt to grow new blood vessels in hearts too
weak to repair using traditional techniques like bypass surgery or
angioplasty.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists call the growth of new blood vessels angiogenesis,
and the search for drugs to stimulate this process has sparked a
race. Bay Area biotech giants Chiron and Genentech are among the
firms vying to discover ways to stimulate the heart; in essence, to
grow a bio-bypass around clogged arteries.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is a share of the multibillion-dollar market for
remedies to treat the 5 million Americans afflicted with angina _ a
condition in which a shortage of blood to the heart causes severe
chest pain.
</P>
<P>
   Angina patients like Kaye are the first possible beneficiaries
of angiogenesis. Today, when angina strikes, patients pop
nitroglycerin pills to relax their arteries, temporarily increasing
blood flow to the heart.
</P>
<P>
   Angiogenesis aims to provide permanent relief by growing new
canals to irrigate parched heart muscles. Kaye was the first
patient out of 300 who will take part in Chiron's Phase II clinical
trials during the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech has already completed Phase II human trials. Both
companies still face a third _ and more rigorous _ phase of human
trials before seeking Food and Drug Administration for their drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming nothing goes wrong, it could still be three to five
years before either company completes this process. But Chou is
guardedly optimistic these tests will one day lead to drugs to
safely repair the sickest hearts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a ray of hope,'' he said. ``But we really don't have
the final answer.''
</P>
<P>
   When Chou threaded the catheter into Kaye's heart last week,
neither doctor nor patient knew whether the tube dispensed Chiron's
drug or a placebo. The 67-year-old San Franciscan volunteered
knowing he might be a control subject, denied treatment so
scientists can later tell whether drug-treated hearts show better
blood flow than untreated ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through two bypasses and seven angioplasties, and I
still have angina,'' Kaye said. ``I'll take any chance I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the race to develop angiogenic drugs has been driven by
the growing numbers of patients like Kaye, who have been kept alive
by treatments like bypass surgery and angioplasty, but still have
clogged arteries and chest pains.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some extent we're the victims of our own success,'' said
Dr. Tim Henry, a cardiology professor at the University of
Minnesota. ``We've kept so many people alive who would have died of
heart attacks in the past, that we're growing patients who've
exhausted all the other options.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry, who has tested both the Genentech and Chiron drugs, said
at some point surgeons can no longer splice in another new artery
to bypass blockages to relieve heart pain. Clogged blood vessels
eventually become so weak their walls collapse, rendering
angioplasty useless as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angiogenesis is the next evolutionary step in heart
treatment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Henry will unveil the most comprehensive experimental
data so far gathered on angiogenic drugs in a presentation before
the American College of Cardiologists in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Henry's data will show whether Genentech's drug, vascular
endothelial growth factor, or VEGF, improved blood flow in a trial
involving 178 patients, some of whom got placebos.
</P>
<P>
   Though unable to divulge the results in advance, Henry explained
the similarities and differences between Genentech's VEGF test drug
and Chiron's candidate, fibroblast growth factor or FGF.
</P>
<P>
   Both test drugs are administered through a catheter threaded to
the heart. The drug (or placebo) is released inside the blocked
blood vessels and allowed to seep toward the areas where blood flow
is restricted.
</P>
<P>
   Henry said earlier research has shown that when the heart
becomes parched for lack of blood, the muscle tries to repair
itself through natural angiogenesis. The damaged heart tissues send
out signals, called receptors, that attract the VEGF and FGF that
our bodies normally produce.
</P>
<P>
   The hypothesis being tested in the current experiments is
simple: If doctors give the heart mega-doses of VEGF or FGF, will
the heart grow enough new blood vessels to irrigate the muscle and
relieve angina?
</P>
<P>
   Even if the tests show mega-dosing works in this way,
researchers will also have to prove _ to the FDA _ that it's safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern is that you're introducing compounds that might
cause unwanted vascularization (blood vessel growth) elsewhere in
the body,'' explained Chou at UCSF.
</P>
<P>
   The hypothetical danger is that these growth factors will escape
from the heart and find tiny tumors _ which need blood to expand _
and unwittingly fuel cancer growth.
</P>
<P>
   Chou said researchers will be alert for this and for hints that
these growth factors might grow unwanted blood vessels in the eye,
which could lead to blindness.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at Genentech and Chiron believe their drugs will
eventually prove safe and effective, but since they still have so
far to go in the FDA approval process, they can do little more than
keep their fingers crossed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, each company _ Genentech is based in South San
Francisco and Chiron in Emeryville _ subtly touts its supposed
advantages.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech clinical scientist Ted McCluskey cq &LR; noted that his
company's completed second stage VEGF trials put it perhaps a year
ahead of Chiron's FGF.
</P>
<P>
   McCluskey said Genentech is hopeful that the molecular structure
of VEGF will lessen any likelihood the compound will roam the body
causing mischief. He said VEGF seems to bind to a protein called
heparan, &LR;  cq  &LR; which is present around blood vessels. The hope is
that the most of the VEGF dripped into heart arteries will be
captured as it flows through, leaving little to circulate through
the body.
</P>
<P>
   Chiron clinical physician Bruce Scharschmidt cq  &LR; said his
researchers also hope to show that FGF has a molecular
``stickiness'' to heparan, binding most of the chemical to the
heart arteries where it is introduced.
</P>
<P>
   Scharschmidt said the body's own processes should protect it
against any FGF that does circulate through the system. Remember
that angiogenesis begins when blood-starved areas send out receptor
signals. In the absence of signals, researchers hope any escaped
FGF will be ignored by normal tissues that aren't blood starved.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chiron may lag in the race, Scharschmidt believes FGF
has certain advantages because it seems to grow arterial blood
vessels, which are larger in diameter than the thinner capillaries
stimulated by VEGF. This suggests FGF might prompt more blood flow,
thus greater relief, to the heart.
</P>
<P>
   With years of research ahead, such conjectures remain
unanswered. UCSF's Chou said experiments could ultimately show that
the heart needs both VEGF and FGF to promote angiogenesis, and that
patients might benefit from a cocktail of the two drugs. Or they
might not work at all.
</P>
<P>
   But for the millions of people like Kaye who live with angina,
the research _ indeed the race _ holds out the prospect that
science could one day provide a way to relieve the pounding chest
pain that can be precursors to heart failure or death.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, volunteering is a kind of payback for all they've done
to keep me going,'' he said. ``This may be a total waste of time
for me, but somebody will eventually benefit from the research.''

 CHRON - HEWLETT-PACKARD  
 HP's Heir Apparent Leads Internet Push  &HT;     By David Einstein 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Hewlett-Packard is good at a lot of things, but exploiting the
Internet has not been one of them. Now, however, the computer and
electronics giant is vowing to catch up quickly and become a force
in electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   A profitable Internet strategy could help reinvigorate HP, which
has suffered through more than two years of financial
disappointments. And it would make a hero of Ann Livermore, who is
spearheading the effort. In fact, industry observers say she could
end up running the Palo Alto company _ and become the most powerful
woman in technology.
</P>
<P>
   Livermore, a 17-year company veteran with heavy experience in
marketing, runs the Enterprise Computing Solutions Organization,
which was created in October to put HP's corporate hardware and
software under one roof. The group boasts 44,000 workers and
accounts for some $15 million in annual sales _ both nearly a third
of the company's totals.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge facing Livermore is to lift HP to the same level
in the minds of customers as IBM and Sun Microsystems, both of
which have done a much better job of positioning themselves as
Internet companies. IBM has grabbed the high ground with television
ads touting its expertise in e-business, while Sun's image has been
enhanced by the popularity of Java, the Internet programming
language it developed.
</P>
<P>
   HP, meanwhile, has been flailing about, trying to craft a
cohesive Internet strategy that integrates its online business and
security products.
</P>
<P>
   The problem can't be blamed on HP's technology and products,
which are lauded for their quality and reliability. Instead, the
company has been badly out-marketed by its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in our DNA to build great products, but there are other
areas such as customer relations in which we could be doing a
better job,'' said Duane Zitzner, the general manager of HP's
personal computer and workstation business.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the technology,'' analyst Daniel Kunstler of J.P.
Morgan agreed. ``They just haven't been able to pull it into the
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Livermore means to change all that. Last Thursday, she told an
analysts conference in New York that HP will unveil, in the next
three months, Internet software that will let a broad range of
computers and other electronic devices communicate with each other
online.
</P>
<P>
   HP hopes the software, along with alliances it also plans to
announce, will lead to a new kind of Internet portal offering
comprehensive services in areas such as banking and travel. Such a
service, for example, could notify a car rental company or hotel
when an expected customer's plane is late, said Nick Earle, vice
president of marketing for Livermore's organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``HP will provide software technology to build the services, and
over and above that, we'll offer to manage them,'' Earle.
</P>
<P>
   Livermore's appointment effectively elevated her to the No.2
position at HP behind Lew Platt, the avuncular and media-shy chief
executive who has done little to sharpen the company's focus since
taking command in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Platt's inability to articulate a vision for HP _ especially its
plan for the Internet _ is cited as one of the company's most
glaring weaknesses. The omission has allowed its rivals to take the
high ground in the fight for the fast-growing e-commerce market.
</P>
<P>
   During Platt's tenure, HP has gone from a company hitting on all
cylinders to one that's been stalling at every street light. In
1995, earnings rose at an annual clip of 51 percent and revenues
grew by 26 percent. Last year, profits fell by 6 percent to $2.9
billion and revenue increased by just 10 percent to 47.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   HP's stock, once one of the steadiest performers in the
technology sector, sat out the great tech rally of 1998, rising in
value just 10 percent for the year. It has been rising lately,
however, largely on anticipation of the new Internet strategy. It
closed up $1.19 at $76.44 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In Platt's defense, HP may be one of the most difficult
companies in the world to run. It boasts five semiautonomous groups
that turn out a wide range of products from handheld calculators to
enterprise servers, as well as printers, scanners, test equipment
for chipmakers, and medical equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that mix competitive price pressures coming from all
directions as well as economic turmoil in Asia, and you have the
recipe for a financial malaise, not to mention a king-size headache
for the person at the top.
</P>
<P>
   Given all the bad news, it's only logical that the media have
been hunting around for a possible successor to Platt, who in three
years will reach HP's retirement age of 60. One candidate seemed to
be Rick Belluzzo, who ran HP's computer organization, but he left
about a year ago to take the top position at Silicon Graphics.
Since then, there has been no heir apparent until Livermore jumped
onto the stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every company should have two or three people it's grooming as
possible successors,'' she said, adding, ``I'd have to say I'm in
that camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Livermore, 40, is a Stanford MBA with a reputation as a
hard-nosed but likeable manager. And compared to the bland Platt,
she's positively charismatic. Just the kind of person HP needs to
compete for headlines with people like Lou Gerstner of IBM or Sun's
Scott McNealy.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street's initial reaction to Livermore has been positive.
Several analysts have upgraded HP's stock, confident that she will
be able to jump start the company with her Internet initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Milunovich, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, expects HP to
create an Internet division aimed at bringing together what until
now has been a fragmented effort. ``Creating a unified Enterprise
Computer Systems Organization under Ann Livermore was a prelude to
a cohesive Internet push,'' he wrote in a recent report.
</P>
<P>
   ``HP admits it missed the first wave of Internet computing but
believes the second (e-commerce) wave will be even bigger.'' he
wrote. ``HP may very well have all the pieces to become a leader.
In our view, the company's challenge will be packaging and
promoting its capabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   While insisting that HP already has a solid Internet presence _
she noted that the company's OpenView software manages 70 percent
of all Internet servers _ Livermore acknowledged, ``We haven't been
too visible about it.''
</P>
<P>
   To correct that situation, she has elevated marketing to a top
priority in the person of Earle, who has become her right-hand man.
That's unusual for HP, which traditionally has pitched individual
products far more than corporate strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Livermore believes that an active campaign to improve the
company's image with customers also will serve to motivate HP
workers, whose morale has dropped during the financial downturn.
Last year, the company tightened up on travel and other expenses,
cut top executives' salaries and closed all its offices for a week
in December, giving workers an unpaid vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A key benefit of our getting out there and showing the flag is
that it will help inspire 44,000 people,'' said Livermore. ``We
think it will create a rolling thunder inside the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, but it's unclear whether she will succeed in bringing the
rest of HP onboard. For one thing, the flat management structure _
six organization leaders reporting directly to Platt _ could make
for a struggle over succession.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, at least one HP group, the $8 billion Measurement
Organization, which makes devices for testing everything from phone
equipment to semiconductors, has been having real problems due
mostly to the Asian economic crisis and a downturn in the
semiconductor sector last year. In the fourth quarter, sales from
test and measurement equipment dropped 19 percent compared with the
year before.
</P>
<P>
   Edward (Ned) Barnholt, who sits atop the Measurement
Organization, said the Asian situation appears to have stabilized.
``We're seeing a modest increase in business there,'' he said,
adding, ``I wouldn't call it robust, but it's encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnholt declined to comment on reports that HP, believing
measurement no longer dovetails with its main computing business,
might decide to spin off the Measurement Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Critics argue that the decentralized nature of HP, which worked
to its advantage when it was smaller, is a liability for a firm
with revenues of nearly $50 billion that is trying to come up with
companywide strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Phil Rueppel of BT Alex. Brown said he thinks that given
HP's decentralized structure, as well as its historically cautious
attitude about change, ``The company may not be as adaptive and
flexible as it should be to deal with the new business
opportunities of e-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, HP officials disagree, saying decentralization
actually makes the company more nimble. ``The value of the
decentralized culture at HP is the biggest strength we have,'' said
Antonio Perez, who runs the company's ink-jet-printer business.
``It will allow us to adapt a lot better than other companies to
changes in the industry's ecosystem.''

PLANNED SAFETY TREATY ON GENETICALLY ALTERED GOODS IS CRITICIZED
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Delegates from about 170 nations are meeting this week to
complete an international biotechnology safety treaty that the
United States government and many American companies fear could
greatly restrict exports of food and other products made using
genetic engineering.
</P>
<P>
   The Biosafety Protocol, which is being negotiated in Cartagena,
Colombia, would require that exports of genetically modified
organisms be approved in advance by the importing country.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations are an outgrowth of the Convention on
Biological Diversity drawn up at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro
in 1992. They are scheduled because of concern that the release of
genetically modified plants and animals into the environment.
</P>
<P>
   In genetically altering an organism, genes from one species may
be spliced into another to confer certain desirable traits, like
resistance to blights or pests. One concern is that these enhanced
organisms could overtake and displace native species, reducing the
variety of the gene pool.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington and many American companies say such new rules
could impede tens of billions of dollars of annual exports of
seeds, grains and perhaps even products like breakfast cereal made
from genetically modified corn, or blue jeans made using
genetically modified cotton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could create enormous disruption to existing patterns of
international trade with no benefits to the environment or human
health,'' said Val Giddings, vice president for food and
agriculture at the Biotechnology Industry Organization, a trade
group. ``Some of the proposals would put in place a draconian
regime that we have never seen before except for highly toxic and
hazardous substances.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington thinks it is appropriate to have a treaty covering
genetically modified seeds, said Rafe Pomerance, deputy assistant
secretary of state for environment and development and head of the
American delegation in Cartagena.
</P>
<P>
   What worries the government and American companies is that some
nations are proposing that the new rules cover not only seeds,
plants and animals but also genetically altered corn, soy beans and
other agricultural commodities. Some proposals would go even
further and apply the treaty to products made using genetic
engineering, like pharmaceuticals, cookies made from genetically
altered grain, or even paper containing corn starch made from
genetically altered corn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The protocol is being written to cover living modified
organisms which have the potential to threaten the environment,''
said Steven Daugherty, director of government and industry
relations at Pioneer Hi-Bred International, the world's largest
seed company. ``It's hard to see how corn starch fits that.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States exports more than $50 billion of agricultural
products each year. And an increasing share of the major crops are
genetically engineered. Genetically engineered crops accounted for
25 percent of the corn acreage planted in the United States last
year, 38 percent of the soy bean acreage and 45 percent of the
cotton acreage, according to the Biotechnology Industry
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   But many other nations, including those in Europe, have resisted
genetically engineered seeds and foods, worried that not enough is
known about the possible effects on human health and the
environment. Indeed, one argument American industry makes against
the Biosafety Protocol is that it is not needed because countries
already can and do restrict agricultural imports.
</P>
<P>
   Kristin Dawkins, a director at the Institute for Agriculture and
Trade Policy, a nonprofit organization based in Minneapolis that
deals with farming policy, said it is legitimate for the treaty to
apply to food because there could be risks to animals and humans
from the ingestion of genetically modified food. Possible dangers
could include the spread of toxins, allergies or resistance to
antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent to Vice President Al Gore last week, her group
and other farm, environmental and consumer groups from around the
world urged the United States to ``demonstrate flexibility'' in the
negotiations and not act like ``a brutish lobbyist for corporate
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   It is still not clear how the treaty will turn out, or even if
an agreement will be reached. There are deep disagreements not only
about which products will be covered but also on fundamental
questions like whether products made with genetic engineering
should be labeled as such, whether creators of such products should
be liable for damages, and how any conflict between the protocol
and the rules of the World Trade Organization would be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The United States will take part in the negotiations but will
not be able to vote because it never ratified the 1992 biological
diversity treaty, which was opposed by many Senate Republicans.
``This has constrained our ability to work in these negotiations,''
said Pomerance of the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's position in the negotiations is generally supported
by other big agricultural exporters like Canada, Australia and
Argentina, according to industry and environmental group officials
who have been following the talks, which began a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia leads a group of African nations, many of them in the
tropics with abundant biodiversity, which are pushing for the
widest scope and most stringent rules. The European Union is
somewhere in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   The nations that signed the 1992 biological diversity treaty are
scheduled to meet next Monday and Tuesday in Cartagena to formally
approve the language of the new treaty that will be drawn up by a
working group this week. The treaty would take effect after a
certain, as yet undetermined, number of nations ratify it.

UCLA DOWN, BUT DAVIS IS UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As his team struggles, Baron Davis flourishes.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, UCLA's sophomore guard, is playing the best basketball of
his career and has emerged as one of the top point guards in the
country _ on equal footing with Arizona's Jason Terry and Utah's
Andre Miller.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bruins' two Bay Area defeats, Davis made 18 of 30 field
goals, 7 of 11 3-point shots and scored 50 points. He was the only
reason UCLA avoided humiliation in an otherwise lethargic
performance at Cal.
</P>
<P>
   Step back three weeks and Davis' numbers are equally impressive:
In his last seven games, Davis is shooting 56.6 percent from the
field, 52.1 percent from 3-point range and averaging 19.7 points,
with 41 assists and 19 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best he's played by a long shot, and it's not even
close in terms of the complete game,'' UCLA coach Steve Lavin said.
``In some ways, he's slowed his game down. In trying to do less,
what he's eliminated is the unnecessary forced shots. He's showing
patience, judgment and discretion.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis has not fully recovered from April surgery to repair a
torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee. Although he has
regained conditioning and can play 35 minutes without trouble, he
doesn't have the pre-injury bounce in his leg that produced his
spectacular play.
</P>
<P>
   But he has become a more cerebral player, thinking his way
through games, compensating for his knee, picking his spots to
shoot and score.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I can get my shot off at any point, but as a point
guard I've learned to keep everybody in the game,'' he said. ``I
just go with the flow, and I get easier looks at the basket.''
</P>
<P>
   Second time's not a charm: It appears opponents have adjusted to
the Bruins' aggressive defense in the second half of league play.
</P>
<P>
   The teams UCLA has faced twice _ Oregon, Oregon State, Stanford
and Cal _ shot a combined 40.4 percent against the Bruins in the
first half of Pac-10 play, 46.4 percent the second time around.
</P>
<P>
   Moiso update: Freshman forward Jerome Moiso said it was his
decision to sit out Saturday's game because of tendinitis in his
right foot. Moiso hopes to return this week, but Lavin wasn't sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so tender, he has a hard time walking,'' Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: In two games in the Bay Area, guard Earl Watson
made 5 of 15 shots and committed seven turnovers, and center Dan
Gadzuric made 6 of 15 shots and committed eight turnovers. . . .
Lavin plans to start Brandon Loyd and Sean Farnham against USC on
Wednesday and use Todd Ramasar as his sixth man. Combined, they
have scored 23 points in conference play. . . . Lavin sent his
apology letter not only to Washington but to all the coaches and
athletic directors in the Pac-10. Although he felt protesting
referee Terry Christman's sensitive whistle was necessary, a source
said, Lavin later saw replays of his Jan. 31 outburst and realized
he went over the line. . . . UCLA has not lost three consecutive
games since February 1992, when the Don MacLean-Tracy Murray team
lost to Notre Dame, USC and Duke.

ANALYST WHO PROMOTED INTEL TO JOIN TIGER HEDGE FUND 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH KAHN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Thomas Kurlak, a Merrill Lynch analyst whose bullish
forecasts helped promote the Intel Corp.'s stock price into the
stratosphere but who changed his mind too soon, has resigned to
join a leading hedge fund.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Management LLC said Kurlak would manage the giant fund's
portfolio of technology stocks beginning later this month. Merrill
did not announce a replacement for Kurlak, who worked at the
brokerage firm for 20 years and became one of Wall Street's most
respected technology experts.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Kurlak made unerringly accurate calls on Intel stock,
promoting it to Merrill's large base of retail and institutional
clients as it grew from a little-known chip maker into one of
America's most profitable companies. He also foresaw the glut of
world chip-making capacity that sapped profits in the semiconductor
industry in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But Kurlak's increasingly cautious predictions about Intel last
year proved overly bearish, hurting his reputation, fund managers
said. Though his downgrading of Intel stock last spring initially
proved prescient when the stock price slumped, a further downgrade
in August _ Kurlak's reduced Merrill's rating from ``accumulate''
to ``neutral'' - backfired. Intel's stock shot up by nearly half
soon after he made that call and its earnings proved more resilient
than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger, the hedge fund run by Julian Robertson, has recently
lured several well-known analysts from investment banks to bolster
its fund management.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A few days after Auburn surprisingly canceled its
football game at Florida State, Brian Swanson picked up the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Swanson, Cal State Northridge's assistant athletic director for
external affairs, wanted to see if the Matadors could fill the hole
in the Tigers' schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Swanson was beaten to the punch. Appalachian State had already
filled the slot with Auburn. And CSUN is still looking for an
alternative to Southern Utah, the scheduled opponent in its Sept. 4
opener.
</P>
<P>
   The CSUN coaches do not want to play the Thunderbirds. They were
incensed when three starters went down with injuries, from what
they considered chop-blocks, which are illegal, when the teams
played last season.
</P>
<P>
   As of right now, however, head coach Ron Ponciano said there is
a ``90 percent'' possibility the Matadors will play at Southern
Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has any openings in that window that we would have an
opening,'' Ponciano said. ``We've done everything to get a game.
People are starting to flinch a little bit now. People aren't as
eager to play Cal State Northridge as they used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Swanson, who has been working the phones along with Ponciano and
interim athletic director Sam Jankovich, hasn't given up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two or three schools start dropping games and people start
falling all over themselves,'' Swanson said. ``There's so many
different scenarios out there.''
</P>
<P>
   One scenario has CSUN ``buying out'' Southern Utah _ probably
for $10,000 _ and hosting a game on Sept. 4. The travel costs to
Utah probably would run more than the buyout anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Swanson said he hopes to have the schedule, with or without
Southern Utah, finalized by the first week of March.
</P>
<P>
   Attacking the job: When Allison Lee was a soccer player at Cal
Poly Pomona, she looked for every opening in the defense, attacking
relentlessly.
</P>
<P>
   She became the school's all-time leading scorer. Now she's
making points in her bid to become CSUN's head women's soccer
coach.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 26, has held the interim head coach title since Jan. 1,
replacing Brian Wiesner, who resigned after four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN is conducting a national search for a full-time
replacement, but it may not have to look far after the way Lee has
conducted herself in the last 1{ months.
</P>
<P>
   She has been a constant presence at high school games, and the
Matadors have already gotten commitments from two local standouts.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN has been criticized in the past for not recruiting local
talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I care a lot about this program,'' said Lee, who was Wiesner's
top assistant. ``There's no reason why the talented players in this
valley should be leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is the possibility Lee is assembling a talented
team for another coach. She doesn't mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've grown very attached to the team,'' she said. ``I want the
program to do well. I want (the team) to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN also is in the process of hiring a men's head coach. Both
openings should be filled by the end of next month.
</P>
<P>
   Magic number: The standard has been set in college basketball:
20 victories.
</P>
<P>
   To get that many in a season gives most college basketball teams
cause for celebration. The CSUN men have an outside shot at 20
wins, but the Matadors already accomplished one goal Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN earned its 15th win Saturday night, 83-62 over Montana
State, the highest win total in a season since the program went to
Division I in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this 15th win means a lot to us,'' CSUN head coach
Bobby Braswell said. ``We're heading in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking them home: Braswell shared this story Saturday night,
after senior guard Derrick Higgins played his last home game:
</P>
<P>
   ``The very first time I met Derrick Higgins, I was on my
interview here,'' Braswell said. ``I was meeting with the team and
he walked in with a towel on his head and he was holding a big,
long stick. He was calling himself Moses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought about that tonight in chapel. Moses led his
people to the promised land. Derrick has been a leader for us. He's
been just a great kid.''

SENATORS SHIFTING TO ISSUES AND THE 2000 CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This article is part of TIMES EXPRESS. It is a condensed
version of a story that will appear in tomorrow's New York Times.) 
(ms) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With President Clinton's acquittal behind them,
senators of both parties Sunday turned to issues like Social
Security, taxes and foreign policy, while another Republican
announced he was taking steps to seek his party's presidential
nomination next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Sunday morning talk shows were notable for showcasing how
eager the nation's political leaders are to move beyond the
impeachment struggle that consumed Congress for five months.
Senators quickly shifted to the legislative arena and sounded the
opening notes of the policy battles that are likely to shape the
presidential and congressional races in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in particular, who have seen their approval ratings
sink across the past months, worked to show that their party stands
for more than investigating Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A critical question in the wake of the impeachment struggle is
whether Clinton and Congress can overcome the anger and partisan
bitterness and work together.
</P>
<P>
   John Podesta, the White House chief of staff, said on ABC's
``This Week'' that for the second consecutive day the president
spoke with the congressional leadership about the possible troop
deployment in Kosovo and domestic issues.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, a Democrat who has
often been at odds with Clinton, and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
both warned that Clinton would make a mistake if he mounted an
all-out political campaign against those, such as the House
managers, who had worked hardest to remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has opportunities, but he will squander them if there's any
note of vengeance,'' Moynihan said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, the House Budget Committee chairman,
announced on ``Meet the Press'' that he would file papers Monday
with the Federal Election Commission to set up a presidential
exploratory committee, joining a crowded field of Republican
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, another of the Republican presidential contenders,
reluctantly supported Clinton's decision to send troops to Kosovo.
But he criticized Clinton for failing to prepare the American
people for the deployment.

THE SMILING TIM WELSH  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JUDY BATTISTA    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tim Welsh was just a few minutes removed from his Providence
College team's 84-57 blowout loss to St. John's last month when a
wistful smile crossed his face. He spoke of wiping the game off the
board by the next day's practice, so the negative feelings would
not linger.
</P>
<P>
   It was the sort of feel-good reaction the Providence players
have come to expect from their first-year coach, who nearly turned
down the job last spring because he dreaded saying goodbye to his
players at Iona so much that he canceled six meetings to announce
his resignation. Welsh, whose team faces St. John's again Monday
night at Alumni Hall, has resisted the tough love and histrionics
many coaches have adopted, weaving instead a personality that
combines the demanding work he learned from several coaches,
including his father, and the indulgence of his mother. While
others lead like Marines, Welsh sometimes sounds more like Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that scares me is we'll go into halftime down 6,''
said Providence's star forward, Jamel Thomas of Brooklyn, ``and
he'll be smiling. And I'm thinking, what's wrong with this guy? He
makes us feel good about our mistakes. He doesn't yell. His
assistants yell. When his assistants are yelling, he's smiling. I'm
telling you, this guy is crazy. Crazy in a good way.''
</P>
<P>
   Just one year after taking the eventual national champion,
Arizona, to overtime before falling in the final eight of the
National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament, the Friars
went 13-16 last season, a disappointment at a place that has
employed, among others, Rick Pitino. When Pete Gillen left to take
the head job at Virginia, Welsh became the Friars' fourth coach in
10 years, and they were picked by his Big East brethren to finish
near the bottom of the league.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Welsh, 38, using his brotherly demeanor _ after an
early-season loss, he insisted to his disbelieving team that it was
improving _ an up-tempo offense and pressure defense he learned
largely from Pitino, has turned Providence in the other direction.
Despite losing five of its past seven games _ three by lopsided
margins _ the Friars are 14-10 over all and 7-7 in the Big East.
</P>
<P>
   They have beaten North Carolina State, Purdue and, on the road,
Syracuse, a team coached by Welsh's mentor, Jim Boeheim, whose
frequently dour demeanor clearly did not rub off on Welsh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have my father's work ethic but a lot of my mother's
personality,'' Welsh said. ``I'm more relaxed. I can certainly lose
it, but only at points where it makes sense. Some kids need to be
yelled at more than others. Others need hugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players take on the personality of their coach. If I'm roiling
on the inside, they'll see through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Before this season, when Welsh looked at tapes of last season's
games, he did not think that Providence's circumstances were as
dire as his Big East colleagues did. But he also admitted that he
did not know how the team would respond to him after the departure
of the popular Gillen.
</P>
<P>
   Welsh's first lessons in relating to players were from his
father, Jerry, who won a Division III national championship and was
second three times in a 23-year career at Potsdam State. He
followed his father to practices, games and recruiting trips
beginning at the age of 3. Jerry Welsh has a picture of Tim, then a
fourth grader, at a coaching clinic in Saratoga Springs. Tim is in
a coat and tie, standing next to John Wooden.
</P>
<P>
   But Welsh also saw the strain the all-consuming coach's life
causes his family. After playing for his father at Potsdam State,
he became a salesman of air cargo space.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hours my father put in _ I wasn't sure if I wanted to
commit my whole life to what he did,'' Welsh said. ``I saw the ups
and downs, and the downs were really down. You saw the family pain.
It's a tough time, with a lot of traveling. It's not normal.''
</P>
<P>
   But he soon missed the rhythms of the season and, after
inquiring at many New York-area programs, became a volunteer
assistant to Pat Kennedy at Iona in 1985. Welsh made sales calls in
the morning and was at practices in the afternoon. He used vacation
time to go on road trips. His doubts erased, he followed Kennedy to
Florida State in 1986 and joined Boeheim's Syracuse staff in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Iona's athletic director, Rick Petriccione, who had been on
Kennedy's staff at Iona and Florida State with Welsh, wanted to
hire Jerry Welsh as Iona's coach in 1991, with Tim coming as the
assistant and heir apparent. Jerry Welsh was willing to make the
move for the sake of his son. Tim wasn't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him no once,'' Tim Welsh said. ``I went back and felt
bad _ as a son _ and then I told him yes. You only have one father,
and you have a chance to be with him every day. This is the
twilight of his career and would you ever have a chance again to go
to the tournament with your father?''
</P>
<P>
   Iona went 30-26 in the Welshes' first two seasons, but had just
17 victories total in the next two seasons. Ten games before the
end of that fourth season together, Jerry Welsh was forced to
retire suddenly when doctors found a heart defect. Tim became the
head coach, finished 4-6 and then began a three-year run that
earned him a 70-22 record, two awards as Metro Atlantic Athletic
Conference coach of the year and a trip to the 1998 NCAA
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   When Welsh got to Providence, Thomas said, he told the players
that, because he was single and had no children, he would devote
all his time to them. Thomas was devastated when Gillen left and
thought briefly about quitting. Now, he said, ``I love Coach
Gillen, but I love Coach Welsh, too, even though I haven't known
him for a year.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Welsh's smile rarely has cause to dim. Karim Shabazz, a
7-foot-2-inch transfer from Florida State, who also had been
coveted by St. John's, is in the fold, and Providence has surpassed
nearly all expectations and will very likely end up in the National
Invitation Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas and his teammate Corey Wright were talking one day,
wondering why their new coach was always laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask the players, `Why do you play the game?' '' Welsh said.
``It's not a job. A lot of coaches make it a grind. Not on purpose,
but because they feel the pressure. I do not want to make this a
grind.''

7 YEARS AFTER BEING PARALYZED, UTLEY TO TAKE HIS FIRST PUBLIC
STEPS
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By KEN GURNICK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. _ The letter to the football player, scribbled
in crayon, carried a message that sent a chill down the damaged
spine of Mike Utley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish,'' wrote the young fan, ``I could switch my legs for
yours, so you could play one more game.''
</P>
<P>
   Utley's response was humble. ``You read that,'' he said, ``and
what else is there? You better find a way to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   And so he has.
</P>
<P>
   More than seven years ago Utley, instantly paralyzed when he
fell on his head during a game, flashed a thumbs-up sign to his
horrified Detroit Lions teammates while being wheeled off the
Silverdome playing field, a painfully poignant image of the
unspoken dangers in sports.
</P>
<P>
   In a Phoenix hotel on Monday, Utley plans to rise from his
wheelchair and take his first public steps since he broke his neck.
There will be no hidden wires, no David Copperfield magic, no faith
healing. Just the payoff from painstaking and intense
rehabilitation. It will be an opportunity to publicize the Mike
Utley Foundation's pursuit of a cure for spinal cord injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Utley, a famous football victim along with players like Dennis
Byrd, Darryl Stingley and Marc Buoniconti, tries to use his fame to
promote a greater good.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my chance to tell people that life is not over after
an injury like this,'' said Utley, 33, who took his first steps
since the injury in a gym last December. ``This is a chance to tell
people that anything is possible if you have the desire to make it
happen. Push the envelope.''
</P>
<P>
   Utley pushes. Though he is medically defined as a quadriplegic,
he has extensive use of his arms. He drives cars and boats. He
scuba-dives and rides Sea-Doo personal watercraft. He snow-skied
until he separated a shoulder. He kayaks. He even, believe it or
not, sky-dives.
</P>
<P>
   None of this comes easily when your body is broken. In fact, his
problems only grew bigger after he landed on his head while
pass-blocking against the Los Angeles Rams on Nov. 17, 1991. Since
then, he has broken his nose, his foot and a toe. His body
struggles with functions most people take for granted, among them
the ability to perspire. Losing that ability makes regulating body
temperature tricky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I've had my share of adversity,'' he said. ``But that
won't stop me.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he is not bitter and never has been. He still hears from
former teammates and club executives, and misses the game
desperately. Shortly after the injury, he said something good would
come from it. What could that possibly be?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm alive,'' he said. ``I am alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Utley was a fun-loving, motorcycle-riding, hair-bleached free
spirit before the injury, and his the soul attitude remains the
same. Saturday, on a gorgeous February day in the desert, he
enjoyed a barbecue with friends and staff members from the
foundation as they prepared for the Monday news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Then, flanked by his friends Rob Fredrickson and Bill Lewis,
both football players, and wearing special shoes and leg braces, he
will stand and take baby steps and hope the television cameras beam
that image into the minds of potential donors to the foundation, as
well as the homes of the estimated 200,000 victims of spinal cord
injuries in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Not that every one of them can expect recovery similar to
Utley's. He has said that, in a strange way, he was lucky when he
fractured his sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae. In medical
terms, his injury was ``incomplete,'' meaning he was able to regain
limited feeling beyond the point of injury.
</P>
<P>
   And through wise financial planning and what he called generous
support by the National Football League _ ``They really took care
of me,'' he said _ Utley could afford top medical care: years of
rehabilitation at the Craig Hospital in Denver, three months each
year of biofeedback therapy at the University of Miami School of
Medicine, and now daily work with a chiropractor, a physical
therapist and a personal trainer at Gold's Gym in Wenatchee, Wash.,
where he lives for part of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Barth Green, chairman of neurosurgery at the University of
Miami School of Medicine and president of the Miami Project to Cure
Paralysis, said of Utley: ``He's not one who sits around waiting
for something good to happen. He's extremely committed to his
wellness and his rehabilitation. Even with that, it doesn't mean
someone will improve neurologically. In only a few percent of cases
is there such a spectacular recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Green, who was involved in the physical rehabilitations of
the football player Marc Buoniconti, who broke his neck while
making a tackle in a college game in 1985, and the singer Gloria
Estefan, whose back was severely injured in a bus accident in 1990:
``I don't know many people who are willing to spend six hours a day
for many years in rehab. I don't know for sure how much that
influenced his recovery, but I suspect a lot of people have the
same degree of injury and have done nothing to test or enhance
their recovery and haven't had the same results. He's gone to the
other extreme and not relied on a future breakthrough. He's gone a
million miles.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair McHaney, Utley's trainer, said that rehabilitation
normally focuses on strengthening muscles that are still
functioning. The unorthodox exercise regimen Utley began a year ago
focuses on muscles in the legs and buttocks in which there was no
function. Slowly, Utley showed progress. He stood in November and
took his first steps in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took about nine steps and everybody in the gym, their jaws
just dropped,'' McHaney said by telephone from Wenatchee. ``It was
pretty emotional. The place got real quiet. Mike said it was
amazing. It was pretty intimidating just seeing him tower over me
at 6 feet 6. To me, he had always been 4 feet 2 in the chair.''
</P>
<P>
   McHaney introduced Utley to Dani Andersen, a paramedic, at the
gym. Utley pestered her until she accepted a date riding Sea-Doos.
They have been together for a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike is so much fun to be with,'' she said. ``As much as he
does for himself, he'll do anything in the world for you.''
</P>
<P>
   When he is not working on rehabilitating his body, Utley works
on motivating others. The former starting right guard who opened
holes for Barry Sanders tries to open doors for victims of
spinal-cord injuries who feel shut out from life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to hospitals and talk to kids and teen-agers and moms and
dads,'' he said. ``I tell them the injury can't change you unless
you allow it to.''
</P>
<P>
   He won't allow it. He is building a house in Scottsdale so he
can be more involved with the foundation, which awards grants for
research, rehabilitation and educational programs. It was founded
by his former agent, Bruce Allen, now with the Raiders? and is
funded in large part by money generated from an NFL Properties
license to market ``Thumbs-Up'' merchandise. This past season, the
foundation received $80,000 from the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   His 6-foot-6-inch body, down to 240 pounds from his playing
weight of 315, is packed into a wheelchair, but not confined by it.
There's an envelope out there, and he's going to push it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to find a cure, that's what the foundation is
about,'' he said. ``I want to be fixed. I want to be normal. I want
to get married and have kids. I've got things to do to get to where
I want to be. They had to carry me off that Silverdome field. One
day, I want to walk off it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football is still driving me. Football got me into this
wheelchair and it's going to get me out.'' &QL;

   The first First Couple play a starring role beginning Tuesday at
the National Portrait Gallery in Washington where 25 depictions of
George and Martha Washington go on display through Aug. 8.
Commemorating the 200th anniversary of George's death, ``George and
Martha Washington: Portraits From the Presidential Years'' includes
the efforts by little-known and established artists, like Gilbert
Stuart, Charles Willson Peale, Rembrandt Peale and John Trumbull.

   An airplane factory begins operation Tuesday at the Tate Gallery
in London. But it's not as if the home of the National Collections
of British and Modern Art had decided to abandon art for commerce.
The manufacturing complex in the Tate's Duveen Galleries is an
installation, ``When Robots Rule: The One-Minute Airplane
Factory.'' Created specifically for the galleries by the American
artist Chris Burden, this 20-foot-long robotic assembly line
transforms tissue paper, balsa wood and plastic into rubber-band
powered model airplanes in a sequence that ends with each plane
ascending some 60 feet and landing on the gallery floor. The planes
are sold for about $8 each. Having illuminated the principles of
mass production, the factory will close on June 6, after making
some 86,000 aircraft. Information: 011-44-171-887-8727.

   ``Sesame Street'' is 30 years old, and in conjunction with that

end a nationwide tour Tuesday in New York, its final stop. Among
the artists represented in ``Art From the Fuzzy and Famous,''
through March 11 at the Museum of Television and Radio, are Tony
Bennett, Barbara Bush, Kevin Kline, Rosie O'Donnell, Itzhak Perlman
and Julia Roberts. Information: (212) 621-6600.

   Kevin Spacey was named best actor when the Society of London
Theater handed out the Laurence Olivier Awards. Spacey was honored
for his performance in ``The Iceman Cometh.'' Eileen Atkins was
named best actress for ``The Unexpected Man.'' A revival of
``Oklahoma!'' was cited as outstanding musical. Its choreographer,
Susan Stroman, and its set designer, Anthony Ward, were also
honored, as was Shuler Hensley, for best supporting performance in
a musical. Nicole Kidman and Iain Glen of ``The Blue Room,'' now on
Broadway, were overlooked for acting honors, but its lighting
designer, Hugh Vanstone, won an Olivier.

   A day after a federal judge cited their union for contempt and
threatened to fine it $10 million, pilots at American Airlines
began returning to work in large numbers Sunday, easing the
disruption that has inconvenienced hundreds of thousands of
travelers over the last eight days.
</P>
<P>
   American said Sunday that it expected to cancel 260 to 270 of
its 2,250 daily flights Monday, the fewest since last Monday, and
hoped to be flying its full schedule by Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be almost there tomorrow (Tuesday),'' Chris Chiames,
an American spokesman, said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But the company must still settle the dispute with the pilots
over its acquisition of Reno Air, a small airline in the West. The
two sides are expected to meet Monday, their first negotiations
since Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   About 900 of American's 9,200 pilots were listed as sick Sunday,
down from a peak of 2,400 on Friday but still above the normal
level of 400. As a result, American, the country's second-largest
airline, said it was forced to cancel 552 flights, far below the
peak of 1,170 it canceled on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At airports in Miami, New York and Dallas, there were fewer
angry passengers and shorter lines at the ticket counters of both
American and other airlines, some of which were deluged by American
ticket holders during the sickout.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Sumpter, a hospital administrator in Phoenix, had been
trying to get home for two days without success because her
connecting flight through Dallas was canceled repeatedly. But
Sunday, after American advised her to come to La Guardia Airport,
she got the good news that her flight was finally going.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an 8-year-old at home,'' she said, ``so I want to get
back to him.''
</P>
<P>
   At Miami International Airport, American handed out free roses
to passengers while two of its baggage handlers entertained
passengers by singing gospel music, Motown and Frank Sinatra
ballads. ``This has alleviated the stress,'' said Earl Brinkley,
who was playing compact disks to provide the musical background
while his colleague, Larry Branchetti, sang.
</P>
<P>
   Watching were Ernie and Sue Weishaupt, who were waiting for an
evening flight to St. Lucia to begin their honeymoon. When their
original flight from Orlando was canceled, they drove to Tampa. But
the flight there ended up not flying as well, costing them a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't reschedule your honeymoon,'' Ms. Weishaupt said.
``Now on the flight to St. Lucia, they gave us separate seats. Can
you imagine? It hasn't been a good experience.'' Weishaupt said he
was just hoping that the evening flight was for real.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots began returning to work after Judge Joe Kendall of
the federal District Court in Dallas cited the union for contempt
on Saturday and ordered it to set aside $10 million for damages. He
also fined Richard T. LaVoy, the union's president, $10,000 and
Brian Mayhew, its vice president, $5,000. A hearing is scheduled
for Wednesday for the judge to determine how much the union will
pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The union is responsible for the damages these passengers have
suffered,'' he wrote in his sharply worded ruling, referring to the
hundreds of thousands of inconvenienced travelers. ``It is also
clear that the union leadership could care less about these
people,'' he added.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   American said in court that the sickout had cost it $40 million.
Wall Street analysts have estimated that the company will suffer
much higher losses by the time the disruption ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The damage to the company has been extensive,'' Donald J.
Carty, the chairman and chief executive of the AMR Corporation,
American's parent, said in a message to employees on Saturday.
``Not just in terms of money, but most importantly in terms of good
will with our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Kendall had ruled on Wednesday that the sickout was
illegal and ordered the pilots to return to work, but American
complained that the union leadership had not complied with the
order.
</P>
<P>
   But after the contempt citation, LaVoy made a personal plea on
the union's hot line on Saturday night. ``We need to get this
airline back up and running at full capacity, and we need to do so
quickly,'' he said. ``Please clear the sick list immediately and
resume your normal schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Though many pilots may have removed themselves from the list,
American's troubles may not be over. Some pilots have said that
they plan to adhere strictly to work rules and many may decline to
fly voluntary overtime, which American depends on to maintain its
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Chiames said that many pilots liked to do extra flying because
it allowed them to earn more money. ``If it is true that they are
not going to do it, then we will have to schedule around that,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In a small way, Paul Tidwell is closing the circle for more than
100 Japanese families torn by war.
</P>
<P>
   A half century ago, their loved ones disappeared at sea aboard
the I-52, a Japanese submarine. The craft was carrying two tons of
gold and other material to Hitler when American forces torpedoed
her in the Atlantic, sending the warship to a grave more than three
miles down.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Tidwell is flying to Japan to give the families three
shoes he found near the sunken warship. The families, all members
of a group formed to honor the I-52 dead, have planned memorial
services across the country this week.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the I-52 was presumed lost forever, her 109 men
gone, little more than memories.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1995, Tidwell, a maritime researcher, used advanced
technology to find the submarine, and three months ago he returned
with a group of experts for a close inspection. He and his team
photographed the ship and saw not only her antiaircraft guns but a
glove, a sweater and a pair of binoculars.
</P>
<P>
   A war hero himself, with two Bronze Stars won in two tours of
duty in Vietnam, Tidwell is also a businessman eager to maintain
good relations with the Japanese as he works to recover the two
tons of gold that eluded him on the recent expedition. The 146 bars
are worth about $20 million. Beyond paying off creditors and
expedition costs, Tidwell has not said what he plans to do with the
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys set out to do what Tidwell did'' in looking for
a lost treasure ship, said Richard N. Billings, who is writing a
book about the submarine's discovery. ``He actually found it,
photographed it, honored it and is now returning part of it to the
families.''
</P>
<P>
   Tidwell held his own memorial service for the soldiers when he
was at sea, laying a dark wreath on the choppy waters above the
wreck and a Japanese flag on the side of the sunken submarine
during a dive.
</P>
<P>
   William D. Gordon, one of two Navy pilots credited with sinking
the I-52 and one of three squadron members who were on the recovery
expedition, said Tidwell's respect for the lost men was clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very serious about that,'' said Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Tidwell plans to return to the I-52 perhaps as soon as this
spring to try to recover the gold. He learned of the gold in May
1990 while doing research in the National Archives, when he
stumbled upon a once-secret wartime document that told of I-52's
lost cargo of gold bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing the sub, practically touching it, was for me the peak
of an eight-and-a-half year journey,'' Tidwell said in a statement
soon after the monthlong expedition ended last December.
</P>
<P>
   After finding the ship in 1995, Tidwell began working out the
logistics and assembling the experts for a recovery expedition. He
won financial backing for the venture from James Philippone, a
lawyer in Rochester, N.Y., and the National Geographic Society,
which is producing a television documentary and a magazine article
about the lost submarine.
</P>
<P>
   The I-52 rests in the mid-Atlantic some 1,200 miles west of the
Cape Verde Islands. It is 3.2 miles down, about a mile deeper than
the Titanic.
</P>
<P>
   To get there, Tidwell hired twin Russian submersibles known as
Mir, or Peace. Each Mir carries an array of lights and room for
three people, who peer through small portholes made of thick glass.
</P>
<P>
   Seven times Tidwell's expedition sent the twin Mir submersibles
down to the I-52, surveying the wreck and learning its secrets.
Expedition members say it is well preserved, and spooky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Always in the background, especially when we saw the shoes,
was the fact that those sailors lost their lives and that we were
the first ones to see it in 50 years,'' said Tim McGinnis, an ocean
engineer based in Seattle who was part of the diving team.
</P>
<P>
   Human bodies are thought to disappear relatively quickly in the
deep sea. Over decades, the frigid brine dissolves even bones. But
many objects undergo little or no decay.
</P>
<P>
   Longer than a football field, its conning tower four-stories
high, the I-52 was crossing the Atlantic as a cargo vessel laden
with metals and raw materials for the Nazi war machine. On a
moonless night in June 1944, it was intercepted by an American task
force.
</P>
<P>
   The I-52's exact resting place was long unknown, because
navigation in wartime was often crude. In 1995, Tidwell drew on
American and Russian naval experts to find the I-52, first dangling
a sonar on a long line from a ship and then confirming the
discovery with a tethered camera pod.
</P>
<P>
   After he announced the find, some Japanese officials said the
I-52 and its cargo remained Japanese property. But Tidwell vowed to
press ahead. He was aided, experts say, by Japan's post-war
Constitution, which renounced warships and allowed any Japanese
military forces to engage only in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Tidwell promised that he would return personal
artifacts he was able to raise. The Japanese group receiving them
is the Association of the Bereaved Families of I-52.
</P>
<P>
   The recent expedition began and ended in Las Palmas, in the
Canary Islands. On board the Russian ship Keldysh were three
American servicemen of the Navy's VC-69 squadron of Avenger
bombers, which torpedoed the enemy submarine.
</P>
<P>
   Expedition divers found two large holes in the I-52's side, both
apparently torn by torpedoes. Strewn about the sub were artifacts,
including pots, pans and crew bunks. No gold was found in the
debris field.
</P>
<P>
   The National Geographic documentary is to be shown this fall on
NBC at the same time that the magazine article appears. Under a
contract with National Geographic, Tidwell cannot speak to
reporters until after the two productions appear. In December, the
society released a short news summary about the expedition that
included a statement by Tidwell.
</P>
<P>
   This week in Japan, he is to visit family members and government
ministers and travel to Kure, a port city and naval base near
Hiroshima where the I-52 was built. Billings, the author, said that
the shoes and other personal artifacts recovered would probably go
into a naval museum being built at Kure.
</P>
<P>
   When Tidwell returns to the I-52, he plans to do whatever is
necessary to get the gold, including cutting into the submarine's
side. But his advisers said he planned to do so with the
consideration appropriate for a warship in which many men died.

`BOTTLE' DELIVERS POTENT MESSAGE AT BOX OFFICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
LOS ANGELES -- ``Message in a Bottle'' lured romance-minded
moviegoers to the nation's multiplexes with an estimated $15.5
million at 2,538 theaters during the Friday-Sunday period, studio
sources said Sunday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The opening of Warner Bros.' love story, starring Kevin Costner
and Robin Wright Penn, met industry expectations as the studio
aimed its promotional campaign at female patrons and the date crowd
to take advantage of traditionally solid business leading up to
Valentine's Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Message,'' which has received mixed reviews, could see its
cumulative gross approach $20 million today, since many moviegoers
will be off work in observance of Presidents Day. Film analyst
Arthur Rockwell said it made sense for Warner to schedule the movie
this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The studio kind of lucked out on the calendar this year,'' he
added. ``I don't see this movie as having great legs beyond this
weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend's winner, Paramount's ``Payback,'' finished a close
second with $14.5 million at 2,751 theaters to give Mel Gibson's
project $40.8 million after 10 days. ``The results prove that
Gibson continues to be a huge draw,'' Rockwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's opening of ``My Favorite Martian,'' starring
Christopher Lloyd in an update of the 1960s sitcom, came in third
with $8.4 million at 2,275 sites in a respectable showing that
matched forecasts. Miramax's third weekend of ``She's All That''
followed with $7.7 million at 2,654 screens to top $40 million
overall.
</P>
<P>
   Miramax's ``Shakespeare in Love'' continued its strong
performance with $7.3 million at 1,556 theaters as the studio
nearly doubled the screen count following last week's 13 Academy
Award nominations. Overall gross has almost hit $45 million after
10 weeks and should remain solid through the March 21 Oscar
ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Shakespeare in Love' is basically art-house fare doing big
business, which is what you pray for with those films,'' Rockwell
said. ``The word of mouth should keep carrying it even though the
title will scare some people away.''
</P>
<P>
   New Line's opening of romantic comedy ``Blast From the Past,''
with Brendan Fraser as a young man who has emerged from a lifetime
in a fallout shelter, posted lukewarm results in sixth with $7
million at 2,542 locations.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks SKG's ``Saving Private Ryan,'' relaunched last
weekend, came in seventh with $3.7 million at 1,140 theaters to
push its cumulative take to $199.7 million. The epic is already the
25th-highest domestic grosser of all time and should remain a solid
performer due to its 11 Oscar nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's much-praised ``Rushmore,'' though snubbed in Academy
Awards voting, drew well in eighth with $2.93 million at 563
theaters as the studio added 460 screens. The prep-school comedy
edged Universal's eighth weekend of med-school comedy ``Patch
Adams'' with $2.9 million at 2,110 sites, giving the latter $126.3
million overall.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount's fifth weekend of ``Varsity Blues'' finished 10th
with $2.7 million at 2,036 theaters as the comedy topped a pair of
Best Picture contenders -- Miramax's ``Life Is Beautiful'' with
$2.2 million at 644 screens and 20th Century Fox's ``The Thin Red
Line'' with $1.5 million at 1,306 theaters. Miramax added 443 sites
for ``Life'' while ``Line'' lost 357 locations as the
much-acclaimed war drama continued to face a tough sell at the box
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like you need to be a real film buff to go see `The
Thin Red Line,' '' Rockwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Box office performance this year continued to lag last year's to
date due to the stunning success of ``Titanic,'' which led during
every single weekend of the first quarter on its way to topping
$600 million. ``Despite comparisons being down, overall performance
this year continues to be pretty good,'' Rockwell said. ``It's
respectable if not great.''
</P>
<P>
   Three entries open Friday, none with blockbuster potential --
Fox's comedy ``Office Space,'' Sony's teen horror-comedy
``Jawbreakers'' and Universal's drama ``October Sky.''

 &HT;    Skipped pit may have proved costly for Wallace, Mayfield
 &HT;    By Al Levine and Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Although both drivers say it didn't affect
their finishes in Sunday's Daytona 500, teammates Rusty Wallace and
Jeremey Mayfield didn't pit during a late caution and it may have
proved costly.
</P>
<P>
   After Bobby Hamilton spun into the wall of the backstretch
during the 173rd lap, nearly all of the race leaders headed to pit
row, except Wallace and Mayfield, who had covered 36 laps on their
tires.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gordon, who went on to win his second Daytona 500, took
four tires and fuel during the 174th lap, as did runner-up Dale
Earnhardt.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, who led 104 of the 200 laps in the race, held his lead
until the 190th lap, when Gordon passed him inside on the
frontstretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought the decision was OK,'' Wallace said. ``I still
think the decision was fine. Looking back at it, maybe if I'd had a
little bit more grip in the tires, I might have been able to hold
that bottom line a little bit better. But the car still handled
good. I wasn't having a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield, who led the race twice for a total of seven laps, was
second after 183 laps, but he cut his right, rear tire during the
194th lap and finished a disappointing 20th.
</P>
<P>
   ``Track position is everything in these restrictor-plate
races,'' Mayfield said. ``The tires hadn't shown any wear or
problems, our or Rusty's or anybody else's we knew about. New or
old tires, that thing was cut regardless. We were a lot more
worried about fuel than tires.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield says he isn't second-guessing the decision of his crew
chief, Paul Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd trust whatever Paul Andrews decided, without question,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   NO BULL
</P>
<P>
   Gordon wasn't the only one receiving a $1 million bonus in the
Winston No Bull 5 program. Ray Grimm, a correctional facility
officer from Hagerstown, MD., also received a $1 million bonus
after Gordon won.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't describe how I felt,'' Grimm said. ``It was so tense.
I really couldn't see the whole race from where I was standing.
Until Gordon came across the line, I couldn't stand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Grimm was part of Winston's ``They Win, You Win'' program, which
pairs five fans with five drivers. But Grimm will share his
winnings with the other four participating fans, who, he says, made
a pact before the race to divide the $1 million, regardless of the
winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a pact and I'll live up to it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The No Bull 5 program awards eligible drivers who win one of
five No Bull 5 events _ the Daytona 500 on Sunday; the Las Vegas
400 on March 7; the Coca-Cola 600 in Charlotte, N.C., on May 30;
the Pepsi Southern 500 at Darlington, S.C., on Sept. 5 and the
Winston 500 at Talladega, Ala., on Oct. 17.
</P>
<P>
   The five eligible drivers in Sunday's race _ Gordon, Mayfield,
Dale Jarrett, Terry Labonte and Jimmy Spencer _ were the top five
finishers in last year's final No Bull 5 event _ the Winston 500 at
Talladega.
</P>
<P>
   The top five finishers from Sunday's race will be the five
eligibile drivers for the Las Vegas 400, and five new fans will be
selected from a national sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   Grimm, by the way, was a longtime Earnhardt fan _ until Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   MOVING UP
</P>
<P>
   Bill Elliott of Dawsonville, Ga., made the biggest improvement
Sunday after starting the race in the No. 37 position. Elliott, who
used a provisional to make the field, actually led the race for
seven laps after pitting during lap 123 following a caution.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott's plan was to drive conservatively during the first 50
laps, then change only two tires during pit stops. During the first
green-flag pit stop during the 54th lap, Elliott took only two
tires and moved from 32nd place to eighth.
</P>
<P>
   When he took the lead, Elliott jumped from 10th to the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good car,'' Elliott said. ``Whenever we came out and
were leading the race and kind of hanging in there, I said, `Man,
this is gonna be a pretty good day.' Some of the tape blew off the
front and it slowed the car down at that particular time, but we
were working on getting it all back. But, I think, by that time,
the motor laid down a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   ROOKIE WATCH
</P>
<P>
   Two rookies started the Daytona 500 and only one of them was
running at the end. Tony Stewart in the No. 20 Pontiac started on
the outside pole but finished 28th because of a faulty engine that
sent him to the pits for unscheduled stops. He completed 181 of the
200 laps and earned 11 points to take the early lead in rookie of
the year competition. Elliott Sadler in the No. 21 Ford got caught
up in the 13-car wreck on lap 135 and was eliminated at that point.
He got 10 points toward the rookie award.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of smoke there and I just tried to pick a
hole,'' Sadler said. ``I didn't get out and so we totaled the race
car. It's good, tight racing, but sometimes it gets out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Buckshot Jones, Don Pardus and Stanton Barrett did not make the
field but each earned a point.
</P>
<P>
   HELLO, AGAIN
</P>
<P>
   Michael Waltrip hadn't had a top five finish since 1996, the
third-longest streak in Winston Cup at 86 races, before finishhing
in fifth place in Sunday's Daytona 500. Attrition and a pretty
strong No. 7 Chevrolet had Waltrip nearly in position to win over
the final five laps. Afterward, he was dejected instead of ending
his top-five streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was up to me and I didn't do the job,'' he said. ``I should
have kept Kenny Irwin behind me. I felt like I had a really strong
horse and I let the 28 (Irwin) get up under me. It cost us a chance
to win. I have to get that out of my mind and go on to Rockingham
and build on this. What was it like to be up front at the end? It
sucked the last two laps because I was out of it. But up until then
it was pretty fun.''
</P>
<P>
   PULLING UP THE REAR
</P>
<P>
   John Andretti was out of the race after only 25 laps with a
blown engine. ``I was real patient with it and didn't want to get
into any trouble,'' he said. ``I knew if I kept the fenders on it
we'd be there at the end. Running two by two you can't do anything.
Rather than trying to force the issue, like I did a couple of
times, I just said forget it and thought I'd wait until it got
single file and I'd start moving up then. We didn't get that far.
There's not really a whole lot you can do back there when you start
that far back (36th). You have to patient. We were going to let it
come to us.''
</P>
<P>
   DEMOLITION DERBY
</P>
<P>
   There was one 13-car wreck and two cars that hit the wall. Jimmy
Spencer, in the No. 23 Ford, was out after 121 laps when he lost
control and hit the wall at turn 2. Contenders Dale Jarrett, Jeff
Burton and Terry Labonte were the primary casualties of the
dozen-car accident that began when Jarrett went out of control
after being tapped from behind, apparently by teammate Kenny Irwin.
On lap 173, Bobby Hamilton, in the No. 4 Chevrolet, eliminated
himself when he spun and hit the wall on the backstretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like (Irwin) ran over (Jarrett),'' Sterling Marlin
said of the biggest pileup. ``He turned him around in front of all
of us and there wasn't any place to go. We'd run 100 or so laps and
nothing had happened, so you kind of figured it was going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Jeff Burton: ``I just saw (Jarrett) and (Mayfield) make
contact. Once they made contact, (Jarrett) started sliding. He
almost saved it, but you just can't save it when you get in the
corner like that. From there, it's just everybody trying to miss
the wreck and there's just not enough room. There's not enough room
for that many cars that far up in front of the field to miss that
wreck. It was a little, bitty tap. It wasn't a big hit, but it
doesn't take much at these speeds.''
</P>
<P>
   LOOKING AHEAD
</P>

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ The final laps of the 41st Daytona 500 on
Sunday came down to the two men who have dominated Winston Cup
racing in the 1990s.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was Dale Earnhardt, the old master, against Jeff Gordon, the
young superstar of motor sports. For the last 10 laps, the two
biggest names in NASCAR were bumper to bumper with Gordon leading
the pack.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt did everything he could to get his second consecutive
Daytona 500 victory, trying to maneuver his Goodwrench Chevrolet
past Gordon on the final lap.
</P>
<P>
   But the defending Winston Cup series champion did what few
others would have been able to do, blocking the Intimidator on the
final turn and keeping the DuPont Chevrolet in front to win the
event for the second time in three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to hear anybody say that wasn't an exciting
race,'' Gordon said. ``This is a dream come true for me. To race
Dale Earnhardt down the finish line for the Daytona 500 is just
incredible. He is the best in the business, especially at Daytona.
I had a mirror full out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was on my bumper, and he worked me over big-time. That's
the way he is and shows how bad he wanted to win this race again.
Keeping him behind me was one of the hardest things I've ever had
to do. He did everything he possibly could, but Dale has taught me
lot the last couple of years, and that's how I kept him behind
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Irwin, the 1997 Winston Cup Rookie of the Year, had the
best finish of his career by crossing the line third, just behind
Earnhardt. Mike Skinner, Earnhardt's teammate, also was in the lead
pack and finished fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt waited 20 years to win his first Daytona 500 in 1998,
but Sunday was the fifth time he has finished second.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last 10 laps were pretty exciting,'' Earnhardt said.
``There was some bumping and slamming, and we almost got sideways.
It was pretty physical, and it was awesome just to survive it. We
were happy to get second, but I sure would have liked to be back in
Victory Lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get Skinner with me so we could work together, but
I couldn't. Jeff's car was pretty strong off the corners, and I
just couldn't get there. I just got beat.''
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of more than 200,000 watched Gordon win his third
consecutive Cup event, dating to last season. The 27-year-old
driver also took home a check for $2,172,246, including his third
$1 million Winston No Bull bonus in two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   He also made a millionaire out of Ray Grimm of Hagerstown, Md.,
who won $1 million as the racing fan paired with Gordon in the No
Bull promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon took the lead in dramatic fashion on lap 190 when he went
to the inside at the start-finish line to go three-wide heading for
turn 1. Gordon was down on the apron of the track and managed to
get back in line, with Earnhardt in tow, just before the banking of
the turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went about as far as we could before we got back in line,''
Gordon said. ``It was a pretty aggressive move. If we had still
been that low on the turn, we would have been in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who has won three of the last four Winston Cup titles,
has finished in the top 10 in 21 consecutive races dating to last
June at Michigan, and he has finished in the top five in 20 of
those events.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt, 47, had not finished higher than third in any Cup
race since he won at Daytona one year ago. The seven-time Winston
Cup champion showed his skill Sunday by overcoming an ignition
problem midway through the race that dropped him back to 20th.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't get up to speed for a while,'' Earnhardt said.
``But we switched boxes and ran better.''
</P>
<P>
   An accident by Bobby Hamilton brought out the final caution flag
of the day on lap 173 and the strategic move that changed the
outcome of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Wallace, who led 104 of the 200 laps, was leading, with
Penske-Kranefuss teammate Jeremy Mayfield third and Earnhardt
sandwiched between them. Gordon and Earnhardt joined most of the
cars on the lead lap and came to the pits, but Wallace and Mayfield
elected to stay on the track.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon and Earnhardt each took on four new tires. Wallace and
Mayfield were in front for the restart while Earnhardt was eighth
and Gordon was 10th. But Earnhardt and Gordon quickly worked their
way back to the front while Wallace and Mayfield were falling back.
With 10 laps to go, it was Earnhardt who pushed Gordon to the
front, and they both passed Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe it. I thought I had the thing won,'' said
Wallace, who was making his 17th attempt at winning the Daytona
500. ``I tried to block Gordon, but it was either crash or move
because Gordon was going to come over me.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, who finished eighth in the Miller Lite Ford, did not
question his crew's strategy to stay on the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was the right decision,'' Wallace said. ``The only
thing that lost me the race was Gordon got underneath me, and I
couldn't block him off. I just got freight-trained.''
</P>
<P>
   But the decision clearly cost Mayfield, who cut a tire with six
laps to go and finished 20th.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tires hadn't shown any problems with wear,'' Mayfield
said. ``We were a lot more worried about fuel than tires. We went
for track position, which is everything in restrictor-plate
racing.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon now has won the last two races at Daytona, including the
Pepsi 400 last October. He also has won four of the last five
Winston Cup events.
</P>
<P>
   But beating Earnhardt in a shootout at the end of the Daytona
500 was a victory he will cherish. After they crossed the finish
line, Earnhardt got his car beside Gordon's and bumped him _ a
gentle love-pat gesture of respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dale gave me a little tap, and he waved,'' Gordon said. ``Even
though we battled for the championship in 1995, we didn't have many
tight battles down to the finish of a race. I doubt if anybody in
the grandstands was standing at the end today.''

SPORTS COLUMN: MARVIN MILLER DESERVES TO BE IN THE HALL OF FAME
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One day in the late 1970s, Bowie Kuhn, then the commissioner of
baseball, invited Marvin Miller, then the executive director of the
Major League Players Association, to lunch for the first and only
time. At one point Kuhn said to Miller, his adversary of more than
10 years: ``Look, Marvin, you've beaten the owners at every turn.
And now the owners need a victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, as he recently recalled, couldn't believe his ears.
``Bowie,'' asked Miller, ``are you suggesting I throw the game?''
</P>
<P>
   Miller did not, and the owners continued their losing streak.
The owners lost at every turn, as Kuhn said, because one man had on
his side the insight, the foresight, the experience, the courage
and the style _ unruffled, unflappable, undeterred _ as well as the
U.S. Constitution and labor law. Miller led the players, often at
dramatic junctures, out of virtual subservience and into the
democratic system of America.
</P>
<P>
   A man of medium height, with a mustache and a quiet, patient
demeanor, Miller took over in 1966 as executive director of a
loosely organized group of ballplayers, with assets of a file
cabinet and about $5,400. He shaped them into what many believe is
the most successful union not just in sports, but in the history of
American labor.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did he work to raise the level of earnings _ the
average salary of a major-leaguer when he began was $19,000 a year;
it is now $1.4 million _ but he helped improve playing conditions,
from padded outfield walls and better-defined warning tracks to
safer locker rooms. He even helped improve play, according to Henry
Aaron, allowing players more financial freedom to remain in better
shape during the off season instead of having to work at jobs like
insurance salesman (Aaron) or sporting goods salesman (Andy Pafko).
</P>
<P>
   He was also instrumental in improving scheduling, such as
negating night games on get-away days. And he gave players the
freedom that other American workers had _ his cataclysmic battle
for free agency ended the reserve clause, which had prevented
players from bargaining for their services on the open market. As a
result, a greater number of teams won pennants than ever before,
attendance figures broke records season after season, and the value
of teams increased (the Yankees were purchased for $10 million in
1973 and today are worth $600 million or more).
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, he also took one of the poorest benefit plans and
built it into one of the best.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Bunning, now a U.S. senator and a Baseball Hall of Famer
who, along with Robin Roberts and Harvey Kuenn, led a players'
committee to hire someone to lead their meager union, once said,
``The two proudest things I take out of baseball were the perfect
game I pitched and being part of the selection group that chose
Marvin Miller as executive director.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron, the home-run champion and now senior vice president of
the Atlanta Braves, once said, ``Marvin Miller is as important to
the history of baseball as Jackie Robinson.''
</P>
<P>
   And Roberts, the Hall of Fame pitcher, said: ``I don't know of
anyone who changed the game more than Marvin Miller. His legacy is
that, through his work, ballplayers for the first time attained
dignity from owners. He changed a monopoly into a more realistic
setup. He deserves to be in the Hall of Fame.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks from Monday, on March 2, the Veterans Committee of the
Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., will gather and vote on
the inclusion of new members in their shrine. One of the leading
candidates is Orlando Cepeda, the fine first baseman whose best
slugging years were with the Giants and Cardinals. His recently
published autobiography, ``Baby Bull,'' written with Herb Fagen,
ably presents the case for Cepeda, who was once imprisoned for 10
months in Puerto Rico for possession of marijuana. Cepeda's
baseball accomplishments should merit him selection to the Hall of
Fame, just as Miller's do.
</P>
<P>
   But in his way, Miller, who was born in the Bronx in 1917 and
who retired in 1985 and lives in Manhattan, is as controversial a
choice as Cepeda. Miller is still resented by owners, but shouldn't
be. Owners, who feared a thinning of their substantial pocketbooks,
had presented him as an ogre from the moment he took his position.
He was painted by them as one among ``union goons'' for his work as
chief economist and negotiator for the United Steelworkers.
</P>
<P>
   Kuhn declared on the witness stand in a courtroom that free
agency would ``ruin'' baseball.
</P>
<P>
   When Miller once went to a spring-training camp to talk with
players in an outfield meeting _ they were refused use of the
locker room _ the Astros' manager, Leo Durocher, fungoed baseballs
in an attempt to hit Miller.
</P>
<P>
   But virtually by himself, one decent man, with knowledge and the
mission to do the best job possible, beat the owners with their
teams of lawyers and press agents, time after time after time.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the overwhelming resistance, he helped improve both
the game and the lives of players _ and, as it turned out, the
lives of the owners, as well. And not just in baseball, but,
eventually, in all team sports in this country.
</P>
<P>
   The Veterans Committee would distinguish itself and do what is
right and unequivocally just by voting Marvin Miller into the
Baseball Hall of Fame. &QL;

MEXICANS WELCOME CLINTON, EAGER TO PLEASE A FRIEND 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MERIDA, Mexico _ President Clinton traveled to Mexico on Sunday
for a brief working visit with President Ernesto Zedillo, a trip
that officials described as a friendly stopover aimed mainly at
refreshing the two leaders' cordial relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Zedillo said that during Clinton's 23-hour trip to this
palm-dotted capital of the Yucatan Peninsula they hoped to whittle
away at a broad agenda of pending business, including disputes over
narcotics trafficking and migration.
</P>
<P>
   But the trip seemed mostly intended to please Clinton, two days
after the Senate acquitted him on charges of perjury and
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton has been a good friend to the Mexican people
and our government, both in trying times and in good times,'' a
senior aide to Zedillo said. ``We just want him to enjoy his
stay.''
</P>
<P>
   A joint news conference, initially planned for the close of the
visit on Monday afternoon, was canceled after U.S. officials said
Clinton wanted to take no questions from the press, a Mexican
official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a visit more than anything to reinforce the idea that
there's presidential attention to Mexico at a time some people are
saying the Clinton administration has no Latin American policy,''
said Rafael Fernandez de Castro, a Mexican professor who is a
visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington.
``There'll be a lot of photo opportunities, mostly good-timey
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The two presidents and their wives were to dine together in
private on Sunday night in Merida. On Monday, the presidents are to
have their formal meetings at a restored hacienda outside Merida
before Clinton flies back to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Rebolledo Goot, Mexico's deputy foreign minister, said
modest agreements might result from the meetings, including one
that would increase cross-border airline flights and another aimed
at reducing the deaths of Mexican migrant workers.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials will brief the presidents on Mexico's efforts
to suppress the drug trade. The Clinton administration is due to
deliver its annual judgment on those efforts in coming weeks. The
agenda also includes a review of the North American Free Trade
Agreement.

 TO LEAD NIGERIA FACE OFF IN A BITTER By NORIMITSU ONISHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast _ Nigeria's dominant political party
struggled to agree on its presidential candidate Sunday, a day
before it is required to submit its choice to an election body and
just two weeks before the elections on Feb. 27.
</P>
<P>
   The People's Democratic Party is likely to produce Nigeria's
next president, who would be the first democratically elected
leader in 16 years in Africa's most populous nation. The party has
dominated local and statewide elections in the last two months, and
the other two parties have so far proven unable to move beyond
their regional bases.
</P>
<P>
   The primaries for the People's Democratic Party, which had been
postponed twice, began this evening in Jos, a city in central
Nigeria. They followed a fierce battle between the two main
contenders, Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, a former president who was the
only military ruler to give up power voluntarily, and Alex Ekwueme,
a former vice president in a short-lived civilian administration.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins two weeks from now, one thing now seems certain: a
southerner will be the next president of Nigeria, a country long
dominated by generals from the predominantly Muslim north. Obasanjo
is a Yoruba from the southwest; Ekwueme, an Ibo from the southeast.
The candidates from the other two parties are also southerners.
</P>
<P>
   A consensus recently had emerged among northern politicians that
the presidency would be conceded to the south, which has long felt
politically disenfranchised, especially after the presidential
elections in 1993. Moshood K.O. Abiola, a Yoruba from the
southwest, appeared to win the elections, which were then annulled
by a northern general.
</P>
<P>
   But even the apparently simple act of conceding the presidency
to the south has entailed complex strategic calculations in a
country divided by ethnicity, geography and religion. For the
People's Democratic Party, its two main contenders presented their
own weaknesses and strengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning, it seemed that Obasanjo was unassailable,''
said Clement Nwankwo, chairman of the Transition Monitoring Group,
which has been monitoring the elections. ``But in the last few
days, we were getting reports that the contest would be extremely
keen.''
</P>
<P>
   As a military man trusted by the north, Obasanjo was viewed as
the front runner as soon as he declared his candidacy last fall; he
is considered the choice of the military elite who belong to the
People's Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   But doubts about his national appeal have increased amid a
widespread anti-militarist mood among voters and his increasingly
clear lack of popularity among his own people, the Yoruba, who have
long been suspicious of his ties to the north.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Ekwueme served as vice president in Nigeria's last
civilian government from 1979 to 1983. Although the civilian
administration was regarded as highly corrupt, Ekwueme maintained a
reputation as being clean. What is more, Ekwueme has the strong
backing of his people, the Ibo, who would likely feel alienated
from the People's Democratic Party if he is not chosen as its
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   By law, all three parties had to submit the names of their
candidates by Monday. The People's Democratic Party's delay in
selecting its flag bearer also apparently stemmed from the party's
desire to give as little time as possible to its rivals, the All
People's Party and the Alliance for Democracy, to mount a joint
attack. These two parties have said they will present a common
presidential candidate against the People's Democratic Party,
although it is unclear whether the agency monitoring the elections
will allow them to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The All People's Party also held its primaries Sunday, in the
northern city of Kaduna. Its leaders chose as their candidate,
Ogbonnaya Onu, a former governor of an eastern state who is little
known nationally; the selection must be ratified on Monday by the
delegations from all 36 states.
</P>
<P>
   The Alliance for Democracy already had chosen a former finance
minister, Olu Falae, a Yoruba, as its candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria, which has been ruled by the military for all but 10
years since independence from Britain in 1960, held municipal
elections in December and statewide elections in January. The
presidential elections will be preceded on Feb. 20th by elections
for the national assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The country's military government has pledged to hand over rule
to a civilian government on May 29th, a year after the unexpected
death of Gen. Sani Abacha, whose five-year dictatorship and abuse
of human rights turned Nigeria into an international outcast.
</P>
<P>
   The handover will follow a tumultuous year during which the
equally sudden death of the longtime opposition leader, Abiola,
heightened the country's political crisis. Abacha's successor, Gen.
Abdulsalami Abubakar, defused the situation by implementing a
series of political reforms and by announcing in July that the
military would voluntarily give up power.

EARNHARDT CAN'T GET AROUND A ROADBLOCK NAMED GORDON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Dale Earnhardt looked and sounded like his
old, intimidatin' self all week. He was relaxed, cocky. He walked
with a swagger. He was fast.
</P>
<P>
   He won his Twin 125-mile qualifying race on Thursday and the
International Race of Champions Friday. The familiar bad-guy black
No. 3 Chevy was so fast, handled so well, that Earnhardt took only
49 practice laps all week. Hey, if it ain't broke, no need to fix
it.
</P>
<P>
   The 47-year-old stock-car racing legend hasn't been a factor in
the points race since 1995, but he confidently talked of a second
consecutive Daytona 500 victory and a record-setting eighth Winston
Cup title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give me the equipment and get our team in the shape it needs
to be, and I can win races and win a championship,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt has the equipment. The team is in good shape. Winning
races seems attainable.
</P>
<P>
   But to win a championship you've got to get around Jeff Gordon,
and that just might be the hardest thing to do in sports these
days.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon won the Daytona 500 Sunday, and took the first step
toward a fourth championship in five years, by refusing to let
Earnhardt get around. Gordon kept Earnhardt in his rear-view mirror
for the final 11 laps, matching The Intimidator move for move,
blocking every attempt to pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trying to keep him behind me was one of the toughest things
I've ever had to do in a race car,'' Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   The final few tense, edge-of-the-seat laps _ which saved a race
that was little more than a high-speed, single-file parade for much
of its 200 laps _ were symbolic of the changing of the guard that
began when Gordon won his first championship by holding off
Earnhardt in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt is the past, North Carolina born and bred with blood
lines that extend to the beginning of the sport. He is the favorite
son of the die-hard fans, who wildly cheer his every move.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon is the present, and the future, a
California-by-way-of-Indiana boy, a 27-year-old Jeff-come-lately
who appeals to the sport's newer fans and is a hit in the new
markets, but is roundly booed by the traditionalists.
</P>
<P>
   They boo him, and they don't give him his due. Why does Gordon
win so much? Because, his critics say, Hendrick Motorsports can
afford the best equipment, because he drives for a good team,
because crew chief Ray Evernham is the best in the business.
</P>
<P>
   Why, half the drivers in the garage could win in the No. 24 car.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon did not win Sunday because of equipment, his team or his
crew chief. He won because of good, old-fashioned, Earnhardt-style
driving skill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel like we gave him the fastest car, and I don't
feel like we gave him a lot of help in the pits,'' Evernham said.
``The last 10 or 12 laps, it was the driver.''
</P>
<P>
   In a race where victory often depends on drafting partners, on
finding a friend to stick with you nose-to-tail to cut through the
wind, Gordon got precious little help. If he pulled out to make a
move, he went by himself.
</P>
<P>
   In stock-car lingo that's called being hung out to dry, and
Gordon looked like a piece of laundry all afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've won some championships, they're sure not going to
help you,'' he said. ``It's frustrating. You make a move and think
maybe this guy will go with you, and it's like oh boy, here we go
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, when he finally did get some help, it came from
Earnhardt.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon made a bold move down the front stretch, cutting to the
inside of race leader Rusty Wallace. Mike Skinner, who was running
third, went to the outside and they went three wide.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt ignored Skinner, his teammate, and went with Gordon.
He pushed Gordon to the front, setting up the epic battle over the
final few laps.
</P>
<P>
   The old man tried every trick he knew to get past, tapping
Gordon a couple of times, dropping back to try and break the draft.
But the kid had a few moves of his own, letting off when Earnhardt
did to keep the veteran driver from getting the momentum to make a
run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were the longest 11 laps I've ever run at Daytona,''
Gordon said. ``He was setting me up every single lap trying to get
by me.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Earnhardt still had the swagger. He talked about
going to Rockingham next week to ``start on that championship.''
</P>
<P>
   To do that, though, he'll have to get by Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   And that won't be easy to do.

   SEATTLE _ It is an unusual movement, one that mixes populist and
free-market appeals with the high-technology abbreviations of the
age, like ISP and DSL, and so far, anyway, it seems to have taken
hold mostly in the well-wired cities of the Pacific Northwest. But
in the legal debate over the future of Americans' high-speed
connections to the Internet, some public figures clearly think they
have found a potent political issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pipe, a pipe for critically important information,
and we're simply taking the position that no one should be allowed
to monopolize it,'' said King County Executive Ron Sims, a likely
Democratic contender next year for U.S. Senate. Sims is describing
cable-television lines, which can provide Internet access up to 100
times faster than what most consumers now get through conventional
phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a committee of the County Council here voted
unanimously to reject the transfer of the county cable franchise to
AT&AMP;T. Members said they believed AT&AMP;T would have a monopoly on
cable access to the Internet and should instead be forced to open
the cable lines to other Internet service providers, much as the
telecommunications giant was once required to lease its telephone
lines to competing long-distance carriers.
</P>
<P>
   The same condition has already been imposed by city and county
officials in Portland, Ore., which recently became the first place
in the nation to develop such ``open access'' requirements for
cable lines. That move prompted a legal challenge from AT&AMP;T, and a
similar fracas is expected here if the County Council votes on
Tuesday to adopt its committee's recommendation. County and At&AMP;T
officials said this weekend that they hoped to reach a compromise
that would leave the access issue open for future negotiation and
avoid a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The fight over access to the cable lines is taking place amid a
lobbying blitzkrieg, pitting AT&AMP;T and the huge cable company it is
planning to acquire, Tele-Communications Inc., known as TCI,
against local phone companies and an array of Internet competitors,
including America Online and dozens of smaller Internet service
providers.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also raising a core philosophical issue, one that is
already being debated in other communities around the country and
that will become all the more consequential as Americans
increasingly use their cable lines to connect to the Internet for
work, education, shopping and entertainment. Should the cable
lines, in which private companies have invested billions of
dollars, be treated like public rights-of-way?
</P>
<P>
   To AT&AMP;T, which ultimately plans to pay for cable upgrades in
nearly half the nation's homes, the notion is outrageous. In
addition to suing Portland, the company has pointedly said that it
can hardly move ``as aggressively'' to improve cable service where
it may be forced to lease its lines to competitors. AT&AMP;T also
points out that under its plan, cable consumers will indeed be able
to connect to any Internet provider they want, though they will
have to go through the company's Internet affiliate, known as At
Home, to get there. In AT&AMP;T's depiction, that is hardly different
from the common procedure now, in which a consumer pays the phone
company for a line and pays another company, such as America
Online, for content and access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in many ways, AT&AMP;T may face an uphill battle in the
future to keep total control over its cable lines.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it is hard to be on the other side of a debate in
which public officials are using terms like ``share'' and ``open
access'' and railing against monopolies. In endorsing the rejection
of AT&AMP;T's license, Jane Hague, the chairwoman of the Metropolitan
King County Council budget committee, said: ``Approval of the
merger would place control of local cable and high-speed Internet
access in the hands of one mega-company. Our proposal would protect
the public from predatory pricing.''
</P>
<P>
   For another, in acquiring or contracting with cable-television
providers around the country, AT&AMP;T, which has a relatively good
reputation for customer service, is now allied with some companies
that consumers _ and politicians _ love to revile.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Seattle, for instance, TCI is already embroiled in a
major dispute with both the city and the county over delays in
promised improvements in cable lines and is also the subject of
numerous complaints over customer service.
</P>
<P>
   At a public hearing before the Seattle City Council this month
on how to punish the company for failing to meet its deadlines for
the improvements, angry residents unloaded numerous complaints
about TCI service. One man called the company ``unconscionably bad,
totally irresponsible, arrogant,'' a comment that drew sustained
applause.
</P>
<P>
   No one doubts that cable access to the Internet is a huge and
promising field, in which customers may soon be able to pull up
World Wide Web pages with the ease and immediacy they now enjoy as
they retrieve television channels. Roughly half a million Americans
now have high-speed Internet access at home through cable or phone
lines; by 2002, according to Forrester Research Inc., that number
is expected to grow to 16 million, about 80 percent through cable.
``It's like a fire hose as opposed to an eye dropper,'' said Gary
Gardner, executive director of the Washington Association of
Internet Service Providers (ISPs), a Seattle-based group of
Internet companies around the state that want access to the cable
lines.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T rejects the notion that it is developing any sort of
monopoly on hookups to the Internet anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cable-modem technology is an attractive way of providing
high-speed access, but it is by no means the only way,'' said Scott
Morris, an AT&AMP;T vice president in charge of negotiations with
Seattle officials. ``The sooner At Home is deployed, the more
aggressively local phone companies will roll out DSL, and the more
reasonably they will price it.'' DSL technology, named for digital
subscriber lines, is used for high-speed access over standard
telephone lines.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the company has prevailed for now in hundreds of
communities that have granted approval for it to take over their
local cable franchises from TCI, but regulators in many of those
places say they eventually want to impose ``open access'' rules on
cable.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Seattle, the City Council, also due to vote on license
approval Tuesday, appears ready to say yes, with the general
understanding that it may negotiate access rules later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does absolutely no good for anybody in Seattle to have TCI
and AT&AMP;T not invest money here, to have them stop because they're
stuck in litigation,'' said Tina Podlodowski, a former Microsoft
executive who is now chair of the City Council's public safety,
health and technology committee, which oversees cable matters.
Federal regulators have taken much the same position for now,
saying they don't want to do anything that would deter companies
like AT&AMP;T from upgrading cable lines.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T also says that even providing for ``open access'' would be
far more complicated and expensive than opening up its
long-distance lines was, a contention that other Internet companies
reject. ``Feasibility, schmeasibility,'' said Chris Miller, an
employee of Mindspring, a rival Internet service provider, at the
recent City Council hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, of AT&AMP;T, said new regulations would hamper access for
everybody and were unnecessary. ``The whole point here is, the
Internet is morphing even as we speak,'' he said in an interview.
``Yesterday's Internet is not today's, and it certainly won't be
tomorrow's.''
</P>
<P>
   But that has not stopped hundreds of people here, in an
impassioned campaign partly whipped up by AT&AMP;T's Internet
competitors, from flooding city and county officials with letters
and e-mail messages, imploring them to require open access for
cable lines. Sims, the county executive, shared many of those
e-mails, including one in rhyme: ``I need to pick my own Web
provider,'' wrote one of his constituents, ``not limited by a cable
service monopolizer.''

HOUSTON'S SHOOTING SLUMP CONCERNS KNICKS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By RON DICKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ Even when Allan Houston was not being guarded
Sunday, his shooting rhythm looked off. While the Knick assistant
coach Tom Thibodeau fetched the rebounds at SUNY-Purchase, Houston
uncorked 3-pointer after 3-pointer. Instead of the
swish-swish-swish one would expect of a natural jump shot artist
like Houston, he would make a few, then clang just as many off the
front of the rim. The pattern continued during the brief
shoot-around.
</P>
<P>
   The games have been even more telling. Houston is shooting 38
percent (23 of 61) from the field, and he is 1 of 9 from 3-point
range. He is averaging 14.8 points. The numbers take on a glaring
significance after the heel injury to Latrell Sprewell, the latest
player the Knicks hoped would take the scoring burden off center
Patrick Ewing. Sprewell will be sidelined for three to six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Latrell being out changes Allan's importance,''
Coach Jeff Van Gundy said Sunday after a sluggish workout by the
Knicks. ``He's our only guy who's a pure shooter on the team. We
need him to be productive.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday afternoon, Houston will look for his former touch
against his former team, the Detroit Pistons (3-2), at Madison
Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy said the shortened 50-game season would not afford
Houston, a notoriously slow starter, a lot of time to snap out of
his spell. Even a short-term drop in production could be a
long-term detriment. Especially with Ewing (42 percent) and Larry
Johnson (43 percent) struggling with their shooting. Especially in
a stretch of four games in five days.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy feels Houston is shooting the ball with a flat
trajectory. Houston, who showed signs of his former self with 9
points in the fourth quarter against Chicago last Thursday, said
the solution was to create better opportunities for his talents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really feel it's because I'm not getting shots up,''
he said. ``It's just a matter of making them count, and making
shots that are good for me. I'm working in practice on taking shots
that are decisive for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson will guard the Pistons' small forward deluxe, Grant
Hill, who is averaging 29.6 points, giving Houston more energy to
exorcise his shooting demons against the club with which he spent
his first three years in the National Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have to be lying to say I don't want to play well against
them, but it's not an emotional game for me anymore,'' said
Houston, who admitted to pressing against his former teammates in
the past. In the Knicks' four-game split with Detroit last season,
Houston connected on just 28 percent (14 of 50) of his field-goal
attempts.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks, who have won their two games to even their record at
2-2, will have far more to worry about than bygone relationships
against Detroit. The Pistons will be hungry after losing two
straight, and they rely on a slashing offense that could land the
Knicks in foul trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Hill and Jerry Stackhouse (19.8 points) are second and third in
the league in free throws made, with 48 and 42, respectively. The
message is clear to Houston, who has been inhibited by foul woes in
two games and will undoubtedly join the rotation trying to stop the
pair.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I need to do is not use my hands as much,'' Houston
said. ``Sometimes I bailed out an opponent by using my hands.''
</P>
<P>
   When New York signed Houston as a free agent in July 1996, it
was not for his ability to shut down his man. It was for his
accuracy from the perimeter, which had been a desert for the
grind-it-out Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to fit in with a new team that was stuck in old ways,
Houston averaged 14.8 points in 1996-97. With Ewing out for most of
last season, Houston increased his output to 18.4, then to 21.1 in
the playoffs while Ewing played his 35-year-old body and tender
wrist back into shape.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the team has lost a proven point-maker. Again, Houston
will have to respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it is when you make up your mind that you're going to
shoot the ball, no matter if you make or miss,'' Houston said.
``That's when you're more effective as a scorer.'' &QL;

   LOS ANGELES: system that reroutes motorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the future, your car is going to have something that sends
out a signal to a satellite and the satellite will be able to see
how fast cars are going everywhere, and your dashboard will
recommend different things to different cars,'' Brian Schwartz
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Federally funded studies are attempting to develop computer
simulations that mimic traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz prefers the practical, explaining his 19-year rise from
counting cars to first deputy commissioner for the New York City
transportation department.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to translate between the esoteric scientists and the
lay people,'' Schwartz explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went to a party and said I was a physicist, they would
yawn. When I said I was the traffic commissioner, they would line
up,'' he recalled. ``Everyone's a traffic expert.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Gridlock is an example of the theoretical translated to the
practical.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz's mathematical definition for gridlock shows vehicle
speeds decline with more vehicles in motion, ultimately reaching
zero.
</P>
<P>
   The term came before the theory. He and a colleague were
studying the prospect of converting Manhattan streets to pedestrian
malls. ``We talked about the grid system locking up.''
</P>
<P>
   The term, though, didn't gain notice until Schwartz launched a
gridlock prevention program to prepare for a transit strike in the
mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Notable wordsmith William Safire of the New York Times wrote in
April 1980, ``Such a word cannot miss. Gridlock is a fine neologism
for the automobile Armageddon. Gridlock is to highway engineers
what nuclear meltdown is to nuclear engineers.''
</P>
<P>
   Gridlock did give a definition the Schwartz brothers figure
might literally become true in many urban areas -- total paralysis
of traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever alternatives Los Angeles finally chooses, the Schwartz
brothers say they will be watching the freeways -- and learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have more of them, and I think it gives L.A. its
character,'' Sam Schwartz said. ``If you're studying traffic
nationally or internationally, you will make a stop in L.A. and you
will make a stop in New York.''

TRAFFIC-BUFF BROTHERS USE L.A. AS LABORATORY FOR GRIDLOCK
SOLUTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY MICHAEL COIT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Dear Gridlock Sam: ``Why does Los Angeles have
the worst traffic in the United States, and what can be done about
it?''
</P>
<P>
   Gridlock Sam: ``You hold a reign that the Chicago Bulls would be
proud of. Most people in L.A. live behind the wheel. The freeways
are very wide, but they're still full. Jams are common there
because you have a very high density of cars and lots of potential
disturbances because you have a lot of freeway connections.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The larger answer to urban traffic problems is: fewer
vehicles. If we believe we can `highway' ourselves out of the
problem -- we will only buy time out of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   These words of traffic wisdom come from Sam Schwartz, a former
New York City traffic commissioner who coined the word ``gridlock''
and is known in his newspaper column as Gridlock Sam. He and his
physicist brother, Brian, make their living studying the wheres and
whys of traffic, using the freeways of Los Angeles and New York as
their laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   They see one critical solution for L.A.'s infamous traffic: GET
PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR CARS!
</P>
<P>
   The brothers also suggest that Los Angeles should improve its
bus system to draw more commuters and place high-occupancy toll
lanes on freeways to charge motorists for a congestion alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the brothers Schwartz are only cautiously optimistic.
They recognize this is the land of cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Motorists still have the Wild West spirit, and the car is
equivalent to the horse, and nobody's going to mess with my
horse,'' Sam Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Schwartz, a Brooklyn College physics professor, believes
that building more lanes will bring bigger traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
   With freeways more jammed than free-flowing anymore, he said Los
Angeles is leading the way in the nation's increasing immobility.
Motorists will be forced to find alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have many different solutions. They may decide to work
at home, they may decide to car pool, they may decide to tackle
public transportation, they may move. Now, when you open another
lane, they go back,'' he said. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Like a river carrying a certain volume of water, freeways are
designed to carry a limited number of vehicles, some 2,000 cars per
lane per hour at best.
</P>
<P>
   They flow smoothly when there's plenty of room and slow down and
become turbulent when there is an obstruction -- wrecks, roadwork
and merging traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``As traffic becomes more dense, what can happen is now the
interaction increases where you can go from a liquid flowing to a
solid. No two atoms can be in the same place at the same time. No
two cars can be in the same place at the same time,'' said Brian
Schwartz, a consultant to the American Physical Society.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are a lot of cars, just by the period of time and
interaction, when one car slows down, it causes the car behind it
to slow down and it slows down a little more subtly and the one
behind it slows even a little more subtly. Ultimately, it
propagates a traffic jam,'' he said. ``The little disturbance gets
amplified.''
</P>
<P>
   Get ready for more disturbances, the brothers predict.
</P>
<P>
   The population in Southern California is expected to rise by 43
percent, as compared with an 11 percent increase in freeway lanes
through 2020, according to the Southern California Association of
Governments' most recent regional transportation plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're already one of the largest industrial areas in the
metropolitan world and one of the most spacious areas,'' said Bob
Huddy, a veteran transportation planner with SCAG. ``There are not
many one-size-fits-all solutions.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Transportation planners from the Reason Public Policy Institute
have endorsed the idea of high-occupancy toll lanes as one of the
best solutions to traffic problems in Los Angeles. A SCAG-sponsored
task force found the lanes made sense as a type of congestion
pricing.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Schwartz agrees.
</P>
<P>
   As a former New York City traffic commissioner, he is accustomed
to pushing unpopular ideas that favor public transit and vehicles
carrying more than the driver, or putting a price on time-saving
routes.
</P>
<P>
   Charging motorists for driving in Manhattan was a particularly
controversial proposal in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I nearly got tarred and feathered,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some toll routes started around construction projects remain
today in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real beauty of it is you can guarantee people reliability
in traffic, which is unheard of,'' Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
   High-occupancy toll lanes would be expensive enough to keep down
demand so they don't become overloaded and lose the time-saving
advantage. The lanes also carry car pools, van pools and buses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like nothing better than watching people in transit smiling
at people stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic,'' Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
   Creating dedicated bus lanes also would do much to ease traffic.
``Now I don't think it would be welcomed in L.A., but I have often
taken lanes away from general traffic and given it to public
transit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe motorists can be needled into changing solo-driving
habits. That was one of Schwartz's techniques as traffic
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled posting a sign where traffic jammed on an elevated
highway connecting Manhattan and Staten Island that read:
``Wouldn't you rather be riding the ferry now?'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Southern Californians who question the value of car-pool lanes
will find an ally in Sam Schwartz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have yet to find a car-pool lane that achieves its goal to
have fewer vehicles overall,'' he contended.
</P>
<P>
   New technology has arrived that could cut commute times,
including a computer system that reroutes motorists.

COMMENTARY: THE DICTATOR SPEAKS: A CHAT WITH LEE KUAN YEW
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In blurbing the memoirs of the dictator of
Singapore, President George Bush gushed: ``Senior Minister Lee Kuan
Yew is one of the brightest, ablest men I have ever met.'' Baroness
Thatcher: ``He was never wrong.'' Henry Kissinger: ``One of the
seminal figures of Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite this adulation, a vituperative right-wing calumniator
regularly denounces Lee for using lap dog judges to silence
internal opposition and intimidate journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``'You call me a dictator,'' Senior Minister Lee said when we
recently met at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
``You are entitled to call me whatever you like, but that doesn't
make me one ... do I need to be a dictator when I can win, hands
down?''
</P>
<P>
   He brought up the example of Chee Soon Juan, 36, a
neuropsychologist who dared to run for Parliament. After being
fired from his job and losing his home, Chee was arrested for
breaching the Public Entertainment Act by trying to make a speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was this little fuss about a dissident,'' said the
dictator, ``who said, `I'm going to speak at Raffles Place,' which
is our business center, without a permit. So why didn't we let him
speak?
</P>
<P>
   ``I said the law has been on the statutes for the last 50 years.
If everybody just turns up at a busy junction at lunch time and
makes a speech and runs around ... there would be pandemonium. We
are not that kind of society.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Nye, head of Harvard's Kennedy School, suggested that
Singapore set aside a place like London's old Hyde Park Corner
where people gathered to hear speakers sound off freely. Lee
promises: ``We'll probably do it.'' That'll be the day.
</P>
<P>
   The dissident Chee was fined the equivalent of $800, refused to
pay, spent a week in jail and faces further harassment. I asked: if
not worried about opposition, why fine him at all?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the laws are there, and he has complied with those
laws for the last eight years. Since 1992 he has been campaigning.
And now, because he has lost, and lost badly in an open, free
election, one to one against one of our candidates, he's had
exposure on television, which was disastrous for him because he was
caught out lying and fibbing and fabricating evidence on a health
care paper. ... So he gets a big splash in the Western press,
because they want to beat me up. It's all right; it doesn't bother
me.''
</P>
<P>
   When dissidents say ``liar,'' they are driven into exile;
obviously a free press bothers him plenty. ``We do not own the
[Singapore) press, as they do in Malaysia. Nobody is allowed to own
more than 3 percent of the shares. The management of the press is
in the hands of our four big banks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And that makes all of them terrified of crossing you.''
</P>

party. Why does he fear political contests?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are seven or eight parties that contested the last
elections. They lost because they cannot produce an alternative
more attractive to the electorate than us. Look: Nobody in his
right mind believes that we rigged elections.''

<P>
   As one of the legion not in his right mind, I asked: How about
free labor unions?

   The determinedly irreplaceable Lee Kuan Yew is the world's most
intelligent, and to some most likable, despot. In our hour's talk,
he offered insights about China to be reported in a future column,

RANGERS' PLAYOFF BID JOLTED BY A LOSS AND ANOTHER INJURY
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The first Ranger shot Sunday afternoon, by Brent
Fedyk, clanged off the Detroit goal post and stayed out of the net.
At the other end of Madison Square Garden, the first Red Wing shot
crossed the goal line and lit the red light behind Mike Richter.
From there on, it was just a matter of time, effort and superior
talent before the two-time defending Stanley Cup champions took a
4-2 victory over the Rangers, although the triumph was not secure
until the Red Wings scored into the empty net in the final minute.
</P>
<P>
   It was bad enough that the Rangers lost their third consecutive
game on a day when they could have gained ground on their idle
rivals in the Eastern Conference playoff race. But other
developments made it worse, much worse, for a reeling team whose
season could quickly slip away, with five more games in the next
eight days.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Popovic, the big defenseman, who was beaten on the first
goal, by Sergei Fedorov, spent most of the day in a hospital with
blood in his right eye after he blocked a shot with his face. He
went home later, and his injury will be evaluated Monday. The
Rangers are already without Jeff Beukeboom, another defenseman, who
missed his second consecutive game with his second concussion of
the season. Beukeboom is not expected to play against the
Predators, Coach John Muckler said.
</P>
<P>
   On the forward line, Todd Harvey missed the third period with a
fractured right thumb, an injury suffered against Carolina on
Friday night, which was his first game back after missing the
previous 10 with a knee injury. His status is day-to-day, the
Rangers said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Rangers who played, it was a difficult afternoon,
particularly after they fell behind by three goals in the first
period. Richter, who gave them up, was replaced by Dan Cloutier.
Muckler said Cloutier will start in Nashville. Wayne Gretzky, who
went without a point for the third consecutive game, finished with
a minus-3 in the plus/minus ratio, dropping him to a minus-18,
worst on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Leetch, whose three-game goal-scoring streak ended,
attacked the net repeatedly and may have been New York's best
player. He was on the ice for nearly 36 minutes. His reward, in the
closing minutes, was a legal, crunching shot into the boards on a
Kirk Maltby check, a hit that left his teammates trying, without
much success, for vengeance. Petr Nedved, fighting a scoring slump,
created numerous chances for naught. Chris Osgood, the Detroit
goalie, robbed him four times and the cross bar stopped him another
time.
</P>
<P>
   With 29 games remaining in an 82-game schedule, the Rangers
remain in 12th place in an Eastern Conference that will send only
eight teams to the post-season tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Muckler, asked if he thought his team deserved to make the
playoffs, replied, ``Yes, I think we deserve to be in the playoffs
if we can get some wins together. I don't see the other teams _
Boston and Florida _ really setting the world on fire here. We're
six points out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   That much is true. And the Rangers have as many victories as the
eighth-place Panthers, and they have a game in hand on the
ninth-place Bruins.They also have three games in hand on 10th-place
Montreal and are only one point behind 11th-place Washington. And
yet they have lost 9 of their last 12 games and are 6 games below
.500, their lowest mark of the season. And if they make the
playoffs, they deserve a parade, at least from Seventh Avenue to
Eighth Avenue, if any of them are still healthy enough to sit up in
the convertibles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no excuses,'' said Adam Graves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe tomorrow,'' said Fedyk, who scored one of the Ranger
goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't quit,'' said Leetch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fighting for our lives,'' said Cloutier.
</P>
<P>
   He also fought a bit with Slava Kozlov, a Detroit forward. After
they collided, Cloutier put Kozlov in a leg lock and rolled over on
him while other Rangers raced the other way. This came late in the
second period, after Marc Savard's eighth goal of the season cut
the lead to 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   These two elements energized the crowd and set up a tense third
period that got better when Fedyk scored his third of the season to
cut the lead to 3-2 at 4:30. But after Cloutier was pulled for an
extra attacker, Niklas Listrom sank the puck into the empty net.
Yzerman and Petr Klima scored the other Detroit goals.

RESERVES MAKING MOST OF VALUABLE PLAYING TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Dan Keczmer didn't get to sun himself in
Southern California last week.
</P>
<P>
   While the rest of his Stars teammates were bonding on a vacation
trip to Newport Beach, Keczmer was busy catching a flight to
Kalamazoo, Mich., returning to Dallas and then flying to Houston _
all so he could play three games at the minor-league level. Not the
kind of stuff a 30-year-old father of two considers fun, but for
Keczmer, there was no disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I'd fly to the North Pole if it meant playing,'' Keczmer
said.
</P>
<P>
   That attitude showed on the ice for both Keczmer and Brent
Severyn on Saturday night. For only the fifth time this season, the
two role players worked themselves into the lineup for the same
game. And for the first time, they played on the same line. The
combination proved electric as the duo played only six minutes but
dished out big hits, dominated control of the puck and sent a sense
of urgency to their teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have that desperation in their game,'' defenseman Richard
Matvichuk said. ``They're out there working hard and trying to
prove something every shift, and that's a great way to play. It's
contagious.''
</P>
<P>
   Severyn, a fighter acquired in the off-season, played in only
his 13th game. Keczmer, a journeyman defenseman who has been
shifted to left wing, played his 20th game. The two typically don't
know if they're going to play until the day of the game and they
have to be ready no matter what. Keczmer, in fact, was told during
pregame warmups Saturday that he would play after Mike Keane's sore
ankle flared up.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, both were ready to deliver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and Sevy, we're both in the same position,'' Keczmer said.
``We know whenever we get the chance to come in, we have to play
hard, play smart and play defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, we're not going to get a lot of free chances,'' Severyn
said. ``We can't afford to not play well when we get in.''
</P>
<P>
   Combined with center Guy Carbonneau, the Stars' fourth line
played extremely well, helping inject energy into the team when it
lost a two-goal lead in a 40-second span during the second period.
In fact, Carbonneau scored the game-winning goal off assists by
Severyn and Keczmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's exactly what we need from our third and fourth lines,
hard-working play, and they gave us that,'' Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock said. ``Desperate or whatever you want to call it,
everyone should play like that.''
</P>
<P>
   With Keane day-to-day on his sore ankle and Hitchcock recalling
young winger Jason Botterill yesterday, it's still up in the air
whether the coach will keep Keczmer and Severyn on the same line.
And while the duo did a remarkable job in a short period of time,
it's difficult enough to get one of them into the lineup on a
consistent basis, let alone two.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know this was just one game, and it could change
tomorrow,'' Severyn said. ``We know he has some tough decisions to
make, and we just have to be ready to play when our time comes.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Stars needing more of a physical presence from their
wingers, a couple of journeymen could make it extra tough on a man
who could be controlling the deepest roster in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I have no problem putting them in the game together, even
if it means pulling out some of our other players,'' Hitchcock
said. ``Competition within the team can only make us better.''
BOTTERILL RETURNS The Stars yesterday recalled Botterill from the
Michigan K-Wings of the International Hockey League. Botterill, 22,
played four games with the Stars last season but has not played a
game with them this season. He has eight goals and 13 assists for
21 points with the K-Wings. Hitchcock said he will decide today
whether he will play Botterill against the Edmonton Oilers tonight.

RANGERS' BOSS NOT AT LOSS IN MAKING ALL THE RIGHT MOVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ If Steinbrenner owned the Rangers, Randy
Johnson or Roger Clemens would be mansion-hunting in the Metroplex
right now. Maybe even both. Steinbrenner has never been one to
finish second in any wild spending spree.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Hicks is The Boss around here, and the Rangers declined
to outrageously overpay for a 35-year-old pitcher with a history of
a bad back, volatile temper and a tendency to quit on his team when
things don't go his way. Nor did they mortgage the farm system or
give away half the team for a 36-year-old pitcher who may still
have it but who also wanted a one-year $27 million contract
extension.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good as far as Hicks owning the Rangers. The man
isn't out of control, at least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   His much-anticipated first off-season heading up the Rangers was
not marked by any wild spending sprees, but by the cool
professionalism necessary for a franchise to maintain consistent
success. The old Los Angeles Dodgers, Toronto Blue Jays and Oakland
Athletics were known for just that.
</P>
<P>
   Sanity prevailed. The right decisions were made. General manager
Doug Melvin was allowed to do his job in his usual calm and
meticulous manner.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the shortstop was re-signed, power was added to the
lineup and starting pitching depth was added at a reasonable price.
Remember, Johnson would likely have meant no Rafael Palmeiro and
Clemens ultimately would have cost Rusty Greer, Rick Helling and
Ruben Mateo.
</P>
<P>
   The only sign of unnecessary ownership meddling was the
acquistion of one Heisman Trophy running back who has virtually no
chance of playing in the major leagues. Melvin's protestations
aside, it's hard to believe Ricky Williams would be in the Rangers'
spring training camp if Hicks had gone to Midwestern State
University.
</P>
<P>
   Actually though it could be worse. The Rangers could have Garth
Brooks coming to camp. Imagine a major-league baseball franchise
crazy enough to have a country-western singer hanging around.
</P>
<P>
   The point is the Rangers don't need another Steinbrenner. They
don't need another ego-crazed Peter Angelos or Ted Turner serving
as manager for a day. They don't need an owner who feels it's his
prerogative to hire and fire pitching coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Steinbrenner, taking advantage of the huge financial
advantages in New York, has won four World Series titles, two in
the '70s and two more in the past three years. But both times it
took Steinbrenner getting suspended for two years, allowing the
Yankees' real baseball people to do their jobs properly. The
Yankees did almost nothing in the '80s while Steinbrenner was
allegedly behaving himself.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Hicks has shown no signs of handing out illegal campaign
contributions or consorting with known gamblers, as Steinbrenner
did.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks does want to win a World Series and has conveniently made
that perfectly clear to manager Johnny Oates. But he also does seem
to have a clue.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Schieffer, unlike Tex Schramm or Norm Sonju, has survived
the ownership change. Melvin still seems to have final say in the
baseball decisions. Hicks does know who Mateo, Corey Lee and Kelly
Dransfeldt are and what they mean to the future of the franchise.
He has heard of the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   For all of Hicks' billions and all the financial advantages
offered by The Ballpark, the Rangers aren't going to catch up to
the Yankees by spending as much money as possible. The Yankees win
that battle. Always have, always will.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks needs to make sure the Rangers are spending enough money
in scouting and player development to ensure a viable farm system.
He needs to make sure the Rangers stay strong in Latin America as
well as become a player in the rapidly growing Asian talent market.
</P>
<P>
   He needs to make sure his very-capable manager _ who is as good,
if not better than Joe Torre _ and hard-working coaches don't have
to be fearful for their jobs. He needs to make sure the Rangers
have the best amateur scouts around.
</P>
<P>
   He needs to make sure the home-grown talent stays here and is
not pitching the Florida Marlins or the San Diego Padres into the
World Series. The Rangers, who did the right thing with Helling,
needed to spend more time this off-season talking about Juan
Gonzalez and less about Johnson and Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin knows how to do his job. So does Oates. The Rangers need
an owner not just with billions of dollars in pocket change but who
also dictates the proper philosophy, then lets the right people do
their job.
</P>
<P>
   That's not Steinbrenner's way. But it's the right way. /

BISHOP NOT VIEWED AS NFL PROSPECT BY MANY SCOUTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Michael Bishop finds himself awash in mixed
messages as he prepares to make the transition from college to
professional football.
</P>
<P>
   The runner-up in balloting for the 1998 Heisman Trophy, Bishop
will be at the Fort Worth Club tonight to receive the Davey O'Brien
National Quarterback Award, a trophy bestowed annually to the top
quarterback in college football. Yet few NFL scouts and draft
analysts rank the former Kansas State standout among the top six
prospects at his position in the 1999 NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   Check out the top 50 players, as rated by ESPN draft analyst Mel
Kiper, and there are four quarterbacks: Kentucky's Tim Couch (No.
2), Syracuse's Donovan McNabb (No. 5), Oregon's Akili Smith (No.
13) and Central Florida's Daunte Culpepper (No. 23). But no Bishop.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sporting News'' ranks Bishop seventh among quarterbacks in
the draft pool, behind the Fab Four identified by Kiper, as well as
UCLA's Cade McNown and Washington's Brock Huard.
</P>
<P>
   Several NFL scouts confirmed that such assessments reflect the
majority opinion within the league, where Bishop is considered too
short (6-foot-1) and too quick to scramble (14.8 carries per game
in 1998) to match the protoype for an NFL quarterback. Most target
him as a third- to fifth-round pick.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Bishop said he's been urged to switch positions by
scouts from the Tennessee Titans and Arizona Cardinals. If his NFL
future is dependent upon a position switch, Bishop said he is
willing. But he is counting on some NFL team believing in his
potential at quarterback as much as he does.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I get there and get the opportunity to play, there's no
doubt in my mind that I'm going to sit back some day and laugh
about all the people who think I can't be an NFL quarterback,''
Bishop said. ``I'll be one of the greatest quarterbacks ever to
come through the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop already has one of the greatest single-season production
jumps of any college quarterback. In 1997, Bishop's first year in
Division I-A after winning consecutive national championships at
Blinn Junior College, he completed 43.4 percent of his passes.
Bishop improved to 55.6 percent last season, throwing for 2,844
yards with a touchdowns-to-interceptions ratio of 23-4.
</P>
<P>
   Combine that with his 748 rushing yards, said Kansas State coach
Bill Snyder, and the numbers suggest a quarterback who has the
tools to succeed in the NFL, where mobile quarterbacks are becoming
more desirable ... as long as they don't disrupt the offense by
running too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``The days of having a quarterback like Dan Marino, who can't
hurt you by scrambling, are endangered,'' said Cowboys' scout
Walter Julif. ``The reason mobile quarterbacks are in vogue is
because of the salary cap. You can't put put together an offensive
line any more without some holes in it. So you'd better have
someone back there who can move.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop, a 4.5 sprinter in the 40-yard dash, certainly qualifies
on the mobility scale. He also ranks high in arm strength, work
ethic and intangibles. During the East-West Shrine Game, where he
received 34 of 37 votes to be a team captain, he volunteered to
cover kickoffs. In four seasons as a starting quarterback at the
college level, Bishop compiled a record of 46-3.
</P>
<P>
   But scouts point to his frequent early departures from the
pocket and question his ability to read defenses. Terry Bradway,
director of personnel for the Kansas City Chiefs, predicted
Bishop's draft-day destiny rests in how well he explains his
on-field decisions while reviewing videotapes with NFL coaches
between now and April.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the spring, you get to understand what he knows and what
his thought process is,'' Bradway said.
</P>
<P>
   Some envision greener pastures for Bishop in the Canadian
Football League, where the wider field and less-structured offenses
are more suited to his freelance style.
</P>
<P>
   If Bishop wants to continue in his quest as a quarterback, said
ESPN college football analyst Lee Corso, he ``should go to the CFL
and make $8 billion.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Cowboys personnel director Gil Brandt, who spent a week
with Bishop at the East-West Shrine Game, praised Bishop's arm
strength and leadership abilities. As an athlete, Brandt said
Bishop has the physical tools to shift to cornerback and ``have as
much dominance on the game as any of the top cornerbacks in the
league, other than Deion \RSanders\S.''
</P>
<P>
   But, quarterback?
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, I don't know if he can be an NFL quarterback,''
Brandt said. ``Does he learn 19 different formations and what to do
against 37 different defenses? I'm not sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop is convinced he can do it, but would prefer to ease into
the position after spending a season or two learning from a
veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that, I'll be ready to explode,'' Bishop said.
</P>
<P>
   Craig James, college football analyst for CBS, said Bishop is
the type of player who would benefit from spending the spring in
the NFL's European training league. Although he identified Bishop
as an athlete with the physical tools to play safety or wide
receiver in the NFL, James said Bishop belongs at quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be the best example of a guy you've got to throw out
the standard requirements for being an NFL quarterback ... since
Doug Flutie,'' said James, who was a teammate of Flutie's with the
New England Patriots. ``What both of those guys have is an ability
to win games. Doug just wins, regardless of the situation. I think
the same thing will happen with Bishop.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a linebacker's mentality that he's going to have to
throttle down at times. He'll have to learn not to force things to
happen in the NFL, where there are 10 guys around him as good or
better than he is. But he'll be a success for somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as that happens, Bishop said he doesn't mind if he's
taken in the fifth round. Or later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't bother me at all, as long as I get a chance,''
Bishop said. ``When I do, the people that questioned my ability
might look a lot like the people who questioned Randy Moss.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss, lest anyone forget, has a Rookie of the Year award to
remind his critics they were wrong. Bishop, at this point, has a
Davey O'Brien Award that suggests he can't be taken lightly,
either.

   KIEV, Ukraine _ Pavlo Lazarenko, the former Ukrainian prime
minister, now a member of Parliament, party leader and presidential
candidate, says someone is out to get him. Actually, he says the
current president of Ukraine, Leonid Kuchma, is out to get him.
</P>
<P>
   How else to explain what befell Lazarenko on Dec. 2?
</P>
<P>
   The facts are simple enough. As Lazarenko tells it, he was
crossing the Swiss border into Basel (a trip to meet lawyers) in a
Mercedes (not his) when the Swiss police seized his Panamanian
passport (a convenience for frequent travelers like himself) and
accused him of laundering millions of dollars through Swiss bank
accounts (Ukraine's confiscatory tax laws are driving perfectly
good money into offshore havens).
</P>
<P>
   The press in Ukraine's capital, Kiev, has since been filled with
leaked accusations _ about sweetheart deals involving sales to the
government of prefabricated housing; about a curious swap of cows
for silicon manganese, a tough alloy used in industrial products;
about Lazarenko's role in granting certain companies breathtakingly
lucrative monopolies on the sale of natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   The sum of these reports is that Lazarenko has supposedly been
siphoning government money into his offshore accounts for years _
long enough, some reports charge, to make him a billionaire.
</P>
<P>
   Lies, all lies, he said in an interview a few days ago. Or if
true, completely legal.
</P>
<P>
   Lazarenko said he plans an announcement on Wednesday that will
make clear his adherence to Ukrainian law. In the meantime, ``I can
absolutely state that I have not violated any law of Switzerland,
and that this is nothing but political harassment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he is guilty or not, few doubt that politics played a
major role in Lazarenko's arrest. High-level corruption is epidemic
in Ukraine, but serious investigations of corruption are rare and
arrests like this one are almost unheard of without good political
cause. Lazarenko has been giving the Kuchma government cause ever
since the day Kuchma dismissed him as prime minister 20 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of Ukraine's political kingpins, Lazarenko and the
president both sprang from the same east Ukrainian region of
Dnepropetrovsk, an industrial stronghold during Soviet times. Now
46, Lazarenko started work as a driver on a collective farm. In
short order he ran the farm, then Dnepropetrovsk's agricultural
industry and finally, in 1992, the entire region.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Kuchma named him prime minister in July 1996,
Lazarenko had been elected to Parliament and accumulated his own
power base. Precisely why their relationship soured is not clear;
Ukrainian news reports suggest that Lazarenko proved too
headstrong, and increasing reports of his involvement in corruption
may have proved embarrassing as well.
</P>
<P>
   Within months, Kuchma was publicly stating his dissatisfaction.
And by June 1997, Lazarenko's term in high office was over.
</P>
<P>
   Lazarenko wasted no time seeking revenge. His personal political
party, Hromada, allied with leftists last year to sink Kuchma's
legislative agenda, and his presidential candidacy is rooted in
criticism of the Kuchma government.
</P>
<P>
   Kuchma's response _ mostly swats at pro-Lazarenko newspapers and
anti-Lazarenko reports on state television _ seemed ineffectual.
But since December, Lazarenko has been all but buried under a
landslide of leaked accusations that could only come from Kuchma's
investigators in the state justice ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Ukrainian politicians have made bribery and kickbacks a growth
industry. A Cabinet minister's charge to apply for a cellular-phone
license last year, for instance, was $50,000, with $20,000 kicked
back to the person who passed the bribe for his company, an
American familiar with the details of the case said.
</P>
<P>
   State-owned industries routinely buy raw materials and sell
their output via government-blessed middlemen, a practice tailored
for bribery and price manipulation. Because Kuchma has barred the
government accounting office from auditing budget revenues, the
transactions are mostly exempt from scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   The recently elected speaker of Parliament, also a Kuchma
opponent, was investigated for the mysterious disappearance in 1994
of most of $70 million in U.S. agricultural credits. Prosecution
was impossible; Ukrainian law grants immunity from criminal
prosecution to all elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   The Parliament, which had refused to lift that immunity during
the inquiries, celebrated the speaker's ascendancy last July by
wiping the debt off Ukraine's books.
</P>
<P>
   Among Ukraine's 50 million people, only seven declared an income
of more than $500,000 in 1997. Nobody admitted making more than
$900,000.
</P>
<P>
   In this environment, Lazarenko's arrest is being hailed as an
uncommon masterpiece of gumshoeing by Kuchma's Justice Ministry,
which freely admits giving the Swiss the guts of their case.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Swiss investigators found that during Lazarenko's
term as governor, a Parliament deputy and close political ally,
Mykola Agafonov, struck a very poor deal with a Netherlands
livestock trader. Agafonov gave the livestock trader 64,000 tons of
silicon manganese, worth about $32 million. The trader gave
Agafonov 8,400 head of cattle, worth about $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   But according to a member of the Parliament committee that
investigates corruption, Hryhoriy Omelchenko, the deal did not end
there. On instructions of Agafonov and others, he wrote last month,
at least $12.9 million was shifted from the trader's bank account
to an account in Zurich, Switzerland, that investigators believe
belongs to Lazarenko. The trader has confirmed the cows-for-metal
swap, but says it broke no laws. Lazarenko has said he had nothing
to do with the deal.
</P>
<P>
   If the reports are to be believed, such transactions only
accelerated during Lazarenko's tenure as prime minister. In that
post, Omelchenko contends, Lazarenko ordered the government to buy
prefabricated houses at inflated prices from a Panamanian firm
controlled by a former Lazarenko aide. ``I had nothing to do with
that,'' Lazarenko said in the interview.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss are also reported to be examining Lazarenko's decision
as prime minister to grant one Ukrainian firm, United Energy
Systems, the rights to supply natural gas to one third of Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   The firm is connected to a leading politician in Lazarenko's
party, Julia Timashenko. Reports in The New York Times and
elsewhere, which Lazarenko has denied, have quoted diplomats and
businessmen as saying that the arrangement with United Energy
Systems has netted him $200 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Lazarenko, whose own financial-disclosure reports show that he
has no outside income and owns but one car, a much maligned Russian
Lada, has lately suffered dwindling political fortunes. Ms.
Timashenko, who is called an up-and-coming politician, resigned her
leadership post in the party last month and publicly broke with her
old ally. The drum beat of bad press has taken its toll.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be unwise to count Lazarenko out. For while he
spent less than a year in Kuchma's shadow, he said in the
interview, he learned a great deal about how favors were traded in
exchange for political support of Kuchma's administration.
</P>
<P>
   On March 1, he said, he intends to tell it all to prosecutors:
``How money was collected for election campaigns, how banks and
plants were taxed, and where the money goes,'' he said. ``I know
the bank accounts of these people. ``And I shall name all the names
and accounts of the people supporting the president.''

RODMAN ALREADY IS A DISTRACTION FOR THE LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He has played on five of the last 10 National Basketball
Association champions and has won the league's rebounding title an
unprecedented seven consecutive seasons. On the flip side, he
carouses till dawn, sometimes misses practice and often misses free
throws.
</P>
<P>
   At this tender stage of their championship development, do the
Los Angeles Lakers truly need Dennis Rodman?
</P>
<P>
   While Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant were holding their own
against Indiana Sunday, Rodman, the power forward who could add
considerable intrigue to the Western Conference title chase, was
still mulling whether to sign with the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Without suiting up for one game, Rodman is a distraction for a
team that already has a bundle of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're waiting to hear from him,'' said John Black, a Lakers
spokesman. ``I have no idea where he is or what he's doing. There
is no `latest update' or anything. Once we hear from him, then
maybe we'll have something.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We would love to have Dennis,'' Magic Johnson said on NBC
Sunday night during the Lakers' 101-99 loss to the Pacers. ``But we
would hope that this thing gets solved soon. It's not good for our
team and it's not good for him if it continues go on like this.''
</P>
<P>
   This is vintage Rodman, milking the moment for all its theater
and running the risk that prospective employers will grow weary of
his antics and decide he is not worth the trouble. But the Lakers
have stayed in the hunt, acting desperate at times in spite of all
their talent.
</P>
<P>
   They can offer him only the veterans' minimum of $1 million,
prorated to $600,000 for the lockout-shortened season. A $3 million
endorsement deal from Converse would help foot the bills for those
raucous parties (a bash over Super Bowl weekend in Miami cost
Rodman an estimated $300,000).
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition might set in motion other transactions over the
next month for the Lakers. Eddie Jones and Elden Campbell could be
sent to Charlotte for Glen Rice, B.J. Armstrong and J.R. Reid.
</P>
<P>
   Rice is currently sidelined because of elbow surgery. In the
last year of his contract, he needs to finish strong to warrant a
huge new deal. Becoming the third option on the Lakers would not
help his cause; he would rather return to Miami, where his wife's
family lives.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, the addition of Rodman would not guarantee the
Lakers a reservation for the finals. He can take pressure off
O'Neal inside by guarding other teams' most burly power forwards
and centers. But does a team of impressionable young players who
are still growing up really need an unpredictable teammate added to
the mix?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he realizes the last thing this young team needs is a
distraction,'' said Derek Harper, the 37-year-old veteran point
guard. ``I'm thinking he's going to come in and work the norm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an unnamed source that says he's going to come here and
be normal, if he comes here. I just think he's sick of being a
distraction. I think he wants to come in and do the right thing.
I'm really hoping for that. We have a young team. Any distraction
is going to be a cancer for this team. It's Dennis' responsibility
to stay in line.''
</P>
<P>
   What a concept. Rodman, policing himself at 37. &QL; 
 &QL; 
RISKING THE OLYMPICS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From Charles Barkley's knee to Latrell Sprewell's heel, the
layoff during the lockout has been deemed responsible for a rash of
injuries afflicting the league. The labor dispute has also been
blamed for, among other things, fan apathy and awful execution on
the court.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another less obvious malady that could be the
lockout's greatest casualty: an Olympic gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   As the USA Basketball selection committee prepares over the next
two weeks to pick a team to represent the United States at the Pan
American men's qualifying tournament in Puerto Rico this July, it
will not take the process lightly.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the boycott by NBA players during the world
championships in Athens last July, the United States failed to
qualify then for the 2000 Games in Sydney, Australia. After
finishing third with a hodgepodge unit of college and Continental
Basketball Association players, the men's team now needs to win or
come in second in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine we would get disqualified,'' said Russ Granik,
the N.B.A. deputy commissioner who heads the selection committee.
``But we're still going to pick our best team and take this very
seriously. The key is winning your semifinal game. You can assume
we won't be sending a college team.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those players who boycotted last summer and are expected
to be selected again: Grant Hill, Gary Payton, Allan Houston and
Chris Webber.
</P>
<P>
   And if the United States somehow gets upset? ``We can blame the
labor dispute,'' Granik said. &QL; 
 &QL; 
REALLY SUITING UP &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Charles Oakley, perhaps the league's nattiest dresser, took time
out last week from letting the Knicks know how he felt about being
traded to offer up some fashion tips for NBA youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know guys are into the hip-hop stuff, want to wear
jeans,'' Oakley said. ``That's college and high school. When you
get to a level like this, you got to look good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys are in love with the hip-hop stuff. Every time somebody
has to go to a function, they say, `I don't have nothing to wear.'
I think every guy should have a suit for every day in the week _
even if they have to rotate them or whatever. At this level, you
should have seven suits.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakley also maintained that looking good can help take the sting
away from playing for a team with a lousy record. He wore an
impeccable green tweed ensemble after Toronto's loss to Milwaukee
last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel better, win or lose, once you leave the locker
room,'' he said. ``Hey, you know you gave your best. You have jeans
and stuff, it's a different approach to life. You could be a
millionaire, and you think you don't have to impress anyone with
what you wear. But I always like to look nice.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
K.J. STILL ON THE FENCE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The free agent point guard Kevin Johnson is still deciding
whether to play this season and has yet to commit to the Houston
Rockets, one of several teams interested in his services.

ORDON SHOWS EARNHARDT HIS EXHAUST PIPES AT FINISH  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Jeff Gordon's car roared down the front
straightaway toward the checkered flag in the Daytona 500 Sunday,
his Chevrolet a blur as it swerved from side to side. Dale
Earnhardt was nudging the rear of Gordon's car, looking to make one
of his signature bump-and-run moves.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt's black Monte Carlo peeked to the inside, then to the
outside of Gordon's Monte Carlo, but there was no extra space on
the track. Earnhardt, last year's Daytona 500 winner, quickly was
running out of time when he made one last attempt to pass on the
inside, only to be frustrated again as Gordon steered onto the
apron.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's decisive block _ a risky move at more than 190 miles an
hour _ kept Earnhardt in his rearview mirror as Nascar's biggest
rivals crossed the finish line 1-2 in front of 185,000 screaming
fans at Daytona International Speedway, ending stock car racing's
crown jewel event in dramatic fashion. Kenny Irwin, driving a Ford
Taurus, was a close third and Mike Skinner, in a Chevrolet, was
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Daytona, on the last lap, that black car is not what you
want to see,'' said Gordon, who claimed his second Daytona 500
victory in three years and drove to his seventh victory at this
2.5-mile, high-banked oval. ``Those were the longest 12 laps of my
life here at Daytona. He was setting me up every lap, trying to get
me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's even more special because I beat Dale Earnhardt,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt, 47, the seven-time Winston Cup champion who ended a
19-year drought at this race last year, said: ``If I just could
have got to him on the corner, I might have got under him, but I
just couldn't get him. As we came up there and got to racing the
last 10 laps, it was pretty exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt, who overcame an ignition problem early in the race,
blamed Skinner for not helping him in the draft, a move that may
have enabled both drivers to pass Gordon in the closing laps.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, 27, tied Richard Petty's modern Nascar record of 13
victories last season, when he won his third Winston Cup
championship in four years. Although 33 races remain this season,
Sunday's victory, which paid Gordon the largest single purse in
auto racing ($2,172,446), has the DuPont team rolling toward a
third straight series title and a fourth over all. Gordon's
winnings included the $1 million Winston No Bull 5 bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Wallace, one of the few Winston Cup champions never to
have won the Daytona 500, was leading the race on Lap 188 when
Gordon, who wound up leading for just 17 of the 200 laps, began his
wild charge. Wallace lost the draft of his teammate Jeremy
Mayfield, who had got edged to the back of the lead pack a few laps
before.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace and Mayfield had made it to the front of the field after
a bold gamble with 25 laps left: they stayed out on the track
during a caution flag when Gordon, Earnhardt and the others stopped
to get four fresh tires. But Wallace, who finished eighth, no
longer had any drafting help from Mayfield and soon became prey
when Gordon, Earnhardt, Skinner, Michael Waltrip and Irwin all form
a freight train behind his Taurus.
</P>
<P>
   In the scramble to pass Wallace, Gordon nearly collided with the
mangled machine of Ricky Rudd, who had been lapped, on Lap 188.
Gordon had to jerk his steering wheel at the last second to prevent
a crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made some moves today I didn't really want to make,'' said
Gordon, who started today's race on the pole. ``I came very close
to letting off the gas. I was way down on the apron and I saw Ricky
Rudd going real slow. I thought to myself, `I hope you see me
coming, Ricky.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Big Wreck, that multicar crash that has become something of
a staple at restrictor-plate races, occurred on Lap 136 when Dale
Jarrett, a two-time Daytona 500 winner, spun into the concrete
wall. The crash took out 12 cars, some of which were possible
contenders. Among the drivers involved were Terry Labonte, Ward
Burton and Mark Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very bad about it,'' said Irwin, Jarrett's teammate,
who may have tapped Jarrett's car from behind and triggered the
crash. ``I don't know if I hit him or not. If I could have made it
not happen, I would have made it not happen.'' Irwin's third-place
finish was his best at Daytona.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was the disappointing conclusion to a good week for
Earnhardt, whose 33 victories are more than any other driver. He
won his Gatorade Twin 125 race on Thursday, his 10th straight
victory in the qualifying heats. He also took the checkered flag in
the International Race of Champions on Saturday with a daring,
last-lap pass on Mark Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's race did not go as expected for Joe Gibbs' Pontiacs.
Both of Gibbs' drivers, Bobby Labonte and Tony Stewart, began the
race as favorites, but both were knocked out of contention early
because of electrical problems.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte, the runner-up in last year's Daytona 500, pulled onto
pit lane with a loose spark-plug wire on Lap 51 and dropped one lap
behind. He never recovered, struggling with engine trouble for the
rest of the race. It was a disappointing end for the Interstate
Batteries team because Labonte had driven his Pontiac to victory in
a qualifying race on Thursday and started Sunday's race in fourth
position.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Labonte's teammate, Stewart, also in a Pontiac, limped
down pit lane on Lap 116 with engine problems. Stewart, the Indy
Racing League champion in 1997 who left open-wheel racing for
Nascar this season, shocked everyone by qualifying on the outside
of the front row last week.
</P>
<P>
   After Sunday's race, Earnhardt pulled up alongside Gordon and
bumped him again. This time, the bump was a hardened racer's way of
offering congratulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was saying this car is going into Daytona USA and
I'm going to put my mark on it before it goes,'' Gordon said. ``I
think we both knew it was a great, exciting race.'' &QL;

LOSSES PILING UP FOR MAVERICKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia _ Steve Nash used his hometown as
the backdrop to break out of his shooting slump. But he couldn't
help the Mavericks snap their losing ways.
</P>
<P>
   Nash, who grew up in nearby Victoria, played by far his finest
game as a Maverick, finishing with 18 points and nine assists. But
the Mavericks made an already difficult road trip even more
challenging, losing, 96-92, to the Vancouver Grizzlies before a
crowd of 16,059 yesterday afternoon at General Motors Place.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the hard part of this road trip for the Mavericks, 1-5
after dropping their fourth consecutive game and losing to
Vancouver for just the second time ever.
</P>
<P>
   With the Portland Trail Blazers _ tonight at 9 at the Rose
Garden _ and the Los Angeles Lakers as their next two opponents,
the Mavericks could be looking at some very long faces in the
mirror at the end of this week.
</P>
<P>
   Losing Friday at Denver to start this seven-game, 11-day road
journey, followed by yesterday's dud, did nothing but compound
matters for the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The easy part's over, and we lost,'' center Shawn Bradley said
of the losses to Denver and Vancouver. ``Ouch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was going to be a hard road trip anyway. When you dig
yourself in a hole that deep, it becomes a really, really tough
road trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam Mack and Shareef Abdur-Rahim stuck the daggers in the
Mavericks yesterday. Mack attempted a team-record 13 3-point field
goals and made eight, also a team record.
</P>
<P>
   Abdur-Rahim added 24 points and three blocks as the Grizzlies
improved to 2-3.
</P>
<P>
   Nash made 7-of-11 field-goal attempts, including 4-of-5 from
3-point range. He was aided by Samaki Walker (14 points, 7-of-9
shooting, seven rebounds) and Bradley, who had 10 points, 10
rebounds and four blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Finley was held to nine points for the second time this
season, and was only 4-of-13 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a win more than anything,'' Mavericks coach Don Nelson
said. ``I thought we played well enough to win and followed our
game plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 3-ball beat us tonight, and in some regards that's what we
were giving up, although we wanted to cover Mack better than we
did. We left him open too much.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks were down 86-75 with 8:48 left after Bryant Reeves
hit a 17-foot jumper. But Nash drilled a pair of 3-point field
goals, including one from the left corner that left the Mavericks
trailing only 94-92 with 26.7 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   However, 22 seconds ticked off the clock while the Mavericks
were waiting for Doug West (no free-throw attempts for the season
coming into the game) or Tony Massenburg (13-of-17 on free-throw
attempts coming in) to handle the ball. West eventually got the
ball, was fouled with 4.3 seconds left and buried both free throws
to ice the game.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said he wasn't discouraged by what happened on the court
_ other than the final score.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to get a win,'' he said. ``But we're doing the best
we can.''

GORDON WINS DAYTONA DUEL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ When Jeff Gordon won his first Daytona 500
in 1997, he had it relatively easy. Gordon only had to blow past
two-time Daytona 500 champion Bill Elliott and then hold off
Hendrick Motorsports teammates Terry Labonte and Ricky Craven to
win NASCAR's Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   To win his second Daytona 500 yesterday, Gordon had to
out-hustle Dale Earnhardt _ the defending race champion, master of
the draft and winningest driver at the Daytona International
Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Makes for one memorable Sunday afternoon drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when I got here in '93 and '94, Earnhardt is the
man _ and still is as far as Daytona is concerned,'' Gordon said
after nosing out Earnhardt by 0.128 seconds in the Winston Cup
season-opener. ``Especially at Daytona, in restrictor-plate racing,
Dale is so good. When you have that person in your mirror, he's
definitely got you worried.''
</P>
<P>
   After wresting the lead from Rusty Wallace with a brassy
three-wide pass also involving a charged-up Mike Skinner on lap
190, Gordon and ``The Intimidator'' hooked up for 10 riveting laps
around the 2.5-mile trioval. Still fresh in Gordon's mind was
Earnhardt's 33rd and most recent career victory here Friday.
Earnhardt won the opening round of the International Race of
Champions when he put a classic slingshot pass on Mark Martin along
the bottom of the trioval exiting Turn 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was seeing it in my mirror,'' said Gordon, the three-time
and reigning series champion who scored his 43rd career Cup
victory. ``I watched it the other day. He's the master at that. I
saw it coming and tried to do everything I could to block it.
Luckily, I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt, who made his IROC move while working the draft with
Bobby Labonte, found himself out of helpers and out of horsepower
against Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying all I could to get to the 24,'' said Earnhardt,
referring to Gordon's DuPont Automotive Finishes Chevrolet Monte
Carlo. ``His car was stronger from the center of the corner off
than I was. I just never could get him.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt, who won a record 10th consecutive Twin 125-mile
qualifying race Thursday, never led a lap yesterday in the No. 3 GM
Goodwrench Service Plus Chevy.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we came up there and got to racing in the last 10 laps, it
was pretty exciting,'' said Earnhardt, who had fallen to 20th on
lap 66 because of an ignition-box problem. ``They were bumping and
slamming and bumping and slamming. Anyone who could survive that
last five or 10 laps, it was pretty awesome just to come home and
finish.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace had the day's dominant car, leading the race three times
for a race-high 104 laps in the No. 2 Miller Lite Ford Taurus. But
a questionable pit-strategy call during the race's fourth and final
caution period and Gordon's bold passing move left Wallace 0-for-17
in the Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon and Earnhardt were among the lead-pack drivers who opted
to pit for four fresh Goodyear tires and fuel after Bobby
Hamilton's spin down the backstretch brought out the caution on lap
175. Wallace and Penske-Kranefuss Racing teammate Jeremy Mayfield,
who were running 1-3 before the caution, stayed out on the track
and wound up 1-2 after Earnhardt pitted.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Pemberton, Wallace's crew chief, opted to set up track
position for the teammates, who had only 36 laps on their tires and
were marginal on fuel mileage.
</P>
<P>
   When the race went green on lap 179, Wallace and Mayfield
remained out front through lap 185, when Earnhardt and Gordon
passed Mayfield down the backstretch and moved into second and
third. With help from Skinner, Gordon moved into second on lap 188
and dropped Earnhardt to fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon then set up the pass of the day through the trioval as it
heads into Turn 1. He dived below race-leader Wallace onto the
apron, only to see the lapped and slow-moving car of Ricky Rudd
looming in his path.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping he would see me,'' said Gordon, who led three
times for 17 laps. ``It felt like I was going 1000 miles an hour,
and I was getting ready to check-up \Rlift off the gas\S. Just as I
got to him, he moved a little bit. And my next thought was, how in
the heck do I move Rusty up so I can get off the apron? It opened
up the last few hundred feet. I got up there, but I didn't make the
pass. Dale helped me get past those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   As Gordon, Wallace and Skinner flew in formation down the
backstretch, Earnhardt chose to go with Gordon over best buddy
Wallace and teammate Skinner exiting Turn 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a tough choice there,'' Gordon, 27, said of Earnhardt.
``I thought he would have gone with the other two long before he
would have gone with me. Maybe he wanted to race me to the finish.
I'm glad he went with me, and I'm glad I was able to race him all
the way to the finish.''  &LR; tagtop:John Sturbin, (817) 390-7408

FEDOROV TELLS COACHES TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Backstage at Madison Square Garden on Sunday, there
was a meeting of the stars. Sergei Fedorov, the Detroit Red Wings
center, was chatting with running back Ricky Williams, the Heisman
Trophy winner from Texas, who will probably be one of the top picks
in the National Football League draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing watching you guys skate,'' Williams said to
Fedorov.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like football,'' Fedorov said to Williams.
</P>
<P>
   He also seems to like hockey again. Two weeks ago, Fedorov was
not happy. He was being criticized by fans and his coaching staff,
and he was a puzzle to his teammates. Fedorov said the problem with
his production was ice time. If he were given more time, Fedorov
said, he would play the way he did when he won the Hart trophy as
most valuable player five seasons ago.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Scotty Bowman, who works in mysterious ways, began to give
Fedorov more ice time. Sunday, in a 4-2 victory over the Rangers,
Fedorov played 24 minutes 10 seconds and scored the first goal of
the game and assisted on the last one. His ice time was second
among Detroit forwards to Steve Yzerman, who played 25:11.
</P>
<P>
   In the last four games, all Detroit victories, Fedorov has three
goals and four assists. In Sunday's game, he also won 10 of 16
face-offs, delivered four hits and blocked three shots.
</P>
<P>
   So what did he say to persuade Bowman to use him more?
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't really speak about it,'' Fedorov said. ``I tried to
steer the conversation with him into the ice time. I didn't get a
clear answer. He told me I tried to do too much. I said: `Well,
that's my nature. I used to play a lot. And I'd like to do it
again.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But who knows? Maybe he thought differently. Lately, he's
counted on me a lot more, and I've tried to fulfill his
expectations and make an attempt to bring everybody to the next
level.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Fedorov complained, he was averaging about 17 minutes.
Now, his time is up to 22 to 25 minutes. Fedorov said this was the
first time he had ever made such public demands and that he hoped
his teammates understood. ``I have a spark in me that gets
everybody going,'' Fedorov said.
</P>
<P>
   Fedorov is in the second season of a six-year contract which
will pay him $38 million. His Detroit critics say he plays
inconsistently during the regular season but concede that he peaks
in the playoffs. Last spring, he led Detroit with 10 goals in the
post-season as the Wings won their second consecutive Stanley Cup.
In 56 games this season, Fedorov has 15 goals and 24 assists.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Fedorov's demand, Bowman replied: ``Not
demands. No, he didn't make any demands. It's a long season.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Lewis, one of Bowman's assistants, said Fedorov's demand
was a ``challenge both ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis added: ``When a player asks for more ice time and he gets
it, he has to respond and that's what he did. He puts a lot of
pressure on himself. That's what you want as a coaching staff:
players to put pressure on themselves to perform.''
</P>
<P>
   Yzerman, the captain and veteran center, has moved to Fedorov's
left wing. He had a goal and two assists yesterday and shrugged off
questions about Fedorov's demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody makes a big deal out of it,'' Yzerman said. ``All he
said is he wanted more ice time. Everybody wants more ice time.
It's not that big a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a quiet guy. He doesn't say much. He has played more
lately. We've gone more with three lines. He's gotten more ice
time, and he has the responsibility to play well. And I think he's
played very well since then.'' &QL;

GORDON WINS DAYTONA DUEL
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ When Jeff Gordon won his first Daytona 500
in 1997, he had it relatively easy. Gordon only had to blow past
two-time Daytona 500 champion Bill Elliott and then hold off
Hendrick Motorsports teammates Terry Labonte and Ricky Craven to
win NASCAR's Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   To win his second Daytona 500 yesterday, Gordon had to
out-hustle Dale Earnhardt _ the defending race champion, master of
the draft and winningest driver at the Daytona International
Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Makes for one memorable Sunday afternoon drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when I got here in '93 and '94, Earnhardt is the

LOSSES PILING UP FOR MAVERICKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia _ Steve Nash used his hometown as
the backdrop to break out of his shooting slump. But he couldn't
help the Mavericks snap their losing ways.
</P>
<P>
   Nash, who grew up in nearby Victoria, played by far his finest
game as a Maverick, finishing with 18 points and nine assists. But
the Mavericks made an already difficult road trip even more
challenging, losing, 96-92, to the Vancouver Grizzlies before a
crowd of 16,059 yesterday afternoon at General Motors Place.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the hard part of this road trip for the Mavericks, 1-5
after dropping their fourth consecutive game and losing to
Vancouver for just the second time ever.
</P>
<P>
   With the Portland Trail Blazers _ tonight at 9 at the Rose
Garden _ and the Los Angeles Lakers as their next two opponents,
the Mavericks could be looking at some very long faces in the
mirror at the end of this week.
</P>
<P>
   Losing Friday at Denver to start this seven-game, 11-day road
journey, followed by yesterday's dud, did nothing but compound
matters for the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The easy part's over, and we lost,'' center Shawn Bradley said
of the losses to Denver and Vancouver. ``Ouch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was going to be a hard road trip anyway. When you dig
yourself in a hole that deep, it becomes a really, really tough
road trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam Mack and Shareef Abdur-Rahim stuck the daggers in the
Mavericks yesterday. Mack attempted a team-record 13 3-point field
goals and made eight, also a team record.
</P>
<P>
   Abdur-Rahim added 24 points and three blocks as the Grizzlies
improved to 2-3.
</P>
<P>
   Nash made 7-of-11 field-goal attempts, including 4-of-5 from
3-point range. He was aided by Samaki Walker (14 points, 7-of-9
shooting, seven rebounds) and Bradley, who had 10 points, 10
rebounds and four blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Finley was held to nine points for the second time this
season, and was only 4-of-13 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a win more than anything,'' Mavericks coach Don Nelson
said. ``I thought we played well enough to win and followed our
game plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 3-ball beat us tonight, and in some regards that's what we
were giving up, although we wanted to cover Mack better than we
did. We left him open too much.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks were down 86-75 with 8:48 left after Bryant Reeves
hit a 17-foot jumper. But Nash drilled a pair of 3-point field
goals, including one from the left corner that left the Mavericks
trailing only 94-92 with 26.7 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   However, 22 seconds ticked off the clock while the Mavericks
were waiting for Doug West (no free-throw attempts for the season
coming into the game) or Tony Massenburg (13-of-17 on free-throw
attempts coming in) to handle the ball. West eventually got the
ball, was fouled with 4.3 seconds left and buried both free throws
to ice the game.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said he wasn't discouraged by what happened on the court
_ other than the final score.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to get a win,'' he said. ``But we're doing the best
we can.''

WALLACE, MAYFIELD DEFEND STRATEGY
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Penske-Kranefuss teammates Rusty Wallace
and Jeremy Mayfield swear they lost the Daytona 500 to Jeff Gordon
on the racetrack yesterday, not in the pits.
</P>
<P>
   At least that was the politically correct corporate answer in
the wake of Gordon's race-winning pass of Wallace _ made on four
fresh tires _ in the NASCAR Winston Cup season-opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the tires had anything to do with it,'' said
Wallace, who surrendered the lead to Gordon on lap 190 after a
three-wide drag race that also included Mike Skinner. ``People keep
talking about that, but I thought it was the right move that we
did. I back my crew chief \RRobin Pemberton\S and all the guys for
that call.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace arguably was wheeling the day's dominant car, having led
three times for a race-high 104 laps in the No. 2 Miller Lite Ford
Taurus. Wallace and Mayfield were running 1-3 when Bobby Hamilton's
spin down the Daytona International Speedway backstretch brought
out the race's fourth and final caution on lap 175.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon and Earnhardt were among the lead pack of 14 drivers who
pitted for either two or four fresh tires and fuel. Pemberton and
Paul Andrews, Mayfield's crew chief, opted to set up track position
for the teammates, who had only 36 laps on their tires and were
marginal on fuel mileage.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace and Mayfield were positioned 1-2 after Earnhardt pitted.
When the race went green on lap 179, Wallace and Mayfield remained
out front through lap 185, when Earnhardt and Gordon passed
Mayfield down the backstretch and moved into second and third. With
help from Skinner, Gordon moved into second on lap 188 and dropped
Earnhardt to fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon then set up the pass of the day through the trioval as it
heads into Turn 1. He dived below race-leader Wallace onto the
apron, avoided the slow moving car of Ricky Rudd and raced
alongside Wallace and Skinner down the backstretch and through
turns 3 and 4. Gordon took the lead for good with drafting help
from Earnhardt through the trioval.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, who finished fifth in this race last year, slid back to
an eighth-place result. Mayfield, third here last February, was
relegated to a 20th-place finish after he cut a right front tire on
lap 192 while running seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Track position is everything in these restrictor-plate
races,'' said Mayfield, driver of the No. 12 Mobil 1 Ford. ``The
tires hadn't shown any wear or problems, ours or Rusty's or anybody
else's we knew about. New or old tires, that thing was cut
regardless. We were a lot more worried about fuel than tires.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, meanwhile, found a new way to lose the Daytona 500. The
1989 Cup champion now is 0-for-17 in NASCAR's Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels horrible to lose the Daytona 500 like that after I
thought I had the best car and had a chance to win the thing,''
said Wallace, who allowed that fresh tires might have helped his
car hold onto the bottom of the track a bit better.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the only thing that lost me the race was he \RGordon\S got
a fender underneath me, and I went down to block him off,'' Wallace
said. ``We were gonna wreck like crazy going into \RTurn\S 1 if one
of us didn't give.'' /

OSCAR SHORT ON BIG-NAME TARGETS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Oscar De La Hoya established tremendous momentum
with his courageous victory over Ike Quartey here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   And the plan is to build on it.
</P>
<P>
   He'll face capable but limited Oba Carr on May 22 in Las Vegas
and then, ideally, come back with another major fight in September.
</P>
<P>
   One problem, though: There might not be a major opponent for him
to fight.
</P>
<P>
   The public wants to see De La Hoya-Felix Trinidad in what might
be the most compelling and lucrative fight outside the heavyweight
division.
</P>
<P>
   It's not going to happen, at least not this year.
</P>
<P>
   Those close to the negotiations say that rival promoters Bob
Arum (De La Hoya) and Don King (Trinidad) cannot even begin to come
to terms. Arum admitted as much shortly before the Quartey fight.
</P>
<P>
   So who does that leave for September?
</P>
<P>
   Possibly Pernell Whitaker, who fights Trinidad on Saturday in
New York. The catch is that Whitaker is going to have to beat one
of the most feared fighters in the world or at the very least make
a good showing.
</P>
<P>
   At 35 and after a long layoff, is that asking too much of
Whitaker?
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya's camp certainly hopes not.
</P>
<P>
   Although he once said no one would want to see a rematch of the
boring 1997 De La Hoya-Whitaker fight, won by De La Hoya, Arum now
is praying Sweet Pea somehow finds a way to win for lack of another
compelling opponent.
</P>
<P>
   One realistic possibility is Javier Castillejo, the Spanish
fighter who took Keith Mullings' WBC super welterweight title on
Jan. 29. That's an indication of how desperate Arum and Co. are.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that matchup would have going for it is Mexico
vs. Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican fans would love to see one of theirs _ even an American
version _ pulverize a fighter from the mother country. The fight
moniker ``The Second Revolution'' is already being bandied about.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if that's who he fights and it turns out to be a
pay-per-view broadcast, the buy rate could be dismal.
</P>
<P>
   One solution would be to take a chance on one of the 1996
Olympians: junior middleweights Fernando Vargas or David Reid,
assuming one would take the fight. However, don't expect it to
happen. De La Hoya won't fight a junior middleweight of that
caliber until he grows into the division. Either or both of those
fights won't happen for at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's this intriguing prospect: Rumor is that highly
regarded IBF lightweight champion Shane Mosley is being considered
for either September at a site to be determined or December at the
new Staples Center downtown.
</P>
<P>
   It makes the mouth water just thinking about it: two of the
top-five pound-for-pound fighters in the world, both from the L.A.
area, duking it out in their hometown. Undoubtedly it would be a
huge event.
</P>
<P>
   And the fact Mosley is desperate for a compelling, big-time
fight raises the chances of it happening.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it's just too hard to imagine a fighter, even
a fighter of Mosley's ability, moving up two weight classes to take
on a talent like De La Hoya. Maybe sometime in the future. Not now.
</P>
<P>
   One more possibility: Quartey again.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya probably wants nothing to do with him after
Saturday's war. When asked about a possible rematch, he at first
responded ``I don't think so'' but later said ``I don't know.''
Certainly, it's not something he wants to jump into right away even
though an immediate rematch would generate considerable interest
and money.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Whitaker, if he gives a credible performance, or
Castillejo.
</P>
<P>
   Not all that exciting, is it?
</P>
<P>
   Fight fans should watch HBO's replay of Saturday's fight before
the Whitaker-Trinidad bout. It might be a long time before De La
Hoya's fans experience that kind of exhilaration again.
</P>
<P>
   Questionable tactics: No one is going to question De La Hoya's
courage after his inspiring performance on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   However, it wasn't a work of art.
</P>
<P>
   The champion didn't do the things that could've made it a much
easier fight: jab and move. He connected on only (begin
ital)eight(end ital) jabs per round, according to computer
statistics, and fought flat-footed.
</P>
<P>
   And what made it worse, he wasn't even particularly aggressive
until the final three rounds. He stood around and waited for
something to happen instead of (begin ital)making(end ital) it
happen much of the fight.
</P>
<P>
   He attributed the lack of jabs and movement to a new proclivity
of his: The desire to beat his opponent at his own game. He did it
against Julio Cesar Chavez in his last fight and he did it again
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of aggressiveness was more difficult to explain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I was giving him too much respect,'' he said. ``He did
hit hard. I respected that. But I gave him (begin ital)too(end
ital) much respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``... I thought he was going to put on more pressure. That was
our game plan. This guy has good boxing skills and he switched
things around on us.''
</P>
<P>
   One knowledgeable observer put it this way: De La Hoya fought a
stupid fight for eight rounds and smart one for four _ the last
four.
</P>
<P>
   He's going to have to fight 12 smart rounds consistently if he's
going to realize his potential.
</P>
<P>
   Twelfth round: No one who saw it will ever forget the 12th round
of Saturday's fight. It turned a good fight into a great one.
</P>
<P>
   It started with De La Hoya's brilliant left hook that put
Quartey down and climaxed with a non-stop, hair-raising exchange of
punches in the corner that lasted a good 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya landed a reported 41 punches that round (206 in the
fight), an astonishing (begin ital)17(end ital) in the half-minute
of mayhem. At least 10 were solid blows that Quartey somehow
absorbed without going down.
</P>
<P>
   Referee Mitch Halpern seemed poised to stop the fight at that
moment but didn't because Quartey was throwing back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Oscar was going to kill him,'' Clancy said. ``He hit
Ike with left hooks I don't think anyone I know could take and
throw punches back.''
</P>
<P>
   Said De La Hoya: ``I'm surprised he took the punishment. I
thought I had him out. I give him all the credit in the world. He
took some good punches.''
</P>
<P>
   The scoring: Judge Larry O'Connell of England scored it 115-114
for Quartey, judge John Keane of England 116-113 for De La Hoya and
judge Ken Morita of Japan 116-112 for De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News had it 116-113 for De La Hoya. In an informal
survey, the vast majority of boxing writers had De La Hoya winning
a close fight. &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES: from University of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   His desire to enter law enforcement was born from a wish to make
his community safer. He knew he wanted to be sheriff when he
realized he could be more effective than his bosses.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this stage of my life, I have fewer years to live than
before. I'm tired of waiting for solutions to matters like the gang
problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In just seven weeks, Baca has already completed more than 70
inspections and identified problems. Stations need new fax machines
and printers. Others need software upgrades or computer training.
And others need more tools to fight the gang problem.
</P>
<P>
   Many of his meetings with commanders and deputies take place in
restaurants and coffeehouses. So much so that he hopes the
department can afford to buy him a sport-utility vehicle that will
double as an office, complete with fax, phone and computer
connections.
</P>
<P>
   It makes days hard on Sgt. Pat Maxwell, Baca's driver, who
applauds the sheriff's energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he works 16-hour days, so do I,'' Maxwell said. ``But I
can tell you what he's doing has made morale really jump around
here.''
</P>
<P>
   During the two to three hours a day he's in his office, it's all
about business. He keeps his phone conversations short because,
``if they can't get to the point in 15 minutes, it's personal and
wastes time,'' he said. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; During Block's reign, the sheriff's headquarters meeting room
contained a series of portraits of former chiefs and high-ranking
department officials.
</P>
<P>
   Baca had them moved to a hallway.
</P>
<P>
   In their place is a series of notes, scrawled in big block
letters, that list departmental issues. The notes will soon be
replaced with wall-mounted easels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those pictures had nothing to do with our mission, and there
was no point for them being here. I want this room to be entirely
about our business, and that's what it now is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Friday, the sheriff met with 41 city managers and
county officials to discuss law enforcement and the county's risk
of lawsuits. The meeting was groundbreaking in that it was the
first time the sheriff, county counsel and the county
administrative officer had met together with this group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sheriff has always been involved, but for years the county
counsel would not meet in this kind of forum,'' said County
Administrative Officer David Janssen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think part of the reason this finally happened is because
Baca has great enthusiasm about his challenges and is thoughtful
about issues. And he's very open about what he's doing, like the
fact he's asking the county for a $100 million budget
enhancement.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; By 2 p.m., Baca heads for a live spot on a popular cable
television talk show with some of the department's harshest
critics.
</P>
<P>
   He's still wearing his black suit. His embroidered shirt cuffs
read ``LDB.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have worn my uniform for this, darn it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Century Communications studio, Baca meets Connie Rice,
among other guests.
</P>
<P>
   Walking out of the makeup room, Baca reaches the set, where he's
hit with questions about everything from his use-of-force policy to
police chases to problems in county jails.
</P>
<P>
   Rice quizzes him about what he'll do to understand and repair
his scandal-plagued jails.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I have taken on `Mission: Impossible' with the jail
system,'' he said, responding to Rice's question. ``But I'm going
to be in the jails walking the line with the guards, and changes
will be made.''
</P>
<P>
   He walks out of the studio and meets up with Deputy Bill Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``So how did I do?'' Baca asked in a rare moment of uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``You did great,'' a grinning Martin replied, patting his boss
on the shoulder. ``Man, you did great.''
</P>
<P>
   Century Communications General Manager William Rosendahl, who
hosts the company's popular ``Week In Review,'' said this was not
Baca's first appearance on the show: He would often show up at
round-tables when Block couldn't make it.
</P>
<P>
   Rosendahl is impressed by his ability to ``let go of the
negativity'' stirred up during the campaign, and his efforts to
open communication with the Board of Supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he learned through the political process what he was
made of,'' Rosendahl said.
</P>
<P>
   Baca said he surely knows what he's made of. So much so that he
knows when it will be time to retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll quit when I'm no longer able to meet needs assessments.
When my vision is no longer in focus. When I slow down.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will be the time.''

LOS ANGELES COUNTY'S NEW SHERIFF EMBARKS ON SWEEPING CAMPAIGN OF
CHANGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PHILLIP W. BROWNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Los Angeles County's new sheriff, Lee Baca,
marched toward his new office and gestured at the double doors.
They were propped open.
</P>
<P>
   He greeted his secretary with a wave and entered the inner
office, which his predecessor Sherman Block occupied for 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   That door was open, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Block was concerned about security in here, so he kept these
closed. I ordered them open at all times,'' Baca said, cracking a
smile that broke just for a moment his all-business, all-the-time
demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not as concerned,'' he said. ``Someone might try to come
and shoot me, but I'll be wearing a uniform and a gun -- and I'll
probably shoot them first.''
</P>
<P>
   Pure Baca.
</P>
<P>
   In eight weeks since Baca took the office he won from Block in a
hard-fought election, he has moved quickly to rebuild the
department in his image. The first elected sheriff since 1914, Baca
already is knee-deep in dramatic management changes that include
pruning the top command structure and redistributing the $1.4
billion budget.
</P>
<P>
   He is pushing for a $100 million budget increase from the Board
of Supervisors to hire more deputies and purchase equipment.
</P>
<P>
   He wants badly an inspector general position to look into the
recent rash of deaths among inmates and suspects in deputies'
custody.
</P>
<P>
   He is creating a Deputy Leadership Institute, which would train
everyone in the department to conduct themselves fairly and
responsibly, including dealing with racism, sexism and homophobia.
Ordering that his office doors remain open was a first, easy and
profoundly symbolic fix, he said.
</P>
<P>
   To Baca, the message is priceless: He's no Sherman Block.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under Block there was a feeling that managers were unconnected
to line people and that they couldn't trust each other,'' Baca
said. ``That's why I'm flattening the bureaucracy and creating
leadership training for deputies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm also trying to wipe out the feeling that being a deputy
sheriff is just a societal role. The sheriff and his deputies are
one and the same -- all leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Those messages have quickly filtered down to deputies like
Michael Irving, who worked under Block for most of his 10 years as
a deputy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made a huge effort to let everyone know he's here for the
deputies,'' Irving said. ``With his doors open, there's an open
line of communication; and he's frequently in uniform so it brings
him to our level. You didn't have that with Block. Morale has very
much been boosted.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been a tough challenge, however. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; During the campaign, Block won endorsements from the
Association for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs, representing deputies
and District Attorney's Office investigators, and the Los Angeles
County Professional Police Officers Association, which represents
sergeants, lieutenants and other sworn and nonsworn personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Block also won unanimous support from the Board of Supervisors,
who believed his experience, longevity and history of
accomplishment outweighed the need for new blood.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the sheriff died, his campaign continued and he won
support from heavyweights like Supervisor Mike Antonovich.
</P>
<P>
   Since then Baca has won high marks from Antonovich.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were at a community meeting last week together, and
things are off to a good start,'' said Lori Howard, Antonovich's
assistant chief deputy. ``He's excited that Sheriff Baca wants to
bring a substation to Altadena, and he loves the idea to add 1,000
deputies to the department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Antonovich will vote in support of Baca's $100 million
request,'' Howard said.
</P>
<P>
   One of Baca's opponents in the campaign, Bill Baker, said he
remains skeptical about Baca's ability to follow through on
promises, an issue he raised during the race. He predicted during
the campaign that Baca's policies would be a ``perpetuation of
Block's policies with no meaningful reform.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been two months in office and it's too early to criticize
him, but he's done a couple of things that are questionable to
me,'' Baker said. ``He has been slamming his shoe on the desk with
the Board of Supervisors for that increased funding, and I think
he's making promises to the rank-and-file that he can't keep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always liked Lee, and I don't think he's a bad person. I
think he's a little naive.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles attorney Connie Rice, a former director of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People who
started her own law firm, hopes Baca can take on ``Mission:
Impossible'' in fixing the county jail system, which has been
plagued by allegations of fatal inmate beatings, mistreatment of
mentally ill prisoners and overdetention in recent years. Based on
her experiences with Baca, she said she has much hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's highly intelligent, sensible and solves problems. He's
not ideological,'' Rice said. ``He's the kind of leader that steps
into other people's shoes. He understands the challenge of law
enforcement in a complicated society, and he does not wage war on
those he feels are out to get him.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; For the first time in many years, the sheriff is a sheriff in
motion.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Block, Baca spends most of his 16-hour days on the road,
visiting scores of the department's stations and jail facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not lost in the bureaucracy. I'm the most visible sheriff
to people doing the job,'' Baca said. ``I had one deputy tell me he
only saw Sherman Block once, and he's seen me four times in seven
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Hired as a sheriff's deputy to patrol East Los Angeles in 1965,
the 56-year-old Baca rose through the ranks and in 1981 was
appointed captain by then-Sheriff Peter Pitchess. A short time
later he was elevated to the rank of commander, and in 1992 Block
promoted him to chief. A year later, he earned a doctorate in
public administration from University of Southern California.

ATLER IS STAR OF TRIALS 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVEN CHAVEZ  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   POMONA _ Vanessa Atler is no stranger to top-notch gymnastics
competitions. In front of an enthusiastic, partisan crowd at Cal
Poly Pomona, Atler turned the competition into her own personal
showcase at the Pan American Games Trials on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-year-old captured first place in three of the four
apparatus en route to an all-around championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of her best performances,'' said Charter Oak Gliders
gymnastics coach Steve Rybacki, who trains Atler. ``It's another
step to where we want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Atler, a Canyon Country resident, leads a team of six gymnasts
who qualified to represent the U.S. at the Pan American Games,
which will take place this July and August in Winnipeg, Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Ranked No.2 in the nation, Atler stood out from the group of 33
young women from the onset of the competition. She was just the
second gymnast on the floor exercise but left a lasting impression.
With tango music setting the beat, Atler scored a 9.85, good enough
to last the entire competition and to win the gold.
</P>
<P>
   Atler followed with a 9.887 on the vault to win the gold, then
won silver with a 9.725 on the uneven bars, trailing Sierra Sapunar
of Cincinnati, who scored a 9.750.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always had trouble in the (uneven) bars,'' said Atler.
``But each thing is getting better and hopefully by the time I get
to Worlds (championships), (the trouble) will all be gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Atler finished the competition with a 9.825 on the balance beam
to win her third apparatus gold and secure the all-around title
with an overall score of 39.287.
</P>
<P>
   Jennie Thompson and Alyssa Beckerman of Cincinnati, who finished
second and third, respectively, and sixth-place finisher Erinn
Dooley of Gaithersburg, Md. will also compete with the U.S. Pan
American team.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the opportunity to represent the U.S., Atler is
uncertain whether she will compete in the Pan American Games or
other summer tournaments in which she might face tougher
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pan-Am is a maybe still, it's still an iffy thing,'' said
Atler. ``I'll just keep training the same and get ready for the big
events.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Dantzscher of San Dimas finished fifth in the all-around
to secure a spot on the team. Jeanette Antolin of Huntington Beach
and Diamond Bar finished fourth.

NOT A MOMENT TOO SOON, BASEBALL IS ALMOST HERE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ In one of my favorite movies, ``Beautiful
Girls'' (circa 1996), the character played by Uma Thurman, Andera,
is talking to Willie, played with rapt fascination by Timothy
Hutton.
</P>
<P>
   As if to show that she is the coolest, foxiest, hippest female
that Willie and his New England n'er-do-wells have ever set eyes
upon, Thurman impresses Hutton by knowing exactly how many days are
left before pitchers and catchers have to report to spring
training.
</P>
<P>
   Cool.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't get the girl. But I was impressed.
</P>
<P>
   It goes to show, too, that the phrase `` `x' days until pitchers
and catchers have to report,'' has become a staple of the American
winter lexicon. And well it should.
</P>
<P>
   Seasons change. The groundhog does his thing. The President's
Day linen sales come and go.
</P>
<P>
   But if you really want to set your watches, find the date that
pitchers and catchers have to report.
</P>
<P>
   Three days, guys. Three days.
</P>
<P>
   Cool.
</P>
<P>
   Where do we begin to muse about what the next eight months of
baseball have in store?
</P>
<P>
   Do the Rangers have what it takes to be an annual playoff
fixture? Can Mark McGwire juice up a little more and go for 71?
</P>
<P>
   The answers start coming Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there we were. In the jungle just outside Chu Lai. We
had a platoon of VC firing at us from the village just one click up
the road. I was calling in air strikes, when ...
</P>
<P>
   Oops. Sorry. I guess I was having a Tim Johnson Vietnam
flashback.
</P>
<P>
   But isn't that strange? The two tallest tales to be explored and
flogged to death this spring are certain to be Toronto manager
Johnson's bogus tour of Vietnam duty and Yankee pitcher Orlando
Hernandez's questioned dash for freedom through shark-infested
waters.
</P>
<P>
   Strange, because a year ago, if someone had suggested that one
major-leaguer would hit 70 home runs and another 66, that would
have sounded like a tall tale, too.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Bud Selig called it baseball's ``greatest year,''
and it's hard to argue. An average of 29,000 per game, third
highest in baseball history, walked through the turnstiles. Only a
clunker of a World Series _ the Yankees' sweep of the San Diego
Padres _ soiled baseball's party.
</P>
<P>
   What could the sport possibly do for an encore?
</P>
<P>
   Well, there's Albert Belle. Universally loved, like a bad virus,
Belle takes his act into a true hitter's park in Baltimore. It
bears noting that after the All-Star break last year, McGwire hit
33 home runs; Belle hit 31.
</P>
<P>
   Belle's dual assault _ on McGwire's record and on new teammate
Will Clark's thin patience _ will be worth following, as will all
the Orioles. Baltimore was the only team in baseball last year with
a payroll over $48 million that finished below .500.
</P>
<P>
   So what did owner Peter Angelos do? He spent $120 million on
free agents.
</P>
<P>
   In baseball, alas, that was the unspoken charm of the
McGwire-Sammy Sosa home run chase, that the only people who were
dwelling on the money were the fans hawking the home-run balls.
Fans clearly are weary of hearing that Kevin Brown, he of few
smiles, has signed a contract that calls for $100 million and more
perks than Juan Antonio Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   Don't show me the money. I'm tired of the money.
</P>
<P>
   I'm tired of reading how the Anaheim Angels paid to sign a rag
arm like Tim Belcher, insist Ken Hill will be a solid No. 2, and
still don't know who their everyday catcher will be, yet still
think they have leapfrogged into the favorite's role in the
American League West.
</P>
<P>
   I'm tired of reading about Jerry Colangelo, who spent $119
million in the off-season stocking the Arizona Diamondbacks with
free agents. His lineup figures to include overhyped, overpaid
Steve Finley, Bernard Gilkey, Luis Gonzalez and Jay Bell.
Regardless of how much pitching Colangelo paid for, this is still
Operation Desert Mirage.

<P>
   I'm also tired of reading about Garth Brooks. If Uma Thurman
tries out for the Padres, though, call me.
</P>
<P>
   I'm tired of reading about the Expos' payroll. I'm tired of
reading about the Dodgers spending $90 million. I'm tired of
reading the phrases ``big market'' and ``small market.''
</P>
<P>
   All I want to read this week is how the pitchers and catchers
are doing. They report this week, you know, guys.
</P>
<P>
   Cool.

USC WRAPS UP BANNER WEEKEND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS COCOLES  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It looks like the raising of USC's 12th national
championship banner at Dedeaux Field is inspiring the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   At least that what coach Mike Gillespie hopes following the
Trojans' second straight win, a dramatic 5-4 decision over visiting
Texas Tech on Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Munson's solo home run with two outs in the bottom of the
ninth followed up a 5-3 win on Saturday, when USC's 1998 College
World Series championship team was honored.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be (a boost),'' Gillespie said of the hoopla
surrounding Saturday's pregame ceremonies, which included the USC
band and several departed players from last season, when the school
won its first national title since 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great to get some of those guys back here who are no
longer with us,'' Gillespie said.
</P>
<P>
   Ranked fourth and ninth by Collegiate Baseball and Baseball
America, respectively, USC (3-5) bounced back with two consecutive
wins over a quality opponent after losing five in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have the band here and all the other guys coming back was
exciting for the younger guys on the team,'' said Munson, the
junior All-American catcher who homered twice Sunday _ a three-run
shot in the fifth off preseason All-American Shane Wright and the
game-deciding solo blast in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   The No.13 Red Raiders rallied from 4-0 down to tie the Trojans
entering the ninth and reliever Brandon Roberson (1-1) was
dominant, retiring the first five hitters he faced after taking the
mound in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Munson got ahead of Roberson 2-1 in the count, taking a ball
that was questioned by the Texas Tech battery and dugout. Munson
then belted a changeup over the wall in right-center for his fifth
homer of the season and fourth in the three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 1-1 pitch was a little down and out and it was much more
of a pitcher's pitch,'' Munson said. ``The next one was down and in
and a much better pitch to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   About the only downer for USC was the no-decision for starting
pitcher Justin Lehr, the senior transfer from UC Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   Making just his fifth career start, Lehr took a no-hitter into
the seventh inning. He lost it on a bloop single by Jon Weber, then
yielded a double and Allen Marshall's three-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander was charged with the tying run in the eighth
but his line still included nine strikeouts against just two walks
in 72/3 innings. Steve Smyth (1-1) earned the win with 11/3
scoreless innings in relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt good. I was able to get ahead in the count and mix my
pitches pretty well. I didn't do that as well the other night,''
said Lehr, referring to the loss he suffered in relief of the
series opener Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Lehr batted for himself and went 3 for 4 with a double. Carlos
Casillas also homered for the Trojans. &QL;

HORRY HOSPITALIZED WITH CHEST PAINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Lakers forward Rick Fox's locker is adjacent to
Robert Horry's dressing cubicle, and Fox said the moment Horry
arrived at the Forum on Sunday he knew something was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Call it intuition or a good memory, but a little while later
Horry was complaining of chest pains and taken to Centinela
Hospital Medical Center. Medical tests disclosed Horry had an
irregular heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Horry was scheduled to remain in the hospital overnight and is
expected to undergo additional tests this morning.
</P>
<P>
   It caused Fox think back to his days with the Boston Celtics,
and to Reggie Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis died of a heart problem while working out in a gym.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know if it was heartburn, or what is was (with
Horry),'' Fox said. ``I know he just came off a virus and he was
sick. He had a cold and an upper respiratory infection. Sometimes
that can do it, but I'm not a doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-10 Horry was in coach Del Harris' starting lineup
before his complaints sent him to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a shock to find out we didn't have Robert,'' Harris
said. ``I didn't know we weren't going to have him until our
players went out on the court. We're hoping the best for him.
That's the important thing right now.''
