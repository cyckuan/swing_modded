<HEADLINE> Round-Up: FTAA Needs New Push </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, Chile, April 17 (Xinhua) -- After four years of the
kick-off, The Second Summit of the Americas scheduled to open here
tomorrow will give a new push for the slow process of the Free
Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA).
</P>
<P>
Initiated by U.S. President Bill Clinton, 34 leaders of the
West Hemisphere gathered in Miami in December 1994 to conceive a
blueprint for the establishment of a free trade zone by 2005. The
FTAA could become the World's largest tariff-free area with a
combined population of 750 million and gross domestic product
exceeding 9 trillion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally regarded as the "backyard" of the United States,
the region now accounts for some 38.6 percent of all U.S. exports,
with Latin American shipments expected to surpass those to Western
Europe and Japan combined by the year of 2010. The Clinton
administration attaches great importance to the FTAA
establishment.
</P>
<P>
At the 1994 summit, the 34 leaders agreed to a plan of action
that included 23 initiatives covered in four baskets: Preserving
and Strengthening of Democracy; Promoting Prosperity Through
Economic Integration and Free Trade; Eradicating Poverty and
Discrimation; and Guaranteeing Sustainable Development and
Conserving Our Natural Environment for Future Generations.
</P>
<P>
Since the Miami Summit, 12 working groups have been organized
to study and work out common positions on major issues linked to
trade and investment, assisted by a tripartite commission from the
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the UN Economic Commission
for latin America and the Caribbean and the Organization of
American States (OAS).
</P>
<P>
In the last less than four years, relevant ministerial meetings
of foreign affairs, trade, treasury, energy, defense, justice,
transportation and education have been convened. Under the Trade
Committee, there are working groups which undertook discussions on
some major topics such as market access, agriculture and financial
services.
</P>
<P>
The Santiago Summit will be focused on Education issues which
form a basket itself-- Education: Investing in People' Defining
Our Shared Future. Other topics of the meeting include Making
Democracy Relevant, Enjoying the Fruits of Freedom, Building Our
Wealth Through Economic Integration and Trade, Rejecting Poverty
Amid Growing Prosperity, which form other three baskets.
</P>
<P>
The Second Summit of the Americas is to evaluate progress
achieved since Miami and synthesize the concrete actions that
governments must take to further open their markets to private
investment and to deepen democratic reforms.
</P>
<P>
The 34-nation trade ministers held another meeting in San Jose,
Costa Rica a month ago. The participants concluded a frame
agreement over principles and goals of the proposed trade
negotiations. Once the Santiago Summit gives green light to the
ministerial agreement, the official negotiations would kick off as
early as May. The Santiago Summit could an important milestone for
the development of the FTAA.
</P>
<P>
For realization of the FTAA, the Americas prevail some
favorable conditions: first, in recent years, there have formed
stable political, economic and social environment throughout the
hemisphere which is attributable largely to political and economic
reforms.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, in the wake of the Uruguay Round of trade talks, the
Latin American and Caribbean nations gradually gave up the
close-door policies and government intervention, turning to
market-oriented economic policies. At present all 34 Americas
except Bahamas are members of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
And thirdly, there have been active agenda of free trade area
negotiations in the hemisphere. Apart from the three-nation North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the four-nation MERCOSUR
in Southern America, we have witnessed in the past year the
conclusion of the Chile-Canada Free Trade Area (FTA), the
MERCOSUR-Chile FTA, and the MERCOSUR-Bolivia FTA, as well as the
initiation of negotiation between MERCOSUR and the Andean Pact,
between Panama and Chile, between Mexico and Northern Triangle of
Central America and between Central America and the islands of the
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
However, in order to fulfil the 34 nation leaders' mandate for
"concrete progress by the end of the century", there still exist a
number of obstacles and difficulties. The FTAA was initiated by
the United States. But, since the Clinton administration failed to
admit Chile into the NAFTA as it pledged and lost its battle for
foreign trade "fast track" authorization in 1997, the U.S.
government is much less convincing for advocating for free trade
in the hemisphere and official negotiations could be delayed until
2000 or after.
</P>
<P>
Besides, there have been disagreement over the FTAA negotiation
pace between the U.S. and Brazil. The former advocates for
accelerating agenda and the later holds for "gradualism" for
consolidation of the MERCOSUR first and then move to FTAA
negotiations. The United States targets the free trade area as a
large market of 750 million population for its exports. But the
Latin American and Caribbean countries are more concerned for
their social and economic development. The FTAA negotiations would
involve some interest-conflicted groups such as organizations of
labor, environmentalists and consumers as well as some other
non-governmental groups. Each inch of progress in the future
negotiations would be fought seriously and furiously.
</P>
<P>
Although there has been not a bad start, there is still a long
way to go to reach the FTAA and the process obviously needs new
push.

<HEADLINE> Li Ruihuan Stresses Role of Non-Public Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, said today that various economic sectors should be
encouraged and developed to ease employment pressure.
</P>
<P>
While making an inspection in Wenzhou, booming city in east
China's Zhejiang Province, Li, a member of the Standing Committee
of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Party of China Central
Committee, praised local officials and the masses for exploring a
proper path of building socialism with Chinese characteristics
over the past years.
</P>
<P>
Wenzhou has a total population of seven million, however, it
has worked hard to provide jobs to one million local people who
used to be engaged in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the city has attracted one million workers from
other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The achievements should be attributed to the booming of
non-public businesses, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan noted the non-public ownership constitutes an
important component of China's socialist market economy. To make
public ownership as the mainstream and let diversified ownership
develop is the basic economic system in the primary stage of
socialism, he said.

<HEADLINE> Blair Arrives in Cairo on Mideast Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 17 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
arrived here Friday afternoon on a two-day visit to Egypt as part
of his multi-leg maiden tour of the Middle East aimed at giving a
shot to the stalled Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Blair, accompanied by a team of diplomats specialized in Middle
East affairs and a number of journalists, was greeted at the
airport by Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak will give a banquet in honor
of the British prime minister Friday evening. Their talks will
focus on the European role in helping break a year-long stalemate
in the Mideast peace process. Britain is currently holding the
rotating presidency of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have been bogged down for
13-month over the Israeli construction of a Jewish settlement in
Arab East Jerusalem and over the scope and time scale of an
overdue Israeli pullback from the West Bank. Negotiations on the
Syrian and Lebanese tracks have been on ice since February 1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ways of fostering Anglo-Egyptian economic relations
will figure high during Blair's talks with the Egyptian leader.
Britain is Egypt's second largest non-Arab investor after the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Blair, on his debut trip to the region since taking office last
year, will explore prospects for stronger ties with Egypt during
meetings with Ganzouri and Foreign Minister Amr Moussa Saturday.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, he is also scheduled to meet with members of the
British-Egyptian businessmen Association to examine the
possibility of increasing joint investments.
</P>
<P>
During his Cairo trip, Blair will meet with Grand Sheikh of
Al-Azhar Mohamed Sayed Tantawi, Egypt's top religious scholar,
before leaving for Saudi Arabia, the second leg in his Mideast
tour which will also take him to Jordan, Israel and the
Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
The tour comes at a time when Europe is urged to play a more
active role in the stalemated Mideast peace process, especially
since the U.S.-dominated mediation efforts have so far failed to
unlock the peace logjam. U.S. Mideast peace envoy Dennis Ross will
begin a new round of shuttle diplomacy in the region in the coming
days.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who toured the region
last month, was snubbed in Israel allegedly for breaching an
understanding on the arrangements of his visit to the Har Homa in
East Jerusalem. Israel's Jewish settlement construction work at
the site is behind the long freeze in Palestinian-Israeli talks.
</P>
<P>
Britain has made it clear that the status of Jerusalem, the
thorniest issue in the Palestinian-Israeli track, should be
decided at the final stage of their negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Israel has repeatedly rejected European involvement in the
peace process, favoring an absolute mediating role for the
United States.

<HEADLINE> WHO Confident of Control River Blindness by 2002 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) has announced that a program to control the disease, river
blindness, in West Africa will end in 2002 due to its success over
the last 25 years.
</P>
<P>
The Onchocerciasis Control Program, which cost half a billion
U.S. dollars, will protect over 40 million people from the disease
and about 600,000 from blindness, WHO said.
</P>
<P>
The disease, called onchocerciasis or river blindness, is
transmitted by the bite of the black flies which release into the
human bodies tiny worms (microfilaria). These tiny worms cause
unbearable itching, skin disfigurement and blindness.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the program sponsored by the World Bank, the United
Nations Development Program, the U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organization and WHO, gone are the days when up to 50 percent of
the adult population over 30 percent in rural areas of West Africa
suffered from the disease.
</P>
<P>
Further surveillance to detect reinfection and rapid protection
of the concerned population by treatment with ivermectin is
required and must be maintained for the foreseeable future, WHO
added.
</P>
<P>
WHO also wants to integrate the surveillance into a
multi-disease surveillance system primarily oriented towards
epidemic-prone diseases such as cholera, meningitis, yellow fever
and malaria after the Onchocerciasis Control Program terminates in
2002.

CAIRO, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed
Saeed Al-Sahhaf arrived here Friday for talks with President Hosni
Mubarak and Arab League Secretary General Esmat Abdel-Meguid, the
Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency (INA) said al-Sahhaf will be acting as
President Saddam Hussein's special envoy while meeting with
Mubarak. No details of his mission were available.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf told reporters that he would deliver a letter from
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to Mubarak, but he did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister will then travel on to New York where he
will watch closely the half-yearly review within the U.N. Security
Council of a report submitted by the U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM) overseeing the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
The seven-year-old crippling U.N. sanctions against Iraq can
only be lifted after the UNSCOM certifies that Baghdad has scrapped
all prohibited weapons.
</P>
<P>
According to the INA, al-Sahhaf will meet representatives of
some members of the Security Council to discuss the latest
development in Iraq's relationship with the United Nations.

<HEADLINE> Kiriyenko Expresses Concerns on Economic Drop in Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian Acting Prime Minister
Sergei Kiriyenko has warned of a possible drop of the country's
economic growth rate due to unstable political situation.
</P>
<P>
After the State Duma's (the lower house of parliament) second
refusal to approve his nomination as prime minister on Friday,
Kiriyenko said that the unstable political situation would affect
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The sooner the government crisis was over, the better it would
be for the Russian economy, Kiriyenko said.
</P>
<P>
There were different estimations of economic growth rates in
the first quarter of this year, he said, but the situation was
generally worse than it was in the fourth quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
The acting premier also expressed his concern on the
possibility to dissolve the State Duma.
</P>
<P>
The president has the constitutional right to dissolve the Duma
if it rejects his candidates for the premiership three times, he
said.
</P>
<P>
But the refused nominee said he was not interested in
"political games" and would not be involved in any bargaining.

<HEADLINE> India Urged to Continue Trade Reforms to Maintain Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The World Trade Organization (WTO)
has urged India to continue liberalizing its trade and investment
structures to ensure strong and stable economic growth.
</P>
<P>
After a two-day meeting, the WTO released a report on India's
trade policies and practices.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that India's economic growth slowed in
1997 after its reforms and trade liberalization policies led to a
dramatic increase in the mid-1990's.
</P>
<P>
Due to large flows of foreign investment and increased
international trade, India had achieved annual average growth
rates of 7 percent from 1993 to 1996, the report said.
</P>
<P>
India had recognized the need to continue economic reform, with
an increased emphasis on improving its industrial infrastructure,
which had proved to be a constraint on expanding economic activity
and stimulating exports.
</P>
<P>
Other measures under consideration were reductions in tariffs
and non-tariff measures, reforming the subsidies structure --
estimated to account for 14 percent of the GDP -- and
restructuring public sector enterprises.
</P>
<P>
India's tariffs had been reduced from an average of 71 percent
in 1993 to 35 percent now. However, the tariff structure remained
complex and escalation remained high in several industries,
notably paper and paper products, printing and publishing, wood
and wood products, and food, beverages and tobacco.
</P>
<P>
In general, the report said, bound tariffs remained
substantially higher than applied rates, especially on
agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
Import licensing remained India's main non-tariff barrier, the
report noted, although reforms to the system of restrictive import
licensing had moved ahead steadily.
</P>
<P>
The number of goods subject to import licensing had been
gradually reduced, with an emphasis on industrial and capital
goods, rather than consumer products.
</P>
<P>
The WTO report was not satisfied with the fact that India had
refrained from reforms on export subsidies and incentives and had
continued to maintain a large number of incentive programs for
exports.
</P>
<P>
It said that the overall scope of income tax exemptions,
subsidized credit, export insurances and guarantees has been
enhanced, resulting in more explicit export-oriented policies.

PARIS, April 17 (Xinhua) -- French police on Friday arrested an

<HEADLINE> 4 Israeli Soldiers, 1 Lebanese Wounded in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Four Israeli soldiers and one
Lebanese civilian were wounded Friday during Lebanese guerrilla
attacks in south Lebanon, Lebanese Voice of the People radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
The four Israelis were injured when their Shigif stronghold
inside the so-called Israeli security zone in south Lebanon was
hit by guerrilla rockets, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Shiite Muslim "Amal" Movement led by the country's
House Speaker Nabih Berry claimed responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
The attack raised to 43 the number of Israeli soldiers wounded
in south Lebanon since the beginning of this year. Another four
had been killed.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Israeli allied South Lebanese Army said a
Lebanese civilian was also wounded by a mortar shell that was fired
toward an Israeli outpost at the village of Kaokab inside the zone.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of
God, carried out attacks on the Israeli position at Barashit
inside the occupied zone, the radio said. No casualties were
reported.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation for the attack, Israeli artillery later shelled
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Since Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer self-declared
security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 with the aim of protecting
its northern settlements from Lebanese guerrilla cross-border
attacks, clashes between the Israeli troops and Lebanese
resistance fighters have never stopped.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Imperial of Bank of
Commerce (CIBC) and Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) announced their
merger Friday, which would be worth 45.8 billion Canadian dollars
(31.9 billion U. S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The deal comes close on the heels of the January announcement
of the biggest corporate marriage between the nation's biggest and
third biggest banks, the Royal and the Bank of Montreal.
</P>
<P>
Both deals are now waiting for blessing from the federal
government, which is apparently not happy with the mergermania in
the banking sector.
</P>
<P>
The merged bank, which would be called CIBC, will have a
combined assets of 460 billion Canadian dollars (322 billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Once merged, it will become the second largest bank in Canada
and the 10th largest in North America in terms of market
capitalization, which was 45.8 billion Canadian dollars (40.9
billion U.S. dollars) at the close of trading on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The combined company will have more than 10 million customers
in Canada and around the globe, with more than 74,000 full-time
equivalent employees," CIBC and TD said in a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
"This agreement will create a strong, competitive bank that is
Canadian-based," said Al Flood, CIBC chairman and chief executive
officer.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that this deal will make us better able to compete,
not only with domestic competitors but also with powerful
competitors from all over the world," added Charles Baillie,
Flood's TD counterpart.
</P>
<P>
But Canadian Finance Minister Paul Martin was not so sure about
all the benefits mergers will bring along.
</P>
<P>
"The No. 1 concern of the government remains what is good for
Canadians and the Canadian economy," Martin said Friday shortly
after the announcement.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the government will not consider such deals
until a full review of the industry is complete, perhaps by the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, bank merger frenzy has been sweeping the North
American continent. Friday's proposed merger was the third
multi-billion dollars bank merger announced this week alone.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, NationsBank Corp. and BankAmerica Corp. revealed a
plan to create the biggest bank in the United States, with assets

<HEADLINE> China-ASEAN Senior Officials Consultation Held in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The two-day fourth
China-ASEAN Senior Officials Consultation ended Friday and the
meeting focused on ways to realize the outcome of the China-ASEAN
Informal Summit held here last December.
</P>
<P>
During the consultation, the two sides agreed to expand
cooperation in the fields of economy and trade, investment as well
as science and technology to promote the Sino-ASEAN
good-neighborly partnership of mutual trust towards the 21st
century, a Chinese official attending the consultation told Xinhua
at the end of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also discussed the economic and financial
situation in Asia and agreed that favorable conditions exist for
economic development in Asia and the current difficulties faced by
Asia are only temporary, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He said both sides are fully confident of the future of Asia's
development.
</P>
<P>
Both sides were also of the view that the consultation was
frank, friendly, fruitful and successful, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) member
countries spoke highly of China's important contribution to
stabilizing the regional financial situation by committing not to
devalue its currency and by extending financial assistance to
countries affected by the financial turmoil in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to exchange views and coordinate on how to
strengthen regional financial cooperation and reforms as well as
to improve the international economic and financial order.
</P>
<P>
At the consultation, both sides also briefed each other on
their respective developments and exchanged views on regional and
international issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
At the consultation, Chinese delegation leader and assistant
foreign minister Chen Jian backed ASEAN in continuing to play an
active role in regional affairs, and expressed satisfaction over
the development of the friendly relations between China and ASEAN
since China became a full dialogue partner of the regional
grouping.
</P>
<P>
Chen reiterated China's consistent stand that China wishes to
strengthen the good-neighborly and friendly relations with its
neighboring countries. He said the friendly relationship between
China and ASEAN not only has a solid foundation but also enjoys
the prospect of multi-level multi-sectoral development.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that to strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation

of China and that of each ASEAN country.

difficulties affecting the regional economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen stressed that what China has been doing to help the
countries to overcome their difficulties is without any condition

see further development in the region on the basis of peace and
stability, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 17 (Xinhua) -- A new report presented by
the Executive Chairman of the United Nations Special Commission
(UNSCOM) Richard Butler says Friday that Iraq has made no new
progress in disarmament.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM, in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction, is requested to present a report on the progress in
Iraq's disarmament in every six months.
</P>
<P>
The report says Iraq has so far failed to provide UNSCOM with
any new information on its weapons, and virtually no progress in
verifying disarmament has been made.
</P>
<P>
This report came after technical surveys that left questions
about Iraqi compliance in biological, chemical, nuclear and
missile programs.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council of the United Nations is expected to
consider this report early next week. It will also use the report
as a basis for deciding by the end of this month whether to ease
the tough economic sanctions imposed on Iraq after its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Ambassador to the United
Nations Bill Richardson announced on Friday in Kabul that he had
secured a ceasefire from the Afghan Taliban militia and won their
agreement to hold talks with the opposition forces by April 27.
</P>
<P>
Richardson, who is visiting the region as a special envoy of
U.S. President Bill Clinton, said it was a major breakthrough in
the past 18 years, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Richardson, who arrived in Kabul earlier Friday, held a
two-hour meeting with Mullah Mohammad Rabbani, the second most
senior leader of the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
"It appears we have a breakthrough that if the northern
alliance agrees we will have talks between the Taliban and the
northern alliance in Islamabad before April 27," Richardson told
reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Until then we have the Taliban's commitment that there will be
no fresh Taliban offensive," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that it depends on deeds and not just words. But the
most important thing is "we have a process started that could lead
to talks under the U.N. auspices," he said.
</P>
<P>
Richardson also said the Taliban had agreed to release a
"significant number" of opposition prisoners in the next two days
in a goodwill gesture to back the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Richardson is scheduled to meet leaders of the anti-Taliban
alliance -- ethnic Uzbek warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum, ousted
president Burhannudin Rabbani and a Shiite faction leader Karim
Khalili in the opposition-held northern town of Sheberghan later
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Richardson said his aim in northern Afghanistan would be to
secure an agreement of the anti-Taliban alliance leadership to the
same deal.

<HEADLINE> FAA Calls for Boeing 737s Wiring Repair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) has proposed changes in wiring and fuel vents
on Boeing 737s in an effort to cut the risk of fuel tank
explosion.
</P>
<P>
The FAA order on Thursday would affect all but about 100 of the
nearly 3,000 Boeing 737s in operation worldwide, including 1,140
registered in the United States, The Washington Post quoted Boeing
officials as saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
The proposals are similar to those made by the agency last
November on 747s, the model of airplane used in the TWA 800 flight
that exploded shortly after takeoff from New York Kennedy
International Airport on July 17, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The crash, killing all 230 people on board, was caused by an
explosion in the center fuel tank, according to investigators. But
investigators have yet found what caused the deadly spark. They
have examined closely the wiring in fuel-monitoring systems used
in both the 747 and the 737.
</P>
<P>
In a 1990 accident involving a Philippine Airlines 737, the
center fuel tank exploded shortly after the plane pushed back from
the ramp at the Manila airport.
</P>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board and the FAA agree that
a possible source is low-voltage wires in the fuel quantity
indicating system.
</P>
<P>
Under Boeing's design, low-voltage wires that connect fuel
gauges in the cockpit with the fuel tank are bundled with hundreds
of other wires, including some carrying high-voltage electricity,
the Post said.

LUSAKA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- A senior Zambian official Friday
called for the revival of the joint permanent commission between
Zambia and Algeria to enhance cooperation and trade between the
two countries, reported the Zambia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Affairs Minister Keli Walubita made the appeal when
Algerian ambassador to Zambia, Mergak Benimew called on him.
</P>
<P>
The joint permanent commission on cooperation and trade which
lasted up to 1986 should urgently be revived to foster trade
between the two countries, said Walubita.
</P>
<P>
He said that Zambia and Algeria share common principles and
there is need to strengthen political and economic links that
will enhance development in both countries.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian foreign minister condemned the military upheavals
against the Algerian government, saying "Zambia is agianst all
forms of violence aimed at taking over political power by
unconstitutional means."
</P>
<P>
"Usurping power from a democratically elected government by
force should never be tolerated on the African soil because it
retrards development," Walubita stressed.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Walubita also appealed to Algeria to assist
Zambia with relief food to feed close to a million people faced
with starvation caused by drought and flooding.
</P>
<P>

to support the belateral relations existing between the two
nations.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Intensify Campaign on Partylist System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' Commission on
Elections (Comelec) said Friday that it will intensify its massive
information dissemination on the party-list system to be used for
the first time in the May 11 general elections.
</P>
<P>
Comelec Director Augusto Toledo told reporters that the
commission started this week its information campaign nationwide
to explain to the people the importance of the party-list system.
</P>
<P>
The party-list system is a mechanism of proportional
representation in the election of members to the House of
Representatives from marginalized or under-represented parties.
</P>
<P>
It enables small political parties and marginalized and
under-represented sectors to obtain possible representation in the
lower chamber which, traditionally, is dominated by parties with
big political machinery.
</P>
<P>
Instead of individual candidates, only registered organized
groups such as sectoral groups from labor, peasants, urban poor,
indigenous cultural communities, elderly, handicapped, women,
youth, overseas workers, fisher folk, veterans and professionals
can participate in the party-list election.
</P>
<P>
A party should obtain at least 2 percent of the total votes
cast for the party-list system nationwide in order to be allocated
with one seat at the lower house; 4 percent for two seats; and 6
percent for three seats.
</P>
<P>
Toledo said that as of March 17, there were a total of 122
registered organized groups accredited by the Comelec to
participate in the coming May 11 elections.
</P>
<P>
He said all polling booths shall have a list of all candidates
running for elective positions, including those in the party-list.
</P>
<P>
Toledo said 20 percent of the total membership in the House of
Representatives are reserved for party-list representatives. For
this year, there will be 51 seats for sectoral representatives.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Toledo encouraged the different party-list
participants to help the Comelec disseminate information to the
more than 34 million registered voters all over the country
regarding the importance of the party-list system.
</P>
<P>
The country's first party-list election will be held
simultaneously with the national and local elections during which
voters will also elect the president, the vice president, 12 of
the 20 senators, 204 members of the lower house by constituency,
and thousands of local officials.

<HEADLINE> Security Beefed Up in Food Warehouses in Famine-hit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Police authorities have
strengthened security measures in six warehouses of the National
Food Authority (NFA) in a famine-hit southern Philippine province
to thwart any attempt to ransack the facilities, a food official
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
NFA provincial manager Remegio Samsom said police authorities
have doubled the number of cops deployed in the warehouses in
South Cotabato province and strengthened detective surveillance
around the facilities.
</P>
<P>
Samson explained that the additional security is in response to
reports that several groups are out to ransack NFA warehouses in
nearby Sultan Kudarat province.
</P>
<P>
"We did not receive any similar threat, but, it is better for
us to be prepared," Samson said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that with the present food shortage problem brought
about by the El Nino-induced long drought in the province, it is
possible that certain groups will ransack grain warehouses.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Red Cross on Thursday called for donations from
the private sector in order to ease the food shortage problem in
Mindanao, the southern Philippines, where about 2.2 million people
have been affected.
</P>
<P>
A massive food shortage has hit Mindanao since last month as
months of dry spells caused by El Nino rendered almost thousands
of hectares of farmland in the region parched up.
</P>
<P>
El Nino, a weather phenomenon caused by recurrent ocean warming
and atmospheric disturbance in the Southern Pacific, began to hit
the Philippines in the last quarter of 1997.

<P>
HARARE, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe said Friday that the government is committed to revamp the
education system by putting greater emphasis on the development
of skills in the youths.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to hundreds of children coming from all provinces to
celebrate Zimbabwe's 18th anniversary of independence which falls
on Saturday, Mugabe said that the present education system tends
to emphasize literal abilities rather than skills development,
the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"We want to see greater emphasis made on the development of
various skills, skills that children can use as useful citizens
in society," said the president.
</P>
<P>
"That is why we have decided to re-examine our system of
education so that we can adjust the system and correct those
areas which need to be corrected," Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Zimbabwe has made great strides in
national development since independence, but there are some areas
which has met with only limited success.
</P>
<P>
He urged the children to remember that some gallant sons and
daughters of Zimbabwe had sacrificed their lives in the struggle
for national liberation and independence.

LAGOS, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Health Minister Jibrila
Ayinla has warned against the alarming rate at which the HIV/AIDS
infection is spreading in the west African country.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a news conference in Abuja Friday, the minister
disclosed that an estimated 2.5 million Nigerians are already
infected with AIDS/HIV virus, while 1,400 new infections are
occuring everyday.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, about 80 percent of the total
infections were through sexual transmission, though blood
transfusion is also a common mode of transmission.
</P>
<P>
Ayinla said that his ministry, with assistance from the
federal government, will organize a massive awareness campaign
for the civil servants from April 21 to 22.
</P>
<P>
The campaign, he said, is necessary because of the high degree
of complacency, cynicism and apathy among the public.
</P>
<P>
As part of the campaign, civil servants will be given lectures
on the facts and fictions of HIV/AIDS infections, he added.

<HEADLINE> Cola War Enters Indian Courts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 17 (Xinhua) -- A intense cola war entered
Indian courts on Friday with Pepsi accusing its rival Cola-Cola of
engineering defection of key employees, bottlers and consultants
through unfair and illegal means.
</P>
<P>
After hearing Pepsi's plea, Justice C. M. Nayar of Delhi High
Court issued notices and summons to Cola-Cola and 15 others but
refused to grant exparte injunction sought by Pepsico India to
stop alleged inducements by Cola-Cola in offering employment to
Pepsi's employees during pendency of the suit.
</P>
<P>
Arguing for Pepsi, senior advocates Ashok Desai and Arun
Jaitley contended that Cola-Cola "rattled by the huge success of
Pepsi in India entered into a conspiracy during the last six
months to cause loss and damage to Pepsi's business interests by
adopting unfair and illegal means."
</P>
<P>
Pepsi outperformed the Atlanta-based Cola-Cola in India with a
growth of 27 percent against 21 percent posted by Cola-Cola in the
first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Pepsi, emerged as leader in soft drinks in India, claimed that
Cola-Cola has approached many key managers and has been successful
in luring a commercial manager of its bottling business.
</P>
<P>
While initially these approaches were sporadic and without a
pattern, over the last six months it is clear that Cola-Cola has
changed its strategy and has decided to consciously target and
approach key employees of Pepsi at various locations in India,
Pepsi said in its plaint.
</P>
<P>
The advocates told the court that the Cola-Cola's action would
directly harm the business interests of Pepsi, which has invested
over 300 million U.S. dollars in the South Asian country for the
establishment of business infrastructure.

<HEADLINE> Annan Decides Immediate Withdrawal of UN Investigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 17 (Xinhua) -- UN secretary-General Kofi
Annan has decided to withdraw immediately the investigation team
he sent to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to look into
allegations of serious violations of human rights and
international humanitarian law in certain parts of the country, UN
Spokesman Fred Eckhard announced on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the investigation team was intended to
bridge the impasse which had arisen as a result of the refusal of
the Government of DRC to allow a Joint Investigative Mission of
the Commission on Human Rights to investigate the allegation.
</P>
<P>
However, since its arrival in DRC in August 1997, the
investigation team constantly met a series of obstacles by the DRC
authorities.
</P>
<P>
In the most recent incident in this pattern of obstruction, the
DRC authorities on April 7 and 8 expelled a member of
investigation team form the investigation site and subsequently
detained him at Kinshasa airport.
</P>
<P>
Confidential UN documents in the possession of the staff member
were seized, searched and assumed to have been photocopied by the
DRC authorities in complete disregards of the obligations of
Member States under the Convention on the Privileges and
Immunities of the United Nations.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Sonia Starts National Campaign to Revitalize Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 17 (Xinhua) -- India's Congress President
Sonia Gandhi Friday announced a three-pronged strategy to
revitalize her party which had a poor showing in the
February-March general elections.
</P>
<P>
Sonia made the announcement at a public gathering in Motihari,
the east state of Bihar, on the first leg of her national campaign
to revitalize the Congress, according to the Press Trust of India.
</P>
<P>
The Congress had become weak as senior leaders lost direct
contact with the rank and file for years, Sonia said, adding that
one way to strengthen the party is to give proper attention to
grassroots workers.
</P>
<P>
"We have to take fundamental steps to infuse new strength in
the party," she told 25,000 supporters at the rally.
</P>
<P>
"Without total identification with the common worker, breathing
fresh life into the organization would remain a distant dream,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
The second step is to win back minority communities that lost
trust in the party, and the third is to give more power to women.
</P>
<P>
Sonia started talking with Congressmen soon after taking over
as president of the party, and has already met leaders of almost
all the parties in both houses of parliament.

<HEADLINE> Somalia: Hostage Release Efforts Meet With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Efforts to secure the hostages
of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) kidnaped
by some Somali gunmen in Mogadishu on Wednesday have met with
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Somali Faction leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed, since his arrival on
Thursday night, has not spared a minute in securing the safe
release of the 10 aid workers of the ICRC abducted at the Issaley
airstrip.
</P>
<P>
Faction leader Osman Ali Atto, together with other officials
from his faction and some local politicians, were also in north
Mogadishu Friday working for the release of the ICRC aid workers.
</P>
<P>
The release efforts have also been joined by the the
prestigious lmam of Abgal, lmam Mohamud lmam Omar, Mogadishu's
former mayor Ali Ugas Abdulle and many other Abgal traditional
leaders.
</P>
<P>
It was said that the abductors have elected eight members from
their side to represent them in the talks they are having with
the Abgal traditional leaders.
</P>
<P>
Several attempts have already been made in securing their
release, but it seems that each time some new difficulties have
been encountered.
</P>
<P>
According to one of Osman Atto's officials and the local
Somali Red Crescent society workers, all of the kidnaped are
doing fine and fed well.
</P>
<P>
Though the Red Crescent workers believe that the current
efforts may lead to the release of the hostages by the end of
Friday, the story doesn't seem to come to an end on Friday
despite all efforts.
</P>
<P>
Mogadishu's Joint Health Authority (JHA) Friday condemned the
continuous abduction of the ICRC staff members in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
JHA Coordinator Osman Mohamud Dufle has characterized the
abduction as " inhumane " and contrary to what he called the
noble task of the ICRC in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
JHA has called for the immediate and unconditional release of
the ICRC aid workers, whom have come to Somalia for further
improving the humanitarian operations of the country.

<HEADLINE> Chile, Mexico Sign Two Agreements to Expand Economic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, Chile, April 17 (Xinhua) -- President Eduardo Frei
Ruiz-Tagle of Chile and President Eduardo Zedillo Ponce de Leon
Friday signed two agreements in a bid to expand economic ties
between the two Latin American nations.
</P>
<P>
The two accords include the Enlargement of the Economic
Complementation Agreement (EECA) and a Pact to Avoid the Double
Taxation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The EECA is signed to replace the original one signed in 1991.
The new accord has contained some sectors such as services and
telecommunications which were excluded in the previous agreement.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Chilean and Mexican trade relations have
developed rapidly. The two-way trade amount increased from only
158.4 million U.S. dollars in 1990 to some 1452 million dollars
last year as a result of enhanced cooperation between the two
nations.
</P>
<P>
As regarding to the Agreement to Avoid Double Taxation, it
represents a great advance for the cooperation between
entrepreneurs of both nations and region-wide as well, because cost
reduction due to tax charges will not only benefit the two
countries, but also their neighboring countries.

<HEADLINE> Strong Pound Might Cause UK Recession, BCC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 17 (Xinhua) - British industry has urged Bank of
England to call a halt to interest rises as evidence showed that
impact caused by the strong pound has spread from manufacturing
into the services sector.
</P>
<P>
Export sales and orders for UK firms have slumped to a
seven-year low, according the latest quarterly economic survey
from the British Chambers of Commerce(BCC).
</P>
<P>
Currency traders ignored the weak data to send the pound
surging higher again on the foreign exchanges as concern mounted
over deepening divisions in the Bank of England's monetary policy
committee.
</P>
<P>
Sterling climbed three pennies to DM3.0592 against the mark
and its trade weighted index rose a full point to 108.1 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The sterling index, which measures the pound's average
international value, climbed from 107.1 to 108.1, close to the
10-year high touched earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Confirming other evidence of the weak state of manufacturing in
the first few months of this year, the survey revealed slower
employment growth and lower investment intentions.
</P>
<P>
Analysts in the City believe that collapsing export growth will
produce weak GDP growth in both the first and second quarters.
</P>
<P>
Ian Peters, deputy director-general of the BCC, said: "There is
no justification for further interest rate rises. The Bank of
England must now display a united front and make it clear that
interest rates have peaked."
</P>
<P>
"Failure to do so, or a decision to raise interest rates
further, may be all that is needed to tip the manufacturing sector
into recession," he warned.
</P>
<P>
However, for the second month in a row, according to the
minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee, Eddie George, the
Governor of the Bank, had to use his casting vote to keep interest
rates unchanged in February and March.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates in Britain have remained flat at 7.25 percent since
November, having risen five times since the general election last
May.

<HEADLINE> Angola Denies Its Troops Presence in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Angola's Ministry of Defense
Friday categorically denied that it has sent troops to Mozambique
to "sabotage the first local elections after peace achieves
there."
</P>
<P>
Defense Ministry spokesman Bravo Da Rosa made the announcement
to the media here, saying that there is not a single soldier in
the northern city of Beira and elsewhere in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Rosa said that the reports on this issue from some
foreign news agencies are "groundless."
</P>
<P>
These days some foreign newspapers have been carrying stories
claiming that Angolan troops had been deployed to Mozambique to
obstruct and sabotage the local elections scheduled to be held in
June, and Rosa said the Angolan Defense Ministry was shocked to
learn of such false reports.
</P>
<P>
He noted that no Angolan armed forces has ever been deployed
to the Mozambican territory.
</P>
<P>
In term of bilateral cooperation in military technologies,
Rosa admitted that Angola and Mozambique has signed a protocol of
intention in the field of officers training.
</P>
<P>
"There are no Mozambican troops in Angola and there are no
Angolan troops in Mozambique, either," he said, since the
protocol has not been implemented yet.

<HEADLINE> Mkapa Presses for Miners' Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 17 (Xinhua) -- President Benjamin Mkapa
Friday said his government will review safety measures in mines
to avert further unnecessary disasters, a report reaching here
from the northern region of Arusha said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing villagers at Mererani in Arusha, where more than 90
people are feared to have been buried alive last week, Mkapa said
his government is concerned with the safety of miners, and will
do whatever possible to ensure that there is enough protection
for them.
</P>
<P>
The miners, mostly aged between 12 and 25, were buried by a
landslide following heavy rains last Thursday. So far, eight
bodies have been identified.
</P>
<P>
The rescue operation has gained momentum following the arrival
of six high-voltage submersible pumps from Geita, Moshi and Tanga
areas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Australia has provided equipment worth 5,000 U.S.
Dollars for the rescue operation, including a submersible pump,
masks, gloves, ropes, high power torches and batteries.
</P>
<P>
The president, who came back Thursday evening from a state
visit to China, also assured small-scale miners in the area that
the government will offer equipment to guarantee their safety
inside the mining pits.
</P>
<P>
"We have been deeply touched with the loss of lives in
Mererani, and we should learn lessons from it to avert any such
disasters in the future," he said to some 4,000 villagers.
</P>
<P>
According to Mkapa, efforts are also underway to exchange
experiences with South Africa and Zimbabwe, which have been in
the mining business for a long time.

<HEADLINE> British Prime Minister Holds Talks with Mubarak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Visiting British Prime Minister
Tony Blair held talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
here Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
Blair arrived here Friday afternoon on a two-day visit to Egypt
as part of his multi-leg maiden tour of the Middle East aimed at
giving a shot to the stalled Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Blair, accompanied by a team of diplomats specialized in Middle
East affairs and a number of journalists, was greeted at the
airport by Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri.
</P>
<P>
The talks between Mubarak and Blair will focus on the European
role in helping break a year-long stalemate in the Mideast peace
process. Britain is currently holding the rotating presidency of
the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have been bogged down for
13-month over the Israeli construction of a Jewish settlement in
Arab East Jerusalem and over the scope and time scale of an
overdue Israeli pullback from the West Bank. Negotiations on the
Syrian and Lebanese tracks have been on ice since February 1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ways of fostering Anglo-Egyptian economic relations
will figure high during Blair's talks with the Egyptian leader.
Britain is Egypt's second largest non-Arab investor after the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Blair, on his debut trip to the region since taking office last
year, will explore prospects for stronger ties with Egypt during
meetings with Ganzouri and Foreign Minister Amr Moussa Saturday.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, he is also scheduled to meet with members of the
British-Egyptian businessmen Association to examine the
possibility of increasing joint investments.
</P>
<P>
During his Cairo trip, Blair will meet with Grand Sheikh of
Al-Azhar Mohamed Sayed Tantawi, Egypt's top religious scholar,
before leaving for Saudi Arabia, the second leg in his Mideast
tour which will also take him to Jordan, Israel and the
Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
The tour comes at a time when Europe is urged to play a more
active role in the stalemated Mideast peace process, especially
since the U.S.-dominated mediation efforts have so far failed to
unlock the peace logjam. U.S. Mideast peace envoy Dennis Ross will
begin a new round of shuttle diplomacy in the region in the coming
days.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who toured the region
last month, was snubbed in Israel allegedly for breaching an
understanding on the arrangements of his visit to the Har Homa in
East Jerusalem. Israel's Jewish settlement construction work at
the site is behind the long freeze in Palestinian-Israeli talks.
</P>
<P>
Britain has made it clear that the status of Jerusalem, the
thorniest issue in the Palestinian-Israeli track, should be
decided at the final stage of their negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Israel has repeatedly rejected European involvement in the
peace process, favoring an absolute mediating role for the
United States.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Eritrean President Isaias
Afwerki has said that Ethiopia and Eritrea are embarking upon a
new stage of cooperation, the Ethiopian News Agency reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Isaias made the announcement in an interview with ASER, an
Ethiopian magazine published in Tigrigna language, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, the two countries are now moving
toward a new stage of cooperation which will have a significant
bearing on their economies.
</P>
<P>
The policies which now appear to be incompatible will
eventually be in tune after the two countries have passed through
the new stage, the president noted, adding that the condition on
the ground now will serve the purpose of testing the viability of
the policies exercised in both countries.
</P>
<P>
The government of Eritrea is against the application of the
Letter of Credit (LC) and the use of foreign currency to conduct
transactions because it is of the opinion that such a procedure
is incompatible with the reality on the ground, the president
said.
</P>
<P>
Biltateral ties remain good despite the new policies
implemented by Addis to safeguard its own interests which he said
do not imply a shift of stance on the part of the Ethiopian
People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) or the Ethiopian
government regarding relations with the Eritrean people and the
state, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In an earlier issue, ASER carried a statement by Ethiopian
Premier Meles Zenawi on the use of Letter of Credit and hard
currency in transactions between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Meles underlined in his statement that the new policy will
equally benefit buyers as well as traders, the news agency
reported.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Open Consulate in Kenya's Second City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Uganda government will open
a consulate in port Mombasa, the second largest city in Kenya, to
deal with ware-housing and dispatch of Ugandan imports and
exports from the port, a Ugandan minister has said.
</P>
<P>
Abel Rwendeire, visiting Ugandan Minister of State for Trade
and Industry, said Thursday the consulate would also deal with
harmonization of documents for goods of imports or exports so
that they could reach their destinations on time, the Kenya News
Agency (KNA) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
On a familiarization tour of the port, the Ugandan minister
appealed to the Kenya Port Authority (KPA) management to set
aside a specific place where cargo meant for export to Uganda is
kept within six months in order to eradicate the diversion of
export cargo to Kenya's local market.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that Kenya and Uganda had agreed that all
bottlenecks hampering the smooth and efficient dispatch and
offloading of cargo would soon be addressed to.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with the Ugandan minister, Samuel Maneno,
chairman of the KPA Board of Directors, said higher tariffs at
the ware houses would be regularized in an effort to attract more
Ugandan imports and exports.
</P>
<P>
More than 600 containers destined for Uganda, a land-locked
country, were currently stockpiled at the port due to
documentation irregularities and bad road conditions between
Mombasa and the capital Nairobi, Maneno noted.
</P>
<P>
The KPA chairman added that information about goods to be
auctioned would be streamlined so that Ugandans could be able to
buy them by reading their daily newspapers.

<TEXT>
<P>

Mrs. Meilleur died peacefully Thursday afternoon at 117,
according to her daughter Olive Therrien who is 78 years old
herself.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Germany's SPD Poises for Power Change in Bonn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Eager to put an end to the
misfortune of 16 years in opposition, Germany's leftist Social
Democratic Party (SPD) Friday formally endorsed Gerhard Schroeder
as its chancellor candidate and adopted an election platform
pledging to bring about changes and especially new jobs in the
country.
</P>
<P>
With only five months to go before the September 27 general
elections, the SPD confirmed the nomination of Schroeder,
54-year-old premier of the western German Lower Saxony state, by
an overwhelming majority of 93 percent of the vote at a special
party congress in the eastern German city of Leipzig on Friday.
</P>
<P>
As a pro-business moderate, Schroeder was widely seen as the
strongest SPD candidate since 1982 because he has more chance of
winning vital centrist votes, which are also much needed by German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's center-right ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
Declaring "the Kohl era is over," Schroeder told the 515
delegates at the congress that he was ready to take over the
German leadership to face challenges in a new century.
</P>
<P>
He pledged to make it the top priority of a SPD-led government
to fight the country's record high unemployment, a major rebuff
for Kohl's government, and to take a pragmatic approach to resolve
the problems facing Germany.
</P>
<P>
The SPD congress on Friday also adopted an election platform
calling for policy change in Bonn in order to achieve new economic
dynamic, new jobs, as well as to promote a new social culture
based on consensus and justice.
</P>
<P>
To fight unemployment, the SPD pledged more state spendings on
job creation and called for more flexible and shorter working
hours and more part-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
It also pledged to double state spendings on education and
research within the next five years and envisaged a gradual tax
reform aiming at cutting lowest income tax rate from the current
25.9 percent to 15 percent, and the highest tax rate from 53
percent to 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
Helped by rising public discontent with high unemployment and a
general desire for changes, the SPD has been leading Kohl's
Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party in almost all opinion polls
over the past one year.
</P>
<P>
The latest survey published by the German ZDF television
network on Friday also showed that if elections were held now, the
SPD would win 43 percent of the vote compared with just 35 percent
for Kohl's party.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Friday congress of the SPD, some critics,
however, pointed out that the party had failed to deliver a clear
message to launch fundamental economic reforms which are necessary
for Germany to withstand competitive pressures stemming both from
globalization as well as the new common European currency.
</P>
<P>
Kohl's CDU party on Friday also criticized the SPD platform as
full of rhetoric and lack in concrete details.
</P>
<P>
Despite his vulnerability after so many years in power, Kohl
has been open about the necessity for change while Schroeder has
been vague so far, political analysts argue.
</P>
<P>
Sharp criticism came also from Germany's Greens party on Friday
with one of its leaders, Juergen Trittin, saying that the SPD had
no concept to resolve the country's social problems.
</P>
<P>
It has been expected that the SPD would have to rely on an
alliance with the Greens to come to power after the elections.
</P>
<P>
However, the feasibility of such a "Red-Green" coalition has
been thrown into doubt recently after the Greens unveiled a series
of radical positions, calling for tripling the country's gasoline
prices and abolition of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO).
</P>
<P>
Given the uncertainty over the Red-Green alliance, there are
growing speculations about a possible grand coalition between the
CDU and the SPD.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Foreign Trade Improved in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Canada's exports and imports
improved in February, rising 2.2 and 0.9 percent respectively,
Statistics Canada reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Canada exported a total of 26.36 billion dollars' (18.45
billion USD) worth of goods to other countries in February, after
a fall of about one billion dollars in January.
</P>
<P>
"The machinery and equipment sector led the way with a solid
performance," the statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
After slipping 1.4 percent in January, machinery and equipment
exports jumped 6.6 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
The increase was largely due to higher exports of television
and communications equipment to the Scandinavian countries and
railway equipment to the United States and Asia, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Canada's imports recovered slightly in
February, totalling 24.53 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Moderate growth in machinery and equipment, energy products,
and automotive product imports was partly offset by the declines
in imports of industrial goods and agriculture and fishing
products.
</P>
<P>
Canada's trade balance was 1.83 billion dollars in February, up
more than 300 million dollars from January.

<HEADLINE> 2 Priests Sentenced to Death on Genocide Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The court in Rwanda's Western
Kibuye Prefecture handling genocide cases Thursday sentenced to
death two Roman Catholic priests, radio Rwanda reported Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
The two priests, father Jean Francois Kayiranga and father
Edoaurd Nkurikiye were found guilty of genocide crimes they
committed at Nyundo, 20 km east of Gisenyi town during the 1994
genocide.
</P>
<P>
They were also found guilty of slaughtering about 2,000 people
in Nyange parish. The two priests who had been involved in the

church housing refugees.
</P>
<P>
The driver of the caterpillar machine, Anastase Nkinamubanzi,
who was paid to destroy the church was sentenced to life
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
A Congolese national, Andrew Labo Kasongo, who was heading the
road construction works on behalf of the Italian company Astaldi
was acquitted.
</P>
<P>
This is the first condemnation of church leaders who were

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Lebanon, Syria to Launch Diplomatic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon and its ally Syria have
drafted a joint five-point diplomatic action plan to counter
Israel's conditional offer to pull its forces out of south
Lebanon, Lebanon's independent Central News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The plan came after intensive talks in Damascus Thursday among
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and Foreign Minister Fares
Boueiz and Syrian Vice President Abdul-Halim Khaddam, according to
the news agency.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the two sides reached an understanding on a
mechanism for a political and diplomatic action to explain the
background of the latest Israeli maneuver that is aimed at
scuttling the peace process.
</P>
<P>
On April 1, Israel, for the first time in the past two
decades, approved the United Nations Resolution 425 and offered
to withdraw its troops from south Lebanon in exchange for
Lebanese security guarantees.
</P>
<P>
Israel is now occupying a 1,200-square-kilometer border enclave
in south Lebanon with the claimed aim of protecting its northern
settlements from Lebanese guerrilla cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
It has been also occupying Syria's Golan Heights since the 1967
Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria have always insisted that their negotiations
with Israel be held simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
The two countries firmly rejected Israel's offer on the grounds
that the U.N. resolution 425 calls for an unconditional Israeli
withdrawal from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
However, the two countries are facing the international
pressure to consider the offer seriously due to Israel's
diplomatic endeavors to promote its proposal in the world,
especially in the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Under the Lebanese-Syrian action plan, Lebanon will explain to
the world community why it finds the Israeli offer unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
It will also reply to the letter sent by U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright last week and another letter by French
Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
In her letter, Albright asked Lebanon to study Israel's
proposal seriously.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine said in his letter that France strongly favors anything
that could bring about a solution satisfactory to Lebanon, Syria
and Israel.
</P>
<P>
According to the action plan, Lebanon will also send letters to
the five permanent members of the U.N. security council, the
non-aligned nations, members of the Arab League and others to
explain Lebanon's rejection to the Israeli offer.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Lebanese government will summon the
ambassadors of the five permanent members of the security council
in Beirut to explain Lebanon's position on the issue.
</P>
<P>
As part of the plan, Lebanese prime minister and foreign
minister will visit the five permanent members of the security
council as well as a number of Arab countries including Saudi
Arabia, Egypt and Morocco.
</P>
<P>
Their global tour is set to begin next Tuesday when Hariri
travels to Cairo for a previously arranged meeting with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
His visit to Egypt will come on the heels of Syrian President
Hafez al-Assad who held talks with Mubarak on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But no dates have been disclosed for visits to the other
countries.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese media predicted that Syria will carry out diplomatic
activities after assessing the outcome of the Lebanese efforts.

<HEADLINE> Shuttle Columbia Blasts Off From Cape Canaveral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. space shuttle Columbia
after one-day delay was launched into space Friday from Kennedy
Space Center, Cape Canaveral, at 2:19 p.m. EDP.
</P>
<P>
On its 25th flight, shuttle Columbia carried a seven-member
crew and a menagerie of more than 2,000 creatures,including
pregnant mice, rats, snails, fish and crickets.
</P>
<P>
During a two-week long flight, NASA scientists will conduct
26 biological experiments called the Neurolab. It is their hope
that these experiments would provide the most in-depth study
ever of the brain and nervous system in space. The seven
astronauts and menagerie of animals will serve as the test subjects.
</P>
<P>
Through these experiments, scientists want to know how the nervous
system adjusts to weightlessness, so as to make NASA in a better
position to send astronauts to Mars and establish moon colonies.
NASA also is eager to understand and solve some of the nagging
health problems such as insomnia, vertigo, imbalance, reduced
blood pressure, weakened immunity and dizziness upon landing.
</P>
<P>
Space shuttle Columbia, originally scheduled for blastoff on
Thursday, was postponed till today because one of it's two
network signal processors failed to receive signal.

<HEADLINE> Automatic Sea Rescue System Turns 40 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Automated Mutual-assistance
Vessel Rescue system (AMVER) launches an international celebration
of 40 years of saving lives at sea this year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Coast Guard and the International Maritime
Organization created the worldwide search and rescue program 46
years after Titanic, the luxury liner's tragic accident. Lack of
communication during the Titanic's sinking produced new ideas for
protecting travel at sea.
</P>
<P>
In 1958, computer technology enabled the idea to become reality.
</P>
<P>
The AMVER safety network is a primary search and rescue tool
covering practically all the oceans in an emergency at sea. AMVER
is a voluntary, worldwide ship reporting system involving ships
from 143 nations. Participating ships send AMVER their sailing
plans prior to departure and regular position updates throughout
their voyage.
</P>
<P>
A computer, located in Martinsburg, West Virginia, stores this
information and uses a system of dead reckoning, provides the
projected position of about 2,700 ships in every ocean of the
world each day.
</P>
<P>
Rescue planners are able to locate the area of the ocean on the
computer screen. A "surface picture" depicts the relative position
of all AMVER-participating vessels nearby, from a 50-500 mile
radius, in a pattern similar to an air traffic controller's
screen. The nearby vessels will be informed timely if an emergency
occurs.

UNITED NATIONS, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council of the
United Nations on Friday decided to extend the mandate of the
United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara
(MINURSO) for a further period of three months until July 20,
1998.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the Council considered U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan's latest report on Western Sahara. In the report, the
U.N. chief said the the Government of Morocco and the POLISARIO have
a sharp dispute over the identifications of three tribes and there
has been a perceptible increase in the level of tension between
them.
</P>
<P>
In its resolution unanimously adopted, the Security Council
called on the two parties to comply with the agreements
reached and cooperate fully with MINURSO.
</P>
<P>
The Council also urged the two parties to solve their disputes
through dialogue as soon as possible so as to resume the
identification process.

<HEADLINE> 70 Hutu Militiamen Killed in C. Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan military sources
said Friday that the army killed over 70 Hutu militiamen
Wednesday in Buringa Commune, in the country's central Gitarama
Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
"Following a tip by local residents, security forces moved in
and clashed with the militia," the Rwanda News Agency (RNA)
quoted the sources as saying. Over 70 militiamen perished in the
one-day battle, they said.
</P>
<P>
A lot of military equipment, including AK 47 and M16 assault
rifles, were captured by the Rwandan army, said the RNA. in a
special dispatch to Xinhua based in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
No casualty was given on the Rwandan army side and no civilian
was hurt in the operation.
</P>
<P>
It is said that to avoid civilian casualties, local people
evacuated the areas where the rebels had been spotted. The army
then encircled their positions before clamping down on them.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, 20 bodies of the rebels could still be seen on
the battlefield. Others were said to be in nearby forests and
swamps where it was very difficult to access immediately.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the militiamen were in military fatigues, others were
in civilian clothes and wore jungle boots," said a RNA
correspondent in Gitarama.
</P>
<P>
Old identity cards showing ethnic background of the bearers
were left on the battlefield by the running Hutu militiamen.
</P>
<P>
Abhorring the atrocities committed by the marauding militia,
some local residents expressed strong determination to support
the army in routing out trouble-makers.
</P>
<P>
"The militiamen come, they target genocide survivors, local
leaders, as well as anyone opposing them, or collaborating with
the government," one resident of Buramba told RNA.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, reports of atrocities by the fleeing
militiamen continue to emerge from neighboring communes.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday night, an unidentified number of Hutu militiamen
attacked two families in Mushubati Commune, killing 11 people.
</P>
<P>
"They came and killed the members of the two families with
hammers, and then burnt their houses," a local government
official told RNA, a private and independent news agency in
Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, mop-up operations were still going on in the
region, and more and more Hutu militiamen were killed, military
sources in Gitarama indicated.
</P>
<P>
Some of the militiamen were reportedly trying to cross back to
southern Gisenyi where they had attacked from about two months
ago. Others were running for safety in swamps and forests of
Ndiza region, re-grouping in the communes where insecurity had
heightened since late February.
</P>
<P>
For the past week alone, about 100 people had been killed in
different communes of Gitarama. Some of the victims, mainly
genocide survivors and local political leaders were hacked to
death with machetes, axes, and clubs.
</P>
<P>
While addressing a group of 1,523 former government soldiers
who had terminated solidarity camps in Nkumba Commune, in
northern Ruhengeri Prefecture Thursday, Major General Paul
Kagame, Rwandan Vice-President and Minister of Defense, strongly
condemned the continuing "genocidal acts" carried out by the very
forces behind the 1994 genocide.
</P>
<P>
"Criminals, those guided by ethnic ideology, those involved in
acts of destruction will never again rule Rwanda, lead Rwandans,"
Kagame underscored and appealed to Rwandans to unite against
these forces.
</P>
<P>
Major Richard Sezibera, the Rwandan army spokesman, told RNA
Friday that military operations are continuing but on low level.
</P>
<P>
"They come and they attack, but I do not think this will lead
them any further," he underlined.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Mixed, London Down on Profit-Taking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
ended the week mixed Friday, with Paris closing higher and
Frankfurt and London finishing down, dragged lower by
profit-taking which was triggered by Asian markets' steep falls.
</P>
<P>
Britain's FTSE-100 index of leading shares ended a lackluster
session lower for a fourth day in a row, down 79.8 points or 1.33
percent at 5,922.2, breaching the important 6,000-point level for
the first time in the month and a drop of 183.3 points from last
week.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that the market was unsettled by weakness in Asian
markets and by profit-taking after a strong first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Market sentiment was also dampened by a strong pound and
renewed concern over possible interest rates rise, they added.
</P>
<P>
But some analysts said that the market's retreat this week was
a healthy enough correction after the index surged 15.5 percent
during the first quarter of this year and they expected
bargain-hunting next week.
</P>
<P>
German shares in Frankfurt languished for much of the day and
closed down 55.39 points or 1.04 percent at 5,268.75 on the DAX-30
index, dragged lower by a lackluster dollar and a sharp overnight
drop on Wall Street. Equity strategists see further consolidation
next week.
</P>
<P>
However, the Paris bourse managed to close firmer, with the
CAC-40 index up 15.64 points or 0.41 percent at 3,861.58 after
having dropped nearly 1 percent earlier in the session, a fall of
32.9 points from last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that a late round of U.S.-inspired buying and
short-covering lifted the market.

"Some of the militiamen were in military fatigues, others were
in civilian clothes and wore jungle boots," said a RNA
correspondent in Gitarama.
</P>
<P>
Old identity cards showing ethnic background of the bearers
were left on the battlefield by the running Hutu militiamen.
</P>
<P>
Abhorring the atrocities committed by the marauding militia,
some local residents expressed strong determination to support
the army in routing out trouble-makers.
</P>
<P>
"The militiamen come, they target genocide survivors, local
leaders, as well as anyone opposing them, or collaborating with
the government," one resident of Buramba told RNA.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, reports of atrocities by the fleeing
militiamen continue to emerge from neighboring communes.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday night, an unidentified number of Hutu militiamen
attacked two families in Mushubati Commune, killing 11 people.
</P>
<P>
"They came and killed the members of the two families with
hammers, and then burnt their houses," a local government
official told RNA, a private and independent news agency in
Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, mop-up operations were still going on in the
region, and more and more Hutu militiamen were killed, military
sources in Gitarama indicated.
</P>
<P>
Some of the militiamen were reportedly trying to cross back to
southern Gisenyi where they had attacked from about two months
ago. Others were running for safety in swamps and forests of
Ndiza region, re-grouping in the communes where insecurity had
heightened since late February.
</P>
<P>
For the past week alone, about 100 people had been killed in
different communes of Gitarama. Some of the victims, mainly
genocide survivors and local political leaders were hacked to
death with machetes, axes, and clubs.
</P>
<P>
While addressing a group of 1,523 former government soldiers
who had terminated solidarity camps in Nkumba Commune, in
northern Ruhengeri Prefecture Thursday, Major General Paul
Kagame, Rwandan Vice-President and Minister of Defense, strongly
condemned the continuing "genocidal acts" carried out by the very
forces behind the 1994 genocide.
</P>
<P>
"Criminals, those guided by ethnic ideology, those involved in
acts of destruction will never again rule Rwanda, lead Rwandans,"
Kagame underscored and appealed to Rwandans to unite against
these forces.
</P>
<P>
Major Richard Sezibera, the Rwandan army spokesman, told RNA
Friday that military operations are continuing but on low level.
</P>
<P>
"They come and they attack, but I do not think this will lead
them any further," he underlined.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Turkey, Greece to Settle Disputes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States Friday expressed
its hope that Turkey and Greece would settle their disputes in a
peaceful way, local TV reports said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen, who arrived here
Friday on a two-day official visit, said that a peaceful
relationship between Ankara and Athens will be in the interests
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) of which Turkey
and Greece are members.
</P>
<P>
"It is our hope and expectation that the tensions... will be
settled and negotiated in a way that is responsible as members
of the NATO allies," Cohen told a joint press conference held
with his Turkish counterpart Ismet Sezgin following their
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Cohen stressed that both Turkey and Greece are important
allies of the U.S. and they will be treated without
discriminations.
</P>
<P>
Washington will provide equal military support to Turkey and
Greece, which will make the two gain the capability of defending
themselves as well as carrying out duties as NATO member states,
he said.
</P>
<P>
As traditional rivals, Turkey and Greece have long be at odds
over some issues including air space limits, sea-bed mineral
rights, sovereignty of some islets in the Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
The bitter Turco-Greek relationship is a headache for the NATO
which is afraid that such a state would weaken the collective
defense of the military bloc in the southeastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Sezgin, for his part, said that Turkey has never had an
intention to use force against Greece in order to solve its
disputes with the neighboring country.
</P>
<P>
"We are in favor of peace and friendship and hope to modernize
our forces to ensure peace and stability in the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
As to Turkey's attitude toward the NATO eastward expansion,
Cohen said that it's the U.S. hope that Turkey will take a
positive position regarding this issue.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government had said that whether Turkey supports
this project should be up to the Parliament under the
Constitution, indicating that the NATO efforts to admit new
members might be obstructed.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts noted that Ankara took such an attitude because
its bid for full membership of the European Union (EU) was denied
by some leading European nations which are also NATO members.
</P>
<P>
Cohen met with Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz Friday
morning and was received by Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
late Friday afternoon. They exchanged views over the measures to
further strengthen U.S.-Turkish relations.
</P>
<P>
Although both Cohen and Sezgin denied that Turkey had made the
requirement of purchasing advanced U.S. weapons, diplomatic
sources here believe that enhancing Turkish-U.S. cooperation in
the defense field is a major topic of the discussion.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary of defense will fly to the Incirlik air
base near Adana in southern Turkey to inspect the U.S. troops
stationed there to carry out the mission of Operation Northern
Watch designed to monitor northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Cohen will leave Turkey late Saturday to continue his Mideast
trip which will also take him to Jordan, Egypt, Israel as well as
Greece.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian, British Companies Sign Gas Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian General Petroleum
Company (EGPC) and the British Gas (BG) cut a deal Saturday to set
up a joint venture to transfer and distribute natural gas to
southern Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The 220-million-U.S.-dollar deal came at the end of British
Prime Minister Tony Blair's visit to Egypt. Blair and his Egyptian
counterpart Kamal el-Ganzouri were present when the agreement was
signed by BG chief executive David Valley and EGPC chairman Abdel
Khaled Ayad.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, the two companies will jointly set up a Nile
Valley Gas Company to undertake the development of gas market and
infrastructure in southern Egypt, the Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year franchise provides for phased construction of a gas
pipeline from Cairo to Upper Egypt. The first phase will see
transmission of gas from Cairo to industrial and domestic
consumers in Beni Suef, about 120 kilometers south.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline will be extended 270 kilometers to Assuit in the
second phase and then run further southward to the governorates of
Qena and Aswan in southern Egypt in the third and fourth phases.
</P>
<P>
BG will also begin work shortly on an extensive program of
exploring for gas in the Nile Delta, north of an area where it has
already found significant reserves.
</P>
<P>
Oil Minister Hamdi el-Banbi told reporters following the
signing ceremony that the agreement is a fruit of cooperation
between the governments and businessmen of the two countries and
that Egypt has become "an oasis for Arab and foreign investment."
</P>
<P>
Also on Saturday morning, Blair and Ganzouri co-launched the
British Egyptian Business Association Council to promote
cooperation between the two countries' private sectors with
support of their governments.
</P>
<P>
Britain is Egypt's fourth largest trading partner in Europe
after Italy, France and Germany, with their annual trade volume
topping 1 billion U.S. dollars,
</P>
<P>
It is also Egypt's largest direct investor with 1 billion
sterling pounds (some 1.67 billion dollars) annually and second
largest indirect stock market investor after the U.S., according
to Ganzouri, who described his business-smart British counterpart
as a "commercial politician."
</P>
<P>
Blair later left for Riyadh, Saudi Arabia after wrapping up his
two-day visit in Cairo, the first stop of his maiden five-day tour
of the Middle East. He will also travel to Jordan, Israel and the
Palestinian self-rule areas.

<HEADLINE> ECOSOC Hosts Meeting on Global Financial Integration, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of finance,
foreign affairs and development cooperation from more than a dozen
countries met here on Saturday under the auspices of the United
Nations Economic and Social Council(ECOSOC) on global financial
integration and development.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, initiated by the United Nations General Assembly
to strengthen ECOSOC, is aimed to assess the impact of global
financial integration and to discuss ways of promoting financial
stability. This meeting is considered particularly timely in light
of recent financial disturbances in East Asia.
</P>
<P>
The theme of "global financial integration and development"
involves the strong increase in private international financial
flows to developing countries during the last years and the
proliferation in agents, types and modes of such flows, that has
brought about an unprecedented degree of financial international
interdependence.
</P>
<P>
The experience of East Asia is significant in this context
because it shows the positive contribution of financial
globalization to the development, and at the same time the risks
and challenges that it poses.
</P>
<P>
The Secretariat of UN has suggested some issues to the themes
which will be addressed in discussion. These include:
</P>
<P>
-- The national economic and financial environment: the
existence of sound macroeconomic conditions and a sound domestic
financial sector are conducive to international financial flows
and reduce the threat of financial crises.
</P>
<P>
-- Multilateral mechanisms that could monitor all national
economic policies affecting international capital flows and
regulatory arrangement to strengthen competition and the
discipline of the market on the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
-- Arrangements for the equitable sharing of the costs of
resolving financial crises.
</P>
<P>
-- ways to manage financial crises without overlooking
longer-term priorities.
</P>
<P>
At an advance press conference Thursday, ECOSOC said
participants would have a free discussion on the issues mentioned
above and no statement or conclusion is expected by the end of the
meeting.

<HEADLINE> Legislation Must Reflect Views of Masses, Says NPC Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, said recently
that legislation must conform to China's reform and development
and reflect the views of the masses.
</P>
<P>
"Legislation must adhere to the mass line and must be solidly
based on investigations and studies which emphasize the
cooperation between legislators, law practitioners and
theorists," according to Li.
</P>
<P>
The NPC chairman made the remarks during a recent inspect in
east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the process of soliciting opinions concerning the
formulation of laws also represents a process to the general
public's awareness on related issues.
</P>
<P>
"Building socialism with Chinese characteristics is a new cause
which demands exploration and summarization," said Li Peng, who
is also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Legislation is the primary task of the Ninth NPC and its
Standing Committee, said Li. A legal framework based on the
Constitution and socialism with Chinese characteristics has taken
shape since the initiation of the country's reform and opening
effort.
</P>
<P>
The Ninth NPC will strive to establish a socialist legal system
with Chinese characteristics by the year 2010, said Li, adding
that "we face a heavy and arduous task in terms of legislation."
</P>
<P>
Li visited Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang Province, and
solicited opinions and suggestions from representatives from local
universities and colleges concerning the drafting of the Law on
Higher Education.
</P>
<P>
He said that competitions between countries in the 21st century
will focus on the competition related to comprehensive national
strength. The new law will be of great significance to carrying
out the program to revitalize the nation by using science and
education.
</P>
<P>
Li said the central government will continue to practice
overall management and will grant institutions of higher learning
more decision-making on their own affairs, while at the same time
encouraging nongovernmental social sectors to run schools.
</P>
<P>
Li also completed studies related to revisions of the Law on
Land Management, and expressed satisfaction with the province's
efforts in protecting arable land and wasteland reclamation.
</P>
<P>
The law, adopted in 1987, has played an important role in
protecting and developing land resources. However, new issues
concerning land management emerging in recent years require
improvements and revisions.
</P>
<P>
"We must refrain from seeking immediate and temporary economic
gains which will harm arable land resources needed for future
generations," said Li.
</P>
<P>
Li visited a number of township enterprises in suburban
Hangzhou and noted that Zhejiang is one of the pioneers in
township industrial development in China and have maintained
excellent momentum in recent years.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that township enterprises face fierce
competition in both domestic and international markets.
</P>
<P>
"Competition represents both a test and opportunities for
development," said Li, adding that the enterprises should achieve
sound growth by introducing structural readjustments,
technological upgrades and improving product quality.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng urged provincial officials to do a good job in
reforming state-owned enterprises, government institutions and the
local financial system.

<P>
COLOMBO, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States Saturday called
on  the Sri Lanka's Tamil rebels to lay down their arms and join
a peace process initiated by the Sri Lankan government to end the
15-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, visiting U.S. Ambassador
to the United Nations Bill Richardson said the U.S. was willing to
help the peace process but parties to the conflict must take the
initiative.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has declared the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE) as a "terrorist organization." The Ambassador said the LTTE
rebels must realize that the violence will not resolve the
drawn-out conflict in the country.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have been waging a war against the government
for a separate Tamil state in the north and east of the country
since 1983.
</P>
<P>
Richardson who arrived in Colombo Saturday after visiting
India, Pakistan and Afghanistan, will leave here tonight for
Bangkok.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Tobacco Sales Decrease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean Tobacco
Association (ZTA) said since the beginning of the marketing
season on March 31, over 7.3 million kgs of tobacco at an average
1.33 U.S. Dollars per kg had been sold by end of the week, 10
million kgs less than the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
ZTA Market Information Director Pat Davis Saturday told the
Zimbabwe News Agency that despite the devaluation of local
currency this year, prices remained low and farmers were
withholding their crop until prices firm later in the season.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The main reason for such a drop in sales is because
a lot of growers have canceled bookings or rejecting some of the
prices."
</P>
<P>
He said since the beginning of the marketing season on March
31, there had not been much improvement and competition was still
on the weak side while offerings tended to be on lower quality.
</P>
<P>
During the first 12 sale days of last year, prices averaged
2.07 U.S. Dollars per kg, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco is the country's biggest foreign currency earner. A
total of about 220 million kgs was expected to be sold this year
earning the country over 500 million U.S. Dollars.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi FM: Time Ripe for Lifting Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed
Saeed al-Sahhaf Saturday called for a lifting of sanctions against
Iraq after its compliance with U.N. resolutions, the Middle East
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi top diplomat made the appeal after talks with
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa on the developments of the
Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers exchanged views on the importance of
working at regional and international levels to for the lifting of
sanctions imposed since Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
To justify Iraq's demand for their early removal, al-Sahhaf
said his country has honored all obligations and executed all
relevant United Nations resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"Time is ripe to alleviate sufferings of the Iraqi people,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf arrived in Cairo Friday as a special envoy of Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein for talks with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
He met Mubarak earlier Saturday and conveyed a verbal message
from Saddam on progress made within the framework of a U.N.-Iraqi
deal cut in February to facilitate U.N. weapons inspections in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, a group of U.N. inspectors and senior diplomats
has inspected in March eight Iraqi presidential sites suspected of
hiding secretive weapon programs, but found nothing of this
sort. The Iraqi side was said to be cooperative during the
inspections.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf will travel on later Saturday to New York where he
will watch closely the half-yearly review within the U.N. Security
Council of a report submitted by the U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM) overseeing the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi ruling Revolution Command Council on Thursday
demanded the U.N. Security Council begin proceedings for the
lifting of sanctions it takes up the issue later this month.
</P>
<P>
The seven-year-old crippling U.N. sanctions against Iraq can
only be lifted after the UNSCOM certifies that Baghdad has
scrapped all prohibited weapons.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad said it has met all the demands, but a recent report by
the U.N. arms inspectors said Iraq had not fully accounted for
such weapons.

<HEADLINE> Thai PM Stresses to Alleviate Social Impact of Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
said Saturday afternoon that his government will find ways to
mitigate the social impact of the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
At the 52th annual congress of the ruling Democrat Party, Chuan
said the government will not neglect unemployment, poverty and
other social problems when tackling economic woes.
</P>
<P>
The government has taken measures to alleviate the liquidity
crunch of local enterprises and promote exports, which are all
conducive to the mitigation of social problems, Chuan said at the
one-day congress.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund has predicted that the number
of jobless people in Thailand could reach 2 million by the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
In view of this, Chuan said that a committee headed by himself
was set up to alleviate the mounting pressure of unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Chuan recalled the situation when his government took office
last November, saying his cabinet was confronted with the most
serious economic downturn in Thai history.
</P>
<P>
Five months later, confidence has been partly rebuilt on the
Thai economy when the baht returned from fluctuation to stability
and the capital inflows overwhelmed the outflows, the Prime
Minister, who is the leader of Democrat Party, noted.
</P>
<P>
Though a long and hard way ahead, Chuan said he is confident
that the government will solve problems both economic and social.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from across the country took part in Saturday's
congress.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1946, the Democrat Party is the oldest political
party in Thailand and the second largest party at present with 123
seats in the National Assembly. It is also the core party of the
ruling coalition.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean President Calls for National Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe Saturday urged the nation to be united with a common
vision and purpose as it moves towards the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
He made the call while addressing thousands of people who
crowed the National Sports Stadium here to mark the 18th
anniversary of Zimbabwe's independence from Britain.
</P>
<P>
"We should all pull together in one direction with a shared
vision, a unity of purpose and common values of patriotism,
selflessness and hard work," he said.
</P>
<P>
He deplored violence, saying only through unity could the
aspirations of the Zimbabwean people be attained.
</P>
<P>
"Whereas it is a democratic right for aggrieved persons to
peacefully demonstrate, the tendency towards a culture of violent
demonstrations and lawlessness must stop, must stop, must stop,"
Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
He assured the Zimbabweans that the government would not allow
a situation of anarchy to develop.
</P>
<P>
On the national economy, he said that the country's economy
had over the years experienced some rather sharp shocks, notably
the depreciation of the Zimbabwean Dollar by 20 percent as at the
end of December 1997, the high price rises and the galloping
inflation causing in turn a push-up of interest rates.
</P>
<P>
At the same time high consumer prices had the effect of
reducing real wages quite drastically.
</P>
<P>
As a result, he said, the government was compelled by the
ensuing circumstances to resort to several measures to encounter
the adverse effects on economy.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the GDP growth rate declined to 3.7 percent from 8.1
percent realized in 1996, and economic performance is expected to
further slow down this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Turning to sectoral performance, Mugabe said that the 1996/97
agricultural season had recorded a growth rate of 21.4 percent,
but prospects for 1997/98 production indicate that the sector
can't, because of erratic rains, perform as last year.
</P>
<P>
In the education and health sectors, he said, commissions of
enquiry had been put in place to review their operations which
had been facing various problems.
</P>
<P>
This year's celebrations were characterized by the traditional
lighting of the independence flame, mass displays, parachute
displays and police displays.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Stock Market Turnover Rises by 46.9 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The turnover at Jordan's stock
market in the past trading week amounted to 4.7 million Jordanian
dinars (about 6.63 million U.S. dollars), the Jordan Times
newspaper reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the weekly bulletin of the Amman Financial
Market as saying that the total turnover from April 11 to 15
witnessed a rise of 46.9 percent from that in the trading week
from April 4 to 5.
</P>
<P>
The increase was made possible due to the publication of good
achievements in 1997 of several major industrial companies and
their announcement to distribute dividends to the shareholders,
according to the semi-official newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The turnover rise last week was also owed to a normal trading
week compared with the previous one, which was cut short to two
trading days due to Muslim holidays.
</P>
<P>
But as the average daily turnover is concerned, it is lower
last week, whose amount stood at 940,000 dinars (about 1.33
million dollars) compared to 1.6 million dinars (2.26 million
dollars) in the previous week.
</P>
<P>
The industrial sector got lion's share in last week's trading
of up to 42.1 percent while the service sector ranked the second
with a share of 28.2 percent, according to the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Volunteers Demolish the "Great Wall of Garbage" (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, April 18 (Xinhua) -- A garbage invasion to the Great
Wall of China met a major counter-attack by a multi-national joint
force today at the Wall's Jinshanling section.
</P>
<P>
The 120-strong army consisted of volunteers from about 20
countries including China, Britain, the United States and
Bangladesh, each armed with a pair of cotton gloves and a huge
plastic trash bag.
</P>
<P>
Beijing urbanites, foreign experts, and tourists picked up and
bagged away over half a ton of food wraps, beer bottles, coke
cans, film boxes and all kinds of paper on and off the
Jinshanling, one of the most-visited section of the Wall at the
border of Beijing and Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
Litterings, no less severe than in other tourist spots of
China, forms two parallel walls of garbage along the fractions of
the Great Wall opened to tourists, hence tarnishing its look.
</P>
<P>
It also astonished William Lindesay, a British expert who has
built a career as Great Wall adventurist and researcher in
Beijing. He called up today's campaign helped by five-star Great
Wall Sheraton Hotel and named it "I cleaned the Great Wall."
</P>
<P>
"The idea came when my friends suggested me not to mention in
my book many wild and clean parts of the Wall I have visited, in
fear of that the publicity would attract people there to spoil
them," Lindesay says. "This makes me be aware how serious the
situation is."
</P>
<P>
Braving thorny bushes and foot skids, a quick-handed Chinese
student from Qinghua University easily filled his huge plastic bag
in less than 20 minutes. The 19-year-old Hu Jingnan rubbed a
scratch on the arm and said, "The littering is worse than I
thought, we should really think of some means to stop people doing
that."

<TEXT>
<P>
The volunteers' work at least forestalled today any littering
at Jinshanling, where tourists were happy to dump their picnic
disposals directly into a passing volunteer's black plastic
bag. "I think the problem is that you don't see trash bins around
here," one complained.
</P>
<P>
"Bring it home," is the solution suggested by
environment-conscious persons.
</P>
<P>
Graeme Allen from Sheraton Hotel was keen to notice that the
Wall itself was clean, but garbage was all around off the its two
sides. "People has respect for the Wall, but don't care about
environment," he rationalized.
</P>
<P>
Volunteers' assault to garbage lasted for three hours in the
mid-day sunlight. The organizer William Lindesay refrained from a
sigh of relief at the end, "It's much cleaner, but we have made
only a tiny impression on a major problem."
</P>
<P>
All the foreigners in the group were anxious to show they
weren't trying to teach the owner of the Great Wall how to take
care of it. Spotting 20 elite-brand champagne bottles excited
them. Priced nearly an equivalent of 100 U.S. dollars in local
market, the bubbling wine was clearly not consumed by Chinese.
</P>
<P>
"The Great Wall is a pride of all people in the world, not only
the Chinese," said Salie Beaumont from Britain. "Everybody should
learn to protect it."
</P>
<P>
When the group were posing for triumphant photo-takings before a
three-hour bus ride back to Beijing, the general manager of
Jinshanling Park showed up in grey suit. He looked thankful, and
nodded vehemently at William Lindesay's suggestion of printing
some love-the-environment notice on the admission tickets he sells
to the 100,000 visitors coming every year.

bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
At the first of two "no-necktie" talks at Japan's seaside
resort of Kawana, about 130 kilometers southwest of Tokyo, the two
leaders agreed on reciprocal visits by Hashimoto to Moscow this
fall and by Yeltsin to Tokyo next year.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who arrived earlier in the day at Tokyo's Haneda
airport and immediately flew by helicopter to Kawana, was quoted
as telling Hashimoto that he wants to promote ties on both the
economic and political fronts through a series of vigorous
political exchanges.
</P>
<P>
During the 90-minute talks, the two leaders reviewed economic
cooperation called for under the so-called "Hashimoto-Yeltsin
Plan" adopted last November at their previous informal summit in
Krasnoyarsk, eastern Siberia.
</P>
<P>
With the aim of giving further momentum to the plan, Hashimoto
told Yeltsin that Japan will disburse 600 million U.S. dollars in
untied loans through the Export-Import Bank of Japan to help
Russia develop natural resources.
</P>
<P>
This is part of a 1.5 billion dollar credit line Japan offered
to Moscow in February for resources development over the next two
years.
</P>
<P>
Both sides also agreed that Japan and Russia will cooperate in
combating global warming by jointly attaining the targets on
carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions set at last December's United
Nations climate conference in Kyoto.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders, however, left the main task of their talks --
resolving a territorial row so that a treaty to formally their
Second World War hostilities can be signed by 2000 -- to Sunday's
second round of talks.
</P>
<P>
In Saturday's talks, Yeltsin proposed that Moscow and Tokyo
jointly build facilities for processing marine products and needed
infrastructure such as roads and ports on a chain of disputed
islands off Japan's northernmost main island of Hokkaido.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto, obviously aware that Japan's acceptance of the
proposal could give Moscow an advantage in negotiations for a
peace treaty, replied that Tokyo wants to "consider" the proposal
"in parallel with negotiations for a peace treaty."
</P>
<P>
The dispute over ownership of the four Russian-held islands --
Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan and the Habomai group -- has
prevented Japan and Russia from signing a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
At their informal summit last November in the eastern Siberian
city of Krasnoyarsk, Hashimoto and Yeltsin agreed that they would
strive to conclude a peace treaty by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's visit, which was originally scheduled for April 11-13
and delayed one week due to Russia's domestic political
uncertainty, is his first since 1993 when he made an official
visit to Tokyo.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Assists Laid-off Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Yan Changcheng, a laid-off
Beijinger unable to find a job for some two years, will go to work
at the Beijing Union Medical College Hospital on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Yan is amongst the first group of people benefitting from the
first employment assistance program initiated today by the local
government.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government has formulated the program to provide
assistance for an estimated 190,000 laid-off workers. The program,
the first of its kind in the nation, offers free services to help
people find new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Yan, 35, who formerly worked for the Beijing Electrical
Machinery Plant, will earn 500 yuan (60 US dollars) per month for
working in the hospital's laundry department.
</P>
<P>
"The opportunity is precious and I will do my best at the new
job." said Yan.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Labor Bureau joined 18 district branches in
organizing a recent employment fair which attracted the interest
of over 34,000 laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
However, some laid-off workers prefer to accept 200 yuan
bottom-line monthly relief from the government rather than accept
what they consider to be demeaning jobs.
</P>
<P>
The bureau plans to organize another large-scale employment
assistance program later this year, in addition to offering grass
roots employment information services for workers, according to
Labor Bureau Director You Lantian.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities will create at least 190,000 job
opportunities for laid-off workers, according to You.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Speaker New Gingrich of the House of Representatives said
that the tobacco bill proposed by his fellow Republican, Senator
John McCain of Arizona, was too liberal and had virtually no
chance of passage in the House. Mr. McCain said that he would not
consider dropping his bill, especially in light of its recent
approval by the Senate Commerce Committee, of which he is
chairman, by a vote of 19 to 1.
</P>
<P>
-- Supporters of an effort to revive a campaign finance bill in
the House said they needed 17 more representatives to sign a
special discharge petition and meet the requirement for 218
signatures. The petition, a rarely used House procedural device,
would force debate and votes on several bills to overhaul the
nation's campaign finance laws, including measures that Republican
leaders kept off the House floor three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The space shuttle Columbia, carrying seven astronauts and a
menagerie of lab rats, fish, crickets and snails, thundered into
orbit Friday on a complex 16-day mission to probe the mysteries of
the brain and nervous system.
</P>
<P>
-- Amid mounting criticism of Senator John McCain's tobacco
proposal, the House Republicans leadership is considering a wholly
different alternative that would fold an anti-teenage smoking
initiative into a broader anti-smoking package.

<HEADLINE> Iran Hails Taliban's Readiness to Cease Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Iran Saturday voiced welcome to
the readiness of the Afghan Taliban group to cease fire, calling
it a "positive" step to restore peace in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
If the Taliban group accepts a cease-fire and holds talks
with the Northern Alliance, "it will be a positive change" in
Afghanistan, Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi
said.
</P>
<P>
During a recent visit to Kabul by the United States Ambassador
to the U.N. Bill Richardson, the Taliban group promised to cease
fire by April 27.
</P>
<P>
According to Richardson, the Afghan Northern Alliance has also
agreed to a truce and hold talks with the Taliban group before
April 27.
</P>
<P>
Iran has been calling for a cease-fire and talks among the
Afghan groups, the spokesman said, reiterating Tehran's readiness
to help solve the Afghan crisis under the sponsorship of the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Along with Richardson's mission, the U.N. special envoy for
Afghanistan Lakhdar Brahimi stepped up his efforts to help end the
war in the country through talks with leaders of Afghan neighbors.
</P>
<P>
During his visit here, Brahimi called on Iranian leaders to
make more efforts to coordinate with the U.N., the Organization of
the Islamic Conference and regional countries to seek ways of
restoring peace in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Islamic Taliban regime came to power after its armed
forces captured the capital of Kabul in September, 1996. It drove
out the government troops led by President Burhanuddin Rabbani,
leader the alliance of Guerrillas who stormed into the capital in
1992 after years of war with then Soviet-backed regime.
</P>
<P>
Ever since, a new civil war has been continuing between the
Taliban forces, which control most parts of the country, and the
guerrilla alliance which occupies the north.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Iran's special envoy for Afghan
affairs Alaeddin Boroujerdi is currently visiting Moscow to
coordinate with Russian officials on the efforts by the U.N. and
the U.S. over the Afghan issue.

<HEADLINE> Assistance to HK Fish Farmers To Be Discussed at PLC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 18 (Xinhua) -- A special meeting of the
Finance Committee of the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC)
will be held next Thursday to consider government proposals for
providing financial assistance to fish farmers affected by the
recent red tides.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Economic Services Bureau said here today
that the proposals included an injection of 200 million HK dollars
(25.6 million U.S. dollars) into the Kadoorie Agricultural Aid
Loan Fund and an injection of 17 million HK dollars (2.2 million
U.S. dollars) into the Emergency Relief Fund.
</P>
<P>
The injection into these two funds is required so that they
would have sufficient capital to meet the needs of all farmers
affected, he said.
</P>
<P>
Fish farmers can apply under the Kadoorie Agricultural Aid Loan
Fund for low-interest loans. The size of the loan in any
individual case depends on factors such as the cost of fish fry
and the duration in raising the fish to marketable size, said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposals, the loan amount will not exceed 500,000 HK
dollars (64,100 U.S. dollars), of which up to 100,000 HK dollars
(12,820 U.S. dollars) may be granted on an unsecured basis. The
interest rate on the loans will be 2 percent and repayment need
not commence until 18 months after the loan is drawn.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that the mariculture operators were also
eligible under the Emergency Relief Fund for grants of up to
11,250 HK dollars (1,442 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Most of Hong Kong fishing zones were affected by the red tides,
a build-up of algae, earlier this month, and preliminary estimates
put losses at over 80 million HK dollars (10.3 million U.S.
dollars).

<HEADLINE> Capital Iron and Steel Co. Exports Plate Steel to Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The Capital Iron and Steel
Corporation recently exported 14,000 tons of medium and thick
gauge plate steel to France, Germany and various other major
European markets.
</P>
<P>
The recent plate steel exports were the first for the
Beijing-bases corporation, according to a company executive, who
noted that the company's traditional market was in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
However, the shrinking market in Southeast Asia forced the
company to target its business promotions in European countries
which have a large demand for various gauges of plate steel. The
company is currently fulfilling orders for six European countries,
according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the company's exports of construction-use steel
products is still inadequate. The International Trade and
Engineering Company, a subsidiary of the Capital Iron and Steel
Corporation, is extending great efforts to make the best use of
adjustments in relevant state policies to expand the scope of
imports and exports of general commodities and technical products.
</P>
<P>
The company's promotions and sales departments have introduced
wide-ranging products, including steel, metallurgical spare parts
and electromechanical products, as well as daily-use items to
businessmen from nations throughout the world. Related efforts
increased the corporation's exports of sideline products by 60
percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The corporation recorded a 1997 export sales volume of 1.5
billion yuan, with annual profits standing at 200 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Contracted projects in foreign countries have emerged into an
important component of overseas business, said one corporation
executive, adding the corporation has contracted overseas projects
valued at 100 million U.S. dollars, including a contract for
upgrading a blast furnace in Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Russian Duma Refuses Kiriyenko Second Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Russian government crisis
deepened when the State Duma (lower house of parliament) failed to
approve Sergei Kiriyenko as prime minister for the second time.
</P>
<P>
On Friday the Duma deputies turned down the president's nominee
with 115 voting for, 271 against and 11 abstentions. The result
was worse for Kiriyenko than the first vote on April 10 when 143
voted for and 186 against in a secret ballot.
</P>
<P>
Under Russia's constitution, the premier's candicacy needs at
least 226 votes in the 450-seat Duma to be confirmed. If the
nomination is rejected a third time, the president has the right
to dissolve the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, as he had vowed, immediately resubmitted Kiriyenko's
name for a third vote expected to be held on April 24.
</P>
<P>
The president, who left Friday night for an informal summit
with Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto in Kawana, Japan,
appeared to be "calm," confidently believing that Kiriyenko would
be approved by the Duma in the end.
</P>
<P>
"We expect the third vote to bring about the result the country
needs -- an approval of Kiriyenko's nomination," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party, which dominates the Duma with 135 seats,
pressed successfully for a roll-call vote in the second try on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov announced Wednesday that all
the Communist deputies in parliament's lower house were bound by
party discipline to oppose Kiriyenko when his nomination came up
on the second attempt on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In the ballot, 121 Communist deputies voted against and only
two for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
However, the Communists appeared to be divided before the
second vote when house speaker Gennady Seleznyov, a member of the
Communist Party group, called for the approval of Kiriyenko as
premier, saying that he would fight to preserve the State Duma.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government's crisis began on March 23, when Yeltsin
sacked former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and the whole
government, and chose 35-year-old Kiriyenko, the Fuel and Energy
Minister as acting prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition argument against 35-year-old Kiriyenko is
that he is too young and inexperienced. Formerly a little-known
local banker, he has less than a year's experience in government.

<HEADLINE> New Nepali Govt Wins Confidence of Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The three-member new government
of Nepal led by Girija Prasad Koirala obtained a vote of
confidence Saturday afternoon with a comfortable majority in the
Lower House of parliament.
</P>
<P>
The government garnered 144 votes in the 205-seat Lower House,
41 more than needed to win a vote of confidence, as the main
opposition Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxism-Leninism,
CPN-UML) and the newly-formed National Democratic Party (RPP) both
threw their weight behind Koirala as they had promised.
</P>
<P>
Four MPs from two small parties voted against, while those from
other parties including the RPP led by former prime minister Surya
Bahadur Thapa abstained.
</P>
<P>
The government took office on Wednesday, comprising only Prime
Minister Koirala, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Water
Resources Miss Shailaja Acharya and Finance Minister Ram Saran
Mahat.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali Congress, the largest party in the House with 87
MPs, has decided to form a minority government after failing to
find a ruling partner.
</P>
<P>
Under the constitution, any coalition or minority government
must obtain a vote of confidence in the Lower House within 30 days
to remain in office. And if it fails, parliament must be dissolved
for fresh polls.
</P>
<P>
Observers said that the CPN-UML and New RPP have offered
support to the minority government led by the NC because they do
not want new elections under the present conditions.
</P>
<P>
They will be at a disadvantage as the government remains in
power for six months even after the fresh polls are called.
</P>
<P>
Koirala has decided to expand the cabinet after winning the
vote of confidence.
</P>
<P>
Surya Bahadur Thapa resigned on April 10 under a power-sharing
agreement he reached with the NC, one of his ruling partners.

<HEADLINE> HK To Adopt New Measures To tackle Unemployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government will
launch a number of new initiatives to help the unemployed re-enter
the labor market.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the meeting of the Inter-bureau and departmental
Working Group on employment Friday, Joseph W P Wong, secretary
for Education and Manpower, said: "we will soon be launching two
new initiatives to help the unemployed."
</P>
<P>
Firstly, he said that the Employees Retraining Board will be
running special tailor-made on-the-job retraining programs for
employers on top of its existing courses.
</P>
<P>
The primary objective of such training programs is to equip the
unemployed trainees with new and transferable skills which will
enable them to secure a job, hold down their jobs in the labor
market and upgrade their skills in the longer term.
</P>
<P>
The second initiative is that the Vocational Training Council
will be launching a Business Starter program targeted at middle
managers who become unemployed and wish to explore the option of
starting their own business.
</P>
<P>
The program aims at providing potential owner-managers with the
knowledge and skills to evaluate their business plans, conduct
feasibility studies and set up new business in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Wong said the government has been implementing a
series of measures in conjunction with the Hong Kong Tourist
Association (HKTA) to enhance the competitiveness of its tourist
industry.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the HKTA is launching a large-scale new promotion
campaign, costing 173 million HK dollars (22 million
U.S. dollars), to promote Hong Kong in the international tourist
market so as to create more employment chances for the employed.
</P>
<P>
Wong said that the economic fundamentals of Hong Kong remain
strong and employment prospects still very positive in the medium
to long term.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to work closely with employers, employees and
training bodies to monitor the effectiveness of the measures and
to explore even better measures," Wong emphasized.

<HEADLINE> Thai Hotels Adjust Policies for Low Arrivals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Major Bangkok hotels, suffering
from a significant drop in Japanese arrivals in the first quarter,
have to review policies with a shift of focus to individual
travelers.
</P>
<P>
The shift would compensate for the decline in the number of
group and family visitors, said Masao Wakuta, general manager of
Nikko Mahanakorn Bangkok, a five-star hotel.
</P>
<P>
A TV report on Saturday quoted Masao as saying that the
first-quarter arrivals were at least 15 percent less than in the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
In the past 12 months, overall Japanese arrivals dropped 20
percent, as a result of the region's economic turmoil, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
A number of hotels such as Nikko Mahanakorn, Shangri-La, Regent
and Hotel Sunroute have begun adjusting their market strategies,
putting into effect additional promotion campaigns and greater use
of direct marketing. They would also have to create more
diversified travel packages to lure visitors.
</P>
<P>
The packages would include inbound round-trip tickets which
were expected to draw some individual travelers from Japan, as
they are more flexible in their travel and normally wound not
limit their stay in one particular place, Wakuta said.
</P>
<P>
He said hotels would have to maintain their service levels,
along with value-added quality to sustain a longer stay, as well
as induce return visits.
</P>
<P>
A further decline in Japanese arrivals in Thailand was expected
to continue from this second quarter until early October,
according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Blair Pledges Support to Egypt in Fighting Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 18 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said Saturday Britain would soon introduce stronger anti-terrorism
laws and will stand by Egypt in fighting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Blair, who arrived here Friday afternoon, told the
British-Egyptian Business Association (BEBA) over a working
breakfast that Britain, the current chairman of the European
Union, will continue to promote "a just and sustainable settlement
of the Arab-Israeli dispute."
</P>
<P>
Blair, extending his condolences and sympathy for the families
of those murdered by terrorists in Luxor last November, said "This
tragic and horrific attack was carried out by terrorists trying to
strike a blow against the Egyptian government."
</P>
<P>
Altogether 58 foreign tourists, including six Britons, were
massacred in the southern Egyptian archeological city by six
Muslim militants, in the most violent attack of a six-year
insurgency against Egypt's secular government.
</P>
<P>
"I told President (Hosni) Mubarak that Britain stands shoulder
to shoulder with Egypt in its determination to fight terrorism
from wherever it comes. Britain will not be a safe haven for
terrorists. We will bring forward proposals soon for stronger
counter-terrorism laws in the U.K.," said Blair.
</P>
<P>
The British prime minister held 150-minute talks with Mubarak
Friday evening with focus on the European role to break the
year-long deadlock in the Mideast peace process. Both leaders
warned of grave consequences of the peace drive failed to move
forward.
</P>
<P>
Turning to economics, Blair said he shared with Mubarak an
important conviction that sability and the prospects for peace are
inextricably linked to a prosperous and economically open Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
"People, both Arab and Israeli, need to realize that by working
together in the economic sphere -- trading, investing in each
other's companies -- they will not only be better off, but will
also help bring about a long term peace," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have been frozen since
march 1997. The EU, the largest donor country to the Palestinians,
hopes to propel its political influence in the region.
</P>
<P>
Also on Saturday morning, Blair and Egyptian Prime Minister
Kamal el-Ganzouri co-launched the BEBA Council to promote
cooperation between private sectors of the two countries with the
support of their governments.
</P>
<P>
The occasion was attended by around 200 diplomats and business
leaders of the two countries, including Egyptian Minister of
Public Enterprise Atef Obeid and Presidential Advisor Osama el-Baz.
</P>
<P>
With annual trade volume topping 1 billion U.S. dollars,
Britain is Egypt's fourth largest trade partner in Europe after
Italy, France and Germany.
</P>
<P>
U.K. is also Egypt's largest direct investor with 1 billion
sterling pounds (1.67 billion dollars) annually and second largest
indirect stock market investor after the U.S., according to
Ganzouri, who described his business-smart British counterpart as
a "commercial politician."
</P>
<P>
Before winding up his two-day visit in Cairo Saturday
afternoon, Blair and Egyptian Minister of Oil Hamdi Banbi will
attend the signing ceremony of a contract granting British Gas
Company for supplying the Southern Valley with natural gas.
</P>
<P>
Blair will visit Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Israel and the
Palestinian National Authority on his maiden five-day tour of the
Middle East.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Gets Message From Saddam on Arms Inspection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
received Saturday a message from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on
the progress made within the agreement between Iraq and the United
Nations on arms inspection.
</P>
<P>
The message was conveyed by Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed
Saeed Al-Sahhaf who arrived here Friday for talks with Mubarak and
Arab League Secretary General Esmat Abdel-Meguid.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from his meeting with the Egyptian leader Saturday
morning, Sahhaf said that he came to Egypt as Saddam's special
envoy to convey a verbal message to Mubarak, focusing on the
February memo of understanding struck by Baghdad and the U.N.
</P>
<P>
"The message also centered on the result achieved so far and
the steps expected to be taken in the near future," Sahaf said,
adding that he received a "full-fledged" response to the message
from Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa together with Iraqi
delegation to the Arab League Nabil Nejm attended the talks.
</P>
<P>
During the recent Iraqi-U.N. standoff on arms inspection of
Iraqi presidential sites, Sahaf visited Egypt in February within a
tour of a number of Arab countries to hand over messages to their
leaders from Saddam.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister later Saturday will travel on to New York
where he will watch closely the half-yearly review within the
U.N. Security Council of a report submitted by the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) overseeing the elimination of Iraq's weapons
of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Sahhaf will meet representatives of some members of the
Security Council to discuss the latest development in Iraq's
relationship with the U.N..
</P>
<P>
The seven-year-old crippling U.N. sanctions against Iraq can
only be lifted after the UNSCOM certifies that Baghdad has scrapped
all prohibited weapons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, New York times quoted Friday UNSCOM chief inspector
Richard Butler as warning that Iraq has not yet inched towards
meeting the conditions required for lifting U.N. sanctions imposed
since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
After a six-month standoff with Iraq, the U.N. inspectors,
accompanied by veteran diplomats from the U.N. Security Council
member states, inspected in March eight Iraqi presidential sites
which Iraq had previously declared off-limits.

PHNOM PENH, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Deposed First Prime Minister

Saturday.

relations with the Khmer Rouge, nor have his troops had any
military links or cooperation with them.

In March, King Sihanouk requested his son to give back the
"autonomous zone" controlled by the forces loyal to him. He also
proposed to the Hun Sen government to reintegrate those troops
into one royal forces.
</P>

Ranariddh favored the proposal but denied that he had any
autonomous zones.

<HEADLINE> Work on 2nd Line Station of Guangzhou Subway to Start in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou, capital of south
China's Guangdong Province, will start building an key station on
the second line of the city's subway network in July.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou Subway Corporation will start a bidding for the
project beginning from April 20 for the construction of the Haizhu
Square Station, and the project will cover a 2,311-meter section
on an experiment basis that runs through beneath the Pearl River.
</P>
<P>
The project is considered the most difficult undertaking in
terms of technology in the entire second subway line construction,
according to Wang Wenbin, deputy general manager of the company.
</P>
<P>
For the first-phase construction, the north-south second subway
line will be 21.34 km long, and half of it will use light rails,
costing about 10 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Workers will have to build one car-exchange center, 19
stations, including nine stations and ten flyover stations for the
projected subway line.
</P>
<P>
The second subway line will join the first soon after it ends
in traversing beneath the Pearl River.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary plan calls for completion and operation of the
second subway line in 2000, and passenger volume will amount to
32,800 per hour during rush hours in the early months of the
subway operations.
</P>
<P>
The experimental section, which is still waiting for a
governmental approval, will take three years to complete and will
cost 640 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The city's first 18.5-km subway line is still under
construction and is expected to be fully completed in July this
year. A 5.4-km section of the line went on trial operation last
June and construction of its 11 stations has been going on
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
The first subway line was started in December 1993, and it is
expected to cost 13.8 billion yuan. Most of the equipment used in
the metro subway network was imported and funds came from the
German, US, British, and Japanese governments. Part of the cost
was covered by loans from international banks or raised through
real estate deals in areas along the subway line.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou is now China's fourth city with a subway network,
after Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin.

<HEADLINE> S. African Airways to Modify All Its Boeing 737s </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 18 (Xinhua) -- South African Airways (SAA)
will comply with a United States Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA) directive that all Boeing 737s be rewired to prevent
potential short circuits that could spark fuel-tank explosions.
</P>
<P>
Local daily Saturday Star quoted SAA public relations officer
Jackie Rakitla as saying that the corporation's 11 aircraft would
be rewired as soon as it received communication from the FAA.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the FAA directive especially recommended
better insulation for all wires and that low-voltage and
high-voltage wires that are currently bundled together be rewired
sparately to prevent arcs between them.
</P>
<P>
It also called for more fire avoidance systems and recommended
that new pressure-reducing valves be installed in ventilation
systems for fuel tanks and ducts to stop fires from spreading.
</P>
<P>
The modification will cost an estimated 180,000 Rand (36,000
U.S. Dollars) to rewire each plane and SAA might end up with a
two-million Rand (400,000 U.S. Dollars) bill for the
modification.
</P>
<P>
The FAA has allowed 12 months for airlines to implement the
modifications. Similar directives were issued in November last
year for Boeing 747-100s, 200s and 300s, the older version of the
jumbo jet, following the investigation into the cause of the July
1996 crash of TWA flight 800 off the coast of New York.

<HEADLINE> ICBC Beijing Branch to Issue Mortgage Loans for Individuals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) --The Beijing Branch of the
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) plans to issue 500
million yuan of loans this year to support individual residents to
buy their housing, China's leading newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The branch has also published measures on management of
guaranty loans to individual recently, which has set clear
definitions on such issues concerning the status of future loan
users, loan line, terms and forms of repayment, the "People's
Daily" said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of March, the branch had altogether issued to
individuals such guaranty loans totalling 87.31 million yuan and
had helped urban residents buy 555 apartments, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
China will stop distribution of government-subsidized housing
as a welfare form later this year, and residents will have to buy
their own apartments through market as the country's housing
reform continues to expand in depth.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that the People's Bank of China, the
central bank, will issue some 100 billion yuan of loans for
housing this year, in a bid to encourage individual residents to
purchase their own flats.
</P>
<P>
It is also encouraging all commercial banks to provide
long-term mortgage loans if necessary.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 58.7 percent of the housing sold from
January to November of 1997 went to individual buyers, an increase
of 27.7 percent over the same 1996 period.

<HEADLINE> Two More Philippine Natives Die of Food Poisoning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MANILA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Two more hungry Tiruray natives,
who resorted to eating "kayos," a wild root crop abundant in the
southern province of Maguindanao, recently died of food poisoning,
bringing the death toll to 14.
</P>
<P>
In a communique addressed to Health Secretary Carmencita
Reodica on Saturday, the Integrated Provincial Health Office
identified the latest fatalities as sisters Mercy and Lilet
Dalimbang, aged three and one, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The deaths of the Dalimbang kids came in the midst of
government efforts to distribute relief goods to poor families
heavily affected by the drought-induced El Nino phenomenon in
Maguindanao.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, the health office reported 12 others
natives, two from North Upi and ten from South Upi, who also died
from eating "kayos" in the province.
</P>
<P>
Maguindanao health chief Tahir Sulaik said the "kayos" was
found out to contain dioscorine, a substance proven fatal to
humans at a certain level.
</P>
<P>
Sulaik, who visited the adjoining towns of Upi earlier this
week together with health Undersecretary Antonio Lopez, has
recommended to Reodica to immediately send more relief items and
mobilize action teams in the area to address the problem.

PHNOM PENH, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The Cambodian government
Saturday urged the international organizations and friendly
countries to speed up their assistance for its general election to
avoid postponement.

obligations and creating all facilities for the National Electoral
Committee (NEC) to carry out their job of organizing the
parliamentary elections scheduled for July 26, 1998, said the
statement.

Without too much time left for the NEC to prepare for the
elections, the government would like to once again strongly urge
all the parties promising to provide aid for the elections to
speed up the delivery and disbursement of their assistance, the
statement added.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Opposition Lobby Group Drops Mass Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's main opposition group
National Convention Executive Council (NCEC) has withdrawn its
program of mass action to enable the constitutional review
process to take root in the country.
</P>
<P>
The group said Friday that it is committed to dialogue to
bring changes in the country and urged the government to take the
"olive branch".
</P>
<P>
"As an act of good faith, the NCEC has withdrawn the program
of mass action in Nairobi to give the unfolding work on
consensus building on constitution change," co-convener Kibutha
Kibwana said.
</P>
<P>
"We want to send a loud message to the country that the NCEC
will not obstruct a bona fide and genuine process of
constitutional reform," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mass action began with a planned nationwide strike on April 3,
which flopped after most Kenyans ignored it. Subsequent strikes
were designed to be staged on May 4 and 5, in June and July.
</P>
<P>
However, Kibwana said it was not the abortive strike that made
the lobby to withdraw the program.
</P>
<P>
The NCEC wishes to be included in the "facilitative"
Inter-Party parliamentary Committee meeting set for May 11, which
will draw up modalities on how a Constitutional Review
Commission will work, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that it will be unreasonable for them to seek
inclusion in the committee and at the same time mobilize Kenyans
for mass action.
</P>
<P>
"We want to build this country together. What is critical now
is for us to create an environment where everyone comes in...It
is logical for the government to include the NCEC and all
stakeholders in the level-one meeting," he added.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: No Winner in Possible Duma's Dissolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Russia will have to carry on
without a government for another week since the lower house State
Duma turned down President Boris Yeltsin's choice of Sergei
Kiriyenko as prime minister in the second vote Friday.
</P>
<P>
It is however too early to forecast a rupture between the
president and the parliament, which may trigger early elections
and political conflict.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko lost his second confirmation when 271 voted against
him, 85 more than that in the initial round. Consenting votes fell
from 143 to 115, with 11 abstentions at Friday's Duma ballot.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko won backing from the pro-government Our Home Is
Russia (NDR) and the Russia's Region blocs but was rebuffed by the
Communists, the Liberal Democratic Party and the Yabloko bloc.
</P>
<P>
Although Kiriyenko received an even less favorable result in
the second round, he still has got another but the last chance,
when Yeltsin renominated Kiriyenko for premiership immediately
after the voting. The third and final round of confirmation voting
is scheduled for next week.
</P>
<P>
Under the Russian constitution, Yeltsin must dissolve the State
Duma and call early elections if the lower house rejects the
president's prime minister nomination for a third time.
</P>
<P>
However, the dissolution of the Duma spells doom for Yeltsin's
plan of realizing social stability and economic revival. Yeltsin
moreover would be reluctant to call for early elections for fear
he might have to deal with even a tougher State Duma three months
later.
</P>
<P>
For the leftist-dominated Duma, early dissolution will disrupt
the strategic plans of all the political parties for the next
presidential elections. It also means many deputies will have to
leave the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Well aware that dissolving the present Duma could cost both
sides a high price, Yeltsin and the Duma are making harder
"bargains" before the "showdown" in the final vote.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has convened the opposition-proposed round-table meeting
and promised to solve the welfare problems of the deputy
members. Catering to the Duma's demand, the president also
announced he will not seek a third term of office in the next
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Yeltsin on Tuesday, the Duma's Communist
speaker Gennady Seleznyov called on the lower house to approve
Kiriyenko's nomination "so that the term of the incumbent Duma can
be fulfilled."
</P>
<P>
Perceived as a show of flexibility in the Duma, a handful of
leftist opposition members supported Kiriyenko's nomination in
both rounds. Two Communist deputies voted for Kiriyenko in
the second open voting, along with five deputies from Power
to People and four from Agrarian blocs.
</P>
<P>
The Duma speaker Seleznyov did not attend the ballot.
</P>
<P>
For all the bargaining surrounding the premier designate, it is
becoming increasingly obvious that all parties wish to readjust
their standings so as to avoid the dissolution of the Duma, which
would be the choice if they fail to work out a solution to the
wide gap between their demands.
</P>
<P>
As the final round of voting approaches, whether the political
forces are heading toward compromise or conflict remains to be
seen.

TOKYO, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
arrived here on Saturday for a two-day informal summit with
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto to promote broader
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
After arriving at Tokyo's Haneda airport, Yeltsin was
immediately whisked off to a helicopter which will take him to the
site for the summit, a resort villa in the town of Kawana,
Shizuoka Prefecture, about 130 kilometers southwest of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
At the Kawana seaside resort, Yeltsin and Hashimoto will spend
24 hours in a relaxed "no-neckties" mood, with two rounds of
summit talks scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Hashimoto will hold a first 90-minute round of
summit talks late Saturday afternoon to discuss ways to promote
bilateral ties in a wide range of fields.
</P>
<P>
The agenda at the informal summit will include a review of the
so-called Hashimoto-Yeltsin plan, adopted at last November's
informal summit talks in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk,
security dialogue and cultural exchange, Japanese government
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The focus of the summit talks will be how Hashimoto and Yeltsin
can move forward bilateral negotiations so that a peace treaty may
be signed by the year 2000, they said.
</P>
<P>
Japan and Russia have not signed a peace treaty due to the
decades-old dispute over the ownership of four Russian-held
islands off Japan's northernmost main island of Hokkaido.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto and Yeltsin are also expected to discuss how to form
a framework for four-party security dialogue among Japan, Russia,
China and the United States, government sources said.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Yeltsin and Hashimoto are scheduled to hold their
second round of summit talks.

<HEADLINE> Inter-Korean Talks Ends Fruitless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The first inter-Korean high-level
talks in four years ended here today after a week-long fruitless
negotiations, and no timetable is in sight for further talks.
</P>
<P>
The gap between the two sides remains unchanged: the North
wants the fertilizer aid first, while the South insists on that
the North fixes a date for talks on the issue of reunion of
separated families.
</P>
<P>
Chun Kum Chun, head delegate of the Democratic People's
Republic Korea (DPRK), told a press conference this morning that
the North wanted the fertilizer aid first to help relieve its
natural disasters, before coming to the reunion issue.
</P>
<P>
The South demanded too much, he said, adding "The South's
method is `we give you a bowl of rice, then you should give us 10
kilograms of beef."
</P>
<P>
"Under such circumstances," he said, he was pessimistic for the
prospects of restoring governmental level contacts between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the fertilizer aid should be treated as an economic
and humanitarian issue without any pre-conditions. "We're not
begging for it. We could manage without fertilizer aid from
the South because of our self-reliance policy," he said.
</P>
<P>
The South said it would provide fertilizer to the North only
after it agreed to opening a new round of working level talks on
April 25 at the village of Panmunjom to discuss the reunion issue.
</P>
<P>
"We'll never trade our sovereignty for material gains," Chun
said, adding that the North made major concessions when it agreed
to come to the current talks.
</P>
<P>
Jeong Se Hyun, head of the Republic of Korea (ROK) delegation,
said that the door is not closed to further talks and hoped the
North changes its stance to come back to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
He suggested a government envoy meeting be held before June.
</P>
<P>
Jeong reiterated that the 200,000-tons fertilizer aid would not
be shipped to the North unless it agreed to a date to open a
reunion meeting place at the border.
</P>
<P>
"We could not break down the barrier of mistrust," he said.
</P>
<P>
The North informed the South midnight, Friday, that it was
unnecessary to hold any more sessions, as the South would stand
firm by its position, thus leading the talks to an end.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the DPRK delegation will remain in Beijing while
the ROK delegation will leave for home tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said although the talks yielded no progress,
it had laid down some bases for the improvement of the
South-North relations and its symbolic meaning is far-reaching
after a four-year break between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The talks started April 11, and five delegates from each side
attended. The DPRK proposed Beijing as the venue for the talks and
the ROK agreed.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the outcome
of the week-long Beijing talks.

<HEADLINE> US Firm Proposes to Build Container Terminals in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- A US-Bangladesh joint venture firm
has proposed to set up and operate container terminals in
Chittagong and Dhaka, and run container barge service between
these two points, The Financial Express daily reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In its integrated proposal submitted to the Bangladeshi
Ministry of Shipping, the joint venture firm, Stevedoring Services
of America (SSA), stated that it would need to invest about 438
million U.S. dollars to implement the project.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Shipping has sent a summary on the proposal to
the Council Committee on Economic Affairs seeking its approval
after examining the SSA's proposal, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Shipping has proposed for acquisition of land
by the government in Chittagong for handing over to the SSA for
setting up container terminals and container yards.
</P>
<P>
It also proposed for sale or lease-out of land already acquired
by a local firm for building an inland port in Dhaka to the SSA.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi side stated in its summary that with its vast
experience in implementing this type of project in many countries,
the SSA would be able to establish container terminals and yards
in Dhaka and Chittagong in two to three years.
</P>
<P>
The operation of container terminals and berths and running of
container barge service between Dhaka and Chittagong would go a
long way to resolving the congestion and operation problems at
Chittagong port, the newspaper noted.
</P>
<P>
According to SSA's proposal, it would set up 1070-meter long
container berth and a container yard and other backyard facilities
on 98 hectares of land in Chittagong, 224 kilometers southeast of
Dhaka, and a 450-meter long container berth and a container yard
on the south bank of Buriganga river in Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the SSA would procure all types of equipment as
required to operate container terminal and berth, and would run
ten container barges between the two cities.
</P>
<P>
In the proposal, the SSA also stated that it would be able to
handle about 300,000 containers with the facilities established by
them.
</P>
<P>
At present, yearly growth rate in container movement through
Chittagong port is 15 percent. The port handled 290,000 containers
in the 1996-97 fiscal year. By the year 2002-2003, the port will
have to handle 671,000 containers if the growth rate in container
handling remained static.

<HEADLINE> 10 percent Teachers in California Uncredentialed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Almost 10 percent of teachers
in California have no proper credentials, San Francisco Examiner
reported.
</P>
<P>
Of the 218,000 teachers in California, about 20,000 did not
have a teaching certificate last year, according to a preliminary
report by the state Commission on Teacher Credentialing.
</P>
<P>
Because of the drive to cut class size in kindergarten through
third grade, schools in California hire teachers with emergency
permits or waivers.
</P>
<P>
Teachers with emergency permits generally have some classroom
experience and are working toward their credentials. Those hired
on waivers may have no classroom experience but must earn a
teaching credential within five years of being hired.
</P>
<P>
Since 1996, primary-level emergency credentials have increased 115
percent and secondary-level credentials 22 percent. Of the 18,600
teachers hired since 1996, the overwhelming majority were beginning
teachers or teachers on waivers or emergency permits.
</P>
<P>
To earn a teaching credential, candidates must have a bachelor's
degree, complete a one-year program of teaching methodology, spend a
semester as a student and pass a test of basic skills.
</P>
<P>
The challenge of finding qualified teachers is increasingly acute
in California, the most populous state in the country, because a
record number of teachers will soon retire, and the student population
is expected to surge by one million to 6.4 million by 2005.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, more than 50,000 people have entered teaching on
emergency or waiver permits in recent years, And 28 percent of
teachers lack either an academic minor or major in their assigned
subjects, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.

<HEADLINE> Portugal Sees China as Strategic Partner: Guterres </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- China is an important strategic
partner in Portugal's foreign relations, especially in its future
relations with Asian countries, says Portuguese Prime Minister
Antonio Guterres.
</P>
<P>
Guterres was speaking to Chinese correspondents here on the eve
of his visit to China scheduled to begin Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said his visit was aimed at enhancing confidence and
understanding between the two countries as well as promoting
Portuguese investment in China.
</P>
<P>
He said he wanted to deliver a political message to the
Portuguese business circle through his visit, encouraging them to
give priority to China in internationalizing their enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Guterres gave a positive evaluation of the Portuguese-Chinese
relations, saying the two countries enjoyed a good political
relationship.
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to meet Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji during his
stay in Beijing, which he described as a further expression of the
friendly cooperation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese prime minister said he saw great significance
and potential in developing mutually beneficial cooperation with
China in political, economic, and science and technology fields.
</P>
<P>
Portugal, in the capacity of a member country of the European
Union, was willing to play a positive part in promoting Euro-Asia
relations, especially Sino-European Union relations.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Macao, Guterres said he recognized the special
significance and the inevitable course of history in China's
resumption of exercising its sovereignty over Macao on December
31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that his government would assume an active, earnest
manner and full trust in the future Special Administrative Region
of Macao in the bid to ensure smooth transition.
</P>
<P>
He was fully confident the transition of Macao would help
strengthen the existing friendly relations between Portugal and
China.

SINGAPORE, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong and Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad jointly
opened on Saturday the Malaysia-Singapore Second Link, which was
described by Goh as "an important milestone in Singapore-Malaysia
relations."
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers signed a commemorative plaque and
jointly cut a ribbon to signify the official opening of the Second
Link, which bridges Tanjung Kupang in Johor, Malaysia, and Tuas in
western Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Goh said that the Malaysia-Singapore Second Crossing is not
just another great engineering feat. It is the symbol of a new
phase in Malaysia-Singapore relationship.
</P>
<P>
The Second Crossing will open up new areas for collaboration
between the private sectors of the two countries, he said, adding,
"This is a bridge to the future; it is for future needs."
</P>
<P>
The 1.9-km Second Crossing, or otherwise called Second Link,
was actually opened to traffic on January 2 this year, after
almost four years of construction work by the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The project is a fast way for Singaporeans to reach the
North-South Highway in Malaysia and will help ease the jam on the
Causeway, the first link between Woodlands, Singapore, and Johor
Baru, Malaysia.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Albania's parliament called for
the deployment of NATO troops in Serbia's Kosovo province on
Friday, the Albanian news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A motion adopted by deputies said NATO deployment would prevent
the current unrest in Kosovo from spreading to other parts of the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
The motion also asked U.S. President Bill Clinton to set up a
"red line" in Kosovo to protect ethnic Albanians there from being
attacked.
</P>
<P>
It called for the United Nations, all the European political
organizations, and the U.S. Congress to reconsider the Kosovo
issue and take effective measures.
</P>
<P>
The parliament backed Kosovo's Albanians in their quest for
political autonomy and urged the government to formulate a
detailed plan, according to the motion.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo, a Serbian province with an ethnic Albanian majority,
has sunk into chaos since ethnic Albanians calling for
independence from Serbia clashed with local Serb police.

<HEADLINE> Bank of Thailand Wants More Foreign Assistance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Governor of the Bank of Thailand
Chaiyawat Wilbulswasdi has called for more assistance from
industrialized countries to help reverse the economic turmoil in
the region.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the international community has a meaningful,
though differing, role to play in the resolution of the crisis
which is no longer domestic, nor regional in nature," Chaiyawat
said in remarks published by Saturday's Bangkok Post.
</P>
<P>
He said industrialized countries could influence not only the
pace, but also the direction, of how the crisis in one country
would be resolved.
</P>
<P>
Chaiyawat made the remarks as financial officials from the
Group of Seven nations and some Asian countries were meeting in
Washington to address the economic woes in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The concerted efforts within the region, Chaiyawat said, were
"a necessary but not sufficient, condition for the recovery."
</P>
<P>
"A more active participation by the countries in a strong
position is very much needed and thus called for," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Thailand, in its efforts to seek more international
aid, was committed to improving transparency in policy and the
disclosure of economic and financial data.
</P>
<P>
The financial sector reform, he said, was moving quickly, with
the closure of unviable finance companies and the recapitalization
and tougher standards imposed on operating banks and financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
He said Thailand had created favorable conditions for more
foreign investment. He cited the appreciation of the baht against
the dollar and inflation below projections.
</P>
<P>
He said a current account surplus for 1998 is forecast at more
than four percent of gross domestic product, compared with a
deficit of two percent last year and 7.9 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Chaiyawat agreed that although the situation had stabilized in
recent months, the crisis was far from over.
</P>
<P>
"Affected countries like Thailand are taking necessary, though
painful, steps to resolve the crisis and revitalize our
economies," he said.
</P>
<P>
"However, the major risks now lie more in the external
environment -- the risk of higher trade protectionism, and
declining investment and trade financing, and most importantly,
the occurrence of adverse systemic developments in the advanced
economies," he said.

<HEADLINE> Tourism Plan to Be Discussed Between Thailand, Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 18 (Xinhua) -- A joint tourism development plan
will be high on the agenda during next week's meeting between Thai
and Myanmar authorities, according to the Tourism Authority of
Thailand (TAT).
</P>
<P>
Thai PM's Office Minister Jurin Laksanavisit is scheduled to
meet Myanmar's Minister of Hotels and Tourism Saw Lwin in Chiang
Rai province, northern Thailand, on April 25-26, the TAT was
quoted Saturday by the Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Jurin, who oversees the tourism authority of Thailand, has
planned to raise the joint tourism development plan at the two-day
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Under the joint development proposal, Mae Sot district of
northern Thailand's Tak province will be made a gateway to
Myanmar, and other border towns in Tak province and Myanmar will
be developed into tourism attractions.
</P>
<P>
The TAT has set aside a 10-million baht (250,000 U.S. dollars)
budget to develop tourism spots in Tak province.
</P>
<P>
If Myanmar agrees with the joint tourism development plan, the
number of tourists visiting the two countries would rise sharply
and more income will be generated for local people, a TAT official
said.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rican Banana Sector Seeks Better Image </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Costa Rican banana industry
is planning a series of activities to counter a growing concern
among Europeans regarding the health and welfare of banana workers.
</P>
<P>
Some European countries have accused Costa Rica of not showing
the proper concern for the working conditions or basic rights of
banana workers.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the industry's institutional council and the
labor union for the plantation workers met Tuesday to analyze the
labor problems and seek solutions to improve Costa Rica's image in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Luis Umana, Banana Institutional Council director, said the
meeting also aims to increase sales of Costa Rican bananas to
international markets and erase the bad image of the sector.
</P>
<P>
There is a lot of misinformation and ignorance in Europe about
the conditions of Costa Rican banana workers, Umana said.
</P>
<P>
He, however, added that quality of the fruit, social and labor
stability, and the environmental conditions must be improved.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica is the second largest exporter of bananas in the
world after Ecuador. The country exported 101 million boxes of
bananas in 1997, earning 545 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Alcohol Lobby Gives U.S. Congress Millions of Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- A new study shows that over
the past decade the alcoholic beverages lobby has made 26 million
dollars in political contributions to Congressional candidates, as
well as the Democratic and Republican parties.
</P>
<P>
The study, issued Friday by public interest group Common Cause,
shows Speaker Newt Gingrich was the top recipient in the House of
Representatives, taking in 163,243 dollars. Senator Mitch
McConnell, a Republican, led in the Senate, receiving 112,627
dollars from the alcohol lobby in the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Other leading recipients included Representative Vic Fazio, a
Democrat, at 115,952 dollars; Senator Kay Baily Hutchison, a
Republican, at 99,750 dollars, and Senate Democratic leader Tom
Daschle, at 97,399 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The study, which covers January 1987 to December 1997,
indicates that the alcohol lobby gave more than 16.7 million
dollars in political action contributions to House and Senate
candidates, and donated to political parties more than 9.4 million
dollars in soft-money contributions -- the unregulated donations
supposed to be used for party-building activities such as
get-out-the-vote drives.
</P>
<P>
The alcohol industry recently succeeded in keeping Congress
from adopting a nationwide blood-alcohol content level of 0.08 for
drunken driving, which Common Cause attributes to the money the
lobby has given to candidates and the political parties.
</P>
<P>
Common Cause President Ann McBride said: "The alcohol lobby has
become drunk with power by using big money to undermine public
safety. By caving in to the alcohol lobby, Congress is guilty of a
DUI, -- 'deciding under the influence,' -- the influence of more
than 26 million dollars in campaign contributions."
</P>
<P>
Among the leading contributors were the National Beer
Wholesalers Association, the National Restaurant Association,
Joseph E. Seagram &AMP; Son, and Anheuser-Busch.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Forest Fires Cause 625 Million Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia has lost over 5
trillion rupiah (625 million U.S. dollars) in timber revenues due
to fires which have ravaged more than 283,000 hectares of forest
in East Kalimantan province, a local official said.
</P>
<P>
Head of the provincial office of the Environmental Impact
Management Agency Awang Faroek Ishak said Friday in Samarinda,
capital of East Kalimantan province, that fires had destroyed at
least 105,900 hectares belonging to logging concessionaires,
75,000 hectares on timber estate areas and 71,000 hectares in
Kutai National Park, reports reaching here Saturday said.
</P>
<P>
He said the disaster had also damaged forestry by-products such
as wood resin and rattan. It has also destroyed some of the area's
natural biodiversity, a loss which is "unaccountable".
</P>
<P>
Intensive efforts to put out the fires, which started in
January this year, have so far proven futile.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to extinguish the blazes -- blamed largely on big
companies and farmers using slash-and-burn methods to clear land
for planting -- have generally been unsuccessful in the
drought-stricken province where little rain has been recorded
since last July.

<P>
SINGAPORE, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore government has
introduced new regulations to curb software piracy at the source,
national newspaper the Straits Times reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Under the new rules, makers of optical disks, including compact
disks (CDs) and video CDs used for computer software and movies,
are now compelled to obtain licenses to import the equipment
needed to manufacture master copies and duplicate the disks.
</P>
<P>
And the new regulations allow only manufacturers approved by
the government Economic Development Board (EDB) to import
mastering and replication equipment for CDs, CD-read only memory
(CD-ROM), video CDs, digital video disks (DVD) and DVD-ROMs.
</P>
<P>
One of the conditions for approval is an undertaking not to
violate intellectual property rights. Those who violate this
condition will have their licenses to manufacture revoked, the
report said, citing a statement issued by the EDB, the Ministry of
Trade and Industry, and the Trade Development Board (TDB).
</P>
<P>
It said that approved manufacturers also need TDB approval to
transfer the equipment to another company, re-export it after use,
or to dispose of it as scrap.

Nine local optical disk manufacturers signed a code of conduct
on Friday in which they undertook to help in the fight against

MEXICO CITY, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Fishing along the western

the "El Nino" phenomenon improved the size of many catches for

He said Mexico's fishery income rose to 70 million U.S. dollars

</P>
<P>
However, the "El Nino" also brought storms and swells to the
region that prevented fishermen from making more fishing trips.

The "El Nino," which means "The Baby" in Spanish, is a warm

BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese government has vowed to

<HEADLINE> A Preserve of Ancient Heritage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Pingyao heard the happy news at
the end of 1997, that Unesco had added this ancient town to its
World Cultural Heritage List, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
Located in North China's Shanxi Province, Pingyao is believed
to be one of the few places in China where people can still see
what a Chinese county seat looked like centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
Pingyao was originally established as a military stronghold
more than 2,700 years ago. Situated on the eastern bank of the
Fenhe River, a branch of the Yellow River, and at the northern
foot of Taiyue Mountain, Pingyao had a very advantageous military
location at that time.
</P>
<P>
Pingyao has remained a county seat since 221 BC when China was
first united as a kingdom. The current town of Pingyao was built
in 1370 during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), and its layout and
the architecture of its buildings are typical of that time.
Covering an area of more than two square kilometers, the
historical city is so well preserved it is said that it would be
possible for residents who lived there 600 years ago to know their
way around today.
</P>
<P>
In Pingyao, once headquarters for big commercial firms from the
17th century to the 1930s, visitors can explore the one-glorious
banking business of Shanxi by strolling around the remains of
Piaohao, the province's earliest banks. China's first money
exchange shop, Rishengchang, was established there in the early
19th century as a result of local economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the local government is co-operating in the
construction of a new town nearby where factories and residential
zones will be moved.
</P>
<P>
This move will help preserve Pingyao's precious cultural
heritage from the kind of damage that would certainly come with
undirected change, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Kuchma Says Ukraine's Foreign Policy to Remain Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
told a foreign ministry meeting that the dismissing of Hennady
Udovenko does not mean a change in the country's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma named career diplomat Borys Tarasyuk as Ukraine's new
foreign minister on Friday, replacing Udovenko, who quit earlier
this month to take up a seat in parliament, said the
Interfax-Ukraine news agency.
</P>
<P>
Tarasyuk, 49, was ambassador to the Benelux countries (Belgium,
Holland and Luxemburg) and NATO until receiving the new job.
</P>
<P>
Udovenko, a member of the People's Movement party, won a
parliamentary seat in the March 29 election and under Ukrainian
law had to leave his cabinet post.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma told diplomats that "Ukraine's foreign policy must not
be pro-Western or pro-Eastern."
</P>
<P>
Valery Pustovoitenko, prime minister of Ukraine, said a more
united action should be apparent within the government as a result
of the personnel change.
</P>
<P>
Pustovoitenko said the major task of the foreign ministry this
year is to implement the Ukrainian-Russian economic cooperation
pact signed on February 27. The prime minister also said the
foreign ministry must ensure the annual meeting in May of the
European Bank of Reconstruction and Development.
</P>
<P>
Tarasyuk also told reporters that Ukraine's foreign policies
must always focus on the national interest.
</P>
<P>
He said the pacts signed with the Kremlin in the past years are
the foundations for the strategic partnership between the two
countries. This partnership should contain more concrete actions,
he added.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Fight Dengue Fever </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian central government
called on all provincial governors to step up efforts to fight an
extraordinary outbreak of dengue fever, which has claimed 207
lives and left 7,585 hospitalized in the past few months.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by Minister of Health Farid Anfasa Moeloek
Friday after attending a ministerial meeting on social welfare
here, local leading newspapers said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said use of mass fumigation was a short-term
solution to preventing the spread of the mosquito-borne disease,
and the best method was by eliminating the sites where the insects
bred.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, governors, regents, mayors and health officials
need to be fully involved to promote a healthy and clean way of
living," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry termed this year's outbreak an
"extraordinary incidence" in which fatalities had been recorded in
11 provinces. It warned it would likely continue until June.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Saroso, the official in charge of combating
animal-transmitted diseases, said Friday that Jakarta was hardest
hit, with at least 42 deaths and 3,900 hospitalized since January.
</P>
<P>
"The number of victims will continue to increase if mass
fumigation operations are not regularly and thoroughly conducted,"
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the capital, he said, high numbers of cases were
recorded in South Sumatra, South Sulawesi, North Sulawesi, Jambi,
Lampung, Southeast Sulawesi, Central Sulawesi, West Nusa Tenggara
and Maluku.
</P>
<P>
Dengue fever, an acute tropical disease transmitted by
mosquitoes, leaves its victims with fever, rash and severe pains
in the joints and back. The cholera-like disease, known locally as
"muntaber", causes vomiting and diarrhea.

<HEADLINE> Taliban, Northern Alliance Agree to Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Taliban militia and the
anti-Taliban Northern Alliance have agreed to hold face-to-face
talks for the first time in over a year, U.S. President's special
envoy Bill Richardson said here Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here at the American Center after
a day-long visit to Afghanistan, Richardson said the Taliban and
the Northern Alliance agreed to hold the proposed talks scheduled
for April 27 in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
"We hope this meeting under U.N. and OIC (Organization of
Islamic Conference) auspices will be the first step on a path to a
negotiated peace in Afghanistan," Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed not to launch new military offensives
until they meet in face-to-face talks in Islamabad later this
month, he said.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no further military offensives, and the two
sides would discuss the proposal of holding of an Ulema (scholar)
Commission meeting, for permanent ceasefire and establishing a
broad-based government in Afghanistan", Richardson added.
</P>
<P>
Richardson arrived here Wednesday evening on a three-day visit.
He met with the Pakistani leaders including Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif and Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan and held extensive
discussions on matters concerning the Afghan and Kashmir issues.
</P>
<P>
The special envoy visited Afghanistan Friday where he met
separately with second most senior Taliban leader Mullah Rabbani,
leader of the Northern Alliance Burhanuddin Rabbani, Uzbek ethnic
warlord General Rashid Dostam and Hezbi-Wadat Chairman Kharim
Khalili.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters soon after his day-long visit to
Afghanistan, Richardson said the agreement reached Friday between
the two Afghan rival factions would not have been possible without
the active support of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Richardson said that on humanitarian assistance, the two Afghan
factions agreed to enable relief workers to work in a safe and
secure environment, to work in accordance with internationally
accepted standards.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban and the Northern Alliance also agreed not to permit
terrorism from the Afghan soil and to combat drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
On the Northern Alliance side, they agreed "to support strongly
a negotiated settlement to lead to a broad-based government, to
set up their efforts to protect humanitarian personnel and
property and to accept a U.N. special rapporteur to investigate
human rights abuses," according to Richardson.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on the Taliban side, they agreed to meet the U.N.
team on April 20, to allow Afghan female doctors to provide care
for women and girls, as well as allow the U.N. to hire Afghan
women to deliver humanitarian assistance to women and girls,
Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
"As a good-faith gesture, the Taliban said they will release a
few prisoners in the next couple of days," he added.
</P>
<P>
The special envoy said that "this was not a solitary effort on
the part of the U.S. It was part of the six plus two process led
by the U.N. Envoy to Afghanistan, Lakdhir Brahimi."
</P>
<P>
The Six plus two includes Afghanistan's neighboring states,
plus the U.S. and Russia.
</P>
<P>
On the agreement reached between the Taliban and the Northern
Alliance, Richardson said, "what will really matter is not what
they said today, but what they'll do in the days ahead."

<HEADLINE> Italians Strict with Officials: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 17 (Xinhua) -- A recent poll shows many Italians
are iron-hearted towards scandal-tainted officials but rather
lenient towards petty offenses of law.
</P>
<P>
The Italian Census, which polled some 2,000 people in its
latest research on criminality and justice in the country, said 95
percent of those polled wanted officials to resign if they were
involved in scandals.
</P>
<P>
Close to 40 percent said officials should resign the minute
they come under investigation.
</P>
<P>
As many as 54 percent of those polled agreed that the Clean
Hand anti-corruption operation had been a valid instrument for
cleaning up the country's political and public administration
systems.
</P>
<P>
The study, however, suggested widespread indulgence of petty
crimes among Italians, who believe petty offenses do not
constitute a threat to society.
</P>
<P>
Among those polled, 40 percent said breaking the law was
admissible in certain cases.

<P>
As a result, a large number of key construction projects have
been completed over the years, such as an expressway between
Haikou and the port city of Sanya, the Sanya Phoenix Airport and
the expansion of the Sanya Port, whose handling capacity of 5.4
million tons per year is about half of the combined handling
capacity of all ports in Hainan.
</P>
<P>
To date all telephones in Hainan's ethnic minority areas are
program-controlled while all long-distance transmission is
digitalized.
</P>
<P>
"The updating of our statistics often cannot catch up with the
rate at which great changes take place in the minority areas," a
provincial official said.
</P>
<P>
Over the last 10 years, Hainan's ethnic minority areas have
utilized one billion U.S. dollars of overseas investment, which
has helped to fund more than 900 construction projects.
</P>
<P>
For all the visible changes, the ethnic minority people
consider their development of market ideas as more significant
than anything else.
</P>
<P>
"We used to know nothing about how to plant vegetables and felt
ashamed of doing business," said Lan Chunhua, head of a village of
Li people.
</P>
<P>
But today, Lan is leading his villagers to plant and peddle
vegetables as well as to do business in processing and
transportation.
</P>
<P>
"Market economy ideas and the idea of becoming rich through
diligence have taken deep roots in people's heart," said Li
Mingtian, a Miao people and also vice chairman of CPPCC Hainan
Provincial Committee.
</P>
<P>
"These are ideas that we never dreamed of," he said.
</P>
<P>
Because of the construction drive in the last 10 years,
Hainan's poverty-ridden population has dropped from 870,000 to
250,000 people. More than 500,000 ethnic minority people have
moved out of thatched huts and into bright and spacious
tile-roofed and brick-walled houses.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that the gross domestic product of Hainan
areas inhabited by ethnic minorities soared fivefold rise between
1987 and 1997, during which the per capita income of the
province's rural residents jumped from 430 yuan to 1,318 yuan.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Chile and Mexico signed a free
trade agreement on the eve of the Second Summit of the Americas
scheduled here for April 18-19.
</P>
<P>
The treaty was signed by the presidents of Chile, Eduardo Frei,
and Mexico, Ernesto Zedillo, who is here to attend the summit.
</P>
<P>
The treaty replaces and amplifies the Economic Complementation
Accord signed here also by the two countries on September 27,
1991, which went into force on January 1, 1992.
</P>
<P>
The new treaty accelerates full access to each other's markets
and the process of incorporating products in the list of
exceptions, which has been reduced, to the list of full exemptions
for trade between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two countries agree in the treaty that export subsidies for
agricultural and livestock goods will be eliminated by January 1,
2003, while subsidies for non-agricultural products will be
governed by commitments made to the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
Mexican Secretary of Foreign Relations Rosario Green and
Chilean Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat also signed, on behalf of
their respective governments, an agreement to prevent double
taxation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
President Zedillo said during the signing ceremony that the
agreements mean the two countries are fulfilling their obligations
to help integrate the continent.
</P>
<P>
President Frei said the treaty reflects the political will of
Latin American countries to make the integration real, a long
awaited dream of the region.
</P>
<P>
Both presidents think the agreements will promote commercial
exchanges and investments between the two countries based on
previous agreements and their achievements.
</P>
<P>
There has been a significant increase in commercial exchanges
between them because of the Economic Complementation Accord. The
total value of bilateral trade has increased from 158 million
U.S. dollars in 1990, to 1.452 billion dollars in 1997.

<P>
HAIKOU, April 18 (Xinhua) -- In a trip to a village in south
China's island province of Hainan five years ago, Chinese
President Jiang Zemin heaped praise on Li Dehui and his family for
their success in developing a courtyard economy.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he was encouraged by news that Li and his family
made an annual income of more than 70,000 yuan, a huge sum by
Chinese standards even today.
</P>
<P>
Li and his family deserved the appreciation of Jiang, who has
also been General Secretary of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China, for they were  the first and only
well-off family at that time in Wenmen Village, Tianya Town of
Sanya, China's southernmost city.
</P>
<P>
Five years later, Li's family is no longer so special as more
and more of the Li ethnic group have begun to catch up.
</P>
<P>
"Today there are many people with incomes at the same level of
mine," Li told Xinhua in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
Like many other ethnic minority people, the 1.2 million Li
people on Hainan Island, which was part of Guangdong Province
until it was made a province and China's largest special economic
zone 10 years ago, have experienced rapid economic growth during
the past decade.
</P>
<P>
"The last 10 years marked the most rapid economic growth in the
history of Hainan areas inhabited by ethnic minority groups," said
Wang Jiaxian, also of the native Li group.
</P>
<P>
"I have seen with my own eyes the great changes that have taken
place in my hometown," said Wang, who is vice chairman of the
Hainan Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), the country's top advisory body.
</P>
<P>
The changes are, most of all, reflected by significant
improvement in the infrastructure facilities in areas of ethnic
minority groups.
</P>
<P>
The central and provincial governments have over the last 10
years invested more than 22.6 billion yuan to improve the
infrastructure in areas populated by ethnic minorities.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Some 12 ancient murals recording
the life of Sakyamuni were recently discovered in the Mtho-ldin
Temple in the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Experts have identified the ancient artifacts as the fourth
kind of such paintings related to the life of the founder of
Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
The temple, the largest of its kind in western Tibet, is
located in Ngari Prefecture which was home to a flourishing
kingdom some 300 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The three-year excavation project yielded more than 20 wall
paintings, statues of Buddha and incomplete Buddhist sutras.
</P>
<P>
The excavations also yielded a cache of building materials,
including door jambs, thresholds and flights of stairs. Experts
note that the articles will provided a basis for future
reconstruction projects.

<HEADLINE> Italy, U.S. Call for Direct Dialogue in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Italy and the United States called
on those parties involved in the ethnic conflict in the Serbian
province of Kosovo to end the violence and open dialogue
immediately.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after a meeting on Friday, Italian
Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini and American Assistant Secretary of
State Strobe Talbott demanded that Serbian police "respect human
rights," and ethnic Albanians in Kosovo "explicitly renounce the
pursuit of political ends through force."
</P>
<P>
The two parties should "launch direct dialogue without delay"
and begin negotiations on what sort of autonomous status Kosovo
should have, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Talbott, who flew to Rome Friday from Bonn, is currently on a
tour of European capitals to seek a consensus on a plan of action
to resolve the ethnic tension in Kosovo which have reportedly
claimed at least dozens of lives since February.
</P>
<P>
The statement went on to stress that a solution must be found
to respect the territorial integrity of the Yugoslav Republic,
human rights and the international rules on ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
So far ethnic Albanians in Kosovo have refused Serbia's
invitation to join talks on autonomy; they are insisting on
secession.

<HEADLINE> Inter-Korean Talks Ends without Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) - The first inter-Korean high-level
contact broke down here today after a week-long fruitless talks,
and no date was decided for a possible resumption.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) delegation
has declared an end to the talks.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the DPRK said that it was unnecessary for the two
five-member delegations to meet again as scheduled this morning.
</P>
<P>
"It is meaningless to have any further talks. We'll not attend
any further meetings today," the sources said, adding that the
Republic of Korea (ROK) stands firm by their conditions attached
to the fertilizer aid issue.
</P>
<P>
At 9:00 A.M. today, the ROK delegation will hold a press
conference, followed by one to be given by the DPRK side.
</P>
<P>
Yesterday, Chun Kum Chul, chief delegate of the DPRK, said that
the South should not link the fertilizer aid with the reunion of
separated families, hinting the talks may end Saturday otherwise.
</P>
<P>
"If the South ships the fertilizer to the North, talks on the
reunion issue can begin immediately when the Red Cross talks
resume," Chun said.
</P>
<P>
Jeong Se Hyun, leader of the ROK delegation, reiterated his
position that the North should agree to a timetable to help
reunite separated families in return for fertilizer aid from the
South.
</P>
<P>
The 200,000 tons of fertilizer that the ROK offers can be
delivered this year, but the fertilizer aid and reunion issues
must be discussed simultaneously at the current talks, he stated.

<HEADLINE> Major U.S., Asian Airlines Confident in Far East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The recent decision by United
Airlines to suspend daily nonstop service between San Francisco
and Seoul has not affected other major U.S. and Asian airlines.
</P>
<P>
In fact, those airlines and San Francisco International Airport
continue to express confidence in an economic recovery in the Far
East. Some airlines are even adding flights in the region.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Chicago-based United said it would suspend its San
Francisco-Seoul fight on May 5 "in light of the current economic
crisis." It would also suspend flights between Osaka, Japan, and
Seoul beginning July 8. "Korea has been particularly hard hit
during the crisis, and we have been unable to achieve sustained
profitability on those routes," United said.
</P>
<P>
The United announcement has not seemed to dim the ongoing
expansion of San Francisco International Airport. The expansion,
costing 2.4 billion U.S. dollars, includes a new international
terminal, based on projections that San Francisco will serve a
huge, developing Asian market in years to come -- particularly in
China.
</P>
<P>
Those projections remain unchanged, airport officials said,
despite a 12.8 percent decline in passengers to and from Asia when
comparing 188,300 passengers this February with 237,500 a year
ago. The airport said that passenger decline would be not be a
long-term trend.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of Singapore Airlines in Los Angeles has also
expressed similar conviction that the market will return in the
next two years. The company anticipates no schedule changes in
light of the economic downturn, although it has put passengers on
smaller airplanes on some routes when bookings decline.
</P>
<P>
In much of Asia, airlines are actually increasing their routes.
</P>
<P>
United is increasing service between Chicago and Japan and Hong
Kong, China.
</P>
<P>
TWA has been given authority for its first route, St. Louis to
Tokyo, beginning in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Japan Airlines will add a flight between San Francisco and
Tokyo in July.
</P>
<P>
Korean Airlines also said that no changes are planned in
service to and from Seoul, San Francisco and other U.S. and
Canadian cities.

<HEADLINE> IMF, World Bank Close Spring Meetings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) and the World Bank closed their spring meetings after
the bank's Development Committee finished a session Friday by
urging strengthening of the financial system.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day meetings, finance leaders focused on the
Asian financial crisis and ways to prevent and resolve such
crises.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting of the World Bank Development
Committee, Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, the
meeting's chairman, said that if the international financial
system is not strengthened, "the problems may even exacerbate."
</P>
<P>
He also noted that there should be more cooperation between
the bank and the fund in crisis prevention and management.
</P>
<P>
"The committee encouraged strongly that the bank and the fund
continue to work together to get a collaboration, because the
issues and demands tend to be more complex," he said.
</P>
<P>
The committee urged the bank and the fund "to review and
reinforce their partnership based on their respective mandate,"
said a communique after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"This partnership has become even more important in light of
the growing significance of structural factors in assisting
member governments, and the increased demands on both
institutions," it added.
</P>
<P>
Members of the committee agreed that the implications of the
Asian financial crisis severely damaged the development
achievements in the region, particularly its "especially effective
anti-poverty performance," said the communique.
</P>
<P>
"Ministers urged the bank... to strengthen its ability to
address rapidly situations of this kind and to help governments
avoid such crises in the future," it added.
</P>
<P>
The committee urged the bank to assist countries in
strengthening key institutions and structural policies, and to
augment its skills and capacities in the financial sector,
corporate restructuring and governance and other areas.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges U.S.-Chilean Partnership for 21st </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, April 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
renewed here Friday his call for a strong partnership between the
United States and Chile as the world is entering the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
While addressing the joint sitting of the National Congress at
Valparaiso, the U.S. leader spoke highly of the democratic
development on this hemisphere and the bilateral relations between
his country and Chile.
</P>
<P>
"Chile and the United States must be full partners in the 21st
century," he stressed. "We must also be full partners with
like-minded democracies throughout our region."
</P>
<P>
Clinton also called for pursuance of "a second generation of
reforms" that are beyond free elections and free markets. He urged
the leaders to ensure that the "political system, the legal
system, the economic system are not rigged to favor those who
already have much, but instead give everyone a stake in shaping
the future."
</P>
<P>
According to the U.S. leader, "a second generation of reform"
requires a strong and independent legislature to represent all the
people, but also requires fighting against corruption, protecting
the environment and attacking threats to it, as well as raising
the level of education and people's life.
</P>
<P>
Chile is a shining star in America's constellation -- stable
and resilient with budget surpluses, a high savings rate, a high
growth rate, low unemployment, and low inflation, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president concluded his two-day state visit to Chile
Friday before joining other 33 leaders of the Americas in the
Second Summit scheduled for April 18.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the leaders of the two countries agreed to
broaden the scope of trade ties by establishing a U.S.-Chile Joint
Commission on Trade and Investment. Since 1993, the bilateral
trade between Chile and the U.S. has grown at an average of 13
percent a year, which reached 6.7 billion U.S. dollars in 1997.

NEW YORK, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Crude oil futures tumbled
Friday, giving back gains made Thursday on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, after the U.N. secretary-general said he was pleased
with the inspection program searching out Iraqi chemical and
biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
A bumbling happened in crude futures after a U.N. spokesman
quoted Secretary-General Kofi Annan as saying he was "pleased with
the unlimited access" U.N. inspectors have had in searching Iraqi
palaces where weapons labs are suspected to be hidden.
</P>
<P>
Further lifting crude futures was news that Iraq had demanded
the Security Council lift economic sanctions when it meets this
month to review the status of Baghdad's weapons program.
</P>
<P>
Crude for May delivery fell 44 cents, or 2.8 percent, to 15.46
U.S. dollars a barrel. May heating oil and unleaded gasoline also
fell.
</P>
<P>
Cotton futures fell sharply on the New York Cotton Exchange.
</P>

July cotton fell 1.28 cents, or 1.9 percent, to 63.78 cents a
pound.

<HEADLINE> Casio to Demo New Mega Pixel Digital Camera </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Casio, Inc., a major Japanese
electronic company, announced in its New Jersey venture Friday
that it will demonstrate Casio's new QV-5000SX true mega pixel
digital camera during the upcoming COMDEX show, Chicago, Illinois,
on April 20-23, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The new QV-5000SX will be available later this spring with an
estimated street price of 599 U.S. dollars, the company said. The
camera features 1.3-million-pixel CCD, Auto Focus, 2X/4X digital
zoom, an optical viewfinder, built-in 4-mode flash, and other
powerful features and functions, it said.
</P>
<P>
The new camera allows the user to select either 32, 48 or 64
frames, both at 0.1-second intervals and play them back on the
camera as a movie or save them on to a PC and use the included
software to make 3.2, 4.8 or 6.4 second movies at 10fps.
</P>
<P>
The camera has a panorama recording and playback feature. It
allows you to create 360 degree panorama picture by using the
panorama guide feature. Both movies and panoramas can be recorded
and played back using the camera itself, without the need of any
special options or additional software.
</P>
<P>
The 1.3-million-pixel high-definition CCD outputs to a computer
measure 1,280 by 960 dots. This results in images of outstanding
detail and definition and near photographic quality for printouts.

<HEADLINE> Syrian FM: Prospects of Ties With Qatar Bright </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The prospects of the
Syrian-Qatari ties were promising as Damascus and Doha have
overcome their past differences, Syria's Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Sharaa said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at Damascus International Airport where
he welcomed his Qatari counterpart Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim Bin Jabir
al-Thani, al-Sharaa said that "the prospects of bilateral ties are
bright and promising."
</P>
<P>
Al-Thani arrived here on Friday evening for an official visit
to Syria after touring Algeria and Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that al-Thani's visit to Syria will serve as an
opportunity for exchanging views and clearing the positions of
both countries to serve bilateral and Arab interests," al-Sharaa
said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there are no disputes between Syria and Qatar,
adding "we believe that the reasons that led to a kind of
laxity in bilateral relations were removed."
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Qatari relations underwent a period of coldness
after Qatar's decision to allow Israel to open a trade office in
its capital Doha.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, Al-Thani said Qatar hopes Israel would
unconditionally pull out its troops from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"Qatar is seriously considering shutting down the Israeli trade
office in Doha due to the continuation of the deadlock in the
peace process," Al-Thani added.
</P>
<P>
Asked about reports on the probability of holding an Arab
summit, the Qatari official said if there is a reason for holding
a mini or expanded summit, "we would welcome such a summit as
Qatar is keen on maintaining a consensus and clear position (among
the Arabs) on the current Israeli intransigence."
</P>
<P>
The two ministers later held talks on the latest developments
in the region and ways of promoting bilateral ties, according to
the spokesman of the Syrian Foreign Ministry.

UNITED NATIONS, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The security Council of
the United Nations Friday decided to deploy 10 U.N. military
liaison officers in Sierra leone.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the council reviewed U.N. Secretary-General

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dollar Rises Against Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar rose against the
mark Friday as a rising U.S. stock market boosted the U.S.
currency while world markets fell.
</P>
<P>
The dollar was quoted at 1.8083 marks, up from 1.8057 late
Thursday. The U.S. currency also changed hands at 131.79 yen,
unchanged from late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During New York trading, the dollar fell when the United States
released economic figures indicating a slowing economy.
</P>
<P>
Traders held back in swapping yen for dollars because of their
uncertainty about whether the Bank of Japan would again intervene
to support the yen.
</P>
<P>
The British pound was quoted at 1.6832 U.S. dollars, down from
1.6909 U.S. dollars Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday: 1.4989 Swiss francs, down from 1.5033; 6.0595 French
francs, up from 6.0515; 1,787.00 Italian lire, up from 1,783.00;
and 1.4285 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4333.

<HEADLINE> Blair: EU to Contribute More to Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Visiting British Prime Minister
Tony Blair said here Friday that the European Union (EU) can make
further contribution to the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak after their talks, Blair said the EU is making a
major contribution to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"It is important that Europe uses that role as constructively
as possible for the progress of all," said Blair.
</P>
<P>
If the peace process does not move forward, it will be very
dangerous, he said, adding that the aim of his visit "is to try
and move the process forward." Britain is now holding the rotating
presidency of the EU.
</P>
<P>
"We don't expect we will come cross U.S. efforts but rather
make a complimentary role to what the American's has been doing,"
Blair said.
</P>
<P>
Blair arrived here Friday afternoon on a two-day visit to Egypt
as part of his multi-leg maiden tour of the Middle East aimed at
giving a shot to the stalled Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
The British prime minister is making the tour after a week of
the signing of the peace agreement in Northern Ireland. He said
some lessons should be drawn from the signing of the agreement and
expressed the hope that the lessons could be used to make progress
in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
A peace agreement was signed last Friday by the British and
Irish governments and eight political parties in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Mubarak said the EU's role is very important,
adding that it should not be independent to the U.S. role, but it
should rather complete the U.S. role. If it is independent, it
will not be helpful, he said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders reached an understanding that the Mideast peace
process should move forward, otherwise negative actions will
follow.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said his talks with Blair covered bilateral relations
and other issues.
</P>
<P>
As for bilateral ties, Blair said bilateral relations are very
strong, and they will get stronger.
</P>
<P>
Blair, on his debut trip to the region since taking office last
year, will explore prospects for stronger ties with Egypt during
his meetings with Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal El-Ganzouri and
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa Saturday.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, he is also scheduled to meet with members of the
British-Egyptian businessmen Association to examine the
possibility of increasing joint investments.
</P>
<P>
Blair's tour comes at a time when Europe is urged to play a more
active role in the stalemated Mideast peace process, especially
since the U.S.-dominated mediation efforts have so far failed to
unlock the peace logjam. U.S. Mideast peace envoy Dennis Ross will
begin a new round of shuttle diplomacy in the region in the coming
days.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who toured the region
last month, was snubbed in Israel allegedly for breaching an
understanding on the arrangements of his visit to the Har Homa in
East Jerusalem. Israel's Jewish settlement construction work at
the site is behind the long freeze in Palestinian-Israeli talks.
</P>
<P>
Britain has made it clear that the status of Jerusalem, the
thorniest issue in the Palestinian-Israeli track, should be
decided at the final stage of their negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Israel has repeatedly rejected European involvement in the
peace process, favoring an absolute mediating role for the
United States.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Industrial Investments Total 55 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The industrial long-standing
policy of Saudi Arabia has brought about tangible results in the
past two decades as total industrial investments increased from
2.7 billion U.S. dollars in 1975 to 55 billion dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait News Agency quoted a statistical abstract published
Friday as saying that the estimated overall number of running
plants in Saudi Arabia at the end of 1997 were 2674, with 73 of
them within the framework of joint Saudi-foreign capital
investments.
</P>
<P>
On top of the 1997 industrial list are the number of
petrochemical and plastic plants totaling 521, with total
investments of 36.6 billion dollars. They are followed by 490
construction, ceramics and glass plants with 6.19 billion dollars
of investments.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi Basic Industries Company, the pioneer in the field of
petrochemical industries, has an annual petrochemical production
of up to 23 million tonnes, with a future plan to upgrade
production to 28 million tonnes by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
The number of metal and equipment manufacturing plants which
rank the third are 727 with 4.27 billion dollars of investments.
</P>
<P>
There are 415 foodstuffs and beverages plants with 3.3 billion
dollars of investments. Various other plants have investments
of 4.64 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The tangible growth of Saudi industries over the past 22 years
underlines the kingdom's policy of diversifying income sources
apart from the mainstay of oil as the only source of income in the
world top oil producer and exporter.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia's oil reserves accounts for 10 percent of the
world proven reserves and currently produces more than 8 million
barrel of oil per day.

<HEADLINE> US Trade Deficit Increases 4.2 Percent in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The American trade deficit
climbed by 4.2 percent to 12.1 billion U.S. dollars in February,
the worst showing since the Administration began tracking these
figures on a monthly basis in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The new report, released Friday by the Commerce Department,
showed that the imbalance with Japan increased by 21 percent to
5.3 billion dollars from 4.4 billion dollars the previous month.
Meanwhile, the U.S. trade gap with many other Asian countries
struggling with financial crisis actually improved.
</P>
<P>
The American deficit with China narrowed by 17.5 percent to 3.5
billion dollars in February, a figure believed to be still bigger
than the Chinese account. The shortfall with Korea plunged 31.1
percent and that with Indonesia shrank by 8.2 percent, according
to the report.
</P>
<P>
It is feared that a widening trade deficit would stir more
criticism of the U.S. Administration's free trade policy in
Congress and result in more pressure on the Japanese government.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton and other government officials have
stepped up pressure on Japan to do its part to help the Asian
countries embroiled in the currency crisis and to provide a bigger
market for U.S. exports.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. deficit with Japan for February showed that U.S.
exports to Japan hit their lowest level in three years.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Undersecretary of Commerce for International Affairs
Robert Shapiro told reporters Friday:" We expect to see exports
rise from -- certainly from the countries that have been
struggling with currency problems. I don't have evidence that Japan
is trying to -- has changed policy in any way to increase exports
to the United States."
</P>
<P>
The official said that the Asian crisis will produce a drag on
U.S. economic growth. However, he added, "Declining exports to
Asia are offset to a very significant degree by the domestic
strength of the American economy."
</P>
<P>
"The exports -- U.S. exports to China have been growing for
some time. They (Chinese) have opened various sectors to American
investment. It continues to grow. It's showed very strong growth
thus far this year. Until we see other evidence, I see it as a
continuation of a pattern that's been in place for some time,"
Shapiro said.
</P>
<P>
However, some economists still believed that the deficit in
coming months with Asia will swell as the full impact of the
economic turbulences in the region are felt.

<HEADLINE> Trade Shows Go Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Omni Group, a U.S. company based
in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, announces spring show opening on
April 24, 1998, which will be on line 24 hours a day and seven
days a week with a world wide exposure.
</P>
<P>
The show site http://www.worldwideexpo.com/ is still under busy
construction, the company said.
</P>
<P>
On April 24, exhibitors will begin the World Wide Expo's spring
show: A three month show featuring inventors, entrepreneurs and
service providers. The company said show exhibition spaces for the
spring show are filling rapidly. Potential exhibitors who wish to
take part in this new marketing wave need to move fast "due to
limited exhibition spaces."
</P>
<P>
After the WORLD WIDE EXPO's exploded onto Internet last
January, a total of 32,758 people visited it during the first week
on line.
</P>
<P>
Like their exhibition hall counterpart, the pavilions at the
World Wide Expo offer the opportunity to sample of both
traditional and cutting edge goods and services.
</P>
<P>
For a fee that is less than a daily ad in a local newspaper,
exhibitors receive global exposure in a variety of media,
including radio, print, and television. Unlike the typical Expo
hall, all of this is available from the comfort of your home or
office.
</P>
<P>
Virtual reality real estate tours and vacation spot demos with
360 panoramic "walk through" use the most sophisticated technology
available on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The company said that what people miss from the World Wide Expo
are crowds, noise, long walks, standing in line and most time and
space limitations.
