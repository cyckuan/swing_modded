<HEADLINE> Egyptian, Eritrean Presidents Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
held talks here today with his Eritrean counterpart Isaias Afewerki
on a dispute between Eritrea and Yemen over three Red Sea islands.
</P>
<P>
Afewerki, on his second visit to Egypt since last March,
arrived here earlier today.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Afewerki did not brief reporters on their
discussion after their first 90-minute meeting. Then the two
resumed their talks this evening over an Iftar (fast-breaking)
banquet.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders had been expected to discuss mediation efforts
by Egypt, France and Ethiopia for a peaceful solution to the
dispute over the islands of Hanish, claimed by both Eritrea and
Yemen.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean president said in Rome Saturday that the dispute
over the islands, which sit astride major shipping lanes at the
southern end of the Red Sea, should be settled through
international arbitration.
</P>
<P>
The dispute flared up last December when Yemen and Eritrea had
a fierce battle. The Eritrean troops occupied the island of
Greater Hanish, while the other two islands are still in the hands
of Yemen.
</P>
<P>
Afewerki is expected to leave Cairo Monday.

JOHANNESBURG, February 11 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela announced here today he was considering inviting
Libyan leader Colonel Moamar Kadhafi to pay a visit to
Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
This would be to thank Kadhafi for his support during South
Africa's struggle for liberation, Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
Cuban President Fidel Castro had already been invited to visit
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said during the apartheid years many western countries
had supported the white rule, while Scandinavia, Cuba, Libya, and
some Asia's social countries, had provided unwavering support to
his liberation movement.
</P>
<P>
"It is through their support that we are empowered today," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela also disclosed that the head of a leading western
state had asked him to break ties with Cuba and Libya.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Syria, Arab League Studies Center Sign Cooperation Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Two agreements for scientific
cooperation were signed here today between Syria and the Arab
Center for Studies of Arid and Drought Areas, an offshoot of the
League of Arab States, to undertake joint research work.
</P>
<P>
The agreements were signed by Syrian Minister of Irrigation
Abdul Rahman Madani and Director of the Arab Center Hassan Saud.
</P>
<P>
According to an official Syrian source, the first agreement
calls for research work on the rationalization of irrigation water
and the use of modern irrigation technology "dribble" with a view
to improving efficiency and achieving optimum economization on
irrigation. The research work will be undertaken in a research
center of the Syrian Ministry of Irrigation at Beit Tima.
</P>
<P>
The second agreement, the source added, calls for studies on
the utilization of waste water and its effect on soil and plants,
and the tracing of certain microbes that sicken the soil and
plants. This study will take place at the Salmiya station for
treatment of waste water in the Syrian Hamat governorate.
</P>
<P>
The source went on to say that the initial period for the
implementation of the joint research contracts, as stipulated in
the two agreements, is one year renewable for up to five years
with the mutual consent of the two parties.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, the Arab states are suffering from scarce
water resources. According to official statistics, available water
resources in the Arab states are estimated at approximately 225
billion cubic meters a year, of which 98 percent are consumed by
the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
The economic circles calculate that the water deficit in the
year 2000 will reach 30 million cubic meters, unless new ways are
sought to develop water resources. Accordingly, the desalination
of sea water and the adoption of modern irrigation methods such as
"dribble" will help save water.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Records 2.2 Percent Growth In 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's economy grew 2.2
percent in 1995, up from the one percent growth recorded the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Paul Ogwuma, governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, said the
growth was lower than the target of four percent set for the
year.
</P>
<P>
The government linked the growth to agricultural production
which rose by 3.2 percent in 1995, compared to three percent in
1994.
</P>
<P>
He said the manufacturing sector, which declined by five percent
in 1994, grew by two percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Ogwuma stated that an improvement in economic performance was
negated by high consumer prices which showed an inflation rate of
about 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
On the country's external reserves, the governor said it grew
to 1.4 billion dollars in 1995 from 916 million dollars in 1994,
explaining that the government maintained tolerated budget
deficits in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Balkan Peace Conference Calls for Withdrawal of  Foreign Forces from Former Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Balkan peace groups meeting in
northern Greek city of Salonika issued a joint communique at the
end of a three-day conference today, calling for the withdrawal of
all foreign troops from former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The communique expressed concern over the imposition of the new
world order in the Balkans, saying that military alliances such as
NATO and the WEU were not the means to achieve solutions of
benefit to the region's peoples.
</P>
<P>
It characterized the presence of 60,000 NATO and other troops
in Bosnia as a form of foreign occupation, in which the Balkan
peoples found themselves under the supervision and tutelage of the
great powers. It attributed the fighting in former Yugoslavia to
the intervention of foreign powers and called for a collective
security system in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
A resolution was also passed calling on Turkey to conform to
international conventions and law and "stop using the threat of
war in its attempt to call into question" greece's territorial
rights.
</P>
<P>
With regard to Cyprus, a resolution was adopted calling the
Cyprus issue one of "invasion and occupation" of a sector of an
independent member-state of the united nations and thus an
international problem. It expressed opposition to any mediation by
the United States, stressing that even European Union efforts
should not detract from the international character of the
problem. The only possible solution, it added, was one based on
securing the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence
of the Cypriot Republic.
</P>
<P>
The conference, first of its kind in the region, was organized
by the Greek Peace Organization and was attended by delegates from
peace groups in Albania, Cyprus, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Romania and
the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia.

<HEADLINE> Coronation For Traditional Ruler Held In Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The coronation for one of
Uganda's traditional rulers, Busoga King Henry Wako Muloki, was
held today in Jinja, a town 80 kilometers east of Kampala.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people attended the grand ceremony which was
characterized by lively music and dancing by the local cultural
groups, punctuated by loud cheering.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was performed by Archbishop Livingstone Nkoyooyo
who placed the royal crown on the head of the king.
</P>
<P>
A shield and spear were afterwards presented to the king as
symbols to shield him from harm and for him to defend himself.
</P>
<P>
In his coronation address, Muloki said that the five most
important factors in developing Uganda were agriculture,
education, industrialization, order and unity.
</P>
<P>
He therefore pledged himself to work painstakingly for the
welfare of Busoga and the whole Uganda.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the function, Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni said that he personally supported the restoration of
cultural institutions because they helped Ugandans discover their
cultural ones.
</P>
<P>
He said these institutions were very useful provided they kept
updating themselves and did not become archaic.
</P>
<P>
Delegations from other traditional institutions included the
King of Bunyoro Solomon Iguru Rukirabaa Saija, Prince Karamagi
and Princess Elizabeth Bagaayo of Toro Kingdom, Prince John
Bariye of Ankore Kingdom and Prime Minister of Buganda Kingdom
Simogerere who represented the King.
</P>
<P>
The function was also attended by the Vice-President Specioza
Kazibwe, cabinet ministers, members of the diplomatic corps.
</P>
<P>
There existed five kingdoms in Uganda, namely Buganda, Toro,
Bunyoro, Busoga and Ankole, before the monarchical system was
abolished in 1966.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993 the four traditional coronation ceremonies have
been held in the country, namely those of Buganda, Bunyoro, Toro
and Busoga.
</P>
<P>
The coronation of Ankole King though was held in 1993 but was
not recognized by the country's government.
</P>
<P>
According to the constitutional amendment statute 1993, these
Kings acting as traditional and cultural leaders are not allowed
to play political and administrative role in the country.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Premier Announces Early Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Shimon Peres tonight officially announced his decision to bring
forward the Israeli general elections, which were originally
scheduled for October 29.
</P>
<P>
Peres, who is also the chairman of the Labor party, made the
announcement in Jerusalem at a press conference, which was being
broadcasted nationwide by Israeli Television channels One and
Two.
</P>
<P>
Explaining why he wanted to advance the Knesset (Israel's
parliament) elections, Peres said that the whole country was
already in fact involved in an election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Peres reiterated that the peace process will
continue and decision of holding early elections in Israel will
not affect the undergoing peace negotiations with Syria in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Peres met with representatives of Meretz, a
member of the coalition government, in an effort to win support
for the decision to call for early elections.
</P>
<P>
Meretz, who was not eager to go to early elections, found it
politically difficult to oppose Peres, and its leader Yossi Sarid
said that his party would "try to help" the Labor party.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ra'anan Cohen, chairman of the Labor Knesset
faction, held a series of talks today with leaders of Hadash and
the Democratic Arab Party (DAP), in an attempt to get a blocking
majority, leaving the opposition parties with no choice.
</P>
<P>
Both the Hadash and the DAP noted, after consultations with
the Cohen, that they will support Peres's decision to call for
early elections, while, the Third Way leader Avigdor Kahalani,
who broke away from the Labor party, also promised to vote in
favor of an early election bill.
</P>
<P>
With a majority in the back, Cohen now will present a bill to
the Knesset Tuesday to dissolve the 13th Knesset and set for the
new election date.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media reported lately that May 28 is Labor's target
date, the party's strategy may be to bargain with other factions
by first suggesting May 21 and then "compromising" on May 28.
</P>
<P>
However, Sarid, who is the minister of environment in the
coalition government, told Israel Television, following his
meeting with Peres this morning, that the prime minister appeared
to be leading to June 4.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Greece's armed forces will be
observing from a discreet distance the sea and air exercise by
Turkish forces in the Aegean's international waters, sources from
the country's defense ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
The exercise, which begins tomorrow, has been planned before
the recent Greek-Turkish crisis began.
</P>
<P>
The sources said specific instructions have been given in the
event that Greece's air or sea space is violated.
</P>
<P>
Greek Defense Minister Gerasimos Arsenis stated Saturday that
the Greek public should be briefed only by the proper government
sources on the matter and not by circles outside the country.
</P>
<P>
The minister dismissed NATO's concern that Greece and Turkey
are heading for another military stand-off in the Aegean.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country's defense undersecretary Nikos Kouris
said that any Turkish provocations could well be part of a plan to
wage psychological warfare, a possibility the Greek forces would
confront with self-restraint.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Youth Invents Gadget to Prevent Gas Leakage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT, February 11 (Xinhua) -- A Saudi Arabian young man has
invented a gadget to be installed in a gas bottle valve to guard
against leakage.
</P>
<P>
The inventor, Osama Ahmed Amin Klintin, a student at King
Abdul-Aziz University in Jeddah, has disclosed that the idea of
the gadget is based on a gas detector fixed with an electric
circuit and an electric motor.
</P>
<P>
In case of gas leakage from the bottle, he added, the detector
will send a signal to the electric motor which in turn will firmly
close the valve of the gas bottle and promptly disconnect the
electric current.
</P>
<P>
The young inventor, in an interview with the Saudi Arabian
newspaper Al Madina published today, said the cost of the
apparatus is little but it is quite useful, particularly because
the leakage of gas does claim the lives of many people, and may
thus be considered as a means to save lives and properties.

<HEADLINE> Ireland Criticizes Britain over Election Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister John
Bruton today accused Britain of "pouring petrol on the flames"
licking at the peace process in Northern Ireland by insisting on
elections in the province ahead of all-party talks.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to remarks by Patrick Mayhew, Britain's Northern
Ireland secretary, Bruton said the British position on elections
would only deepen the current crisis into which the peace process
had been plunged by a lethal IRA bomb attack in London on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the idea of having an election of the kind
suggested immediately after the resumption of violence would pour
petrol on the flames," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mayhew, while reiterating Britain would not talk to Sinn Fein
before violence threat ended, insisted that elections, proposed by
John Major last month, must be the next step in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said that Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, should view
elections as a "door, not an obstacle" to ending the conflict.
</P>
<P>
In his remarks, Bruton also accused Britain of wasting time by
asking Sinn Fein to condemn the bomb attack publicly to earn any
right to continue the talks with the government.
</P>
<P>
Instead, he said, "we should concentrate on the main goal,
which is stopping the violence now, getting them and the IRA to
say they are stopping the killing," he said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that his government would not hold talks with
Sinn Fein until the IRA ceasefire was reinstated.

<HEADLINE> UK Official Says No Talks with Sinn Fein  Before Violence Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Britain reiterated today that
it would not talk to Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish
Republican Army, so long as the threat of more IRA violence hung
over the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Patrick Mayhew, Britain's Northern Ireland secretary, said in
TV interviews that although the peace process has been seriously
damaged by the IRA bomb blast on Friday, Britain would still try
"to keep it going".
</P>
<P>
But he insisted that the holding of all-party talks, which is
Sinn Fein's goal, was now impossible because no party would
negotiate with one which had armed supporters.
</P>
<P>
"You won't get people sitting round the table...with people who
are associated inextricably with people who are prepared to do
that (let off bombs)," he said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that elections must be the next step in the
Northern Ireland peace process and that they could be held very
soon.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein should view elections as a "door, not an obstacle" to
ending the conflict, he said.
</P>
<P>
Its participation in the elections would show a commitment to
democratic and peaceful means, giving it a mandate for taking part
in all-party talks, he added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Israel Busy Preparing for Early Elections (Part II) (by Huai Chengbo) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Likud and another major opposition party of
Tsomet on Thursday initialed agreement on establishing a unified
bloc for the elections. They will be fielding a single Knesset
ticket and both back Netanyahu for premier. Netanyahu said the
agreement heralds what he called "a new era."
</P>
<P>
According to Netanyahu, "The choice now is between the left --
which will withdraw from every centimeter of the Golan, cause the
redivision of Jerusalem, and create a Palestinian state next to
Israel's densest population centers -- and the national camp,
which will leave the Golan in Israel's hands prevent any division
of Jerusalem, and allow only Arab self-rule in some locations, but
not a Palestinian state."
</P>
<P>
In a bid to adapt the Likud to the reality created by the Oslo
agreements, Netanyahu at first put forward some proposals to
adjust the party's platform, only to find that those old guards of
his party would not accept any change. Then he backed down and
declared that he will not personally meet or deal with PLO
Chairman Yasser Arafat if he is elected prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"If the Palestinian Authority meets basic conditions, such as
giving up its aim of destroying Israel and ceasing to support
terrorism, then I will have my people deal with the PA," he said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu argued, "Leadership is the fusion between ideology
and reality. We are inheriting a reality which none of us wanted,
but with which we shall have to cope."
</P>
<P>
The Likud-Tsomet alliance has the remaining opposition parties
looking hard at one another to see if they, too, can join
together in some kind of political tango.
</P>
<P>
Zevulun Orlev, political secretary of the National Religious
Party (NRP), said he is "very supportive" of a united religious
front that would include the NRP, Shas, Agudat Yisrael, and Degel
Hatorah. The unifying feature of such a front, he said, "is the
government's negative attitude to Judaism."
</P>
<P>
Unification, one way or another, of various parties
representing some 750,000 Palestinians and other arab communities
in Israel has also been brewing for some time. The Israel Arab
Progressive Movement for Peace party (PMP) has decided to join
forces with the proposed new Arab Movement for Change Party led by
Ahmed Tibi to run in the elections.
</P>
<P>
Tibi, senior adviser to Arafat, described the move as "a very
important step" in his efforts to forge a large Arab bloc to run
in the elections. His movement, set to be declared a party next
month, is also in contact with groups in the Israeli sector.
</P>
<P>
The Arab population constitutes a formidable backbone for the
Labor-led government's policy of peace with the PLO.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Israel Busy Preparing for Early Elections (Part I) (by Huai Chengbo) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Shimon Peres is due to announce this evening to move up general
elections from October 29 to late May or early June, a move that
will officially usher in an electioneering process in the country.
</P>
<P>
The idea to hold early elections emerged shortly after late
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated at the end of a
peace rally in Tel Aviv on the night of November 4. Senior Labor
officials urged Peres to take the advantage of the ensuing soaring
rate of public support for the government and peace process to
make such a decision, the sooner the better.
</P>
<P>
Peres deliberately withheld the decision until after the 17th
round of shuttle peace mission conducted by U.S. Secretary of
State Warren Christopher between Israel and Syria. Should a major
breakthrough be foreseeable, Peres would have maintained the
original schedule.
</P>
<P>
Binyamin Netanyahu, chairman of the major opposition party of
Likud, charged that Peres is in a rush precisely in order to
effect a political hijacking and maximize the boost Labor got
after Rabin's assassination. He added that Peres "wants to
reschedule the elections because he is worried by the narrowing
gap in the polls."
</P>
<P>
According to a poll published on February 2, Peres held a
strong lead over Netanyahu by 20 percent. The poll, conducted by
Yediot Aharonot, Israel's largest newspaper in circulation,
showed that Peres would receive 46 percent of the votes if
elections for prime minister were held now. His Labor Party would
control 48 seats in the Knesset, four more than it does now. The
Likud would garner 37 seats.
</P>
<P>
However, Peres categorically denied suggestions that by calling
early elections he might be perceived as "cashing in" on the wave
of support for Labor following the assassination of Rabin.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference at the end of his two-day visit to
Britain last week that he would prefer to see the government
continue until its term ends in late October, but "there are some
considerations, not connected with the peace process," which
incline him to early elections.
</P>
<P>
"We have to have a new mandate because this government exists
as a result of a tragic event. Just as a bullet cannot stop the
democratic process, it cannot justify an extension of the
mandate," Peres explained. "There were other unspecified economic
and political considerations" which might make early elections
necessary.
</P>
<P>
For quite some time now, intensive and extensive activities
have been carried out to prepare for the elections by various
parties. A special team was set up last week by Peres to deal with
all aspects of holding early elections.
</P>
<P>
The team includes Public Security Minister Moshe Shahal,
Interior Minister Haim Ramon, Justice Minister David liba'i, Labor
Party Secretary-General Nissim Zvilli and Knesset faction chairman
Ra'anan Cohen. Former Tel Aviv mayor Shlomo Lahat was also called
to join the electoral campaign in an undefined function.
</P>
<P>
Practical preparations were under way in Labor
headquarters. These included advancing the party's Knesset
primaries from June to April 17 and again to March 25, one day
ahead of the date the Likud had long slated for its primaries.
</P>
<P>
Zvilli ordered generous overtime allotments to ensure that the
bureaucratic groundwork for the primaries is completed by an
earlier than envisioned target date. Early elections fever has
extended beyond the primaries with a hectic activity to prepare
the infrastructure for the campaign itself.
</P>
<P>
"Everything is all ready for the race. All that is needed now
is the firing of the starting pistol," Cohen declared.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Has Easy Home Win Over Shenyang Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Shan Tao scored a game high 21
points to lead host Beijing Shougang to an easy 83-55 win over
Shenyang Army in the 18th round of the Chinese Men's Basketball
League here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Beijing dominated the game, leading the visiting team 23-4 only
seven minutes into the action. Shenyang Army, pressed by the 2.15
meters center Shan and 2.10 meters forward Bater, made too many
errors and trailed 24-49 in the first half.
</P>
<P>
The Shenyang Army rallied hard in the second half and managed
to narrow the gap to 18 points after Shan was replaced by a
teammate. But that was not enough for the Shenyang Army team to
turn the tide around.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Chao, head coach of the Beijing team, was satisfied with
his players's performance.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody were in high spirits in the court," Yuan said. "They
really played a good game."
</P>
<P>
Beijing now stood third in the team standings with a win and
loss record of 15-3, while Shenyang Army was in the sixth with
7-11.
</P>
<P>
Shenyang Army's head coach Xuan Chengbin said they should not
have lost the match by such a big margin, considering the strength
between the two teams.
</P>
<P>
"The main reason is that the players were mentally so weak in
an away match," Xuan said.
</P>
<P>
In the day's other matches, Jinan Army, with Liu Yong's 32
points, stunned Shandong in Qingdao 87-65.
</P>
<P>
In Hefei, defending champion August First outpointed Nanjing
Army 95-79 to maintain its unbeaten record in the league.
</P>
<P>
The dismay continued to link with Vanguard as the police team
lost to Jiangsu 69-93 in Tianjin. Vanguard now is at the bottom
of the standings with only one win after 18 rounds.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong Hongyuan downed Air Force 83-71 in Wuhan.

<HEADLINE> Parasite of Snake Found in Human Body </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Physicians at a hospital in
this capital city of east China's Zhejiang Province have found a
kind of parasite of snake in a patient's intestines.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time in the world that armillifer
agkistrodontis, or the parasite, was found in human body, said
Zhang Qiyu, head of the medical department of Zhejiang Medical
University's Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital.
</P>
<P>
He explained that doctors at the hospital observed eggs and
bodies of the worms under the intestinal mucosa through intestinal
probe (scopsy) and biopsy, after a liver puncture had ruled out
the possibility of liver cancer.
</P>
<P>
Before he came to the hospital last November, the patient had
been suspected of having liver cancer, due to the fact that he had
been suffering from a lasting fever, stomachache and diarrhona for
three months, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the cause for the disease may be that the patient
had been keen on eating snake gallbladders and drinking snake
blood in recent years. In south China, people believe that those
things are helpful in relieving the body's internal heat or fever.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that the disease caused by the worms are easily made
wrong diagnosis as hepatitis, intestinal ailment or blood disease,
and the hospital is now inviting specialists to make further study
of the disease together.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Leaders Continue Efforts for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Top Afghan leaders continued
to discuss here today the peaceful solution for their war-battered
country for the second day.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held between Rashid Dostum, chief of
Junbush-i-Melli, and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, former Afghan prime
minister and chief of Hezb-i-Islami (Hekmatyar Group).
</P>
<P>
Deputy chief of Hezb-i-Wahdat (Khalili Group) Ustad Muhaqqiq,
and former Afghan president and chairman of Nejat-i-Melli
Sibghatollah Mojadeddi also attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The four leaders from Afghan opposition coalition discussed
possibilities to create peace and a broad-based interim government
in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
A 28-member council proposed by the UN special envoy on
Afghanistan, Mehmud Mestiri, last November was also under
discussion.
</P>
<P>
The opposition alliance maintained that the only way out of the
present crisis was an neutral government and the resignation of
President Burhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
A new grand alliance of all Afghan opposition groups was
proposed during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"There is a proposal for the formation of a grand front to
unite all opposition groups including Taliban against the Rabbani
regime," said Afghan sources.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to contact Taliban and we hope they will side
with us," the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Taliban, a loose organization of Islamic students which burst
into prominence some 18 months ago, has so far distanced itself
from other opposition groups trying to topple the Kabul regime.
</P>
<P>
"The proposed grand alliance is meant to build up pressure on
Rabbani to quit power. Otherwise any possible action can be taken
against him," the Afghan sources said.
</P>
<P>
Specifying the "possible action," the sources said, "then he
will be forced to quit."
</P>
<P>
The Afghan leaders have been here since last Tuesday to discuss
peace initiatives among each other and with Mestiri, Pakistani
officials and Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Allauddin Broujerdi,
who also paid a visit to Islamabad last Thursday.

<HEADLINE> CYLC, ACSF Help Poor Students with Grant-in-Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Central Committee of the
Communist Youth League of China (CYLC) and All-China Students
Federation (ACSF) have sent out the first amount of grant-in-aid,
totaling 400,000 yuan to 630 extremely poor students by the end of
last month.
</P>
<P>
The CYLC first secretary Li Keqiang, the executive secretary
Liu Peng and other leaders granted the aid to the poor in Beijing,
Chongqing, Chengdu, Xi'an and Urumqi, the capital city of Uygur
Autonomous Region of Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that about 15 percent of college students in
the country are impoverished. And seven percent of those are
extremely poor, due to the poverty of their families and the lack
of personal income.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the State has granted 117 million yuan from
the Premier Fund to aid the extremely poor students, and measures
have been taken to help the poor in universities and colleges.
</P>
<P>
The first amount of grant-in-aid was warmly welcomed by the
receivers, according to officials with CYLC.
</P>
<P>
"The money is such a timely help," said a Uygur student at
Xinjiang Medical College, holding 600 yuan of grant-in-aid in his
hands, "because I want to apply for the postgraduate study after
my graduation this July."
</P>
<P>
He said that after he finished his college studies, he would
return to his homeland Pishan, a small County in Uygur Autonomous
Region of Xinjiang, to contribute in the medical care of his
people.

<HEADLINE> AFC Soccer Official Supports Ban on Corrupt Malaysians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Asian Football
Confederation official Peter Velappan supported the three
Southeast Asian associations' plans to bar Malaysian players who
have been suspended for match-fixing, from their countries.
</P>
<P>
"This is a good lesson for these players to show that bribery
does not pay," said Velappan, general-secretary of the AFC, adding
such a ban would deter other players in Asia, especially
Southeast-Asia.
</P>
<P>
"Such players should be totally excluded from the game as
football can do without them," he said, adding that a suspension
could also be extended worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The Football Associations of Singapore, Thailand and Indonesia
said in Kuala Lumpur Saturday they would not hire the 58 Malaysian
players at the end of their suspensions for fixing matches.
</P>
<P>
The rejection was the second blow to 15 of the 58 players whose
suspensions end next month and in July after the FA of Malaysia
(FAM) executive committee said on Wednesday it would take five to
seven years to study their appeals.

<HEADLINE> Holbrooke Arrives in Sarajevo to Salvage Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, February 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. mediator Richard
Holbrooke arrived here today in an effort to make the rival
factions in Bosnia to abide by the Dayton peace accord without
exception.
</P>
<P>
"The president has asked us to come back to deal with the
issues arising from recent events...and we will see that we can
ease the tensions, " Holbrooke, who brokered the Dayton agreement
to end the 43-month war in Bosnia, said at the Sarajevo airport.
</P>
<P>
Holbrook was ordered back to defuse a crisis evolved from the
detention of two Serb army officers, General Djordje Djukic and
Colonel Aleska Krsmanovic, by the Bosnian government on charges of
war crimes.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first challenge of the Dayton agreement...we are
here to make sure that things are put on track, " Holbrooke told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian government has freed four of at least eight Bosnian
Serbs, including Djukic and Krsmanovic, whom they detained on
suspicion of committing war crimes.
</P>
<P>
Hours later, the Bosnian Serbs announced that they would resume
cooperation with NATO and Western mediators, but they refused to
hold talks with the Bosnian authorities.
</P>
<P>
According to Holbrooke' plan, he will leave Sarajevo later
today for Zagreb and Belgrade to send a tough message to the
leaders of the Balkan country to rescue the fragile peace process
by defusing the crisis and complying with the Dayton accord.

<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Tommi Makinen of Finland
clinched the title of the world championship-opening Swedish Rally
in Karlstad, Sweden, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Makinen led almost throughout, keeping his Mitsubishi just
ahead of Carlos Sainz' Ford, even though he had to plough tracks
for his rivals through fresh snow.
</P>
<P>
Sainz produced one of the drives of the rally, harrying Makinen
on stages he had never driven at competitive speeds. He closed the
gap to 12 seconds and looked well-placed to snatch the lead but a
broken shock absorber on the last stage forced him to settle for
second.
</P>
<P>
World champion Colin McRae of Britain was third, recovering
strongly from tyre problems and a minor accident at the start of
the rally.
</P>
<P>
Finn Juha Kankkunen had to settle for fourth with his Toyota
no match for McRae's Subaru in the snow.
</P>
<P>
Former world champion Ari Vatanen escaped unhurt when he
crashed his Ford at almost 200 kph when battling Swede Kenneth
Eriksson for fifth place.
</P>
<P>
The next round of the world championship is Kenya's Safari
Rally in April.

hat-trick as European championship finalist Romania defeated
Thailand 3-0 on the second day of the four-team King's Cup soccer

Romania now leads the standings with four points from two

Romania shocked the Thais and the home crowd with a quick goal
just two minutes into the game. Mugurel pounced on a ball
deflected from a corner kick and rammed it home past goalkeeper
Wacharapong Somcit.
</P>
<P>
The Thais tried hard to counter attack and came close to
scoring in the 25th and 34th minutes but were foiled by a stout
Romanian defence.
</P>
<P>
In the second half Romania made two changes, bringing in Julin
Filipesco for Radu Niculescu and Ion Vladoiu for Ionel
Danciulescu and giving the team a lift.
</P>
<P>
Mugurel rushed in from the right flank in the 61st minute and
scored from 22 meters as the hapless Thai defenders watched. He
then wrapped up the match with the final goal in the 83rd minute
from close range after outmanoeuvring the Thai defenders.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has denied any involvement
in efforts to topple the Iraqi regime, the English-language
daily, Jordan Times, reported today.
</P>
<P>
Marwan Muasher, Jordan's information minister, told reporters
Saturday night after a cabinet meeting that "Jordan doesn't have
any plan to topple any of the regimes in the region."
</P>
<P>
"What is of interest to us is the unity of Iraq and
alleviating the suffering of the Iraqi people," the daily quoted
him as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We have always insisted on and called for the unity of Iraq,"
he said, commenting on the U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry's
speech in the Washington Institute for Foreign Policy on
Tuesday. Perry said the U.S. and Jordan were cooperating to
accelerate the demise of Iraqi President Hussein Saddam from power.
</P>
<P>
But Perry did not give details of the purported actions.
</P>
<P>
However, the Jordanian information minister said Thursday that
Jordan supports all efforts aimed at alleviating the suffering of
the Iraqi people and is in contact with all parties, particularly
Arab countries, to help such endeavors.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Perry's assertions, Muasher only said that
"Jordan's policy vis-a-vis Iraq has not changed" and that the
Kingdom fully respectes the unity, territorial integrity and
sovereignty of its eastern neighbor.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the contradictory words of the
information minister indicated a major shift of Jordan's foreign
policy toward Iraq, aimed at pacifying the dissatisfaction from
Arab countries, especially from Egypt and Saudi Arabia.

King Hussein started his visit to Saudi Arabia today and

<HEADLINE> China to Raise Localization Rate of Nuclear Power Facilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 11 (Xinhua) -- China is making efforts to
increase the localization of the design and manufacturing of
nuclear power equipment.
</P>
<P>
The country will be able to self-design 300,000 kw and 600,000
kw nuclear power plants at the end of this century, according to a
report by the China Electric Power News.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country will have the capacity to design one
million kw nuclear power plants mainly by itself and at the same
time by referring to foreign experts or jointly undertaking
nuclear power projects with foreigners.
</P>
<P>
China has accumulated experience in the construction of the
Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant first and second phase, the
manufacturing of equipment for Pakistan's Chashma Nuclear Power
Plant, and will make more research in the Ninth Five-Year Plan
period (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
In terms of manufacturing, it is expected that by the end of
this century, the country can produce whole sets of equipment for
300,000 kw nuclear power units, and about 80 percent of the
equipment for nuclear power plants with an installed capacity from
600,000 kw to one million kw, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, the country has spent a great deal on
introducing foreign technology and equipment for nuclear power
development in a bid to ease the country's shortage of energy
supply.

KUNMING, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Most of the banks and
insurance companies in the area of southwest China's Yunnan
Province that was hit by a strong earthquake early this month have
been back to service from Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 7.0-magnitude earthquake shocked over 5 million people in
four prefectures of the province, killing or injuring more than
14,000 people and smashing over 340,000 houses of the region.
</P>
<P>
According to an official from the Yunnan Branch of the People's
Bank of China, the central bank, when the earthquake began,
hundreds of million yuan-worth of cash and various kinds of bills
were storing in over 500 business spots for financial institutions
in the area.
</P>
<P>
Not a single penny was lost after the quake, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The residents of the area, mostly from national minority
groups, are kind and happy to help others, and the social security
condition there is very good, the official explained.
</P>
<P>
Since aftershocks are still possible, banks and insurance
companies have to conduct business in temporary sheds or in
streets. But everything is in good order.
</P>
<P>
It is also reported that immediately after the earthquake, many
 employees of the financial institutions went back to their

<HEADLINE> Political Feature - News Analysis: Poll To Give Way To Peace-making In Post-Coup S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Guo Ming
</P>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Peace or poll ? That's the
question for today's war-stricken Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The presidential elections are scheduled for February 26.
</P>
<P>
But on Saturday night, the government led by Brigadier Julius
Maada Bio, who came to power in a January 16 military coup,
struck a deal with the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) to
hold ceasefire negotiations on February 28.
</P>
<P>
The face-to-face peace talks, the first ever in the west
African state since the beginning of its civil war in 1991, are
scheduled in the Cote d'Ivoire city of Yamousoukro.
</P>
<P>
"The wartime poll is set to be delayed until the coup leaders
in power bring peace to the country," said a source close to the
military.
</P>
<P>
A former West African peacekeeping officer in Liberia, Bio,
immediately after he came to power after ousting former Head of
State Captain Valentine Strasser, waged a full-fledged "campaign"
to make peace with Foday Sankoh's RUF rebels.
</P>
<P>
During the last three weeks, Bio has shuttled several
influential sub-regional states, including Nigeria, Guinea,
Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, Guinea and Ghana have deployed their 1,000 strong
West African peacekeeping forces in Sierra Leone, while Cote
d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso are reported to have close links with
the RUF rebels.
</P>
<P>
Western envoys in Freetown called Bio's diplomatic moves,
which resulted in the forthcoming peace talks between him and
Sankoh, as "a great relief".
</P>
<P>
And African diplomats hailed "peace is in sight" for the
country torn apart by the civil war which was started by Sankoh
with the original aim of toppling Joseph Momoh's corrupt
government.
</P>
<P>
Momoh's overthrow in 1992 in a military coup led by Captain
Strasser, did not put an end to the war as the RUF accused
Strasser of displaying no sincerity for peace talks.
</P>
<P>
But this time, everything indicated that Bio, widely dubbed by
the local media as "a cool, brave and far-sighted leader", is
determined to end the five-year-old civil war which so far has
killed 100,000 people and displaced half Sierra Leone's 4.2
million population.
</P>
<P>
"Our prime task is to install peace in the country," said an
official statement issued by Bio's spokesman immediately after
the January 16 coup.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources say the Bio-led coup exactly reflected
the military's reluctance of handing over power at war time.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sankoh rejected any ceasefire before the scheduled
peace talks because of "the military condition prevailing".
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to have a ceasefire, and an everlasting peace
after February, but not now," said the rebel leader.
</P>
<P>
In another development, both the headquarters of Sierra
Leone's Electoral Commission and the residence of its chairman,
James Jonah, were bombed by unidentified gunmen on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Nobody was hurt in the attacks, but Jonah, former Assistant
Secretary-General of the United Nations, linked them to his
outspoken support for the holding of the civil-rule elections as
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
"There are people who are afraid of letting me speak at next
week's Consultative Conference for the holding of elections on
February 26," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the past week, the RUF rebels, following repeated vows to
"disrupt the February 26 elections if held", waged a series of
attacks in the eastern and northern parts of the country, killing
scores of people, mostly civilians.
</P>
<P>
Three presidential candidates, while campaigning, were also
held for a couple of hours on Tuesday and released later by the RUF rebels.
</P>
<P>
"With the five-year-old rebel fighting still hanging on,
what's the sense of holding the elections?" an African diplomat
doubted.
</P>
<P>
Jonah's Electoral Commission also repeatedly complained about
poor preparation for the February 26 poll, citing the hardship of
registering voters due to the rebel fighting which displaced two
million Sierra Leoneans and forced 100,000 refugees in exile.
</P>
<P>
"The (election) date is not realistic," Bio, on the second day
of his coup, raised the point.
</P>
<P>
Despite Bio's claim that his government would not postpone the
poll before consulting the public, observers say there would be
no elections if a peace deal is not struck with the RUF which
commands 20,000 rebel troops.
</P>
<P>
"All these developments casted doubts on the February 26
presidential elections," said a source close to the Bio
administration.
</P>
<P>
"Let's smile and wait. The poll will be coming after a peace
deal," he said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Pleads with IMF to Reopen Industrial Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is strongly
pleading with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reopen its
12 Special Industrial Zones (SIZ), said Secretary of Pakistan's
Board of Investment (BOI) Syed Mohibullah Shah here today.
</P>
<P>
Talking to the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP), he said the
SIZs attracted over two billion US dollars as direct foreign
investment within eight months.
</P>
<P>
The SIZ scheme, if not phased out, he said, could attract over
15 billion dollars within five years as direct foreign investment
in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He said, had the SIZs continued for five consecutive years, it
would have opened the window of growth for Pakistan, resulting in
transfer of technology, creation of thousands of job
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
It would also widen industrial base besides substantially
increasing export production to earn more foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
"We are strongly pleading with the IMF to open the window of
growth for Pakistan through Special Industrial Zones," he said.
</P>
<P>
An IMF team is currently visiting Pakistan to study the
country's economic performances in various sectors.
</P>
<P>
The SIZ scheme was introduced by BOI in a bid to make
Pakistan's industry competitive in the international market and to
bring the country out of "spinning age", enabling it to face the
economic challenges of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The scheme ensured certain incentives and concessions to reduce
the cost of production in Pakistan so that they could compete at
the international level.
</P>
<P>
However, the incentives and concessions given to the 12 SIZs
located all over the country were withdrawn last month by the
government under the IMF pressure to widen taxation base and
improve the country's revenue.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Version of "The Road Ahead" Hits China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The simplified Chinese
character version of the U.S computer genius Bill Gates' book,
"The Road Ahead", becomes a new hit in China at the beginning of
this year, with 200,000 copies having been sold.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wending, deputy editor-in-chief of the Beijing University
Press which published the book, said that the book's sales might
top 600,000 copies, with its simplified Chinese character version
royalty income estimated to be one million yuan.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that the Microsoft company had estimated that the
book's sales might create a record of one million copies before it
was published in China.
</P>
<P>
But it is still too optimistic, Zhang said, only time can tell
the final figure.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, the sales of U.S Chrysler's president
I.A.Iacocca's autobiography made a record of 1.2 million copies on
the Chinese market. Since then, however, Chinese readers have not
shown the same enthusiasm to any other world-known business
leaders' books.
</P>
<P>
A literature critic here comments that Gates' book describes
what our future world is like, and it is really attractive to
those people who can hear the words like "information age" and
"information super highway" every day.
</P>
<P>
The book now are quite popular among young people, computer
company employees, and government officials.
</P>
<P>
A local computer company bought 300 copies of the book for its
employees on January 10, the first day the book was published. And
the company will sponsor a seminar on the book here in March.

LONDON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Political leaders in Britain,
Ireland and the United States are desperately trying to rescue the
peace process in Northern Ireland after an IRA bomb blasted
London's Docklands commercial area on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister John Major summoned senior ministers
to an emergency meeting at Downing Street Saturday night to assess
whether the Bomb was an aberration or meant a total ceasefire
breakdown.
</P>
<P>
Major issued a statement Saturday declaring that the will of

resuming terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
"The IRA and Sinn Fein must say now that their campaign of
violence has stopped, and they will never resume it," he said.

<P>
The Irish government reacted furiously to the IRA's end of
ceasfire which started in August, 1994, declaring that it would
not meet Sinn Fein again until peace was restored.
</P>
<P>
A meeting between Major and his Irish counterpart, John Bruton,
scheduled for later this month, is expected to be Brought forward,

National Security Adviser, and Senator Goerge Mitchell, who
headed a recent commission on disarmament in Northern
Ireland, to Belfast to offer the peace process American
assistance.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said Saturday that he was determined to do all he could
to keep the peace process continuing.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Scientist Finds Vitamin C Conducive To Skin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli researchers have
found that vitamin C is good for the skin, the Jerusalem Post
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Vitamin C helps heal wounds, reduces wrinkles and may even cut
the risk of skin cancers caused by ultra-violet radiation,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
However, taking ascorbic acid, as it is known chemically,
by mouth is not the best way to take advantage of these
properties. A topical cream that introduces the vitamin directly
into the epidermis is the best idea.

Dr. Yitzhak Shalkovitz-Shilo, a dermatology specialist at Kupat
Holim Clalit's Tel Nordau clinic in Tel Aviv, said that it
was impossible until recently to produce a vitamin-C skin cream
that was stable and because it oxidizes in a wet environment.
</P>
<P>
Writing in the latest issue of Merkahton Livriut, published
by the Israel Pharmacists' Association and Clalit, the
dermatologist reports that a topical skin product containing the
vitamin C minimizes the damage caused to skin by oxygen free
radicals.
</P>
<P>
"Based on this information, it can be supposed that using
vitamin-C cream on the skin is helpful in dealing with sun
damage and the resulting aging of the skin.... There should not
be any contraindications for this use," he concludes.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Manila to Tap Internet for Export Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
tap the Internet, the global computer link, for the country's
aggressive export drive.
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry Undersecretary Cesar Bautista said over the
weekend that the Internet access to the Philippine Trade and
Investment Information Network System (Phil-TINS) will be
finalized within the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Internet link could carry information about
Philippine products and suppliers to thousands of prospective
importers and buyers.
</P>
<P>
This will back a campaign aimed at achieving some 21 billion US
dollars in export revenues this year, he added.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to an aggressive promotion strategy, the country's trade
deficit dropped from four billion US dollars in 1994 to 1.4
billion dollars in 1995, the lowest in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Export receipts, targeted to hit 16 billion dollars for the
whole of 1995, actually reached 17.4 billion dollars, up 29
percent from the previous year's 13.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
With the link of the Phil-TINS and Internet, Philippine
exporters will be able to identify markets for their products and
accept queries from interested foreign buyers.
</P>
<P>
Launched last September, the Phil-TINS consists of trade and
investment information that can be retrieved electronically.
</P>
<P>
The information includes market guides, product profiles, trade
opportunity reports and electronic-mail addresses of Philippine
commercial offices overseas and key trade officials.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Board of Investments wired a page in the world
wide web last September to woo prospective investors.
</P>
<P>
The government agency plans to launch additional web pages this
year, which will include specific information on the costs of
doing business in a particular region, support industries in the
area, the size of the local workforce and existing infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Since December 1994, the Garment and Textile Export Board,
another government agency, has been dealing with garment exporters
for quotas and export and import requirements through the GTEBnet.

LAGOS, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government is to
support West African Peace-Keeping Force in Liberia known as
ECOMOG with military equipment and facilities worth 10 million
dollars, says a report received here today.
</P>
<P>
U.S. assistance has already begun with the release of 230,000
dollars for movement of 1,000 ECOMOG troops with ammunition,
trucks, and other supplies.
</P>
<P>
The assistance will cover a period of 12 months, dependable

HONG KONG, February 11 (Xinhua) -- A 13-year-old school boy was
found alive on the hill-fire site on Pat Sing Leng Country Park in
the New Territories this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The boy, one of 54 students and teachers trapped in the killer
fire Saturday, was supposed to be dead before he was found at 1:00
PM today.
</P>
<P>
He was found conscious in a search operation for a missing
teacher and he was sent to the Prince of Wales Hospital
immediately.
</P>

Sources from the hospital said this evening that the boy was
not in critical condition. He could speak while he was sent to
the hospital.
</P>
<P>
The blaze which broke out at 11:30 am Saturday and was
extinguished at 1:00 am today has claimed the lives of three
students and a female teacher.
</P>
<P>
One male teacher, Chow Chi-chai, is still missing. The two
teachers had given their lives to save the teenagers trapped in
the fire, local media reported.

<HEADLINE> Food Aid For Pemba Islanders Mobilized By Zanzibar Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Zanzibar government
has hailed the move by the main opposition Civic United Front
(CUF) to rush relief food to starving people on the Twin-island
of Pemba.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Chief Minister Omar Ramadhan Mapuri told a press
conference in the town of Zanzibar on Saturday that the food
haulage, which begins today, would greatly alleviate the
suffering of the islanders, who had been facing food scarcity for
more than a month.
</P>
<P>
He said he was heartened by CUF's move to ship food to Pemba.
The move was a good example of co-operation in the new multiparty
system, he added.
</P>
<P>
Mapuri dismissed claims that CUF's action would erode the
grovernment's credibility, saying it was the responsibility of
opposition parties to assist the government of the day to resolve
the population's problems.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that no one had died since food scarcity struck
the island, adding that the situation was not as grave as to
force the government to panic and start seeking food assistance.
</P>
<P>
He attributed food scarcity in Pemba to drought. The fact that
some people abandoned agriculture to involve themselves in
politics also caused the decline in agricultural production, he
addeed.
</P>
<P>
About 3,800 U.S. Dollars, 100 bags of rice and 10 bags of
beans were promised at a meeting here Friday at which CUF
mobilized food assistance for PEMBA islanders.

<P>
AMMAN, February 11 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan left
here today for Riyadh for a two-day visit to Saudi Arabia
as part of the continuous efforts by Jordan to mend ties
with the Gulf Arab Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The king is expected to hold talks with Saudi king Fahd, Crown
Prince Abdullah and other senior Saudi officials.
</P>
<P>
Sources here said that the two monarchs will deal with
bilateral cooperation in economic, trade, cultural, military and
security fields.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti said earlier last week
that the two leaders will discuss the revival of joint committees
between the two kingdoms.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders are also expected to discuss the latest
developments in the Middle East peace process, which is fully
supported by Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The issue of Iraq will also be high on the two kings'
discussion. Local media reported that the two countries are in
agreement on Iraq's territorial integrity against its division,
but analysts here noted that Saudi Arabia has distanced itself
from Jordan's position on establishing a federation in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders will also have a detailed discussion on the
situation of thousands of Jordanians to work in Saudi Arabia,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
It is widely expected that king Hussein will ask Fahd to go
to Cairo to initiate a reconciliation process between Jordan and
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The king's visit to Saudi Arabia is to be within the context
of continued Jordanian moves following Crown Prince Hassan's
recent visit to Turkey and Morocco in a bid to strengthen its key
role in shaping the region.

<HEADLINE> Keating Fights Hard In First TV Debate (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the contrary, the opposition failed to tell the voters how
it would pay for the spending promises it made in the election
campaign, Keating said.
</P>
<P>
Howard refused to reveal where the money would be from, saying
he would announce the opposition's funding plan for election
commitments Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Howard ran into self-contradiction when he pressed Keating to
release the latest review of the budget, which is estimated to be
in deficit, and at the same time, based the opposition's spending
promises on the Labor Government's assessment that the budget is
in surplus.
</P>
<P>
Howard said that he regarded highly on the Federal Treasury's
budget assessment, implying that the opposition would not worry
about failing to meet its election pledges as long as the Labor
Government kept a budget deficit in secret.
</P>
<P>
But his argument failed to impress the audience because Keating
has announced that Labor's election commitments would be funded by
revenues from stricter tax compliance.
</P>
<P>
Keating said that crackdown on tax avoidance by wealthy
Australians and other savings measures would collect an additional
seven billion Australian dollars (5.25 billion US dollars) over
the next four years, while the Labor Government would spend an
extra 3.5 billion Australian dollars (2.6 billion US dollars) on
Medicare, roads, housing and airport noise abatement.
</P>
<P>
Keating won favorable response from the audience with the
arguments that the Labor Government had led Australia into a
modern industrialized country with sustainable economic growth,
low inflation rate and large employment growth.
</P>
<P>
Howard scored poorly as he refused to give up his position on
the sale of government-owned Telstra, the telecommunication
company that dominates domestic telephone market in Australia.
</P>
<P>
Howard said that he would use the money from the privatization
of Telstra to fund environmental projects. But the link of
environment with the highly controversial sale of Telstra seemed
not to be accepted by the audience.
</P>
<P>
However, Keating failed to score points on Medicare, one of the
issues that mark the biggest policy difference between the Labor
Party and the opposition coalition.
</P>
<P>
Keating's attack on Howard's caprice on issues of Medicare and
industrial relations appeared pale, when the audience accepted
Howard's argument that persons were eligible to change their views
over time.
</P>
<P>
The labor Party has trailed the opposition in public opinion
polls, with the majority of the people surveyed believing that the
opposition would win the election.
</P>
<P>
However, the elusiveness of the opposition in releasing its
election policies has given the Labor Party an edge, especially
after Keating announced the funding plan of Labor's election
commitments today.
</P>
<P>
The opposition has drawn lessons from defeat in previous
elections and tried to provide no target for Labor to attack by
keep its policies secret until February 18, two weeks before the
federal poll.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Labor Government, which has held federal
office for the past 13 years, is catching up with the opposition
in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
The 100 spectators at the Channel Nine studio tonight are yet
to make up their mind on whom they will vote for. Their favorable
response to Keating's performance will feed back into a large
number of uncommitted voters. Labor will rely on the swing of the
uncommitted voters to enlarge its support base and come from
behind to win the election.

<HEADLINE> Israel Heightens Security Alert Against Hamas Revenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli army and
security establishments have enhanced alert against possible
attacks by Islamic fundamentalist groups to mark the conclusion of
the 40-day mourning period for Yihye Ayyash and the end of the
holy month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
According to Israel Radio, the move came when the Islamic
Resistance Movement (Hamas) and Islamic Jihad are reportedly
planning a suicide attack on a crowded public bus in the center of
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Yigal Pressler, Israeli prime minister's advisor on terrorism,
has called on the Israeli public to be on look-out for suspicious
individuals or objects.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, thousands of Hamas supporters demonstrated in the
West Bank city of Nablus in memory of Ayyash, a Hamas activist
known as "The Engineer." He was killed in Gaza 40 days ago in an
explosion widely attributed to Israeli agents. Local Hamas
leaders have called for violent attacks against Israel to avenge
his death.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, some 240,000 Palestinians prayed peacefully at the
Temple Mount. Police units were deployed at the Temple Mount and
its surroundings in order to lower chances of incitement at the
mass prayers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pressler also warned the public to be especially
careful when visiting neighboring Jordan, suggesting they stick
to main roads, avoid routines and keep a low profile. Israelis
are advised not to visit tourist sites after dark, to fill
out hotel reception forms on-the-spot so as not to leave
passports with Jordanian clerk and not to accept mail or
packages.

<HEADLINE> President: Islamic Revolution Has Support of Most Moslems (by Chen Ming) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran is not shamed to
acknowledge its exportation of Islamic Revolution as it enjoys the
support from a majority of Moslems in the world, President Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The Islamic Revolution has the support of most Moslems around
the world," said Rafsanjani while addressing tens of thousands of
Iranian people in Tehran's Azadi Square, marking the 17th
anniversary of the revolution.
</P>
<P>
The president declared that the Islamic Revolution has become
stronger and Iran is at threshold the 18th year of the
revolution.
</P>
<P>
However, Rafsanjani did not mention any problem such as
economic crisis and hardships which challenge the Islamic regime.
</P>
<P>
In his rarely-seen high-tone anti-U.S. statement, he said: "We
have here representative of over 30 million oppressed people from
 America, the very country which is known for its enmity towards
Islam and allocating covert budget against Iran."
</P>
<P>
The black people have been exploited in America, he said,
adding that they are paying attention to the Islamic Revolution
and they love Iran because Iran is "supporter of Moslems around
the world."
</P>
<P>
"Our enmity is toward the American government, not towards the
American people," he said. "The representative of 30 million
Americans is here and convey their greetings towards our
people."
</P>
<P>
Louis Farrakhan, leader of the Nation of Islam, arrived here
Saturday and made a speech in front of Rafsanjani in the Azadi
Square.
</P>
<P>
He said "I am your Moslem brother from the United States of
America. Me and my delegation are here to pay tribute (to) one of
the most spiritual revolution in the world. We are proud that
Islam is established in Iran."
</P>
<P>
"You must not despair because of the enemies," he told the
Iranians in the square. "You must not become weak in the vanguard
position. You have a lot to be proud of before the revolution."
</P>
<P>
After the speeches of Rafsanjani and Farrakhan, the
participants marched in streets, shouting slogans of their
principled stands and adherence to the objectives of the Islamic
Revolution through a 10-point resolution read out at the end of
the massive march at the square.
</P>
<P>
The first point stressed that Khomeini was the architect of
the grand Islamic revolution in Iran and his guidelines and
revolutionary line will always be followed by the staunch
Iranian nation.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it added, the Iranian people renew their allegiance
to their late leader and are steadfast to it to the last
drop of their blood.
</P>
<P>
The resolution called on the Iranian people to obey Iranian
Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and urged the Islamic government
to act in accordance with the Koran.
</P>
<P>
The resolution called on the executive officials to do
their utmost to further materialize social justice and eradicate
poverty, and firmly deal with corruption which causes widely-spread
social discontent in the country.

<HEADLINE> hke021119--Malaysian Police Continue Hunt For Robbers In Semporna </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian police today
continued their hunt for seven men, believed to be pirates, who
attacked a police station and robbed a goldsmith's shop in
Semporna, Sabah, Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's national news agency Bernama reported that the
search, involving 50 police field force (PFF) and marine police
personnel led by Semporna district police chief Mohamed Yunus
Yassin, is centered on the nearby swamp where the seven fled after
the robbery.
</P>
<P>
Police have yet to determine the direction from which they
came, Bernama said.
</P>
<P>
Saturday, seven men, armed with a pistol and parang, threw a
fish bomb at the police station which houses the PFF and marine
police officers. The police station was seriously damaged but no
one was injured.
</P>
<P>
The seven men then robbed a goldsmith' shop in the town and
made off with 100,000 Malaysian ringgit (about 40,000 US dollars)
worth of jewelry.
</P>
<P>
Semporna, a coastal town in eastern Sabah state, is among the
areas exposed to pirate threats. Malaysia's marine police
statistics show that there were 35 cases of pirate attacks in
Sabah waters between January and September last year, compared
with 34 for the same period in 1994, Bernama said.

<HEADLINE> Manila's Debt Service Ratio Improves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' debt service
ratio as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) is
improving.
</P>
<P>
According to the Department of Finance, the country's debt
service ratio dropped to just 18.2 percent in 1995 compared with a
high of 34.6 percent in 1986.
</P>
<P>
However, in spite of the continued drop in the country's debt
service ratio in recent years, it is still second to the highest
compared with other Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
South Korea had the lowest debt service ratio as of last year
at 4.9 percent and Indonesia had the highest debt service ratio at
32.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, Vietnam, Bangladesh, China and Malaysia have a debt
service ratio of 11.8 percent, 11.7 percent, 13 percent, 10.2
percent and 5 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines' declining debt service ratio was registered
despite the increase in the country's foreign debt stock.
</P>
<P>
The foreign debt level went up to 40 billion US dollars in 1995
from 26.2 billion dollars in 1986.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the country's foreign obligation is expected to
increase further with some 2.6 billion US dollars worth of new
loans.
</P>
<P>
The new loans will bring the country's total foreign debt to
the 42.6 billion dollars mark.

<HEADLINE> Keating Launches New Attack to Turn Around Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister
Paul Keating improved his chance of re-election by announcing
taxation measures to fund election promises made by the Labor
government.
</P>
<P>
The detailed funding plan predicts a total extra revenue of
over 7 billion Australian dollars (5.25 billion US dollars) in the
next four years, more than offsetting the 3.5 billion Australian
dollars (2.6 billion US dollars) additional spending promised by
the Labor government during the period.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the funding plan improved the Labor Party's
credibility in its campaign for the federal election due on March
2.
</P>
<P>
Keating promised Friday that he would reveal today how his
administration would pay for the one billion Australia dollars
(750 million US dollar) a year extra spending on Medicare, roads,
housing and airport noise abatement.
</P>
<P>
"The measures will cover, more than cover, any commitments we
make in the course of this election," he said.
</P>
<P>
Among the funding measures he announced today, a crack down on
tax cheats by wealthy Australians will increase the government's
revenue by 800 million Australian dollars (600 million US dollars)
a year.
</P>
<P>
Phasing off of import tariff concessions and other revenue and
outlays savings measures will also add 4.6 billion Australian
dollars (3.15 billion US dollars) to the government's purse in the
next four years.
</P>
<P>
Keating has gained a positive position by putting the ball in
the Opposition's court.
</P>
<P>
The Opposition coalition of the Liberal and National parties
has promised to spend an extra 700 million Australian dollars (525
million US dollars) a year to counter the Labor government's
election carrots.
</P>
<P>
But Australian voters doubted that the promises of either side
would materialize, because economists estimated that a slowing
economy might turn the target budget surplus for the year of
1996-97 into a deficit.
</P>
<P>
A budget deficit means no matter who wins the election, it will
be impossible for the next government to keep its election
promises unless it increases taxes.
</P>
<P>
Keating's funding plan zigzagged around the touchy question of
a possible budget deficit, because he has refused to let the
Federal Treasury to release the present budget condition as
Opposition leader John Howard demanded.
</P>
<P>
But his funding plan still seems workable. Even Howard could
not find fault with the plan.
</P>
<P>
"As a principle, any measure that the government proposes to
stamp out artificial tax avoidance I will support," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he called for Keating to release the full detail of the
crackdown on tax avoidance. He said that the Labor government was
inefficient because it failed to curb such a large scale of tax
avoidance in its 13 years of office.
</P>
<P>
"The Prime Minister for 13 years has said he has stamped it
out, ...then suddenly on the eve of an election, when he needs
some dough, he suddenly discover it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Keating has challenged Howard by asking him to reveal the
Opposition's funding plan for its election commitments today. But
Howard dodged the challenge by saying that he would choose his own
time to release the costing details.
</P>
<P>
Though the Keating government is still trailing Howard's
Opposition in public opinion polls, he began to take the rein of
the election campaign by playing the credibility card. The
funding plan showed that the Labor party is trustworthy in keeping
its promises and left a question mark on the Opposition's ability
to honor its commitments.
</P>
<P>
The funding plan is the first major stroke that Keating
delivered to his rival. It will give him a handy weapon in
tonight's television debate with Howard, the first and maybe the
only face-to-face battle between the two leaders in the election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Party is gathering steam to catch up with the
Opposition coalition. But it is still to be see whether Keating
will win the crucial battle tonight and lead the Labor Party to a
record consecutive office term.

<HEADLINE> Environment not Affected by Nuclear Power Plant: Scientists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 11 (Xinhua) -- A group of Chinese scientists
said that the two-year operation of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power
Plant has not resulted in "detectable" changes of radioactive
elements in the environment.
</P>
<P>
Headed by Xie Zhenhua, director of State Bureau of
Environmental Protection, the expert group made this conclusion on
the basis of an one-week inspection and investigation tour of the
nuclear power station site located in south China's Guangdong
province.
</P>
<P>
The two generating units, which were put into use in February
and May of 1994 respectively, have been monitored round the clock
by the local government and the power station itself.
</P>
<P>
The monitor networks for the environment around the Daya Bay
Nuclear Power Station conduct tests on the level of radioactive
materials in water, air, soil and animal bodies.
</P>
<P>
Xie and other scientists reviewed all the monitor records,
looked into the nuclear waste disposal work, and conducted a
series of tests on their own.
</P>
<P>
Its gas waste and liquid waste discharged in 1995 were 4.3
percent and 8.3 percent of what were reported in advance. And the
solid waste discharged by the power station has been two times
less than the designed level, and less than the average level in
France, Xie said.
</P>
<P>
The monitor results also show that no radioactive elements and
iodine have been discovered relating to the waste discharges, and
"no detectable change of radioactive materials in the
environmental media has been found," according to Xie.
</P>
<P>
The State Bureau of Oceanography found man-made nuclear
material in some marine lives near the power plant, but its
content is very low and will not cause visible effects to the
ocean environment, he also said.
</P>
<P>
The top anti-pollution official said that the operation of the
Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station proved that nuclear could provide
clean electricity. He reiterated China's position of support to
and tight control over the nuclear energy.
</P>
<P>
He said China is still seeking for new technologies and ways of
management for nuclear power stations.
</P>
<P>
Since it was put into operation, the power plant generated a
combined output value of over 700 million US dollars. the
construction of the plant cost four billion US dollars. It was
China's first nuclear power plant built with foreign investments.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Swallows Glass, Eats Hot Coal: Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 11 (Xinhua) -- A 23-year-old Egyptian
never balks at the thought of chewing a metallic coin, swallowing
glass or eating red hot coal, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Arab Times, a local English-language newspaper disclosed the
special ability of Hisham Thabet Mamlouk.
</P>
<P>
"Fire may burn my fingers if I were to touch it, but eating it
is not a problem," the young man said.
</P>
<P>
He also said the materials he swallows do not digest in his
stomach, and if needed Hisham vomits whatever he ingests.
</P>
<P>
Mamlouk, also known to leap from great heights, told the
interviewer of an Arabic newspaper that his abilities were
"godsend." The paper did not say where the interview was
conducted, however.
</P>
<P>
Recalling his childhood, Mamlouk said nothing extraordinary
happened during that time. "And I only began discovering my talent
in 1991 when I managed lifting heavy weights with ease," he said.
</P>
<P>
Having discovered his ability, he contacted an Egyptian
research institute to discuss his problem.
</P>
<P>
"Scientific tests conducted on my body revealed that my
stomach is capable of retaining several materials like glass,
fiber glass, wood and burning coal," he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Also known as Hisham Pharaoh, the young man said with his
special talent he gave different shows around Egypt and signed
contracts with hotel owners and entertainment organizers.
</P>
<P>
The young man said there are seven other people in Egypt who
have the same abilities. They are Emad Pharaoh, Mohammed Pharaoh,
Awni Pharoah, Aiman Pharaoh, Sayed Shuaib Pharaoh and Hisham
Pharaoh.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question, Hisham said he was not addicted to
eating glass or ingesting red hot coal. "I do this to amuse
people only, other than bettering my talent."
</P>
<P>
With the special ability, he has been able to solve his
unemployment problem and managed to gain fame by conducting shows
at hotels and forging strong contacts with other artists.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Cricket Player Proved "Innocent": HK Professor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Tests with a special
instrument carried out by a Hong Kong professor proved Saturday
that a Sri Lankan cricket player's controversial technique was
nothing wrong, according to a local newspaper report today.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion would give a timely moral boost to Sri Lanka's
preparations for the coming World Cup meet, the English-language
newspaper Hong Kong Standard reported.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan, 23, has been
widely criticized for his unorthodox bowing style, which led to a
late last year decision by the International Cricket Council (ICC)
to support an umpire's no-ball ruling on him, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The finger spinner, a member of the country's World Cup team,
underwent three and a half days' tests carried out by assistant
profession Ravindra Goonetilleke at Hong Kong's University of
Science and Technology this week, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
"The tests prove Muralitharan's off-spin, which was the more
suspect, is not a throw and the leg-spin, which wasn't really
questioned, is also not a throw," the professor was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Goonetilleke said he had forwarded the interim results to Sri
Lanka cricket officials, who are gathering evidence to present to
the ICC, the sport's world governing body.
</P>
<P>
The tests, which saw Muralitharan bowl for four to five hours a
day, proved beyond doubt the chucking allegation was only an
illusion due to his bent arm, the professor said.
</P>
<P>
By using an instrument measuring posture which identifies
repetitive strain injuries, the spinner bowled between 30-50 overs
with electronic wiring strapped to his elbow, fingers and around
his waist.
</P>
<P>
"The device recorded 500 angles and 500 force values per second
from the finger and elbow," Goonelilleke said.
</P>
<P>
"The information was downloaded into a computer and it shows,
according to the game's regulations, he is not throwing," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Final Results of Palestinian Elections Made Public (by huai chengbo) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The list of the 88 members
elected to the Palestinian Council was finalized by the
Palestinian Central Election Commission (CEC) in Gaza Friday night
after three weeks revotes in a couple of polling stations and
recounting of votes in a number of places.
</P>
<P>
According to the CEC, the final official figure of votes for
PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat is 87.1 percent, about one percent
less than the previously-announced official result.
</P>
<P>
The voting turnouts are over 86 percent in the Gaza Strip and
more than 73 percent in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Palestine Liberation Movement (Fatah) led by Arafat
gained 50 of the 88 seats. But the final vote tallies for
all candidates will be published after a meeting today of the
CEC in Ramallah, the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
CEC chairman Mahmoud Abbas said that losing candidates who
still wished to appeal could petition the four-judge Election
Appeals Court for two more days.
</P>
<P>
According to an announcement in Gaza, Arafat will assume the
post of the President of the Palestinian National Authority
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
But, no decision has yet been reached on when the 88-strong
council will convene. Arafat is expected to convene the council
shortly after the holy month of Ramadan ends on February 20.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Criticizes Water Officials For Demanding Exorbitant charges From Consumers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARAREh, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe yesterday criticized water officials for demanding
exorbitant payments from water consumers.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said that water officials from many councils did not
read meters when they charged for the use of water and demanded
exorbitant payments from consumers.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a rally in eatern Zimbabwe on Saturday, the
president said that he had a property that was not being used but
was asked at the end of the month to pay 3,000 Zimbabwe Dollars
(330 U.S. Dollars) in water charges.
</P>
<P>
''I refused to pay because there is no one using water at this
property. Where did this 3,000 Zimbabwe Dollars bill come from?
Many of these water officials were not reading meters but doing
guesswork,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> China Upstages Japan, Kazakhstan Makes a Splash (Asiad)  By Sportswriters Cao Jianjie and Liang Xiyi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, China, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Few had expected China
to top two-time champion Japan, and Kazakhstan to go as far as a
runner-up overall. But they did it at last, and did it in style.
</P>
<P>
The week-long Asian Winter Games, which drew a record 17
country and regions, rang down its curtain on Sunday with China
atop at the medal tally with 15 golds.
</P>
<P>
China, second overall in the previous two games, both held in
Sapporo of Japan, showed Asia that it remained a power in the
short-track speedskating and figure skating. Moreover, it has
become a force on snow after lifting four golds in Yabuli, a ski
resort some 200 kilometers from Harbin.
</P>
<P>
China bagged 11 golds on ice, where its quartet created a new
world record at the women's short-track 3,000 meters relay, the
only world mark set in the games.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese athletes did a brilliant job," Zhu Chengyi, deputy
chief of the Chinese delegation, said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"China's rapid improvement in the winter sports and the
athletes' fighting spirit helped the country become number one in
Asia," said Zhu, who had told a pre-game press conference that
China would be happy with a second-place finish with 10 golds.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan, a debutant to the games, underlined their skiing
prowess with 10 golds out of their total 14.
</P>
<P>
The winter sports giant from central Asia landed four golds on
ice, including the one from its men's ice hockey squad, which
handed a 20-0 whitewash to defending champion China en route to
the title.
</P>
<P>
"We had aimed for a third place before the games," said Anatoli
Koulnazarov, delegation chief of Kazakhstan. "We were a bit
surprised as we finished second overall and so close to the
leading country."
</P>
<P>
Japan tumbled to a third spot at the medal table with eight
golds and South Korea, which had eight golds but less silvers,
came fourth.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese delegation head Yoshiya Yamazaki was so upset
about Japan's humiliating defeat that he called an emergency
meeting on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He told the meeting that Japan should reshuffle its winter
sports system if it wanted to regain the status as Asia's number
one in the 1998 Winter Olympics to be held in Nagano, Japan.
</P>
<P>
The games concluded with a harvest of new Asian records. All
nine Asian marks at the speedskating were shattered and three
other new records came from the short-track rink.
</P>
<P>
The Asian winter sports has come into a new era and there won't
be any run-away leader, said Yamazaki.
</P>
<P>
"With China coming up so fast and Kazakhstan joining Asia, no
country can say for sure it will top the next games," he added.
</P>
<P>
Despite a record 17 entries to the games, Asian winter sports
remained a domain for a few delegations.
</P>
<P>
Only five countries have sealed their names on the medal tally
with Uzbekistan last with one silver and one bronze.
</P>
<P>
In the first games, only four countries had won medals and in
the second, five had reached the medal standings.
</P>
<P>
With two years to go before the Nagano Olympics, a few Asian
countries are considering a shot at Olympic honors.
</P>
<P>
China plans a head-on clash with South Korea in the four-gold
short-track competition in Nagano while Japan hopes to cash in on
its home-turf advantage to improve on its one ski gold from the
1994 Lillehammer Games.
</P>
<P>
Pundits say Asia's hopes for winter Olympic medals are riding
on ice, especially in the short-track and speedskating events, as
the continent still lags behind Europe and North America on snow.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan had swept a lion's share of the ski events, laying
bare the defects of the rest of Asia on snow, but it isn't strong
enough to strike gold in Nagano, said its delegation chief
Koulnazarov.
</P>
<P>
"Kazakhstan will be settled for silver or bronze medals in the
1998 Olympics," he said.

<P>
ABU DHABI, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Qatar will attend the next
meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), ending a crisis
between Qatar and other GCC members.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers today quoted a source close to the Qatari
government as saying that Qatar will take part in the next GCC
foreign minister meeting in Riyadh in March.
</P>
<P>
Qatar threatened to boycott all future meetings after a dispute
which arose at the last GCC summit meeting in Muscat in December
when Qatar opposed to the election of Jamil al Hujeilan, a Saudi,
as general secretary of the organization.
</P>
<P>
The reconciliation came after the mediation of Oman, which
enjoys good relations with Qatar, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Oman's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Yussef Ben Alawi
visited Qatar on Friday, during which he met with the Emir of
Qatar Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani.
</P>
<P>
"There is not longer a problem over the choice of
Mr. Hujeilan," the source said, stressing that Qatar had objected
to the manner in which he was appointed and not him as an
individual.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Medical Aid Society In Serious Cash Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The public services medical
aid society of Zimbabwe is in financial dire straits after the
government failed to pay 3.6 million U.S. Dollars worth of
contributions for its employees.
</P>
<P>
A source of the society told local newspaper yesterday that
the financial problems at the society, which facilitates for
medical services to more than 300,000 members from the public and
parastatal sectors, were said to be so bad that payments to
doctors and other providers of medical service were being done
from overdrafts.
</P>
<P>
The society's dependence on overdrafts had allegedly made the
situation even worse since the society's financial burden kept
growing bigger because of the resultant high interest rate.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Ministry of Public Service, Labour and
Social Welfare confirmed the situation and said that the problem
was mainly caused by the payment system introduced by the
government recently to curb over-expenditure.

<HEADLINE> Japan Postpones Mission to Seoul Over Isles Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 11 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Japanese
delegation has postponed a visit to Seoul after South Korean
President Kim Young-sam canceled a planned meeting with it as an
expression of displeasure over Japan's territorial claim.
</P>
<P>
The decision to postpone the visit was made late Saturday
night, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
In Seoul, a presidential spokesman said in a statement Saturday
that Japan's "absurd remarks" claiming sovereignty to the Tokto
isles could not be tolerated and South Korea would deal with the
matter in a resolute manner.
</P>
<P>
"Japan has again caused an uproar in South Korea and widespread
anger among South Korean people by making a preposterous claim
over the Tokto islet, which is clearly an integral part of South
Korea's territory," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Tokto islet in the Sea of Japan is called the Takeshima
islands in Japan.
</P>
<P>
A meeting between the Japanese delegation from the ruling
coalition parties, led by Taku Yamashita, head of the Liberal
Democratic Party's Policy Research Council, and President Kim had
been scheduled for Monday to discuss Japan's plans to resume
normalization talks with the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese mission was reportedly to carry a letter from
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto to Kim calling for
improved bilateral relations, even as ties are strained over
conflicting claims to the rocky islands.
</P>
<P>
In South Korea, a senior official was quoted as saying that a
summit meeting between Kim and Hashimoto in March would be
jeopardized if the diplomatic row over the islands escalates.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders are scheduled to have summit talks in Bangkok
when they attend the Asia-Europe Meeting on March 1-2 for the
first time since Hashimoto took office one month ago.
</P>
<P>
The territorial dispute erupted following Japan's recent
decision to adopt a 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone
through ratification of the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea.
</P>
<P>
Japan on Friday officially protested South Korea's plan to
build marine facilities on the isles, which it insisted are an
integral part of Japanese territory.

<HEADLINE> China Takes Women's Ice Hockey Crown at Winter Asiad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BARBIN, China, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese women's ice
hockey team edged the Japanese 9-3 on Sunday to win the last gold
medal of the week-long Third Asian Winter Games here.
</P>
<P>
China built a 3-1 lead in the first period, but Japan scored
twice against China's three in the second period.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese sixth added three goals in the unanswered third
period to seal the gold meal, which was the 15th for the host
delegation in the week-long winter games.
</P>
<P>
China had beaten Kazakhstan 13-0 before winning all the two
round-robin three teams tournament, which made a debut to the
games.
</P>
<P>
Japan, nipping Kazakhstan 6-2 in the opener on Friday, took the
silver with a 1-1 win-loss record, while Kazakhstan was third
without a win.
</P>
<P>
"We are happy to win the first women's ice hockey title in the
history of the Asain winter Games," said Zhang Zhinan, coach of
the Chinese team. "But we are aiming at the Winter Olympic Games
in Nagano in 1998."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team is taking part in the 1997 world championship,
where the first five teams will qualify for the Nagano Winter
Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Reform Gives More People Chances to Study Abroad (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Chinese government spends about 10,000 U.S. dollars on each
person studying abroad a year. The amount of money can help at
least 400 children receive six-year elementary education.
</P>
<P>
Sending more people abroad for further training was adopted as
an important part of China's reform and opening up policy in
1978. The number of people sent abroad at the state expense has
jumped to 2,000-3,000 from 200-300 a year in less than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
However, the ways of selecting and sending people abroad for
further training were developed on the basis of that adopted in
1950s when China sent students to former Soviet Union and east
Europe. According to the old ways, the quota was assigned by
higher authorities. Most often, someone's superior, who decided
whether he or she should be given the chance, had to accept the
quota no matter whether the international study met the demand or
not.
</P>
<P>
The reform pays more attention to demands of the national
economic construction and social development. Once there is need,
there is chance. As the reform made the criteria for
state-scholarship winners public, people hoping to get the chance
are expected to take part in a fair play and an intensive
competition.
</P>
<P>
Li Youyi, a section chief in charge of the Teachers' Affairs in
Nanjing University located in Jiangsu, said that the reform would
not have much impact on universities, because many famous Chinese
universities and colleges have very good contacts with their
counterparts in foreign countries. Taking Nanjing University for
example, about two-thirds of all staff members who have been sent
abroad for research or study were on university-to-university
exchange and cooperation programs. Only eight people from the
university would go abroad for study at the state expense this
year.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Minister Wei Yu noted that the reform in selecting and
sending people out on international studies has nothing to do with
the individual-paid international studies. The government will
continue to support people going abroad for study and encourage
them to return home after finishing their studies. "They are still
free to come and go," Wei stressed.

BEIJING, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Zhou Yuan, 40, is a vice-mayor
of Xinghua city, located in central part of east China's Jiangsu
Province. He will soon go to Britain to study administrative
management on prefectures and districts for a year at the state
expense.
</P>
<P>
"He wouldn't have had the opportunity if the government did not
reform ways of selecting and sending people abroad for further
study," said Wei Yu, vice-minister in charge of the State
Education Commission (SEC), in a recent interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Yuan became one of the first group of administrative
officials in China who are sent abroad to study at the state
expense, when he received the credential from Vice-Minister Wei Yu
in Nanjing, capital city of Jiangsu Province, at the end of last
year.
</P>
<P>
China decided to reform its old system of selecting and sending
people abroad for state-sponsored studies a couple of years
ago. Jiangsu Province and northeast China's Jilin Province were
chosen for trial implementation of the new ways last April.
</P>
<P>
The trial reform enabled people in the two provinces to hand in
individual applications. Experts who were from across the country
and majored in various academic fields decided whether the
application was acceptable. An applicant must get approval from at
least five experts.
</P>
<P>
At a national working meeting on international studies held at
the end of last month, the SEC announced that the new ways of
sending people abroad for study will be taken across the country,
as the experiments in Jiangsu and Jilin were successful.
</P>
<P>
During the following days, letters and phone calls from farmers
and urban residents poured in, asking about the reform.
</P>
<P>
"The new methods bring about more chances for people employed
in various trades," Wei Yu said.
</P>
<P>
The reform turns state-sponsored overseas study into a
subsidiary-funded one. Those with their applications approved
would sign a contract with the newly founded China's National
Scholarship Council for International Studies (NSCIS), which will
deal with matters related to the international studies on behalf
of the SEC. The NSCIS will provide them scholarship covering
mainly international travel tickets, living stipend and necessary
subsidiary payments.
</P>
<P>
According to the contract, each who enjoys the scholarship has
to pay a deposit of no more than 50,000 yuan (over 6,000
U.S. dollars). The money along with interests will be refunded to
the person if he or she returns within a contracted time period to
serve the country. Otherwise, he or she must pay the NSCIS for the
studies and be fined for breaking the contract.

<HEADLINE> Unsigned HKFA Statement Sparks Fury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 11 (Xinhua) -- An unsigned statement issued
Saturday by the Hong Kong Football Association (HKFA) has sparked
fierce reaction even from officials of the Association itself.
</P>
<P>
The two-page statement, faxed to the media late Saturday night
with the HKFA letter-head and company chop, explained the
Association's stance in the on-going problems between the HKFA and
 a rebel group consisting of all the 10 First Division clubs.
</P>
<P>
It was in fact a peace proposal from the HKFA for a settlement
of the disputes with the breakaway group, called the Association
of Hong Kong Professional Football Clubs (AHKPFC).
</P>
<P>
HKFA Vice-President Albert Hung cho-hou, who is also Supremo of
the first division club of South China, labeled the letter as
"improper".
</P>
<P>
"Whoever sent it, it was not from the FA," Hung said during
last night's charity matches in the Mong Kok Stadium for raising
funds for the recent Yunnan province earthquake victims.
</P>
<P>
"The statement only represents an individual and does not mean
that the HKFA has anything to do with it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Statements released to the press and the public could only be
done with the consent of the HKFA Council.
</P>
<P>
"Whoever wrote the statement has no right to do so," he added.
</P>
<P>
Veronica Chan, another HKFA Vice-President, said she had also
not been informed of the letter before. She described it was
"irresponsible" for such a letter to be released.
</P>
<P>
A HKFA official later confirmed that the letter was sent from
the HKFA headquarters under the instruction of its president
Stewart Lee Leung-nag.
</P>
<P>
Experts here think the unapproved statement may do more harm
than good as the HKFA had already set Wednesday as the day they
meet with the AHKPFC representatives to discuss its status in the
HKFA and things concerning the coming Carlsberg Cup Lunar New Year
tournament.

BUENOS AIRES, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Argentina is calling for

The government has taken preventive measures, including
intensified information collection, as 10 victims of cholera have
been found in the capital.

<P>
TOKYO, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Rescue wokers are trying hard
this morning to reach about 20 people trapped in a highway tunnel
but barely made any progress owing to continuing mountain slides,
the Jiji news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
A bus was trapped in a tunnel Saturday after a rock of about
50,000 tons fell off a mountainside and crushed the tunnel on
Hokkaido Island, north Japan.
</P>
<P>
The rescuers were only able to reach the roof of the bus by
squeezing through cracks in the rock and mud blocking the tunnel,
but they failed to get the passengers out, Jiji said.
</P>
<P>
Nineteen people were believed to be aboard the bus and another
car carrying a 20-year-old worker was also buried in the
1,086-meter tunnel on a seaside highway in Yoichi outside the port
city of Otaru.
</P>
<P>
Police are trying to remove mud and rocks with construction
machinery, but work is being delayed by continuing slides, the

<HEADLINE> Guarantor Military Chiefs to Monitor Peru, Ecuador Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Military chiefs of the four
guarantor countries of the Rio de Janeiro Protocol arrived here
today to monitor a military meeting between Peru and Ecuador in
their efforts to end a territorial dispute peacefully.
</P>
<P>
The high-ranking military officials from Argentina, Brazil,
Chile and the United States will witness on Sunday a key meeting
of military commanders of the two countries, Jorge Ortega of
Ecuador and Nicolas Hermoza of Peru.
</P>
<P>
They are also expected to visit border posts of Patuca in
Ecuador and Cahuide in Peru to inspect part of the demilitarized
zone.
</P>
<P>
The visit of the top brass and the Ecuadoran-Peruvian talks are
considered a positive step toward boosting mutual confidence after
the signing of the Itamaraty peace treaty in Brazil on February
17, 1995.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed in the treaty to withdraw their troops
from the conflict area and to establish non-military zones there.
</P>
<P>
Territorial disputes between Peru and Ecuador could be traced
back to the 1940s. They signed the Rio de Janeiro Protocol on
January 29, 1942 to stipulate the sovereignty of the disputed
200,000-square-kilometer area.
</P>
<P>
A new round of military conflicts broke out in January 1995 and
the two sides are now negotiating on border demarcation in a strip
of the disputed region.

<HEADLINE> Tin Output Down in Thailand's Top Producing Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Tin output in Thailand's top
tin producing province, Phang Nga, south Thailand, has plummeted
considerably, according to the governor of the province.
</P>
<P>
Phang Nga, also the country's largest tin ore exporting
province, earned just 6.41 million baht (256,400 US dollars) from
tin ore sales last month, a dramatic drop from the 100 million
baht (4 million dollars) a month it earned in years past.
</P>
<P>
The province is promoting agriculture and tourism in an attempt
to diversify its economy amid a continuing slump in tin prices,
the Bangkok Post quoted Governor Precha Rakkid as saying.
</P>
<P>
For years, tin had been the country's top money maker among
Thai minerals. In 1982, Thailand ranked third among the world's
biggest tin producers, next only to Indonesia and Malaysia, with
35,644 tons, at a value of 8 billion baht (320 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Ten years later, in 1992, tin production dropped to fifth place
of the country's mineral industry, with only 11,484 tons, worth
1.24 billion baht (49 million dollars), averaging 957 tons per
month.

<P>
COLOMBO, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The security of Colombo will
be taken over by the Sri Lankan Army shortly, according to a local
press report today.
</P>
<P>
Army Major General Jaliya Nammuni has been asked to take charge
of security in Colombo once the Army's takeover becomes effective,
Military sources were quoted by the report as saying .
</P>
<P>
The move follows a revamping of security measures islandwide
after the Central Bank bombing which is considered the most
devastating urban guerrilla strike by the rebel Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
A bomb blast by the LTTE in the capital which killed 80 people
and injured more than 1,200 on January 31.
</P>
<P>
The Army was given the task of maintaining security in Colombo
several years ago, but the military was later withdrawn and the
Police resumed control. The police are at present responsible for
security in the city and its suburbs.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Immigration Act to Be Amended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian government
will amend the immigration act to increase five-fold to 50,000
Malaysian Ringgit (about 20,000 US dollars) the maximum fine for
harboring illegal immigrants in the country, Malaysia's national
news agency Bernama reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted Malaysia's Deputy Home Affairs Minister Megat
Junid Megat Ayob as saying that the act would also be amended to
provide for a jail penalty up to five years, or jail and fine, for
such offense.
</P>
<P>
He said the amendment was being made because the current
maximum fine of 10,000 Ringgit (about 4,000 dollars) had not
deterred the locals from harboring or abetting the illegal
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Megat Junid explained that the 50,000 Ringgit fine was for
harboring one illegal immigrant and the amount might be increased
if two or more illegal immigrants were involved, adding the fine
applied to both individual and syndicates.
</P>
<P>
He also said the illegal immigrant settlements in the Klang
Valley, the government temporary reserve land, were some 72, and
asked the local authorities to deal with the matter seriously.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, more than 400 people were
arrested in 1995 for harboring illegal immigrants, and it is also
reported that about one million illegal immigrants, mainly from
Bangladesh, Indonesia, the Philippines, were working in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Megat Junid said if the phenomenon of illegal immigrants were
not stopped, it would cause various problems for the people and
government.

<P>
BEIJING, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Schindler Group of
Switzerland has decided to invest another 620 million yuan (75
million US dollars) in the China Schindler Elevator Co. Ltd.(CSE)

total investment of 16 million yuan in two plants, in Beijing and
Shanghai, making elevators and escalators.
</P>
<P>
CSE generated a sales volume of 1.52 billion yuan (183 million
US dollars) last year, 42 times that of 1981, and the CSE official

<HEADLINE> Dominican President Asks to Continue Rescue Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Dominican President
Joaquin Balaguer has ordered to continue the search for victims'
bodies in the worst air accident off the country's northern coast,
according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The search will continue until Monday, though local authorities
had announced Saturday that they would end the search of human
remains.
</P>
<P>
German Ambassador in Santo Domingo, Edmund Duckwitz, expressed
gratitude for the president's order.
</P>
<P>
Not all the bodies of the passengers, mostly Germans, and crew
members have been recovered since the plane Wednesday crashed into
waters off the northern coast of the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
Local and German experts are working at the Forensic Anatomic
Institute in Santo Domingo to identify the bodies, most of which
were mutilated by sharks, with the assistance of relatives of the
victims.
</P>
<P>
So many bodies were torn apart in the wake of the air crash
that officials Thursday revised the number of corpses recovered
from 126 to about 80, and then 72 closer study Friday, said the
reports.
</P>
<P>
Experts from Dominica, the United States and Germany are
continuing their hunt for the airliner's black box, which can
offer clues to the cause of the accident.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has demanded a full investigation
into the accident.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers gave up at dusk Thursday after searching a sea
of debris for two days, though it soon was clear that no one could
have lived through the impact when Flight 301 apparently nose-dived
from 2,100 meters into the sea 25 kilometers from Puerto Plata,
the north coast resort in the Dominican Republic.

</P>

running television ads about each other -- and me," wire services
quoted the president as saying.

LONDON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Maria Mutola of
Muzambique today broke one of the longest-standing indoor
track records as she swept to victory in the women's 1,000
meter at the international indoor tour in Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
At the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham, Mutola clocked
2 minutes 32.08 seconds to smash the previous record of 2
minutes 34.80 seconds set by Brigitte Kraus of East Germany
in Dortmund in 1978.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the race, she said: "I think
I can break it again if we reach 800 meters in 1:56 or 1:57,
but this was beautiful."
</P>
<P>
The young African athlete also promised to make greater
efforts in a bid to win a 800 and 1,500 double at the
Olympics in Atlanta later this year.
</P>
<P>
Tony Jarrett of Britain claimed an impressive victory,
beating world indoor and outdoor hurdles champion Allen
Johnson of the United States over the 60 meter hurdles.
</P>
<P>
In the 200-meter race, John Regis of Britain was outpaced
by Norwegian Geir Moen while, the British rising star Jason
Gardener won the third place.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Olympic champion Sally Gunnell and her arch-rival
Sandra Farmer-Patrick of the United States both were
disqualified in the 400-meter hurdles for running out of
their lanes before the "breaking point".
</P>
<P>
Gunnell, who is making a dramatic comeback after a heel
injury, accepted the decision and she also expressed
satisfaction over her state by saying "it was good to be
leading into the final bend".
</P>
<P>
While the American is quoted as complaining: "It was
their mistake for not telling us where the break was."

<HEADLINE> China's Technology Imports Soar in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 11 (Xinhua) -- China place 3,629 orders for
equipment and technology imports worth 13.03 billion US dollars
last year, tripling its contractual spending from the previous
year, the "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
"Equipment and technology imports accounted for 10 percent of
China's total imports last year, up from 3.5 percent in 1994," Hu
Zhaoqing of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation
(Moftec) was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Heavier funding from the State treasury and other channels
propelled the technology import growth, he explained, noting that
registered state funding totalled 14.3 billion US dollars, up 48
percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Another Moftec official said that "technology imports last year
had likely cost China 16 to 17 billion US dollars in foreign
exchange."
</P>
<P>
The difference is believed to be covered by enterprises' own
fund-raising and an increasing amount of foreign lending to State
appointed major construction projects, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He said that technology imports climaxed last year because
during the period China put more projects under construction,
namely nuclear and thermal power stations, subways and steel
plants, all with hefty contractual spending on technology imports.
</P>
<P>
The official predicted China's technology imports in the years
to come will be more closely connected with overseas fund raising,
while Europe and North America will will remain China's major
technology suppliers.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan Reaffirms One China Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Kazakh Foreign Minister
Kasymzhomart Tokayev has reiterated his country's one China policy
and promised to continue to ban any separatist activities against
China in Kazakh territories.
</P>
<P>
Tokayev told Xinhua in an interview on Friday that his country
recognizes that the government of the People's Republic of China
is the sole legitimate government of China and Taiwan is an
inseparable part of China.
</P>
<P>
On Sino-Kazakh relations, he said they are characterized by
solid legal base, more high-level political dialogs and closer
economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of visits by Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev
and Chinese Premier Li Peng in recent years showed that the two
countries are maintaining long-term neighborly and mutually
beneficial relations, Tokayev said.
</P>
<P>
The good relations between the two sides are in the interests
of the two peoples and conducive to stability in Asia as well, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The minister also expressed gratitude to China for its support
for a conference on confidence-building in Asian nations proposed
by Nazarbayev.
</P>
<P>
He said China's permission for Kazakhstan to use Lianyungang, a
port city in east China's Jiangsu province, as a transit point for
its export cargoes has helped the country to open a new outlet to
the Pacific and offered good trade opportunities between
Kazakhstan and countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
The minister also talked about his country's relations with
Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
On the European security, he said an eastward expansion of NATO
seems unavoidable. However, he held that NATO has to take into
account Russia's concern in this respect as well as the interests
of all other parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister is scheduled to visit China on Monday.

HELSINKI, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Finnish President Martti
Ahtisaari today met with the visiting Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov on the situation in Bosnia, European security and
regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Primakov, who was appointed foreign minister on January 9, said
the bilateral relations are well-grounded. He thanked Finland
for its support for Russia to join the European Council.
</P>
<P>
Referring to NATO's eastward enlargement, he said that it will
certainly not contribute to the European security.
</P>
<P>
Primakov, who arrived here Friday, held his first meeting
Friday with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who is
scheduled to meet his Russian counterpart in March in preparation
for a visit to Moscow by U.S. President Bill Clinton in April.
</P>
<P>
The two sides discussed a wide range of issues, including
NATO's eastward expansion, the Bosnian situation, the Middle East
peace process, arms control and the U.S.-Russian ties in
particular.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the meeting, the two foreign ministers told
reporters that they had made a "good start" despite some existing
differences.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Government Releases Four Serb Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, February 10 (Xinhua) - The Bosnian government today
released four of the Serb soldiers who were detained on suspicion
of committing war crimes, but two senior officers were apparently
not among them.
</P>
<P>
The four Serb soldiers were identified by Bosnian government
liaison officers as Zoran Spasojevic, Branislav Lolic, Milan
Bogunvic and Mico Dosenovic.
</P>
<P>
They were driven to the Bridge of Brotherhood and Unity in the
Bosnian capital of Sarajevo at about 07:15 p.m. (1815 GMT), said
reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
A government statement said there has been no evidence
indicating the four had committed war crimes.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian authorities held at least eight Serbs, including a
general and a colonel, citing their alleged involvement in war
crimes as the reason.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers were arrested when they were driving through the
government-controlled territory. The Serbs reacted to the arrests
with suspension of all their contacts with NATO forces.

<HEADLINE> Mostar Test For Bosnian Federation, Sacirbey Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Whether European Union (EU)
administrator's plan for Mostar can be implemented is a test for
the survival of the Muslim-Croat Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina,
former Bosnian foreign minister Muhamed Sacirbey said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference that "there can be no federation
without Mostar, and without the Federation there can be neither
Dayton (a U.S. city where a peace accord was initialed) nor peace."
</P>
<P>
The way to solve the crisis in Mostar, for the Muslims as well
as for the Croats, was to accept the arbitration by Hans Koschnik,
the EU administrator, said Sacirbey, who will become the Bosnian
ambassador to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"If we really believe in the future of relations between Croatia
and Bosnia-Herzegovina and in the future of the Federation in Mostar
then this is the last chance," Sacirbey said.
</P>
<P>
Koschnik announced on Wednesday his arbitration on Mostar which
would include three Croat districts, three Muslim districts and
one central mixed district. The Croats, who feared that the central
district would be dominated by Muslims, rejected the arbitration.
</P>
<P>
Sacirbey said that the refusal to accept Koschnik's plan was
actually the refusal to accept the co-existence of Croats and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
He expressed surprise at the fact that the refusal of Koschnik's
plan by the Mostar Croats had been supported by the Croatian
government.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serbs Continue Cooperation with IFOR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb Prime Minister
Rajko Kasagic said today the Serb state Republika Srpska is
continuing its cooperation with the NATO-led peace Implementation
Force (IFOR).
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA quoted a statement from a
government session that the "kidnaping of Gen. Djorde Djukic and
other Serb officers is an attack on the Dayton accord," but the
incident should not jeopardize cooperation between Republika
Srpska and IFOR.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Serb Army announced on Thursday to suspend its
contacts with IFOR to protest the arrest of eight Serb officers
and soldiers, including Gen. Djukic and Col. Aleksa Krmanovic, by
the Muslim government. The Serb government has also severed all
contacts with the Muslim-Croat federation.
</P>
<P>
The IFOR commander Admiral Leighton Smith on Friday urged the
Serbs to return to the negotiation table, saying Serbs would gain
more by taking part in the peace process than staying out of it.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim government has accused five of the eight detained
Serbs of committing war crimes during the civil war. But the two
officers are not on the list of 52 war criminals indicted by the
Hague-based international war crimes tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Today's statement said the Bosnian Serb government expected the
international community to help release the seized persons and
warned the Muslim-Croat federation to stop violating the Dayton
accord.
</P>
<P>
The Serbs have blamed the IFOR for not protecting the Serb
soldiers and officers in the IFOR-controlled area and have urged
Smith to pressure the release of the detained Serbs.

<HEADLINE> Boeing to Double Orders From Canadian Part Suppliers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 10 (xinhua) -- Boeing Co. will double its
annual orders from Canadian parts suppliers to 1.3 billion
Canadian dollars (about 949 million U.S. dollars) in the next few
years, the Canadian daily Financial Post said today.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted Boeing spokesman Errol Weaver as saying that
the rising purchases for its 127 Canadian suppliers will begin in
late 1996 and continue through the early years of the next decade.
</P>
<P>
Weaver said Canadian aerospace industries, which manufacture
tail, wing and nose components and other parts for the Boeing 737,
747 and 767, could pick up as much as 600 million Canadian dollars
worth of new business a year.
</P>
<P>
Boeing, the world's largest aircraft manufacturer, booked
orders for 346 jets worth 31.23 billion U.S. dollars in 1995,
including 12.7 billion U.S. dollars order from Singapore Airlines.
</P>
<P>
With its 1995 workload, Boeing holds a commanding 70 percent
share of the global market for new passenger jets, the Financial
Post said. In the first three weeks of January, it got order for
another 134 planes.

LUSAKA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Foundation for Democratic
Process of Zambia (FODEP), a leading independent mass
organization, today appealed to all political parties in the
country to desist from political violence.
</P>
<P>
FODEP National Secretary Bishop John Mambo told reporters here
that every party and citizens alike should know that riots would
only bring untold sufferings to the people in the country if not
checked.
</P>
<P>
Youths too, should bear in mind that they should not be
incited to go to streets to fan violence because doing so, could
only scare away investors who were supposed to create jobs for
them, Mambo said.
</P>
<P>
The bishop voiced his support for President Frederick
Chiluba's stand of non-violent political confrontations with
opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to leaders of the opposition parties to emulate
President Chiluba to desist from violence, so that the on-going
economic recovery programs would not be disrupted during this
year of the general elections.
</P>
<P>
President Chiluba yesterday urged the ruling party cadres and
supporters not to disrupt peaceful demonstrations held by
opposition parties in order to respect democracy and the rule of
law.

<HEADLINE> Program to Control River Blindness Set up in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 10 (Xinhua) -- An African program for the
control of onchocerciasis (apoc) or river blindness has been
established in 16 African countries, including Nigeria, the News
Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
The apoc is a world bank-assisted project, which would last at
least 12 years.
</P>
<P>
The zonal program manager of the national onchocerciasis control
program in Nigeria, Dr. Henry Edeghere, was quoted by the news
agency as explaining in Kaduna, northern Nigeria on Friday
that a member country needed to provide 25 percent of the funds
requested from apoc before it could receive any financial
assistance for the control of river blindness in its area.
</P>
<P>
The manager said the national onchocerciasis control
program would soon launch a fund-raising appeal at all levels
to enable it to meet the apoc requirement.
