<HEADLINE> Testing Glitch Fails Minn. Students  </HEADLINE>
By PATRICK HOWE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PAUL (AP) -- As many as 336 high school seniors were not
allowed to graduate because a private scoring company incorrectly
graded the mathematics portion of a state test, officials said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 7,989 students who took the test in February and April
this year were mistakenly told they failed when they actually
passed.
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota Department of Children, Families and Learning
discovered mistakes in the scoring of six questions earlier this
week. The mistakes affected 47,097 tests, all scored by the
National Computer Systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Basic Standards Test measures skills the students should
have learned by eighth grade and are designed to ensure all high
school graduates have a minimum competency. Most students pass the
test on their first try.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am outraged by the errors committed by NCS and the harm they
have caused Minnesota students, families and schools,'' Education
Commissioner Christine Jax said.
</P>
<P>
   She said correct score information and an apology from the
company would be mailed to all students by Aug. 21.
</P>
<P>
   National Computer Systems President David Smith said the errors
resulted when the test was formatted. The order of some questions
was changed, and the answer key to one test version was corrected
to match but not the other, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We make no excuses. This is completely unacceptable to our
company, as it is to everyone in Minnesota,'' Smith said. He said
the company will offer $1,000 in tuition aid to students who failed
to graduate due to the errors.
</P>
<P>
   A public graduation ceremony, paid for by NCS, will be held for
any students who did not graduate because of the errors, Jax said.
</P>
<P>
   The mistake will mean lots of work for schools, said Kate Foate
Trewick, chief academic officer for St. Paul Public Schools, where
at least 25 students were kept from graduating.
</P>
<P>
   School officials are trying to work with colleges to get those
students enrolled, meanwhile, fall high school classes already have
been scheduled based on the faulty scores.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it certainly shakes peoples' confidence in high stakes
testing,'' Trewick said. ''I suppose you could say it has dealt a
blow.''

<HEADLINE> Texas, Oklahoma Sign Boundary Deal  </HEADLINE>
By KELLIE B. GORMLY
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- A border conflict dating back nearly 200 years was
finally settled Friday, pending approval by the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders from Texas and Oklahoma resolved the last part of the
states' boundary dispute along the Red River at an area within Lake
Texoma about 60 miles north of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Although both states had agreed that their border would run
along the river's south bank, the line's whereabouts within the
lake weren't finalized until Friday.
</P>
<P>
   At a ceremony to sign the agreement, Oklahoma state Sen. Jeff
Rabon jokingly called it ''a closure to the final chapter of the
Louisiana Purchase.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents near Lake Texoma say the imaginary line has always
been there, but precise knowledge of the border is important for
property taxes, mineral rights, criminal jurisdictions and licenses
for hunting and fishing.
</P>
<P>
   For example, duck hunters sometimes found that licenses they had
bought were good for one side of the lake but not the other.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's agreement is part of the Red River Boundary Compact,
which the U.S. House has approved and the Senate is expected to
approve soon.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court in 1896 and 1923 defined the boundary
between Oklahoma and Texas as a line identified by wooden stakes on
the river bank.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's agreement draws the border along the south bank's
vegetation line, which supporters of the pact say is easier to
identify. The states can agree to change the boundary if the
vegetation line erodes.

<HEADLINE> Fire Breaks Out at Grand Coulee Dam  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND COULEE, Wash. (AP) -- A fire broke out Friday in one of
Grand Coulee Dam's three powerhouses, disrupting hydropower
production at the dam and injuring a worker, a dam spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the loss of about half of the dam's electricity
production, the Bonneville Power Administration reported no
disruption to its power transmission system, said Ed Mosey, a
Portland, Ore.-based spokesman for the federal power-marketing
agency.
</P>
<P>
   All of the electricity produced at the dam, the largest
hydropower producer in the nation, is routed to the BPA, a federal
power-marketing agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''The system was able to absorb it without any disruptions,''
Mosey said.
</P>
<P>
   The fire started about 2:15 p.m. after one of the dam's circuit
breakers malfunctioned while a dam operator was working on it, said
Craig Sprankle, a spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation,
which operates the dam.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was contained to the underground room where it broke
out, Sprankle said, but thick smoke filled the concrete powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The worker, Bob Hart, 55, suffered burns to his arms and legs
and was airlifted to the burn unit at Harborview Medical Center in
Seattle, Sprankle said. Hart was listed in satisfactory condition
with burns on his arms and neck.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 24 main generators at the dam, 14 went off line
automatically because of the fire. Four others were already off
line for routine maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until we can get the smoke cleared and see what happened, we
won't bring those generators on line again,'' Sprankle said.
</P>
<P>
   The dam is in central Washington on the Columbia River.

   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Two federal appeals judges Friday granted Napster Inc.
a stay allowing the wildly popular music trading service to remain online -- at
least temporarily. The service was facing a midnight PDT deadline for shutting
down after a lower court judge sided with the recording industry, which claimed
Napster allows users to violate copyrights. Friday's ruling means Napster can
remain in operation at least until the lawsuit goes to trial; no trial date has

5 Early Concorde Incidents Cited
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Blown tires on the European-built Concorde supersonic
planes caused five ''potentially catastrophic'' incidents in the first two years
of the luxury airliner's commercial life, including one that damaged an engine,
punctured fuel tanks and left a large hole in the top of the wing. That mishap,
on June 14, 1979, sounded eerily similar to what authorities believe may have
happened just before Tuesday's crash outside Paris killing 114 people. The 1979
incident, and four less dangerous events involving Air France and British
Airways Concordes over the next two years, resulted in adoption of strict
inspection and emergency procedures.

Rwanda Completes Genocide Census
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- A unique census intended to determine exactly how may
people were slaughtered in the 1994 Rwandan genocide ended Friday, an official
said. The 11-day count was carried out by a government-appointed team of 1,600
workers who visited every family present in the country between October 1990 and
December 1994, said Protais Musoni, a spokesman for the Ministry of Local
Government and Social Affairs. At least 500,000 minority Tutsis and politically
moderate Hutus died at the hands of Hutu soldiers and militiamen during a
killing spree that began in April 1994 in this central African country. The
slaughter was orchestrated by an extremist Hutu government after President
Juvenal Habyarimana's plane was shot down on April 6 of that year.

announced the changes in ownership a day after U.S. District Court Judge Vaughn
Walker ruled out antitrust questions in Hearst's purchase of the Chronicle. The
judge also said that nothing in the law requires Hearst to give the Examiner --
or its promised subsidy of $66 million over three years -- to publisher Ted
Fang, who is closely allied with Mayor Willie Brown and other Democratic
politicians.

<HEADLINE> GOP Candidates Said Predictable  </HEADLINE>
By EUN-KYUNG KIM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An overwhelmingly white, predominantly male,
and mostly middle-aged group of delegates will nominate George W.
Bush as president at the Republican National Convention next week.
</P>
<P>
   Their ages range from 19 to 97, and while many of them work as
attorneys or politicians, they also include farmers, homemakers,
ministers and funeral home operators.
</P>
<P>
   About 83 percent of the GOP delegates who will convene Monday in
Philadelphia are white, according to interviews by The Associated
Press. Four percent are black, 1 percent Asian and 0.4 percent
Native American. About 9 percent did not respond to the question
and the remaining delegates are of mixed backgrounds or did not
divulge their races. About 3 percent of the delegates said they
were Hispanic, a category inclusive of the other races.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a dozen states are sending delegations that are
completely white.
</P>
<P>
   Males make up 61 percent of the national delegation, while
females make up 34 percent. The gender of the remaining 5 percent
of the delegates was unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The group is a well-educated bunch, with about 71 percent having
graduated from college and half of that group having taken
postgraduate work.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are the activists' activists. They are the cream of the
crop of the people who run the party,'' said Larry Sabato, a
government professor at the University of Virginia. ''The
delegations is not a mirror of America, it's a mirror of the elite
in America.''
</P>
<P>
   While Democrats have rules that require each state delegation to
be split evenly between men and women and to set goals for filling
a share of delegate slots for minorities, the Republicans have no
such rules.
</P>
<P>
   But who the delegates are is less important that what they do,
said Z. Dwight Billings, an investor from St. Louis, Mo., and one
of the few black GOP delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ''Appearances mean nothing. Appearances are not substance,'' he
said. ''The Democrats definitely look more inclusive, but if you're
looking for substance, then look at the black people who are
involved with the Republican party, because they are the ones
really involved in the serious side of business. They're not there
for show.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, 82 percent of the population is white, 13 percent
black, 4 percent Asian and .9 percent Native American, according to
the U.S. Census Bureau. The number of males and females are roughly
equal.
</P>
<P>
   Other details the AP learned about the Republican delegation:
</P>
<P>
   --The average delegate age is 47.
</P>
<P>
   --About 29 percent of all delegates hold an elective offices,
ranging from school board member to a member of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   --More than half the group will be attending the national
convention for the first time as delegates. Not among that group is
Charles Thone, of Lincoln, Neb., who has been a delegate to every
convention since 1952.
</P>
<P>
   --Married delegates make up about 74 percent of the group. The
average number of children is two, although two delegates have 12
children.
</P>
<P>
   -- Most of the delegates, 70 percent, oppose civil union-rights
and benefits for gay couples. Only 6 percent said that a state's
marriage laws should provide such rights.
</P>
<P>
   --There are four 19-year-old delegates who can claim the status
as the group's youngest members. South Carolina Sen. Strom Thurmond
is the delegation's oldest member at 97.
</P>
<P>
   Sabato said delegates typically are not large contributors or
big-time lawmakers. Rather, they are ''average people who get out
the vote, telephone and carry leaflets through the neighborhoods
and show up at the local party committee meetings that last until 2
a.m.''
</P>
<P>

   EDITOR'S NOTE -- The AP questionnaire was based on interviews
with 1,837 out of 2,066 Republican convention delegates.

<HEADLINE> Civil War Blockade Runner Excavated  </HEADLINE>
By MARY LEE GRANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   GALVESTON, Texas (AP) -- On a hot night in May 1865, a ship
slipped into Galveston Bay from the Gulf of Mexico. It was loaded
with smuggled goods from Cuba -- boots, uniforms, lead, the latest
in Paris fashions.
</P>
<P>
   Only a quarter-mile from shore, the Denbigh scraped against a
sandbar and stuck. Its mostly British crew escaped on a smaller
boat before Union soldiers blockading the Confederate port began to
shell and burn the unarmed steamer.
</P>
<P>
   It was a month after Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee had
surrendered at Appomattox. The Civil War raged on in Texas, where
rebels didn't stop fighting until June.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, researchers and students with the Texas A&AMP;M
Institute of Nautical Archaeology dug 6 feet beneath the Gulf of
Mexico's floor to pull out parts of the Denbigh's engine -- pieces
of history, which they located by studying a map from the 1880s.
</P>
<P>
   Little remains of the cargo, and the primary value of the wreck
is what it can show about how ships were built in the 1850s and
1860s.
</P>
<P>
   But the Denbigh is special: It is the only blockade runner ever
excavated and is one of the most successful in the nation's
history, said project director Barto Arnold.
</P>
<P>
   Blockade runners' owners gambled to make enormous profits during
the Civil War by slipping past a tight noose of Northern warships
to smuggle goods into the South.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are learning about an extinct breed of ship,'' Arnold said.
''This vessel represents the pinnacle of British shipbuilding
technology in the mid-19th century. When she was new in 1860, the
engineering journals praised her as opening a new age in ship
design.
</P>
<P>
   ''In 1860 she was the hottest thing around,'' he said. ''She was
the Ferrari of ships.''
</P>
<P>
   The Denbigh was designed as a tourist boat to take visitors from
Liverpool, England, to the Welsh coastal town of Rhyl. The crew may
have come partly from the English industrial towns of Manchester
and Liverpool, where cotton mills and strong trade relations with
the American South made many sympathetic to the Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   There are no crew lists for the Denbigh, Arnold said. Her
captain is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wasn't the kind of thing they kept track of, for obvious
reasons,'' he said. ''But they preferred British crew members
because they couldn't be put in prison by Union soldiers if they
were captured.''
</P>
<P>
   British researchers have found documents that show the Denbigh
reached 14 knots, or about 16 mph, on her trial run in 1860.
</P>
<P>
   In 1864 and 1865, she made 13 successful round trips between
Havana and Mobile, Ala., and Havana and Galveston.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, divers recovered the engine's 8-foot iron connection
rod, which weighs about 1,200 pounds. The rod transferred the power
of the engine to the ship's port-side paddlewheel.
</P>
<P>
   The engine parts will be cleaned and treated for preservation at
the university's Conservation Research Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The A&AMP;M research team will need at least another year to
complete its investigation. Its goal, Arnold said, is to recover
one of the engines and drive trains, including the paddlewheel,
which is 18 feet in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   The team members plan to place reconstructed artifacts in a
museum.

<HEADLINE> Court Upholds Ruling on 'Perp Walks'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A federal appeals court upheld a judge's finding
that it's unconstitutional for police to parade a criminal suspect
in front of the media for no other reason than publicity.
</P>
<P>
   But the court said the finding would likely not affect the great
majority of cases in which suspects happen to be photographed as
they are being moved by police.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a judge concluded that a burglary suspect should not
have been paraded before television cameras in 1995. The so-called
''perp walk'' -- which refers to ''perpetrator'' -- violated the
Fourth Amendment right to freedom from unreasonable searches and
seizures, the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the appeals court said the interests of the press and
the public who might want to view suspects were ''far from
negligible.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In this case, however, the press and the public were not
viewing the actual event of (the suspect) being brought to the
police station, but rather, were offered a staged re-creation,''
the court said.
</P>
<P>
   A city lawyer did not immediately return a telephone message for
comment.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Candidates Similar  </HEADLINE>
By NIKO PRICE
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- He joined the military in the
mid-1970s, rising quickly to the rank of lieutenant colonel. In
1992, he staged a coup, only to be thrown in prison. Released on a
presidential pardon, he's running for president himself on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   His name is Hugo Chavez. Or Francisco Arias.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela's presidential election is marked by the striking
similarities between the two main candidates, who fought the system
hand-in-hand and who fell out with each other only in February.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that only someone with nearly identical credentials to
Chavez could mount a real challenge to him is a testament to how
Chavez has redefined Venezuela's political landscape since his 1998
election, making violent combat of the old political order
essential baggage.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's elections are mandated by the new constitution Chavez
pushed through last year, which calls for all elected offices in
Venezuela to be ''re-legitimized'' by popular vote.
</P>
<P>
   The winning presidential candidate gets a six-year term, open to
re-election. That contrasts with the previous constitution, which
had a five-year presidential term with no immediate re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, who has won the adoration of millions with his attacks
on the rich in a country where the great majority are poor, seemed
sure to win re-election almost unchallenged.
</P>
<P>
   But Arias, taking on Chavez's own mantle of uprising against the
corrupt past, has mounted a serious campaign, decrying Chavez's
movements toward militarizing the country and saying the president
is scaring off investment with his tirades against business
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, who despite Arias' challenge holds a comfortable lead in
the polls, has responded by calling Arias a traitor, a candidate of
the rich who has allied himself with the ''corrupt, rancid
oligarchies.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the two were once so close.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, who is 46, gave up dreams of a career in baseball to
join the military. Arias, 49, signed up after studying to be a
priest.
</P>
<P>
   As soldiers, the two became friends, and together plotted to
overthrow the government of President Carlos Andres Perez. A 1992
coup ended in bloody failure, and the two -- along with three other
leaders -- were thrown into jail.
</P>
<P>
   The coup leaders were pardoned by President Rafael Caldera in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Arias got right back to work, heading up a government program
that distributed milk and helped pregnant women. He soon ran for
governor of his native Zulia state, which holds Venezuela's richest
oil reserves. He won -- and was re-elected to a second term that he
left to run for president.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, meanwhile, began touring Venezuela and other Latin
American countries in a grass-roots campaign to build support for
his Fifth Republic Movement, which grew out of the group that
organized the coup and drew on support from other leftist groups.
</P>
<P>
   Arias and the other coup leaders supported Chavez
wholeheartedly.
</P>
<P>
   They supported him when he won a crushing victory in December
1998, when his coalition dissolved the Supreme Court and Congress
and when he had a new constitution drafted for the country.
</P>
<P>
   But in February, Arias and the other two surviving leaders of
the 1992 coup broke with Chavez, saying he had betrayed the goals
of their uprising and was stifling democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Class confrontation and the pitting of rich against poor will
bring only more hunger and misery,'' Arias told The Associated
Press in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, meanwhile, called Arias' candidacy ''an ambush'' and
said it is Arias who has betrayed their past. He couldn't conceal
the personal pain behind Arias' change of allegiances.
</P>
<P>
   ''The oligarchy has taken away one more person,'' he said in his
final campaign rally. ''Betrayal has swept one more away, poison
has swept one more away.''

month, congressional Republicans seized on the chance to blame a
Clinton administration program requiring the sale of more costly,
cleaner-burning fuel.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday, a report to Congress from the Federal Trade
Commission said the stricter clean-air rules for the nation's
smoggiest cities ''seem unlikely ... to provide a complete
explanation for recent Midwestern gas price increases.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement came in an FTC status report on its investigation
into whether oil companies colluded to gouge Midwestern motorists.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC estimated it will take until after the November
elections to finish work on what has become one of the season's
hottest political issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point, no conclusions, however tentative, have been
reached,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Gas prices increased throughout the country this spring as high
crude oil prices led to an unusually tight supply situation. But in
Chicago, Milwaukee and Detroit, prices rose well above the $2 mark
-- as much as 65 cents a gallon above the national average.
</P>
<P>
   Though Midwestern motorists now are seeing prices equal to or
lower than the rest of the nation, the May-June spike touched off
charges and countercharges between Republicans and Democrats eager
to woo voters.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders mostly blamed a new phase in the Environmental
Protection Agency's reformulated gas program. They said
complications in making the new blend, especially in Chicago and
Milwaukee, where corn-based ethanol is added to make the gas burn
cleaner, were exacerbated when the Clinton administration refused
to give refiners flexibility in meeting the new standards.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and the Democrats defended the tighter rules, saying
their extra cost -- only a few pennies a gallon -- could not account
for the enormous price differential at the pump. They suggested
that oil companies might be taking advantage of the regulatory
changes to gouge the public.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC launched its formal investigation of those allegations
on June 21.
</P>
<P>
   Its interim report said the new standards may have constricted
supply because the old gas had to be drained from storage tanks,
and a dispute over a patent for making the new blend caused
confusion. In addition, St. Louis voluntarily entered the program,
increasing demand for the new blend when supplies in the region
already were tight.
</P>
<P>
   But because prices for conventional gas blends rose more
dramatically than for the reformulated fuel, the commission
concluded it was unlikely the pollution-reduction program was what
sent prices soaring.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., who has
been among the most outspoken in blaming the Clinton
administration, said the report does not change his view.
</P>
<P>
   ''The speaker never believed that the reformulated gasoline
program was the complete answer to the problem,'' said John
Feehery, Hastert's press secretary. ''But he did believe it was an
avoidable part of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The EPA said the FTC report supported the agency's contention
that cleaner gas was not responsible for the retail price spike.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen FTC attorneys, economists and investigators
working on the probe have determined there is likely no single
cause. The complete assessment will take at least three or four
more months, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   To conclude there is sufficient evidence of collusion, the probe
must find that companies made an agreement to manipulate
inventories or restrict supply.
</P>
<P>
   The American Petroleum Institute, which represents large oil
companies, said the report confirms their explanation that a number
of simultaneous events combined to create the price surge.
</P>
<P>
   ''The oil industry remains fully confident that it will be
exonerated when the FTC issues its final report,'' said API
spokesman Chris Kelley.

<HEADLINE> Cuban City Readies For Castro Speech  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Cuba (AP) -- The wooden and concrete block homes in
this central Cuban city are decorated with palm branches, Cuban
flags and the red and black banners of Fidel Castro's revolutionary
movement to set the scene for a major speech by the president.
</P>
<P>
   State media announced that Castro would speak Saturday morning
during the national event held here to commemorate the 47th
anniversary of the start of the revolution that brought him to
power on New Year's Day 1959.
</P>
<P>
   ''For Cuba, with Fidel, everyone to the plaza!'' read posters
plastered across storefronts, homes and government buildings in
this city of about 220,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   Workers finished rehabilitation work Friday on the main plaza,
which features a towering bronze statue of the revolutionary hero
Ernesto ''Che'' Guevara.
</P>
<P>
   The speech was the second of three major national events to
commemorate the anniversary of the July 26, 1953, attack by Castro
and his followers on an army barracks that launched the Cuban
Revolution against the dictatorship of then-President Fulgencio
Batista.
</P>
<P>
   Although the attackers were all either killed or jailed, the
movement later regained strength and triumphed on New Year's Day
1959 after Batista fled the country.
</P>
<P>
   The first event was a march Wednesday that drew a crowd in
Havana that the government estimated at more than 1 million.
Castro, wearing his olive green uniform and white athletic shoes,
led the 3&AMP;frac12;-mile march along Havana's Malecon coastal highway to the
U.S. Interests Section, the American mission.
</P>
<P>
   The third event will be a gathering in the eastern city of Pinar
del Rio on Aug. 5. The government has not announced if Castro will
speak at that event, but it is widely expected that he will.
</P>
<P>
   The latest string of large gatherings are part of a national
campaign to keep up the pressure on the United States to change its
policies toward Cuba in the wake of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez's
return to the communist island a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, marchers protested the 38-year U.S. trade embargo,
chanting ''Down with the blockade! Long live the homeland!''
</P>
<P>
   Usually, just one city is chosen for the central celebration,
which virtually always includes a major message from Castro. Last
year, however, the southern coastal city of Cienfuegos and the
northern coastal city of Matanzas shared the honor.
</P>
<P>
   This evidently is the first year three cities have been chosen
for celebrations marking the July 26 anniversary.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Athlete Defects To Costa Rica  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) -- A Cuban athlete visiting Costa Rica
for a sports competition defected Friday, the fourth Cuban from the
team to do so in a week, local media said.
</P>
<P>
   Ernesto Diaz Rodriguez, 30, a player on Cuba's indoor soccer
team, was receiving assistance from the Costa Rican Human Rights
Committee to obtain political asylum to stay in the Central
American country, media said.
</P>
<P>
   Players Alieth Garcia, Alain Hernandez and the team's doctor,
Gustavo Gonzalez defected a week ago. All emphasized that they do
not plan to try to enter the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials have not provided any comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban team is in Costa Rica to compete ahead of the indoor
soccer World Cup to be held Nov. 18-Dec. 3 in Guatemala City. The
draw is scheduled for August 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Indoor soccer was born on the beaches of Brazil in the 1920s and
has slowly spread around the world. It is now played on an
international level. Though not an Olympic sport, it has had three
World Cups, in 1989, 1992 and 1996, all won by Brazil.

<HEADLINE> Abortion-Rights GOP Welcomed  </HEADLINE>
By CALVIN WOODWARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Republicans extended an official welcome to
party members who favor abortion rights, then took the welcome
back.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a procedural mix up Friday night, the party's platform
committee voted to ''welcome people on all sides of this complex
issue and encourage their active participation,'' then turned
around and voted that language down.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just think, we were welcomed for about 10 or 15 minutes,''
said Ann Stone of Republicans for Choice.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the party held on to its uncompromising stand
against abortion rights and left a vocal minority on the other side
searching for ways to press their case.
</P>
<P>
   The platform generally celebrates diverse voices in the party on
issues, as it has in the past -- but not on abortion. Because of
confusion in the way the welcoming motion was presented to the
committee, some members who voted for it thought they were voting
against it, so the process was repeated.
</P>
<P>
   The platform committee finishes its work Saturday, two days
before the Republican National Convention opens.
</P>
<P>
   Finding an accommodation on abortion impossible, Republicans
began rallying around other aspects of a platform that echoes the
conservative principles and moderate tone of the party's
presumptive presidential candidate, George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion-rights Republicans were considering pressing for a
minority report in the platform if they could get at least 27
members of the 107-member platform committee to write one.
</P>
<P>
   Or they could try to bring an abortion debate to the convention
floor -- a course strongly opposed by party leaders who want to get
the issue over with and deliver Bush a united convention.
</P>
<P>
   Each option is fraught with procedural hurdles, but would be a
marked advance for advocates if achieved.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the views of Republicans who favor abortion rights were
relegated to an appendix that merely recited a series of failed
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now we're shut back out,'' Stone said. ''We'll be
exploring options to see if we can open back up again.''
</P>
<P>
   Illinois Rep. Henry Hyde was dogged on the platform committee,
fighting against giving up any ground.
</P>
<P>
   ''I plead with you not to turn your back on the unborn,'' he
said. ''I'm tired of the culture of death.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush decided months ago not to rouse the religious right by
taking it on over abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Social conservatives also toughened the platform's language
against gay rights, inserting language that opposes special legal
preference based on sexual preference.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aggressive agenda on education was put to a test in one
platform subcommittee, which approved language saying the role of
the federal government ''must be progressively limited'' in that
area.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush also emphasizes state and local control of
education, his plans call for a strong federal presence. He would
use federal dollars to reward or penalize states according to how
well their students perform on standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is not bound by the platform but his operatives have worked
hard to keep it close to his views.
</P>
<P>
   In opposing abortion and gay rights, the platform satisfies
social conservatives on the two issues most important to them, said
Gary Bauer, former candidate for the GOP nomination and longtime
activist from the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   ''In both those areas, the platform is very acceptable,'' Bauer
said.
</P>
<P>
   The platform draft maintains the plank from the 1996 campaign,
calling for a constitutional amendment that would ban abortion in
most if not all cases.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed ''human life amendment'' favored by many
conservative Republicans would allow abortion only to save the life
of the woman, although that exception is not specified in the
plank.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also favors leaving abortion legal in cases of rape or
incest but is not pushing to have those exceptions spelled out in
the platform.

<HEADLINE> Census Review Finds No Problems  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- An internal review by the Census Bureau
cleared staffers in 15 offices nationwide of allegations by a House
Republican that fraud or improper procedures occurred, the agency's
director said.
</P>
<P>
   ''After a careful review of the operations of each of the
offices listed, I find no need for any further action,'' Kenneth
Prewitt said at a Census Bureau advisory panel meeting Friday.
''None of them are out of line, or show any unusual patterns.''
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt's comments came three days after Rep. Dan Miller,
R-Fla., said a review of records from the 15 offices raised
questions about the quality of work by enumerators trying to track
down some of the 40 million households that failed to return a
form.
</P>
<P>
   Some offices had ''surges'' of responses very early in that
operation, which began April 27, while others had questionable
surges toward the end of the operation, said Miller, chairman of
the House Government Reform Committee's census panel.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt said he informed Miller by phone Thursday night of the
results of the internal review and would provide a written report
to the subcommittee next week.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since we released our letter and our analysis, there have been
more news accounts independent of the subcommittee's work where
census enumerators say there was fraud and a rush to finish at the
sacrifice of quality,'' Miller's spokesman, Chip Walker, said
Friday. Walker said they have received separate letters of
complaints from current or former enumerators.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said the questionable offices were in: Florence, Ala.;
west Atlanta; Chicago's far south and near north areas; Marion
County, Ind.; Las Vegas; Rapid City, S.D.; east Los Angeles,
Commerce and Santa Ana, Calif.; Newark, N.J.; the northwest section
of the Queens borough of New York City; the Upper East Side in the
Manhattan borough of New York City; New Castle, Del.; and north
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau finished follow-up visits to the 40 million
households a week before a July 7 deadline. Prewitt says that is
mainly because the other 80 million, or 66 percent, of the 120
million forms sent out were returned. The bureau budgeted for a 61
percent response rate this year, so overall there were more workers
available to get cases completed.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau also considers responses collected as close to
April 1 as possible to be the most accurate. Census results are
officially a ''snapshot'' of the population from that date.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt said there are 150,000 cases around the country where
the Census Bureau has had to revisit homes, including 64,000 in
Hialeah, Fla., because of procedural problems.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Framer, 38, said he worked as a census-taker the past
three months in Vineland, N.J. and New Castle, Del. He said he
informed supervisors in both offices that other Census employees
were improperly filling in answers on forms after residents either
could not or would not answer them.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything was like rush, rush, rush, and it's not a case
where you can rush everything,'' said Framer, who left the job two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Census spokesman Steve Jost said quality control checks by
local, regional and national superiors showed nothing unusual in
New Castle.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing that indicates ''procedures were shortened or
that procedures were not followed, or that there was any indication
of any problems,'' said Philadelphia Regional Director Fernando
Armstrong, who oversees New Castle.

<HEADLINE> FBI Files Figure Admits Lying  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prosecutors say they have no evidence that
anyone in the Clinton White House misused FBI background files of
former Republican appointees even though a key figure in the
controversy admitted he lied to Congress and a federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors' final report disclosed Friday that
then-Independent Counsel Ken Starr, in an effort to get to the
bottom of whether the Clinton White House had waged a
dirt-gathering campaign against political opponents, granted
immunity from prosecution to Anthony Marceca, the Army detailee who
got hundreds of background files from the FBI in 1993-94, some of
them ex-employees and officials of the Reagan and Bush eras.
</P>
<P>
   Marceca said he testified falsely to the grand jury and the
House Government Reform and Oversight Committee in 1996 by denying
he knew that some of the names on the outdated Secret Service list
that he was relying on didn't even have White House passes anymore.
Marceca's admissions were disclosed in the report of Starr's
successor, Robert Ray. A special appeals court released the
document.
</P>
<P>
   ''Perjury and selective memory loss in congressional
investigations are a growing problem,'' said Rep. Dan Burton,
chairman of the House committee that Marceca testified falsely to
four years ago. ''Anthony Marceca lied to Congress and it's
disappointing that he won't be punished.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton, R-Ind., said that in the course of various committee
investigations, ''we've had scores of witnesses suffer from
selective memory loss. We've referred witnesses to the Justice
Department for lying under oath. They haven't been prosecuted. If
the laws aren't enforced, this problem will only get worse.''
Granting immunity to Marceca made it impossible to prosecute him
for his previous answers.
</P>
<P>
   Marceca told Starr's office he gave ''obviously false''
testimony when he told committee investigators that he didn't read
various background reports obtained from the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Marceca said his boss, White House security office director
Craig Livingstone, ''told him to review the reports for derogatory
information that might reflect on suitability for White House
employment,'' said the final report. Marceca told Starr's office he
looked for ''previous arrests ... that sort of stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes and highlighting that Marceca made on the records of 10
people who no longer worked at the White House ''reflected
commentary on ... reported arrests, credit history information as
well as political affiliation,'' added the report by Independent
Counsel Robert Ray, Starr's successor.
</P>
<P>
   But Marceca insisted that he reported derogatory information to
Livingstone just three times, and prosecutors uncovered no
information suggesting that White House officials or first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton were involved in Marceca's requests.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Independent Counsel's determination'' is that ''no
conspiracy existed,'' said the final report which detailed findings
that Ray publicly announced in March.
</P>
<P>
   Marceca said he made the requests of the FBI because he thought
the people whose background files he was requesting needed White
House access.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no evidence that Mr. Marceca knew'' otherwise, said
the final report. Marceca's lawyers attributed ''inconsistencies''
in their client's statements primarily to ''confusion'' between
Marceca and his interrogators concerning ''the purport of the
questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray's conclusions constitute ''a political report issued by a
political prosecutor,'' said Larry Klayman, head of the
conservative group Judicial Watch, which has filed numerous
lawsuits against the Clinton administration. Ray ''didn't question
most of the primary witnesses including former White House counsel
Bernard Nussbaum,'' who was investigated for possible false
testimony in the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ''To have found against the Clintons would have been bad for
Ray's political future,'' Klayman said.

<HEADLINE> Fire Contained Near Nuke Facility  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   IDAHO FALLS, Idaho (AP) -- Firefighters were able to surround a
30,000-acre blaze on Friday that had forced the evacuation of
hundreds of employees at a nuclear facility.
</P>
<P>
   The fire just outside the Idaho National Engineering and
Environmental Laboratory was the third fire this year to threaten
one of the nation's nuclear facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Decreasing winds overnight quelled the flames, and Friday
afternoon fire crews built a second fire line to contain it. About
1,800 lab workers ordered out of three buildings on Thursday were
able to return to their jobs Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The lab's Advanced Test Reactor was being repaired and its
operations weren't affected, laboratory spokeswoman Stacey Francis
said. Utility crews were busy replacing 52 electrical poles damaged
by the fire, and tests were being done to measure any radioactive
release.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier fires, at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New
Mexico and the Hanford nuclear reservation in Washington, had
raised concerns about the release of radioactive material, but
federal officials have said there has been no danger. Air samples
showed an increased -- but not harmful -- concentration of plutonium
in public areas outside the Hanford reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the West, fires charred wildland in what has become
the nation's worst fire season since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In California, evacuations were ordered as a fire blackened
37,000 acres of the Sequoia National Forest, creeping up to several
homes on the forest's borders Friday. More than 100 residents were
forced to evacuate the area 120 miles north of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Low humidity and blustery winds helped double the blaze in size
in a 24-hour period, said Doug Johnson, a Kern County fire
engineer. The fire was only about 10 percent contained Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This fire has shown extreme behavior,'' Forest Service
spokesman Tony Diffenbaugh said.
</P>
<P>
   Eight firefighters suffered minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   In Mesa Verde National Park in Colorado, a 40-mile fire line was
keeping a 23,000-acre wildfire from spreading, and the park's
archaeological treasures were safe, park officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Utah division of the Bureau of Land Management said a
12,000-acre fire near Leamington, 87 miles south of Salt Lake City,
was about 40 percent contained. At least four fires in the
Wasatch-Cache National Forest had burned nearly 2,100 acres, and
300 firefighters were working to control it Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, firefighters were able Friday to contain a
6,500-acre range fire in the Columbia River Gorge that had
threatened wheat crops and a Yakama Nation ceremonial site. Farmers
had cut their own fire trails with tractors, trying to protect
crops from the blaze about 12 miles southeast of Goldendale.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still have some hot areas the crews want to keep an eye on,
but it's looking pretty good,'' said Tammie Wilson, a state
Department of Natural Resources spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the origin of the fire was suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters in Montana were nearing containment of a fire that
burned about 17,500 acres east of Helena in the scenic Canyon Ferry
Lake region and forced about 300 families from the homes.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, wind fueled a 3,500-acre fire on the Fort Apache
Indian Reservation to 5,000 acres in about three hours Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A makeshift camp for firefighters had to be moved because the
fire was advancing unpredictably, said fire spokeswoman Chadeen
Palmer. Flames reached heights of 100 feet, and the fire was
threatening a power line to the tiny community of Cibecue.

   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Mo Vaughn capped a seven-run sixth inning
with a tiebreaking three-run homer as the Anaheim Angels rallied
from a five-run deficit Friday night to beat the Chicago White Sox
10-7.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Sirotka took a 7-3 lead into the sixth, then allowed Tim
Salmon's leadoff homer.
</P>
<P>
   Sirotka gave up three more hits, including Adam Kennedy's second
RBI single of the game, and reliever Kevin Beirne (1-1) loaded the
bases by hitting Bengie Gil with his first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Darin Erstad's sacrifice fly and Kevin Stocker's RBI single tied
it, and Vaughn hit a 3-0 pitch 430 feet to right-center for his
26th homer.
</P>
<P>
   Winner Mike Holtz (1-2) threw just two pitches, retiring Chris
Singleton to end the sixth with two on.
</P>
<P>
   Shigetoshi Hasegawa pitched two scoreless innings, extending his
shutout streak to 18 1-3 innings, and Troy Percival got three outs
for his 24th save in 31 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Garret Anderson hit his 30th homer as the Angels avoided what
would have been their first four-game losing streak this season.
Chicago lost for the sixth time in eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Sirotka, in his first start after agreeing to a $6.8 million,
two-year contract extension, allowed seven runs -- six earned -- and
eight hits in 5 1-3 innings. Anaheim's Ken Hill gave up seven runs
and 11 hits in 5 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago took a 5-0 lead in the second on Paul Konerko's homer,
Herbert Perry's two-run double, Jose Valentin's RBI double and a
run-scoring bloop single by Magglio Ordonez, who drove in three
runs.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim got a pair of runs in the bottom half on a passed ball
by Brook Fordyce with a runner on third and Adam Kennedy's RBI
single.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's homer made it 5-3 in the fourth, but Ordonez hit a
two-run single off Mike Fyhrie in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Anderson and Troy Glaus are only the third tandem in the
Angels' 40-year history to hit 30 or more homers each in the same
season. It also happened in 1979 with Don Baylor and Bobby Grich,
and in 1995 with Tim Salmon and Jim Edmonds. ... Erstad's next
homer would give the Angels five players with 20 or more homers in
the same season for the fourth time. It also happened in 1995,
1992, and the team's inaugural 1961 season. ... Gil started at DH
for the first time in 345 major league games and was 1-for-2. It
was only the sixth time Anaheim manager Mike Scioscia batted his
starting DH bat ninth and when they do, they are 2-for-15 with one
RBI. ... Sirotka allowed more than three earned runs for only the
second time in his last 15 starts.

<HEADLINE> Rangers 11, Tigers 5  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- When Juan Gonzalez was traded to Detroit
in the offseason, Texas Rangers reliever Tim Crabtree made some
negative comments about the slugger.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the hard feelings still linger.
</P>
<P>
   Crabtree's inside fastball to Gonzalez nearly touched off a
brawl in the Rangers' 11-5 victory over the Tigers on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Crabtree threw a chest-high fastball to Gonzalez in the seventh
inning, angering the Tigers star. Gonzalez gestured at Crabtree and
took a couple of quick steps toward the mound before being
restrained by catcher Bill Haselman, Gonzalez's longtime friend
from their minor league days.
</P>
<P>
   The dugouts and bullpens emptied but no punches were thrown.
</P>
<P>
   ''When the Rangers traded me, he talked in the papers,''
Gonzalez said of Crabtree. ''I don't talk like that. I talk man to
man. He was sending a message to me by throwing me close.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the Gonzalez trade, Crabtree was quoted in a Michigan
newspaper as saying, ''He's their problem now.''
</P>
<P>
   Crabtree said there was no message behind inside pitch. He said
he was merely trying to prevent Gonzalez from hitting a homer with
runners on first and second and the Rangers in front, 10-5.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was not my intention to throw at him,'' Crabtree said.
''Juan has a lot of power. The last thing I want him to do is get
his hands extended and hit a three-run homer. I was trying to tie
him up inside and get a groundball.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was kind of surprised he reacted the way he did. Things
escalated and got out of hand. Juan's a great player. But he's a
Tiger now and I need to get him out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Former teammate Rafael Palmeiro said Gonzalez is still coming to
grips with the deal almost eight months after it happened.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got to understand, he was hurt by the trade,'' Palmeiro
said. ''He comes back and the pitcher throws inside. Sure he thinks
there's a message. That made him upset. But that's what we talked
about doing. Crabby needed to throw inside to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Haselman's three-run double highlighted an eight-run third
inning. Frank Catalanotto homered and Gabe Kapler hit an RBI double
as Texas won its fourth in a row. All three players were part of
the offseason trade that sent Gonzalez to Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Helling (12-7) won his fifth consecutive decision. He
allowed five runs and eight hits in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers remain in last place in the AL West, but they don't
think they're out of the race. Texas moved within a game of .500
for the first time since early July.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can never tell what will happen,'' said Helling. ''We
still feel we have a shot at the playoffs if we can put a long
streak together. We've got 61 games left. We've still got a
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Dean Palmer hit his 19th home run as the Tigers took a 3-0 lead
in the first. Texas got a run in the bottom half against Brian
Moehler (6-7) on Rafael Palmeiro's RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   Catalanotto hit a solo homer in the second. The Rangers broke
open the game in the third with their biggest inning of the season,
highlighted by Haselman's three-run double.
</P>
<P>
   Royce Clayton and Luis Alicea added RBI singles and Chad Curtis
had a two-run double to chase Moehler. Kapler's RBI double off
reliever Nelson Cruz extended Texas' lead to 10-3.
</P>
<P>
   Moehler, 5-2 with a 2.49 ERA in seven previous career starts
against Texas, was tagged for 10 runs and 11 hits in 2 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit narrowed the gap to 10-5 in the fourth on Juan
Encarnacion's two-run homer. Mike Lamb homered for Texas in the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Rangers' eight-run inning was their biggest since an
eight-run outburst on Sept. 25, 1999, against Oakland. ... Texas DH
David Segui was scratched from the starting lineup, and was traded
to Cleveland a few hours later for outfielder Ricky Ledee. Ledee
will join the Rangers Saturday night and is expected to be the
starting right fielder for most of the rest of the season. ...
Moehler had his earliest knockout of the season.

<HEADLINE> Indians Get Wickman, Cordero, Segui  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Desperately trying to get back into the pennant
chase, the Cleveland Indians made three deals Friday that got them
three new pitchers and two new hitters.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Indians obtained closer Bob Wickman and starters
Steve Woodard and Jason Bere from the Milwaukee Brewers Friday for
slugger Richie Sexson, rookie right-handers Paul Rigdon and Kane
Davis and a player to be named.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Indians brought back outfielder Wil Cordero, who became
a free agent after last season, acquiring him from Pittsburgh for
outfielder Alex Ramirez and infielder Enrique Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Topping off the night, the Indians got first baseman David Segui
from Texas for Ricky Ledee, acquired just last month by Cleveland
from the Yankees in the David Justice trade.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically, Segui can play first base, left field, right field,
and Wil can play left field and DH,'' Indians manager Charlie
Manuel said. ''It's important we get Manny Ramirez back in right
field playing defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The deals allow the Indians to move around first baseman Jim
Thome.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to make a DH out of Thome,'' Manuel said.
''He'll play some DH, he'll play some left field and possibly play
some right field.''
</P>
<P>
   Indians general manager John Hart announced the Milwaukee deal
during a news conference at Jacobs Field. Cleveland's game at
Baltimore was rained out later Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   With injuries ravaging its pitching staff, Cleveland, which has
won five straight AL Central titles, has struggled all season and
is 10 games behind division-leading Chicago and 2&AMP;frac12; games behind
Oakland in the AL wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   Woodard and Bere will immediately move into the Indians starting
rotation, Hart said, replacing Charles Nagy and Jaret Wright, who
are both on the disabled list and may not be back until September.
</P>
<P>
   ''To be able in one trade to replenish 30 percent of your
pitching staff is a good deal for us -- not only for the 2000 season
but with pieces that are going to be able to play for us beyond
2000,'' said Hart, who came close to getting Curt Schilling from
Philadelphia last week before the Phillies traded their ace to
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Bere will start Saturday in Baltimore, Hart said.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel was delighted to add Cordero and Segui to a lineup that
ranks seventh in the AL in runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are professional hitters,'' Manuel said. ''To me, our
ballclub got better -- especially offensively.''
</P>
<P>
   Ledee was shocked to hear that he was traded for a second time
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you're not established in the big leagues, it's going to
happen. It's happened to me two times in less than a month,'' he
said. ''When you're getting used to your players and you're
friends, you're gone. You have to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Wickman, selected to the NL All-Star team earlier this month,
has 16 saves. The 31-year-old, who is signed through 2001, is 2-2
with a 2.93 ERA in 43 games, all in relief.
</P>
<P>
   ''He can be a setup man or a closer,'' Manuel said. ''Right now
he's going to be our closer.''
</P>
<P>
   Wickman, a Wisconsin native, was disappointed by the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''The trade hurts, that's all I can say,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It might also hurt the fans who planned to come to County
Stadium on Saturday to receive their free Bob Wickman posters.
</P>
<P>
   Bere, a 29-year-old right-hander who is eligible for free agency
after the season, is 6-7 with a 4.93 ERA in 20 starts. Woodard, a
25-year-old right-hander, is 1-7 with a 5.96 ERA in 11 starts and
16 relief appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm excited about the opportunity to get to Cleveland and have
a chance to possibly get to the postseason,'' Bere said.
</P>
<P>
   Sexson, 25, became a regular starter in 1999 and hit .255 with
31 homers and 116 RBIs. But the 6-foot-8 Sexson, who is more
comfortable playing first base than the outfield, slumped this
season to a .256 average with 16 homers and 44 RBIs. He has 96
strikeouts in 324 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is no secret that we have been trying to acquire another
bat for the middle of our lineup,'' Brewers GM Dean Taylor said.
''Anytime you have the ability to acquire a player coming off a
31-home run, 116-RBI season last year, you certainly have to be
delighted with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, 25, made his major league debut last month and is 0-3
with a 14.73 ERA in two starts and three relief appearances
covering 11 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Rigdon, 24, was sent to the minors when Davis was brought up on
June 28. Rigdon was 1-1 with a 7.64 ERA in five games for the
Indians, who had brought him up from Triple-A Buffalo on May 19.
</P>
<P>
   They were just two of six pitchers who to make their major
league debuts this season for the Indians, who have already set a
franchise record by using 27 pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ''This gives our club an opportunity to right itself and to play
meaningful games in August and September which is what we promise
our fans every year,'' Hart said. ''We've had tremendous injuries
but this is still a team we all believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   Cordero, 28, was hitting .282 with 16 home runs and 51 RBIs in
89 games as the Pirates' starting left fielder. He played last year
in Cleveland, hitting .299 with eight homers and 32 RBIs in a
season shortened by a broken left wrist.

<HEADLINE> Mariners 7, Blue Jays 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Freddy Garcia won for the first time in five
starts since coming off the disabled list as the Seattle Mariners
beat the Toronto Blue Jays 7-4 to snap a three-game losing streak
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia (3-1) allowed four runs and six hits in 6 2-3 innings,
striking out a season-high eight batters. Garcia, who missed 2&AMP;frac12;
months with a broken right leg, had a 1.75 ERA four starts without
a decision since coming off the DL on July 7.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays took a 4-3 lead behind Jose Cruz Jr.'s three-run
homer in the third inning before the Mariners rallied with three
runs in the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Rickey Henderson and Mark McLemore led off the inning with
singles off Chris Carpenter (7-10). A one-out walk to Edgar
Martinez loaded the bases and knocked out Carpenter.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Halladay came in and walked John Olerud and hit Jay Buhner
with a pitch, giving the Mariners the lead. Mike Cameron's RBI
groundout made it 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Kazuhiro Sasaki pitched the ninth for his 25th save in 27
chances, and 15th consecutive save conversion.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz's 22nd homer and back-to-back doubles by Carlos Delgado and
Brad Fullmer gave Toronto a 4-2 lead in the third.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners closed within one run in their half on a sacrifice
fly by Cameron.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle scored twice in the second on RBI singles by Dan Wilson
and David Bell.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Seattle has won four of five games against Toronto. ...
Delgado hit his major league-leading 38th and 39th doubles in the
first and third innings and has doubled in six consecutive games.
... Olerud has walked with the bases loaded four times this season.
Seattle has drawn 24 bases-loaded walks. ... Buhner improved to
9-for-12 (.750) lifetime against Carpenter by going 2-for-2. ...
Carpenter lasted just 3 1-3 innings for the second time this season
against the Mariners, allowing six earned runs and raising his ERA
to 18.90 in two starts Friday against Seattle.

<HEADLINE> 6 Dead, 80 Injured at Fujimori Oath  </HEADLINE>
By MONTE HAYES
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- When the smoke and tear gas cleared after
President Alberto Fujimori's inauguration, key government buildings
smoldered, six people lay dead and dozens were injured.
</P>
<P>
   But the long-term effects appeared to be both a new blot on
Fujimori's already tarnished record and a setback for the
opposition, which failed to keep its promise of a nonviolent
demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   ''If what we seek is to build a democratic society we must
proceed in an orderly way, with prudence and without veering from
the path,'' Fujimori told Congress on Friday during his inaugural
speech for an unprecedented third five-year term.
</P>
<P>
   ''The armed forces and police should reconcile themselves to the
new period of peace that characterizes our nation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, seven blocks away, hundreds of protesters chanting
''There is no president!'' fought with riot police, who fired tear
gas directly into the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   As the street fighting spread, three air force fighter jets in
formation swooped ominously low over Lima's historic center.
</P>
<P>
   Six bank guards died in a blaze, allegedly started by
demonstrators, that destroyed the state-run Banco de la Nacion.
</P>
<P>
   Alejandro Toledo, the former opposition candidate, boycotted the
May 28 presidential runoff, claiming it was rigged in Fujimori's
favor. He laid most of the blame for Friday's violence on
infiltrators from the National Intelligence Service.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can tell you that our program has been peaceful.
Nevertheless, we were met with brutal repression,'' Toledo said.
''We have received information that the intelligence service
penetrated the marchers with 100 agents who provoked acts of
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Fernando Dianderas called Toledo's accusations ''an insult
to the intelligence of the Peruvian people.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I deny it emphatically,'' he said during a news conference
confirming the deaths of the bank guards.
</P>
<P>
   Julio Carrion, a Peruvian political scientist at the University
of Delaware, said he believed the intelligence service likely had
''a hand'' in some of the violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''But it would be disingenuous to blame everything on the
intelligence service,'' said Carrion, speaking by telephone from
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, he said, the violence could signal a resurgence of
''heavy-handed tactics'' by Fujimori to retain his grip on power.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo also suggested that Fujimori was attempting to ''turn up
the political temperature to justify another act for the government
to continue independently of democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a veiled reference to 1992, when Fujimori suspended the
constitution and shut down Congress. At the time, he justified the
move as necessary to defeat the Maoist Shining Path insurgency and
to launch aggressive free-market economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Peruvians had mobilized from across the country for the protest,
dubbed the ''March of the Four Suyos'' -- an allusion to the four
corners of the ancient Incan empire.
</P>
<P>
   For days, demonstrators trickled into Lima aboard trucks and
buses from the countryside, sleeping in open-air tent camps and
eating from communal stewpots.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to tell the world that we aren't the violent ones,''
said demonstrator Cesar Veldez, a 24-year-old education student.
</P>
<P>
   Half a block away, the Banco de la Nacion was destroyed. Across
the street, guards from the National Election Board building, which
also was set ablaze, escaped by shimmying down a long, twisted
window curtain from the second story.
</P>
<P>
   ''We tried to march peacefully -- for two days we've been
marching -- and today they fired tear gas right at us, directly at
our bodies,'' Veldez said.
</P>
<P>
   The fires burned out of control for two hours before fire trucks
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   About 40,000 police officers had been called out, and the office
of the human rights ombudsman said at least 80 people were detained
when the violence ended.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's vow Friday to protect the constitution provoked jeers
from opposition congressmen, who accuse him of violating it many
times during his decade in power.
</P>
<P>
   Other opposition members held a sign that read ''Majority
Bought,'' a reference to accusations that Fujimori regained control
of the legislature by paying opposition lawmakers to jump ship and
give his alliance a majority.

<HEADLINE> Soldier Pleads Guilty To Rape  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT BRAGG, N.C. (AP) -- An Army soldier scheduled to stand trial
next week on charges of raping and killing an 11-year-old ethnic
Albanian girl in Kosovo has pleaded guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Staff Sgt. Frank J. Ronghi, whose court-martial was to begin
Monday in Wuerzberg, Germany, pleaded guilty to premeditated
murder, forcible sodomy, and indecent acts with a child.
</P>
<P>
   Ronghi, 36, and his defense lawyers unexpectedly entered the
plea Friday evening after meeting with a judge to discuss
procedures for the court-martial.
</P>
<P>
   Ronghi's sentencing was scheduled for 1 p.m. Monday in Germany.
He faces a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole, a
dishonorable discharge, reduction to private, and forfeiture of all
pay and allowances.
</P>
<P>
   Ronghi was charged with killing Merita Shabiu on Jan. 13 in the
basement of an apartment building and burying her body in the snow
near the town of Vitina. He was arrested just days after the
killing.
</P>
<P>
   Ronghi, from Niles, Ohio, was a weapons squad leader assigned to
the 3rd Battalion, 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment at Fort Bragg.
He was serving with a U.S. peacekeeping force from Germany at the
time of the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's death raised tensions between peacekeeping troops in
Kosovo and ethnic Albanians. Ethnic Albanians in the province
already had been critical of other alleged mistreatment, including
inappropriate body searches of women since the 50,000-person
NATO-led force entered Kosovo in June 1999.

<HEADLINE> Bush Taunts Clinton on Way to RNC  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOPLIN, Mo. (AP) -- GOP presidential hopeful George W. Bush is
showing off his poll standing in states that voted Democratic four
years ago, even as he courts the same voters who chose President
Clinton in the last two elections.
</P>
<P>
   As some national polls show the Texas governor widening his lead
over Vice President Al Gore just days before the GOP convention,
Bush headed to Kentucky and Ohio, two key states with 29 electoral
votes between them.
</P>
<P>
   But still dogging Bush are Democratic attacks on the running
mate he announced Tuesday, former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Intensifying their criticism of Cheney's record and his ties to
the oil industry, aides to Gore are citing published remarks Cheney
made last year welcoming OPEC's agreement to cut production -- a
deal that played a part in the recent rise in oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been struck by the extent OPEC seems to have gotten its
act together,'' said Cheney at an April 1999 energy conference in
New Orleans. ''A certain amount of near-term optimism is
justified.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney is chief executive officer of Halliburton Corp., a huge
Dallas-based oil services conglomerate. He plans to resign that
post on Aug. 16.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is only further evidence that a Bush-Cheney ticket would
turn the oval office into the oil office,'' said Gore spokesman
Chris Lehane.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since he put Cheney on the GOP ticket, Bush
did not strike back at the Democrats' specific charges on Friday,
instead praising Cheney's accomplishments and integrity.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said that Cheney was talking
to his corporate constituents at the time -- an oil industry
audience -- ''and members of the industry obviously did hope prices
would be strong. The oil industry had been in a terrible
depression, forced to lay off thousands of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney was silent about the attacks on Friday, staying within
the safer realm of introducing Bush at confetti-and-rock'n roll
rallies in Springdale, Ark. and Joplin, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the campaign believes a flurry of new national polls
shows the Democrats' fierce attacks on Cheney have fallen flat in
the days leading up to the Republican National Convention, which
opens on Monday in Philadelphia. The surveys showed mixed reactions
to Cheney's addition to the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Among the results:
</P>
<P>
   --A Time magazine poll conducted since Cheney joined Bush's
ticket showed Bush has widened his lead over Al Gore to from 10
points a week ago to 16 percentage points in a four-way matchup
against Green Party nominee Ralph Nader and Reform Party hopeful
Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   --A CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll, conducted Tuesday and Wednesday
found the Republican ticket with an 11-point lead over Gore in a
four-way matchup. Gore had closed the gap with Bush just a week ago
in the same poll. Candidates often see a rise in their poll ratings
during their party's convention, and sometimes even before it
starts. But two post-Cheney polls released Friday found no movement
for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   --A Fox News/Opinion Dynamics poll conducted Wednesday and
Thursday showed Bush ahead by six points in a four-way race,
virtually unchanged from two weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   --A CBS News-New York Times poll conducted Thursday showed
similar results, with Bush at 45 percent to 41 percent for Gore,
virtually unchanged from earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in interviews with ABC, Bush called Democratic criticism
of his running mate and of the selection process ''absurd. ... If
Al Gore thinks he can win the election by tearing down Dick Cheney,
he's in for an incredible surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he and Cheney make a great team because ''he doesn't
talk much and I do.'' Cheney conceded he was reticent. ''I'm not
going to set the house on fire, but I don't have to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, meanwhile, tinkered with his convention speech and laid
out his post-convention plans. They include riding out of
Philadelphia on a train trip through Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan
and Illinois Aug. 5 through 7, Hughes said.

<HEADLINE> Ventura Heads To Mining School  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EVELETH, Minn. (AP) -- After stumbling on national television
while trying to define taconite, Gov. Jesse Ventura and an
entourage of Minnesota Cabinet members are heading to the Iron
Range next week for some schooling.
</P>
<P>
   The visit will include a history and introduction of mining.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to get them better educated with northeastern
Minnesota,'' said Iron Range Resources and Rehabilitation Board
Chairman John Swift.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura put in a plug for the range during an appearance last
month on Jay Leno's ''Tonight Show.'' He told Leno about LTV Steel
Mining Co.'s imminent closing in Hoyt Lakes -- and the 1,400 jobs
that would go with it.
</P>
<P>
   But then Leno asked what taconite was. The material is a
low-grade form of iron ore that is refined into higher-grade
pellets used to make steel.
</P>
<P>
   ''Taconite is those little, like kind of iron balls that they
make things out of, I guess,'' Ventura explained. ''I'm not an
expert on it, I'm just the governor.''

<HEADLINE> Gates Give Harvard $45M For Research  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Bill and Melinda Gates are giving Harvard Medical
School nearly $45 million to fight drug-resistant strains of
tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
   It's the largest private donation ever to combat the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard says it will use the five-year grant to join other
groups, including the World Health Organization and U.S. Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, in fighting TB in Peru.
</P>
<P>
   Peru has a pilot program that can cure patients with
drug-resistant TB at a fraction of what it costs to treat them in
the United States, Harvard said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gates Foundation wanted to expand that program so other
countries could use it as a model, the school said.
</P>
<P>
   TB is a highly infectious bacterial disease spread by coughing.
It attacks the lungs and kills more than 2 million people every
year.

<HEADLINE> Darryl Strawberry's Cancer is Back  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Darryl Strawberry's cancer has returned.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees slugger was diagnosed with colon cancer in
1998 and underwent surgery and chemotherapy. In January, he said a
test showed his colon was free of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday his agent, Eric Grossman, said a CT scan suggests
the cancer has spread to Strawberry's lymph nodes. Strawberry is to
undergo more tests next week.
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old outfielder would not comment on the possibility
that he violated probation stemming from drug and sex charges in
1999 by leaving a drug clinic early.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry said his first priority would be to fight his cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Physically, I have some situations coming up right now that's
going to be real difficult for me,'' Strawberry said without
elaborating. ''So I have to deal with them at this point.''

   PROVO, Utah (AP) -- As Brigham Young University student who
appeared on MTV's ''Real World'' has been suspended from the
school.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Stoffer, a business major from Delafield, Wis., spent five
months being filmed for the reality TV show in which she lived with
four men and two other women in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   She was suspended for the fall semester because she broke the
school's honor code. The Mormon school prohibits single students
from living with members of the opposite sex.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a decision if she was a good or bad person. But it
is about her commitment to the honor code,'' BYU spokeswoman Carri

   Last month, Stoffer said BYU officials should go by the spirit
of the law, not the letter of the law.

<HEADLINE> Concorde Blown Tire Probed  </HEADLINE>
By JOCELYN GECKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Investigators are considering whether the explosion
of a tire on the Air France Concorde could have triggered the
events that led to an engine breakdown and fiery crash minutes
after takeoff, killing 114 people.
</P>
<P>
   A tire blew out on the supersonic jet's undercarriage as it
raced down the runway at Charles de Gaulle airport, France's
Transport Ministry confirmed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, police discovered the corpse of another victim
buried beneath the rubble of a hotel struck by the jet. Officials
raised the death toll to 114 after discovering the body, whose
gender and nationality could not immediately be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Four other bystanders died when the plane slammed into the hotel
in the town of Gonesse.
</P>
<P>
   Blown-out tires have been blamed for past brushes with
near-disaster, despite Concorde's seemingly spotless safety record.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board reported
four ''potentially catastrophic'' incidents resulting from blown
out tires during Concorde takeoffs between June 1979 and February
1981.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious occurred in June 1979 at Dulles airport outside
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   As a Concorde was taking off, two tires on the main left landing
gear blew out and tire debris and wheel shrapnel damaged the No. 2
engine and punctured three fuel tanks. A large hole was torn in the
wing.
</P>
<P>
   The plane returned to the airport for an emergency landing with
fuel pouring from the wing. Design modifications were made after
the incident, along with an NTSB recommendation that landing gear
not be retracted if a blowout occurs and that any plane suffering a
blowout immediately return for an emergency landing at the airport
where it took off.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary report on Tuesday's crash is due to be published
at the end of August, but just three days after the tragedy, a
sketchy image of the sequence of events has surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   ''At least one tire exploded, which could have triggered a chain
of events, structural damages, a fire and an engine breakdown,''
the Transport Ministry said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The ministry's Accident and Inquiry Office said one or two of
the wheels on the left side landing gear may have blown out and
that the fire that ravaged the jetliner did not necessarily start
in the engines.
</P>
<P>
   An initial report from the ministry Thursday had raised the
specter of something as mundane as a puncture being involved. It
said tire debris had been found strewn along the plane's runway.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say a piece of tire in the engine during takeoff could
cause serious damage.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators know that engine No. 2 failed, that the pilot
could not draw up the undercarriage and that engine No. 1 lost
power -- once on the runway, and again, fatally, less than one
minute into the flight. The Concorde has four engines, two under
each wing.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 100 passengers aboard flight AF4590 were German
tourists headed to New York to board a luxury cruise to the
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and colleagues of the nine crew members who died in the
crash attended a memorial service Friday at Air France's
headquarters at the Charles de Gaulle airport.
</P>
<P>
   Speakers praised the crew's professionalism. Many of the
mourners bowed their heads, others cried in their handkerchiefs.
One woman fainted.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a very moving ceremony,'' said Gerard Feldzer, an Air
France pilot. ''Each one of us was touched.''
</P>
<P>
   In Gonesse, residents walked silently in a procession from the
town hall toward the site where the Concorde went down in a ball of
fire.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Jean-Pierre Blazy walked at the front with the owner of
the destroyed hotel, Michele Fricheteau, whose arms were wrapped in
white bandages and face was scattered with burns.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're still in shock. It's a time for reverent silence, pain
and emotion,'' Blazy said.
</P>
<P>
   Transport Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot, who has grounded all Air
France Concorde flights, said Friday he wanted across-the-board
supplementary security procedures before allowing the supersonic
jets to take to the sky again.
</P>
<P>
   Air France said its jets would remain grounded until further
notice.

5 Early Concorde Incidents Cited
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Blown tires on the European-built Concorde supersonic
planes caused five ''potentially catastrophic'' incidents in the first two years
of the luxury airliner's commercial life, including one that damaged an engine,
punctured fuel tanks and left a large hole in the top of the wing. That mishap,
on June 14, 1979, sounded eerily similar to what authorities believe may have
happened just before Tuesday's crash outside Paris killing 114 people. The 1979
incident, and four less dangerous events involving Air France and British
Airways Concordes over the next two years, resulted in adoption of strict
inspection and emergency procedures.

<HEADLINE> McCain To Tout Bush in Bus Tour  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John McCain, defeated in the primaries but
still seeking the spotlight, prepared Saturday to travel to the
Republican convention in a campaign-style bus caravan.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator is now campaigning for his former rival,
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, but McCain is keeping a schedule fit for
a candidate. After a planned rolling press conference from
Washington to Philadelphia, McCain will campaign for a
congressional candidate, speak at a rival ''shadow convention,''
address his delegates and speak to the convention in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   All of it, McCain says, is for the greater glory of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's certainly not any intention'' of stealing the
limelight from Bush, McCain said Wednesday. ''I've talked with
Governor Bush and he's pleased with what I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   After the convention, McCain plans to join Bush on a campaign
swing through the West, hosting Bush for a night at his ranch near
Sedona, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was Bush's toughest competitor in the GOP primaries,
drawing independent-minded voters with calls for trimming the
influence of money in politics.
</P>
<P>
   McCain won seven primaries and had 231 delegates before he ended
his presidential bid in March. Some of those delegates have been
replaced by Bush supporters or have already pledged themselves to
Bush, and McCain plans to tell his remaining delegates at a Sunday
afternoon meeting to support Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anyone who is missing from my speech to them will lose their
(convention) credentials,'' McCain added jokingly.
</P>
<P>
   First on the agenda Saturday afternoon is a town-hall campaign
event with Pennsylvania state Sen. Stewart Greenleaf, a Republican
trying to displace Democratic Rep. Joseph Hoeffel. Greenleaf is one
of more than 125 House candidates who have asked for McCain's
campaign help -- assistance McCain hopes will prevent Democrats from
gaining the six House seats they need to win a majority.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he (McCain) is very well liked in this suburban
district,'' said Greenleaf, who will be making his fourth campaign
appearance with McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Before McCain meets with his delegates Sunday, he will address
the shadow convention organized by satirists, campaign finance
reform advocates and others. While some Republicans grumble that
speaking there is giving aid and comfort to the enemy, McCain said
he will try to win more voters for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''You win elections by winning the center,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Also on tap for Sunday: an interview on CBS' Face the Nation, a
speech to a pro-Israel group and a book signing for his
best-selling autobiography, which chronicles the five years he
spent as a prisoner of war in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's events include an appearance on MTV and a news
conference with Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, McCain will address the convention at 10:30 p.m.
Eastern time.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers think that, despite his denials, McCain is laying
the groundwork for a presidential run in 2004, should Bush lose
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's not acting like a candidate, he is a candidate,'' said
University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato.

<HEADLINE> Braves 5, Astros 2  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Andy Ashby picked up his third straight win for
Atlanta and fifth in a row overall, pitching five strong innings as
the Braves defeated the Houston Astros 5-2 Friday in a game that
didn't end until shortly after 2 a.m. because of rain.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' season-high winning streak ended at five games in a
matchup of the teams that played a memorable first-round playoff
series last year.
</P>
<P>
   Originally scheduled for 7:40 p.m. EST, the first pitch was
delayed 1 hour, 46 minutes by the first storm that moved through
Turner Field. In the bottom of the fifth, the showers became so
heavy the tarp was brought out again, causing a stoppage of 1:39.
The game finally ended at 2:03 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Furcal walked to begin the fifth -- and came around to
score nearly two hours later with just a few thousand fans left in
the stands. At the beginning of the night, the stadium was packed
with a sellout crowd of 47,906.
</P>
<P>
   Wally Joyner, filling in again for the injured Andres Galarraga,
and Chipper Jones both had two RBIs. Keith Lockhart drove in
Atlanta's other run as the Braves maintained a five-game lead over
the New York Mets in the NL East.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby (7-7), who joined Max Leon and Buzz Capra as the only
Atlanta pitchers to go the distance in their first two starts with
the Braves, didn't get a chance to become the first with three in a
row.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander, acquired from Philadelphia during the All-Star
break, allowed four hits and struck out seven before the second
delay. He didn't return to the mound when play resumed.
</P>
<P>
   Four relievers finished up for the Braves, with John Rocker
struck out the side in the ninth for his 14th save.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby has won five in a row overall -- a streak that benefited
from a rainout in Florida in which he allowed six runs in three
innings. Those numbers were stricken from the record book when the
game was called.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, he is 5-0 with a 1.18 ERA in his five starts.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves had a 3-0 lead before making an out against Wade
Miller (1-3).
</P>
<P>
   Furcal led off the first with a walk, stole second and moved to
third on Andruw Jones' infield hit. Chipper Jones followed with a
double into the right-field corner, bringing home both runners.
Joyner came through with another two-bagger to the left-field
corner, scoring Jones.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Miller allowed only two hits and a walk before the
second rain delay ended his night.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby escaped trouble in the second, striking out Julio Lugo
with runners at first and third. The Astros finally broke through
in the fourth. Lance Berkman led off with a double to center, moved
to third on a wild pitch and scored on Moises Alou's sacrifice fly.
Notes: The sellout crowd pushed the Braves over 2 million in
attendance for the 10th year in a row. ... The Astros have used 19
pitchers this year, four more than all of last season and just four
short of the franchise record set in 1965. ... Braves OF George
Lombard, called up from Triple-Richmond earlier in the day, went
0-for-3. He replaced Reggie Sanders, who went on the 15-day DL with
a sore left hamstring. ... The Astros were coming off their first
sweep of the year, at Cincinnati.

<HEADLINE> Businesses Fight For GOP Attention  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER C. YATES
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Retailers will welcome the Grand Old Party
to its presidential convention with a whiff of good old-fashioned
capitalism: red, white and blue martinis, rubber elephants for the
bathtub and cookies resembling George W. Bush campaign buttons.
</P>
<P>
   The quirky promotions at retail shops, restaurants and hotels
are all about grabbing the attention -- and the cash -- of the 45,000
Republican officials, delegates and reporters who will attend the
convention, which begins Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Convention-goers can nosh on cookies decorated like the Liberty
Bell, soak in a bath with red, white and blue effervescent salts or
take home a commemorative hotel room key. At the Old City
restaurant Novelty, diners can eat ''American Pie,'' made of apples
and served with ice cream and an American flag.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Schwenderman, a spokeswoman for the Philadelphia Convention
and Visitors Bureau, said the agency asked businesses in
Philadelphia and its suburbs to get involved in the convention, as
they have with past citywide events.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's given people a way to participate, have some fun with
this,'' Schwenderman said. ''We told them: 'Do something fun and
different and you'll stand out from the crowd.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Ritz-Carlton is offering the ''unconventional bath'' package
to its guests. Each night, they'll also receive a different
convention-themed amenity, from the jelly beans favored by former
President Ronald Reagan to a white chocolate Lincoln Log pastry.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel guests, who pay from $250 to $5,000 a night for a room,
can even taste a bit of Texas by sampling Texas Governor's Mansion
Cowboy Cookies, based on a recipe by George W. Bush's wife, Laura.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel will also offer 300 magnums of imported champagne and
75 pounds of caviar.
</P>
<P>
   The Park Hyatt at the Bellevue is offering ''politically
incorrect'' martinis, including the Honest Abe, a concoction of
vodka, creme de menthe, amaretto and club soda.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Schwartz, the owner of Cookies by Design in Merion, will be
making cookies in the shape of elephants, the American flag and
political buttons touting ''Bush for President,'' among others.
</P>
<P>
   The cookies will go for $6 each, Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel du Pont in Wilmington, Del., will feature menu items
that were the favorites of past Republican presidents, including a
chocolate cake that President Gerald Ford favored and a key lime
pie that was a favorite of President Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   The convention has also given some of the city's museums a
chance to tie their collections to the festivities.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors at The Academy of Natural Sciences can learn more about
the history of elephants and how they became the GOP's symbol.
</P>
<P>
   But while tourism officials are hoping the gimmicks will be a
hit with visitors, they are also hoping residents will take
advantage of some of the fun being offered around town.
</P>
<P>
   ''People in the Philadelphia region have been hearing about this
convention for two years and the mistake would be to have the
convention come here and not be able to participate,'' Schwenderman
said.

<HEADLINE> Convention Businesses Expect Profits  </HEADLINE>
By JOANN LOVIGLIO
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Many downtown retailers and restaurateurs
have no plans to beef up security for the Republican National
Convention, saying they're looking for a week of profits, not
protesters.
</P>
<P>
   ''We usually close for vacation at this time of year, but we're
staying open because of the convention,'' Andre Ferber, president
of Jacques Ferber Furs in Philadelphia's posh Rittenhouse Square
neighborhood, said Friday. ''It's business as usual for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferber is no stranger to protests -- animal rights activists
often picket his store -- but he said he is confident the GOP
convention will be a positive event.
</P>
<P>
   ''The city's looking so alive, so beautiful,'' Ferber said. ''We
are looking forward to a great convention.''
</P>
<P>
   Such optimism is in stark contrast to the Democratic National
Convention host city of Los Angeles, where police this week showed
videotape of the violent protests during the World Trade
Organization meeting in Seattle and suggested downtown businesses
consider boarding up glass walls and windows, hiring additional
security and stocking up on emergency provisions such as
flashlights, food and water.
</P>
<P>
   In downtown Philadelphia, business owners on block after block
are festooning their storefronts with flags, red-white-and-blue
banners and elephant themes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't have a negative feeling at all. It's going to be
great,'' said Philadelphia Police Inspector Jim Tiano. ''We have
too many people on the positive side working to make this a good
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiano, who has worked with downtown business owners for a
decade, said Philadelphia police are not issuing any suggestions or
guidelines like their Los Angeles counterparts. Many retail stores
and restaurants in the path of unauthorized protests planned for
the four-day convention starting Monday said they had not made
plans to shut down or board up their businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ''This convention is a long time coming and we're ready for a
party,'' said Michelle Shannon, director of marketing for the
Center City District. ''We're working to make sure that we make the
most of this and that people who visit have a positive
experience.''

<HEADLINE> Fiji's Military Warns Rebels  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Fiji's military warned Saturday that
''stronger measures'' may be taken against rebel supporters of
arrested coup leader George Speight in a mounting crackdown aimed
at ending 10 weeks of turmoil in the South Pacific nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have given them an ultimatum,'' Lt. Ro Alipate Mataitini
said of rebels in one of a few remaining strongholds. The gunmen
have seized an island military barracks north of Suva and were
holding an unknown number of townspeople hostage.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they do not return everything and release the hostages by
Sunday midnight then we will adopt stronger measures,'' which could
include storming the barracks, Mataitini said.
</P>
<P>
   Speight and his key advisers, arrested earlier this week, were
moved Saturday from Suva's main military barracks to a small island
being used as a prison, Mataitini said.
</P>
<P>
   A new Fijian government was sworn in Friday. Although it was
strongly pro-indigenous Fijian, it included no close supporters of
Speight, whose siege -- waged in the name of ethnic Fijian rights --
unleashed a wave of civil unrest.
</P>
<P>
   Speight torpedoed the installation of an earlier government this
month by threatening violence if the Cabinet wasn't stacked with
his nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Police were investigating allegations that the coup leader
threatened the life of newly installed President Ratu Josefa
Iloilo, which the military said could lead to a charge of treason,
carrying a maximum sentence of death.
</P>
<P>
   Speight, a failed businessman, led a group of indigenous Fijians
who stormed Parliament on May 19 and held dozens of officials for
two months. The army took power 10 days after the raid and finally
met rebel demands for an amnesty, discarding the multiracial
constitution and ousting the government of Mahendra Chaudhry,
Fiji's first prime minister of Indian descent.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, the last of the hostages were released last week.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels claim that ethnic Indians -- first brought to Fiji in
the 1870s by British colonialists as indentured laborers -- have too
much power and are threatening Fijian culture. Ethnic Indians make
up 44 percent of Fiji's 814,000 population and dominate business
and commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Laisenia Qarase, a banker who promised to ''vigorously pursue''
a nationalist agenda, was sworn in as prime minister Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Qarase, who has the backing of the military, promised a
government of ''moderation, inclusion and compassion'' but said he
would strengthen indigenous Fijians' hold on power and give them a
''special place in our society.''
</P>
<P>
   Junior minister George Raj is the only ethnic Indian in the new
government.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhry's deposed government called the new administration
discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
   ''It effectively disenfranchises the Indo-Fijian community,''
said former deputy prime minister Tupeni Baba. ''It's an open
invitation for the international community to impose further
sanctions.''
</P>
<P>
   Qarase warned Chaudhry against setting up an alternative
government within Fiji, saying that persisting with a plan to do so
would ''be dealt with according to law.''
</P>
<P>
   Australia, New Zealand and the United States have imposed
sanctions on Fiji, demanding it quickly restore democracy.

<HEADLINE> Transsexual Fights For Estate Share  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID MILES
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEAVENWORTH, Kan. (AP) -- After Marshall Gardiner died last year,
one of his friends suggested there might be more to his widow than
meets the eye.
</P>
<P>
   So Gardiner's only son, Joe, hired a private investigator and
found out that his stepmother, J'Noel Gardiner, was once a man.
</P>
<P>
   The two are now embroiled in a legal battle over the late
Gardiner's $2.5 million estate in a case that could have
wide-ranging ramifications on the recognition of transsexuals and
their unions across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's so little case law in marriages involving a
transsexual person that inevitably, other states are going to look
at what Kansas does,'' said Shannon Minter, a lawyer for the
National Center for Lesbian Rights in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Gardiner did not leave a will. In such a case, under
Kansas law, the estate typically would be divided evenly between a
spouse and an only child.
</P>
<P>
   But Joe Gardiner went to court a week after his 86-year-old
father's death last August, contending he was the sole beneficiary
because J'Noel signed a document waiving her rights to an
inheritance. At the time, he didn't know that J'Noel once was a
man.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Leavenworth County District Judge Gunnar Sundby
ruled that Marshall's marriage to J'Noel was void and thus J'Noel
had no rights to the estate. The judge cited a Kansas law that only
permits opposite-sex couples to marry.
</P>
<P>
   Though the judge ruled that J'Noel was still a male, the state
of Wisconsin had issued a new birth certificate saying she was a
female.
</P>
<P>
   Sundby did not rule on the inheritance waiver, saying he needed
more information on the document and the circumstances of how it
was written.
</P>
<P>
   J'Noel has petitioned the state Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel that she is clearly a woman and that the law in
Wisconsin and the court order in Wisconsin should be recognized in
Kansas,'' said Sandy Krigel, J'Noel's attorney.
</P>
<P>
   J'Noel, 42, declined to be interviewed for this story.
</P>
<P>
   In the past five years, Minter, of the lesbian rights group,
said he has seen an increase in legal cases related to marriages
involving transsexuals and expects the trend to continue as their
numbers grow.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the half-dozen or so such cases across the
country in the past year have resulted in decisions upholding the
validity of those marriages, said Minter, who had a sex change
operation to become a man.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Gardiner served in the state House of Representatives
from 1957 to 1960, then worked as a stock broker and amassed his
fortune from his own investments. Friends and relatives describe
him as an eccentric recluse.
</P>
<P>
   His first wife died in 1984. He was 85 when he met J'Noel, then
40, in May 1998 at Park University in Parkville, Mo., where J'Noel
teaches finance. They married four months later.
</P>
<P>
   Joe, 52, said he didn't learn of any romantic involvement
between the two until his father called him two days after the
wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Gardiner died of an apparent heart attack in
August 1999, the younger Gardiner learned from a private
investigator that J'Noel was once a man named Jay Ball who had sex
change operations in 1994 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''This happens in movies; this doesn't happen in real life,''
Joe said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   During a deposition, J'Noel said she told Marshall Gardiner
before they married about the operations. Joe said he doesn't
believe his father would have married her if he knew about the sex
change.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was very old-fashioned in his moralistic views,'' said Joe,
who moved to Leavenworth from Cleveland, Ga., in December to pursue
the estate case.
</P>
<P>
   J'Noel has said Marshall Gardiner never wanted his son to have
the money.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome of the litigation, it and similar cases are
likely to challenge traditional notions of gender and marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are going to love across boundaries, and that needs to
be reflected and respected in the law,'' said Riki Wilchins,
executive director of the New York-based advocacy group GenderPAC.

<HEADLINE> FDA Advisers Seek Anthrax Drug OK  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL RECER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- In a step toward preparing the nation for
a possible biological terrorist attack, an advisory committee is
recommending approval of an antibiotic for people who have been
exposed to inhaled anthrax bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   If approved for this use, the antibiotic ciprofloxacin would be
the first line of defense for a biological attack on civilians by
aerosol-spread anthrax spores, a theoretical threat that the
government takes quite seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Ciprofloxacin has been marketed for 13 years by Bayer Corp. of
West Haven, Conn., under the brand name Cipro. The drug already is
approved for a wide variety of infections and has been used by
about 250 million patients worldwide. But there is no drug formally
approved for preventing infection in people exposed to inhaled
anthrax.
</P>
<P>
   Committee chairman Dr. L. Barth Reller of Duke University said
the unanimous vote of the committee ''is clearly linked'' to the
unusual circumstances of preparing for a possible terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
   FDA approval is considered by insiders as almost certain. The
FDA had requested that Bayer apply for the formal approval and some
federal agencies had already recommended Cipro as the prophylactic
drug of choice for people exposed to inhaled anthrax.
</P>
<P>
   To be effective, experts said, Cipro would have to be taken by
exposed patients before symptoms appear. Once the fever, chills,
rash and respiratory congestion start, there is little that can be
done, researchers said. This means that once it is known there has
been a release of anthrax spores, people will, within hours, have
to take an antibiotic, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
   A presidential directive two years ago called on federal
agencies to coordinate efforts to protect against biological
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Cipro already has been identified by the Army and by the Centers
for Disease Prevention and Control as the recommended antibiotic
for post-exposure treatment of inhaled anthrax. The military
stockpiled the drug during the Persian Gulf War, where there was a
threat of biological weapons use.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC also is poised to stockpile the drug.
</P>
<P>
   The military launched a program to vaccinate all of its
personnel against anthrax, but a shortage of the vaccine has slowed
the effort. A Michigan plant that was making the vaccine has been
closed and will require FDA approval before it can reopen.
</P>
<P>
   When inhaled, anthrax rapidly produces toxins that cause severe
damage to the respiratory system and brain. Untreated patients
usually die within days.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also reviewed data from monkey studies that showed
Cipro and some other antibiotics could prevent infection from
developing after inhaled anthrax exposure. The data, from an Army
study, however, showed that inhaled anthrax spores in the lungs can
remain dangerous and infectious for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed indication for Cipro calls for adults to take 500
milligrams every 12 hours for 60 days after a possible exposure to
inhaled anthrax. Children would take smaller doses for the same
period.
</P>
<P>
   Anthrax bacteria has been manufactured as a biological weapon by
at least three nations, Russia, Iraq and Iran. At least 14 other
nations, according to a federal study, have biological weapons
programs, but it is not known how many are using anthrax.
</P>
<P>
   The deadliness of a spray of anthrax spores has been widely
recognized. A Congressional study concluded spraying just 200
pounds of anthrax spore over Washington, D.C., could killed up to 3
million people.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, workers at an anthrax plant in Sverdlovsk, Russia,
operated a spore drying machine without replacing a filter. This
allowed spores of the bacteria to drift downwind. About 400 people,
some up to three miles away were sickened and about 90 died before
effective treatment could be started. A flock of sheep 30 miles
away was killed by the disease.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Parodies Bush's Background  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Egged on by an appreciative audience of Democrats,
including a large complement of Kennedys, President Clinton mocked
GOP presidential candidate George W. Bush's privileged background
and the political tactics of congressional Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   He summed up the Bush campaign message this way: '''How bad
could I be? I've been governor of Texas, my daddy was president, I
own a baseball team, they like me down there, everything is rocking
along hunky-dory.'''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of about 450 political supporters of Rhode Island
Democratic Rep. Patrick Kennedy chortled as Clinton continued to
parody Bush.
</P>
<P>
   '''Their fraternity had it for eight years, give it to ours for
eight years because we're compassionate and humane,''' Clinton
said. '''We're not like what you think about us from watching the
Congress for the last five years.'''
</P>
<P>
   In his weekly radio address, Clinton also chastised
congressional Republicans for failing to act on his proposal to
raise the minimum wage by $1, to $6.15 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ''As recently as last week, the majority in Congress was still
talking about raising the minimum wage but they couldn't bring
themselves to actually do it,'' Clinton said, noting that Congress
is now taking a summer recess.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the last hours before their recess, they were still working
overtime to give tax breaks to the tiniest, wealthiest fraction of
America's families and still doing nothing for the 10 million
people who would benefit from a boost in the minimum wage,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans back an increase in the minimum wage, although
legislation to do it has been bottled up in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The increase could affect about 10 million people who are at or
just above minimum wage, the White House said. The $1 raise would
increase the annual earnings of a full-time worker by $2,000
annually, the White House estimated.
</P>
<P>
   At the close of his radio address, Clinton noted that
Republicans gather this weekend for their presidential nominating
convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope they'll stop a moment to think of Americans outside
that hall -- Americans working in the restaurants, the shops, the
hotels of Philadelphia, working hard for the minimum wage,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Kennedy clambake, Clinton said there is no need for
negative campaigning, but clearly relished the opportunity to throw
some sharp, partisan elbows.
</P>
<P>
   He accused the GOP of trying to ''blur, blur, blur'' its record,
which Clinton calls extreme.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, he said, hope that voters satisfied with the rosy
economy will tune out the differences between Bush and Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are saying, ... you couldn't mess up this economy with
a stick of dynamite, there doesn't seem to be much difference to
me,'' Clinton said at the Kennedy clambake. ''Nearest I can tell,
the message of the Bush campaign is just that: ''That's the
message, isn't it? Blur, blur, blur. Blur all the distinctions,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Still in a wisecracking mood at a later fund-raising party to
benefit Democratic congressional candidates, Clinton said
congressional Republicans are slicing their tax cut package into
small pieces and passing them one by one to disguise the package's
true size.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're doing this in salami tactics, so you won't notice,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House claims that Republican tax proposals could
consume upward of $2 trillion over time, and would devour all of
the projected budget surplus. Clinton wants to use the money to
safeguard Social Security and Medicare, among other things.

<HEADLINE> Meningitis Case At Disneyland Paris  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Authorities urged people who went to a discotheque
at Disneyland Paris to consult a doctor after a young man who
visited the nightclub last weekend was hospitalized with
meningitis, police said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in the Seine-la-Marne district said the 24-year-old
man, who visited the theme park's ''Hurricane'' nightclub the night
of July 22, was diagnosed with a ''severe form'' of meningitis.
</P>
<P>
   Police have recommended that everyone who was at the nightclub
last weekend seek preventive medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Disneyland Paris could not be immediately reached
for comment. Symptoms of meningitis include severe headaches and
vomiting.
</P>
<P>
   Bacterial meningitis is a serious and often deadly infection of
fluid and membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. It is
spread through coughing, kissing and other close contact.

<HEADLINE> Kashmiri Welcomes India's Offer  </HEADLINE>
By ASHOK SHARMA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SRINAGAR, India (AP) -- Kashmir's top separatist leader on
Saturday welcomed New Delhi's offer of unconditional talks and
proposed simultaneous discussions with India and Pakistan to solve
the Himalayan region's tangled five-decade dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ''The proposal reflects a change and could be a step in the
right direction,'' said Abdul Ghani Bhat, the new chairman of an
umbrella group of organizations seeking predominantly Muslim
Kashmir's independence from India. ''It will certainly help resolve
the Kashmir dispute.''
</P>
<P>
   Bhat said he had held unofficial discussions with some Indian
officials. That confirmed reports that backdoor meetings have been
taking place to end the 11-year-old insurgency in the Himalayan
region.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our proposal is that four of our representatives can talk to
New Delhi and three to Pakistan simultaneously,'' Bhat said.
</P>
<P>
   A 1972 cease-fire line divides the mountainous province of
Kashmir between India and Pakistan, hostile neighbors who have
fought three wars in the past five decades. India controls
two-thirds of Kashmir, Pakistan the rest, and both sides claim the
entire territory. Some separatist groups want to carve out an
independent state; others want Kashmir to become part of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   India's Interior Ministry late Friday invited all militant
groups and political leaders in Kashmir to hold discussions with
the government, newspaper reports said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The statement has not referred to any conditions, and if this
is true this is the first time the Indians are making such a
proposal,'' Bhat said in an earlier telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian offer of talks follows a unilateral three-month
cease-fire declared July 24 by the Pakistan-based Hezb-ul
Mujahedeen, which carries out guerrilla operations in Kashmir. At
the time, Hezb-ul Mujahedeen chief Syed Salauddin said his group
was ready for talks with India. Hezb-ul Mujahedeen is not part of
the separatist umbrella group.
</P>
<P>
   Other guerrilla groups have vowed to fight on for independence.
Clashes between the guerrillas and security forces in
Indian-controlled Kashmir have left more than 16,000 people dead
since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there were conflicting statements from senior Indian
army officers about whether military operations against Islamic
guerrillas had been halted in response to the cease-fire declared
by Hezb-ul Mujahedeen.
</P>
<P>
   Army spokesman Col. Shruti Kant said in New Delhi there had been
no change in military operations in Kashmir. He did not comment on
a statement made to The Associated Press, the United News of India
and the Press Trust of India on Friday by the top general in
Kashmir, Maj. Gen. Basant Singh, who said all offensive operations
against militants had stopped on July 25.

<HEADLINE> Penn. Gov. Previews GOP Convention  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans will see a ''different kind of
Republican convention'' at the upcoming Philadelphia bash, said
Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Featured speakers ''will display a positive unifying vision of
America,'' Ridge said in the weekly Republican radio address.
''What you won't hear in Philadelphia is the politics of division
and personal destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Republican luminaries, including Colin Powell, Gen.
Norman Schwarzkopf, Sen. John McCain, Elizabeth Dole, as well as
the GOP ticket of Gov. George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, are
scheduled to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge predicted that the Bush-Cheney ticket will carry the
Northeast, normally Democratic territory, saying, ''Republicans are
conceding no region, no issue and no voter.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor, once on the short list of Bush's potential vice
presidential choices, highlighted Bush's record in his home state
of Texas and how Bush gathered multiracial support to win a
landslide re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge said next week's event will also show hardworking
Americans, in order to derail any attempt by Vice President Al Gore
to take credit for the current healthy economic state.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people of America are more responsible for American
greatness than elected officials,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Another Tiger Dies in Indian Zoo  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Another white tiger has died at a zoo in
eastern India where 12 others have died in the past month,
officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, the tiger -- which had been recovering from
antibiotic treatment -- died at the Nandankanan Zoo in Bhubaneshwar,
United News of India news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Results of the necropsy were expected this week and could help
officials determine the cause of the deaths, which some officials
blamed on rotten meat.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo officials, however, said the animals were killed by
Trypanosomiasis, a bacterial disease carried by flies. The tigers,
including the one that died Friday, were being treated for the
disease with antibiotics, zoo officials said.
</P>
<P>
   India's Supreme Court has ordered a federal investigation into
the deaths of the tigers.
</P>
<P>
   The zoo, home to India's largest collection of tigers, now has
18 white tigers.

<HEADLINE> Allegations Hit European Casino  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- Police raided the homes of employees of
Europe's largest casino, uncovering up to $461,000 in an alleged
lending scheme, reports said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 10 workers from Casino Estoril face charges of usury
and extortion, the weekly Expresso said. Police also found jewels
in the raid Wednesday, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Police also searched the homes of seven of the casino's regular
gamblers as part of a three-year investigation. More than 40
gamblers also were banned from entering the Lisbon-area casino,
which is owned by Macau magnate Stanley Ho, Expresso said.

<HEADLINE> Time Running Out For Congress' Work  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress has just 23 scheduled work days left
in a year marked by modest achievement but plenty of political
positioning.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the goals that President Clinton and the
Republican-led Congress proclaimed at the beginning of 2000 remain
unfulfilled. They are divided over new prescription drug benefits
for Medicare recipients, expanded rights for managed care patients,
broad tax cuts, major improvements for schools and a sweeping
overhaul of campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   Deals unattainable in the first seven months of the year seem
unlikely to jell in September. With the calendar short, the issues
complex and the White House, House and Senate all up for grabs,
both parties have compelling reasons to draw contrasts and deny
each other achievements to boast about.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone has an interest in making themselves look like the
good guy and the other guy look like the bad guy,'' Gary Copeland,
a University of Oklahoma political scientist who studies Congress,
said Friday after lawmakers adjourned until Sept. 5.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1996 presidential campaign, Clinton and Congress
shook hands on a revamped welfare system, expanded health care
access for millions of people, a minimum wage increase and new
clean water laws.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Republicans were busily rehabilitating their image
just months after two government shutdowns, and Clinton wanted some
bragging points for his own re-election. While many Republicans
still want to be seen as pragmatic, capable of getting things done,
and Clinton would like some accomplishments for his legacy, the
dynamic for cooperation is weaker now.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, both sides have spent much energy this year
spotlighting their differences.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has sent Clinton one bill cutting taxes for millions of
married couples and is ready to send him another eliminating the
federal estate tax, knowing he will veto both. Democrats have
pushed relentlessly for gun control, prescription drug benefits and
campaign finance laws, aware a deal is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ''They seem to have a lot of wedge issues they are using to
attempt to defeat incumbents in the other party,'' said James
Thurber, an American University political scientist.
</P>
<P>
   On some popular issues, each party has tried muffling partisan
differences by offering milder versions of the other side's
priorities. Republicans have pushed through the House a more modest
package of drug benefits than Clinton wants, while Democrats
offered a version of marriage tax relief that was smaller and more
limited than the GOP's plan.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, Clinton and Congress have enacted laws cutting
taxes on many working Social Security recipients, making electronic
signatures legally binding and forcing some secretive political
groups to report campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   They are also likely to use most of this year's projected $232
billion budget surplus to reduce the national debt, though that is
due more to political gridlock over how to use that money than to a
preference for debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
   Agreement seems likely on several other fronts. These include
establishing permanent, normal trade relations with China;
eliminating the 3 percent federal tax on telephone service; a
bipartisan drive for tax breaks and other help for economically
struggling neighborhoods; and perhaps raising the $5.15 hourly
minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   But neither party has made a serious effort to reinforce Social
Security or Medicare for the approaching retirement of the 76
million-strong baby boom generation. With few politicians ready to
endorse tax increases or benefit cuts that such an effort would
likely entail, most have spent the year endorsing cosmetic
approaches that include using both programs' trust funds for debt
reduction.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the remaining 23 days will be consumed as Congress and
Clinton wrangle over their must-pass spending business.
</P>
<P>
   Just one of the 13 annual spending bills for the coming fiscal
year has been signed. A second, a $288 billion defense package, is
heading to Clinton for his likely approval. Once done, that will
leave 11 packages to be completed, totaling almost $600 billion, or
one-third of the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   These bills face bitter battles over money for hiring teachers,
repairing schools and purchasing land for parks, as well as
provisions blocking White House efforts to sue the tobacco industry
and help abortion-rights efforts overseas. As a result, eight face
administration veto threats, underlining how both sides are using
the spending fight to highlight differences.

<HEADLINE> N. Korean Isolation Is Melting  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW PENNINGTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Having witnessed North Korea's debut
this week at Asia's largest security forum, officials from world
powers said they were optimistic Saturday about the communist
nation's coming in from the cold after five decades of
international isolation.
</P>
<P>
   This week's Association of Southeast Asian Nations Regional
Forum in Bangkok gave policymakers from 23 countries a chance to
air security concerns ranging from internal strife to missile
threats. But the highlight was the participation of North Korea, a
reclusive state whose belligerence and ballistic missile capability
have cast a dark shadow across the region.
</P>
<P>
   ''Countries which used to have frosty relations with North Korea
have come together and broken the icy curtain between them,'' Thai
Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan told a news conference closing the
forum. ''Many possibilities and potentials are now open.''
</P>
<P>
   North Korean Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun, who departed
Saturday, was feted by his counterparts here. Among the swirl of
swift bilateral talks, he secured agreements to normalize relations
with Canada and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a half-century of hostilities with the United States
was eased a little by a longer-than-expected meeting between the
North Koreans and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. She said
the talks were short on substance -- particularly about North
Korea's plans for its missile program -- but historically
significant.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think North Korea being part of the system is important in
bringing it out of its isolation,'' Albright told reporters
Saturday before leaving Thailand for Japan. She returns to
Washington on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Also at the conference, Indonesia drew a favorable response to
its appeal for money and humanitarian assistance to ease tensions
in the Maluku islands. The islands have been riven by violence
between Muslims and Christians, leaving about 4,000 people dead
over the past 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Albright met Indonesian Foreign Minister Alwi Shihab on Saturday
and said he ''talked about the importance of trying to get some of
the troublemakers out of there.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We said we'd look at how the international community could be
of assistance,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan underlined
opposition to missile defense systems planned by the United States.
The systems risk sparking an arms race and would seriously
compromise regional security and stability, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The issue is by no means a dispute between China and the
United States only, but rather it is a dispute between the United
States and the rest of the world,'' Tang said. Similar objections
had also been raised by Russia and Vietnam earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   The United States says the two planned shields -- one to defend
U.S. territory and another to protect U.S. troops in South Korea
and Japan -- are not aimed at China and Russia but at stopping
missiles from smaller states hostile to U.S. interests.
Nonetheless, the idea has been widely criticized by U.S. allies and
adversaries who call it a threat to stability and arms control
treaties.
</P>
<P>
   China fears the shield over Japan and Korea could be extended
over Taiwan, which Beijing views as a renegade province. U.S.
pledges to protect Taiwan are seen as by China as interference in
Chinese internal affairs.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Library in Hot Water  </HEADLINE>
By KELLY P. KISSEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Even before the first shovelful of
earth is turned, the planned Bill Clinton Presidential Library has
become entangled in a dispute that threatens to embarrass city
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   There's little chance the $80 million-plus library won't be
built, but the Arkansas Supreme Court is considering a taxpayer's
lawsuit claiming the city illegally tapped tax accounts to buy the
land for the project. There's no word on when a ruling might come
from the court, which is on its annual summer recess until
September.
</P>
<P>
   It's just one more dig at the president by his opponents, said
Clinton's library project leader, Skip Rutherford.
</P>
<P>
   ''They think, 'I can't vote against him any more, but I sure can
mess with his library,''' Rutherford said.
</P>
<P>
   Although some people criticized any effort to honor the
impeached president, the city wanted the library so badly that it
agreed to buy a 27-acre site for $8.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Voters weren't asked. Other cities were vying for the library,
and Rutherford said there wasn't time for an election.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had offers in state and out of state that were ready to
go,'' Rutherford said. ''We didn't care what fund it was coming out
of, we just didn't want a contingent offer.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute arose because Little Rock dedicated park revenues --
including fees from the zoo and golf courses -- to pay off bonds to
fund the library land purchase.
</P>
<P>
   However, those revenues often are supplemented by city general
fund revenues to pay for park operations. And part of the general
fund comes from taxes, which can't be used to pay off bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The city made a $470,000 bond payment at the beginning of July.
It used only parks revenue but city leaders said they would likely
have to tap the general fund later for park operations.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed by Nora Harris, a resident who has sued
the city on other tax issues and who calls the land purchase
arrangement a shell game.
</P>
<P>
   ''They can't look at anyone and say they're not using tax money
to pay off the bonds,'' said her lawyer, David Henry.
</P>
<P>
   A local judge upheld the city's payment arrangement, and Harris
appealed directly to the state's highest court.
</P>
<P>
   Harris supporters include Miles King, a real estate developer,
who said he would have liked to see the land acquired differently.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not opposed to the library and its concept. It's the
method by which they went about trying to pull off the deal to get
it financed that I'm opposed to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Construction will be funded by donations. Rutherford said the
project will cost $80 million to $125 million.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how the Arkansas Supreme Court rules, the city intends
to keep its commitment on the land but will have to find another
way to pay off the bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The library site is in the city's booming River Market district,
overlooking the Arkansas River downtown. Long-mothballed warehouses
have been turned into bars, restaurants, shops and apartments. An
amphitheater presents concerts.
</P>
<P>
   Even without a construction timetable, the Clinton Library
already has influenced other development in the area. Acxiom Corp.,
a Conway-based data warehousing company, plans a $25 million,
12-story building there.
</P>
<P>
   ''Knowing that the library was going to be here was a key factor
in our decision because it demonstrated to us that there would be
continued development in this area,'' Acxiom chairman Charles
Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   The library would include a museum, a repository for Clinton's
official records and classrooms. An academic wing would offer
public policy degrees with the University of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   ''Scholars will travel to Little Rock whether they like Clinton
or don't like Clinton and they will stay in the city's hotels,''
said Roger Hartley, an associate professor of public affairs at
Roanoke College in Salem, Va. ''This presidency has had a lot of
attention -- not all of it good attention -- which should attract
more people to study.''	   Among other presidential libraries, the Nixon Library
in Yorba
Linda, Calif., had 144,500 visitors in 1998, and the Johnson
Library near Austin, Texas, attracted 240,000 that year.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, Hartley said, Little Rock will be happy to turn
an old riverside warehouse district into a political attraction.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be built somewhere,'' he said. ''Why not Little
Rock?''

<HEADLINE> Kashmir Groups Accept India's Offer  </HEADLINE>
By ASHOK SHARMA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SRINAGAR, India (AP) -- Kashmir's top umbrella group of political
and separatist organizations on Saturday accepted India's offer of
unconditional peace talks, proposing simultaneous discussions with
India and Pakistan to solve the Himalayan region's tangled
five-decade dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ''The proposal reflects a change and could be a step in the
right direction,'' said Abdul Ghani Bhat, the new chairman of the
All Party Hurriyat Conference, which represents 32 political
parties and former rebel groups in Kashmir. ''It will certainly
help resolve the Kashmir dispute.''
</P>
<P>
   Bhat, whose organization seeks predominantly Muslim Kashmir's
independence from India, said he had held unofficial discussions
with some Indian officials. That confirmed reports that backdoor
meetings have been taking place to end the 11-year-old insurgency
in the Himalayan region.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our proposal is that four of our representatives can talk to
New Delhi and three to Pakistan simultaneously,'' Bhat said.
</P>
<P>
   His comments came among quick diplomatic developments in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   India's top military commander in Kashmir, Lt. Gen. J.R.
Mukherjee, said Saturday that he had instructed his officers to
suspend all operations against the pro-Pakistan Hezb-ul Mujahedeen
guerrilla group. On Tuesday, the Hezb-ul Mujahedeen announced a
unilateral cease-fire and said it would be willing to talk to
India's government after fighting Indian forces for more than a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Not all Pakistan-based guerrilla groups have agreed to stop
fighting, though. Some have vowed to continue opposing the Indian
forces in Kashmir, and an alliance of militant groups has
criticized the Hezb-ul Mujahedeen for its cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our operations against other tanzeems (militant groups) will
continue,'' Gen. Mukherjee told reporters in Srinagar, summer
capital of Kashmir and the center of Islamic insurgency since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   He said there are nearly 1,500 militants fighting in the region.
Up to 850 belong to the Hezb-ul Mujahedeen and the rest represent
nearly a dozen other militant organizations.
</P>
<P>
   A 1972 cease-fire line divides the mountainous Kashmir province
between India and Pakistan, hostile neighbors who have fought three
wars in the five decades since British colonialism ended. India
controls two-thirds of Kashmir, Pakistan the rest, and both sides
claim the entire territory.
</P>
<P>
   Some separatist groups here want to carve out an independent
state; others want Kashmir to become part of Pakistan. Daily
battles between the guerrillas and security forces in
Indian-controlled Kashmir have left more than 16,000 people dead
since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict has been a regular source of friction between India
and Pakistan. Now both countries have developed nuclear weapons,
making the prospects of another war particularly worrisome.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, India's Interior Ministry invited all militant groups
and political leaders in Kashmir to hold discussions with the
government. ''The statement has not referred to any conditions, and
if this is true this is the first time the Indians are making such
a proposal,'' Bhat said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the cease-fire announced by the Hezb-ul Mujahedeen and
the positive Indian reaction were prodded by interest from the West
and China.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a Group of Eight resolution urged India and Pakistan
to resume talks over Kashmir. President Clinton also encouraged
resumption of the dialogue when he visited India and Pakistan in
February.
</P>
<P>
   ''The recent visit of the Chinese foreign minister to India and
Pakistan preceded the declaration of the three-month cease-fire by
the key militant group,'' Bhat said.

<HEADLINE> Disposable Hearing Aid Hits Market  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID PITT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Thanks to too much cranked up Led Zeppelin and
Lynyrd Skynyrd, thousands of aging baby boomers are suffering
hearing loss.
</P>
<P>
   But the old-fashioned, conspicuous hearing aids are not an
option for many boomers reluctant to admit they need one and
worried about looking old. And most smaller, in-the-ear canal
devices may be too expensive for those with only mild hearing loss.
</P>
<P>
   So one company thinks it has an answer: a hearing aid that is
inexpensive enough over the short term that it can be disposable.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I saw this type of hearing aid, I thought it would give
me the chance to try them out in both ears and have an in-the-ear
hearing aid to see if I liked it,'' said Dave Trent of Atlanta, 42.
</P>
<P>
   In-the-ear digital hearing aids can cost close to $5,000 for
both ears and occasionally need new batteries. The Songbird hearing
aid, which became available earlier this year, can be replaced when
it wears out in 30 to 40 days at a cost of about $80.
</P>
<P>
   Songbird is manufactured by Songbird Hearing Inc. of Cranbury,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   To overcome the perception that hearing aids are only for the
elderly, Songbird CEO Fred Fritz said the product will be marketed
to address noise-induced -- as opposed to age-related -- hearing
loss, the most common reason for baby boomer hearing difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   A 1991 government study said the number of men aged 45 to 65
suffering hearing problems was 36 percent higher than in a similar
study in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ''Songbird is targeted to the vast population of baby boomers
whose lifelong exposure to decibel-blasting music, high-pitched
manufacturing noises and other forms of noise pollution has taken
its toll on their hearing,'' said Helena Solodar, co-owner of
Audiological Consultants of Atlanta, which sells the hearing aid.
</P>
<P>
   To some in the industry, Songbird's innovation is more marketing
than science.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is an interesting concept, but the circuitry is not that
revolutionary,'' said Doug Hudson, CEO of HearingPlanet.Com, an
Internet seller of hearing aid products based in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Powers, director of audiology for Siemens Hearing
Instruments, a New Jersey-based maker and seller, said one concern
is that users of disposable hearing aids might not get checkups as
often because they don't require maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's really no mechanism or guarantee that a person would
get future hearing tests to see if their hearing has changed,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are lots of professionals that are not real excited
about this product,'' Hudson said.
</P>
<P>
   Solodar said Songbirds cannot be dispensed without a hearing
test or consultation with an audiologist.
</P>
<P>
   And although the Songbird is cheaper initially than other
hearing aids, in the long run it can be more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The newest digital hearing aids cost around $4,600 for both
ears, but they'll last five or six years. The cost of Songbirds,
replaced monthly, would be about $5,760 for six years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hudson predicts Songbird will sell well.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a good idea for the consumer who is not sure they want to
commit to full-fledged program of amplification and hearing
rehabilitation,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Thousands Mourn Concorde Victims  </HEADLINE>
By HANS GREIMEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOENCHENGLADBACH, Germany (AP) -- The names echoing off the
church's cold stone walls pushed many over the edge.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 2,000 mourners in this western German city that was home
to 13 of the 114 victims in Tuesday's Concorde crash packed the
main Lutheran church Saturday to remember the dead and confront the
questions haunting them: ''Why this plane?'' asked Mayor Monika
Bartsch. ''Why these people?''
</P>
<P>
   As the pastor solemnly read the names of the six couples and one
child who went down in flames, relatives began weeping and
clutching each other. The hundreds of townspeople crammed into the
church sniffled into handkerchiefs and looked on with grim faces.
</P>
<P>
   ''This plane crash was different,'' Bartsch told the mourners.
''This time it was our friends, our families, our loved ones.''
</P>
<P>
   The carnage of the crash outside Paris shook staid and stoic
Germany, a country that typically shies away from open displays of
national emotion. This neatly appointed residential city of 270,000
in Germany's industrial heartland has become the unlikely focal
point for national grief.
</P>
<P>
   The trip started out as a dream vacation for the six local
couples -- a flight on the Concorde from Paris to New York, where
they would rendezvous with other friends and acquaintances for a
Caribbean cruise. Their memories triggered an outpouring of emotion
during Saturday's service, held just across the town square from
the travel agency that booked their tickets.
</P>
<P>
   With mourners standing four deep in the back and side aisles,
nearly 50 relatives were escorted down the center row to take
reserved seats up front before an altar adorned with ivory Easter
lilies. Church bells pealed. The city's firefighters and police
officers, clad in formal, button-down dress uniforms, stood as
honor guards at the church's entrances.
</P>
<P>
   In a show of solidarity, about 1,700 townspeople attended the
service, their black clothes turning the city square into an
obsidian sea as they emptied from the church. The city canceled its
lively Saturday street market to accommodate the attendees.
</P>
<P>
   The hourlong service of hymns and prayers ended with the
heart-rending ceremony that broke the mourners' composure: As each
victim's name was read aloud, an attendant came forward to gently
pour water from a glass chalice into a common urn. Fourteen times
the attendant poured -- one chalice-full for each of
Moenchengladbach's lost citizens, and one for all the others.

<HEADLINE> Chavez Likely To Win Vote  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN GUTKIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Life for most Venezuelans has become
much harder since Hugo Chavez assumed the presidency 18 months ago
promising a ''social revolution'' for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   But a deeply troubled economy and a surge in crime and
unemployment do not appear to be dampening Chavez's chances of
being re-elected in Sunday's balloting: Polls give him a 20-point
lead over his nearest challenger.
</P>
<P>
   The charismatic president -- who took power through elections six
years after failing to do so through a military coup -- says
Sunday's vote is the last step in his reshuffling of the state that
has already seen the dissolution of the old Congress and Supreme
Court and the enactment of a new constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Most Venezuelans seem to believe Chavez when he says the
revolution's next phase will be about what matters most to them:
jobs, money and personal safety.
</P>
<P>
   ''After the elections, the political confrontation will be left
behind,'' Chavez vowed in a speech before thousands of cheering
supporters Wednesday night. ''We will devote our hearts to the
social and economic recovery of Venezuela.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet during that same speech, Chavez called his opponents
''oligarchs, traitors and counterrevolutionaries.'' His critics
blame that kind of combative rhetoric for the economic downturn,
saying he scares away investors.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's ability to connect with the masses has overwhelmed his
main challenger, former Zulia state Gov. Francisco Arias Cardenas,
who helped Chavez stage his famous 1992 coup attempt but broke away
from the president this year.
</P>
<P>
   Arias, who wants to reverse what he calls Chavez's
militarization of Venezuela, has drawn huge support from the upper
and middle classes, and has been unable to shake an image as the
candidate of the rich.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's long, serpentine speeches -- often the butt of jokes
among the elite -- play well in the slums and shantytowns that are
home to the majority of the South American nation's 23 million
people.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like to hear his speeches because they reach you. He tells
the people the truth,'' said Jose Escalora, 42.
</P>
<P>
   To Chavez's detractors, there can be no excuse for last year's 7
percent economic contraction and this year's disappointing 0.3
percent growth from January to March.
</P>
<P>
   They point out that Venezuela, the world's third-largest
petroleum exporter, is in the middle of an oil boom with prices at
their highest level in years. They also say Chavez, by virtually
eliminating Venezuela's old political order and ''handpicking'' his
own officials, has had unparalleled power to direct the economy in
any way he chooses.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the new constitution's requirement for
''re-legitimizing'' public offices, Venezuelans on Sunday will
elect a president, congressman, governors and mayors.
</P>
<P>
   They were supposed to have voted on May 28, but that election
was postponed because of technical difficulties in the
vote-tallying system. The delay was an embarrassment for Chavez's
ruling coalition, which had hand-picked the electoral council.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the public's well-being has suffered from the
political chaos, and Sunday's vote will be Venezuela's sixth in a
year and a half.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's fine to have a series of elections and to have a new
constitution. But that's not what people really demand,'' said
Michael Shifter, a Latin America specialist at the Washington-based
Inter-American Dialogue. ''They want greater security. They want
better economic conditions. And on those crucial issues Venezuela
really seems to be going in the wrong direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Chavez's revolutionary rhetoric, the truth is that not
much has changed on the economic front since he took office. The
insular nature of Venezuela's oil wealth has allowed governments to
avoid structural reform for decades. And like Chavez, most previous
Venezuelan presidents preferred statist economic management to
free-market policies.
</P>
<P>
   Some wonder if Chavez's shake-up really amounts to a
''revolution,'' or if it's just exchanging one group of elites for
another.
</P>
<P>
   And as Sunday's vote approaches, it's becoming clear Chavez may
not have erased Venezuela's traditional ruling class as thoroughly
as he had hoped. Polls show his leftist Patriotic Pole coalition
stands to lose as many as half of Venezuela's gubernatorial races,
with candidates from traditional parties enjoying far better name
recognition than Chavez's ''revolutionary'' candidates.
</P>
<P>
   And while the president's movement will likely win a majority in
a new, 165-member unicameral legislature, it will probably fall
short of the two-thirds majority needed to rubber stamp
presidential appointments and proposed laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without a doubt the opposition is going to be very much
stronger than what's it been until now,'' Caracas pollster Luis
Vicente Leon said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Weapons Inspector Back in Iraq  </HEADLINE>
By WAIEL FALEH
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- When Scott Ritter showed up at Iraqi
weapons depots in the years after the Gulf War, international
crises would brew. Now the former U.N. weapons inspector is back --
with a documentary film crew and the government's blessing.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter wants to see the sites again, and he could find doors
opening far more easily since his shift from ardent defender of
intrusive weapons inspections to advocate of lifting sanctions from
a nation he says is no longer a threat.
</P>
<P>
   His documentary is ''an attempt to educate the American people
and also the people of Europe about the reality of the situation
regarding the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq,'' Ritter told
Iraqi reporters Saturday at the Rashid Hotel in Baghdad, where he
is staying.
</P>
<P>
   He said he seeks ''a solution on lifting the sanctions off Iraq
and alleviating the suffering of 22 million innocent people who are
stuck in the middle of a fight between the Security Council on one
hand and the Iraqi government on the other hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Though his visit would have required approval at the highest
levels, Ritter acknowledged uncertainty as to the access he would
have to weapons sites. The Iraqi government has not said where he
would be allowed to go or with whom he could meet.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope to gain access to a number of locations in Iraq that I
was very familiar with as a weapons inspector,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter's trip, which began Friday with his secret arrival, is an
unusual twist in the long Iraqi sanctions saga.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations leveled economic sanctions against Iraq after
its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, and those sanctions are still in place
today. Only after a U.N. inspection team verifies the destruction
of Iraq's biological, chemical and nuclear weapons and the missiles
used to deliver them are the sanctions to be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter, a former U.S. Marine, was scathingly criticized by Iraq
while he was an inspector on the U.N. Special Commission, the old
inspection team. He made headlines in January 1998 when his team
pulled out of Iraq during a standoff over U.N. access to
''sensitive'' sites. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan broke the
impasse by negotiating a short-lived deal for inspectors to have
access to the sites.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter resigned in August 1998. At the time, he denounced the
Clinton administration for having withdrawn support for the
inspection team and undermining weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
   He has since said Washington used the U.N. agency to spy on Iraq
-- a longtime charge by Baghdad that Ritter himself had denied until
recently. Most recently, he has said Iraq no longer has the ability
to create or deploy weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Special Commission has been replaced by a similar body,
the U.N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission, which
hopes to start work in Iraq in August. It is not clear whether the
Iraqi government will cooperate with the new inspectors, or even
let them in.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter told the Iraqi reporters the new commission appears
doomed to fail and that the U.N. Security Council should redefine
Iraq's disarmament obligations. The Security Council, he said,
should promise to remove the sanctions if Iraq agrees to allow
inspectors back in.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. weapons inspectors left the country in late 1998. In
December of that year, the United States and Britain began air
strikes meant to punish Iraq for failing to cooperate with the
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   There has been ''a lot of irresponsible speculation,'' Ritter
said, about what Iraq has been doing since then.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter, who expects to stay in Iraq through the first week of
August, left the hotel Saturday to film Celebrations Square, where
four giant swords made of weapons confiscated during the 1980-88
Iraq-Iran war are displayed. The square is used for celebrations
and military marches attended by President Saddam Hussein.

<HEADLINE> Rally Falls Flat in Indonesia  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL COONEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- A rally meant to bolster flagging
fortunes of Indonesia's beleaguered head of state fell flat
Saturday when his vice president failed to show up.
</P>
<P>
   Billed as a show of unity between President Abdurrahman Wahid
and his deputy, Megawati Sukarnoputri, the lackluster gathering
drew a far smaller crowd than predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Megawati's absence fueled speculation of a rift within Wahid's
10-month-old coalition ahead of a crucial meeting of the nation's
highest legislative body, the People's Consultative Assembly, which
can dismiss the president.
</P>
<P>
   The assembly elected Wahid over Megawati last October after he
promised to institute sweeping reforms to fix deep problems across
the sprawling Southeast Asian nation that include separatist and
religious violence.
</P>
<P>
   Political analyst Dede Oetomo said it was clear Megawati was
moving away from Wahid.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is definitely a rift,'' he said. ''It's going to make it
very difficult for Wahid to lead effectively without her support.''
</P>
<P>
   Jakarta's main sports stadium, the site for Saturday's rally,
was less than one-third full.
</P>
<P>
   Flyers handed out on the capital's streets days before had
called on members of Wahid's massive Nahdlatul Ulama Muslim
organization and supporters of Megawati's powerful Indonesian
Democratic Party of Struggle to attend. Fewer than 20,000 turned
up.
</P>
<P>
   Rally organizers said the vice president was attending another
meeting in the western Javanese city of Bandung.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the rally, the Indonesian Observer newspaper quoted
Megawati, the daughter of Indonesia's founding President Sukarno,
as saying national leaders should not ''involve the masses in
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   While Wahid has reined in the once powerful military, the
crisis-ridden economy remains stalled and bloody separatist and
sectarian conflicts rage in several provinces.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid's maverick style of administration and his habit of making
contradictory statements have fueled discontent within the
political elite.
</P>
<P>
   Megawati's party has been angered by Wahid's decision to fire
one of its top officials from the Cabinet and his refusal to tell
the parliament why.
</P>
<P>
   Disgruntled senior lawmakers have promised not to launch
impeachment proceedings against Wahid during the assembly's annual
session, which starts on Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid made a brief speech Saturday laced with details of
Indonesia's struggle against Dutch colonial rule half a century
ago. He urged the nation to come together again.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am confident that we will prove as soon as possible our
national unity with the end of violence in Aceh, Maluku and Irian
Jaya,'' he said in reference to Indonesia's main troublespots.
</P>
<P>
   Some legislators are worried about Wahid's state of health. The
59-year-old leader has suffered a series of strokes in recent years
and is almost blind.
</P>
<P>
   During the nationally televised gathering, Wahid repeatedly fell
asleep as Muslim clerics prayed for peace.

<HEADLINE> Castro Lashes At American Policies  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Cuba (AP) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro attacked
the Clinton administration Saturday for trying to undermine his
socialist revolution by increasing contacts between Americans and
Cubans, saying the movement cannot be destroyed, ''not by force nor
by seduction.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing below a huge statue of Ernesto ''Che'' Guevara, Castro
told more than 200,000 people that the U.S. trade embargo and other
American policies aimed at Cuba have only strengthened his
revolution. The speech was one of a series of major national events
organized to commemorate the start of the revolution that brought
Castro to power on New Year's Day 1959.
</P>
<P>
   The sprawling crowd gathered around the monument dedicated to
revolutionary hero Guevara in this central city. Participants, many
of them wearing T-shirts bearing Guevara's image, waved tiny red,
white and blue flags of stiff paper during the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, the U.S. government has allowed a growing
number of Americans to visit the island for academic, sports,
cultural and religious exchanges with Cuban citizens. Proponents of
the policy say increased contacts with Americans will expose Cubans
to democratic and capitalist ideals.
</P>
<P>
   But Castro, using glasses to read his speech, lashed out at the
38-year U.S. trade embargo and U.S. laws passed in recent years to
strengthen it.
</P>
<P>
   ''The theoreticians and advocates of the imperial policies still
dream that the revolution ... might be subverted with such
appealing methods as the one they have called the policy of
'people-to-people' contact,'' Castro said.
</P>
<P>
   Castro said he didn't mind the contact -- ''but they should play
fair,'' he said. The United States should get rid of the trade
embargo, as well as migration policies Havana says encourage
illegal immigration. They should also allow Americans to visit, do
business and invest in Cuba without restrictions, ''without
ridiculous fear,'' said Castro, who turns 74 next month.
</P>
<P>
   Among the foreign dignitaries in attendance Saturday was Oakland
Mayor Jerry Brown, a former California governor who last week
visited Oakland's sister city, Santiago, Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   People thronged in the main plaza, which features a towering
bronze statue of Guevara. The remains of the Argentine-born
physician, who fought in Cuba's revolution, are entombed in a
mausoleum behind the statue.
</P>
<P>
   The speech was the second of three major events to honor the
1953 attack by Castro on an army barracks that launched the Cuban
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The attack was against the dictatorship of then-President
Fulgencio Batista. Although the attackers were all either killed or
jailed, the movement later regained strength and triumphed in 1959
after Batista fled the country.
</P>
<P>
   The first of this year's events, a Wednesday march, drew a crowd
in Havana that the government estimated at more than 1 million. The
third event will be a gathering in the eastern city of Pinar del
Rio on Aug. 5.
</P>
<P>
   The large gatherings are part of a national campaign to keep up
the pressure on the United States to change its policies toward
Cuba in the wake of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez's return to the
communist island a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father and four grandparents attended Saturday's speech
in Santa Clara, but the boy was not there.

<HEADLINE> Accusations Fly After Peru's Clash  </HEADLINE>
By BILL CORMIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- As President Alberto Fujimori went about the
business of setting up his new administration Saturday, charges
were flying in Peru about who was to blame for the deadly street
clashes that marred his inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   New Prime Minister Federico Salas, sworn in earlier in the day
to his largely ceremonial post, blamed organizers of an
anti-Fujimori march that brought tens of thousands of demonstrators
into the capital this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hold these organizers directly responsible for all that
went on,'' Salas said.
</P>
<P>
   His comments came a day after Friday's rioting, which left
downtown buildings in flames, six people dead and 80 more hurt.
Peruvians furious with Fujimori's inauguration to an unprecedented
third five-year term battled thousands of police, and tear gas and
smoke darkened skies over Lima, the capital.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators were protesting Fujimori's victory in a
controversial May 28 election boycotted by his main challenger. The
challenger, Alejandro Toledo, said a fair election could not be
assured, and international monitors severely questioned the vote.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, streetsweepers in orange coveralls scrubbed such
slogans as ''Down with dictatorship!'' off downtown walls and swept
away shattered glass. Police pulled the last two victims of a fire
at a state bank from the building, carrying them out in black body
bags.
</P>
<P>
   Small squads of riot police stood on major street corners,
shields nearby. But tensions had lifted and security was noticeably
scaled back from the 40,000 police who countered the protests
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Salas, the new prime minister, did not name the organizers he
blamed for the riots, but it was clear who he meant: Toledo, the
54-year-old Stanford-trained economist who had planned for
''peaceful resistance'' to the inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference Friday night after the demonstrations
turned violent, Toledo blamed the unrest on what he said were
dozens of pro-Fujimori infiltrators sent to discredit the
protesters. He said Fujimori was ''inaugurated behind the tanks and
rifles because he does not have the support of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter who was at fault, political analysts said, the
inauguration foretold a period of polarization in a society
increasingly opposed to Fujimori's rule.
</P>
<P>
   Political analyst Santiago Pedraglio said Friday's chaos in the
capital showed that Peru's long-splintered opposition movement has
a newfound ability to mobilize tens of thousands of people against
the authoritarian government.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite the lamentable violence and the terrible deaths
yesterday, it is undeniable that the opposition now appears to be
more solid and more unified,'' Pedraglio said. ''Many of those who
mobilized don't identify themselves with any political party. There
is a very large sector of citizenry that no longer wants
Fujimori.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori touts the achievements of his government, including the
defeat of leftist insurgencies and an end to economic chaos in the
early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But many Peruvians say they are tired of Fujimori's blatant
disregard for democratic checks and balances and his failure to
deliver on promises of jobs. In a country of 26 million, half of
the work force fails to make the minimum wage of $120 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like former opposition Congresswoman Lourdes Flores Nano,
openly worry about a government increasingly bereft of popular
support and whose authority is questioned.
</P>
<P>
   ''The inauguration of a new term lacks the one central element
for the stability of government: legitimacy,'' Flores Nano wrote in
a column for El Comercio. ''This is not a good start and doesn't
bode well.''
</P>
<P>
   Filling out his government posts Saturday, Fujimori swore in
Carlos Bolona, an Oxford-educated economist, as the new finance
minister.
</P>
<P>
   Bolona previously served in the post from 1991 to 1992, bringing
hyperinflation under control and overhauling a once-moribund
economy. He imposed an austerity plan that slashed subsidies and
eventually reaped some $8 billion for the state from
privatizations.
</P>
<P>
   Observers had closely watched Fujimori's choice for the finance
post as a sign of Peru's direction on economic policy. Sound
leadership is considered by many key for Fujimori to meet targets
he announced Friday: He said he wants to expand the economy at a 6
percent clip each year for the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   The business community was alarmed in recent weeks when Fujimori
pushed through Congress several seemingly populist measures,
cutting tax incentives for the mining sector and apparently veering
away from a free-market course.

<HEADLINE> Fed. Subsidies Raise Farm Incomes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An outpouring of government subsidies will
push net U.S. farm income to $46.1 billion this year, a 6 percent
increase from last year, the Agriculture Department says.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has approved three multibillion-dollar bailouts of the
farm economy in as many years, and government farm payments are
likely to reach $22.7 billion this year, $2.1 billion above 1999,
according to a report by USDA's Economic Research Service.
</P>
<P>
   Cash receipts also will be up this year from crops and
livestock, but production expenses also are higher, largely because
of increased fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   Grain prices collapsed in 1998 and have yet to recover because
of a succession of bumper crops in the United States and around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ''With large supplies of most agricultural commodities and
prospects of little or no near-term growth in demand, prices for
major crops will likely remain low,'' the July 26 report said.
</P>
<P>
   Total production expenses are forecast at $198.8 billion this
year, up 3.5 percent over 1999 and the first significant rise since
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Land values, meanwhile, are expected to rise 2 percent this
year, reflecting the rise in farm income and higher real estate
prices near urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   Farm debt is down slightly from last year, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Evangelicals Open Big Conference  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD N. OSTLING
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Rev. Billy Graham, recovering from
brain surgery, was too sick Saturday to deliver opening remarks by
satellite TV to a huge, $40 million evangelical conference, the
culmination of years of work by his ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, 81, is in Rochester, Minn., for outpatient therapy at
the Mayo Clinic following an operation to relieve a blockage of
fluid to the brain. He had previously decided not to come to the
Netherlands for his Amsterdam 2000 meeting and had planned to
address the 10,000 evangelicals long-distance.
</P>
<P>
   But shortly before the scheduled satellite uplink Saturday, ''he
felt he lacked the energy and strength, following a sleepless
night'' and asked that his son Franklin read his opening greeting
instead, spokesman Larry Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   In the address, Graham said: ''We have come together to discover
how the evangelical church worldwide can further the kingdom of God
by the proclamation of the Gospel.'' He hopes to offer remarks by
satellite at the closing rally Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
   The 10,000 participants were disappointed at the absence of
their patron saint from the gathering here. But ''the great God is
here nevertheless and he is going to do his work,'' said the Rev.
Tom Simbo of the Evangelical Fellowship of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Amsterdam 2000 is the culminating international event in
Graham's long career, symbolically passing the torch to a new
generation of Bible-based conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   The 300 speakers and workshop teachers are mostly from North
America and Western Europe or affiliated with organizations based
there. But of the participants -- chosen from 28,000 people who
applied to the Minneapolis-based Billy Graham Evangelistic
Association -- three-fourths come from developing nations. About 92
percent are men.
</P>
<P>
   Most are evangelistic preachers, those Graham calls ''unsung
heroes of the faith.''
</P>
<P>
   The opening meeting Saturday had the nostalgic flavor of a
Graham revival, with his 91-year-old singer George Beverly Shea
offering a solo and veteran songleader Cliff Barrows leading a
hymn. The main speaker was the Rev. Billy Jang Hwan Kim of Suwon,
South Korea, pastor of a 13,000-member Baptist church and national
president of the Far East Broadcasting Company, a shortwave radio
ministry.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate prepared statement issued to the conference
Saturday, Graham said some participants ''come from parts of the
world that are in the grip of resurgent religions or ideologies
which deny the heart of the Gospel.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Others of you face rampant secularism or materialism, with
their indifference or even hostility to the Gospel,'' he wrote.
''Or you may live among postmodern people who deny there is even
such a thing as truth.''
</P>
<P>
   In all situations, he said, evangelists must imitate the
boldness of the first Christians in the New Testament Book of Acts:
''They knew what the Gospel was, and they were willing to stake
their lives on their conviction that it was true.''
</P>
<P>
   During the weeklong conference, hundreds of participants will
develop policy statements on theology, strategy and church
relations to be issued on the closing day.
</P>
<P>
   Only Graham's organization could have mounted such a costly and
complex event. Plenary sessions are being translated into 25
languages and transmitted by Internet webcast. Some 7,000 attendees
are living in a temporary mass dormitory in Utrecht and commuting
daily by special trains.
</P>
<P>
   Other speakers during the week will include Archbishop of
Canterbury George Carey and Charles Colson, the onetime Watergate
felon turned prison evangelist.

   ATLANTA (AP) -- Two Republicans, one a former senator and the
other a businessman, said Saturday they plan to challenge former
Democratic Gov. Zell Miller for the seat of the late Sen. Paul
Coverdell.
</P>
<P>
   Mack Mattingly, who held the seat from 1980 to 1986, was a
political ally of Coverdell and talked with the Republican weekly
before Coverdell's unexpected death July 18. Lewis Jordan has never
run for office but he gained public praise for his candor while
chairman of ValuJet after a 1996 plane crash in the Florida
Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   State Republican Party chairman Chuck Clay said Saturday that
both men would be ''first-rate'' candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've always preferred being behind a single candidate, but I'm
not going to tell people of this quality what they should do,''
Clay said, adding that it might be healthy for the party for both
to run.
</P>
<P>
   However, many Georgia Republicans believe the party's best
chance of beating Miller in the special Nov. 7 election is to unite
behind a single candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, picked by Gov. Roy Barnes to fill Coverdell's seat until
the election, had an 85 percent approval rating when he left the
governor's office in 1998 after the maximum eight consecutive
years.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's eight Republican congressmen refused to challenge him,
but Mattingly said Saturday that he isn't intimidated.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Republican conservative philosophy that elected Paul and
elected me -- that's what the voters want. I'm adamant about
protecting that effort, those principles and the rights of the
people of Georgia who elected Paul,'' Mattingly said.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, 56, said other politicians convinced him the party ''is
in an unusual situation where the entire campaign will take place
in 90 days and I may be in a position right now to be the best hope
for the succession to Sen. Coverdell's seat.''
</P>
<P>
   Because he is a political unknown, Jordan said he is prepared to
launch a campaign with his own money.
</P>
<P>
   Both men stopped short of making an official announcement
Saturday, though Mattingly said he planned to address the Georgia
delegation to the Republican National Convention on Sunday.
Qualifying for the non-partisan special election is from Wednesday
to Friday.
</P>
<P>
   State Democratic Party chairman David Worley said Saturday that
neither man could beat Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ''While I'm sure Mr. Jordan is a political consultant's dream
from the standpoint of his bank account, I don't think he's much of
a threat to Zell Miller,'' he said. Of Mattingly, Worley said:
''Half the voters of this state weren't even old enough to vote the
last time he got elected statewide.''

<HEADLINE> USDA To Issue Rules for Producers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Agriculture Department is preparing new
rules intended to protect the rights of farmers and ranchers in
their dealings with livestock and poultry processors.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the regulations will require that processors
disclose basic terms of contracts with producers. The rules, to be
issued this fall, also would bar disclosure restrictions that
prevent producers from getting financial and legal advice on
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our goal is to ensure there is fair competition in the
marketplace and to help small farmers and ranchers compete more
effectively,'' Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said. ''These new
rules will help level the playing field by increasing the
transparency of market transactions.''
</P>
<P>
   Glickman stopped short of acting on a petition filed almost four
years ago by the Western Organization of Resource Councils to curb
the buying powers of meatpackers. Glickman said he would hold a
series of public meetings in September on the petition.
</P>
<P>
   The petition asked Glickman to prohibit meatpackers from owning
cattle and from buying cattle under contract unless done so on the
open market.
</P>
<P>
   Other new rules the department plans would:
</P>
<P>
   --Prohibit conditional purchases in which the purchase of animals
from one seller is tied to the purchase of animals from another
seller.
</P>
<P>
   --Require that packers specify why they pay different prices for
cattle of similar quality.
</P>
<P>
   More and more farmers and livestock producers raise crops and
animals under contract with large processors.
</P>
<P>
   Many producers say that contracting makes it easier to manage
their financial risks, but critics of the practice say it threatens
the independence of farmers and ranchers.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Cornwell, president-elect of the National Cattlemen's Beef
Association, said the proposed rules ''could increase market
transparency and lead to greater profitability by making more
market information available to cattle producers.''

<HEADLINE> Fiji Rebel Leader Imprisoned  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Fiji rebel leader George Speight, who held
dozens of hostages in Parliament for eight weeks, was himself
imprisoned on an island Saturday to await charges that could
include treason, the military said.
</P>
<P>
   Speight, who was arrested on Wednesday and accused of
threatening the nation's new president, was taken along with six of
his advisers from cells in the city's main army barracks to an
islet less than a mile across and within view of the capital, Suva.
</P>
<P>
   ''They will be under guard until the investigations are over,''
spokesman Lt. Ro Alipate Mataitini said. ''They can try to make a
swim for it, but there are plenty of sharks out there in the
harbor.''
</P>
<P>
   The military has said Speight might face a charge of treason,
carrying a maximum sentence of death.
</P>
<P>
   Speight began the turmoil when he and a group of indigenous
Fijians stormed Parliament on May 19 and held dozens of officials
for two months to press his demands that the minority ethnic
Indians be stripped of political power.
</P>
<P>
   The army, which took power 10 days after the raid, met rebel
demands for an amnesty, discarding the multiracial constitution and
ousting the government of Mahendra Chaudhry, Fiji's first prime
minister of Indian descent. In exchange, Speight released the last
of his hostages on July 13.
</P>
<P>
   But Speight was not appeased and demanded power to influence the
new military-appointed government, threatening civil unrest if he
did not get a say about the new administration
</P>
<P>
   He then torpedoed the swearing in of a government because it
only had two of his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The military arrested Speight on Wednesday night, then within
hours raided a rebel stronghold in the capital, Suva, tear gassing
and arresting more than 350 of his supporters. On Friday, the
military arrestd two more of Speight's men.
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown intensified Saturday with the military warning
that ''stronger measures'' may be taken against rebels who seized a
barracks on an island north of Suva and were holding an unknown
number of townspeople hostage.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have given them an ultimatum,'' Mataitini, the army
spokesman, said of the rebels in Labasa, one of a few remaining
strongholds of Speight support.
</P>
<P>
   Mataitini said the rebels must return all weapons, vacate the
base and release the hostages by midnight Sunday or the military
will take ''more drastic action,'' which could include storming the
barracks.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels claim that ethnic Indians -- first brought to Fiji in
the 1870s by British colonialists as indentured laborers -- have too
much power and are threatening Fijian culture. Ethnic Indians make
up 44 percent of Fiji's 814,000 population and dominate business
and commerce.
</P>
<P>
   A new Fijian government was sworn in Friday and is expected to
prepare the way for elections, possibly in three years. Although it
is strongly pro-indigenous Fijian, it includes no close Speight
supporters. It has one ethnic Indian, a junior minister.
</P>
<P>
   The deposed government called the new administration
discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
   ''It effectively disenfranchises the Indo-Fijian community,''
said former deputy prime minister Tupeni Baba. ''It's an open
invitation for the international community to impose further
sanctions.''
</P>
<P>
   Australia, New Zealand and the United States have imposed
sanctions, demanding the quick restoration of democracy.

<HEADLINE> Arafat: Israel Spreading Lies  </HEADLINE>
By IBRAHIM BARZAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Yasser Arafat set off on a multi-country tour
Saturday to drum up support for the Palestinians in the Middle East
peace process, shrugging off a warning by President Clinton not to
declare an independent state and charging Israel with spreading
lies.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the airport in the Gaza Strip before his departure,
Arafat said his trip aimed to counter ''Israeli propaganda'' about
why the Camp David summit failed. When the two-week meeting ended
Tuesday, Israel blamed the Palestinians for lacking the flexibility
to forge a historic peace deal at the U.S.-mediated summit.
</P>
<P>
   ''They (the Israelis) are trying to put (out) big lies about
what happened at Camp David,'' Arafat said. He did not elaborate,
but the Palestinians have rejected the Israelis' portrayal of them
since the summit as inflexible.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, Arafat met for an hour with French leader Jacques
Chirac. Afterward, he dismissed threats by Clinton that Washington
would review its relationship with the Palestinians if Arafat
presses ahead with plans to unilaterally declare an independent
state on Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like to remind Clinton and the rest of the world that
in fact we should already have proclaimed an independent
Palestinian state -- according to the Oslo accords -- on May 4,
1999,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That was the deadline Arafat had originally set for declaring
statehood if no peace deal was been sealed. He subsequently set a
new date for this September.
</P>
<P>
   ''But after advice from our friends, including President
Clinton, we delayed this date until after Israeli elections,''
Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview broadcast Friday on Israel Television, Clinton
said he was considering, in light of recent events, moving the U.S.
Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Such a move would be a coup for
Israel: Only a few countries have accepted Israel's claim to the
whole city, and Clinton has hedged on making a firm decision on the
embassy in light of vehement Palestinian opposition.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Clinton also said Arafat did not go as far as
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in making significant steps
toward an agreement at Camp David. Taleb Es-Sana, an Arab Israeli
lawmaker, said the Palestinian leader was ''not very happy'' with
Clinton's comments.
</P>
<P>
   Resentment over the Clinton interview spilled into the
Palestinian streets Saturday in demonstrations in the West Bank
town of Nablus. Some 300 Arafat loyalists marched through the
streets, led by a group of masked young men who held M-16 guns and
Kalashnikov rifles and burned a poster of Clinton labeled
''Hypocrite Zionist.'' They also burned a poster of Barak.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 Palestinian students protested at Nablus' An Najah
University, burning Israeli flags and listening to speakers condemn
Clinton's comments.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments reverberated elsewhere in the region, as
well, reawakening Arab fears and casting doubt on U.S.
impartiality.
</P>
<P>
   ''We regret this flagrant American bias toward Israel,'' said
Jordan's second largest newspaper, ad-Dustour, in an editorial
entitled: ''The dishonest referee unveils his bias.''
</P>
<P>
   On the streets of Amman, the capital, the tone was less
measured.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without Jerusalem, there will be no peace with the Arabs and
the only solution then is resistance,'' said jeweler Ibrahim
Hreishah, 32.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Issa Musharbash, 50, a dentist, said Clinton's remarks
''prove that Jews control the world, including America.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians demand sovereignty over traditionally Arab east
Jerusalem, which Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast
war.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has long insisted that Jerusalem remain united under
exclusive Israeli sovereignty. But at the Camp David summit, Barak
reportedly offered the Palestinians control of Arab neighborhoods
just inside Jerusalem, a vaguely defined ''special regime'' in the
Muslim and Christian quarters of the walled Old City,
administrative autonomy over Jerusalem's Muslim holy places and
unhindered access to Al-Aqsa, a holy mosque. Palestinian
negotiators reportedly rejected the offer as not going far enough.
</P>
<P>
   Although the summit's failure has put future peacemaking in
question, both sides have pledged to continue their efforts.
Palestinian and Israeli negotiators were to resume interim peace
talks Sunday in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   After visiting France, which assumed the six-month rotating
European Union presidency this month, Arafat is expected to travel
to Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Tunisia.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Appeals to Asian-Americans  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- President Clinton did something Saturday that he
has rarely done since the fund-raising scandals of the 1996
Clinton-Gore re-election campaign: He asked an audience of
Asian-Americans for political donations.
</P>
<P>
   Helping raise some $250,000 for his wife's Senate campaign,
Clinton told an audience of about 200 Korean-Americans, most of
them first-generation immigrants, that they can take part in
political life in several ways, including writing checks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Korean-Americans can have a big impact on this
election in New York and in the United States if you're willing to
participate,'' Clinton said, as he praised what he called the
community's strong work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats recruited Asian-Americans hard four years ago, but
have made fewer public overtures since illegal donations and
questionable fund-raising tactics became the crux of a Justice
Department investigation into the 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore's attendance at a 1996 fund-raiser at a
California Buddhist temple led to $60,000 in illegal donations to
Democrats. Gore has said he did not know the event, organized by a
Chinese-American businesswoman, was a fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's luncheon speech at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New
York is part of Clinton's increasingly heavy campaign schedule on
behalf of Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the family's usual summer vacation, Clinton plans two
''Hillary 2000'' fund-raising addresses on the Massachusetts resort
islands of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as I know, I have now run my last race,'' Clinton said.
''I'll never be a candidate for anything again,'' and will instead
focus on electing his wife and other Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The president gave a less partisan version of his standard
fund-raising appeal, including a request for support in passing a
federal law on the punishment of hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even though America has made great progress in overcoming our
past in discrimination on the basis of race of race or ethnic
origin or religion, we still have instances in our country where
people are subject to discrimination, and we all know it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats support broad hate crimes legislation, while the
Republican leadership in Congress opposes it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clear choice, huge differences, most people don't know it
yet,'' Clinton said in summing up his pitch for Democratic
candidates in general this year. ''You can help.''
</P>
<P>
   The partisan elbows were sharper in the president's weekly radio
address broadcast earlier Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In it, he contended that Republican leaders in Congress have
cost each of the nation's lowest-paid workers ''more than $900 in
hard-earned pay'' by delaying action on an increase in the minimum
wage.
</P>
<P>
   ''As recently as this week, the majority in Congress was still
talking about raising the minimum wage, but they couldn't bring
themselves to actually do it,'' Clinton said as Congress began its
monthlong summer recess.
</P>
<P>
   Congress last raised the minimum hourly wage to $5.15 in October
1997. More than a year ago, the administration proposed a $1
increase, and said it would mean $2,000 a year to a full-time
worker earning minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the last hours before their recess, they were still working
overtime to give tax breaks to the tiniest, wealthiest fraction of
America's families and still doing nothing for the 10 million
people who would benefit from a boost in the minimum wage,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-led House and Senate have each passed bills that
would increase the minimum wage by $1, but they attached a variety
of tax breaks sought by GOP conservatives -- and opposed by Clinton
-- to ease the impact of the wage boost on small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating matters, a Senate minimum-wage measure was
attached to a bankruptcy overhaul bill that has been bogged down in
negotiations with the House.
</P>
<P>
   Republican National Committee spokesman Cliff May said in a
statement that Clinton could solve the hangups quickly ''if he
would work in a bipartisan manner with Congress to find a solution.
But he doesn't want a solution; he wants an issue for Al Gore and
Hillary Clinton, and that's very disappointing.

<HEADLINE> Concorde's Blown Tire Probed  </HEADLINE>
By JOCELYN GECKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Investigators searching for the cause of the Air
France Concorde crash combed through wreckage and examined debris
in high-tech labs Saturday, trying to confirm whether a tire
explosion triggered its fiery plunge.
</P>
<P>
   A tire blew out on the supersonic jet's undercarriage as it
raced down the runway at Charles de Gaulle airport for takeoff,
France's Transport Ministry confirmed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts forged ahead at the crash site and in scientific labs
Saturday to determine whether the blown tire started the deadly
chain of events that led to an engine breakdown and the crash that
killed 114 people, a spokesman at the ministry's Accident and
Inquiry office said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have asked the Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber Co. for
information on tires that the U.S.-based company supplied for the
plane to determine if tire debris found on the runway came from the
supersonic jet, Chris Aked, a company spokesman based in Ohio, was
quoted as saying in Saturday's Beacon Journal newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear spokesman David Russ said it was too soon to tell if a
tire explosion caused Tuesday's crash. ''It's way too early to make
any assumptions or comments like that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   French officials raised the death toll by one Friday after
discovering another body beneath the rubble of a hotel struck by
the crashing Concorde. The victim's sex and nationality were not
immediately identifiable. Four other bystanders died when the plane
slammed into the hotel in Gonesse, a town near the airport.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary report on Tuesday's crash is due to be published
at the end of August, but just three days after the tragedy, a
sketchy image of the sequence of events has surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   ''At least one tire exploded, which could have triggered a chain
of events, structural damages, a fire and an engine breakdown,''
the Transport Ministry said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Accident and Inquiry Office earlier said that one or two of
the wheels on the left side landing gear may have blown out and
that the fire that ravaged the jetliner did not necessarily start
in the engines.
</P>
<P>
   An initial report from the ministry on Thursday had raised the
specter of something as mundane as a puncture being involved. It
said tire debris had been found strewn along the runway.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators know that engine No. 2 failed, that the pilot
could not draw up the undercarriage and that engine No. 1 lost
power -- once on the runway, and again, fatally, less than one
minute into the flight. The Concorde has four engines, two under
each wing.
</P>
<P>
   Blown-out tires have been blamed for past brushes with
near-disaster, despite Concorde's seemingly spotless safety record.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board reported
five ''potentially catastrophic'' incidents resulting from
blown-out tires during Concorde takeoffs between June 1979 and
February 1981.
</P>
<P>
   British Airway's fleet of seven Concorde has suffered about 12
blown tires since 1988, London's Sunday Times quoted an
unidentified executive at the airline as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The paper also reported Sunday that Britain's Civil Aviation
Authority issued emergency safety warnings in 1998 detailing
problems with the Concorde's engines. The problems included cracks
in the engine cooling rings, compressor discs and exhaust vanes, as
well as frayed wires. The cracks had caused ''significant damage''
to the engine turbines that could cause an engine fire, the paper
quoted the report as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The unidentified British Airways executive told the paper that
the problems had posed no immediate threat to the planes' safety.
He said the warnings, which were also passed on to Air France and
the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, were acted upon.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its excellent safety record, the Concorde is famously
''fragile'' and according to a report Saturday in the Paris daily,
Liberation, requires exhaustive maintenance that accounts for 50
percent of the plane's operation cost, compared to around 10
percent for most other planes.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 100 passengers aboard flight AF4590 were German
tourists headed to New York to board a luxury cruise to the
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and colleagues of the nine crew members who died in the
crash attended a memorial service Friday at Air France's
headquarters at the Charles de Gaulle airport.
</P>
<P>
   Speakers praised the crew's professionalism. Many of the
mourners bowed their heads, others cried in their handkerchiefs.
One woman fainted.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a very moving ceremony,'' said Gerard Feldzer, an Air
France pilot. ''Each one of us was touched.''
</P>
<P>
   In Gonesse, residents walked silently in a procession from the
town hall toward the site where the Concorde went down in a ball of
fire.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Jean-Pierre Blazy walked at the front with the owner of
the destroyed hotel, Michele Fricheteau, whose arms were wrapped in
white bandages and face was scattered with burns.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're still in shock. It's a time for reverent silence, pain
and emotion,'' Blazy said.
</P>
<P>
   Transport Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot, who has grounded all Air
France Concorde flights, said Friday he wanted across-the-board
supplementary security procedures before allowing the supersonic
jets to take to the sky again.
</P>
<P>
   Air France said its jets would remain grounded until further
notice.

<HEADLINE> Chicago-Area IRS Workers Suspended  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- At least eight Internal Revenue Service employees
have been suspended during an investigation into whether IRS
workers took bribes in exchange for helping taxpayers with such
things as halting collection actions and providing transcripts of
accounts, according to published reports.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported Saturday that Charlie Turek,
president of the National Treasury Employees Union local in
Chicago, and lawyers familiar with the case expect a federal grand
jury to hand down indictments.
</P>
<P>
   The paper said the workers, who are employed at four Chicago
offices, were suspended with pay three weeks ago and were told they
would be fired.
</P>
<P>
   A message left at the union was not immediately returned
Saturday. Turek does not have a home telephone listing.
</P>
<P>
   Early editions of Sunday's Chicago Sun-Times cited unidentified
sources close to the investigation as saying that tape recordings
caught at least two employees allegedly accepting payoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun-Times, citing sources, reported that the employees
include a customer-service representative who allegedly accepted
payments of up to $50 to give preferential treatment to taxpayers
or to provide transcripts of proceedings in a taxpayer's account.
Confidential transcript information could enable a creditor to file
a claim for someone else's refund or for a lawyer or accountant to
solicit a delinquent taxpayer for business.
</P>
<P>
   David C. Williams, the inspector general, declined comment to
the Times on the investigation. IRS spokesman William Rivkin would
neither confirm nor deny the investigation to the Sun-Times.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Demographic Decline Grows  </HEADLINE>
By ANGELA CHARLTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Over the past six years, Dr. Irina Budnikova has
examined thousands of Russian women who want to give birth but
can't -- women who have had six miscarriages, women whose ovaries
atrophied before they turned 30, women so anemic that pregnancy
made them faint daily.
</P>
<P>
   These problems, she says, combined with Russia's still
staggering abortion rate, are helping drive Russia's demographic
decline.
</P>
<P>
   ''The population keeps getting sicker. That's one reason the
birth rate is going down,'' she said, blaming widespread poverty,
disintegrating health care, environmental hazards and poor
nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   Fertility problems are just one facet of a trend that deeply
disturbs this bedraggled nation: Russia's population, currently
around 145 million, is shriveling at a tempo unheard of in the
modern era. At the current rate of decrease, demographers predict
the world's largest country will have a population smaller than
Japan's -- 125 million -- within 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   President Vladimir Putin warned in his first state of the nation
address last month, ''If this continues, the survival of the nation
will be in jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   Half of Russian men die before they can retire at age 60, as
heart disease, alcoholism and smoking escalate unchecked. And
Russian women aren't having children, or at least not enough. The
country's birth rate has halved since 1988 to 1.3 children per
woman, according to the Statistics Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Most avoid childbirth by choice -- either by not having children
or by ending their pregnancies. Russia has the world's highest
abortion rate, with two of three pregnancies ending in abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Some women don't have that choice. Russia's Health Ministry and
other experts estimate that 10 percent to 25 percent of Russian
couples are infertile, and that many of them never turn to
professionals for help.
</P>
<P>
   And infant mortality is on the rise, a phenomenon extremely rare
for an industrialized nation. Some obstetricians say one-tenth of
Russian newborns die of infections.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have sick women, and they're having sick pregnancies,''
Budnikova said in her office at the city-funded Center for Family
Planning and Reproduction in southern Moscow. She said the
maternity ward used to handle 36 births a day when she started
working there in 1994; now it handles just 10 daily.
</P>
<P>
   In another wing of the clinic, Anya Morozova waited for an
examination. Morozova, 18, is four months pregnant and juggling
medications to protect her fetus from the herpes virus that she
contracted last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't know much about women's health issues before I got
pregnant,'' she said quietly, twirling her woven purse strap
nervously.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at the clinic suggested one reason for increasing
reproductive problems is that Russian women are having sex earlier,
in their mid-teens. That gives a woman more chances to contract
infections that could affect childbearing.
</P>
<P>
   It also increases the chances that a woman will have more than
one abortion before she has a baby. A history of multiple abortions
can increase the risk of complications during pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Though contraceptives are increasingly available in Russia, they
are still mistrusted or misunderstood, and abortion remains the
primary method of birth control. It is also free, unlike birth
control, which is relatively expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Andrei Akopian, a fertility specialist and director of the
Republic Center for Human Reproduction, blamed a weak tradition of
preventive health care and deteriorating food and water quality for
the problems he encounters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Prevention is the number one priority,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Government spending on medicine has shriveled in recent years,
but the vast majority of the population still depends on public
facilities. Women's clinics lay patients on tattered cots and use
old, stiff speculums.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors also say a legacy of Soviet environmental destruction
has damaged the health of millions of Russians.
</P>
<P>
   The government promised this spring to spend $125 million in the
next two years on a program aimed at increasing the birth rate.
</P>
<P>
   While birth rates are declining in most of Europe, it's
happening faster in Russia and for different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Many potential Russian mothers are insecure about the future.
Russia's economy has seen little but decline for the past decade.
Paychecks and employment are no longer guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite her health problems, Morozova is hopeful for her
unborn child.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want all the best for my baby,'' she said. ''Times are
always tough. That's not enough of a reason not to have children.''

<HEADLINE> Politician Killed in Basque Region  </HEADLINE>
By MAR ROMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Two assailants shot and killed a Socialist
politician in the Basque region Saturday in what police said was
the 10th attack by the armed separatist ETA group in the last two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Juan Maria Jauregui, a former representative of the
Interior Ministry in northern Guipuzcoa Province, was shot twice in
the head inside a bar in the town of Tolosa, 290 miles north of
Madrid. He was rushed to a hospital, where he died several hours
later.
</P>
<P>
   The state-run Efe news agency said witnesses saw two men, each
between 30 and 35 years old and wearing dark glasses, running from
the bar after the shooting. Later, a car that may have been the
getaway vehicle exploded and burned in a nearby town.
</P>
<P>
   Although no one immediately claimed responsibility, police and
local news media blamed ETA, the armed Basque separatist group.
Jauregui, 49, served as representative of the Interior Ministry --
which directs national security forces -- from 1993-1996.
</P>
<P>
   Jauregui, who was married and had a 19-year-old daughter, was on
vacation in Spain at the time of the shooting. He has been living
in Chile as a director of a chain of airport shops.
</P>
<P>
   If the slaying proves to be the work of ETA, it would confirm
that the clandestine organization is waging its most violent
offensive since breaking a 14-month cease-fire in December. Just
this month, ETA has been blamed for nine other attacks, including
the killing of Jose Maria Martin Carpena, a town councilor in the
southern city of Malaga.
</P>
<P>
   ''ETA is trying to test our cohesion as a society and our most
strongly held democratic convictions,'' federal government
spokesman Pio Cabanillas said hours after the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja, national civilian head of
federal security forces, said the latest attack would not change
the government's policy of refusing to negotiate ETA's demands for
an independent Basque homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Spain's royal family, headed by King Juan Carlos I, sent
condolences to the family of Jauregui and to the Socialist Party,
calling the shooting a ''cowardly attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Jauregui is to be buried on Sunday in his hometown, Legorreta,
near Tolosa.
</P>
<P>
   After the shooting, hundreds of people including the president
of the Basque regional government gathered before the town hall in
Tolosa to protest the slaying. Jauregui's wife, Isabel Lasa, and
daughter, Maria, joined neighbors in a silent vigil in Legorreta.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 800 people have been killed since 1968 in attacks blamed
on the ETA and its campaign for Basque independence. ETA is a
Basque-language acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere Saturday, national police chief Juan Cotino said two
suspected ETA members who were arrested Friday had been preparing
an assassination attempt against Mayor Jose Atares of the
northeastern city of Zaragoza. Cotino said an explosive device and
other evidence was found in the house where the two were arrested.

<HEADLINE> 9 Killed in Brazil Train Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- A fast-moving train barreled down a
hill without braking and rammed another train that was stopped to
board commuters, killing nine and injuring 115, authorities said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The two trains collided during Friday morning rush hour at a
station in Perus, 40 miles northwest of San Paulo, said the Sao
Paulo Metropolitan Train Company.
</P>
<P>
   The company said a train carrying only an engineer and his
assistant failed to brake as it roared downhill, gathering speed
until it entered the station and struck the commuter train, which
was parked at a platform. The assistant engineer of the runaway
train was among those killed, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The impact destroyed four train cars. Firefighters using
acetylene torches cut open the twisted metal and removed seven
bodies. Scores of people were treated for broken bones and other
injuries. Two later died at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Company President Oliver Hossepian said the crash probably was
caused by human error or mechanical failure in the brakes. ''The
train took off because the brakes didn't work or because they
weren't used,'' Hossepian said.

<HEADLINE> Chechen Rebels Hit Russian Column  </HEADLINE>
By LYOMA TURPALOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Chechen rebels attacked a column of
Russian vehicles heading from the capital Grozny on Saturday toward
the Argun gorge combat zone in southern Chechnya, wounding at least
one soldier.
</P>
<P>
   The motorcade had left the Grozny suburb of Khankala and was
moving south down a highway when it was ambushed by the rebels near
the village of Prigorodnoye, military officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses at the scene of the fighting said several people were
killed in a subsequent 40-minute shootout, which left a truck
destroyed. The office of Sergei Yastrzhembsky, the government's
chief spokesman on Chechnya, said in a statement that one soldier
was wounded and none was killed.
</P>
<P>
   NTV commercial television reported that the column was escorted
by helicopter gunships, but that the helicopters had turned back to
base before the attack occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The Argun gorge, about 11 miles south of the ambush site, is a
key rebel refuge and supply route leading toward Georgia, the only
foreign country bordering Chechnya. It has been the scene of almost
daily artillery and air bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops occupy most of Chechnya, but have been unable to
wipe out insurgents in the southern mountains or prevent them from
infiltrating Russian-held cities, including Grozny, where they
plant mines and launch hit-and-run attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow sent its troops into Chechnya in September following
militant raids into the neighboring Russian region of Dagestan, and
following the death of some 300 people in apartment bombings the
government blames on Chechen terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   In the neighboring region of Ingushetia, there was an attempt on
the life of Chechen warlord Arbi Barayev, the military's press
center said. It said a bomb exploded near Barayev, but he escaped
uninjured. There were no further details.
</P>
<P>
   Three Russian youths who local authorities say were killed by
Chechen rebels Thursday were buried in the village of Shelkovskaya
in Chechnya on Saturday, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   The three, a 14-year-old girl and a man and a woman, both 21,
were shot and killed at a lake where they were swimming.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Igor Beskorovny, the military commandant for the Shelkovsky
district told ITAR-Tass that the attack was premeditated and the
attackers were waiting for their victims. He said seven suspects in
the shooting have been arrested.

<HEADLINE> Destroyed by fire, church reveals 19th century time capsule  </HEADLINE>
By CRAIG FOX
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMSTERDAM, N.Y. (AP) - Were it not for a fire that destroyed the
United Presbyterian Church last January, congregants may have
missed a glimpse into the church's 19th century past.
</P>
<P>
   The existence of a time capsule, a galvanized metal box set into
a cornerstone in 1870, wasn't known until after church members
walked the site in the fire's aftermath, looking to salvage what
they could from the church that had burned for the fourth time.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's amazing,'' said the Rev. Dan Wheeler. ''I don't know how
it survived.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now, we'll get to see what the congregation was thinking about
when they placed the time capsules there,'' said Maybelle Schere,
87, who has belonged to the church for 65 years.
</P>
<P>
   The pastor and the 310 members of the congregation will soon see
what was placed in the metal box. The time capsule, and a second
one from 1929, will be opened Aug. 15, when the church marks its
200th anniversary on the site where the church stood.
</P>
<P>
   The older time capsule, placed in the cornerstone of the
church's northwest tower, survived the intense heat and flames that
engulfed the building and left it looking like Greek ruins, Wheeler
said.
</P>
<P>
   The commemoration will help church members cope with their loss,
providing support as they shift their focus from devastation to
reconstruction, said the pastor's wife, Marilyn Wheeler.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is going to be very exciting for us, to work on what was
and what will be there for generations to come,'' said Marilyn
Wheeler.
</P>
<P>
   The newer capsule was discovered when the wing was demolished as
a part of last year's renovations, Dan Wheeler said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the blaze, church leaders were planning to include the
1929 time capsule, about the size of a boot box, as a part of the
church's 200th anniversary festivities, Wheeler said.
</P>
<P>
   Since its discovery, the 1870 time capsule has been stored at
the Wheelers' home.
</P>
<P>
   The contents of both time capsules remain a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony will include eight teen-agers who recently became
members of the church through confirmation and some of the oldest
members of the church, Marilyn Wheeler said.
</P>
<P>
   The congregation has started work on building a new church at
the fire site, Pastor Wheeler said. Church members are interviewing
architects to design the new building, estimated to cost $2 million
to $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Construction is not likely to start for 2 years. Until then, the
congregation will continue to meet for Sunday services in the
cafeteria at a nearby Catholic school.
</P>
<P>
   ''This celebration helps us,'' Dan Wheeler said. ''We could be
just looking at the ashes, but we're going to have a party on the
ashes, instead.''
</P>
<P>
   The church was originally founded in 1800 in this Mohawk River
industrial city 30 niles northwest of Albany. That building burned
around 1820. The rebuilt church burned 10 years later. The
congregation moved to its present site in 1830. That building
lasted until 1869 when, some people say, it burned. Others say it
was torn down.
</P>
<P>
   The only part of the church still standing is the southwest
tower. Piles of red bricks litter the otherwise manicured grounds.
The charred church tower bell sits nearly upright, near some
shrubbery on the front lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on cost, church leaders may use the remaining tower as
a memorial to the old church.

<HEADLINE> Kazakstan Closes Nuke Test Facility  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL ROTHBART
<TEXT>
<P>
   POLYGON NUCLEAR TEST SITE, Kazakstan (AP) -- An international
team of scientists destroyed the last of Kazakstan's nuclear test
facilities Saturday, scratching the Central Asian nation from the
list of nuclear-capable countries.
</P>
<P>
   Kazakstan, a former Soviet republic, has worked with the United
States since 1995 to destroy silo launchers for intercontinental
missiles and other nuclear weapons at the vast nuclear testing
grounds in the rocky steppes of northern Kazakstan.
</P>
<P>
   The controlled detonation of 100 tons of explosives in the final
remaining tunnel of the Polygon test site effectively ends
Kazakstan's status as a nation capable of testing and launching
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   As officials watched from a hillside several miles away, a ball
of flame leapt from the tunnel entrance, followed by a shock wave
and blast of wind. The explosion was used to calibrate equipment at
seismic stations around the world to help them monitor future
underground explosions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The event we witnessed today was significant for all of us,''
said Vladimir Shkolnik, Kazakstan's minister of energy, trade and
industry. ''Two issues were resolved, one to do with threat
reduction and the second to do with our ability to monitor future
secret tests.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Koch, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of defense for
threat reduction, said it was ''a truly landmark event, one the
world has never seen before: the elimination of a country's entire
infrastructure for nuclear weapons. We hope this will be an example
to other nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 1949 and 1989, the Soviet Union set off 470 nuclear
explosions at the testing grounds. More than 100 of the tests took
place above ground.
</P>
<P>
   The local population was not warned about possible ill effects
of radiation. The area is sparsely populated, but people living
downwind as far as the city of Semipalatinsk, 125 miles to the east
of the Polygon test site, suffered aftereffects of nuclear
radiation, including high incidences of birth defects and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed Omega 3, Saturday's explosion concluded a five-year
cooperative program between the Kazak and U.S. governments.
</P>
<P>
   The joint effort, organized under the international
Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, closed 118 tunnels and 13
boreholes at the test site.
</P>
<P>
   The test site, once the world's largest nuclear testing ground
covering 32,800 square miles, was ordered shut down in 1991 by
President Nursultan Nazarbayev.

<HEADLINE> Alleged Kidnapper Returns to Germany  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The alleged ringleader of a gang that
kidnapped a German multimillionaire in 1996 arrived Saturday in
Germany, after being jailed in Argentina for more than two years
awaiting extradition.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Drach, 40, is charged with masterminding the kidnapping
of cigarette heir Jan Philipp Reemtsma, and holding him hostage in
a Hamburg cellar for 33 days until the family won his release by
paying $18 million in ransom. So far, $600,000 of the ransom has
been recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Drach, escorted by German police officers, arrived at Frankfurt
International Airport shortly before noon. He was transferred by
helicopter to Hamburg, where he was jailed in Fuhlsbuttel prison,
police spokesman Reinhard Fallak said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a satisfying day for the Hamburg police,'' Fallak said.
</P>
<P>
   Drach, who was arrested in Buenos Aires in March 1998 on false
passport charges, had been living under an assumed name in Uruguay
at the seaside resort of Punta del Este.
</P>
<P>
   A trial date has not been set, but Hamburg prosecutor Ruediger
Bagger said last week it would likely be held this year. Three
other men have already been convicted as accomplices in the
kidnapping and are serving prison terms.
</P>
<P>
   Reemtsma's fortune was earned through the family's cigarette
company, Germany's second largest, which manufactures several
brands, including Peter Stuyvesant.
</P>
<P>
   Reemtsma has pursued his interests of literature and
philanthropy since selling his 53 percent share in the family
business for $150 million at age 27.
</P>
<P>
   He is the main sponsor of a controversial traveling exhibition
on Nazi war crimes in eastern Europe.

<HEADLINE> Rotation To Replace Coverdell  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY McMURRAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- After Georgia Sen. Paul Coverdell's
unexpected death, colleagues predicted that no one person could
replace him. Little did they know it would take more than 50.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than appoint a single alternate to Coverdell's spot as a
delegate to the Republican National Convention, state party
officials have decided to rotate the honor among them all.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was always so inclusive,'' said Eric Tanenblatt, Georgia
campaign manager for Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the GOP
presidential candidate. ''This would be a way to carry on his
spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the state may have found a meaningful way to fill
Coverdell's spot, convention delegates admit his passing will
dampen the party's mood in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's kind of like having a wedding and your caterer and band
don't show up,'' said Dot Burns, who runs Coverdell's political and
financial office in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell, a longtime Bush family friend who had been serving as
the Texas governor's Senate liaison and was heavily involved in
planning the convention, died July 19 after a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   As Georgia's only member of Congress selected as a delegate,
Coverdell also was to lead the delegation to Philadelphia. The duty
now falls to Georgia Republican chairman Chuck Clay, who Coverdell
had name vice chairman of the convention delegation.

<HEADLINE> Opposition To Challenge Milosevic  </HEADLINE>
By ALEKSANDAR VASOVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Leaders of Serbia's major opposition
parties said Saturday they would unite in challenging President
Slobodan Milosevic and his ruling party in presidential and
parliamentary elections in September.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering of leaders, however, did not include the largest
single opposition party, Vuk Draskovic's Serbian Renewal Movement,
which has said it will boycot the election -- casting doubt that the
remaining opposition could beat Milosevic even if united.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen opposition parties ironed out details of joint lists and
their campaign strategy against the ruling regime in the Sept. 24
federal parliament and presidential elections. Earlier in the week,
the front said it would participate in local elections also.
</P>
<P>
   ''Serbia's democratic opposition has united in order to protect
the interests of citizens and to change the regime that is working
against the interest'' of the state, the front said in a statement
released after the five-hour meeting in the capital, Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The parties have yet to decide on a candidate to challenge
Milosevic in the presidential race. Vojislav Kostunica of the
center-right Democratic Party of Serbia, is the likely choice,
according to party sources.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition bloc said its invitation to the Serbian Renewal
Movement to join the coalition remains open.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition's election fight is made even tougher by new
elections pushed through by Milosevic earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic changed the country's constitution, tilting the odds
in his favor by reshuffling election districts in Serbia, the main
Yugoslav republic, and redefining supervisory electoral bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The new law also allows Milosevic to run for two more four-year
terms and requires only a simple majority for victory, regardless
of voter turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Milosevic's crackdown on opposition voices -- including
politicians, student groups and independent media -- continued
Saturday with several arrests of activists reported in at least two
cities in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's constitutional changes included downgrading the
position of Yugoslavia's smaller republic, Montenegro, led by a
pro-Western government that largely ignores Belgrade. Montenegrin
leaders have said they will boycott the elections.
</P>
<P>
   A victory by the ruling regime could push Montenegro, Serbia's
last partner in Yugoslavia, to break away.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday the Socialists -- allied with ultranationalist Radicals
and a neo-communist group led by the president's wife -- predictably
named Milosevic as their candidate for office.
</P>
<P>
   Otpor, a popular opposition student group has announced an
election campaign aimed at Milosevic and called: ''He's Finished.''
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls show Milosevic's popularity has dwindled since
last year's NATO bombing, which forced Yugoslav troops out of the
southern province of Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Company Recalling Ground Beef  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Moyer Packing Co. of Souderton, Pa., is
recalling some 346,700 pounds of ground beef that may be
contaminated with potentially deadly E. coli bacteria, the
Agriculture Department said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The MOPAC brand ground beef was produced on July 11 and packaged
in 5- and 10-pound packages that bear the plant establishment
number 1311 and the date 07/11/00.
</P>
<P>
   They were distributed to wholesalers in Connecticut, Delaware,
Louisiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New York,
Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service said the meat may have
been reground and distributed and sold to retailers. The
contamination was discovered in routine testing.
</P>
<P>
   E. coli O157:H7 bacteria can cause bloody diarrhea and
dehydration and can be fatal in people with weakened immune

<HEADLINE> McCain Won't Rule Out Future Run  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLUE BELL, Pa. (AP) -- John McCain declined Saturday to rule out
a future run for the White House, even as he sought to boost the
campaigns of former presidential primary rival George W. Bush and
Republican congressional candidates.
</P>
<P>
   With some 70 reporters along for the ride, McCain traveled from
Arlington, Va., to Philadelphia in what amounted to a rolling news
conference aboard the ''Straight Talk Express'' bus that carried
him first to glory, then to defeat in the Republican presidential
primaries against Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator insisted his goal was not to overshadow Bush
prior to the Republican National Convention, which begins Monday --
''The beginnings of this trip were entirely innocent,'' he said --
but he did not rule out a run again in 2004 if Bush is defeated by
Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The question, McCain said, is ''could you replicate the kind of
magic and excitement we were able to create? We caught lightning in
a bottle and I don't know if we'd be able to create that again.''
</P>
<P>
   The bus caravan, McCain said, ''will remind us of what a great
time we had.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain was careful to commend Bush for running a ''centrist,
inclusive campaign'' in the GOP traditions of Abraham Lincoln and
Theodore Roosevelt, but he acknowledged some lingering disagreement
with Bush on some issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still don't think you need the size of the tax cut that Bush
advocates,'' McCain said, then added: ''That's all ameliorated by
the growth of the (budget) surplus.''
</P>
<P>
   In Blue Bell, McCain spoke to more than 300 people at a rally in
the gymnasium at Montgomery County Community College. He said a
great challenge is getting cynical young people involved in
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until we get this government of yours out of the hands of the
special interests we will not succeed,'' he said. ''I am convinced
that George Bush and Dick Cheney are going to help us do that.''
</P>
<P>
   One person at the rally, Maryanne Quinn of Wallingford, said,
''The guy who should be running is not.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain spoke in Blue Bell at a campaign event with Pennsylvania
state Sen. Stewart Greenleaf, a Republican running for Congress.
McCain said such races will be crucial in trying to retain
Republican control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who said he will campaign for more than 100 candidates,
told reporters his presence at such events ''earns them
(candidates) the voters' consideration. I don't know of anyone who
will say, 'I'm voting for this candidate because McCain says to,'
especially with independents.''
</P>
<P>
   After Saturday's event, McCain plans to speak at a rival
''shadow convention,'' address his delegates and appear at the
Republican convention in prime time on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain plans to join Bush on a campaign swing through the West
after the convention, playing host to Bush and his wife Laura for a
night at McCain's ranch near Sedona, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was Bush's toughest competitor in the GOP primaries,
drawing independent-minded voters with calls for trimming the
influence of money in politics.
</P>
<P>
   McCain won seven primaries and had 231 delegates before he ended
his presidential bid in March. Some of those delegates have been
replaced by Bush supporters or already have pledged themselves to
Bush. McCain plans to tell his remaining delegates at a Sunday
afternoon meeting to support Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anyone who is missing from my speech to them will lose their
(convention) credentials,'' McCain added jokingly.
</P>
<P>
   Before meeting with his delegates Sunday, McCain will address
the shadow convention organized by satirists, campaign finance
reform advocates and others. While some Republicans grumble that
speaking there is giving aid and comfort to the enemy, McCain said
he will try to win more voters for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''You win elections by winning the center,'' McCain said.

<HEADLINE> Mexico's Fox Visits Ruling Party  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- President-elect Vicente Fox promised his
government will operate separately from his party in Mexico, where
the ruling party has traditionally been synonymous with the
government, a newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to his National Action Party, Fox said the party will
continue as an independent, democratic institution separate from
the presidency. He promised that his government will serve all
Mexicans -- not just members of National Action.
</P>
<P>
   ''The party will continue being a party. The government will be
a government,'' Fox said Friday, quoted by the daily newspaper El
Universal.
</P>
<P>
   On July 2, Fox became the first opposition presidential
candidate to defeat a member of Mexico's Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which has governed the country since
1929.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's stunning election was due largely to voter frustration
with Mexico's ruling party, which was widely criticized for being
corrupt and unresponsive to voter demands for change.
</P>
<P>
   Fox also promised to curtail the power of the central government
by giving more autonomy to Mexico's states.
</P>
<P>
   Fox spoke Friday after meeting with Sinaloa state Gov. Juan S.
Millan, the first governor who is a member of the PRI to invite the
president-elect to his state since Fox's victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our intention is to fulfill our promise ... to prove that each
state, individually, can come out on top,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting came as the Roman Catholic Church urged Fox on
Friday to get back together with his ex-wife, whom he divorced nine
years ago -- or set a moral example for the country by promising not
to remarry.
</P>
<P>
   Nuevo Criterio, a magazine published by the Archdiocese of
Mexico, urged Fox to become a model of family values by avoiding a
second marriage, unlike many past Mexican presidents.

<HEADLINE> Gore To Announce Veep Choice Aug. 8  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WRIGHTSVILLE BEACH, N.C. (AP) -- Al Gore plans to announce his
running mate shortly after the Republicans wrap up their national
convention, hoping to blunt any momentum that presidential rival
George W. Bush might gain.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said the Democratic vice president will announce his
choice Aug. 8 in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   And early next week, during Bush's convention, the Democratic
National Committee will begin running its first negative ad
criticizing the Texas governor. The DNC is spending about $3.5
million to run the ad in 17 states in an effort to get the
Democratic message through the coverage of the GOP convention.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, aides said, Gore was getting closer to a
decision on vice president. Gore himself has said he expects to
narrow the field before he breaks off his oceanside vacation on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Chris Lehane said Gore was pondering a a list of fewer
than 10. ''It's a diverse list,'' said Lehane, who declined to go
beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   Some polls in recent days have shown Bush building a lead even
before next week's GOP convention begins. Presidential candidates
traditionally get a ''bump'' in the polls because of the television
attention they get during a smoothly run convention.
</P>
<P>
   By scheduling a high-profile announcement barely after
Republicans end their convention, Gore is seeking to quickly grab
the spotlight and shift attention to the Democratic convention
beginning Aug. 14 in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had said earlier he had planned to announce his choice a
couple of days before his convention.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes criticized the Gore campaign's
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are more concerned about the political calculation than
who it's going to be. It's a classic microcosm of the Gore
campaign,'' she said. ''They announced first the date when they're
going to make the announcement.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehane said Gore wanted to contrast a serious and sober running
mate selection process with what he called ''a circus'' surrounding
Bush's selection of Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   ''Only Warren Christopher and Al Gore know who is on that
list,'' said Lehane. ''The campaign will make every effort not to
reveal those names.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher is steering Gore's selection process.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry, Florida Sen. Bob Graham and
former Senate leader George Mitchell are often mentioned. Iowa Sen.
Tom Harkin's name has surfaced recently.
</P>
<P>
   House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt has said he doesn't want
to be asked.
</P>
<P>
   Lehane said Gore was considering the issue carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ''Al Gore knows this is one of the most important decisions he
will make,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore aides have been bashing the GOP ticket all week, arguing
that Bush made a mistake by picking a fellow oil company executive
and a staunch conservative, and they are eager to offer a contrast
by quickly announcing Gore's pick.
</P>
<P>
   There was little evidence of haste from the vacationing Gore.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was pondering the question, but that was playing
second fiddle to board games, swimming and putting together a
jigsaw puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're having a good time just relaxing,'' Gore said. Asked if
he'd reached any conclusions about the ticket, he shrugged and
said: ''Not yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president was keeping to his plan for a low-key
vacation with his family.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters and photographers were taken to the private island
where he is vacationing, to watch Gore, wife Tipper, daughter Sarah
and Frank Hunger, husband of Gore's late sister, take a stroll
along the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Shorts and casual shirts were the attire of the day, and Gore
opted for a barefoot walk, pausing occasionally to chat with other
vacationers fishing or splashing in the surf.

<HEADLINE> Albright Performs in Bangkok  </HEADLINE>
By GRANT PECK
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- She may be famous for endurance during
endless negotiations, but when Asian diplomats call U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright a trouper, they mean her song-and-dance
talents.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying on one of diplomacy's less-serious traditions, Albright
and other foreign ministers performed skits and sang songs at a
dinner Friday night to wrap up the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations Regional Forum in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists were not allowed in. But accounts from the audience
and song sheets distributed by delegates -- mostly spoofs of show
tunes tortured into saying something about politics -- suggested the
diplomats shouldn't consider giving up their day jobs anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Albright was in fine form, wearing a bowler hat and swinging a
golf club in a parody of Bob Hope crooning out his signature
''Thanks for the Memories'' -- a fitting song for the twilight of
the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   She directed a barb at Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan --
''When you're not so sweet, I call the Seventh Fleet'' -- and made a
Mae West mockery of a common complaint by smaller nations of
Washington's pushiness: ''Don't worry boys; you can mess around in
my internal affairs anytime!''
</P>
<P>
   Albright, once more dressed for business, then set out for
Tokyo, where she arrived Saturday for two days of talks with Prime
Minister Yoshiro Mori.

   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Delaware's delegation to the Republican convention
docked today at Penn's Landing after a 3&AMP;frac12; hour, 26-mile trip up the
Delaware River in a replica of the Kalmar Nyckel, the ship that in 1863 brought
Swedish colonists to what is now Wilmington. Many of the more than 2,000
delegates attending the convention had arrived earlier in the week, but the bulk
began arriving this afternoon or planned to get in by tomorrow -- with most
using more conventional means of transportation, such as planes, trains and
cars.

Arafat Counters 'Israeli Propaganda'

   PARIS (AP) -- Shrugging off a warning by President Clinton not to declare an
independent state and charging Israel with spreading lies, Yasser Arafat set off
on a multi-country tour Saturday to drum up support for the Palestinians in the
Middle East peace process. Speaking at the airport in the Gaza Strip before his
departure, Arafat said his trip aimed to counter ''Israeli propaganda'' about
why the Camp David summit failed. When the two-week meeting ended Tuesday,
Israel blamed the Palestinians for lacking the flexibility to forge a historic
peace deal at the U.S.-mediated summit.

9 Killed in Brazil Train Crash

   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- A fast-moving train barreled down a hill without
braking and rammed another train that was stopped to board commuters, killing
nine and injuring 115, authorities said Saturday. The two trains collided during
Friday morning rush hour at a station in Perus, 40 miles northwest of San Paulo,
said the Sao Paulo Metropolitan Train Company. The company said a train carrying
only an engineer and his assistant failed to brake as it roared downhill,
gathering speed until it entered the station and struck the commuter train,
which was parked at a platform. The assistant engineer of the runaway train was
among those killed, the company said.

Fujimori Says He Rebuffed Plan

   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- President Alberto Fujimori accused his opponents Saturday
of plotting to set fire to Congress during clashes that marred his inauguration,
delivering his most blistering attack in years on Peru's opposition. The visibly
angry Fujimori, comparing his opponents to leftist terrorists, lay the blame on
them for rioting Friday that left six people dead and several downtown buildings
in flames during demonstrations by tens of thousands of Peruvians against his
inauguration. Addressing the military high command, he said the demonstrators
had conceived a ''totally delirious plan to burn the Congress building so that
the president-elect could not be sworn in.''

Russia's Demographic Decline Grows
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's population, currently around 145 million, is
shriveling at a tempo unheard of in the modern era. Over the past six years, Dr.
Irina Budnikova has examined thousands of Russian women who want to give birth
but can't -- women who have had six miscarriages, women whose ovaries atrophied
before they turned 30, women so anemic that pregnancy made them faint daily.
These problems, she says, combined with Russia's still staggering abortion rate,
are helping drive Russia's demographic decline. At the current rate of decrease,
demographers predict the world's largest country will have a population smaller
than Japan's -- 125 million -- within 20 years.

packed the main Lutheran church Saturday to remember the dead. ''Why this

in six innings. He struck out five and walked five.

Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle, was first sung in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   In 1844, the New York Yacht Club was founded.
</P>
<P>
   In 1864, during the Civil War, Union forces tried to take
Petersburg, Va., by exploding a mine under Confederate defense
lines; the attack failed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1932, the Summer Olympic Games opened in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942, President Franklin Roosevelt signed a bill creating a
women's auxiliary agency in the Navy known as Women Accepted for
Volunteer Emergency Service, WAVES for short.
</P>
<P>
   In 1945, during World War II, the USS Indianapolis was torpedoed
by a Japanese submarine; only 316 out of 1,196 men survived the
sinking in shark-infested waters.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, President Lyndon Johnson signed into law the Medicare
bill, which went into effect the following year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, representatives of 35 countries convened in Finland for
a conference on security and human rights that resulted in the
Helsinki accords.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, the Israeli Knesset passed a law reaffirming all of

</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago: British Conservative Party lawmaker Ian Gow was

</P>
<P>
   Five years ago: Russia and Chechen rebels signed an agreement
calling for a gradual withdrawal of Russian troops and the
disarmament of rebel fighters.
</P>
<P>
   One year ago: Republicans pushed their $792 billion tax cut
through the Senate. Linda Tripp, whose secretly recorded phone
conversations with Monica Lewinsky led to the impeachment of
President Clinton, was charged in Maryland with illegal wiretapping
(prosecutors later dropped the charges). The leaders of some 40
nations gathered in Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina, pledging to push
economic and democratic reforms for the war-torn Balkans.

<HEADLINE> Marlins' Cliff Floyd Goes on DL  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A day after placing starting shortstop Alex
Gonzalez went on the disabled list, the Florida Marlins lost left
fielder Cliff Floyd for at least a month.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd, who has been hobbled by a sore left knee since June, had
surgery Saturday to repair a torn medial meniscus.
</P>
<P>
   The injury-prone 27-year-old was batting .287 with 19 home runs
and 67 RBIs. Floyd, who also had 19 steals and 21 doubles in 95
games, is expected to return in 4-6 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's put up great numbers and was on track for 30 homers and
30 stolen bases,'' Marlins manager John Boles said. ''It's a shame,
but the great news is, he'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida purchased the contract of shortstop Mendy Lopez from
Triple-A Calgary. Lopez was hitting .301 with three homers, 15 RBIs
and 11 doubles in 29 games at Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd aggravated the knee while running out a double in Friday's
game against Arizona. He stayed in the game until the eighth
inning, when he was lifted for a pinch-runner.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been playing below 100 percent all season,'' Boles said.
''These last two injuries, losing our shortstop and left fielder,
we're definitely facing adversity. Now everybody has to elevate
their game. There's no sense hanging our heads.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd broke his left wrist in 1995, battled hamstring problems
during the Marlins' 1997 World Series championship season and
served two stints on the DL last season because of a sprained left
knee, which also required surgery.

<HEADLINE> Refugees From Bosnia Demonstrate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUZLA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- More than 5,000 Muslim refugees
from eastern Bosnia demonstrated Saturday, demanding to be allowed
to return to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees, who have been living in Tuzla, threatened to march
on the capital Sarajevo or return to their homes in Srebrenica and
make ''Bosnia shake again,'' if their demands are not met.
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton Peace Agreement, which ended the 3&AMP;frac12;-year war in 1995,
divided Bosnia into two parts, one controlled by the Muslims and
Croats and the other by the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement ordered the return of all refugees. But
implementation of the pact has been slow, particularly in the Serb
part, where Serb nationalists prefer to keep out the pre-war
population to maintain an all-Serb area.
</P>
<P>
   ''For five years we don't know where to go or what to do.
Enough,'' said Hakija Mehovic, a refugee from Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
   ''We give the government and the foreigners here 15 days time
and then we will go to Sarajevo and block it entirely because we
can't live like normal people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The foreigners Mehovic referred to are with the international
organizations that have been here since the war ended to help the
more than 1 million people displaced during the conflict return to
their homes. There has been little progress.
</P>
<P>
   Mehovic said there cannot be peace in Bosnia until everyone
returns to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will go to Srebrenica ourselves, but when we do -- Bosnia
will shake again,'' he warned.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the return of refugees has picked up compared to
previous years, but last week's Serb attack on Muslim returnees and
their property in the eastern Bosnian town of Janja was a major
setback.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs in Janja threw stones and bombs at Muslim houses for two
days, protesting their return. Some of the attacked returnees
retaliated and several people were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Fadil Banjanovic, an activist for refugee return to eastern
Bosnia, said the refugees feel like guinea pigs in an experiment of
how long one can endure.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody betrayed us, we're sick of declarations while they
(Serbs) are looting and burning our houses,'' he said. ''We too
will now practice the policy of force.''

<HEADLINE> Pak, Redman Share Eagle LPGA Lead  </HEADLINE>
By RUSTY MILLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOWLAND, Ohio (AP) -- Helen Alfredsson had three-putt bogeys on
the final two holes, opening the door for Se Ri Pak and Michele
Redman to share the lead through Saturday's second round of the
Giant Eagle LPGA Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Pak started the day tied for the lead with Alfredsson after both
had 7-under-par 65s in the opening round. Pak's second-round 69
left her 10-under at 134.
</P>
<P>
   Pak, chasing her ninth career victory, won the Giant Eagle two
years ago when Dottie Pepper missed a short putt on the final hole
that would have forced a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   An Ohio native followed around the course by her parents, Redman
shot a 68. She is seeking her second career victory and first in
three years.
</P>
<P>
   Alfredsson led by a shot going to the 17th hole, but her putter
failed her down the stretch, and she carded a 70 to trail by a
stroke after 36 of 54 holes.
</P>
<P>
   Her 45-foot birdie putt was off the mark by 5 feet and she
missed the putt coming back. On the 18th green, she rolled a
30-foot birdie putt past the hole and then failed to make the
4-foot par putt.
</P>
<P>
   The Swede has three-putted the last hole for bogeys in each
round.
</P>
<P>
   Playing in the same group, Pak and Alfredsson traded or shared
the lead for most of the day before Alfredsson overtook Pak with a
two-shot swing at No. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead by a stroke, Pak hooked her drive at the par-4 hole and
her ball came to rest in the crease between two pieces of fresh sod
a few feet left of the cart path and about 15 yards from the
fairway.
</P>
<P>
   An official ruled that Pak's ball was in ground under repair and
she was permitted to take a free drop. The Korean then hit a punch
shot through the green and failed to get up and down to save par.
</P>
<P>
   Moments earlier, Alfredsson yelled at herself in frustration as
she bladed her 7-iron approach on the same hole. But her low liner
took a big hop just in front of the green and rolled to within 6
feet of the cup. The birdie putt, coupled with Pak's bogey, put her
ahead by a shot before she ran into trouble on the last two holes.
</P>
<P>
   Redman pulled into a share of the lead when she holed a 45-foot
birdie putt on the 17th hole.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Hurst's 69 left her tied with Alfredsson.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Philo had her second 68 in a row and was at 8-under along
with Scotland's Janice Moodie. Powered by an eagle on the par-5
third hole, Moodie had a 65.
</P>
<P>
   Tammie Green, an Ohioan who won the Giant Eagle in 1994 and
again in 1997, started the day tied for 90th after a first-round
74. Helped by good-luck charms provided by a pair of course
marshals, she put together a 64 to rocket into a tie for seventh
place at 6-under.
</P>
<P>
   Her 64 matched the tournament record shared by four players --
including Green in the opening round in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The players were allowed to lift, clean and place the balls
because of wet conditions on the course, which has been completely
redesigned and reconstructed in the past 10 months.
</P>
<P>
   Play was suspended for 1 hour, 17 minutes after a thunderstorm
pounded the course just before the leaders were scheduled to tee
off.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Jackie Gallagher-Smith followed a 74 with a
68 and was at 142.
</P>
<P>
   Among those missing the cut was Nancy Lopez, who won the first
Giant Eagle in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Bush Previews Convention Themes  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- George W. Bush previewed themes for his
GOP convention as he campaigned in three swing-state battlegrounds
Saturday. He said he was wary of favorable polls, cautioning that
he's seen ''numbers crumble'' before.
</P>
<P>
   With the convention to begin in Philadelphia on Monday, the
Texas governor pressed eastward on a campaign tour of states that
voted Democratic in 1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''That day is over. We're going to carry Kentucky,'' he told a
cheering crowd standing in rain outside the Louisville Slugger
Museum, with its trademark six-story-high baseball bat.
</P>
<P>
   He began the day in Joplin, Mo., traveled through Kentucky and
ended it with a bus trip to Cincinnati for an outdoor rally in a
park on a hill overlooking the city.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Bush talked to reporters about expectations for
next week.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the things is to make the convention interesting so
that people pay attention to it,'' he said. He promised ''real-life
stories that reinforce our message.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Republicans would emphasize a ''different approach''
from the current administration. ''We're going to bring civility to
Washington, D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that ''walking out on that stage on Thursday'' to accept
the nomination would be the most magic moment of the convention for
him and that he was glad his family would share the moment. He had
particularly fond words for his parents -- his father, the former
president, and mother Barbara Bush. ''I love them a lot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's wife, Laura, is to give a speech to the convention on
Monday night, and his parents will be there during a salute to
former GOP presidents on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   GOP aides raised the possibility that all members of the Bush
clan would join the nominee on stage at the conclusion on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush reacted cautiously to polls showing him to be expanding his
lead over Al Gore -- to as much as 16 points in a CNN-Time Magazine
poll -- since Dick Cheney joined the Republican ticket on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not overconfident,'' he said. ''You know why? I've seen
firsthand defeat. I know what can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I've seen poll numbers crumble,'' said Bush, whose father lost
the 1992 election despite approval ratings that had soared during
the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about any role his father might have played in choosing
Cheney or making other decisions, Bush said, ''This man is not a
political consultant. He is a father and I love and respect him and
the advice I get from him is the advice a dad would give a son.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Time magazine, Bush said he is confident
enough to surround himself with smart people as advisers, and would
do so in the White House. ''I'm confident of my intellect,'' he
said. ''I wouldn't be running if I wasn't. My job will not be to
out-think everybody in my administration.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said advisers ''don't decide for me,'' and he will
overrule them when he thinks it's right.
</P>
<P>
   He also said in the interview that his family name ''cuts both
ways'' in campaigning. ''Some folks will say 'there's George and
Barbara's son. He must be interesting, let me listen.' Others say
'he's not done anything in his life, just running on his daddy's
name.' It's a mixed blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, who had campaigned with Bush on Friday, broke off on
Saturday to keep his own schedule. He's due in Philadelphia for a
pre-convention rally on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   At the Louisville rally, Bush praised him as ''a man who'd make
you proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in an interview with Fox News taped on Saturday for
airing on Sunday, Cheney said he was ''generally one of those
people who thinks Bill Clinton has been an enormous embarrassment
to the country.'' A partial transcript was made available by Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is a tragic figure in a way. Obviously very bright. He's
got a very impressive set of basic interpersonal political skills
of a standard politician in good stead, but obviously has
fundamental flaws,'' Cheney told Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told reporters that Cheney was ''a little more laid back''
than he was. ''But it's a style that I'm very comfortable with.''
</P>
<P>
   In his campaign appearances on Saturday, Bush emphasized upbeat
themes expected to be sounded in his convention speech.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the messages I want to share with America is love your
children all the time,'' he told a rally in an airport hangar in
Owensboro.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to just hold the job'' of president, he said. ''I
want to lead Americans in new directions.''
</P>
<P>
   At the rainy Louisville rally, a handful of protesters on the
fringe were chanting for Gore and holding Gore signs. One held a
sign that said of Bush, ''Daddy's money...Empty suit.''

<HEADLINE> Couple Files Suit Vs. Burger Chain  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEAVERTON, Ore. (AP) -- A Beaverton couple has filed a $7 million
federal lawsuit against a popular hamburger chain, accusing some
local employees of spiking their burger with hair, soap, staples
and spit.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love Jack in the Box and it just didn't look right,'' said
one of the plaintiffs, 24-year-old Dustin Harrington.
</P>
<P>
   After taking a bite of the burger earlier this year and seeing
what was inside, ''then I was like 'Oh, my God.' I couldn't believe
it,'' Harrington said.
</P>
<P>
   He and Colleen Murphy also contend in their lawsuit that a
Latino employee at the Jack in the Box restaurant in neighboring
Hillsboro made a racist comment about Harrington.
</P>
<P>
   A Jack in the Box spokesman said the company is investigating.
He said employees at the Hillsboro location have been interviewed
and the burger was tested.
</P>
<P>
   But he would not reveal what the San Diego-based company has
learned.
</P>
<P>
   ''From the time of the allegation, we've been doing a thorough
investigation,'' said spokesman Brian Luscomb.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can say Jack In The Box has the most complete food safety
system in the industry. The USDA refers to our system as the model
for the industry.''

<HEADLINE> New Fenway Park Given Initial OK  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE LeBLANC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Massachusetts lawmakers gave initial approval
Saturday to a financing plan for a $664 million, 44,000-seat
stadium for the Boston Red Sox, to be built adjacent to Fenway
Park.
</P>
<P>
   The versions of the bill approved by the Massachusetts House and
Senate were slightly different and await final approval from
legislators.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved a series of amendments, including more
public funds for arts and cultural institutions. The House approved
a similar amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate also approved amendments allowing the state to spend
more money on so-called ''urban renewal'' projects in local cities
and towns and setting aside $7 million for a minor league ballpark
in Pittsfield.
</P>
<P>
   The bill requires the state to spend $100 million on road and
subway improvements near the ballpark. The plan also requires the
city of Boston to spend $140 million cleaning up the proposed park
site and $72 million to build a new parking garage.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved the bill 29-9 and the House 126-27.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will start working immediately with the city, our business
leaders, and our bankers to determine how best to move forward,''
Red Sox chief executive officer John Harrington said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if it is passed by the Legislature and signed by Gov. Paul
Cellucci, the bill still must be approved by nine of the 13 members
of the Boston City Council. Opponents of the bill said seven
council members oppose the plan -- enough to defeat it.

<HEADLINE> GOP Revises Education Draft  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A day after George W. Bush's main education
principles were removed from a draft of the Republican platform by
a panel of delegates, the full platform committee put them back
Saturday, but in somewhat revised form.
</P>
<P>
   References to federal actions in education were played down a
bit to make the language more acceptable to conservatives who
object to a strong role for Washington.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a reference to the government ''demanding results''
was left out in the statement of core principles.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of doubling charter schools, the revised principles
speak only of increasing them.
</P>
<P>
   A reference to helping all children learn to read, ''especially
disadvantaged youngsters,'' was changed to strike the reference to
the disadvantaged. And a plug for phonics, a favored teaching
method of some traditionalists, was added.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the new version does not contradict Bush's plans. Platforms
contain principles adopted by parties, not presidential candidates,
who are free to campaign on whatever policies they wish.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the text of the original set of principles, patterned
most closely on Bush's agenda, and then the text that was
eventually approved by the committee:
</P>
<P>
   BEFORE:
</P>
<P>
   ''For dramatic and swift improvement, we endorse the principles
of Governor Bush's education reforms:
</P>
<P>
   -- Assist states in closing the achievement gap by requiring
federally funded programs to boost student achievement -- or be
replaced.
</P>
<P>
   -- Empower low-income families to escape persistently failing
schools by allowing federal dollars to follow their children to the
school of their choice through opportunity scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   -- Improve early learning by reforming the Head Start program and
by facilitating state initiatives to ensure that all children,
especially disadvantaged youngsters, learn to read.
</P>
<P>
   -- Raise academic standards through local control and
accountability, turning scores of federal programs into five
flexible grants, and demanding results by conditioning assistance
on real, measured progress.
</P>
<P>
   -- Encourage states to arm parents with information on their
child's school through report cards that provide data on academic
performance in schools.
</P>
<P>
   -- Expand choice and encourage competition by doubling the number
of charter schools and greatly expanding Education Savings
Accounts, for use from kindergarten through college.
</P>
<P>
   -- Help states ensure school safety, not just by letting kids in
dangerous schools transfer to schools that are safe havens for
learning, but also through Project Sentry: forceful prosecution of
youths who carry or use guns -- and of the adults who provide
them.''
</P>
<P>
   AFTER:
</P>
<P>
   ''For dramatic and swift improvement, we endorse the principles
of Governor Bush's education reforms, which will:
</P>
<P>
   -- Raise academic standards through increased local control and
accountability to parents, shrinking a multitude of federal
programs into five flexible grants in exchange for real, measured
progress in student achievement.
</P>
<P>
   -- Assist states in closing the achievement gap and empower needy
families to escape persistently failing schools by allowing federal
dollars to follow their children to the school of their choice.
</P>
<P>
   -- Expand parental choice and encourage competition by providing
parents with information on their child's school, increasing the
number of charter schools, and expanding education savings accounts
for use from kindergarten through college.
</P>
<P>
   -- Help states ensure school safety, by letting children in
dangerous schools transfer to schools that are safe for learning
and by forcefully prosecuting youths who carry or use guns and the
adults who provide them.
</P>
<P>
   -- Ensure that all children learn to read by reforming Head Start
and by facilitating State reading initiatives that focus on
scientifically based reading research, including phonics.''

<HEADLINE> New Jersey delegates stuck in Cherry Hill hotel  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHERRY HILL, N.J. (AP) - You pop a thousand dollars for a room
and admission to events, and for all that money you end up on Route
70 in Cherry Hill at a hotel jammed between a highway interchange
and an endless array of strip malls.
</P>
<P>
   Could this be what New Jersey delegates had in mind for their
fabulous summer experience at the Republican National Convention in
Philadelphia?
</P>
<P>
   ''First off, I was disappointed they didn't choose New
Orleans,'' said Monmouth County delegate Sam Thompson, a state
Assemblyman. ''Then secondly, when they chose Philadelphia and I
found out we were in Cherry Hill, I said you know I might as well
take the train from Old Bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   But Thompson made his complaint mildly during the kickoff
reception with a pile of nachos on his plate and a big smile on his
face. ''As the week gets underway, we will not realize where we are
at, we will be having so much fun,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Bassano, an alternate delegate and state senator from Union
Township, said, ''I would have rather been in the city. The closer
you are to the convention center, the more you feel you are into
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But was he disappointed? ''Oh no, no, no. We're going to go
there tonight for dinner,'' Bassano said.
</P>
<P>
   With the City of Brotherly Love unable to find neighborly
accommodations for the thousands of Republican delegates,
alternates, party officials, politicians and VIP guests from the 50
states, delegations from 14 states and two territories were housed
outside the city - three in the Philadelphia suburbs, four in
Wilmington, Del., and nine in Camden and Burlington counties.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri, Maine, South Dakota and Puerto Rico join the New
Jersey delegation in Cherry Hill at other hotels; Iowa, Utah and
West Virginia are in Mount Laurel; and Kentucky is at the Hampton
Inn in Voorhees.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyist and alternate delegate Jose Sosa, who lives a few miles
away in Westampton, said, ''I could have commuted. I would have
preferred to be at the heart of the convention, but you could argue
that New Jersey is an extension of the convention.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a very easy commute for us so at the end of the day when
people get used to being where they are, we will almost feel like
we are a part of Philadelphia,'' Sosa said.
</P>
<P>
   Gwendelyn Sanford of Essex County said she was taken aback when
she learned last month she would be busing to the convention from
Cherry Hill. ''I am a black Republican. I have to have a sense of
humor.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If I had my druthers, I would have preferred spending my time
in the City of Brotherly Love,'' Sanford said, but then added, ''To
be anywhere but Montclair, New Jersey, is a vacation for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey delegation is at the well-appointed Cherry Hill
Hilton, where the delegates made the best of it quickly at a
reception in a pool-side tent, munching on steamboat roasts, smoked
salmon by the square yard, mountains of shrimp and crab claws, and
artistic arrays of sliced fruit.
</P>
<P>
   The master of ceremonies at the kickoff, state GOP chairman
Garabed Haytaian, welcomed all heartily and opened his remarks with
some encouragement: ''I will tell you, we are very close.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the New Jersey delegation's slogan, printed on buttons, had
a sense of humor about it. The button bears the famous painting of
Gen. Washington crossing the Delaware River with the words,
''Crossing the Delaware for another George.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the band at the reception did play Jamaican steel-drum
music and many did wear painfully loud Hawaiian shirts, all
suggesting at least a fantasy of being someplace other than here.
</P>
<P>
   ''There have been some comments like that among the
delegations,'' said the senior delegate of the crowd, former Gov.
Thomas Kean, who attended his first convention in Philadelphia 52
years ago as a 13-year-old page to watch Thomas Dewey win the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ''Personally, I think for the New Jersey delegation to stay in
New Jersey is fine,'' Kean said. Gov. Christie Whitman seconded his
assessment, saying it might have seemed odd for New Jersey leaders
not to be housed in their home state.

<HEADLINE> Posters Given Out Without Wickman  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- While Bob Wickman is gone, the Milwaukee
Brewers weren't about to be stuck with 30,000 posters of their
former closer.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Wickman All-Star Poster Night went on as scheduled Saturday
night at County Stadium, a day after the Brewers dealt their
All-Star to Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would only hope that future poster promotions don't scare
away our players when we go to them with the idea early in the
season,'' Brewers spokesman Laurel Prieb said.
</P>
<P>
   Wickman, the team's closer for more than three seasons, was
traded with pitchers Steve Woodard and Jason Bere for slugger
Richie Sexson and pitchers Paul Rigdon and Kane Davis plus a player
to be named.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a little late to get a poster of him,'' said Helen
Roselli, an elderly fan from Germantown, a Milwaukee suburb. ''But
I'm happy to get one. He did a good job when he was here. He's a
native of Wisconsin, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter, Kathleen DeWall, also of Germantown, quickly
added, ''That's why it's a shame he's leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   Wickman's former teammates were happy to see the team continue
with the promotion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Absolutely,'' outfielder Geoff Jenkins said. ''I'm going to
put one in my locker just to remember him.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a nice collector's item now,'' shortstop Mark Loretta
said.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever David Weathers, one of Wickman's best friends on the
team, had a plan for his poster.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was funny timing,'' he said. ''I'm going to get one and ask
him to autograph it for me.''

<HEADLINE> Cardinals Get Timlin From Orioles  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- The St. Louis Cardinals fortified their bullpen
Saturday by obtaining right-hander Mike Timlin from the Baltimore
Orioles for first baseman Chris Richard and minor league pitcher
Mark Nussbeck.
</P>
<P>
   Timlin, 34, had served as the Orioles' closer since joining the
team as a free agent after the 1998 season. He's 4-for-4 in save
opportunities since July 7 and has 11 saves in 15 chances this
year.
</P>
<P>
   He likely will serve as a setup man for David Veres, who has 18
saves.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously it's a good thing to be going from fourth place to
first place,'' Timlin said. ''St. Louis is one of the places I
almost went before I signed here.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Orioles, the trade emphasized the team's sudden
willingness to unload veterans for youth. Baltimore traded
34-year-old shortstop Mike Bordick to the New York Mets on Friday
for shortstop Melvin Mora and three minor leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   Timlin, 2-3 with a 4.89 ERA in 37 relief appearances, is making
$4 million in the second season of a $16 million, four-year
contract that calls for him to get $4 million next year and $5
million in 2002. As part of the deal, Baltimore will pay part of
the remainder of the contract.
</P>
<P>
   ''I expect Mike to have great success with St. Louis,'' said Syd
Thrift, the Orioles vice president of player personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Timlin experienced mixed success in Baltimore. He blew eight
save chances in the first half last year before going 18-for-19 in
the second half. This season, the fans booed him after an
ineffective stretch that temporarily cost him the role as the
Orioles' lone closer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I took a lot of ragging, but being a reliever, you're going to
get that. You deal with it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to join the Cardinals in New York on Sunday for their
game against the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll get to say hi to Mr. Bordick, then we'll just take it
from there,'' Timlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard, 26, was recalled by St. Louis on July 17. He made his
major league debut that night and became the 80th player ever to
homer in his first at bat when he connected off Minnesota's Mike
Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   With first baseman Will Clark in the final year of his contract
and backup Jeff Conine turning 35 next year, Thrift figured Richard
might have a place on the team in the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw there was a need for the team in the future. He was a
top priority for us,'' Thrift said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard was 2-for-16 in six games with the Cardinals after
batting .277 with 24 doubles, 16 home runs and 75 RBI in 95 games
for Triple-A Memphis. He went 2-for-3 with an RBI and a run scored
in the Triple-A All-Star game on July 12.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he batted a combined .298 with 30 home runs and 98
RBIs between Double-A Arkansas and Triple-A Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   Nussbeck, 26, was 9-4 with a 3.96 ERA in 21 starts for Triple-A
Memphis. He allowed 127 hits in 125 innings, walking 44 and
striking out 76.
</P>
<P>
   Nussbeck was the Cardinals' 29th-round selection in the 1996
amateur draft. He was assigned to Triple-A Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a starting pitcher, so we're happy with that
transaction,'' Thrift said.

<HEADLINE> US Soldier in Kosovo Pleads Guilty  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE BOEHMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- A U.S. soldier scheduled to stand
trial next week for the killing of an ethnic Albanian girl in
Kosovo has pleaded guilty, a military spokeswoman said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Staff Sgt. Frank J. Ronghi, 36, entered the plea late Friday at
the request of his defense lawyer and will be sentenced Monday, the
day his trial was to start, said Hilda Patton, a spokeswoman for
the U.S. Army's 5th Corps.
</P>
<P>
   He pleaded guilty to charges of murder, forcible sodomy and
three counts of indecent acts with a child, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors, without explanation, dropped two other charges,
one of rape and another of sodomy murder -- a single charge distinct
from the murder and forcible sodomy charges -- during the two-hour
session led by a U.S. Army judge, Col. Kenneth Clavenger.
</P>
<P>
   Ronghi faces a possible sentence of life in prison, or life
without the possibility of parole, Patton said.
</P>
<P>
   He also is expected to face a reduction in rank to private,
forfeiture of all pay and allowances and a dishonorable discharge,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ronghi was charged with killing Merita Shabiu on Jan. 13 in the
basement of an apartment building and burying her body in the snow
near the town of Vitina. He was arrested just days after the
killing.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Niles, Ohio, Ronghi was a weapons squad leader
assigned to the 3rd Battalion, 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment at
Fort Bragg, N.C., and was serving with U.S. peacekeeping forces at
the time of the killing.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's death raised tensions between peacekeeping troops in
Kosovo and ethnic Albanians. Ethnic Albanians in the province
already had been critical of other alleged mistreatment, including
inappropriate body searches of women since the 50,000-person
NATO-led force entered Kosovo in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Ronghi had been held since January at the U.S. Army's
Confinement in Mannheim. He is currently confined in Wuerzburg, 60
miles west of Frankfurt, where he will be sentenced. U.S. military
personnel convicted of murder normally serve their sentences in Ft.
Leavenworth, Kan., the military's top high-security prison.

<HEADLINE> Holocaust survivor: ''Let them keep the money''  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - For Holocaust survivors like Henry Joseph,
a $1.25 billion settlement that will have Swiss banks pay men like
him for crimes committed during World War II is an insult.
</P>
<P>
   For others, the $2,000 to $7,000 they will receive could mean
necessary things like medical care. Or it could help educate others
about the 20th century's darkest time.
</P>
<P>
   The question will be asked and asked again as Holocaust
survivors weigh the benefits of a financial award against the idea
of what they say is buying Germany and Switzerland a clean
conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, a federal judge approved a settlement in
which Swiss banks will pay $1.25 billion that had been deposited by
Holocaust victims and never repaid. Also this month, Germany agreed
to create a $5 billion foundation to compensate people forced to
work for Hitler's war machine.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph lost his mother, sister and more than 30 other family
members in the Holocaust, had his family business gutted by fire,
his house ransacked and spent four years in forced labor.
</P>
<P>
   He wants nothing to do with the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ''They want to get away with nickels and dimes and they want a
complete release for all the crimes they committed,'' said Joseph
of suburban Kenmore. ''It's not up to us to forgive them for all
the people they killed. Let them keep the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Eisen lost six of eight members of his immediate family in
the Holocaust and was in seven concentration camps. He turned down
reparation payments decades ago but will reluctantly accept the
settlement to provide additional care for his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ''My wife is so important to me,'' said Eisen, an 80-year-old
retired tailor. ''But they can't buy me back and they can't pay me
off. They killed my whole family and my wife's family. They can
never pay me back for my suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Anything that touches on the horrors of those times evokes
agony,'' said Rabbi Michael Feshbach of Temple Beth Am in Amherst.
''I believe there may be a perception that this is about money.
This is not about money. This is about justice, and there is no
half-life on justice.''

GOP Revises Education Draft
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A day after George W. Bush's main education principles
were removed from a draft of the Republican platform by a panel of delegates,
the full platform committee put them back today, but in somewhat revised form.
References to federal actions in education were played down a bit to make the
language more acceptable to conservatives who object to a strong role for
Washington. Instead of doubling charter schools, the revised principles speak
only of increasing them.

Swedish colonists to what is now Wilmington. Several of the more than 2,000
delegates attending the convention had arrived earlier in the week, but the bulk
began arriving this afternoon or planned to arrive tomorrow -- many by plane,

senior Cabinet councilor Jon Kum Jin, flew in on a commercial flight from

initiated a multi-country tour Saturday to drum up support for the Palestinians
in the Middle East peace process. Speaking before his departure at the airport
in the Gaza Strip, Arafat said his trip aimed to counter ''Israeli propaganda''
about why the Camp David summit failed. When the two-week meeting ended Tuesday,
Israel blamed the Palestinians for lacking the flexibility to forge a historic
peace deal at the U.S.-mediated summit.

9 Killed in Brazil Train Crash
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- A fast-moving train barreled down a hill without
braking and rammed another train that was stopped to board commuters, killing
nine and injuring 115, authorities said Saturday. The two trains collided during
Friday morning rush hour at a station in Perus, 40 miles northwest of San Paulo,
said the Sao Paulo Metropolitan Train Company. The company said a train carrying
only an engineer and his assistant failed to brake as it roared downhill,
gathering speed until it entered the station and struck the commuter train,
which was parked at a platform. The assistant engineer of the runaway train was
among those killed, the company said.

<HEADLINE> Party Votes To Remove Buchanan Name  </HEADLINE>
By KELLIE B. GORMLY
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Reform Party leaders voted unanimously Saturday to
remove Pat Buchanan's name from the party's presidential ballot
amid allegations of campaign fraud and disregard of party rules.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan was ''hijacking the party'' and thus had eliminated
himself as a legitimate candidate, Reform Party Secretary Jim
Mangia told colleagues at a meeting at an airport hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are a party that was created on the principles of reform --
integrity and accountability,'' Mangia said. ''It's astounding ...
these kinds of dirty tricks.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the 10 members on the party's executive committee
attended the meeting -- the majority of whom are supporters of party
founder Ross Perot. They discussed Buchanan for about two hours
before voting.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan spokesman Brian Doherty dismissed the effort as
frivolous and called the allegations ''false and outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They're just doing everything they can to obstruct us or
impede Buchanan's nomination,'' Doherty said Saturday before the
vote. ''They can't defeat us legitimately, so they go about it
trying to defeat us in other ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the committee's decision places Iowa physicist John
Hagelin as the party's presumed candidate for president, the vote
is not binding.
</P>
<P>
   Under party rules, the 164-member national committee will review
the executive committee's decision when it meets Aug. 8 in Long
Beach, Calif. By a two-thirds vote, members could reverse the
executive committee's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anything the executive committee does today is a publicity
stunt if anything,'' said Bob Belcher, the party's Alabama state
chairman and a professed neutral.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan left the Republican Party last October to seek the
Reform nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan and Hagelin are competing for the party nod in the
primary, which is a mail-in vote for party members and others who
have asked for a ballot. Hagelin and Perot loyalists accused the
Buchanan camp earlier this week of illegally padding the lists of
ballot recipients with people from his Republican donor lists.
</P>
<P>
   At stake was control of the party apparatus and $12.6 million in
federal election funds that go to the party's nominee.

<HEADLINE> Navy Exercises May Include Vieques  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- A Navy battleship group is planning
exercises next month likely to include the Puerto Rican island of
Vieques, where exercises last month prompted protests that led to
the arrest of more than 100 activists.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy published an environmental impact advisory in local
newspapers Saturday notifying citizens that the USS Harry Truman
Battle Group may have ship-to-land and air-to-land exercises with
inert artillery on Vieques between Aug. 3 to Aug. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Navy spokesman Lt. Jeff Gordon said Saturday that the advisory
did not mean the exercises were definitely to involve Vieques. ''If
and when it conducts exercises, the Navy will make the appropriate
announcements,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens were arrested in Vieques in June for trespassing on Navy
land during exercises by the USS George Washington Battle Group.
Protesters have been demanding the Navy remove its practice bombing
range on the tiny island off Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said the Truman group's exercises in the Caribbean in
August would include exercises on the high seas ''hundreds of miles
away from land.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he could not say yet if they would also involve Vieques,
he noted that the Navy's battleship groups have traditionally
conducted exercises on the island. The advisory printed in Spanish
in local newspapers said that the Navy has ''concluded that this
type of training only can be conducted on the island of Vieques.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the Washington group's exercises, the Navy had suspended
training on Vieques since April 1999, when a civilian security
guard was killed in an accidental bombing. Demonstrators occupied
the bombing range for a year after the accident, demanding the
training area be removed, until federal agents removed them
peacefully on May 4.
</P>
<P>
   The Truman group, with 15 ships, is based in Norfolk, Virginia.

<HEADLINE> Study Finds Baltimore Drug Problem  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- A federal study has found that Baltimore has
one of the most serious drug problems in the nation, and city
officials say they hope to use the information to seek more federal
aid to combat drug use and crime.
</P>
<P>
   The Drug Enforcement Administration's three-month study found
that Baltimore is a major market for South American heroin that is
''significantly'' purer than the national average.
</P>
<P>
   The DEA assessment was requested by Police Commissioner Edward
Norris this spring and delivered to department managers last week.
</P>
<P>
   Based on DEA intelligence and statistics, as well as independent
research, the assessment said Baltimore leads the nation in heroin
use and has one of the most severe crack cocaine epidemics in the
nation. The use of the designer club drug ecstasy has rapidly
increased, particularly among suburban users.
</P>
<P>
   ''It confirms a lot of the suspicions we had,'' Norris said.
''The drug problem is more serious than most major cities in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Norris said requests for aid might include asking for more DEA
agents in Baltimore, more money for drug-enforcement police and
more money for drug-treatment facilities for addicts.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore is estimated to have at least 60,000 drug addicts, or
about 10 percent of the population. Police say drugs are a factor
in eight of every 10 city homicides.
</P>
<P>
   With federal help and an agressive anti-drug strategy, Norris
and Mayor Martin O'Malley said, they believe the drug epidemic will
be under control in two to three years.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore also continues to lead the country in both heroin- and
cocaine-related hospital emergency room admissions, according to
the DEA.

   GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Safety Ray Austin was claimed by the
Green Bay Packers on Saturday, two days after Chicago waived him.
</P>
<P>
   Austin played in 15 games for the Bears last season, primarily
on special teams. He also had four tackles as a defensive back.
</P>
<P>
   He spent the first two years of his NFL career with the New York
Jets. The Packers, who are completely revamping their special

<HEADLINE> First Round Pick Simon Joins Eagles  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Corey Simon, Philadelphia's first-round draft
pick, joined the Eagles in Cleveland on Saturday, less than 24
hours after agreeing to a five-year, $11 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida State defensive tackle missed the first two weeks of
training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a long road,'' Simon said. ''I've been sitting back
and I've been anxious. But I am very, very, very happy to be here.
I missed my teammates, I miss the game. I've been away from it for
too long. I am just ready to get under way and have a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles' preseason begins Sunday against the Browns, and
Simon said he wants to play.
</P>
<P>
   Head coach Andy Reid has other ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's most likely that he won't play,'' Reid said. ''He's
trying to talk me into it, but he probably won't play. There is a
small window open but I don't think he can fit through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid is just happy to have his prized rookie in the fold.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are tremendously excited that both sides of the
negotiations that went on are happy with the results,'' Reid said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most important thing is that Corey is with us. He's
ripping and ready to play a little football. As a football coach, I
look forward to suiting him up and cutting him loose and letting
him do what he does best.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon, the sixth overall pick in April's draft, is being counted
on to improve an Eagles run defense that ranked 28th in the league
last season.

<HEADLINE> Germans Criticize Right-Wing  </HEADLINE>
By COLLEEN BARRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- German officials called for stronger measures
against right-wing extremism Saturday as police investigated
whether a bomb attack that injured Russian immigrants, six of them
Jews, was motivated by anti-Semitism or anti-foreign sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament's liaison to the Interior Ministry, Cornelie
Sonntag-Wolgast, promised to strengthen government efforts against
extremists, and especially internet sites that encourage hate.
</P>
<P>
   The parliament leader of the ruling Social Democrats, Peter
Struck, demanded that the right-wing scene be placed under tighter
surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   But even as politicians condemned the attack Thursday in
Duesseldorf that injured 10, the head of Germany's agency that
combats political threats said a lack of popular outrage against
neo-Nazis was also to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not being taken as seriously as one would like,'' Heinz
Fromm, the head of Germany's Office for the Protection of the
Constitution, told the Munich-based daily, Sueddeutsche Zeitung.
</P>
<P>
   That gives criminals ''the idea that they are committing these
crimes on behalf of many,'' Fromm said.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's attack, a bomb went off in a train station,
shooting shrapnel through a group of immigrants just getting out of
a German language class.
</P>
<P>
   Though there was still no evidence linking the bomb to
neo-Nazis, Germans expressed surprise that the attack took place in
western Germany -- not the former East Germany, where high
unemployment has fueled anti-foreign sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   One of the victims, a 28-year-old immigrant from Ukraine whose
wife also was seriously injured in the attack and miscarried,
remained in critical condition on Saturday, police spokesman Lothar
Sprick said. The wife's condition had stabilized, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Police also reported that another woman was slightly injured in
the attack, raising the number of victims to 10.
</P>
<P>
   Bomb experts were still trying to determine whether the bomb,
was set off by a timer, suggesting a random attack, or by remote
control, which might mean the victims were targeted.
</P>
<P>
   Sprick said investigators were following up 50 tips from
individuals, but none have so far yielded suspects or concrete
evidence the attack was a hate crime.
</P>
<P>
   One of the victims, a 29-year-old woman from Russia who was
injured in the hand, told the Duesseldorf Express that she did not
believe the group had been targeted.
</P>
<P>
   ''We never did anything to anyone. It must just be a horrible
coincidence,'' the woman, identified only as Nathalie R., said.
</P>
<P>
   She moved to nearby Duisburg six months ago, joining tens of
thousands of Jews from the former Soviet Union who have immigrated
to Germany under a post-Cold War policy. Their numbers have nearly
tripled Germany's Jewish population from 30,000 only five years ago
to 80,000 now.

<HEADLINE> 30 Stowaways Found in Truck Chase  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Police officers chased a truck for 60 miles after
it refused to stop for inspection in Dover port Saturday, and then
discovered it was hiding 30 stowaways inside, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Eight police cars were involved in the pursuit, after the truck
driver failed to stop for immigration inspectors after leaving a
ferry at the English Channel port of Dover.
</P>
<P>
   ''The chase lasted for an hour with the truck reaching speeds of
up to 50 mph,'' said a police spokesman. One officer was taken to
hospital with back injuries, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 30 men, described as Asian in appearance, were handed over
to immigration officials, police said. The driver was being
questioned by police.
</P>
<P>
   In June, 58 Chinese illegal immigrants were found dead in the
back of a truck at Dover. They had asphyxiated during a journey
from Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Britain announced new penalties in a crack
down on illegal immigration. Truck drivers caught carrying
stowaways can be fined $3,000 per person.

<HEADLINE> Mariners 6, Blue Jays 5, 13 Innings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Edgar Martinez singled home the winning run in
the 13th inning Saturday, giving the Seattle Mariners a 6-5 win
over the Toronto Blue Jays in the longest game in Safeco Field's
1-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Rickey Henderson singled leading off the inning against Roy
Halladay (4-7), Toronto's seventh pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   David Bell bunted and Henderson beat catcher Alberto Castillo's
throw to second, and Alex Rodriguez singled as Henderson, who
paused between second and third, didn't try to score.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez then then singled up the middle under the glove of
shortstop Alex Gonzalez, ending the longest of Safeco's 94 games
after 5 hours, 4 minutes. It was Seattle's first win in five
extra-inning games this season.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Tomko (5-3) gave up two hits in three innings. Joe Oliver
went 3-for-5 with a pair of doubles and a home run.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle had loaded the bases with one out in the 10th, but
Henderson struck out against Lance Painter and Bell flied out.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners tied the score at 5 in the sixth when Oliver hit an
RBI double and scored on Stan Javier's single. The teams nearly
brawled when John Frascatore hit Rodriguez in the left thigh.
</P>
<P>
   The two exchanged words and had to be restrained, but no punches
were thrown as both benches and bullpens came on the field. Toronto
batters have been hit a league-leading 46 times, including three
times in the series.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle ace Jamie Moyer didn't get a decision for the first time
in 18 games since last Sept. 8 against Toronto. Moyer, 11-3,
allowed five runs and seven hits in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto starter Frank Castillo gave up five runs and eight hits
in 5 1-3 innings, striking out seven.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver, starting in place of Dan Wilson, homered in the third
for a 1-0 lead, and Seattle got two more runs when left fielder
Shannon Stewart lost John Olerud's fly ball in the sun, and it hit
him in the left eye for a two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart has a bruise above the eye and probably will be able to
play Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Bautista hit an RBI grounder in the fourth, and Toronto
took a 4-3 lead in the fifth on a run-scoring single by Rob Ducey,
reacquired by Toronto on Wednesday from Philadelphia, and Craig
Grebeck's two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Greene's second homer of the season made it 5-3 in the
sixth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Both teams are 1-4 in extra innings. ... Olerud's
third-inning single stopped an 0-for-13 streak. ... Toronto's
Carlos Delgado doubled for the seventh consecutive game. He is
12-for-25 with 10 doubles during that stretch. ... Grebeck, making
his 37th start in 105 games, had his fifth straight two-hit game.

<HEADLINE> Groups Support Strike in Zimbabwe  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL HARTNACK
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- A white farmers group in Zimbabwe and
the main opposition party have thrown their support behind a
three-day national strike beginning Wednesday to protest violence
by government supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Since February, more than 1,600 white-owned farms have been
occupied by ruling party-backed militants in this southern African
nation. Labor leaders of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions
called the strike to protest the government's lack of action
against violence on white-owned farms.
</P>
<P>
   The Commercial Farmers Union that represents white farmers and
the opposition party Movement for Democratic Change said Saturday
they would join with labor in the protest.
</P>
<P>
   ''All farming operations except essential tasks should be
stopped for the three-day period,'' the farmers group said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The group also said more farms were being invaded and new
threats issued to owners to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Henwood, president of the farmers group, said a
delegation hoped to meet with President Robert Mugabe this weekend
to discuss the land invasions. ''We asked to see him, and we were
told he wants to see us,'' said Henwood.
</P>
<P>
   Henwood said a Commercial Farmers Union delegation Saturday held
talks with Mugabe's Central Intelligence Organization, accused in
the past by government critics of coordinating and assisting rural
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Minority whites own about a third of the productive land in the
country, and Mugabe has said land occupations are a justified
demonstration against unfair land distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Violence and intimidation by the farm squatters has disrupted
production of food and cash crops across Zimbabwe, hurting the
already ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
   White farmers in several areas have been halting production over
the past two weeks in protest at beatings and death threats from
the militant Liberation War Veterans' Association, which is behind
many of the occupations. The Commercial Farmers Union had until now
distanced itself from the stoppages.
</P>
<P>
   Information Minister Jonathan Moyo said white farmers were
manipulating labor leaders in a last-ditch attempt to stop Mugabe's
plan to redistribute 12 million acres of white owned land to black
Zimbabweans.
</P>
<P>
   However, Moyo said, Mugabe's commitment to redistribute the land
''is irreversible.''

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton blames Arafat for breakdown of peace talks  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton on Saturday blamed
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat for the breakdown of the Middle
East peace talks as her U.S. Senate opponent, Rick Lazio, accused
her of flip-flopping on moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel to
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, courting the Jewish vote in the Hamptons, noted that Mrs.
Clinton's call on Saturday to relocate the embassy from Tel Aviv
came just eight months after she told an Orthodox Jewish group that
she could not support an immediate move of the facility.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just don't think her remarks have credibility,'' Lazio told
reporters in an impromptu news conference outside a Long Island
diner. ''The real issue here is that she has said in the past that
she is not for placing the embassy in Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, for the first time in her U.S. Senate bid, Clinton
set a year-end deadline for the American Embassy to move to
Jerusalem. In December, in a meeting with the Union of Orthodox
Jewish Congregations of America, she declined to make a commitment
for an immediate relocation.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton campaign, rebutting the Lazio charge, produced a
July 2, 1999, letter from the first lady to the Orthodox Union in
which she advocated the U.S. Embassy's move to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Saturday, she discussed the failed Camp David meetings
aimed at a Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's clear that (Israeli) Prime Minister (Ehud) Barak came
committed to reaching a deal that would guarantee peace and
security for Israel and the entire region. And I'm sorry that
Chairman Arafat didn't show the same commitment,'' the first lady
said in an interview on WCBS-AM radio.
</P>
<P>
   She added: ''It's time that Chairman Arafat step forward and
conclusively demonstrate his willingness to forge a real, lasting
peace agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The 14-day Middle East summit ended earlier this week, with the
conflicting claims over Jerusalem as the main stumbling block to an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton seeks New York's critical Jewish vote, which
represents about 12 percent of the state's electorate, she appears
to be taking a page out of her husband's political book.
</P>
<P>
   She spoke the same day as President Clinton, in a front page
story in The New York Times, said the United States would consider
moving its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   His wife took a stronger position Saturday, declaring a
timetable for such a decision. ''I'd like to see that move be made
before the end of the year,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, speaking at the Hampton Synagogue in Westhampton Beach,
received applause from the congregation when he called for the
relocation of the embassy to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ''I support a united and undivided Jerusalem,'' Lazio said,
speaking at the same synagogue the first lady visited last week.
''And I have repeatedly called for and voted for placing the U.S.
embassy in the eternal city of Israel - Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, who spoke to a standing room only crowd of about 350
people, made the same comments on Jerusalem at a synagogue in East
Hampton later Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton campaign, which has taken strong pro-Israel
positions, has faced a number of flaps involving Jewish issues,
including the first lady's remark at a 1998 youth conference on
Middle East peace in Geneva: ''I think it will be in the long-term
interests of the Middle East for Palestine to be a state,'' and a
meeting last year between the first lady and Arafat's wife that
resulted in their much-publicized kiss on the cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, she again revisited a sore point that surfaced last
week, when she was accused in a book of once calling an aide in her
husband's campaign a ''Jew b------'
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone who's ever worked with me or knows me knew from the
beginning that it wasn't true,'' she told WCBS.
</P>
<P>
   Later Saturday, the president joined the first lady as she
addressed a fund-raising luncheon at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The couple tossed each other bouquets of praise, with the
president introducing his wife to several hundred Korean-Americans
who contributed a quarter of a million dollars to her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The president urged voters ''to support us,'' telling the
audience he had ''never known anyone who had the same combination
of intelligence and passion and knowledge and ability to get things
done for children, for families, for education, for health care, as
my wife does.''
</P>
<P>
   She responded: ''I am absolutely delighted to have the president
here today.''

   WASHINGTON (AP)-- Betty Lennox had a career-high 31 points, and

Mystics 87-85 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Lennox scored 17 points in the second half, and Smith made four
3-pointers to setting the WNBA record with 79 this season as the
Lynx (13-13) won their third straight.

<HEADLINE> Pirates 10, Padres 2  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Brian Giles went 5-for-5 with two run-scoring
doubles and Francisco Cordova came off the disabled list to pitch
five effective innings in the Pittsburgh Pirates' 10-2 romp over
the San Diego Padres on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Emil Brown and Warren Morris, who had three homers between them
coming in, each homered in the Pirates' second rout of the Padres
in as many nights. The Pirates had four multiple-run homers in
winning 16-5 Friday.
</P>
<P>
   With 16 hits Saturday, the Pirates have 30 hits in the two
games.
</P>
<P>
   Giles, whose average dropped from .342 in mid-June to below
.300, had RBI doubles in the first and third as the Pirates scored
in each of the first five innings against Padres starter Brian
Tollberg.
</P>
<P>
   Cordova, a weak hitter who was 3-for-31, helped himself with a
run-scoring single in the second. Brown hit his second homer of the
season and second in as many nights in the fourth, two batters
before Morris hit his third homer. It was his first homer since
June 6.
</P>
<P>
   The homers made it 5-1 before the Pirates scored three runs in
the fifth, two coming on two Padres errors on the same play.
Catcher Carlos Hernandez tried to pick Kevin Young off first, but
threw the ball into right field. Young kept on running and scored
as second baseman Bret Boone took the relay throw and also threw
wildly.
</P>
<P>
   Tollberg (2-1) lost for the first time in 21 starts this season
with the Padres and Triple-A Las Vegas, allowing eight runs, seven
earned, and 12 hits in four-plus innings. He was 6-0 at Las Vegas,
but had five successive no-decisions with San Diego since winning
his first two starts.
</P>
<P>
   Cordova (6-7) was sharp in his first start since July 3,
allowing three hits and a run over five innings. He threw strikes
on 46 of 63 pitches in his first victory since beating Montreal 8-3
on June 21.
</P>
<P>
   Cordova was rumored in trade talks before going on the disabled
list with a sore elbow for the second time this season after his
July 3 start. He was 1-3 with a 6.00 ERA in five starts prior to
returning to the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Morris has three homers after hitting 15 as a rookie. ...
The Pirates have outhomered their opponents 33-12 in the last 21
games. Pirates pitchers have allowed a major league-low 94 homers.
... The Pirates honored their 1960 World Series championship team
by wearing replicas of the vest-style uniforms worn by that team.
The 1960 batboy, Bobby Recker, was the honorary batboy. ... Giles
broke out of an 8-for-45 slump. ... Morris' homer was only his
second RBI in 26 games. ... The Padres are the only team in the
majors without a complete game. ... San Diego has scored three or
fewer runs in 13 of 24 games. ... The Padres have four errors in
the series after going without an error in 12 of their previous 18
games. ... The Padres are 1-4 in Pittsburgh this season. ... Giles
also was 5-for-5 against Houston on April 6.

<HEADLINE> Pa. Company Recalling Ground Beef  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Moyer Packing Co. of Souderton, Pa., is
recalling some 346,700 pounds of ground beef that may be
contaminated with potentially deadly E. coli bacteria, the
Agriculture Department said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The MOPAC brand ground beef was produced on July 11 and packaged
in 5- and 10-pound packages that bear the plant establishment
number 1311 and the date 07/11/00.
</P>
<P>
   They were distributed to wholesalers in Connecticut, Delaware,
Louisiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New York,
Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service said the meat may have
been reground and distributed and sold to retailers. The
contamination was discovered in routine testing.
</P>
<P>
   E. coli O157:H7 bacteria can cause bloody diarrhea and
dehydration and can be fatal in people with weakened immune
systems. USDA said it has received no reports of illnesses from
consumption of the ground beef.

<HEADLINE> Shock 75, Sting 72  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Wendy Palmer scored 21 points and
Astou Ndiaye-Diatta matched a career-high with 18 as the slumping
Detroit Shock beat the Charlotte Sting 75-72 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The victory moved Detroit (12-14), loser of four of its previous
five, one game ahead of Washington for the fourth and last playoff
position in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Rhonda Mapp had a career-high 25 points and 12 rebounds, and
Elena Tornikidou added 19 points for the Sting (7-19).
</P>
<P>
   Ndiaye-Diatta's impact wasn't entirely positive, though, as she
temporarily knocked teammate Dominique Canty out of the game with
an accidental elbow to the eye. Canty remained on the bench for
most of the second half with ice on the swollen eye.
</P>
<P>
   The Shock led by as many as 10 in the first half, but Charlotte
pulled within 35-30 at the intermission and as close as one early
in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit slowly moved its advantage back to 51-44 with 12 minutes
to play, then went on an 8-2 run to move the margin to 13.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany Travis scored the next six points to get the Sting
within 59-52, but Tornikidou's three-point play got the lead back
to 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte closed to 66-60, before Palmer hit four straight free
throws.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer finally hit two free throws with 27.3 seconds left to
extend Detroit's lead to 75-68. Mapp hit a 3-pointer as the Shock
fouled Charlotte Smith, who made the free throw to cut the deficit
to 75-72.
</P>
<P>
   After the Shock threw away the inbounds pass, Andrea Stinson's
tying 3-pointer bounced off the rim.

Party Votes To Remove Buchanan Name
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Reform Party leaders voted unanimously today to remove Pat
Buchanan's name from the party's presidential ballot amid allegations of
campaign fraud and disregard of party rules. Buchanan was ''hijacking the
party'' and thus had eliminated himself as a legitimate candidate, Reform Party
Secretary Jim Mangia told colleagues at a meeting at an airport hotel. Seven of
the 10 members on the party's executive committee attended the meeting -- the
majority of whom are supporters of party founder Ross Perot. Buchanan spokesman
Brian Doherty dismissed the effort as frivolous and called the allegations
''false and outrageous.''

they're just trying to steal some of Bush's spotlight, an age-old
counter-convention strategy. Indeed, the Democratic National Committee plans to
air its first negative Bush ad next week, spending about $3.5 million in 17
states to criticize his record as Texas governor, Democratic Party sources said
today.

The Navy published an environmental impact advisory in local newspapers today
notifying citizens that the USS Harry Truman Battle Group may have ship-to-land

24. Navy spokesman Lt. Jeff Gordon said today that the advisory did not mean the
exercises were definitely to involve Vieques.

Arafat Rebuts 'Israeli Propaganda'

   PARIS (AP) -- Disregarding a warning by President Clinton not to declare an
independent state and charging Israel with spreading lies, Yasser Arafat
initiated a multi-country tour Saturday to drum up support for the Palestinians
in the Middle East peace process. Speaking before his departure at the airport
in the Gaza Strip, Arafat said his trip aimed to counter ''Israeli propaganda''
about why the Camp David summit failed. When the two-week meeting ended Tuesday,
Israel blamed the Palestinians for lacking the flexibility to forge a historic
peace deal at the U.S.-mediated summit.

<HEADLINE> Indians, Orioles Split Twinbill  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Brady Anderson homered on the first pitch from
Cleveland newcomer Steve Woodard and the Baltimore Orioles went to
beat the Indians 4-0 Saturday night for a doubleheader split.
</P>
<P>
   In the day game, Manny Ramirez had six RBIs and two homers,
including a grand slam, and Jason Bere won in his Cleveland debut
as the retooled Indians coasted to a 14-3 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Bere (1-0), acquired along with Woodard on Friday in a
seven-player trade that sent Richie Sexson to Milwaukee, allowed
three runs and eight hits in seven innings, struck out six and
walked none. He was 6-7 with a 4.93 ERA in 20 starts for the
Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving at Camden Yards two hours before gametime, the
right-hander quickly put aside any butterflies that may have
followed the trade.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once I got over that, I found a comfort level,'' Bere said.
''And as you can see, these guys are pretty unbelievable -- the
plays they make plus the offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Jolbert Cabrera had a career-high five hits and Omar Vizquel had
a season-high four hits and two RBIs for Cleveland, which made
three trades and added five new players on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Woodard, David Segui made his Cleveland debut in
the second game and Wil Cordero began his second stint with the
Indians in left field. Segui went 2-for-4 and Cordero went hitless,
stranding four runners.
</P>
<P>
   Cordero grounded out with two on and two outs in the sixth and
hit a fly ball to the warning track in center in the same situation
in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Woodard (0-1) pitched well after Anderson drove his initial
pitch over the center-field wall. The right-hander allowed one run
and six hits in six innings, striking out four and walking one.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles made it 4-0 in the eighth. After Greg Myers singled
in a run and another scored on an errant pickoff throw by Cameron
Cairncross, Melvin Mora, obtained Friday in a trade with the New
York Mets, hit an RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Mercedes (6-4) gave up six hits and two walks in seven
innings as the Orioles snapped a five-game losing streak. One of
his two strikeouts came in the third, when he got Ramirez with
runners at second and third with two outs.
</P>
<P>
   Buddy Groom got two outs in the eighth, Mills retired Cordero to
end the inning and Mike Trombley worked the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles were without closer Mike Timlin, who between games
was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals for first baseman Chris
Richard and minor league pitcher Mark Nussbeck.
</P>
<P>
   In the opener, Cleveland took control with a five-run second
inning against Pat Rapp (6-7). Vizquel singled in a run and Ramirez
hit his 12th career slam.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Johnson hit a three-run homer in the bottom half, but
the Indians made it 6-3 in the third on Cabrera's RBI double.
Ramirez hit a two-run homer in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Cleveland stranded 12 in the second game. ... With a
sellout crowd of 47,715 at the opener, the Orioles increased their
attendance to 2,047,668. The crowd at the nightcap was announced as
47,355, but the stadium was actually less than half filled. The
game was a makeup of Friday night's rainout. ... The Indians
optioned RHP Tim Drew to Triple-A Buffalo and designated RHP Jaime
Navarro for assignment. ... RHP pitcher Jaret Wright, on the
disabled list with a sore shoulder, began a rehabilitation
assignment in Buffalo on Saturday. ... Johnson's homer was the
100th of his career. ... Baltimore RHP Ryan Kohlmeier pitched two
scoreless innings in the opener in his major league debut.

<HEADLINE> Former Seahawks QB Krieg Retires  </HEADLINE>
By JIM COUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHENEY, Wash. (AP) -- Dave Krieg wanted to play his 20th NFL
season, but the phone never rang.
</P>
<P>
   The three-time Pro Bowl quarterback with the Seattle Seahawks
made his retirement official Saturday. He picked Cheney, where the
Seahawks hold their training camp, to make his announcement because
it was the site of his first camp.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a hard decision to make, but when teams don't call
you after a year or two that's the way it goes,'' Krieg told a news
conference at Eastern Washington University.
</P>
<P>
   Second-year coach Mike Holmgren presented Krieg with a blue
Seahawks jersey with his name and old number, No. 17, on the back.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always wanted him to play for me, but he was way too
expensive every year,'' Holmgren said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Krieg: ''I wanted to play my 20th season a lot. To say 20
years in the NFL would have been great. As you know, with the
salary cap, they want younger players in there.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still think I can still play. I still think I can go out
there and do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Krieg ranks as the Seahawks' leader in pass attempts (3,576),
completions (2,096), yards (26,132), touchdowns (195),
interceptions (148) and rating (82.3). He helped the Seahawks get
to the playoffs three times -- 1983-84, '88.
</P>
<P>
   Krieg, 41, was released by the Tennessee Titans last July after
the team signed Neil O'Donnell to be Steve McNair's backup. Krieg
did not go to a training camp last season, but did not announce his
official retirement, hoping to catch on with another team and play
in a 20th NFL training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Krieg was with the Seahawks from 1980-91, Kansas City in '92-93,
Detroit in '94, Arizona in '95, Chicago in '96 and Tennessee in
'97-98. He now makes his home in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   During his 19-year career, he played in 213 games, starting 175
for the six teams. He joined the Seahawks as an undrafted free
agent from now-closed Milton College in Milton, Wis., and replaced
Jim Zorn as the starting quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Krieg also holds Seattle's single-season records for passing
attempts (532 in '85), touchdowns (32 in '84), completion
percentage (65.6 in '91) and passer rating (95.0 in '83). His 286
completions ('86) and 3,671 passing yards ('84) rank second to
Warren Moon's franchise mark of 313 passes for 3,678 yards in '97.
</P>
<P>
   Krieg was selected for the Pro Bowl in '84, '88-89.
</P>
<P>
   With the Seahawks, Krieg teamed with Hall of Fame receiver Steve
Largent for 364 completions, 5,817 yards and 46 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Krieg had four 400-yard passing games in Seattle and topped 300
yards 11 times.
</P>
<P>
   He ranks seventh in the NFL all-time in attempts with 5,309,

<HEADLINE> Thousands Pray at Iran Church  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DASHT-E-CHALRAN, Iran (AP) -- Thousands of Armenian Christians
from around the world prayed at an ancient church near this remote
hamlet in northwestern Iran on Saturday in an annual pilgrimage
honoring one of Jesus Christ's Twelve Apostles.
</P>
<P>
   About 10,000 Armenian Orthodox Christians, most from Iran but
many from as far away as the United States and Britain,
participated in a prayer ceremony led by Catholicos Aram
Keshishian, the spiritual leader of about 2 million Armenians
living in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Cyprus, Greece and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   The prayers were the climax of a pilgrimage made by thousands
every year to Qareh Kelisa, or Black Church in the local Azeri
language, a small stone church believed to date back to the late
6th or early 7th century A.D.
</P>
<P>
   Worshippers began arriving for the ceremony days ago,
transforming this quiet, distant plateau into a virtual town of
some 1,500 tents. Many of the pilgrims have spent their time
praying at the church, whose pointed, conical towers are distinctly
visible from a distance.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first year the Iranian government has granted
facilities such as electricity and relaxed its own Islamic rules to
accommodate the worshippers.
</P>
<P>
   Muslims were not allowed inside a huge area around the church
cordoned off with ropes. Inside, women mingled freely with men,
something not normally allowed in Iran. The women also were not
required to cover themselves from head to toe with the hijab, the
Islamic dress worn in public by Iranian women.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am very happy to be here and impressed by Iran's
hospitality,'' said Hagop Chakalian, who came to Iran from the
United States with a group of 20 other Americans, including his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just the fact that we, a group of Americans, are in Iran means
that things are changing in this country,'' said Chakalian, who is
from San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's social rules and two decades of strained relations with
the United States have been easing since the 1997 election of the
moderate President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   The Qareh Kelisa, 373 miles northwest of the Iranian capital,
Tehran, was originally built of black and white stone in honor of
St. Thaddaeus, also known in the New Testament as St. Jude.
</P>
<P>
   Legend says St. Thaddaeus and another apostle, Simon the Zealot,
were martyred in this part of present-day Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The church was extensively damaged in the 13th century, and
nearly all of it was rebuilt in the 17th century.

<HEADLINE> Magician Wins Breeders Crown Trot  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Magician beat Moni Maker, the
richest standardbred ever, by three lengths Saturday to win the $1
million Breeders Crown trot.
</P>
<P>
   Moni Maker would have gone over the $5 million mark in career
earnings with a victory. Instead, she started slowly from the nine
hole, ran into early traffic and had little left down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Magician slipped outside just after the three-quarter pole and
took the lead from Nikki Cole Cole at the top of the stretch. The
5-year-old gelded son of Royal Prestige pulled away for his eighth
win in 12 starts this year in 1:53 1-5.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't know if I could hang on for the win, but I was hoping
my horse had a lot left in his tank and he did,'' said Magician's
driver, David Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Moni Maker, who went off as the 1-2 favorite, will likely face
Magician again in her last appearance at the Meadowlands in next
Saturday's $500,000 Nat Ray pace. Moni Maker's lifetime earnings
grew to $4,918,631.
</P>
<P>
   ''Moni Maker was a little weak,'' trainer Jimmy Taktor said.
''That's all I can say.''
</P>
<P>
   Magician, who now has earned $1,504,385, paid $6, $2.40 and
$2.10. Long shot Ringside Rocket finished third.
</P>
<P>
   Western Ideal, driven by Mike Lachance, won the $440,000
Breeders Crown Pace for older horses by a half-length over Royal
Flush Hanover in a record 1:48.
</P>
<P>
   Western Ideal held off a late bid by Royal Flush Hanover at the
wire. Dragon Again, the 4-5 favorite, finished third.
</P>
<P>
   ''We needed a little luck in a race like that,'' Lachance said.
''I have to give (trainer) Brett Pelling all the credit. Every time
we need him for a race he's there in top shape. The horse is really
sharp and has the right timing.''
</P>
<P>
   Western Ideal paid $8, $5.80 and $2.10.
</P>
<P>
   In the $332,500 Breeders Crown Mares Pace, Ron's Girl, a $40,000
supplemental entry, held off a late charge by Galleria to win by a
nose in 1:50 4-5.
</P>
<P>
   Trained by Mike Bishop for the Joe Anderson stable and driven by
Lachance, she paid $4.20, $2.60 and $2.20. It was her third
straight victory and ninth in 13 starts this year. L'Chaim finished
third.

<HEADLINE> Ray Wins National Gymnastics Title  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Thanks, Magnificent Seven, but the new kids are
doing just fine on their own at the U.S. Gymnastics Championships.
</P>
<P>
   While the 1996 Olympians were showing some rust to go with their
gold, Elise Ray, Kristen Maloney, Vanessa Atler and Jamie
Dantzscher proved they're up to the task of bringing home a medal
from Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Ray ended Maloney's two-year run as national champion, narrowly
winning with 76.987 points. She sealed her victory with two solid
vaults, and coach Kelli Hill and several USA Gymnastics officials
jumped from their seats at Kiel Center when she finished.
</P>
<P>
   Ray came off the podium with a big smile on her face and was
immediately swallowed up in a hug from Hill. Maloney then came over
to congratulate Ray, and the two friends hugged.
</P>
<P>
   Ray was just 0.275 points ahead of Maloney, who finished with
76.712 points. Dantzscher was third with 75.700, and Atler was
fourth with 75.412.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Miller and Jaycie Phelps skipped Saturday night's
all-around finals with injuries and will petition for a spot at
next month's Olympic trials. That cut the Magnificent Seven to
three -- Dominique Moceanu, Dominique Dawes and Amy Chow -- and they
were less than magnificent.
</P>
<P>
   Chow slipped from third to sixth, finishing with 75.175 points.
Dominique Moceanu finished in eight place with 73.424 points, and
Dawes was right behind her with 73.412.
</P>
<P>
   The top 12 finishers at nationals advanced to next month's
Olympic trials, where Bela Karolyi will head a committee that will
choose a six-member team. Performances at nationals and trials will
be used to rank the gymnasts, but they won't be binding.
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu, competing on a sprained left ankle, was solid but not
spectacular, scoring one 8.9 and not earning anything higher than a
9.425.
</P>
<P>
   Dawes, who only began training seriously in April, had Karolyi
pumping his fists and high-fiving anyone who got near him after a
stunning routine on the uneven bars that moved her from 13th place
to ninth.
</P>
<P>
   But she struggled on the balance beam and vault. A shaky landing
of her aerial front somersault forced her to jump off the beam and
she scored an 8.85. She landed on her seat on her first vault, and
Hill gave her a long, reassuring hug afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Chow started the night in third place and moved steadily
downward. She took hops on each of her vaults and almost fell off
the balance beam, drawing gasps from the crowd as she wobbled.
</P>
<P>
   Her biggest disaster was on the uneven bars, where she won her
individual silver medal at the Atlanta Olympics. Chow was doing a
back somersault as she moved from the high bar to the low bar when
she missed her catch and crashed into the low bar. She scored a
9.125.
</P>
<P>
   The youngsters, meanwhile, were holding things together quite
nicely.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's mother was a dancer and her daughter has obviously
inherited her grace. She practically floated through her routines,
making one difficult one after another look easy. Even her mistakes
looked good.
</P>
<P>
   On the uneven bars, her hands appeared to slip on a release move
on the top bar. It could have been disastrous -- a slip has sent
plenty of other gymnasts crashing to the floor -- but Ray managed to
grab the bar and continued on as if nothing happened.
</P>
<P>
   On beam, she did her aerial back handsprings, pirouettes,
somersaults with such ease she might as well have been doing them
on the floor instead of an apparatus that's only four inches wide
and four feet off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Maloney performed with the swagger that goes along with her two
national titles. On her floor exercise, done to a series of jazzy
piano numbers, she practically strutted on her dance sequences.
When she finished, she allowed a little smile while her coaches
cheered.
</P>
<P>
   Atler -- who has a bubbly personality to rival that of Mary Lou
Retton -- had Karolyi smiling and clapping every time she was on the
podium. On her floor routine, he was clapping along as she whipped
across the floor to the strains of Russian folk music.
</P>
<P>
   Dantzscher, a world team member last year, might have been the
surprise finisher of the night. But she stuck every one of her
routines and finished out the night with a solid beam routine that
sent her hurtling into her coach's arms when she finished.

<HEADLINE> Kona Gold Wins Del Mar Feature  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEL MAR, Calif. (AP) -- Kona Gold, ridden by Alex Solis, edged
Love That Red, ridden by Victor Espinoza, through the home stretch
to win the $194,000 Bing Crosby Breeders' Cup Handicap by a
three-quarters of a length Saturday at Del Mar.
</P>
<P>
   Kona Gold brushed Love That Red in deep stretch and Espinoza
claimed a foul. However, track stewards said there was no
interference, that the brush was minor and did not warrant
disqualification. Love That Red finished seven lengths in front of
Lexicon and Kent Desormeaux in a field of six 3-years-old and up.
</P>
<P>
   Kona Gold covered the six furlongs in 1:08 2-5 to win $124,200.
It was his seventh win in 15 starts. The 6-year-old gelding sired
by Java Gold is unbeaten in four races at Del Mar.
</P>
<P>
   Kona Gold paid $3.20, $2.10 and $2.10. Love That Red returned
$2.60 and $2.10, while Lexicon paid $2.10 to show.
</P>
<P>
   In the $109,400 Osunitas Handicap, Eddie Delahoussaye rode
Smooth Player to a wire-to-wire win, finishing a half-length in
front of Beautiful Noise and Chris McCarron. Another half-length
back was Evening Promise and Garrett Gomez in a field of six
fillies and mares, 3-years-old and up.
</P>
<P>
   Smooth Player covered 1 1-16 miles on a turf course rated fast
in 1:42 3-5 to win $65,640. Smooth Player paid $10.60, $6.40 and
$4. Beautiful Noise returned $4.60 and $3.40, while Evening Promise
paid $4.80 to show.

<HEADLINE> Divers Wrap Up Monitor Expedition  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (AP) -- Navy divers wrapped up their summer
expedition to the wreckage of the USS Monitor on Saturday, using
their final dives to raise parts of the sunken Civil War
battleship's propeller and rudder mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
   Each summer since 1995, divers have descended 240 feet to the
ocean floor off Cape Hatteras, N.C., to salvage parts of the
historic ironclad ship and map its wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   The Monitor, best known for its battle against the Confederate
CSS Virginia in the first clash of ironclad vessels, sank in a
storm while being towed port in 1862. Its wreckage was found in
1973.
</P>
<P>
   Working in heavy rains and high winds last week, divers
recovered a 10-foot-long segment of the ship's propeller shaft, an
11-foot-wide section of attached bulkhead and the ship's
21-foot-long skeg, which held the rudder in place.
</P>
<P>
   The recoveries and time the divers have spent shoring up the
sunken vessel over the past six weeks helped clear the way for next
summer's mission: recovering the ship's steam engine from an engine
room that is a maze of pumps and gauges.
</P>
<P>
   The joint Navy and National Ocean Service expeditions recovered
the Monitor's propeller in 1998, and divers hope to one day raise
its gun turret.
</P>
<P>
   The shaft and skeg, meanwhile, are due to arrive Monday at The
Mariners' Museum in Newport News, where all the recovered pieces
are to eventually be placed in a center dedicated to the Monitor.

<HEADLINE> Reds 4, Expos 3, 11 Innings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Eddie Taubensee hit a game-tying homer with two
outs in the ninth inning and homered again in the 11th to lead the
Cincinnati Reds over the Montreal Expos 4-3 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Taubensee, who went 3-for-5 and raised his season home-run total
to six, homered off Javier Vazquez to overcome a 3-2 deficit in the
ninth. The second homer came off Julio Santana (0-2) with one out
in the 11th as Cincinnati improved to 8-4 in extra-innings.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Wohlers pitched two perfect innings, giving him eight
scoreless innings since Cincinnati brought him up earlier this
month. Danny Graves (10-2) pitched three shutout innings in relief
of Pete Harnisch.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati's Sean Casey doubled in the sixth to extend his
career-best hitting streak to 20 games.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams failed to score in the 10th, despite putting runners
in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Larkin hit a one-out single off Scott Strickland leading
off and stole second. Ken Griffey Jr. was intentionally walked
before Strickland got Dante Bichette to pop out to catcher Chris
Widger. Reliever Scott Forster got Casey to ground to first to end
the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Milton Bradley singled off Graves to lead off the bottom half
and advanced to second on Peter Bergeron's sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Vidro followed with a slow roller fielded by Graves, who
threw to first for the second out as Bradley held at second.
Vladimir Guerrero was intentionally walked and Graves threw a
called third strike past Mike Mordecai.
</P>
<P>
   After allowing Larkin's one-out single in the first, Vazquez
retired 13 in a row before Taubensee and Reese hit consecutive
singles with two outs in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Reese followed Taubensee's game-tying homer in the ninth with a
single to chase Vazquez, who allowed three runs and seven hits in 8
2-3 innings. He had a season-high nine strikeouts and walked none.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Kline struck out pinch-hitter Alex Ochoa to end the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Blum had a run-scoring single in the fourth and Tomas De
La Rosa hit his second major league homer off Harnisch leading off
the fifth for a 2-0 lead. Jose Vidro's two-out RBI single drove in
the Expos' second run of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati closed on four straight one-out hits in the sixth.
Larkin hit his second single with one out, Griffey tripled and
Dante Bichette singled. After Casey's double put runners on second
and third, Dmitri Young grounded to shortstop and De La Rosa threw
out Bichette at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Harnisch allowed all three runs and seven hits in six innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Harnisch is 1-3 in nine career starts in Montreal. His only
win at Olympic Stadium 's only win in Montreal was 8-1 with a
three-hitter on Aug. 24, 1998. ... Casey was 1-for-5 and is hitting
.395 (30-for-76) with four homers and 17 RBIs over the course of
the streak, the longest by a Cincinnati player since Hal Morris hit
safely in 29 consecutive games in 1996. ... Vazquez had a
career-high 10 strikeouts last Sept. 14 at Los Angeles.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Cliff Politte allowed four hits in seven
scoreless inning to beat Kevin Brown and lead the struggling
Philadelphia Phillies over the Los Angeles Dodgers 3-0 Saturday
night
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia had lost four straight, eight of 10, and hadn't won
since Curt Schilling beat Pittsburgh last Sunday. Schilling was
traded to Arizona on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Politte (2-2), called up Friday when Paul Byrd was placed on the
disabled list, made his case to remain in a depleted rotation that
suddenly finds itself without an ace.
</P>
<P>
   The 26-year-old right-hander didn't allow a hit until Todd
Hundley singled with two outs in the fourth, and won for the first
time since June 17. He struck out six and walked three, tying the
longest outing of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Vicente Padilla, one of four players acquired in the Schilling
deal, pitched a scoreless eighth despite allowing two singles and a
walk. He retired Adrian Beltre on a grounder to shortstop with the
bases loaded, ending the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Brantley got his 16th save in 19 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Brown (10-4), who had won six of his previous seven decisions,
allowed three runs and six hits in six innings, walked four and
struck out five.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Rolen's RBI fielder's choice gave the Phillies a 1-0 lead
in the first. Philadelphia got three hits in the first off Brown,
who had allowed just four hits and one earned run in his previous
two starts, spanning 16 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Glanville led off with a single, advanced to third on a
single by Mickey Morandini and scored on Rolen's one-out grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Politte started a two-run fifth with a one-out double -- his
first career extra-base hit.
</P>
<P>
   After Glanville walked, Morandini doubled to right, scoring
Politte to make it 2-0. Morandini scored on Bobby Abreu's bouncer
to second for a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles had two runners on base just once against Politte
after he walked two batters in the second. Politte got out of the
jam by striking out Alex Cora and Brown to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Politte retired seven in a row and 12 of 14 at one point.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The start was delayed 15 minutes for a ceremony honoring
Phillies broadcaster Harry Kalas, who is celebrating his 30th year
with the team. Former Phillies catcher Darren Daulton was the
master of ceremonies. Both Kalas and Daulton received rousing
ovations, while fans booed team chairman Bill Giles. Even Mitch
Williams was cheered. ... Phillies 1B Rico Brogna, who is likely to
be dealt before Monday's trade deadline, received a loud ovation
when he came to the plate in the first... Gary Sheffield flied out
to center in the sixth in his 5,000th career at-bat. ... Beltre had
three hits, including a grand slam, and eight RBIs with the bases
loaded in his last three at-bats with the bases full prior to
Saturday. ... Los Angeles had won five of six.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Free agent Dee Brown and the Orlando Magic
have agreed on a contract.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, a guard who has played the past three seasons for the
Toronto Raptors, told the Orlando Sentinel he will join the Magic
for the league minimum for a 10-year veteran -- $1 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, 31, came into the league with Boston in 1990. He has
played both point and shooting guard, and would be a reserve with
the Magic.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll be the old man on this team, the senior spokesman,''
Brown said Friday. ''But I'll take the role seriously on and off
the court. I've still got a lot of basketball left in me. I'm smart
enough to run a team, and I consider myself a pretty good
shooter.''
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- John Flaherty broke up an pitching duel
between Albie Lopez and Kansas City's Mac Suzuki by hitting his
first homer since June 9, leading the Tampa Bay Devil Rays over the
Royals 2-1 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Flaherty homered in the sixth inning, his first RBI since June
18, and Greg Vaughn homered off Suzuki (5-6) in the eighth as Tampa
Bay stretched a winning streak to four for the first time since
last Aug. 18-21.
</P>
<P>
   The last three games of that streak were against the Royals in
Tampa Bay, and it was the the last time the Devil Rays swept a
series.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Quinn homered in the ninth off Lopez (8-7), and Roberto
Hernandez came in to get the final out for his 19th save in 23
chances, including 13 in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez gave up seven hits, struck out three and walked none.
</P>
<P>
   Suzuki, who has lost six of his last eight starts, matched his
career high by striking out eight. He allowed four hits in eight
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City (25-26) fell under .500 for the first time at home
for the first time this season.
Notes: Royals RF Todd Dunwoody, subbing for Jermaine Dye, made a
long run to catch a ball hit by Miguel Cairo in foul territory in
the first and then made another running catch of Gerald Williams'
sinking liner in the fifth. ... Dye was the designated hitter after
missing Friday's game with a mild concussion after crashing into
the wall going after a fly ball Thursday. ... The Devil Rays have
had 43 players on the roster this season after Paul Wilson, Jason
Tyner and Travis Harper joined the team before the game. ... Suzuki
struck out four batters in a row in the first and second innings.
Vaughn struck out swinging to end the first, Fred McGriff and Jose
Canseco looked at third strikes before Steve Cox had a weak swing
on an off-speed pitch to end the second inning.

<HEADLINE> Southeast Michigan Storms Continue  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Heavy rains that pounded parts of Michigan for a
second day Saturday disrupted Detroit-area air travel while leaving
thousands without electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit Metropolitan Airport grounded many flights Saturday
morning but was operating normally about 90 minutes later. About 90
Northwest Airlines flights had been cancelled after storms Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't look that bad,'' airport spokesman Mike Conway said
Saturday. ''Everything's still moving.''
</P>
<P>
   About 7,500 Detroit Edison customers were without power, said
utility spokesman Lew Layton. Most residents will have their power
restored by Saturday night, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A few hundred Consumers Energy customers who also lost power
will have their service restored by midnight Saturday, a spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service said an average of 2.3 inches of
rain fell by Saturday afternoon. Flash flood watches were posted
for much of southeast Michigan, which could get as much as 5 inches
of rain.
</P>
<P>
   ''The main concern is for the motorists who are out on the
streets, but people with property should take stock of their
surroundings,'' said Darin Figurskey, a meteorologist in Oakland
County.
</P>
<P>
   The storms Saturday and Friday caused as much as 8 inches of
water to pool on stretches of Interstate 75 near Flint, reducing
the freeway to just one usable lane in both directions.

<HEADLINE> Negotiators in S.Korea For Talks  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North and South Korea opened
high-level talks in Seoul on Sunday, hoping to work out measures to
implement the agreement forged in the historic meeting of their
leaders last month.
</P>
<P>
   ''The summit was a historic event that opened an era of
reconciliation, unity and unification. So we must produce a big
artistic item out of this talks,'' Jun Kum Jin, the chief North
Korean delegate, said before starting the talks at a Seoul hotel.
</P>
<P>
   His South Korean counterpart, Unification Minister, Park
Jae-kyu, pledged full efforts to make progress, saying that the two
sides now ''must move into the stage to faithfully implement the
summit agreements.''
</P>
<P>
   They two delegations shook hands then entered their closed-door
talks. Another session was scheduled for the afternoon, and more
talks could be held on Monday. To avoid political friction, no
flags or other national emblems were used for the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes for progress in the talks -- the first such meeting since
1992 -- have been fueled by the June summit between South Korean
President Kim Dae-jung and North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, during
both leaders agreed to work together for reconciliation and
unification.
</P>
<P>
   The North Koreans were scheduled to meet Kim Dae-jung before
leaving Seoul on Monday afternoon. The delegation arrived from
Beijing, since there are no direct flights between the two Koreas.
</P>
<P>
   The Koreas have been bitter Cold War enemies since the division
of their peninsula into the communist North and the capitalist
South in 1945. Their three-year war in the early 1950s ended in an
armistice, not in a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The 1992 talks came when the prime ministers of the two
countries for reconciliation talks, but those negotiations were
overshadowed by political tension.
</P>
<P>
   The agreements from the June summit call for wide-ranging
economic and other exchanges. The Koreas already have stopped
propaganda broadcasts directed at each other and are preparing to
arrange cross-border travels by 100 people each in mid-August for
temporary family reunions, the first since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the conciliatory mood, the South's Kim Dae-jung has said
reunification could take two or three decades and has warned his
military to stay on alert in close cooperation with the 37,000 U.S.
troops stationed here.
</P>
<P>
   The North Korean delegation does not include officials handling
economic and military affairs, although South Korea hoped to
discuss opening a military hotline and connecting rail lines across
the border.
</P>
<P>
   A senior South Korean official, briefing local reporters on
condition of anonymity, said his government will put a priority on
efforts to regularize such high-level talks with North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea, the official said, will also seek to form several
subcommittees with North Korea to handle military, economic,
cultural and sports exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   Topics will also include a proposed visit to Seoul by Kim Jong
Il, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The official did not rule out the possibility of South Korea
raising the issue of the North's missile program. The program is a
major reason behind Washington's plan to build national and
regional anti-missile defense shields.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was discussed at a meeting between U.S. Secretary of
State Madeline Albright and North Korean Foreign Minister Paek Nam
during an Asian regional security forum in Bangkok, Thailand, last
week.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Troops To Delpoy in S. Lebanon  </HEADLINE>
By ZEINA KARAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- The Lebanese president has given the
go-ahead for more U.N. troops to deploy along the Lebanese-Israeli
border, starting Sunday, the Untied Nations said.
</P>
<P>
   The deployment will take place in four different locations, the
U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon, or UNIFIL, said Saturday in a
statement, following consultations between U.N. commanders and
Lebanese officials.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear why the peacekeepers were to take
up positions at only four border points. A possible reason was
Lebanon's complaint that Israel continues to violate a U.N.-drawn
border line following its May withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ''The decision to give the go-ahead to UNIFIL to redeploy was
given today (Saturday) by President Emile Lahoud,'' said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes a day after 30 Ghanaian and a small
number of Irish soldiers took up positions on two hills on the
Lebanese-Israeli border. The U.N. plans to send a total of 5,000
peacekeepers to the border, but Beirut has held up deployment,
saying it is waiting for Israel to stop border violations.
</P>
<P>
   Though limited, Friday's moves were the first sign of a
long-awaited U.N. presence in the Israeli-evacuated zone that is
expected to improve security in the border area. Anti-Israel
guerrillas have been the real authority in the area since Israel's
May 24 withdrawal ended 18 years of Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. deployment comes as Lebanon was preparing a complaint
against Israel to be filed at the International Court of Justice in
The Hague seeking compensation for its occupation of southern
Lebanon, according to a statement Saturday. The statement did not
say how much money Lebanon would seek; reports vary from $30
billion to $40 billion.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Adrienne Goodson scored a career high 29
points as the Utah Starzz beat the Indiana Fever 79-71 Saturday
night, extended their winning streak to three games.
</P>
<P>
   Utah took control of the game early, leading by as many as 13 in
the first half and never trailing in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Alicia Thompson led the way for the Fever with 18 points and
eight rebounds before fouling out in the final two minutes of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana was outscored at the free-throw line 28-11. However, the
Fever shot 10-for-18 (55.6 percent) on 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana went on a 10-2 run midway through the second half to cut
Utah's lead to 54-52, but couldn't get closer.
</P>
<P>
   Goodson had some help from Natalie Williams, who scored 22 and
grabbed a game high 15 rebounds. Margo Dydek added 11 points.

<HEADLINE> Rockies 10, Brewers 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Maybe it should have been Jeffrey Hammonds
Poster Night.
</P>
<P>
   Hammonds hit a two-run homer in the first inning and had three
hits and three RBIs as the Colorado Rockies ended a 10-game road
losing streak by routing the Milwaukee Brewers 10-2 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies spoiled the Brewers' debut of Paul Rigdon (0-1),
acquired Friday in a seven-player trade with Cleveland. Rigdon
sandwiched two strikeouts around a single by Neifi Perez before
Hammonds lined the first pitch 370 feet for his 17th homer of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was supposed to be Bob Wickman Poster Night, but the
right-handed closer was also in the trade with Cleveland on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado scored six in the ninth on Perez's sacrifice fly, Larry
Walker's RBI single, Todd Helton's RBI double, former Brewer Jeff
Cirillo's two-run double and Brent Mayne's RBI single, all off Bob
Scanlan.
</P>
<P>
   Jeromy Burnitz, the subject of trade talks, hit his 22nd homer
with two outs in the ninth to spoil the shutout. Angel Echevarria
followed with his first homer of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Julian Tavarez (6-2), who made 250 relief appearances since his
last start four seasons ago, went 5 1-3 innings, allowed four hits,
struck out three and walked none. He lowered his ERA from 5.36 to
4.85.
</P>
<P>
   Tavarez's last start came with Cleveland against the Minnesota
Twins on July 20, 1996. He had a no-decision when the Indians
rallied to win 6-5 after he allowed five runs in 3 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies made it 3-0 in the fourth when Hammonds walked, went
to third on Mayne's single and scored on a wild pitch with two
outs.
</P>
<P>
   Walker doubled with two outs in the fifth and scored on
Hammonds' single for a 4-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Rigdon left after five innings, allowing seven hits while
striking out three and walking two.
</P>
<P>
   Tavarez, who allowed only one runner to advance past second
base, was relieved by Gabe White in the sixth after pinch-hitter
Raul Casanova and Marquis Grissom singled. White retired Geoff
Jenkins on a grounder and Charlie Hayes on a fly to center.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Milwaukee's Jeff D'Amico is a candidate for NL Pitcher of
the Month. Sunday's starter is 4-0 with a 0.45 ERA in five starts
in July. ... Eight of the 25 players on Milwaukee's roster played
in Colorado's organization. They are Juan Acevedo, Curtis Leskanic,
Jamey Wright, Henry Blanco, Casanova, Hayes, Echevarria and Chris
Jones. ... The Rockies lead the NL in runs scored (626), but are
last in home runs (102). The last team to hold that distinction was
the 1943 Brooklyn Dodgers; before that, the 1898 Baltimore Orioles.
... The Brewers purchased the contract of Scanlan from Triple-A
Indianapolis. ... Jones and Echevarria exchanged uniform numbers;
Jones will wear 38 and Echevarria 39. ... Since the All-Star break,
the Brewers have made only three errors in 16 games, and none in
their last 11. ... The Rockies started five players batting higher
than .300; the Brewers none.

<HEADLINE> Googoosh Returns to Public Arena  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- A cheering, weeping crowd leaped up to clap and
sing along Saturday night as Googoosh, the best-selling Iranian
entertainer, performed in public for the first time since before
the Islamic revolution of 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Now 50, the petite singer-actress displayed the same seductive
style that made her a cultural trendsetter in Iran during the 1960s
and 70s. Her voice, still strong despite the two-decade layoff
during her isolated life in the Islamic republic, brought shouts of
joy, as did her Persian dancing with waving arms and swaying hips.
</P>
<P>
   The tour -- with a dozen stops planned in Canada and the United
States -- illustrates the moderate turn taken by the Iranian
leadership since the 1997 election of President Mohammad Khatami.
Her appearance in Canada showed the government was willing to allow
her to perform outside the country in a manner prohibited in Iran,
where females can only entertain all-female crowds.
</P>
<P>
   On a darkened stage decorated with Roman-style pillars of
pre-Islamic Persia, Googoosh emerged as the audience of more than
12,000 -- less than a sellout -- screamed and cried.
</P>
<P>
   She stood with arms outstretched as the lights came up, then
blew kisses to the crowd and wiped away tears amid the cheering.
Speaking Farsi, she offered greetings to the expatriate community
from ''your mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters from Iran.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they would allow me to deliver their greetings to you
and to wish that one day we're all in Iran,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the show, most fans said they had never expected Googoosh
to perform again, though it was their most fervent wish. ''All my
relatives are waiting for me to call them in Iran after show,''
said Roya Farzam as she headed into the arena with her husband.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Associated Press this week, Googoosh
said she decided to stay in Iran after the 1979 revolution out of
love her for her homeland, giving up the chance to continue to
perform abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Before the revolution, Googoosh set fashion trends with short
dresses and cropped hair. Like Elvis and the Beatles, she was so
strongly associated with the 60s generation that even after she
stopped performing, her music continued to sell strongly, with
parents teaching the songs to their children.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamic revolution stamped out what was considered the
cultural decadence symbolized by Googoosh. For the next 20 years,
Googoosh lived mostly alone in her Tehran apartment, forced by the
strictures of the Islamic republic to dress modestly and stop
performing. She said she sometimes hummed or sang softly to herself
at the piano.
</P>
<P>
   More concerts are scheduled for Los Angeles, New York, Chicago,
Dallas, Houston and other cities, and she also will be shooting two
films directed by her husband, Massoud Kimiai.

<HEADLINE> Twins 6, Yankees 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Chad Moeller hit a tiebreaking three-run
inside-the-park home run, his first major league homer, as the
Minnesota Twins rallied for six runs in the eighth inning to beat
the New York Yankees 6-2 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Mike Stanton began the eighth with a 2-0 lead, but gave
up a single to Matt Lawton and David Ortiz's ground-rule double.
Ramiro Mendoza (7-4), activated Friday from the 15-day disabled
list, then walked the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Jacque Jones tied the game with a two-run single before
Moeller's sinking liner into left field got past a diving Ryan
Thompson and rolled all the way to the wall, making it 5-2. Rookie
Randy Choate walked Ron Coomer with the bases loaded to force in
the final run.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Milton (10-6) pitched no-hit ball through 5 1-3 innings,
and gave up his only two hits in the sixth. He retired 15 of the
first 16 batters he faced, the final eight he faced, and got eight
of his 10 strikeouts in the first four innings. He walked two in
eight innings, and LaTroy Hawkins completed the combined
two-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who had 17 hits Friday night, lost for the first
time in 48 games when leading after seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota has won seven of nine.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Clemens did not allow a hit for 4 2-3 innings before
Cristian Guzman singled sharply into center. Clemens, still 5-0 in
July, stranded eight Twins runners, including three at third base.
He allowed three singles and five walks and struck out four in
seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees broke open a scoreless game with two runs in the
sixth. Ryan Thompson walked, took second on Jose Vizcaino's single
and scored on Derek Jeter's RBI single, New York's only two hits of
the game. Paul O'Neill's sacrifice fly scored Vizcaino to make it
2-0.
</P>
<P>
Notes@: Glenallen Hill's pinch-hit grand slam that won Friday's
game was his 12th career pinch-hit home run. It also was New York's
fourth grand slam of the season. ... Since his Yankees debut June
30, David Justice is batting .350 (28-for-80) with 15 runs, 19
RBIs, six homers, six doubles and 14 walks in 23 games. ... RF
Torii Hunter was recalled Friday night from Triple-A Salt Lake
City. Hunter, 25, was batting .368 (77-for-209) with 18 home runs,
17 doubles and 61 RBIs in 55 games for the Buzz. Hunter replaced
Chad Allen, who was sent to Salt Lake City. ... The Twins have not
had a winning record in any month in 2000. They are 12-13 in July
with two games left. In 1999, the Twins' lone winning month was
July (15-11).

last month prompted protests that led to the arrest of more than 100 activists.
The Navy published an environmental impact advisory in local newspapers today
notifying citizens that the USS Harry Truman Battle Group may have ship-to-land

Israel blamed the Palestinians for lacking the flexibility to forge a historic

<HEADLINE> Liberty 81, Rockers 67  </HEADLINE>
By MELISSA MURPHY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Crystal Robinson had 17 points as six New York
players scored in double figures to lead the Liberty to an 81-67
victory over the Cleveland Rockers on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The start of the game was delayed 1 hour, 40 minutes because the
Liberty starters were still en route from Charlotte due to stormy
weather and airport cancellations.
</P>
<P>
   The Eastern Conference-leading Liberty (17-10) won their fourth
straight and extended their lead to 2&AMP;frac12; games over the second-place
Rockers and Orlando Miracle with five games remaining.
</P>
<P>
   New York, winners of 10 of 11 games, got 14 points from Tari
Phillips. Tamika Whitmore had 12 points and Teresa Weatherspoon and
Sue Wicks added 11 apiece. Vickie Johnson, held scoreless in the
first half, finished with 10.
</P>
<P>
   Chasity Melvin led Cleveland (14-12) with 16 points and Rushia
Brown added 14 points and 10 rebounds. Ann Wauters, the No. 1 draft
pick, injured her right knee in the second half but returned to the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Leading 57-51 midway through the second half, the Liberty went
on an 11-2 run, capped by Weatherspoon's steal and layup for a
68-53 lead with 5:30 remaining. The Rockers came within 10 points
in the final minutes, but couldn't get any closer.
</P>
<P>
   New York, winners of seven straight at home, led 35-33 at
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty looked sluggish, shooting 2-for-9 in the opening
five minutes. The Rockers led 14-4 before New York went on a 13-4
run to trim the deficit to 18-17 with 9:57 left. Robinson had seven
points in the run.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland opened up a seven-point lead on a layup by Wauters,
but the Liberty went on a 12-5 run to tie the score at 31 on
Whitmore's 3-point play.
</P>
<P>
   New York, which missed 13 of 16 shots during one stretch in the
first half, finished 31-for-58 (53.4 percent) from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland has dropped eight of nine road games.

<HEADLINE> Falcons 20, Colts 13  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE HERMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Danny Kanell threw for two touchdowns
following big mistakes by Indianapolis as the Atlanta Falcons beat
the Colts 20-13 Saturday night in both teams' preseason opener.
</P>
<P>
   The first touchdown pass, 14 yards to Brian Kozlowski in the
second quarter, was set up when Colts rookie David Macklin bobbled
a punt that the Falcons recovered at the Indianapolis 25.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with the score tied midway through the fourth period, a
personal foul on Billy Austin gave Atlanta the ball at the Colts
13, where Kanell passed to Brian Finneran for the winning TD.
</P>
<P>
   The only Indianapolis touchdown was on a 4-yard pass from Peyton
Manning to Marvin Harrison early in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Neither team used its starters much beyond that point, and the
only other scores for the Colts came on a pair of field goals by
Mike Vanderjagt.
</P>
<P>
   Five of Manning's six completions were to Harrison, four on the
Colts' scoring drive that started late in the first quarter after a
21-yard field goal by the Falcons' Morten Andersen.
</P>
<P>
   Passes of 26, 17 and 7 yards to Harrison took Indianapolis to
the Atlanta 24, and an offsides penalty on the Falcons and a 4-yard
run by Edgerrin James took them to the 15 as the quarter ended.
After a pass interference penalty on Henri Crockett put the Colts
at the 10, Manning completed a pass of 6 yards to Marcus Pollard to
set up the 4-yarder to Harrison for a 7-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta had to punt on its next possession, but the ball bounced
off Macklin and was recovered for the Falcons by Bob Christian at
the Indianapolis 25. Kanell, who replaced starter Chris Chandler
after the first Atlanta series, passed 7 yards to Jammi German and
three plays later hit Kozlowski for the first touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Doug Johnson took over at quarterback at the start of the
third quarter and completed passes of 23 and 19 yards to Finneran
before rookie Jake Arians kicked a 20-yard field goal for a 13-7
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderjagt, who last year led the NFL in scoring and made his
last 26 field goal attempts, hit a 42-yarder late in the third
quarter and tied the game 13-13 with a 44-yard field goal early in
the final period.
</P>
<P>
   Kanell returned at quarterback after Vanderjagt's second field
goal. Rookie Maurice Smith rushed four times, including 34 yards to
the Indianapolis 26. Then, on third-and-10, Austin was called for a
late hit on an incomplete pass, moving the Falcons half the
distance to the goal. Kanell passed to Finneran two plays later for
the winning score.

<HEADLINE> Marlins 4, Diamondbacks 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- In between Curt Schilling and Randy Johnson, the
Diamondbacks sent out Brian Anderson to face the Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   While Anderson did his job, Florida rallied against Arizona's
bullpen and beat the Diamondbacks 4-2 Saturday night as Dave Berg
hit a tiebreaking two-run single in a three-run eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Sanchez, Dan Miceli (4-2) and Antonio Alfonseca combined
on a two-hitter, helping Florida beat the Diamondbacks for just the
fourth time in 19 meetings. Arizona had won six straight at Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, winless in six starts since June 28, allowed one run
and five hits in 6 1-3 innings, but Byung-Hyun Kim (2-5) couldn't
hold a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Smith singled and stole second, Preston Wilson walked, Kim
threw a wild pitch and Mike Lowell's bloop double down the
right-field line tied it.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Morgan then relieved and Berg singled to center.
</P>
<P>
   Miceli pitched a hitless eighth and Alfonseca threw a perfect
ninth for his 30th save in 33 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez allowed two runs, two hits and six walks in seven
innings, striking out five. He threw a run-scoring wild pitch in
the third and allowed Damian Miller's fourth-inning homer.
</P>
<P>
   Florida pulled to 2-1 in the seventh on Ramon Castro's sacrifice
fly.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Anderson hit a booming 400-foot double in the fourth, his
second double of the season. He is 10-for-47 (.213) at the plate
this season. ... Lowell's line-drive got lodged in the cushions
under the left-field scoreboard for a ground-rule double in the
fifth. ... Luis Castillo went 0-for-4, ending his hitting streak at
19 games, two shy of tying the team record set by Greg Colbrunn,
now with Arizona.

<HEADLINE> Jets 24, Saints 20  </HEADLINE>
By BILL BARNARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Vaughn Sanders' 1-yard run with
1:17 left capped a 72-yard touchdown drive led by fellow rookie
Chad Pennington as the New York Jets overcame four turnovers to
beat New Orleans 24-20 in a preseason opener Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets converted seven of 10 third-down plays and moved the
ball well all night as their three quarterbacks -- Vinny Testaverde,
Ray Lucas and Pennington -- combined to complete 25 of 33 passes.
</P>
<P>
   But New York fell behind 20-17 with 4:56 left on Chad Morton's
77-yard punt return before Pennington, who was 10-for-13 passing,
led the decisive drive that also included Sanders' run of 17 yards
to the Saints' 13.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Barnes, making his first appearance of the game, then drove
the Saints to the Jets' 28 with the help of a 40-yard pass to P.J.
Franklin, but Scott Frost's end-zone interception with 10 seconds
left sealed the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints were hit with three possibly season-ending injuries.
Starting tight end Cam Cleeland tore his left Achilles' tendon,
starting free safety Rob Kelly broke his right leg and cornerback
Steve Israel broke his left leg.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde, in his first game appearance since he ruptured an
Achilles' tendon in the Jets' season-opener last Sept. 12, gave the
Saints a touchdown late in the first quarter, underthrowing a short
pass that was intercepted by Sammy Knight and returned 65 yards.
The extra-point snap was fumbled by Toby Gowin.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde came back on the first play after the kickoff and
passed perfectly over the middle to Wayne Chrebet, who outraced the
secondary for a 75-yard touchdown, giving the Jets a 7-6 lead.
Testaverde finished 5-for-9 for 131 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas, 6-3 as a starter after Testaverde was injured, was
effective in relief, completing 10 of 11 passes for 88 yards,
including a 1-yard TD pass to rookie tight end Anthony Becht with
4:34 left in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Jake Delhomme, who finished New Orleans' 3-13 season as the
starting quarterback last year, outperformed free-agent signee Jeff
Blake. Delhomme, who was 14-of-19 for 124 yards, was especially
effective in the third quarter, completing eight of 10 passes for
64 yards, including a 22-yard scoring pass to Willie Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The touchdown came on the first play after Knight's recovery of
a fumbled punt by rookie Windrell Hayes, the Jets' fourth turnover
of the game.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans wanted to go for two points, but a penalty pushed
them back and they had to settle for a kicked extra point that left
the Jets with a 14-13 lead.
</P>
<P>
   After the Jets punted, Delhomme led another promising Saints
drive inside the New York 40, but he was sacked by Dorian Boose and
fumbled, with Boose recovering.
</P>
<P>
   Pennington then moved the Jets inside the 10, but the drive
bogged down and they settled for John Hall's 27-yard field goal,
giving New York a 17-13 lead.

<HEADLINE> Top U.S. Snowboarder Gets New Liver  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Top U.S. snowboarder Chris Klug was doing well
Saturday after a liver transplant 24 hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Klug, 27, of Aspen, got a new liver Friday morning at University
Hospital, spokeswoman Marcia Dailey said. He was in fair condition,
which she said was to be expected a day after surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ''The doctors say he's doing well,'' Dailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Dailey did not know when he would be released, but Klug has said
he expected to be in the hospital for up to a week after surgery
and then remain in Denver for three weeks while doctors monitor his
condition.
</P>
<P>
   ''I plan to make a full recovery by summer's end,'' the
snowboarder said several weeks before the transplant. ''Just as I
came back from my knee surgery this past winter season.''
</P>
<P>
   Klug was declared the national champion in the giant slalom when
he finished second to Canadian Jasey Jay Anderson in the U.S.
Snowboard Championships in March.
</P>
<P>
   He also won the World Cup giant slalom at Berchtesgaden,
Germany, in January and took the bronze in the super-G race at the
Goodwill Games in Lake Placid, N.Y., in February.
</P>
<P>
   After a routine physical five years ago, Klug was diagnosed with
PSC, a rare condition that attacks bile ducts within the liver. It
affects one in 10,000 people in the United States, mostly younger
men.
</P>
<P>
   Klug has said very little about his liver condition but had been
on a liver-transplant waiting list for more than three years before
the surgery. His condition had worsened recently.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Warns Rebels of Crackdown  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Extending their crackdown on coup supporters,
Fiji's military gave a group of armed rebels holding hostages at a
barracks until midnight Sunday to clear out or face ''drastic
action.''
</P>
<P>
   The town of Labasa on the Fiji's second-largest island of Vanua
Levu is one of few remaining pockets of hardcore support for
arrested coup leader George Speight, who is being held on a prison
island while authorities conduct a treason investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Around a dozen rebels have taken over a small military base at
Labasa and several times have taken small groups of ethnic Indians
hostage before letting them go. The group has not made any demands,
but their grievances include land claims, the military said.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Maj. Howard Politini said there were unconfirmed
reports that shots had been fired and a new group of ethnic Indians
were taken hostage Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Politini said the rebel group had been told to return all stolen
weapons and vacate the barracks by midnight Sunday. Failure to do
so would result in ''drastic action,'' which could include a raid
by troops.
</P>
<P>
   Speight, a failed businessman, led a group of indigenous Fijians
who stormed Parliament on May 19 and held dozens of officials for
two months.
</P>
<P>
   The military took power 10 days after the raid and finally met
rebel demands for an amnesty, discarding the multiracial
constitution and ousting the government of Mahendra Chaudhry,
Fiji's first prime minister of Indian descent.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, the last of the hostages were released on July 13.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels claim that ethnic Indians -- first brought to Fiji in
the 1870s by British colonialists as indentured laborers -- have too
much power and are threatening Fijian culture. Ethnic Indians make
up 44 percent of Fiji's 814,000 residents and dominate business and
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   A new Fijian government was sworn in Friday and is expected to
prepare the way for elections, possibly in three years. Although it
is strongly pro-indigenous Fijian, it includes no close Speight
supporters. It has one ethnic Indian, a junior minister.
</P>
<P>
   While promising a government of ''inclusion and compassion,''
new Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase said he will ''vigorously
pursue'' a nationalist agenda and will soon appoint a commission to
rewrite the constitution to strengthen indigenous Fijians' hold on
power.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhry left Fiji Sunday with his family on a flight to
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   In Sydney, Australian Prime Minister John Howard said he would
meet Chaudhry on Monday to discuss the crisis. Chaudhry has been
considering setting up a government in exile.
</P>
<P>
   In Fiji's western district, a group of tribal chiefs who met
Saturday said they would push forward with a plan to form a
breakaway government if Fiji does not return to rule under the 1997
multiracial constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Paulo Ralulu said the chiefs would present a
declaration of intent to President Ratu Josefa Iloilo soon. But it
was unclear if the signatories represented all the region's chiefs,
or exactly how the plan would proceed.
</P>
<P>
   More than 350 rebels, including Speight, were arrested last week
during the military crackdown. Speight had earlier threatened a new
campaign of civil unrest unless the new Cabinet was stacked with
his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The military said allegations that Speight had threatened
Iloilo's life could lead to charges of sedition or treason, which
carries a maximum penalty of death. Unlawful assembly, theft and
firearms offenses were also being investigated.
</P>
<P>
   Military spokesman Lt. Ro Alipate Mataitini said Speight and his
key advisers would be held on a small islet off Suva, the capital,
which has been declared a ''prison zone'' for as long as the
investigations took.
</P>
<P>
   ''They can try to make a swim for it, but there are plenty of
sharks out there in the harbor,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Late Change Lifts Ray to Title  </HEADLINE>
By EDDIE PELLS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- What a way to win a title.
</P>
<P>
   Elise Ray knew she needed a 9.151 on her last routine, the
vault, Saturday night to overtake her good friend, Kristen Maloney,
and win at the U.S. Gymnastics Championships.
</P>
<P>
   So, what did she do? She tried a vault she had never attempted
before in a meet.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said, 'OK, let's go find the vault number,''' said her
coach, Kelli Hill.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, it was vault No. 4505, known to those in
gymnastics circles as a Yurchenko Double Full.
</P>
<P>
   It's a one-and-a-half somersault in a stretched-out position,
with two twists. Trying it for the first time on a hard surface
since having arthroscopic knee surgery in June, Ray came through
big-time. But not before scaring her coach and half the staff at
USA Gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the vault, she approached the table where Bela
Karolyi, program director Kathy Kelly and a bunch of other
dignitaries sit.
</P>
<P>
   ''They all thought she had to go to the bathroom,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   Nope. Just needed to inform them that she was making a late
change in plans.
</P>
<P>
   She scored a 9.500 to give her a 9.425 average on her two
vaults, good enough for a .275 victory over Maloney.
</P>
<P>
   Karolyi and his cohorts all jumped out of their seats, hugging
each other, thrilled with the swashbuckling style Ray showed in the
most pressurized of moment. It's just the kind of thing the United
States could use at the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ''Elise loves competition,'' Hill said. ''She likes the
excitement and the thrill.''
</P>
<P>
   And Karolyi loves Ray.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really admire that young athlete,'' he said. ''Particularly
just coming back from the arthroscopic knee surgery three or four
weeks ago. It was a very, very, very good performance.''

<HEADLINE> Tigers 10, Rangers 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Hideo Nomo won for the first time since
July 8 and Deivi Cruz keyed a six-run first inning with a two-run
double as the Detroit Tigers stopped the Texas Rangers' four-game
winning streak, 10-2 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo (4-10), who lost his previous three starts, allowed two
runs and seven hits in eight innings, striking out seven and
walking two.
</P>
<P>
   Former-Ranger Juan Gonzalez went 3-for-4 for the Tigers, giving
him 1,500 hits for his career. Wendell Magee was 3-for-5 with three
RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Palmeiro hit his 389th career homer, tying him with
Johnny Bench for 36th on the career list, one behind Graig Nettles.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Rogers (10-8) had his shortest start of the season, giving
up eight runs and nine hits in 2 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   One day after the sixth anniversary of his perfect game, the
first by an AL left-hander, Rogers fell behind 6-0, hurt by a pair
of errors.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Palmer's bases-loaded grounder drove in the first run when
Texas third baseman Mike Lamb threw late to the plate. Magee
followed with a two-run single, Cruz added his two-run double, and
Shane Halter's RBI single made it 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez had a second-inning RBI single. In the third, Cruz
doubled and scored on a single by Hal Morris, who then got caught
in a rundown between first and second. Cruz crossed the plate
before Morris was tagged out, making it 8-0.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit went in front 10-0 in the fourth against Francisco
Cordero on Magee's RBI single and Halter's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Lamb's RBI single in the fifth ended Nomo's shutout bid, and
Palmeiro led off the sixth with his 28th homer to make it 10-2.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Rangers C Ivan Rodriguez visited his teammates for the
second straight night. Rodriguez had surgery Tuesday to repair a
fractured right thumb and is out for the season. ... Rodriguez is
wearing a soft cast and will be fitted for a splint next week. He
will then be able to resume running and riding an exercise bike.
The fracture is expected to heal in 6-10 weeks. ... Rogers lasted 2
2-3 innings in a start for the New York Mets last Sept. 25. ...
Gabe Kapler of the Rangers extended his career-high hitting streak
to 13 games with a sixth-inning double. ... Ricky Ledee made his
debut for the Rangers, coming in to play right field in the eighth.
He flied to deep left in his only at-bat. ... Rookie B.J. Waszgis
came in to catch in the eighth for the Rangers in his first major
league appearance. .. Cordero pitched 4 1-3 innings and struck out
five, both career highs.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Removed From Ballot  </HEADLINE>
By KELLIE B. GORMLY
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Members of the Reform Party's executive committee
voted Saturday to remove Pat Buchanan's name from the party's
presidential ballot, but Buchanan campaign officials called the
action ''bogus'' and without any standing.
</P>
<P>
   ''It means absolutely nothing,'' declared Bay Buchanan, the
candidate's sister and national co-chair of the Buchanan campaign.
''There's absolutely no question that Pat's still on the ballot.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven members of the executive committee voted unanimously to
remove Buchanan's name from ballots to be mailed to party members,
according to Jim Mangia, the party's secretary. He acknowledged the
group's decision could be overturned by the party's 164-member
national committee when it meets Aug. 8.
</P>
<P>
   If not reversed, the committee's decision would place Iowa
physicist John Hagelin as the party's presumed candidate for
president.
</P>
<P>
   But the Buchanan camp dismissed the executive committee vote
entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Bay Buchanan, calling the action ''irrelevant,'' said the
10-member committee did not have any standing because it did not
have a proper quorum. Two of the seven people who voted against
Buchanan were removed from the committee some time ago, she
maintained.
</P>
<P>
   Mangia could not be reached late Saturday to respond to the
claims by Buchanan campaign officials.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan was ''hijacking the party'' and thus had eliminated
himself as a legitimate candidate, Mangia told colleagues at a
meeting at an airport hotel, where the members of the executive
committee met.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are a party that was created on the principles of reform --
integrity and accountability,'' Mangia said. ''It's astounding ...
these kinds of dirty tricks.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the 10 members on the party's executive committee
attended the meeting -- the majority of whom are supporters of party
founder Ross Perot. They discussed Buchanan for about two hours
before voting.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the vote, Buchanan spokesman Brian Doherty dismissed
the effort as frivolous and called the allegations ''false and
outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They're just doing everything they can to obstruct us or
impede Buchanan's nomination,'' Doherty said Saturday before the
vote. ''They can't defeat us legitimately, so they go about it
trying to defeat us in other ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Under party rules, the 164-member national committee will review
the executive committee's decision when it meets Aug. 8 in Long
Beach, Calif. By a two-thirds vote, members could reverse the
executive committee's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anything the executive committee does today is a publicity
stunt if anything,'' said Bob Belcher, the party's Alabama state
chairman and a professed neutral.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan left the Republican Party last October to seek the
Reform nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan and Hagelin are competing for the party nod in the
primary, which is a mail-in vote for party members and others who
have asked for a ballot. Hagelin and Perot loyalists accused the
Buchanan camp earlier this week of illegally padding the lists of
ballot recipients with people from his Republican donor lists.
</P>
<P>
   At stake was control of the party apparatus and $12.6 million in
federal election funds that go to the party's nominee.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Keep Gun Buyback Program  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPPAQUA, N.Y. (AP) -- President Clinton intends to continue
offering federal money to local governments for gun buyback
programs, despite a challenge from House Republicans who claim the
administration lacks legal authority.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans to issue a statement Sunday that pledges continued
administration support for gun the federally subsidized buyback
programs, White House spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri said.
</P>
<P>
   She did not have details of the statement Saturday, but the
White House plans to answer congressional critics of the $15
million Buyback America program.
</P>
<P>
   After an overnight visit to his new home north of New York City,
Clinton is due to travel to Chicago on Sunday. He is scheduled to
address a fund-raising luncheon and the annual meeting of the
Association of Trial Lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Programs in at least 30 cities have been put on hold because of
the dispute between the Department of Housing and Urban Development
and the Republican chairman of the House appropriations
subcommittee that oversees HUD.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James T. Walsh, R-N.Y, said existing law did not authorize
such spending. His position is supported by the General Accounting
Office, the investigative arm of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The program pays local police and public housing administrators
in 70 cities who in turn pay $50 apiece for guns turned in by
private owners. The program is almost no-questions-asked, and is
intended to get guns off the streets in dangerous neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the 10-month-old program has paid out $3.5 million to
buy back more than 17,000 guns. Most of the weapons were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association and gun control opponents in
Congress attacked the program as wasteful and potentially
dangerous, since it could put cash into criminals' pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton maintains that HUD has clear legal authority to finance
the program, which he contends will help prevent ''an untold number
of gun accidents, suicides and crimes,'' The New York Times
reported in Sunday editions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite HUD's clear authority to carry out this important
program, the gun lobby and other opponents of common-sense gun
safety measures continue to challenge this initiative,'' the Times
quoted Clinton's forthcoming statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh told the newspaper that if the buyback program continued,
housing officials could be fined or even jailed. But he said he may
not seek such penalties.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Bush Gaining Before Convention  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush got more evidence Saturday of
the advantage he's gaining in the polls with the naming of a
running mate and the approaching Republican National Convention,
leading Al Gore by 11 points in one poll and 7 points in another.
</P>
<P>
   The ABC-Washington Post poll released Saturday night showed Bush
with 53 percent and Gore with 42 percent among registered voters.
Bush had a 12-point lead, 49 percent to 37 percent in a four-way
race. Green Party candidate Ralph Nader had 7 percent and Reform
Party hopeful Pat Buchanan had 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The two were tied in that same poll on Monday, before Dick
Cheney was picked as Bush's running mate. Other polls out since the
selection have given Bush a double-digit lead.
</P>
<P>
   A Newsweek poll released Saturday gave Bush a 47 to 40 percent
lead over Gore, with 4 percent opting for Nader and 2 percent for
Buchanan. In a two-way race, Bush leads Gore 49-44, up from a
virtual tie in three Newsweek polls in June.
</P>
<P>
   But Newsweek also found 35 percent of voters saying they might
change their mind before election day.
</P>
<P>
   While 52 percent said Bush's selection of Cheney as his running
mate had not influenced their choice, of those remaining, 26
percent said they were now more inclined to vote for Bush against
only 15 percent who said they were less likely to vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   The ABC-Post poll suggested that public reaction to the
selection of Cheney was generally viewed favorably, though six in
10 said they don't know enough about him to have an opinion.
</P>
<P>
   When they were told of his congressional votes against the Head
Start program, three fourths had an unfavorable response and only a
third reacted favorably when told he was an executive with an oil
company. Democrats are certain to try to paint Cheney negatively
and emphasize votes that are not popular.
</P>
