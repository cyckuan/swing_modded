<P>
"The end of attacks is a positive factor," he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia has from the very start voiced its strongly negative
attitude to the use of force in the solution of the Iraqi problem
and urged the need for using only political and diplomatic methods
in settling the Iraqi crisis, Gutseriyev said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Great Britain are responsible for the death of
Iraq citizens and the suffering of civilians, women and children,

TEHRAN, December 20 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook on Sunday told his Iranian counterpart Kamal Kharrazi
the military strikes against Iraq have been ceased as wished by
Iran.
</P>
<P>
Cook informed Kharrazi of the decision of Britain and the
U.S. at a telephone conversation, the Islamic Republic News
Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi welcomed the stop of the strikes against Iraq, saying
the public opinion in the Muslim states is adamantly against these
operations.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the present crisis will be solved
through diplomatic means and voiced Tehran's readiness to help
bring about a peaceful solution to the Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi made a phone call to Cook Friday night, calling for an
immediate stop of the U.S. and British air and missile strikes
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion, he also said the U.S.-British unilateral
strikes against the Iraqi nation had caused serious concern in the
Muslim world, and Iran, as the OIC chairman, demanded an immediate
halt to the attacks.
</P>
<P>
He also voiced Iran's protest against a stray missile
strike on Iran's southwestern port city of Khorramshahr in
Khuzestan province on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> UK Inflation to Die in 2002: CEBR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The year 2002 will see the end
of the era of relentlessly rising prices in Britain, with the
costs of goods and services falling year on year, according to a
leading economic institute.
</P>
<P>
The Center for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) predicted
that the UK economy is about to plunge into a period of negative
inflation, or deflation, for the first time since the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
It said a recession in the UK will push underlying inflation
down from its present rate of almost 3 percent to 0.1 percent in
2001.
</P>
<P>
The following year, inflation will fall to -0.2 percent, and
then remain below zero, the CEBR added.
</P>
<P>
The institute blamed weak demand for consumer goods, firms
cutting prices to sell off unwanted stock and falling oil and
commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
Janice Clark, an economist of the CEBR, said that once the UK
slips into negative inflation, this is likely to persist for
several years.
</P>
<P>
The CEBR also scaled down its estimate for economic growth in
1999, predicting that it will contract by 0.1 percent. This is
significantly lower than the 0.4 percent growth it predicted for
1999 in its last forecast in September.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Economy Most Unstable: Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Barclays bank Sunday said
Zimbabwe has the most unstable peacetime economy in the southern
African region due to continuously plummeting public and business
confidence.
</P>
<P>
In its Economic Bulletin for December released in Harare, the
bank said most households had become much poorer in the wake of a
more than 100 percent decline in the value of the exchange rate
in local currency terms, while an inflation rate of 45 percent in
November was among the highest in the region.
</P>
<P>
"This under-performance in the real economy while disturbing,
masks a much worse performance in the financial economy and the
balance of payments," Barclays said.
</P>
<P>
"The question is: can a further descent into deep recession be
avoided by arresting the fall in confidence and allowing the
tradable goods sectors to respond to the very tangible export
incentives now in place," the bank's paper said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said if this happens, it would represent the best
case scenario and yield a projected growth rate of around three
percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
But the downside alternatives appeared grim, involving a
decline into substantially negative economic growth and probably
economic "autarky".

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Trying to Contain Malaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The Addis Ababa city
health bureau said Sunday that efforts are underway to contain
malaria epidemic that hit hardly some areas of Ethiopian capital
this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, Sara Emiru, an
official of the city health bureau, said that five residential
councils of the city that were hit hardly by the epidemic were
sprayed with anti-mosquito chemical.
</P>
<P>
She said sewages and other unclean areas have provided a
fertile ground for Mosquito breeding in the areas.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the number of people suffering from
malaria has now decreased.
</P>
<P>
An estimated two million people in Ethiopia are affected by
malaria every year. As a result of changes in weather conditions
this year, traditionally safer areas including Addis Ababa which
is over 2400 meters above sea level, have been hit by malaria.
</P>
<P>
Over 75 percent of the total area of the country is suitable
for mosquito breeding and over 40 million of the total 58 million
population live in the malaria-prone localities.
</P>
<P>
A consignment of anti-malaria medicines donated by the World
Health Organization (WHO) has already arrived at Addis Ababa
airport where it is due to be distributed to all parts of the
country, according to an earlier announcement from the
government.

<HEADLINE> 10,000 Jordanians Stage Anti-U.S. Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Some 10,000 Jordanians staged
protest against the U.S.-British air strikes on Iraq in Amman
Sunday afternoon, and called for lifting the eight-year-old
U.N. sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators, waving flags and chanting slogans, condemned the
attacks on Iraq which came to an end Sunday morning and called the
United Nations to lift what they said unjust sanctions on Iraq
imposed since the 1991 Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
The protesters also blamed the United States for applying
double standards in tackling world issues in the rally, which was
organized by the non-governmental Popular Committee for
Supporting Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government, which had earlier turned down
requests by opposition parities to stage anti-U.S. demonstrations,
apparently gave green light to the protest rallies on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
No clashes were reported so far.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sunday, deputies of the Lower House also condemned the
air attacks on Iraq, called the United Nations to lift its
sanctions on Iraq and send medical teams to Baghdad to treat
the injured.
</P>
<P>
The Jordan government has also called for intensified
diplomatic efforts to put an end to the ongoing Iraqi crisis.

<HEADLINE> Company Privatization Bid Rejected in Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Mines and
Energy of Ethiopia Sunday announced the government's decision to
reject the bid for the privatization of the Kalub Gas Share
Company.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry was quoted by the Ethiopian News Agency as saying
that the Ethiopian government has decided to withdraw the bid for
the sale of its stake in the company because it found the bid
results unsatisfactory.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry said the prices quoted and the terms stated by
the bidders who include four international companies are not
commensurate with those stipulated in the bid document.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian Privatization Agency invited bids earlier this
year for selling off the government's stake in the company. Four
international companies including an American company have bidden
for the competition. However, the prices gave by the four
companies were unsatisfactory to the Ethiopian government.
</P>
<P>
The Kalub Gas Share Company, established in accordance with
the Ethiopian law, aims at tapping the natural gas resources
found in the Ogaden area.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry, a study has confirmed the
availability in the area locally known as Kalub of 68 billion
cubic meters of natural gas and a loan of over 74 million US
dollars has been obtained from the World Bank for the natural gas
project.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry said, the Ethiopian Privatization Agency has been
taking measures to sell off government's stake in the company,
but added that now the company will continue in its present
entity.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Israel's Economic Recession Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Despite various stimulation
measures taken by the government, Israel's economy is expected to
rise by only 1.6 percent in 1998, the lowest in the decade due to
an emerging global economic shrink and a restrictive monetary
policy introduced more than two years ago.
</P>
<P>
The figure, given by Israeli Finance ministry in its latest
report, is based on the country's GDP growth rates in the past
three quarters, namely 1.4 percent in the third quarter, 1.6
percent in the second quarter and 2 percent in the first three
months.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's data also pointed to a remarkable fall in public
consumption and a substantial decline in investments in 1998.
</P>
<P>
From the second quarter to the third quarter of the year,
investments in fixed assets (excluding ships and aircraft) shrank
by 19.4 percent, spending on residential buildings by 13.5 percent
and expenditure in the other sectors by 21.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, the country's per capita consumption,
which is a measure of the individual's living standard, shrank 1
percent. It is the fifth consecutive quarterly decline since last
year, the highest in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, there seems to be few likelihood that the government
meets its target of a 3 percent rise in the state income from
taxes and fees in 1998. Till November, the state income increased
only by 1.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown of Israeli economic growth began in the second
half of 1996 after the Likud government came to power and took a
restrictive monetary policy in order to cool down the then
overheated and inflationary economy.
</P>
<P>
From 1990 to 1995, Israel's annual GDP growth rate was
approximately 6 percent. In comparison, the GDP growth rates in
1996 and 1997 were 4.7 percent and 2.2 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
In addition, local analysts said, the instability of world
financial markets, an abrupt decline in global economic growth and
a sharp reduction in the flow of capital to the developing
countries, have contributed to the downturn in the Israeli
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The government said the country's economic growth was also
hampered by a decreasing number of immigrants to Israel since 1996
and constant terrorism activities in the region as a result of
stagnancy in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The decrease of immigrants led to a halt in the growth of
consumption of durable goods and investment in residential
buildings, while the stagnancy in the peace process raised
economic uncertainty and had an immediate effect on tourism.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the contraction of international trade this year
has led to the recession of Israel's export. The country's export
of goods and services increased by 7.2 percent in 1997, but in
1998 is expected to rise by 3.1 percent only, the lowest growth
rate in the last 15 years.
</P>
<P>
And the country's transition from traditional industries to
high-tech industries has also had a short-term downward effect on
the export growth. The high-tech industries grew rapidly in 1998,
which accounts for more than 30 percent of total export till
now. But the growth in this sector failed to offset the downturn
in export in such sectors as textiles, where the competition from
cheap-labor countries has caused the closure of many Israeli
plants.
</P>
<P>
Israel's local currency shekel has depreciated more than 20
percent against the U.S. dollar in the first 11 months this
year. The devaluation makes the government hard to meet the
target of reducing the inflation rate to 4 percent this year and
the next year.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth slowdown in Israel is likely to cause the
unemployment rate to hit a new high of 8.8 percent in 1998
compared with 7.7 percent in 1997 and 6.7 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In order to get the economy back on a path of high growth, the
Likud government in 1998 continued its economic reforms, including
abolition of foreign-currency restrictions and reduction of its
direct involvement in the economic activities and acceleration of
the privatization of the government corporations.
</P>
<P>
In April 1998, the Finance Ministry announced the lifting of
most of foreign-currency restrictions on Israeli residents and
business sectors in an effort to encourage more foreign investment
in the country's economy and intensify competition in the
financial services.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government succeeded in the late September to
sell 15 percent shares of the state-owned Bank Leumi, Israel's
second largest financial institution, to a variety of local and
foreign investors on the London and Zurich stock exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry said the government's privatization
program in 1998 is surely to make the state-owned enterprises more
efficient, and encourage the Israeli economy to become more
involved in international business.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government has decided to increase investment in
infrastructure by almost 240 million dollars next year in a bid to
boost economic growth and employment. It also plans to allocate 24
million dollars in 1999 to help 30,000 unemployed workers take
part in retraining lessons and get new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said if the economic reforms proceed smoothly in
the country, Israel's economic growth rate is expected to increase
moderately to 2.2-2.5 percent in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone Rebels Capture Diamond City of Koidu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone rebels of the
Revolutionary United Front have captured the diamond city of
Koidu in the east of the country following fierce fightings with
the west African peace-keeping force, ECOMOG, since last
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here Sunday quoted ECOMOG officers in capital
Freetown as saying that "we could have beaten the rebels back but
it would have resulted in the loss of many civilian lives. We
are giving the civilians a few days to leave the town, then we
will strike and crush the rebels."
</P>
<P>
The rebels launched their attacks on Koidu held by the
Nigerian-led ECOMOG troops and the fighting continued until early
Saturday when the ECOMOG troops supported by local Kamajor
traditional hunters pulled back to the outskirts of the town.
</P>
<P>
According to aid workers, thousands of civilians had fled
Koidu toward a northeast town of Makeni and more than 10,000
people have reached Makeni, about 150 kilometers away from Koidu.
</P>
<P>
Koidu used to be Sierra Leone's second biggest city with a
population of about one million until two years ago and the
population has now been reduced to some 100,000 because of the
insecurity after a coup in May 1997 and a ban on diamond mining
imposed by the government of Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG force restored elected President Kabbah to power in
March this year after ousting the junta which ruled the country
from May 1997 to February 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, the rebels of the Revolutionary United Front are
still fighting in many parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Liberian President Charles Taylor Sunday said
that Liberia has closed its borders with Sierra Leone, adding
that the measure was taken to prevent the Sierra Leone violence
from spilling over into Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone has repeatedly accused Liberia of supporting the
rebels loyal to the ousted military government in Sierra Leone.

<P>
MOSCOW, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Russia objects to the turning
of the U.S.-British military action against Iraq into "a rule of
international conduct," Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said
Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
The United Nation should make an assessment of the U.S. and
British missile strikes on Iraq, Ivanov said in an interview with
the Russian Public RTR TV company on the Zerkalo (Mirror) program.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov noted that if no worthy assessment of the move is now
given, if similar actions will not be prevented through possible
efforts in future, such actions can "become a rule of
international conduct." That is the danger of the situation that
shaped up as a result of the new Iraqi crisis, he added.
</P>
<P>
Russia is strongly against such developments around Iraq, said
Ivanov. He said it is no longer a question of Iraq but it is a
global question.
</P>
<P>
"It is not a matter of confrontation, but a matter of future
fundamentals of the world order."
</P>
<P>
"Even in the most complex Cold War times, the U.N. Charter was
unbroken" in contrast to the way it has been broken during the
current Gulf crisis, the minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
The moves of the United States and Great Britain were not
supported in Russia. "They were denounced by all power branches,
everyone spoke from coordinated and firm positions," Ivanov said.

<P>
ANKARA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister
designate Bulent Ecevit returned his mandate for government
formation to President Suleyman Demirel Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Demirel at the presidential palace, Ecevit,
also leader of the Democratic Left Party (DSP), told reporters
that "I told the president that I have been unable to fulfill my
duty."
</P>
<P>
"I have tried all the ways and choices that are
possible except a government formula including the Virtue Party
(FP), " he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Ecevit promised that his party will cooperate with the
new government once it is formed.
</P>
<P>
He said Turkey is confronted with serious problems both at home
and abroad, adding a government should be formed without delay.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Demirel is meeting with political party leaders in
a bid to name another candidate to fulfill the task.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit was assigned by Demirel to form a 56th coalition
government on December 2 following the collapse of the minority
government led by Mesut Yilmaz for his corruption scandal on
November 25.
</P>
<P>
Despite Ecevit's 20-day tour of the political parties in
the parliament, his efforts fell short of coming up with a
government formula that could pass a vote of confidence in the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The True Path Party (DYP) and the Republican People's Party
(CHP) had rejected a proposal for a coalition to be formed by the
Motherland Party (ANAP), the DYP and the DSP, a proposal for the
DSP minority government and another proposal for the broad-based
government.

The Turkish constitution requires a designated prime minister
to form a new government within 45 days.

<HEADLINE> HKFE Successful in Managing Risks in Extreme Volatility in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Futures
Exchange (HKFE) has been successful in 1998 in particular in the
way it managed the risks associated with extreme volatility, HKFE
Chief Executive Randy Gilmore said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The markets have experienced great volatility and large trading
volume in 1998 but the exchange has been successful in ensuring
the safe, fair and orderly operation of the markets, Gilmore said.
</P>
<P>
The volatility of the Hang Seng Index was high, ranging from
the year high so far of 11,810 points on March 25 to the year low
of 6,660 points on August 13.
</P>
<P>
Intra-day volatility of Hang Seng Index futures (spot month) in
1998 up to the present was greatest on February 2 with a range of
1,040 points. The busiest day for the product in the year so far
was May 27 with a total of 73,957 contracts traded.
</P>
<P>
Hang Seng Index futures has continued to be the exchange's
flagship product, with 6,557,760 contracts traded during the year,
up to November 30, 1998, Gilmore said.
</P>
<P>
However, Gilmore said that the biggest achievement for the
exchange in 1998 is the building of the senior management team. He
says that as a result of the management reorganization, the
exchange has recruited talents from different backgrounds to drive
the exchange business.
</P>
<P>
In the forefront of issues facing exchanges all around the
world are the questions of globalization and whether or not they
should change over to screen-based trading, Gilmore said.
</P>
<P>
Upgrading and ensuring the robustness of the Automated Trading
System (ATS) has been the biggest challenge for HKFE in 1998,
Gilmore said. The exchange decided at the end of 1997 to migrate
the Hang Seng Index futures and options contracts to electronic
trading within a 24-month time frame.
</P>
<P>
The advantages of electronic trading are efficiency, an audit
trail and cost effectiveness, Gilmore said. It is also the global
trend, he added.
</P>
<P>
The ATS was first introduced in November 1995 with the launch
of Rolling Forex, a currency futures contract. Since then all new
products have been introduced on the ATS.
</P>
<P>
Today a total of 30 futures and options contracts are traded
electronically. The Hang Seng Index futures and options,
introduced in 1986 and 1993 respectively, will migrate from their
current trading platform - open outcry - to that of the ATS in
1999.

<HEADLINE> Majer Leads Austrian Sweep in World Cup Super-G </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Double Olympic champion
Hermann Maier led a historical Austrian sweep of the top nine
places in Monday's World Cup Super-G at the Patscherkofel course,
Austria.
</P>
<P>
Never before in World Cup history skiers from the same country
had finished 1-9 in men's or women's races, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Maier's victory and the team triumph at the home course which
hosted the 1976 Olympics definitely restored the prestige of
Austrians coming from three consecutive setbacks.
</P>
<P>
Majer clocked an unbeatable time of one minute, 23.52 seconds
down the 1,947-meter long course, dropping 570 meters.
</P>
<P>
Christian Mayer and Fritz Strobl placed second and third
respectively for the all-Austrian podium in the third super giant
slalom race of the season.
</P>
<P>
Mayer trailed the winner by 0.76 seconds. Strobl was one
hundredth of a second back.
</P>
<P>
The race, started 65 minutes late because fog had initially
hampered visibility, looked like the Austrian national
championships as also late starters such Patrick Wirth and Werner
Franz beat skiers from the "rest of the world" for the
sensational 1-9 finish.
</P>
<P>
The previous best team showing dated back to 1968, when French
women finished 1-6 in a downhill race at Abetone, Italy.
</P>
<P>
Maier's third season victory _ the 13th of his World Cup
career - vaulted the strongly-built Austrian skier atop the
overall standings with 540 points after 12 races.
</P>
<P>
Norway's Lasse Kjus, who had entered Monday's race as overall
leader, slipped to second place.
</P>
<P>
The men's World Cup continues at Bormio, northern Italy, with
a downhill on December 29.

Fresno States University in the women's national teams last game
of the year.
</P>
<P>
Despite snow falling for the first time in 37 years in

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 21 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League club
Arsenal captain Tony Adams could be playing again early in the
New Year after getting the green light to start training just
after Christmas.
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old England centre half will have had a clear
one-month break since taking an emergency rest cure for the back
complaint that threatened to end his career.
</P>
<P>
Manager Arsene Wenger is much more optimistic about his team's
chance of retaining the Premiership title as injury problems ease.
</P>
<P>
"Anything is still possible," he said. "Now we are in much
better shape than a few weeks ago after getting most of our
players back.
</P>
<P>
"Tony is nearly ready again. We will not rush him back, but he
saw a specialist on Friday and was told he could start training
next Monday."
</P>
<P>
Wenger said it was possible Adams would be ready in time for
the FA Cup tie at Preston on January 4, but more likely the
following home match against Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
Adams has had a break in Florida and a special epidural
injection to try to clear up the back muscle inflammation which
has bothered him for nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
Last season, he was out from mid-December to late January, but
returned just after Arsenal had begun to turn the corner
following a dismal run of pre-Christmas form.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal's 3-1 victory over Leeds on Sunday ended a similarly
barren spell of five League games without a win.

at the Premiership club's Christmas party on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Neil Ruddock and Trevor Sinclair will appear in court in
Romford, east London, on Tuesday with a third man, youth worker
Richard Nelson.
</P>
<P>
They were arrested Monday night after police went to the

Romford.
</P>
<P>
Ex-England defender Ruddock, 30, of Formby, Liverpool, was

WASHINGTON, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers Monday:
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The White House is seriously weighing a legal assault on the
legitimacy of President Clinton's impeachment by a lame-duck
Congress, arguing that the new House of Representatives that
convenes in January must revisit the matter and approve new
articles before a Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton's senior national security
advisers warned Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on Sunday that the
United States will repeat last week's aerial assault as often as
necessary to prevent Iraq from developing or deploying poison gas
or germ warfare weapons or missiles.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. two parties in the Senate split on issue of whether
President Bill Clinton's pending impeachment trial is mandatory.
</P>
<P>
-- Representative Dennis Hastert has gone suddenly from being
an anonymous middle-level legislator to the presumptive Speaker of
the House, less because of who he is than because of who he is
not.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- President Bill Clinton's impeachment leaves Americans facing
more uncertainty. The president vowed not to resign after the
House approved two articles Saturday.
</P>
<P>
-- The Israeli cabinet approved suspension of West Bank troop
withdrawals as Netanyahu scramble for right-wing support before
today's Knesset vote that is expected to topple his government.

LONDON, December 21 (Xinhua) -- German striker Karlheinz
Riedle could be on the brink of quitting Liverpool in the New
Year.
</P>
<P>
The former Borussia Dortmund star's contract ends in the
summer but he is keen to leave sooner after a lack of first team

</P>
<P>
According to The Mirror newspaper report on Monday, Riedle
said: "I have had enough of being a reserve. I will speak with
the trainer this week about my future.
</P>
<P>
"Depending on how those talks go, we will see where I am after
the Christmas holiday," he told the paper.
</P>
<P>
Riedle has started just one of Liverpool's last ten matches
and was only brought off the bench for two minutes in Saturday's
2-0 win over Sheffield Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Australia, PNG Ministerial Forum Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The 11th annual Australia and
Papua New Guinea (PNG) Ministerial Forum opened in Cairns in
northeast Australia Monday, with the Bougainville conflict, trade
arrangements, cross border security and customs matters high on
the agenda of the two-day talks.
</P>
<P>
At the opening meeting, PNG Foreign Minister Roy Yaki called on
the Australian government to be flexible in the application of aid
money in view of the depressed nature of the PNG economy, the
Australian Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a welcome from Australian Foreign Affairs
Minister Alexander Downer, Yaki said his government accepts the
need for greater accountability in the use of aid dollars, but
feels account must be taken of the combined effects on the PNG
economy of drought, depressed commodity prices and the Asian
currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said PNG was satisfied with the defense relationship between
the two countries, but there were matters of concern regarding the
settlement of the Bougainville conflict.
</P>
<P>
"While we agree with the new objectives of benchmarking and the
performance-driven nature of aid, we would ask Australia to take
due account of the depressed nature of the PNG economy," Yaki
said.
</P>
<P>
Downer said the bilateral relationship was back on track after
a period of uncertainty, and reaffirmed the importance of the
relationship to the Australian government.
</P>
<P>
He said resolution of the Bougainville conflict was high on the
agenda of the talks, pointing to the visits in the past week to
PNG by himself and Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer, and a
forthcoming visit by Defense Minister John Moore.
</P>
<P>
"Minister Moore will have talks with the Peace Monitoring Force
this week, and this and other ministerial visits are part of a
pattern of very useful exchanges," Downer said.
</P>
<P>
"There used to be a time when the personal relationship between
Australian and PNG ministers was very important," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking forward to a very constructive meeting on the
bilateral arrangements which the Australian government believes is
crucial."

<P>
XINING, December 21 (Xinhua) -- A six-year-old boy kidnapped ten
days ago has been rescued by police in China's northwest Qinghai
Province and four migrant workers have been charged with the
abduction.
</P>
<P>
The boy is now back with his parents after more than 300
police scoured the area and the three adjacent provinces of Gansu,
Shaanxi and Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
The drama unfolded when Zhou Genlan, a private businessman
from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, found his son Zhou
Jiang missing on December 2 and reported the case to the police
the next day.
</P>
<P>
The police discovered that the boy had been kidnapped by Hu
Guoqing and three other migrant workers from central Henan
Province.
</P>
<P>
Three days later, on December 5, Zhou received a telephone
call from Hu, demanding a ransom of 170,000 yuan (about 21,000 US
dollars) for the boy.
</P>
<P>
While Zhou and his wife handed the money to the four kidnappers
in Leshan in southwest China's Sichuan Province, policemen who had
hidden nearby jumped out and arrested the gang, who were also
armed with three home-made handguns.

<HEADLINE> Bank Savings Still Favored in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 21 (Xinhua) --Despite the People's Bank of
China cutting interest rates six times this year, the Chinese
still save over ten percent of their salaries in banks
each month, according to sources from the State Information Center.
</P>
<P>
This is higher than the average savings level for the Asian and
Pacific Region but it seems the Chinese people would like to save
more.
</P>
<P>
The Center was quoting the results of a survey released
recently by Master Card International, which examined savings and
consumer spending in the region overall.
</P>
<P>
It discovered that many Chinese residents are not satisfied
with their present savings level, comparing it unfavorably with
that of their Japanese neighbours.
</P>
<P>
However, after the People's Bank of China slashed interest
rates again recently financial observers reckon it will be hard to
tell if this will affect the levels of savings in the country.
</P>
<P>
The survey, which was first initiated in 1996, is carried out
in 13 countries and areas of the Asian and Pacific Region every
six months, with an admitted error rate of four percent. The
latest survey covered China's Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou
cities.
</P>
<P>
Most of those polled feel they do not save enough, and only 34
percent are satisfied with the amount they presently save.
</P>
<P>
Many people said that their savings are used for a wide range
of purposes such as the education of children, buying houses,
medical insurance and holidays.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, for many Chinese people buying houses has become one
of the main reasons for saving, thanks to the implementation of
housing reform policies in China over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
And 63 percent of Chinese respondents said they would spend the
money on their parents.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows, however, that few Chinese residents would
spend their savings on foreign holidays which are still considered
to be a luxury, afforded by only a small number of people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Asian financial crisis has had a dramatic impact
on consumer spending habits in the Asian and Pacific Region. More
than 70 percent of those interviewed acknowledged that they are
now more careful in their spending because of the difficult
economic situation.
</P>
<P>
However, due to the limited impact of the crisis in China, only
47 percent of those polled in the three main cities said they had
became more careful over spending.

<HEADLINE> Newcastle Shareholders Reject Directors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 21 (Xinhua) -- A fiery annual meeting of
Newcastle United football club witnessed shareholders reject the
reinstatement of disgraced directors Freddie Shepherd and Douglas
Hall to the board on Monday.
</P>
<P>
A clear majority on the floor of the meeting opposed their
re-election in a show-of-hands vote forcing chief executive
Freddie Fletcher to call a formal poll of all shareholders.
</P>
<P>
However, with Shepherd and Hall themselves major
shareholders,this vote is expected to approve their re-elction.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, shareholders and fans were told that nothing will
happen regarding any proposed takeover until early next spring at
the soonest.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Newcastle admitted that it had struck a deal for a
potential sale of the club to US cable group NTL which
immediately took an initial 6.3% stake in the Magpies.
</P>
<P>
The meeting erupted a number of times with Fletcher forced to
repeatedly call for order as shareholders hurled abuse at the
podium. Several shareholders shouted "it's a stitch-up" over the
re-election issue.
</P>
<P>
The two disgraced directors who own a majority share of the
club were able to vote themselves back onto the board of the
football club earlier this month sparking the resignations of the
chairman and financial advisor.
</P>
<P>
The two had been forced out in July following their
disparaging remarks about Newcastle fans and leading player Alan
Shearer.
</P>
<P>
About 500 fans watched the latest meeting via a video link-up
to homeground St James' Park.
</P>
<P>
Long-time Newcastle supporter Ted Ablett, 70, said: "I have
supported this club since the 1940s and we need some stability
here.At present it is a shambles and I don't know what input we
can have this morning."
</P>
<P>
Shareholders of the stock exchange-listed Premier League club
are also expected to reject the proposed 160 million pounds
takeover by NTL.
</P>
<P>
An understanding leaves NTL, the UK's third largest
telecommunications and cable company, free to buy the rest of
Hall's shares and therefore a controlling stake in the club.
</P>
<P>
However, Fletcher told the meeting: "No offer has been made at
the moment and if one is, then full advice will be given to
shareholders at that time."
</P>
<P>
The cable group has said there would be no agreement on the
takeover bid until the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, the
UK's anti-competition watchdog, has approved of the takeover bid
of Manchester United by media group BSkyB.

<HEADLINE> Euro Zone Enjoys Trade Surplus in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The euro zone enjoyed a trade
surplus of 5.2 billion ECU (6.24 billion U.S. dollars) in
September with the rest of the world, Eurostat reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Luxembourg-based statistical bureau of the European
community said that though the 11 euro countries enjoyed a
combined surplus, the surplus dropped 2.2 billion ECU (2.64
billion dollars) compared with the same month a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The European Union, however, fared even worse in September when
the 15-nation bloc sustained a trade deficit of 1.2 billion ECU
(1.44 billion dollars) with non-EU countries.
</P>
<P>
Twelve months ago, the European Union chalked up a surplus of
3.3 billion ECU (3.96 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The extra- and intra-trade growth continued to slow in
September for both the European Union and the euro zone.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Turkey-Syria Disputes Abate, Not End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The Kurdish issue had long been
at the heart of the bitterness between Turkey and Syria, and this
October it flared up to push the two neighboring countries to the
brink of war.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to mediation efforts by regional countries and
self-restraint the two sides exercised, a weeks-long standoff
ended peacefully, sparing the conflict-stricken region of possibly
another catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's relations with Syria fared badly, primarily due to
alleged Damascus support to the Kurdish Workers' Party, a rebel
group outlawed in Turkey, Turkey's newly-founded alliance with
Israel, and the long-standing dispute over water resources.
</P>
<P>
Ankara threatened to resort to force if Damascus continues to
support the PKK, which has been fighting for autonomy in
southeastern Turkey. Some 37,000 people have been killed in the
14-year-old conflict.
</P>
<P>
Turkey intensified its pursuit of the guerrillas in and outside
its territory in recent years, hoping to root out the rebellion.
However, its military goal could not be fully attained because the
militants could always find shelter, as alleged, in Syria, Iraq
and Iran, who showed sympathy to the Kurdish movement.
</P>
<P>
At the parliament on October 1, Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel warned that his country reserved the right to respond
against Syria for Damascus' support to the PKK.
</P>
<P>
Then Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said later that his government
might request a parliament consent for a war with Syria, although
war was not desired.
</P>
<P>
Turkey massed troops, tanks and artillery near Syria and
ordered fighter planes to take off from southern air bases and fly
at low-altitude along the common border, to substantiate its
threat.
</P>
<P>
This was when Egypt and Iran came to the rescue. Together with
other Arab states, they urged for reason, self-restraint, and a
peaceful approach to sort out the differences. Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak shuttled between Ankara and Damascus in early
October and Iran sent its Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi to talk
the two sides into a dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The mediation worked. High-ranking officials from Turkey and
Syria held crucial talks on October 19-20 in the southern Turkish
city of Ceyhan not far from the Syrian border, and cut a deal.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement reached, Syria pledged to shut down PKK
camps on its territory and in the Syrian-controlled Bekka valley
in Lebanon, and to prevent PKK militants from launching
cross-border attacks on Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey also achieved what it wished for: to dislodge PKK leader
Abdullah Ocalan out of Syria, and possibly this region.
</P>
<P>
Despite the peaceful solution to this row, Turkey's rift with
Syria and other countries in the region, who resented Ankara's
growingly close ties with Israel, seemed to be widening.
</P>
<P>
Syria, located between Turkey and Israel, said Turkish-Israeli
military alliance is targeted against the Arab world, especially
itself. It accused the predominantly Muslim, but politically
secular neighbor of betraying the interests of the Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, Turkey and Israel signed a couple of
military training and defense industry cooperation accords, much
to the rancor and animosity of its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Most Arab countries in the region still regarded Israel as a
threat to their peace and security, particularly at a time when
the Middle East peace process was stalled because of what they
called Israeli intransigence.
</P>
<P>
They feared that closer Turkish-Israeli military alliance would
further tip the balance of power in the region greatly in Israel's
favor.
</P>
<P>
Turkey argued that their relationship was of totally bilateral
nature and not directed at any third country, blaming Syria for
inciting the Arab world to confront Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the lingering problem of water sharing is
re-surfacing. The Euphrates and Tigris rivers both originate in
the mountains of Turkey and run down through Syria and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
For years, Syria and Iraq have complained Turkey did not allow
more water to flow downstream; now Syria is accusing Ankara of
building more dams on the Euphrates that would further jeopardize
its water supply.
</P>
<P>
In the past, late Turkish President Turgut Ozal had threatened
to use water as a kind of "weapon" to force Syria to withdraw
support for the Kurds by "restricting the water flow" to Syria.
</P>
<P>
Now that the Kurdish issue is resolved, at least for now, will
the "weapon" itself become a next flash point between the two
neighbors in the future? It's anybody's guess.

MANILA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
start its overhaul of the national sports development program
early next year following what officials has described as the
country's "worse performance" ever in an Asian sports contest.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines News Agency Monday quoted Executive Secretary
Ronaldo Zamora of the government as saying the new sports
development program will focus on schools as the primary venue
for developing international competitors.
</P>
<P>
"The result (in the Asian Games) is that we end up at the
bottom in international competition. This is the worst
performance we ever had in any international competition in
Asia," Zamora said
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, Philippine President Joseph Estrada expressed
disappointment over the country's sports development program
following the Philippines' dismal performance in the 13th Asian
Games in Bangkok, Thailand, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
He described the Philippine contingents' performances as "very
disappointing".
</P>
<P>
The Philippines earned only one gold medal from billiards in
the 13th Asian Games.

<HEADLINE> 12 Foreign Firms Engage in Mining in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has attracted 12
foreign firms to engage in its mining sector since the country
enacted the New Mining Law in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The firms from Australia, Canada, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore,
Thailand and the United States are engaged in prospecting and
exploration of mineral resources such as gold and copper.
</P>
<P>
The firms have signed agreements with Myanmar on mineral
prospecting and exploration, and eight of them have formed joint
ventures with enterprises under the Myanmar Ministry of Mines.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar Ivanhoe Copper Co. Ltd. between Myanmar and Canada
is one of such joint ventures, which produces cathode copper from
Sabai Taung and Kyay Sin Taung mines.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, plans are underway to develop the Let Pan Taung
copper mine and upon completion, the copper mine will become one
of the largest mine of its kind in the area.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, foreign investment in
Myanmar's mining sector amounted to 501.36 million U.S. dollars in
43 related projects at the end of May this year.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics also show that the output value of
Myanmar's mining sector rose 1.5 percent in the 1997-98 fiscal
year which ended in March as compared with the previous year.

<HEADLINE> HK Sports Chief Praises "Behind-the-Scenes Hero" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 21 (Xinhua) -- While praising the success
obtained by athletes of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) at the 13th Asian Games in Bangkok, the head of the
Amateur Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, Chi
na, reminded people here on Monday not to forget those behind the
successful athletes.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony held at the Hong Kong International
Airport to welcome the return of the Hong Kong SAR delegation
from the Bangkok Games, Timothy Fok said that the greatest glory
should be given to the triumphant SAR athletes, who had made
painstaking efforts for achieving their goals at the December
6-20 Games.
</P>
<P>
For example, Nanquan (Southern Boxing) champion Ng Siu Ching
had trained in Beijing for three months for her title-winning
Wushu performance of just one minute and 20 seconds in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Fok also noted the fruitful efforts by Shen Jinkang, coach of
Hong Kong SAR cyclist Wong Kam Po, who won the men's
200-kilometer individual road race in Bangkok. Shen, a former
head coach of China's national cycling team, has been the head
coach of Hong Kong cyclists since 1994. Finishing fourth at the
road race in the Hiroshima Asian Games the same year, Wong
gradually took Asia's top spot under the instruction of the
former Chinese national coach.
</P>
<P>
Fok also promised to make efforts in trying to have
post-career arrangements made for retired athletes, which was a
focal point raised by many of Hong Kong SAR's Asian Games medal
winners.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's first ever Asian Games gold medal came when Che
Kok Hom took the women's blowing title at the Seoul Games in
1986. Olympic champion windsurfer Lee Lai Shan took for Hong
Kong its second Asian Games title 12 years later, this time in
Bangkok, where SAR athletes competed for the time under the name
of Hong Kong, China.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong SAR athletes grabbed five gold, six silver and six
bronze medals at Bangkok, which represented the best ever
performance by any Hong Kong delegations at Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
The SAR Government had planned to hold celebrations on
Wednesday, including open bus ride by Asian Games medal winners
and song and dance performance by local artists at a square in
eastern Tsim Sha Tsui. The Hong Kong Sports Development Board
had set cash prizes for the medal winners at the Bangkok Games,
with gold medal winners each to take 500,000 HK dollars (64,100
U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Nigeria, Mali to Set up Joint Trade Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria and Mali have agreed to
form a high joint commission to boost commercial activities and
promote cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued at the end of a visit to Mali Saturday by
Nigerian Head of State General Abdulsalami Abubakar said that a
constitutive session of the commission would be held at the
earliest possible time, New Nigerian newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
General Abubakar and President Omar Alpha Konare of Mali
agreed to intensify periodical sectorial meetings at all levels
in order to promote mutual cooperation between the people of
Nigeria and Mali.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the objectives
and principles of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS), saying that an effective bilateral and regional
cooperation among the ECOWAS member states is a necessary
prerequisite for regional economic integration.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria and Mali, both are ECOWAS members, are committed to
the use of dialogue and consultation in resolving conflicts and
to the maintenance of peace and security in the sub-region, the
communique said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders reiterated their support to the ECOWAS peace
plan on Guinea Bissau, the restoration of peace in Liberia and
the constitutional government in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
On other continental issues, they regretted the persistence of
hot beds in the Great Lakes region, Angola, Guinea Bissau, Sierra
Leone and the Comoros.
</P>
<P>
They called on member states of the Organization of African
Unity to take necessary measures to ensure effective economic
cooperation among African countries.

<HEADLINE> "Desert Fox" Action Dismissed By Chinese Military Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese military experts have
dismissed the U.S. and British four day action against Iraq as a
"Much Ado About Nothing" scenario, to quote the famous British
playwright William Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and British governments insist that the operation known
as 'Desert Fox' achieved what they wanted.
</P>
<P>
However, Chen Bojiang, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of
Military Science, points out that the U.S. and British governments
made it clear that one of the major objectives of the action was
to overthrow Saddam Hussein's regime.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously Saddam's throne has not been threatened and any
anti-government action in Iraq is still in its infancy," added
Chen.
</P>
<P>
Another objective was to destroy Iraq's facilities for
producing weapons of mass destruction and the long-range cruise
missiles launched to demolish his installations outnumbered those
in the Gulf War seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
"However, the percentage of accurate hits was quite limited
according to an assessment by even both sides," points out Zhang
Yuliang, a professor at the Chinese Institute of National Defense.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, he said that the real, and hidden, agenda of the
U.S. and British governments is to take control of oil resources
in the Middle East in order to maintain their strategic advantage
in the region.
</P>
<P>
However, after the action, the two governments have faced severe
criticism and denunciation from both their adversaries and even
their friends. More important for the future, is the potential
threat of the wrath of the whole Muslim world in view of the
proximity to the holy term of Ramadan before the attacks
commenced, and which largely contributed to a relatively quick
ending of the engagement.
</P>
<P>
The two Chinese experts also believe that the Operation "Desert
Fox" has undeniable connections with U.S. President Bill Clinton's
personal domestic embarrassment. Despite the seriousness of the
military action in terms of international relations, and the
temporary postponement of a vote for impeachment due to the sudden
and surprise attacks on Iraq, the U.S. House of Representatives
still voted to pass two articles calling for Clinton's impeachment
during the same week of the attacks.
</P>
<P>
It is suggested that Clinton's hope of "killing two birds with
one stone" finally ended in disillusionment on both counts.

<HEADLINE> Nepali King Accepts PM's Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Nepali King Birendra
accepted Monday evening the resignation tendered by Prime Minister
Girija Prasad Koirala, Radio Nepal said.
</P>
<P>
The king asked the present government to continue its function
until a new government is formed, the state-run radio said,
quoting a notice issued by the king's Principal Press Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
He also asked any member of the Lower House who can garner a
majority of 103 seats to stake claim to power by Wednesday
evening, another notice issued by the secretariat said.
</P>
<P>
When Koirala tendered his resignation earlier Monday, he also
submitted to the king a letter bearing the signatures of
legislators from three parties supporting his premiership in the
coalition government to be formed.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear how many legislators had signed the letter,
but the three parties -- the ruling Nepali Congress (NC), the main
opposition Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxism-Leninism,
CPN-UML) and the Nepal Sadbhavana Party -- have a majority of 140
seats in the house, much more than needed to form a new coalition.
</P>
<P>
Koirala resigned in accordance with a decision of the NC
Central Working Committee and an agreement the NC reached Sunday
with the CPN-UML.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML agreed to support the efforts of the NC in forming
a new coalition government to conduct general elections in April
1999.
</P>
<P>
The two parties agreed to include all the political parties
represented in parliament into the new government to be headed by
Koirala.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of political turmoil erupted when the
Communist Party of Nepal (Marxism-Leninism, CPN-ML) quit the
coalition government on December 10 after sharing power with the
NC for three and a half months.
</P>
<P>
The party alleged that the NC had failed to implement the
agreements reached with it and other left parties in August.
</P>
<P>
It registered a no-confidence motion on Sunday against the NC
government with the support of other parties.
</P>
<P>
King Birendra had decided to call a special session of
parliament on Thursday to discuss the motion, which becomes
meaningless with the resignation of Prime Minister Koirala.
</P>
<P>
Koirala's government is the fifth in the country since the
mid-term polls in November 1994 which produced a hung parliament
with no single party holding a majority.

<HEADLINE> Two Ministers Approved in Mongolian Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia's Great Hural on
Monday approved the nominations of Nyam-Osorin Tuyaa as the
external relations minister and Sonomtserengiin Mendsaikhan as the
environmental minister.
</P>
<P>
Another seven candidates in a nine-member list for
corresponding ministerial posts submitted by the Prime Minister
Janlaviin Narantsatsralt last week failed to receive approval.
</P>
<P>
According to the information agency for the Great Hural, the
40-year-old Tuyaa, a member of the National Democratic Party
(NDP), worked as the chief of an agency in the external relations
ministry before the nomination. And 38-year-old Mendsaikhan, a
member of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), was a former
political consultant for the chairman of the Great Hural
Radnaasumberel Gonchigdorj.
</P>
<P>
Mongolian ruling parties, the NDP and the SDP, finalized nine
ministerial candidates after Narantsatsralt was named as the prime
minister on December 9 and asked him to submit the list to the
Great Hural. Since seven candidates failed to receive approval,
the objectives of a new government will be rather difficult to
ascertain in a country which has been suffering a political crisis
for more than four months.

<HEADLINE> Fighting in Angola's Kuito City Dies Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The fighting in Kuito City,
provincial capital of Angola's central Bie Province has died
down, the government-run Journal of Angola newspaper reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kuito has been the center where the most fierce fighting took
place since mid November between the government troops and the
forces of the opposition National Union for Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, UNITA President Jonas Savimbi's troops
stopped bombarding and only sporadic shootings were heard after
the government forces launched a counter attack against the
rebels surrounding the city.
</P>
<P>
The reinforced government troops launched massive attacks on
the town of Cruzeiro, 35 kilometers south of Kuito, releasing the
pressure upon the defenders.
</P>
<P>
However, the paper acknowledged that it is still too early to
say that Kuito has been rescued from the siege by the UNITA
troops since the routes linking the city with the outside world
are still controlled by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
UNITA reinforcements are reported to have massed toward Kuito,
apparently preparing to mount new attacks on the city.
</P>
<P>
There have been big-scale conflicts again between the
government army and the UNITA forces in the central provinces of
Huambo and Bie in the past month and more.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government accused the UNITA of launching attacks
first by using tanks, armored vehicles, long-range artillery and
surface-to-air missiles.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA has got the upper hand by occupying most parts of
the two provinces of Huambo and Bie and the Angolan government
army has to retreat so as to defend the capital cities of the two
provinces.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Israel's Economic Recession Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Despite various stimulation
measures taken by the government, Israel's economy is expected to
rise by only 1.6 percent in 1998, the lowest in the decade due to
an emerging global economic shrink and a restrictive monetary
policy introduced more than two years ago.
</P>
<P>
The figure, given by Israeli Finance ministry in its latest
report, is based on the country's GDP growth rates in the past
three quarters, namely 1.4 percent in the third quarter, 1.6
percent in the second quarter and 2 percent in the first three
months.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's data also pointed to a remarkable fall in public
consumption and a substantial decline in investments in 1998.
</P>
<P>
From the second quarter to the third quarter of the year,
investments in fixed assets (excluding ships and aircraft) shrank
by 19.4 percent, spending on residential buildings by 13.5 percent
and expenditure in the other sectors by 21.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, the country's per capita consumption,
which is a measure of the individual's living standard, shrank 1
percent. It is the fifth consecutive quarterly decline since last
year, the highest in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, there seems to be few likelihood that the government
meets its target of a 3 percent rise in the state income from
taxes and fees in 1998. Till November, the state income increased
only by 1.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown of Israeli economic growth began in the second
half of 1996 after the Likud government came to power and took a
restrictive monetary policy in order to cool down the then
overheated and inflationary economy.
</P>
<P>
From 1990 to 1995, Israel's annual GDP growth rate was
approximately 6 percent. In comparison, the GDP growth rates in
1996 and 1997 were 4.7 percent and 2.2 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
In addition, local analysts said, the instability of world
financial markets, an abrupt decline in global economic growth and
a sharp reduction in the flow of capital to the developing
countries, have contributed to the downturn in the Israeli
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The government said the country's economic growth was also
hampered by a decreasing number of immigrants to Israel since 1996
and constant terrorism activities in the region as a result of
stagnancy in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The decrease of immigrants led to a halt in the growth of
consumption of durable goods and investment in residential
buildings, while the stagnancy in the peace process raised
economic uncertainty and had an immediate effect on tourism.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the contraction of international trade this year
has led to the recession of Israel's export. The country's export
of goods and services increased by 7.2 percent in 1997, but in
1998 is expected to rise by 3.1 percent only, the lowest growth
rate in the last 15 years.
</P>
<P>
And the country's transition from traditional industries to
high-tech industries has also had a short-term downward effect on
the export growth. The high-tech industries grew rapidly in 1998,
which accounts for more than 30 percent of total export till
now. But the growth in this sector failed to offset the downturn
in export in such sectors as textiles, where the competition from
cheap-labor countries has caused the closure of many Israeli
plants.
</P>
<P>
Israel's local currency shekel has depreciated more than 20
percent against the U.S. dollar in the first 11 months this
year. The devaluation makes the government hard to meet the
target of reducing the inflation rate to 4 percent this year and
the next year.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth slowdown in Israel is likely to cause the
unemployment rate to hit a new high of 8.8 percent in 1998
compared with 7.7 percent in 1997 and 6.7 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In order to get the economy back on a path of high growth, the
Likud government in 1998 continued its economic reforms, including
abolition of foreign-currency restrictions and reduction of its
direct involvement in the economic activities and acceleration of
the privatization of the government corporations.
</P>
<P>
In April 1998, the Finance Ministry announced the lifting of
most of foreign-currency restrictions on Israeli residents and
business sectors in an effort to encourage more foreign investment
in the country's economy and intensify competition in the
financial services.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government succeeded in the late September to
sell 15 percent shares of the state-owned Bank Leumi, Israel's
second largest financial institution, to a variety of local and
foreign investors on the London and Zurich stock exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry said the government's privatization
program in 1998 is surely to make the state-owned enterprises more
efficient, and encourage the Israeli economy to become more
involved in international business.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government has decided to increase investment in
infrastructure by almost 240 million dollars next year in a bid to
boost economic growth and employment. It also plans to allocate 24
million dollars in 1999 to help 30,000 unemployed workers take
part in retraining lessons and get new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said if the economic reforms proceed smoothly in
the country, Israel's economic growth rate is expected to increase
moderately to 2.2-2.5 percent in 1999.

<HEADLINE> EPO Problem to Be Solved within Two Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Cycling's drug-testers will
solve the problem of the banned performance-enhancer EPO within
the next two years, International Cycling Union (UCI) president
Hein Verbruggen said in Marseille, France, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The optimistic forecast was tempered by a warning about the
emergence of new impossible-to-detect substances.
</P>
<P>
"I think that in the next two years we will be able to detect
EPO, but I'm worried about new products which we can't catch,"
Verbruggen was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
In the interview with French newspaper La Provence, Verbruggen
raised the question of a rift between the UCI and the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) over the question of
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
"The IOC considers the minimum sanction should be for two
years for the first (drug) infringement and for life in case of a
repeat. But for a cyclist two years represents a life ban," he
said.

<HEADLINE> One of China's Greatest Scholars Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 21 (Xinhua) -- There was a quiet cremation
here today for Qian Zhongshu who passed away two days ago, and who
is regarded by many as one of China's greatest writers and
scholars of this century.
</P>
<P>
A graduate of Qinghua University and Britain's Oxford
University, the 88-year old intellectual was known for his efforts
to interweave Western and Eastern cultures.
</P>
<P>
His most famous novel "The Besieged City", depicts the ideas,
hopes and aspirations of Chinese intellectuals. He was also
respected for his collections of literary critiques. During the
chaotic "Cultural Revolution" (1966-76), he was one of the most
well-known intellectuals who were persecuted.
</P>
<P>
At his own request, the funeral ceremony was very simple
without any music and his body was carried in a mini-bus to the
Babaoshan Cemetery for Revolutionaries in Beijing accompanied by
his 87 year old widow Yang Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Present at the ceremony were only twenty other mourners,
including Li Tieying, a member of the political bureau of the
Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and president of the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Yang placed a small basket of flowers on her husband's body
before it was cremated. In accordance with his will, his ashes
will not be preserved and none of his friends or students had been
invited to the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The couple were highly regarded in China for their wisdom,
commitment to each other, humility and disregard for wealth.
</P>
<P>
Last night Yang received a telephone message of condolence
from Chinese president Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
Many of Qian's contemporaries believe that he was truly
representative of the times.
</P>
<P>
One of his grieving colleagues admitted that if the funeral had
been public probably thousands of people might have attended to
pay their last respects to the man many considered a master.

<HEADLINE> People's Bank of China Gets Tough on Ownership Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China
(PBOC) today issued a circular demanding state-owned medium-sized
and small enterprises and collectively-owned firms to closely
monitor and administer creditor's rights when undergoing ownership
transformation.
</P>
<P>
It stated that this is to standardize the ownership
transformation of enterprises and prevent financial risks.
</P>
<P>
The protection of financial claims is crucial to preventing
financial risks and promoting economic and financial development
and social stability, the bank stressed.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that there have been cases in which some
enterprises have tried to evade paying off their bank debt during
the process of their restructuring, but in fact this practice only
harmed their credit rating with banks.
</P>
<P>
Relevant departments have been instructed to improve their
responsibility, and realize the importance of protecting financial
claims. They have also been told to correctly handle the
administration of enterprise transformation while ensuring the
protection of financial claims.
</P>
<P>
The bank has asked departments in charge of enterprise
transformation to carefully study and examine enterprise
transformation plans and closely supervise their
implementation. Enterprises undergoing ownership transformation
must solve issues related to financial claims according to
existing laws and policies, while financial institutions, as major
creditors, must be invited to participate in the changeover.
</P>
<P>
The bank's circular highlights and details just what
constitutes enterprise ownership transformation: share-holding
restructuring, mergers, auctions and transference of assets,
leasing and contracting, joint-venture restructuring and
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
The bank has also insisted that all fiscal, taxation and
industrial and commercial administration departments strengthen
their supervision on the procedures of enterprise transformation,
in a bid to stop losses of state-owed assets and taxes. It calls
for severe punishments for enterprises which have evaded their
financial responsibilities.

<HEADLINE> Year-Ender: Angolan Peace Process Faltering Into </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The rumbling of gunfire has
shattered the hope of the implementation of Angolan peace
process, which should have been concluded this year in the
southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Since early December, fierce fighting in central Angola
between the government forces and the rebel troops of the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) has
resulted in the death of hundreds of people, while some 100,000
people have been forced to flee their homes.
</P>
<P>
As heavy weapons like tanks, long-range artillery and
surface-to-air missiles were used in the battles, Angolan Foreign
Minister Venancio da Silva Moura said last week that "the Angolan
peace process is at a crucial point and a full-scale civil war
may break out at any moment."
</P>
<P>
This is, no doubt, a failure to comply with the Lusaka
Protocol which aims at a lasting peace in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka peace accord signed in the Zambian capital in 1994
is a landmark which has ended two decades of civil war between
the government and UNITA and unfolded a new initiative for peace
efforts.
</P>
<P>
Three years after the agreement, a unified armed force and a
government of national unity and reconciliation have been formed,
with UNITA members formally sworn in in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, at the critical point of the Lusaka Protocol, UNITA
was reluctant to fully demobilize its army and refused to hand
over several key areas it occupies to the government as
prescribed in the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that the move indicates Jonas Savimbi,
Chairman of UNITA, and his supporters would not let go of the
"assets" they accumulated over the past 30 years. Moreover, the
protracted civil war has deprived the two sides of any trust of
each other. Now that the People's Liberation Movement of Angola
takes the state power in its hand, the UNITA could hardly imagine
assuming the role of "political opposition" under the roof of its
long-time foe.
</P>
<P>
Hence the peace process ran into a stalemate, with domestic
conflicts escalating and frequent maneuver of UNITA military
forces in an attempt to attack government controlled cities,
bringing the country to the fringes of crisis.
</P>
<P>
The death of U.N. special envoy to Angola, Alioune Blondin
Beye, in a plane accident forced the mediation work which Beye
had been so competent with to a virtual standstill. The Angolan
government, in despair, decided to deal a strong blow to Savimbi
who it believes is determined to wage an "armed struggle for
state power."
</P>
<P>
On September 1, the government announced the suspension of
UNITA members' positions in the government of national unity and
reconciliation as well as the parliament, forcing most of them to
express their willingness to stick to the peace process and
desert Savimbi by forming a splinter UNITA Renovation Committee.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government accused Savimbi of being "a war
criminal" and broke up all its contacts with the former rebel
movement. Instead, it recognized the UNITA Renovation Committee
as the only legitimate dialogist over the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The move, by causing division inside the opposition UNITA and
assuming the legality to "wipe out the armed bandits of Savimbi"
actually kills two birds with one stone.

<HEADLINE> Year-Ender: Angolan Peace Process Faltering Into </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
However, the move was not agreed to by the United Nations
mediators, who believe that despite the obstacles set up by
Savimbi to the peace process, Savimbi should be allowed one more
chance given the fact that he is one of the two signatories of
the Lusaka Protocol.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council in October, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said there had been "some negative
changes" recently in the Angolan situation, which "pose serious
threats to further advancing the peace process."
</P>
<P>
The words aroused strong complaints from the Angolan
government. Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos said in his
letter to Annan that "it has been proved by history many times
that Savimbi will not give up his war policy," and that Angolan
people are determined to "completely cast him aside" and
accomplish the rest of the tasks prescribed in the Lusaka peace
agreement together with the "patriotic UNITA Renovation
Committee."
</P>
<P>
The differences between Angolan government and the United
Nations worsened the situation in the peace process. U.N. new
envoy to Angola Issa Diallo could hardly start working since he
took office in late August.
</P>
<P>
Neither has the joint committee which consists of U.N., the
Angolan government, UNITA and the troika observer countries --
Portugal, Russia and the United States -- opened any session
since.
</P>
<P>
With escalating domestic conflicts, the government army
launched attacks at UNITA occupied areas in central Angola in
mid-November, and besieged Bailundo and Andulo, where UNITA
headquarters are located.
</P>
<P>
UNITA, on the other hand, held about 15 U.N. peacekeepers as
virtual hostages. There were reports that UNITA had withdrawn
its main force to forest areas in the east, getting prepared for
long-time war with the backup of diamond resources in the Lunda
provinces.
</P>
<P>
To rid the war-torn country of deteriorating crisis, serious
negotiations were then held between the U.N. representative and
the Angolan government.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council approved a resolution on December 3,
citing the failure to implement Lusaka peace accord by the UNITA
leadership as the main cause for the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The resolution asked UNITA to demobilize its army
unconditionally and withdraw its forces from areas it took over
from the government.
</P>
<P>
It also urged UNITA to cooperate with the government
completely in a bid to promote the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council also renewed the mandate of its
peacekeepers in Angola for another three months in an effort to
prevent a return to war in the southern African nation.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government expressed its "satisfaction" toward the
resolution. However, it is still far from a compromised stand
accepted by both sides.
</P>
<P>
The recent armed clashes in central Angola which witnessed
dozens of tanks and long-range cannons on the UNITA side had been
reportedly a great setback to the government army.
</P>
<P>
According to local press reports that UNITA's Chairman Jonas
Savimbi, who was planning to announce victory on December 25, the
founding day of his party, had to start his action on December 1,
after the government became aware of UNITA's conspiracy and made
response to it.
</P>
<P>
The government and UNITA troops are now engaging in fierce
fightings in the central part of the country, where UNITA men
have taken control of a big part of Huambo and Bie provinces,
while the government forces have withdrawn to Huambo and Kuito,
capital cities of the two provinces after suffering heavy losses.
</P>
<P>
All signs indicate that the two sides are really in for it,
and therefore, currently there seems to be no end in sight to the
Angolan peace process.

produces most of Australia's rice in the Murray and Murrumbidgee
areas. In recent years Australian rice has made inroads into the
Japanese market with new rice strains such as Japonica and
Koshihikari developed specifically for that market.
</P>
<P>
Carr said he had written to Deputy Prime Minister and Minister
for Trade Tim Fischer to ask him to "do everything in his power"
to protect the Australian rice industry.
</P>
<P>
"I strongly urge the deputy prime minister to make the
strongest representations to the Japanese... they must not
proceed with plans to impose a tariff on imported rice," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said Tim Fischer had already contacted with the
U.S. trade representative talking about a joint action against
Japanese tariffs.

<HEADLINE> HK Consumer Price Indices for November 1998 Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's consumer price
inflation, as indicated by the year-on-year rate of change in the
composite Consumer Price Index (CPI), registered a decline of 0.7
percent in November, compared with a small increase of 0.1 percent
in October.
</P>
<P>
According to the CPI figures for November 1998 released Monday
by the Census and Statistics Department, analyzed by sub-index and
on a year-on-year comparison, the CPI(A), CPI(B) and Hang Seng CPI
fell by 0.9 percent, 0.9 percent and 0.2 percent respectively in
November.
</P>
<P>
The corresponding rates of change in October were -0.1 percent,
virtually nil and +0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
A Government Secretariat spokesman noted that the last time
that the overall consumer price inflation turned negative was back
in 1975.
</P>
<P>
This time, it reflected, to a large extent, the slack overall
economic conditions and the continuing process of cost and price
adjustment upon the impact of the regional financial turmoil, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Yet also contributing to the distinct easing in inflation were
the freezing in government fees and charges and in a number of
public utility charges, as well as the one-off rates rebate by
the government effective in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that the further easing in consumer prices
helped to contain the cost of living at a time when economic
conditions were more difficult.
</P>
<P>
Also, reduced costs, being part and parcel of the adjustment
process, helped to moderate the cost of doing business.
</P>
<P>
Compared with October 1998, the composite CPI for November
decreased by 0.6 percent. The corresponding decreases in the
CPI(A), CPI(B) and Hang Seng CPI were 0.8 percent, 0.8 percent and
0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
For the first 11 months of 1998, the increase in the composite
CPI averaged 3.2 percent over the same period in 1997. The
corresponding increases in the CPI(A), CPI(B) and Hang Seng CPI
were 3.0 percent, 3.2 percent and 3.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Angola Threatens to Break Deals with De Beers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Angola has threatened to
cancel all agreements with diamond giant De Beers if it proves
the South African company is involved in business with the
National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
The Southern African Broadcasting Association reported Monday
that Angola issued the warning following allegations of such ties
by the British human rights group Global Witness.
</P>
<P>
Jose Dias, administrator of the Angolan National Diamonds
Company, was quoted as saying that the government of Angolan
President Jose Dos Santos would investigate the charges by the
London-based group.
</P>
<P>
He said that Angola would scrap some agreements with De Beers
if it confirmed that the multinational company and the UNITA were
involved in deals.
</P>
<P>
In its report, Global Witness accused De Beers of carrying out
business, worth at least three billion U.S. Dollars with the
UNITA since the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The human rights group claimed that De Beers was involved in
many mining projects, mostly in eastern Angola which had been
controlled by the UNITA, the country's leading opposition party.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA, which is under United Nations sanctions, has
renewed the civil war, violating a peace accord it signed with
the Angolan government in 1994 in Zambian capital Lusaka.

<HEADLINE> Jurist Calls for Efforts to Punish Subversive Activities (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, December 21 (Xinhua) -- A prominent jurist said today
that all subversive activities endangering China's socialist
system and state security should be punished in accordance with
law.
</P>
<P>
"The most important legal basis for a trial of subversion is
the Constitution of the People's Republic of China," said Ma
Kechang, a professor at the Law School of Wuhan University in
central China.
</P>
<P>
According to the Constitution, China is a socialist country
with a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class
and based on the alliance of workers and peasants, and socialism
is its fundamental system, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
Ma noted that in accordance with the country's Criminal Law,
activities subverting state power and attempting to overturn the
socialist system are actions endangering state security. And
therefore, "any of these activities should be punished according
to law", he said.
</P>
<P>
Subversive activities encompass enticing and contacting people
to overthrow the state power, or even planning to establish a
"society" or "party", he said, adding that plotting or carrying
out such activities are also considered to be subversion.
</P>
<P>
"Any such activities that are carried out constitutes an
accomplished offense," Ma said. Subjectively, subversion of the
state power or overturning socialism is on purpose, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Ma, major subversion criminals may be sentenced to
imprisonment of 10 years or more, or even given a life sentence;
but those who are not actively participating in subversive
activities may receive a sentence of less than three years.
</P>
<P>
Ma said that according to the Constitution, people's courts in
China have the right to conduct trials independently, without any
interference from administrations, organizations or individuals.
</P>
<P>
"China's courts at different levels try criminal cases on their
own, including cases of subversion, without the interference of
government," Ma stressed.
</P>
<P>
Ma has been engaged in the study of Eastern and Western law
codes for 50 years, and took part in drafting and revising
China's criminal law, including the new one adopted a year ago.

<TEXT>
<P>
According to Ma, it is common practice in most countries of the
world to investigate the criminal responsibility of anyone accused
of subversive activities, which are generally regarded as serious
crimes.
</P>
<P>
In this respect, he said, the criminal laws of Germany, France,
Italy, Austria and several other countries all have stipulations
rather similar to those of China, and the penalties for the crime
of subversion are fairly severe.
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, the Criminal Law of France which came
into effect in 1994 stipulates that anyone conducting one or more
activities harmful to the system of the republic or the
territorial integrity of the state can be convicted of treason,
which can lead to a 30-year imprisonment and a fine of three
million francs.
</P>
<P>
The professor went on to say that some Western media have
misinterpreted China's criminal trials, attempting to say that in
China the subverting of state power is the same as "regarding
democracy as a crime".
</P>
<P>
"This misinterpretation derives not only from their lack of
knowledge about the criminals' concrete activities, but also from
their misunderstanding of China's laws," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that China is a socialist country exercising a people's
democratic dictatorship, and that people's democracy has become an
inalienable part of China's social system.
</P>
<P>
"China's laws grant the people a wide range of democratic
rights, but democracy cannot go beyond the Constitution, let alone
become an excuse for attempts to subvert state power and overthrow
the existing social system," he stressed. "It's the same situation
even in those developed capitalist countries."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The global security
situation this year has exhibited three characteristics, namely,
continuing crises, greater inclination toward foreign military
interference, and strong challenges to security agencies across
the world.
</P>
<P>
Xiong Guangkai, Director of the China Institute for
International Strategic Studies (CIISS), made the comments at a
CIISS annual metting here today.
</P>
<P>
Xiong, also deputy chief of general staff of the Chinese
People's Liberation Army, described the year 1998 as an
extraordinary year filled with security crises.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the number of security crises and armed
conflicts around the globe has averaged around 10 a year since
the end of the Cold War, far exceeding the average of 4
during the period of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out, political and diplomatic approaches
remain a major trend in solving international disputes, citing as
one example the peaceful resolution of Peru-Ecuadorian border
issues which had been suspended for over a century.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Clarifies Confusion on Medical Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Board of
Investment (BOI) said Monday it has given approval for the
setting-up of a training institute affiliated to a foreign medical
school but not an international medical college.
</P>
<P>
BOI Chairman Thilan Wijesinghe made the clarification in a
statement issued Monday afternoon in response to confused media
reports about the proposed project and protests by local medical
students against establishing an international medical college in
Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Wijesinghe, who is also director general of the BOI, said in
the statement that the approval granted by the BOI is for the
setting-up of a training institute affiliated to a foreign medical
school but not an international medical college.
</P>
<P>
Media reports earlier this month said that Sri Lanka will set
up an international medical college in Colombo with an in-house
teaching hospital, the first of its kind in the country.
</P>
<P>
The reports also said students passing the college will be
awarded degrees by the world renowned Aberdeen University in the
United Kingdom with which the college is tied up.
</P>
<P>
The reports evoked controversy in medical circles and
demonstrations by medical students who worry about their future
competition.
</P>
<P>
Wijesinghe said it should be emphasized that the proposed
training institution will not grant medical degrees locally as
this is explicitly prohibited under the University Act.
</P>
<P>
He noted the proposed facility is in no way similar to the
North Colombo Medical Campus which has conferred local degrees for
many years.
</P>
<P>
Doctors obtaining degrees through the foreign university
affiliated to this institution will be able to practice in Sri
Lanka only if they sit for routine exams and abide by any other
conditions imposed by the relevant ministry, Wijesinghe added.

<HEADLINE> China's Iron, Steel Output Grows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 21 (Xinhua) -- China produced 104 million
tons of steel in the first 11 months of 1998, up 6.5 percent
from the same period last year, and the output of rolled steel
hit 94 million tons, up 9.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures from the State Administration of
Metallurgical Industry also indicate that although the sector
realized a gross industrial output value of 160.9 billion yuan
during the period, its profit stood at only 443 million yuan, down
61.97 percent from the corresponding 1997 period.
</P>
<P>
A research report from the Administration attributes the drop
in profit to an increase in transportation and electricity costs

<HEADLINE> Nepali PM Resigns for Formation of New Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Girija
Prasad Koirala Monday tendered his resignation to King Birendra to
make way for the formation of a new coalition government to
conduct general elections.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Nepali Congress (NC) said in a press statement that
the move was taken in accordance with the decision of its Central
Working Committee and the agreement reached Sunday with the main
opposition Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxism-Leninism,
CPN-UML).
</P>
<P>
Koirala also submitted to the king a letter with signatures of
legislators from the NC, the CPN-UML and the Nepal Sadbhavana
Party (NSP) supporting his continued premiership in the new
coalition, the NC said.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML agreed Sunday to support the efforts of the ruling
Nepali Congress (NC) to form a new coalition government for
conducting the elections in April 1999.
</P>
<P>
The NC and the CPN-UML also agreed to include the two factions
of the National Democratic Party (RPP), the NSP and the Communist
Party of Nepal (Marxism-Leninism, CPN-ML) into the new cabinet,
which will be small in size.
</P>
<P>
But the CPN-ML, which quit the coalition with the NC on
December 10, registered a no-confidence motion Sunday against the
NC government together with the RPP and the Nepal Workers and
Peasants Party.
</P>
<P>
King Birendra had decided to call a special session of
parliament Thursday as requested by the CPN-ML and its supporters
to discuss the no-confidence motion, which becomes meaningless
with the resignation of Prime Minister Koirala.
</P>
<P>
CPN-ML General Secretary Bam Dev Gautam said Sunday that there
was no chance of a coalition between his party and the NC under
Koirala's premiership again.
</P>
<P>
The party pulled out of the government after sharing power with
the NC for three and a half months. It alleged that the NC had
failed to implement the agreements reached with it and other left
parties in August.
</P>
<P>
The Himalayan kingdom has witnessed five governments since the
mid-term polls in November 1994 which produced a hung parliament
where no single party holds a majority.

focuses for plains and mountainous areas, and is coordinating

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Eases Ban on Certain Products to Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has agreed to lift a
ban on the export of wood and fishery products to Thailand, but
will continue to impose import restrictions on consumer goods from
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Thai Commerce Ministry sources on Monday confirmed media
reports that Myanmar made the decision following a request from
Thailand a month ago to relax export and import restrictions in a
bid to increase trade.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has banned the export of 31 types of products,
including the much-needed cattle, gems and coal, to Thailand in an
effort to reverse a trade imbalance. It also bans import of
certain consumer and luxury items including monosodium glutamate,
soft drinks, biscuits, canned fruit and vegetables, fresh fruit,
instant noodles, liquor and cigarettes from Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Commerce Minister Pravich Rattanapian repeated the Thai
request when he met his Myanmar counterpart Myo Tint in Rangoon
earlier this month. He also sought to trade Thailand's fuel for
Myanmar's natural gas.
</P>
<P>
But Rangoon maintained that the issue must be considered by the
joint Thai-Myanmar trade committee.
</P>
<P>
Thai Chamber of Commerce President Vichian Tejapaibon, who
accompanied Pravich on the visit, said the Thai private sector
intends to invest in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Thai businessmen are conducting a feasibility study on the
production of food, clothes and furniture, using local materials,
and of building bonded warehouses in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
However, Thai traders and investors in Myanmar are battling
hard to survive, given the absence of foreign direct investment in
the country since the regional financial crisis began in July last
year.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Share prices closed lower on
Singapore Stock Market Monday after the country's Trade
Development Board (TDB) released economic data showing that
Singapore's external trade slipped further in November.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) shed 8.23 points to end
at 1,397.73 points.
</P>
<P>
The total turnover decreased to 120.55 million units worth
254.16 million Singapore dollars (154.11 million U.S. dollars).
Losers edged out gainers by 84 to 67 with 168 counters unchanged.
</P>
<P>
DBS Land was the most active stock of the day with a turnover
of 7.67 million units. KepLand was the second most heavily traded
stock with a volume of 5.69 million units done. SingTel was next
with 4.52 million counters changing hands.
</P>

<P>
Dealers noted that the stock market opened firmer in morning
session in early holiday-thinned trading as players reacted with
indifference to U.S. House votes to impeach President Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
However, prices later eased back slightly after the TDB's
statistics revealed that Singapore's exports contracted by 7.3
percent in November compared to the same period in 1997, dealers
added.
</P>
<P>
Dealers also said the decline in Tokyo bourse also contributed
to the decline.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the market logically underwent a winding-down
process before a year-end.
</P>
<P>
They said the slowing down of activity for most of last week
and the largely quiet sessions pointed to a holiday mood and an
absence of many players because of the festive season.

The opposition is hopeful that the censure motion would be
submitted to Parliament by January 10.
</P>
<P>
The opposition had previously submitted a motion seeking to
impeach Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai and Tarrin for issuing
letters of intent to obtain the bailout package from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) without parliamentary approval.
</P>
<P>
Suraporn said he believed that the validity of the impeachment
motion would be determined before the censure move.
</P>
<P>
The Counter Corruption Commission decided last weekend to pass
the impeachment motion to the Constitutional Court to rule on its
validity. The technical hitch has unexpectedly delayed the
opposition's move to get the motion debated in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Suraporn told reporters that the no-confidence motion would
seek to bring to light "the corrupt practices" of some ministers
in the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman declined to identify the ministers to be
targeted in the debate.
</P>
<P>
Opposition sources said, however, that Sanan, Tarrin and Suthep
were the prime targets followed by ministers of the Prime Minister
Office Supatra Masdit and Jurin Laksanavisit.
</P>
<P>
The opposition would push for a two-day debate on the motion.
One full day would be devoted to debating the work of Sanan, the
sources said.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's External Trade Drops Further in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Statistics released by
Singapore's Trade Development Board (TDB) Monday show that the
country's external trade experienced further decline in November,
registering a fall of 14.5, 7.3 and 21.4 percent respectively in
the volume of total trade, exports and imports over a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Compared with November 1997, non-oil domestic exports (NODX)
continued to dive, decreasing by 3.3 percent in November,
following a marginal growth of 0.3 percent in October and
highlighting a significant slowdown in growth of NODX to the EU.
</P>
<P>
Electronic exports remained weak contracting by 4.9 percent and
domestic exports of non-electronics also trended downwards
expanding by an anemic 0.5 percent after a subdued 3.6 percent
growth in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
November also saw domestic exports of oil shrinking by 12.1
percent and non-oil re-exports (NORX) contracting by 11.2 percent
over a year ago.
</P>
<P>
In November, NORX to the U.S. increased marginally by 0.6
percent while that to the EU contracted by 7.1 percent and NORX to
major Asian destinations, viz. Malaysia, Thailand, South Korea,
Hong Kong and Taiwan, continued to decline, reflecting depressed
economic conditions in these markets.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil imports excluding lumpy items such as aircraft and
ships continued to decline, falling by 20.5 percent in November
1998 compared to November 1997.
</P>
<P>
Of the top five traditional NODX markets, NODX to the U.S.
continued to weaken, shrinking further by 5.4 percent in November
over a year ago. The growth of NODX to the EU moderated to 10.1
percent from 20.0 percent in the preceding month while NODX to
Malaysia, Japan and Hong Kong continued to plummet by eight, 10.5
and 23.9 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's NODX to emerging markets increased marginally by
0.1 percent in November with China market outstanding in a
nine-percent rise and Latin American and Eastern European markets
shrinking significantly.
</P>
<P>
TDB attributed the fall in the country's external trade in
November to the worsening economic conditions in the five
crisis-ridden economies, namely, Japan, Malaysia, Hong Kong,
Thailand and South Korea, which account for 42.8 percent of
Singapore's trade, as well as to lackluster global demand for
certain electronic products which continued to take its toll on
Singapore's external trade.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Close Softer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 21 (Xinhua) --The Australian share market
closed weaker Monday on the combination of some caution arising
from the impeachment of U.S. President Bill Clinton and lower
volumes leading into the holiday season.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index dropped 11.3 points to 2,738.0, with
the U.S. market Monday night likely to react to the impeachment of
Clinton by the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
"The events in the States over the weekend have made people a
little bit on the cautious side and going into the holiday period
the market tends to quiet down a bit," Sam Panetta from Shaw
Stockbroking said.
</P>
<P>
"I think it (the U.S. financial market) could have an initial
reaction downwards but any large selling will be short-lived and
the market will pick up soon afterwards," he said.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index dropped 19.3 points to 4,912.6, with
further strong activity in the telecommunications sector.
</P>
<P>
ANZ bank led the banking sector, rising 22.3 cents to 10.75
Australian dollars after its annual meeting was told of progress
in increasing profit in this financial year, and that provision
for Asian bad debts would also be lower.
</P>
<P>
Westpac bank was down 1.5 cents at 10.45 Australian dollars on
turnover of 7.2 million shares, National Australia Bank dropped 20
cents to 24.60 Australian dollars, and Commonwealth Bank of
Australia was up 8.6 cents at 22.20 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index dropped 4.8 points to 960.8 with gold
stocks dragging it lower.
</P>
<P>
The gold index fell 22.2 points to 1,097.0 as the bullion price
slid 1.70 U.S. dollars per ounce to 289.80 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Australia's leading company BHP rose ten cents to 12.10
Australian dollars while global miner Rio Tinto finished 7.4 cents
lower at 18.826 Australian dollars.
</P>

<P>
CANBERRA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar was
almost stagnate Monday, ending steady in soft, directionless
trade.
</P>
<P>
After trading in a tight range between 61.88 U.S. cents and
62.05 U.S. cents, the local currency finished at 62.01 U.S. cents
from 62.00 U.S. cents late last Friday.
</P>
<P>
A foreign exchange dealer from Bankers Trust said that "the
market, corporations and investors alike, has realized it is
Christmas week so they just come in, do what they have to do and
leave it alone for the rest of the day".
</P>
<P>
The factors playing on either side of the Australian dollar are
weak commodity prices and strength in the Japanese yen against the
U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the local session the Australian dollar was
trading at 71.20 Japanese yen from 71.97 yen last Friday and
1.0282 German marks from 1.0310 marks.

<P>
PARIS, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Monday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Clinton refused to disarm in front of the Republicans who
voted to impeach him on Saturday in the House of Representatives,
the first in 130 years in the history of the United States. While
announcing an end to the bombings on Iraq, Clinton said that he
would remain in office until the last day of his term.
</P>
<P>
-- The cry of victory by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was not
without reason this time. Besides knocking out the UNSCOM, Saddam is
expecting an alleviation of the U.N. sanctions following the
U.S.-British bombing last week. French President Jacques Chirac has
suggested a gradual lifting of embargo on Iraqi oil sale.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- While he has ended the bombings in Iraq, U.S. President Bill
Clinton will begin in January another battle at the U.S. Senate for
the survival of his political life. The Republicans, who have only
55 seats in the Senate, will have to seek support from 12 Democrats
to collect a two thirds majority of votes to impeach Clinton.
</P>
<P>
-- The operation ``Desert Fox'' has deepened the gap among member
countries of the European Union. British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein should hold no illusion and
the U.S. and Britain are ready to strike again if necessary. French
President Jacques Chirac has proposed a three-point strategy for
going out of the crisis -- improving living conditions of Iraqis,
changing method of armament control and lifting oil embargo.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 21 (Xinhua) -- A large-scale construction
campaign began today in Shanghai, China's largest industrial
center, to transform old neighborhoods into new and more
comfortable living quarters in about five years.
</P>
<P>
The China Ocean Shipping Corporation (Shanghai) Industry Co.,
Ltd. will invest six billion yuan into this effort, along with the
city's Putuo District.
</P>
<P>
The project is aimed at improving housing conditions in three
major residential quarters adjacent to the Shanghai Railway
Station, where old shack-like dwellings cover an area of 49.5
hectares.
</P>
<P>
Today's opening ceremony, attended by Huang Ju, member of the
Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party
of China (CPC) and secretary of the city's CPC committee, and
Mayor Xu Kuangdi, marked the beginning of the city government's
ambitious plan to transform 3.65 million square meters of inferior
housing.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, with a current population of more than 13 million,
has long been plagued by housing problems.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Calls for Review of Sanctions on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Crown Prince and the
Regent Hassan Ibn Talal has said that sanctions on Iraq should be
reviewed, taking humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people into
consideration.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to the Iraqi-Jordanian border Sunday evening, he
stressed the need for the resumption of dialog between Iraq and
the world community and for a definition of the political
objectives of the world community in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Hassan said that the cessation of military strikes on Iraq
will lead to the resumption of dialog.
</P>
<P>
Charity organizations of the world are calling for public
donations for the Iraqis, he said, adding this is not a substitute
for the lifting of sanctions, which had been imposed on Iraq
following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The crown prince said that the kingdom is deeply concerned
for the essential services in Iraq, expressing relief that
infrastructure services like water and electricity had not been
affected by the strikes.
</P>
<P>
Accompanying the Regent during the tour, Jordanian Prime
Minister Fayez Tarawneh said the Jordanian-Iraqi border will
remain open to the Iraqis as it was during the just-concluded
United States-British air attacks on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh said the Jordanian government and people share the
feeling of solidarity with the Iraqi people and understand the
injustice Iraq had suffered during the past decade.

<HEADLINE> Australia Seeks International Financial Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Australia seeks better
supervision of the international financial system and increased
transparency in world market dealings, according to a report
released Monday by Australian Prime Minister John Howard.
</P>
<P>
During a ceremony to launch the report, the Australian prime
minister committed his government to actively pursuing many of the
suggestions included in the report by a task force he established
two months ago to look at international financial reforms.
</P>
<P>
Howard said the report would be forwarded to world leaders in
the coming new year.
</P>
<P>
He said the Group of 22 nations, or G22, including seven
industrialized countries, China and Australia, would be the
"centerpiece of international efforts to get greater transparency
and to achieve some of the reforms" in financial dealings.
</P>
<P>
The task force proposed establishment of a working group to
examine appropriate disclosure standards for highly leveraged
hedge funds, and also suggested Australia play an active role in
the establishment of a working group on improved crisis
management.
</P>
<P>
The task force identified key principles for reforming the
international financial system so as to produce greater stability
and capital flows and minimize the risk of future crises.
</P>
<P>
The report proposed that countries prepare "transparency"
reports which indicate the extent to which they meet recognized
disclosure standards.
</P>
<P>
It also recommended encouraging international efforts to
increase trade finance for the crisis economies and providing
technical assistance to facilitate bank and corporate
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
The report also suggested providing technical assistance to
regional economies on developing and managing a sovereign bond
market.
</P>
<P>
One of the recommendations was that countries should be
encouraged to remove any distortions, such as tax incentives
favoring short-term capital flows.
</P>
<P>
Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Ian Macfarlane, the heads of
several government departments and senior representatives from the
Australian banking and financial sectors, made up the task force.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said Australia was in a position to argue
the cause of financial sector reform in the international arena
because of the strength of the domestic financial system.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine army and police
said Monday that they have been prepared for possible terrorist
attacks by the Mindanao-based extremist rebel group Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine News Agency quoted National Police Chief
Director General Roberto Lastimoso and Army Chief of Staff Joselin
Nazareno as saying that they are ready for possible acts of
terrorism by the Abu Sayyaf to avenge the death of its leader
Abdurajak Abubakar Janjalani last week.
</P>
<P>
Lastimoso and Nazareno also said the terrorist group is not
capable of actually disrupting peace and order in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
"There is the possibility that the remnants, sympathizers or
even friends of the Abu Sayyaf will try to get even by conducting
some terroristic act to embarrass the government," Lastimoso said.
</P>
<P>
Janjalani, the most wanted criminal in the Philippines, was
killed in an encounter with government troops in Basilan,
Mindanao, last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The extremist rebel group has conducted a series of criminal
activities in the past few years, including the killing of 54
civilians in the town of Ipil, the Southern Philippines, in April
1995.
</P>
<P>
Nazareno said the military is keeping tabs on "all forces" that
intend to conduct terrorist activities, particularly on embassies.

<HEADLINE> Islamic Militants Claim Responsibility for Recent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 21 (Xinhua) -- A group of Islamic militants
have claimed responsibility for the recent murders of an Iranian
opposition leader and several dissident writers in Tehran, local
daily Zan (Women) reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The group, called "Fadayan-e Islam Nab Mohammadi Mostafa Navab"
(Islamic Volunteers of His Excellency Pure Mohammad Mostafa), has
issued a statement claiming responsibility for the killings, the
daily said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the group took the responsibility for
the killings of veteran opposition leader Darius Forouhar and his
wife, two dissident writers Mohammad Mokhtari and Mohammad Jafar
Pouyandeh.
</P>
<P>
Forouhar, secretary general of the Iran Nation Party, and his
wife Parvaneh Eskandari were stabbed to death at home in northern
Tehran in late November. Mokhtari and Pouyandeh were found dead,
apparently strangled, after missing for days earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
"The revolutionary executions were a warning to those
mercenary writers and those against (Islamic) values," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The identity of the group is not clear for the Iranian public
so far. Last month, it also claimed responsibility for the attack
on a group of 13 American businessmen in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Interior Minister Mostafa Tajzadeh said on Thursday
that the Iranian authorities have found certain clues about the
recent killings.
</P>
<P>
"We know that they are not foreign nationals but Iranians,
whom we do not yet know enough about," he said, adding that
a special committee comprising deputy interior and intelligence
ministers and security officials has been formed to probe into
the killings.
</P>
<P>
Several other prominent intellectuals were also slayed or
missing during the past weeks.
</P>
<P>
Conservative hardliners, who take most of the key positions in
the country, have earlier accused "foreign agents," specifically
Israel, and an exiled dissident group of carrying out the killings
of these government critics.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Latin America Fights to Resist Financial Turmoil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Economic growth of Latin
America this year has been under pounding pressure due to the
Asian financial crisis that has gone on for one year and a half,
and the Russian financial crisis breaking out not long ago.
</P>
<P>
In order to prevent the financial crisis from lavishing the
region, countries in Latin America have taken measures to adjust
domestic economy, gain international support and strive for a
sustainable economic development.
</P>
<P>
Affected by the financial crisis, Latin America has witnessed a
sharp drop in exports and surge in trade deficit in 1988. Among
countries that are affected remarkably, Brazil, Mexico and
Argentina will register an annual trade deficit of more than six
billion U.S. dollars, and Chile, three billion dollars, three
times that of 1997.
</P>
<P>
There are two key reasons for this situation:
</P>
<P>
One is that exports to the Asian countries in financial crisis
have greatly decreased. Another is that the devaluation of
currencies has rendered Latin American exports less competitive.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the continued low prices of primary products such
as oil, copper and coffee on the international market are also
reasons for the decreasing income of Latin America. For instance,
Venezuela is expected to experience a 6-billion-dollar drop in its
oil earning while Chile will lose 1.6 billion in its copper export
due to depressed prices this year.
</P>
<P>
The Russian financial chaos breaking out in August this year
has affected almost the whole of Latin America with Brazil hit the
hardest. In mid-September, its stock markets of Sao Paulo and Rio
de Janeiro slumped and the total market value shrank from 255
billion dollars to 145 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Brazil's foreign capital outflowed by about 30
billion dollars and foreign reserves dropped from its peak 74
billion dollars to 45 billion dollars, exposing its currency to
great pressure of devaluation.
</P>
<P>
Like the stock markets in Brazil, those in Mexico, Argentina
and some others fared no better.
</P>
<P>
To avoid Southeast Asia-type financial crisis, Latin American
countries have regulated the pace of economic growth and adopted
other positive measures.
</P>
<P>
First, strengthening the macro-economic control and
administration of financial markets.
</P>
<P>
The majority of Latin American countries, including Brazil,
Mexico, Chile and Venezuela, have cut down public expenditure and
financial deficit. Along with the changes on the international
market, they have also strengthened their supervision over capital
markets and enhanced bank interest rates to encourage savings
deposits.
</P>
<P>
All these have played a vital role in helping the countries to
balance their budget and regular expenditure, moderately stabilize
their currencies, limit the transient investments, minimize their
dependence on foreign capital and enhance their resistance to
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Second, adjusting the export strategy adequately and timely.
</P>
<P>
Facing serious challenges in their foreign trade, the Latin
American countries have made great efforts in expanding their
international markets and diversifying export
products. Specifically, they have strengthened trade ties with the
European Union, urged the medium- and small-size businesses to go
international and promoted exports of non-traditional products,
all designed to strengthen international competitiveness and off
set loss caused by falling raw materials prices.
</P>
<P>
Third, promoting regional cooperation and seeking outside
support.
</P>
<P>
To deal with the serious financial turmoil, Latin American
countries have worked closely among themselves while wooing
support from international financial facilities and the Group of
Seven.
</P>
<P>
In mid-September, financial ministers and central bankers from
nine countries including Brazil, Argentina, Mexico and Chile, met
with officials from the United States, Canada and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Within some two months, through tough negotiations, Brazil
landed a 41.5-billion-dollar loan from the IMF for the next three
years. This money will be vital in revitalizing Brazil's economy
and promoting financial stability of the region as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Latin America has done a great deal. With a relatively solid
economic foundation coupled with rapid and effective preventive
measures, the financial chaos has now been eased and crisis
stopped.
</P>
<P>
Quite a few international economic organizations are convinced
of Latin America's economic vitality despite the slowdown of its
development.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that with the only exception of Venezuela,
whose GDP will drop by one percent, the whole region will still be
crowned with a continued GDP growth of eight percent this year,
2.5 percent above that of last year.

<HEADLINE> British Experts Scrutinize Uganda Army Finances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has invited a British
consultancy firm to scrutinize and audit the accounts of its
armed forces following fraud allegations in the purchase of
military equipment.
</P>
<P>
The study, which is already underway, is being done by Tony
Lavender Associates of the United Kingdom and funded by the
Department for International Development, the East African weekly
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
This is the fifth by international consultants since 1986 of
Uganda's public procurement system, seen as the government's
another move against corruption reportedly rampant in the
military.
</P>
<P>
Some senior army officers have been accused of demanding huge
commissions in the purchase of non-combat-worthy helicopters and
62 controversial T-55 tanks from eastern Europe, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
Salim Saleh, former senior presidential advisor on defense and
security and President Yoweri Museveni's younger brother, had
confessed to the president that he had been involved in the
helicopter deal.
</P>
<P>
Less than 10 of the 62 tanks which are said to be 30 years old
are operational, a MP claimed recently in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
With an increase of 26 percent in the military spending in
this fiscal year, more equipment has been imported to modernize
Uganda's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The recent exposure of rampant frauds in the country's
privatization exercise of parastatals angered the MPs so much so
that they demanded an explanation from the government.

<HEADLINE> World's Only Deaf Ballet Dancer to Perform in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The only hearing-impaired
ballet dancer in the world, Kang Jim Hee of the Republic of Korea,
will make her first appearance in China next January.
</P>
<P>
Invited by the Chinese Dancers Association, the Cho Seung Mi
Dance Company in which Kang performs, will stage the ballet
"Samson and Delilah" on January 2-3, with Kang dancing the role of
Delilah.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-six-year-old Kim was born deaf, and even with the
assistance of an audiophone can barely hear the siren
of a train. However, with her special talent and through hard
work, she has been able to realize considerable achievements.
</P>
<P>
In 1992 she won a national dance competition for university
students; in 1993 she placed second at an international
ballet competition in Japan, and the same year took part in
the Moscow international ballet competition where she was awarded
a prize.
</P>
<P>
For her achievements, President Kim Young-Sam and President Kim
Dae-Jung recognized her with special presidential awards in 1995
and 1998 as a tribute to her courage in overcoming disability.
</P>
<P>
Many people wonder how Kang manages to follow the rhythm and
keep in step with her partners. Her teacher Cho simply attributes
Kang's virtuosity to her talent and constant practice. The Chinese
dancer who will play the role of Samson said it is unbelievable
that Kang has made herself such a wonderful dancer when their
feelings can only be exchanged through the sense of touch.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Asks Butler to Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has accused Richard
Butler, the chief U.N. weapons inspector in Iraq, of being a
troublemaker and asked him to quit.
</P>
<P>
"Butler has lost his credibility, as his stint has become to go
to Iraq to stir up a new problem," the Egyptian Gazette newspaper
quoted Foreign Minister Amr Moussa as saying.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters Sunday, Moussa maintained that it is in
the interest of all that Butler's mission would come to an end.
</P>
<P>
Butler leads the United Nations Special Commission, or UNSCOM,
in charge of overseeing the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction, namely the nuclear, chemical and biological weapons
and long-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM must certify that Iraq has destroyed all the banned
weapons before the U.N. Security Council can lift the sanctions
imposed on the country after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Butler said last week in a report submitted to the U.N. that
Baghdad has failed to cooperate fully with the U.N. arms
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The report was cited by the United States and Britain as
justification for a four-day sustained missile attack on Iraq
since Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
"We should blame the U.N. Special Commission for its failure to
do its job in the proper way. Butler's stand and his performance
were not up to the standard," Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
Butler or whoever would replace him should not work
independently from the U.N., he stressed, adding that the whole
situation and the arms inspections should be reviewed thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
"Can anyone believe that the international community has spent
all this time, money and effort without reaching solid facts that
can help close any of the files on the Iraqi weapons?" Moussa
wondered.

<HEADLINE> China Sentences Two to Prison for Subversion of State Power (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese courts today
sentenced two men convicted of subverting state power to 13 and 11
years in prison respectively.
</P>
<P>
Xu Wenli, a Beijing resident, and Wang Youcai in east China's
Zhejiang Province, also received a three-year deprivation of their
political rights from the Beijing No.1 Intermediate People's Court
and the Intermediate People's Court of Hangzhou, capital of
Zhejiang.
</P>
<P>
Both Xu and Wang previously served prison terms in China.
</P>
<P>
In an open trial today, the Beijing No.1 Intermediate People's
Court found that in November this year, with the purpose of
subverting state power, Xu secretly planned the founding of the
so-called "Beijing and Tianjin Regional Party Committee of the
China Democratic Party," formulated this illicit organization's
"constitution," and served as its "chairman."
</P>
<P>
The court also found that Xu made efforts to recruit "Party
members," planned to convene a "National Party Congress," and
sought and accepted funds from some hostile overseas organizations
in order to organize, plan and conduct subversive activities.
</P>
<P>
It was also proved by court investigation that from November
1997 to April 1998, Xu used various means to stir up subversive
activities.

After hearing opinions from the prosecutors and the defense,
the court ruled that in accordance with relevant stipulations in
China's Criminal Law, Xu's activities constituted the crime
of subverting state power, and he should be punished according to
law as both a principal element in the case and a recidivist.
</P>
<P>
In an open trial in Zhejiang, the Intermediate People's Court
of Hangzhou found that in June this year, with the purpose of
subverting state power, Wang secretly planned to found an illicit
organization called the "China Democratic Party," formed a
"Zhejiang Preparatory Committee for the China Democratic Party,"
and formulated a so-called "Party constitution" and an
"declaration."
</P>
<P>
The court also found that in order to organize, plan and
conduct subversive activities, Wang contacted some hostile
overseas organizations, from which he sought and accepted
financial support.
</P>
<P>
After hearing the opinions of the prosecutors and the defense,
the court ruled that in accordance with relevant stipulations in
China's Criminal Law, Wang's activities constituted the crime of
subverting state power, that the crime was severe, and that he
should also be punished as a recidivist.
</P>
<P>
The families of Xu and Wang and people from various walks of
life attended today's court hearings.

ROME -- The European Union (EU) needs to adjust its foreign
policy and security arrangements following the members' dissonant
views on the U.S.-British strikes on Iraq, Italian Foreign
Minister Lamberto Dini said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Lower House,
Dini said Europe's dissonant views about the strikes and EU's
collective silence have highlighted an "emergency." He believed
that London's participation in the U.S.-led air attacks on Iraq
constituted a clear choice of putting Britain's relationship with
Washington over its ties with the EU. (Italy-EU-Iraq)

damage, mainly to the civilian infrastructure and to human life. I
am told that the casualties are in thousands, in terms of people
who were killed or wounded. But we do not have any final figures."
Hamdoon said Iraq would ask the United Nations Security Council to
lift immediately the economic sanctions which had been in place
for eight years. (UN-Iraq-Casualties)

LUSAKA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian Drug Enforcement
Commission (DEC) has arrested two people for trafficking drugs
worth 78.4 million Kwacha (about 32,660 U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Zambia's daily newspaper, the Post, Monday quoted DEC
spokesman Mukutulu Sinyani as saying in a statement that
41-year-old Tanzanian Erisaria Masawe was found with two carton

<HEADLINE> Danish Line to Introduce 21-Day Service to E. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Nordana, the Danish shipping
line which began a direct east Africa-Europe service in June this
year, is restructuring the service to a 21-day frequency from the
initial fortnightly service.
</P>
<P>
Reshadi Noor, the Ship's Agency Department Manager of
Panalpina, said the move had been necessitated by the increased
demand on break-bulk as opposed to containerized cargo services.
Pahanlpina is the line's Mombasa ground agent.
</P>
<P>
The line will also replace the faster Astrakhan Mark III class
vessels with Mark II, which are more economical, the East African
weekly newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Mark II vessels have larger holds and hatch openings, fast
cranes with heavy lift facilities and ample container space
including refrigerated units and can cope well with the transit
time of 19 days between Europe and east Africa.
</P>
<P>
Noor said the restructuring program has sparked rumors within
the industry that Nordana was pulling out of the trade.
</P>
<P>
"This was never the case. All we did was adopt a service
which would be more suited for our clientele," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mv (motor vessel) Nordana Karlina, the first vessel on the
restructured service, is due at the port of Mombasa on December
27, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The ship will offload some 9,367 tons of import cargo
including motor cars, malt for the local brewing industry, iron
coils, steel billets and 100 containers.
</P>
<P>
The second vessel, Nordana Captain P, is expected in Mombasa
on January 18, 1999.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Trade Surplus Down in Twenty Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Japan's merchandise trade
surplus in November fell by 15.1 percent from a year earlier to
902 billion yen (about 7.6 billion U.S. dollars), marking the
first drop in 20 months, the Finance Ministry said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry attributed the decline to a shrinkage in exports
to the United States, Japanese exporters' largest market. Japan's
exports to the U.S. fell for the first time in two years and eight
months.
</P>
<P>
Japan's overall exports dropped by 12.7 percent to 3,688.9
billion yen (about 31.2 billion dollars), while imports fell by
11.9 percent to 2,786.9 billion yen (about 23.6 billion dollars),
the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Japan's politically sensitive trade surplus with the
U.S. gained only 0.9 percent in November to 488.2 billion yen
(about 4.1 billion dollars), compared with a 31.9-percent jump in
the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Japan's trade surplus with Asian economies plummeted 66.3
percent to 184.7 billion yen (about 1.6 billion dollars), while
that with the 15-member European Union contracted 2.6 percent to
272.8 billion yen (about 2.3 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The yen averaged 118.36 to the U.S. dollar in the latest
reporting month, up 3.4 percent from a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> Traffic Accidents Cost S. Africa Dear Daily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Traffic accidents are
costing South Africa more than 40 million Rand (6.6 million U.S.
Dollars) a day, up from a staggering five million Dollars five
years ago, the Star daily reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Average of 30 people were killed each day on South Africa's
roads this decade, according to a survey by the the National
Trauman Research Program (NTRP).
</P>
<P>
An average of 100 people were seriously injured each day and
an average of 250 people suffered lesser injuries, the survey
showed.
</P>
<P>
Eric Buch, deputy director-general of the health department in
Gauteng Province, was quoted as saying that road accidents had a
major impact on health-care costs and services.
</P>
<P>
"The orthopaedic and neurosurgery wards are especially
pressured," he said.
</P>
<P>
People hospitalized with traffic trauma usually had severe
injuries, requiring protracted and expensive treatment. However,
only about 5.5 percent of the related costs were recovered from
patients, said Johan van der Spuy of the NTRP.
</P>
<P>
The NTRP identified speed, alcohol and other substance abuse,
as well as failure to wear seat belts and protective head gear in
the case of motorcycles and bicycles, as contributing factors to
the high fatality rates on South African roads.
</P>
<P>
Pedestrians also accounted for about 40 percent of annual road
fatalities, said Van der Spuy.

<HEADLINE> China Using More Foreign Loans for Highway Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 21 (Xinhua) -- China has used 4.5 billion
U.S. dollars worth of foreign loans to construct 9,000 kilometers
of highways, according to a report in the "China Reform News."
</P>
<P>
The loans were provided by such international financial
organizations as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank and
by foreign governments. The money has been used to finance highway
construction in all of the country's 24 provinces, autonomous
regions and municipalities, the newspaper quoted an official with
the Ministry of Communications as saying.
</P>
<P>
The official said the central Chinese government encourages
more domestic and overseas economic organizations to invest in
highway construction.
</P>
<P>
Companies engaged in developing and maintaining highways are
permitted to raise funds by way issuing shares or corporate bonds
in accordance with relevant laws and regulations, he added.
</P>
<P>
The building of highways through the formation of joint
ventures and cooperative companies is quite popular in eastern
coastal areas and some economically developed regions in the
country. South China's Guangdong Province, for instance, has
obtained 12 percent of its total investment for highway
construction from overseas investors, and more than a half its
funds for expressway construction from overseas.
</P>
<P>
The official disclosed that China will take steps to increase
the use of foreign capital in highway construction in the future,
especially by introducing more foreign funds for this purpose into
central and western areas of the country.

<HEADLINE> Nyerere to Report Progress in Burundi Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Julius Nyerere,
mediator of the Burundi crisis, will report the achievement from
the peace talks by warring parties to the nations which imposed
economic sanctions on Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Sources from Tanzanian northern town of Arusha, where three
rounds of peace talks have been held, told Xinhua Monday in a
telephone interview that preparations are well under way for the
fourth round of talks scheduled on January 18 in Arusha.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, founding president of Tanzania, told a closing
session by three committees for the peace talks over the weekend
that he will report the progress achieved so far to the leaders
of the Great Lakes nations as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The sweeping sanctions were imposed by seven neighboring
nations in August 1996 when retired Major Pierre Buyoya was
rethroned following a military coup by the Tutsi-led army in late
July.
</P>
<P>
They demanded Buyoya to restore constitutional order and open
talks with the major ethnic Hutu oppositions.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere also said that delegates from all the factions in
Burundi will debate on the reconstruction and development of the
tiny central African country in the forthcoming talks.
</P>
<P>
Since June, delegates from the Burundi government, parties and
rebel groups have met for three rounds of talks in Arusha in a
way to seek an end to the bloody tribal conflicts.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 150,000 Burundians, mostly civilians, have been
killed since 1993 when the first ethnic Hutu president Melchior
Ndadaye was assassinated in a military coup.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Burundi Minister for Peace Process Ambroise
Niyonsaba was quoted as saying in Arusha over the weekend that he
expected the sanctions will be lifted soon.
</P>
<P>
"Nyerere's remark gives me a hope that he will do something to
help in lifting the economic embargo against my country," he
said.

<HEADLINE> S. African Mining Giant Buys Zambian Copper Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 21 (Xinhua) -- South African mining
giant Anglo American Corporation (ACC) has signed a deal to buy
Zambia's state-owned copper mines, the Citizen newspaper reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The AAC would take over Nchanga, Nkana and Konkola mines, the
remaining major assets of Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines, the
country's sole mining conglomerate, the paper quoted Zambian
Finance Minister Edith Nawakwi as saying Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The South African investors have pledged to pump in 300
million U.S. Dollars in three years into the three mines and buy
the nearby Konkola Deep mine a year later with a pledged
investment of 800 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Konkola Deep mine is said to be the key to the future
viability of copper mining in Zambia at a time of low copper
prices on world commodity markets.
</P>
<P>
The ACC is expected to start operation in the Zambian mines by
March next year.
</P>
<P>
Zambia had been under intense pressure from its donors to sell
off the inefficient and overmanned mines.
</P>
<P>
The mines sold to the ACC were estimated to be losing up to
one million Dollars a day in recent weeks.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM-Designate Returns Mandate to Form </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister
designate Bulent Ecevit announced here Monday that he had
returned his mandate for a government formation to President
Suleyman Demirel.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit, also leader of the Democratic Left Party (DSP), the
fourth biggest party in the parliament, was assigned by Demirel
to form the 56th coalition government on December 2 after the
former minority government led by Mesut Yilmaz collapsed for his
corruption scandals on November 25.
</P>
<P>
Despite Ecevit's 17-day consultation with the political parties
in parliament, his efforts fell short of coming up with a
government that could pass a confidence vote in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The opposition True Path Party (DYP) Chairwoman, Tansu Ciller
and Republican People's Party (CHP) leader Deniz Baykal had
rejected three proposals for a coalition to be formed by the
Motherland Party (ANAP), the DYP and the DSP, a DSP minority
government and the broad-based government.
</P>
<P>
The time remaining for political parties to form a government
that could win a vote of confidence from parliament is now less
than three weeks.
</P>
<P>
If a government that could win a confidence vote from
parliament can not be formed by January 10, 1999, the Turkish
president will have the right to form a government that would not
require a confidence vote in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish constitution requires a designated prime minister
to form a new government within 45 days.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Marketers Double Fuel Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Petroleum products marketers in
Nigeria have increased the official pump price of petroleum from
11 Naira (about 0.13 U.S. Dollar) to 25 Naira per liter at the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
The price increase followed last week's proposed deregulation
of commodity prices by the Nigerian government, The Post Express
newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chief of General Staff Rear Admiral Mike Akhigbe said in
capital Abuja last Thursday that the government had no plans to
hike fuel price, but would allow marketers to fix an appropriate
price for the commodity.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has been gripped by a protracted fuel crisis all over
the country since 1996, leading to arbitrary hike in transport
fares and near-collapse of socio-economic activities.
</P>
<P>
Although the country is the sixth largest oil producer in the
world with a production capacity of 2.3 million barrels per day,
all its four refineries in the country broke down for technical
hitches, leading to severe scarcity of oil supply in the country.
</P>
<P>
There has been speculations that the Nigerian government would
increase fuel price in its 1999 budget to make up for the budget
deficit in 1998 because of the falling price of crude oil at the
international market.
</P>
<P>
The oil price increase has been a source of heated debate
between the government and labor groups in this west African
country as the development has the potentials to ignite a
widespread crisis.
</P>
<P>
When the price was adjusted in 1994, it generated serious
crisis which threatened the socio-political peace of the nation,
prompting the establishment of the Petroleum Trust Fund to manage
the extra funds realized by the price increase.

<HEADLINE> China's Finance Minister Reviews Reforms of Past 20 Years (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 21 (Xinhua) -- In a lengthy article entitled
"China's Finances in the Reforms and Opening-up" in today's
People's Daily, Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng reviews what
financial reforms have achieved in the past two decades as well as
the problems that still exist.
</P>
<P>
The veteran economist says that China has basically established
a finance and taxation framework that meets the requirements of
the socialist market economy in the process of its economic
reform. One of the major breakthroughs was the break with the
highly-centralized finance system of the planned economy and the
introduction of a revenue-sharing taxation system for the central
and local governments.
</P>
<P>
The reforms have also led to more diverse tax categories, and
more rational distribution, budget, and accounting practices, he
says, and continued fast growth in the economy and increased
finance reforms have provided a solid foundation for fairly high
growth rate in revenues.
</P>
<P>
China's revenues rose to 865.1 billion yuan (104.2 billion
U.S. dollars) in 1997, as opposed to 113.2 billion yuan in 1978,
for an annual growth rate of 11.3 percent. The growth has actually
been 18.8 percent since 1994 when the revenue-sharing system was
put into practice.

<HEADLINE> China's Finance Minister Reviews Reforms of Past 20 Years (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The increased revenues have increased the country's financial
strength, pushing expenditures to 923.3 billion yuan in 1997,
compared with 112.2 billion yuan in 1978.
</P>
<P>
But, in spite of the progress, he says, state financial power
is still clearly inadequate, causing the central government's
deficit to grow to 55.8 billion yuan in 1997 from 9.8 billion yuan
in 1979, and central government debts to 247.7 billion yuan in
1997 from 8.4 billion yuan in 1982.
</P>
<P>
One major task, he says, is to make an effort to gradually
increase the proportion of revenues in the GNP and revenues of the
central government out of total revenues to arrive at more solid
and balanced state finances.
</P>
<P>
To deal with problems arising from the Asian financial crisis
and decreased domestic demand, he says, the Chinese government is
pursuing an active financial policy designed to stimulate the
economy and market demand. But, from a mid-term and long-term
perspective, the government has to stick to an appropriately tight
financial policy with emphasis on increased revenues and thrift.
</P>
<P>
Future reforms in the finance and tax systems will focus on
getting rid of illegal fees and turning reasonable fees into
taxes, he says, and is asking for a greater effort in improving
the revenue-sharing tax system and the tax-collection practices.
</P>
<P>
He has also asked for improvements in the budget management
system by gradually establishing public budget, state-owned
capital, and social security budget systems, and an improved
social security system with a re-employment system, pension
system, medical-care system, and minimum wage system.

KAMPALA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's Defense People's

involvement in the Angolan civil war.
</P>

The UPDF clarified its stance Sunday in response to a Thursday
claim by an Angolan military source that some of the soldiers of
the National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) wore
Rwandan and Ugandan army uniforms, the New Vision reported

The paper quoted several senior UPDF officers as saying
Sunday, on condition of anonymity, that they were angered at the
Angolan claim.

They said they had no links with UNITA and saw this claim as
diverting attention from its increasing internal woes in face of

<P>
Rwanda and Uganda have been accused by Congolese President
Laurent Kabila of backing the Tutsi rebels fighting to topple his

</P>
<P>
Renewed fighting in Angola between UNITA and government troops

The foreign debt decrease was a result of the repayment of 115
million Dollars to external creditors and 83 million Dollars
disbursements, says the review.
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth consecutive month in which domestic debt
rose, the review says, adding that the rising debt is attributed
to the government's increased budgetary financing requirements as
well as the need to service external debts.
</P>
<P>
Of the 8.06-billion-Dollar public debt, domestic debt
accounted for 2.5 billion Dollars, or 31.8 percent of the total,
while the foreign debt stood at 5.5 billion Dollars, 68.2 percent
of the total,
</P>
<P>
The review notes that most of the foreign debt is long-term
and concessional. In terms of composition, three billion Dollars
were owed to multilateral creditors and 2.1 billion Dollars to
bilateral creditors, and the rest was in both commercial bank
loans and export credit.
</P>
<P>
The review says overall month-to-month inflation declined in
November, remaining within the single-digit range.
</P>
<P>
The inflation decline is attributed to the slowdown in the
expansion of money supply, the stability of the Shilling and the
improved supply of basic foodstuffs, particularly during the last
quarter of the year, according to the central bank report.

<HEADLINE> Southern Customs Undergoes Drastic Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Zhuhai, a special economic
zone which used to be a fishing village two decades ago, has
become the second largest entry and exit for international
travelers with the development of its Gongbei Port.
</P>
<P>
Gongbei Port is a large one with 12 docks. Between 1978 and
1997, travelers handled by the customs rose 49 times, increasing
from 590,000 to 2.96 million. In 1997, it handled 2.1 million
tons of cargo, 44.6 items more than that in 1978.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu Hao, head of the Gongbei Customs, the people
and cargo handled by the customs have undergone great changes
since the launching of the reform and opening up two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
Before the opening up, most of the people going through the
customs are those coming to see their relatives in the inland
area from Hong Kong and Macao. What they brought in were mostly
daily necessities and electronic appliances; they took out mostly
special local farm products.
</P>
<P>
Now people not only come from Hong Kong and Macao, but also
from elsewhere in the world. They come as tourists and business
people.
</P>
<P>
Liu said exports from the inland area two decades ago were
mostly farm products, sand and stones. Now exports also include
electronic and medical products as well as machinery.

<HEADLINE> New Drive Seen to End Burundi Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Efforts to negotiate the
lifting of two-year-old sanctions on Burundi have received a
fresh impetus following former Tanzanian president Julius
Nyerere's brief visit to Nairobi at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, who was appointed by the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) as the peace facilitator in the Burundi issue, held
talks with Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi Saturday over this
matter and other things, a Kenyan Foreign Ministry official
confirmed Monday.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere has reportedly managed to get both Tanzania's
President Benjamin Mkapa and Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni
to soften their opposition to the lifting of the sanctions, the
official, who refused to be named, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The new initiative comes in the wake of a rise in incidents of
sanction-busting by a business community frustrated by the
embargo.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Major General Salim Saleh, a brother to Museveni,
announced he was negotiating for a contract to supply meat worth
10 million U.S. Dollars to Burundi despite the embargo.
</P>
<P>
"I am in the advanced stages of negotiating the contract,"
Ugandan papers quoted Saleh as saying.
</P>
<P>
Although officials in the Kenyan, Ugandan and Tanzanian
ministries of foreign affairs said the sanctions are still on,
local media said that the lobby pushing for lifting of the
sanctions was gaining strength.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions were imposed on Burundi by east African states
in August 1996 following a Tutsi-led military coup staged by
Major Pierre Buyoya, which ousted the civilian government of
President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya.

<HEADLINE> China Sees Stable Rise in Coal Production and Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 21 (Xinhua) -- China expects to maintain
stable coal production and exports this year by turning out 1.35
billion tons of coal and exporting 35 million tons, according to a
senior official with the China State Administration of Coal
Industry.
</P>
<P>
These figures represent one-third of the world's total output,
and six percent of the world's total coal trade, respectively, the
official added.
</P>
<P>
At present, supply exceeds demand in coal markets both at home
and abroad, and the dwindling demand for coal in Southeast Asian
countries has affected China's coal exports.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chinese government has put in place a series of
supporting and encouraging policies and measures which have
effectively boosted the country's coal exports, said the official.
</P>
<P>
He noted that since the reshaping of the coal-industry system in
the first half of this year, China's coal mines have become more
growth oriented, while their staffs have been cut by a wide margin.
</P>
<P>
Statistics shows that some 870,000 workers and staff in key
coal mines have been laid off or transferred to other jobs over
the past five years.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, diversified economic operations have
contributed significantly to the sound development of coal mines
this year, said the official.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year, the country's coal-related diversified
economic enterprises is expected to grow to 17,000, employing a
total of over 1.8 million people.
</P>
<P>
He expects these diversified economic enterprises to produce
output value and economic returns totalling 44.5 billion yuan, or
57 percent of the total output value produced by coal.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Unions Welcome Copper Mines Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The Zambia Congress of Trade
Unions (ZCTU) has welcomed the sale of Nchanga and Nkana mines,
which account for two-third of Zambia's total copper mine assets.
</P>
<P>
ZCTU President Fackson Shamenda said here Sunday that if it is
true the sale of the mines has been concluded, it is a welcome
move as the mines are becoming a burden to the nation.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia newspaper Monday quoted him as saying that the
sale price is not important in comparison with burden the mines
have become.
</P>
<P>
Shamenda said recapitalization of the mines will help
reactivate economic activities of the country's copper industry,
which earns 80 percent of Zambia's foreign exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the donors will now release the money pledged as they
had been using the sale of the mines as a pre-condition for
funding.
</P>
<P>
"We only hope they will not come up with another excuse to
hold on to the money," he said.
</P>
<P>
The two mines together with Konkola mine have been sold to
Anglo-American Corporation (ACC) at the price of 72 million U.S.
Dollars and the new owner are expected to take them over by the
end of March next year, Zambian Finance Minister Edith Nawakwi
said last week.
</P>
<P>
In May this year, donors pledged to give the country an aid of
530 million Dollars. However, they have withheld the money to
press the Zambian government to speed up the privatization of the
Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM).
</P>
<P>
Due to disagreement over the cost of Nkana and Nchanga mines,
Zambia discontinued the negotiations with Kafue Consortium last
April over the sale of the two biggest mines in the country.
</P>
<P>
It was reported earlier that Zambia originally demanded 400
millions Dollars for the two mines from Kafue.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Enters Finance Arrangement With Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Monday signed
with Japan's Nomura International and the Sumitomo Bank Ltd. a
finance deal involving 74 billion yen (563.157 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's Second Finance Minister Mustapa Mohamed, Head of
Asia Oceania of the Nomura International Daisuke Takeuchi and
General Manager of International Finance of The Sumitomo Bank
Tsutomu Asano signed the documents in relation to the deal on
behalf of their respective authorities.
</P>
<P>
The structured finance arrangement involves the Malaysian
government borrowing the amount from the Sumitomo Bank with
Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)
issuing an insurance policy as collateral for the loan.
</P>
<P>
Of the loan, 90 percent or 66.6 billion yen (506.841 million
U.S. dollars) is funded by the issue of euro yen notes in capital
markets, which was arranged by Nomura International, while the
rest 10 percent or 7.4 billion yen (56.315 million U.S. dollars)
would be privately placed.
</P>
<P>
Mustapa said on the occasion that the structured loan
represented the first and only international market borrowing for
Malaysia this year.
</P>
<P>
He said the loan represented the first time that any country
had used the sovereignty of another country to raise funds from
the international capital market.
</P>
<P>
He said the loan is one of the several efforts on the Malaysian
part to raise funds to finance its economic recovery and the
proceeds of this loan will be used to finance development
projects.
</P>
<P>
Mustapa told reporters after the signing here that Malaysia had
also requested 5 billion U.S. dollars under Japan's Miyazawa
initiative to help countries affected by the economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
He said the Economic Planning Unit of the Prime Minister's
Department has made the request for the loan which would be used
to partly finance the 1999 budget deficit of 16.2 billion ringgit
(4.263 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Miyazawa initiative, announced in September and named after
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, is a 30 billion U.S. dollar
financial stimulus package mooted to help ailing Asian economies
affected by the prevailing financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Miyazawa plan is also meant to stabilize and revitalize the
financial system, provide social safety nets for the socially
handicapped, provide economic stimulus to create more jobs for
countries in trouble and cope with the credit crunch in affected
economies.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is also talking with some other multilateral agencies
to borrow money, Mustapa said without naming the agencies, adding
that he was not optimistic that the money would be gotten in the
near future.

BEIJING, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Minister in charge of
the State Economic and Trade Commission Zheng Silin said that
China will further implement industrial restructuring, cutting
out-moded spindles and closing small coal mines, reported the
China Reform News.
</P>
<P>
Zheng made these remarks in a report to 170 deputies of the
Chinese National People's Congress who have just concluded
investigations in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The restructuring will be focused on the textile industry,
said Zheng. About 4.5 million spindles for cotton-spinning will
be cut next year and the number of workers in the industry will
be reduced by 500,000. One million spindles for wool-spinning
will be cut in three years' time.
</P>
<P>
Next year, 25,800 coal mines will be closed and the output of
coal will be reduced by 250 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Zheng also said that the metallurgical industry will undergo a
readjustment in product mix. No new steel- and iron-producing
plants will be established until 2000, with a view to bring about
a better economic returns in the industry.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Zambian police is taking a
number of measures including mobilizing community to prevent the
escalating crimes in capital Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail Monday quoted inspector-general of police
Francis Ndhlovu as saying that "the recent attempts to disrupt
peace and security in Lusaka shall be addressed critically by
police."
</P>
<P>
He said the police have identified the cause of the rising
crime and that strong measures are being instituted aimed at
combating the scourge.
</P>
<P>
The division of Lusaka into manageable zones is one of the
measures by the police in order to intensify night patrols in
most inaccessible compounds where crime is prevalent, according
to him.
</P>
<P>
Ndhlovu said the the police could not adequately curb crime in
the past due to a shortfall of officers in the field and that his
command shall prioritize training of officers to correspond with
the escalation of crime.
</P>
<P>
There will be a heavy presence of police in compounds where
crime is mostly committed, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ndhlovu called on the public to report all crime incidents to
police in good time so that quick action will be taken to cope
with them.
</P>
<P>
Police alone cannot do much in preventing crime, unless the
community get fully involved, he noted.

<HEADLINE> China Unwraps Keyless Safe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese computer experts have
recently developed the country's first safe that opens upon
recognition of the right person's face.
</P>
<P>
The safe was developed by a team of computer experts at the
Department of Computer Science of Harbin Polytechnic University,
and has been granted patent rights.
</P>
<P>
The new safe does not require any key or password, said
Professor Yin Zhenliang, head of the team.
</P>
<P>
Yin said he hit upon the idea of the face-recognition safe
three years ago. At a local financial safety meeting, he was
approached by a banker. The banker suggested a keyless safe,
because the conventional safe is inconvenient. If there were more
than one person in charge of the safe, the lock had to be changed
when one person lost the key.
</P>
<P>
"To open the safe, you simply stand in front of it. The
personal computer connected to the lock looks at you through its
camera, and verifies your looks with the preinstalled information
about the owner's face," explains Yin at a demonstration.
</P>
<P>
He said the computer is accurate. Even twins can be
distinguished.
</P>
<P>
Some banks have already installed the keyless safe. Yin
expects more financial organizations to use the new product, as
most of the major banks have approached him to discuss the p
ossibility of cooperation.

Police Sunday told the Herald that among the dead were seven
people burnt in a bus crash near Bulawayo, the country's second

Preliminary investigations revealed that some of the drivers
involved in the accidents had not adhered to safe driving
practices. Some were found driving under the influence of
alcohol.

Police said there was a limit to what they could do to reduce
traffic accidents and that drivers shouldered the largest

</P>
<P>
As long as drivers flouted road traffic regulations and
neglected safety, Zimbabwe would continue to lose lives

<P>
URUMQI, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The people of the world's
second largest desert have begun to embrace modern life with their
television news every day and motor vehicles instead of camels.
</P>
<P>
Ten percent of the households of Daliyabuyi, the largest town
in the Taklimakan Desert, in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, have cars or trucks, but only 15 years ago,
they didn't even know how a truck worked.
</P>
<P>
They relied on candles for lighting until the early 1990s, but
now get world news from ground satellite stations on 4
Chinese-language channels and 5 Uygur-language channels. The town
has a population of 1,200.
</P>
<P>
More than 6,000 people in the 330,000-square-kilometer desert
were cut off from the outside world for centuries, until the
mid-1950s. A herdsman living on the rim of the desert needed half
a month to walk out of the desert where high dunes kept it
isolated.
</P>
<P>
Domestic animals and wildlife were the main food until the
first half of this century, when people began to get fruits and
flour after 1953, when officials of the new Yutian County
government sent food there.
</P>
<P>
When a road was built across the desert, the lives of people
there underwent great changes. Various commodities started to
appear, along with foreign tourists coming for desert expeditions.
</P>
<P>
Decades ago, a household with 10 family members usually had one
or two padded cotton quilts, but now a household has dozens of
woolen blankets, more than 20 quilts and about 5 carpets as well,
and over 90 percent of school-aged children receive an
education.

<HEADLINE> China Increasing Supervision Of Individual Incomes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 21 (Xinhua) -- China will increase
supervision of individual incomes for more stable and rapid growth
in taxes, according to today's overseas edition of People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
The paper says that tax work will focus on individual incomes
of foreigners and incomes from overseas, dividends of
stock-issuing companies and fund-managing companies, incomes of
individuals from house rents, and income from special consumer
sectors like dance halls, karaoke rooms, and beauty saloons.
</P>
<P>
Individual income taxes had rapid growth from January to
November, with 30.2 billion yuan (3.64 billion U.S. dollars) in
taxes assessed, an increase of 29.8 percent from the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
To reach its goal of 100 billion yuan this year, the State
Administration of Taxation recently asked tax departments to be
stricter.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Turbulent Year for South Africa's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Since the birth of a
new South Africa in 1994, not a single year has been so turbulent
economically as the year 1998. It began with hopes of strong
economic recovery but ends up heading for recession.
</P>
<P>
The economy was on a healthy track in the first few months of
the year with the steady decline in consumer and producer
inflation, relatively stable exchange rates of the Rand and good
trade figures.
</P>
<P>
Economists had predicted that the economy could well move out
of the shadow of slow growth pace in 1997 with several expected
interest rate cuts.
</P>
<P>
However, bad luck took over when international speculators
took on the Rand, causing the currency to plummet. In less than
three months, the Rand lost a quarter of its value.
</P>
<P>
The South African Reserve Bank at first tried to stabilize the
currency by selling U.S. Dollars, but it soon realized that it
was running out of money. The Central bank could not but opt to
use the lever of interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Owing to prolonged market turmoil, the Reserve Bank's repo
rate, the rate at which it lends to commercial banks, was raised
again and again, driving sky-high the lending rates of commercial
banks. The prime lending rates of commercial banks soared to 25.5
percent in late August, their highest level in more than a
decade. High interest rates dashed hopes of any meaningful
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The annual economic growth rate nose-dived to -2.3 percent in
the third quarter of the year after poor performance of 0.5
percent in the first quarter and 0.3 percent in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
When announcing its medium-term budget plan early last month,
the government had to revise the annual growth rate to 0.2
percent for the whole year from the projected 3.0 percent. The
budget deficit target was also revised down to 3.9 percent of the
GDP from 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
With soaring interest rates, inflation was also on the rise.
The consumer price index came down all the way since July 1997
and reached a 30-year low of 5.0 percent in April, 1998. But it
went up again, reaching 9.0 percent in October.
</P>
<P>
Trade figures this year were not satisfactory either. Last
year, South Africa enjoyed a trade surplus of 13.2 billion Rand,
which was worth 2.75 billion U.S. Dollars at the time. However,
by the end of September this year, it had a trade deficit of 111
million Rand (19 million Dollars).
</P>
<P>
South Africa's economic slump was blamed on the global
financial volatility caused by the financial crisis in southeast
Asia and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The crisis in southeast Asia depressed commodity prices on the
international market and South African exporters found their
goods less competitive. The crisis also significantly affected
South African exports to that part of the world. According to
statistics, South African exports to southeast Asia dropped 10.7
percent in the first eight months of 1998 compared with the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
South Africa could have suffered more if its exports to Europe
and the United States had not been improved.
</P>
<P>
With the end of the local market turmoil, South Africa's
economy seems to be stabilizing, with falling interest rates and
inflation, and better trade figures.
</P>
<P>
But local economists are cautious about economic prospects for
1999. The South African Chamber of Business (Sacob) forecast the
economy would grow by 1.5 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
Sacob chief executive Raymond Parsons said Tuesday that next
year should be seen as a year of consolidation. He warned that
the stabilization of the domestic economy was very tentative and
vulnerable to further shocks.
</P>
<P>
There are signs that the year 1999 would be difficult for
South Africans as the Asia contagion would continue to take its
toll and the global environment could not be improved
fundamentally.

<HEADLINE> Year-Ender: Angolan Peace Process Faltering Into </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The rumbling of gunfire has
shattered the hope of the implementation of Angolan peace
process, which should have been concluded this year in the
southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Since early December, fierce fighting in central Angola
between the government forces and the rebel troops of the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) has
resulted in the death of hundreds of people, while some 100,000
people have been forced to flee their homes.
</P>
<P>
As heavy weapons like tanks, long-range artillery and
surface-to-air missiles were used in the battles, Angolan Foreign
Minister Venancio da Silva Moura said last week that "the Angolan
peace process is at a crucial point and a full-scale civil war
may break out at any moment."
</P>
<P>
This is, no doubt, a failure to comply with the Lusaka
Protocol which aims at a lasting peace in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka peace accord signed in the Zambian capital in 1994
is a landmark which has ended two decades of civil war between
the government and UNITA and unfolded a new initiative for peace
efforts.
</P>
<P>
Three years after the agreement, a unified armed force and a
government of national unity and reconciliation have been formed,
with UNITA members formally sworn in in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, at the critical point of the Lusaka Protocol, UNITA
was reluctant to fully demobilize its army and refused to hand
over several key areas it occupies to the government as
prescribed in the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that the move indicates Jonas Savimbi,
Chairman of UNITA, and his supporters would not let go of the
"assets" they accumulated over the past 30 years. Moreover, the
protracted civil war has deprived the two sides of any trust of
each other. Now that the People's Liberation Movement of Angola
takes the state power in its hand, the UNITA could hardly imagine
assuming the role of "political opposition" under the roof of its
long-time foe.
</P>
<P>
Hence the peace process ran into a stalemate, with domestic
conflicts escalating and frequent maneuver of UNITA military
forces in an attempt to attack government controlled cities,
bringing the country to the fringes of crisis.
</P>
<P>
The death of U.N. special envoy to Angola, Alioune Blondin
Beye, in a plane accident forced the mediation work which Beye
had been so competent with to a virtual standstill. The Angolan
government, in despair, decided to deal a strong blow to Savimbi
who it believes is determined to wage an "armed struggle for
state power."
</P>
<P>
On September 1, the government announced the suspension of
UNITA members' positions in the government of national unity and
reconciliation as well as the parliament, forcing most of them to
express their willingness to stick to the peace process and
desert Savimbi by forming a splinter UNITA Renovation Committee.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government accused Savimbi of being "a war
criminal" and broke up all its contacts with the former rebel
movement. Instead, it recognized the UNITA Renovation Committee
as the only legitimate dialogist over the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The move, by causing division inside the opposition UNITA and
assuming the legality to "wipe out the armed bandits of Savimbi"
actually kills two birds with one stone.

<HEADLINE> Year-Ender: Angolan Peace Process Faltering Into </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
However, the move was not agreed to by the United Nations
mediators, who believe that despite the obstacles set up by
Savimbi to the peace process, Savimbi should be allowed one more
chance given the fact that he is one of the two signatories of
the Lusaka Protocol.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council in October, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said there had been "some negative
changes" recently in the Angolan situation, which "pose serious
threats to further advancing the peace process."
</P>
<P>
The words aroused strong complaints from the Angolan
government. Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos said in his
letter to Annan that "it has been proved by history many times
that Savimbi will not give up his war policy," and that Angolan
people are determined to "completely cast him aside" and
accomplish the rest of the tasks prescribed in the Lusaka peace
agreement together with the "patriotic UNITA Renovation
Committee."
</P>
<P>
The differences between Angolan government and the United
Nations worsened the situation in the peace process. U.N. new
envoy to Angola Issa Diallo could hardly start working since he
took office in late August.
</P>
<P>
Neither has the joint committee which consists of U.N., the
Angolan government, UNITA and the troika observer countries --
Portugal, Russia and the United States -- opened any session
since.
</P>
<P>
With escalating domestic conflicts, the government army
launched attacks at UNITA occupied areas in central Angola in
mid-November, and besieged Bailundo and A, where UNITA
headquarters are located.
</P>
<P>
UNITA, on the other hand, held about 15 U.N. peacekeepers as
virtual hostages. There were reports that UNITA had withdrawn
its main force to forest areas in the east, getting prepared for
long-time war with the backup of diamond resources in the Lunda
provinces.
</P>
<P>
To rid the war-torn country of deteriorating crisis, serious
negotiations were then held between the U.N. representative and
the Angolan government.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council approved a resolution on December 3,
citing the failure to implement Lusaka peace accord by the UNITA
leadership as the main cause for the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The resolution asked UNITA to demobilize its army
unconditionally and withdraw its forces from areas it took over
from the government.
</P>
<P>
It also urged UNITA to cooperate with the government
completely in a bid to promote the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council also renewed the mandate of its
peacekeepers in Angola for another three months in an effort to
prevent a return to war in the southern African nation.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government expressed its "satisfaction" toward the
resolution. However, it is still far from a compromised stand
accepted by both sides.
</P>
<P>
The recent armed clashes in central Angola which witnessed
dozens of tanks and long-range cannons on the UNITA side had been
reportedly a great setback to the government army.
</P>
<P>
According to local press reports that UNITA's Chairman Jonas
Savimbi, who was planning to announce victory on December 25, the
founding day of his party, had to start his action on December 1,
after the government became aware of UNITA's conspiracy and made
response to it.
</P>
<P>
The government and UNITA troops are now engaging in fierce
fightings in the central part of the country, where UNITA men
have taken control of a big part of Huambo and Bie provinces,
while the government forces have withdrawn to Huambo and Kuito,
capital cities of the two provinces after suffering heavy losses.
</P>
<P>
All signs indicate that the two sides are really in for it,
and therefore, currently there seems to be no end in sight to the
Angolan peace process.

JERUSALEM -- Despite various stimulation measures taken by the
government, Israel's economy is expected to rise by only 1.6
percent in 1998, the lowest in the decade due to an emerging
global economic shrink and a restrictive monetary policy
introduced more than two years ago.
</P>
<P>
The figure, given by the Israeli Finance ministry in its latest
report, is based on the country's GDP growth rates in the past
three quarters, namely 1.4 percent in the third quarter, 1.6
percent in the second quarter and 2 percent in the first three
months.

DHAKA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh Telegraph and
Telephone Board (BTTB) has made effective steps to modernize its
telephone systems to ensure that digital lines would be extended
to every subscriber in the country by the beginning of the new

</P>
<P>
There are about 230,400 telephone lines in the capital city of
Dhaka at present, including 168,900 digital lines and 61,500

<P>
COLOMBO, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The pollution taking place
along the sea coast of the city of Colombo poses a serious problem
needing urgent attention, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Colombo is the only city in Sri Lanka which has a pipe borne
sewage system, said Sarath Perera, director of Surveillance and
Monitoring Division of the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic
Resources Development.
</P>
<P>
He said all city sewage is drained to the sea without any
purification treatment due to the lack of refineries.
</P>
<P>
About 25 to 30 million gallons flow into the sea every day. The
13 pumping stations in the city divert the sewage to Madampitiya
in the north of Colombo to be released to the sea.
</P>
<P>
This sewage pipeline which has no refinery facility is over 100
years old. The water pollution affects not only the surface water
but also the underground water, he said.
</P>
<P>
Perera said Sri Lanka should follow a system similar to the
clean rivers system adopted in India where local technology at low
cost is used to prevent river, sea and water pollution.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Elected to Asia Pacific Telecommunity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 21 (Xinhua) -- A Sri Lankan
telecommunications expert has been elected as vice-chairman of the
Asia Pacific Telecommunity (APT) management committee at its 22nd
session held in Bangkok recently, the official Daily News reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report said the election of R.B. Kumarapathirana, director
of the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka, is
considered a recognition of Sri Lanka's leading position in Asian
telecom reform.
</P>
<P>
APT, the main institution of regional cooperation in
telecommunications, was set up in 1979 by an inter-governmental
agreement.
</P>
<P>
It is a unique meeting ground for representatives of
governments, regulators, telecom service providers and others
involved in the development of telecommunications, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Since its inception in 1979, the APT has been playing a leading
role in promoting the growth, enhancement of applications and
utilization of telecommunication services in the Asia Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka joined APT on November 1, 1979 and has been an active
member for the past nineteen years. In 1998 Sri Lanka hosted two
APT events, the first South Asian Telecom Regulatory Council
meeting and the Telecom Working Group for South Asia, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The APT management committee which meets once a year is
composed of 29 members, 4 associate members and 39 affiliate
members. It supervises the APT secretariat's functions, and
reviews and approves its work program, annual budget and accounts.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Mafia Godfather Shot Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Ivo Karamanski, 39, known as
"the Godfather of the Bulgarian Mafia," and his 28-year-old
bodyguard were shot dead early Sunday morning in a drunken brawl,
said the Interior Ministry press office.
</P>
<P>
Another two men, aged 33 and 44, were injured and hospitalized,
with one of them in critical condition, the office said.
</P>
<P>
Karamanski and his bodyguards were attending a party in Sofia's
Simeonovo suburb when the incident happened. A quarrel broke out
at around 2:20 a.m. local time on Sunday between drunken
Karamanski and one of the young men who organized the party, and
ended in shooting.
</P>
<P>
The suspected assailant escaped from the scene but was later
arrested.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses denied there had been a drunken row, said
investigator Emil Ivanov on Sunday. Stefan K., the suspect, fired
two shots from a Makarov pistol point-blank at Karamanski's head.
</P>
<P>
The motive of the suspect and whether he has a criminal record
were still unknown, police said, noting that the murderer and
Karamanski knew each other well.
</P>
<P>
Karamanski, a former rower on the national canoe-kayak team,
was the boss of the Korona insurance company, which was considered
as an insurance racket.
</P>
<P>
Karamanski was said to have been involved in many scandals over
shady business and violent crime. He was once arrested in Prague
for involvement in smuggling stolen cars and was remanded in
custody for 17 months in 1995 during an investigation into a
casino robbery.
</P>
<P>
The Special Investigative Service will work on Karamanski's
murder.

<HEADLINE> IOC New Selection System Looms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- International Olympic
Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch indicated that a new
way of selecting Olympic cities might be in place by next summer,
according to local reports here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The IOC president said that after the bribery scandal widened.
</P>
<P>
"After this scandal, I believe that the IOC as a whole must
accept that the system needs to change and that we can't continue
like this," Samaranch said.
</P>
<P>
A top IOC member, Switzerland's Marc Holder, has estimated
that 5 to 7 percent of the 115 members are open to bribery.
</P>
<P>
Hodler, a former head of the International Ski Federation, is
on the Sion 2006 Bid organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
His accusations of rampant corruption and vote-buying have
rocked the Olympic world.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch said IOC members found guilty of corruption will be
expelled from the organization.
</P>
<P>
"We are not happy with the way of selecting organizing cities
for the games," Samaranch said.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch said the Olympics should follow the example of other
major sports bodies, which leave significant decisions to their
executive committees rather than the full membership.
</P>
<P>
"But it's not easy to ask members to agree to cut off their
own heads," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the light of the current situation, he said it was possible
the IOC members would give the 11-member executive committee
special powers.
</P>
<P>
The new way may apply for the host of the 2006 Winter
Olympics. If successful, the same system would be used for the
2008 Games, he said.

<HEADLINE> Italy Urges to Reexamine EU Diplomatic, Security Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. and British unilateral
attacks against Iraq have called for a greater need for the
European Union (EU) to reexamine its joint diplomatic and security
policies, said the Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chambers of
Deputies, Dini said that the British participation in the U.S.-led
military operation against Iraq has "fully demonstrated that
British relations with the United States are more important than
its relations with the EU."
</P>
<P>
"Britain has not considered its relations with the EU members
as it participated in the attack," he added.
</P>
<P>
Britain had not notified its EU partners before it participated
in the U.S.-led Operation Desert Fox, a move Italy sees as a
challenge to the formation of the EU diplomatic and security
mechanism.
</P>
<P>
The Italian press believed that the mechanism has become the
most vulnerable part in the process of the EU unification.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Dini also wrote on the la Republica that after the
end of the military attacks, Italy will seek to improve the EU
diplomatic and security mechanisms so that the EU will act
unanimously under similar circumstances.
</P>
<P>
The Italian press said the U.S. military action with an EU
member while bypassing the United Nations, NATO (the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization) and EU has created political
disagreement among Western allies.
</P>
<P>
The EU members should realize that the American superpower
perception has threatened the process of the European unification,
the press added.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: What U.N. Will Do Next to Iraqi Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Washington and London's
announcement on Saturday night to end their four-day airstrikes
against Iraq came before the United Nations Security Council was
to make its first official reaction to what was seen here as a
violation of the U.N. Charter and the norms of the international
law.
</P>
<P>
At the time the United States and Britain started the military
strikes, the Security Council was convening closed-door
consultations on a report by chief U.N. arms inspector Richard
Butler, who accused Iraq of non-cooperation with U.N. arms
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council, shocked by the missile explosions in
Baghdad, held several rounds of emergent talks on the latest
development in the Iraqi crisis, but the council failed to make
any official response to the U.S.-led military action simply due
to strong objections from representatives of the United States and
Britain.
</P>
<P>
Washington and London used force against Iraq without the
authorization from the Security Council, thus posing a serious
challenge to the authority of the United Nations and the Security
Council, which has, under the Charter, primary responsibility for
the maintenance of international peace and security. The U.S.-led
strikes has immediately touched off worldwide condemnation.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member council has decided to meet again on Iraq at
10:30 a.m.(EST) on Monday, U.N. officials said. At present, a
repeated question here is What the council will do next to the
Iraqi crisis?
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the Security Council is expected to
focus its attention on the following sensitive issues.
</P>
<P>
First, the Security Council will discuss how to respond to the
military action against a sovereign country.
</P>
<P>
Sergey Lavrov, Russian permanent representative to the United
Nations, has had a draft presidential statement circulated among
council members, saying that the Security Council should take
action on the military action, which he said lacked legal
justifications. The draft called on the Security Council to lash
out at the military strikes.
</P>
<P>
China, France and Russia, three permanent members who had vote
power on the Security Council, are all against the military
action. At the same time, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who
responded to the military action by saying "This is a sad day for
the United Nations and for the world," said that he would think
about it "the morning after."
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the Security Council is expected to hold
consultations on the future arms inspections in Iraq. The
U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM), currently headed by Butler, is
in charge of disarming the Middle East country. In reality, at
issue is whether Butler should be sacked.
</P>
<P>
In his report to Annan, Butler said that Baghdad failed to
offer full cooperation with U.N. arms inspections. The report,
used by Washington as the main excuse to launch the attacks, met
with strong criticism from representatives of China and Russia who
said the Security Council that the report is one-sided and not
factual. Lavrov even took a step further to openly demand Butler
be replaced.
</P>
<P>
Butler shared his report with the U.S. government before it
"was formally delivered" to the U.N. secretary-general and the
Security Council, said a report last Friday by the New York Times
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"A full two days earlier, Mr. Butler had informed
Administration officials what he intended to say in his report and
when," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the military strikes ended, France put forward a
proposal to conduct "a profound review" of the relations between
Iraq and the United Nations, including a new way to deal with the
arms verification in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, the Security Council is expected to discuss Iraq's
compliance with the relevant U.N. resolutions since last crisis
was defused in mid-November.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia have both attacked the United States and
Britain who began the military action as Iraq resumed cooperation
with UNSCOM and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The
military strikes can not be justified and the U.S. statement and
Butler's conclusion on so-called Iraq's non-cooperation do not
hold water, observers said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan is in contact with 15
Security Council members on the crisis. Meanwhile, a number of
major members in the Security Council are also in touch with the
U.N. chief about what diplomatic steps should be taken next,
U.N. officials said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
However, one point has to be kept in mind. That is, the United
States and Britain, the two permanent members of the Security
Council, are still very tough on the issue of Iraq. Therefore, it
is really no easy job for the Security Council to make an official
response to the military strikes and safeguard its authority.

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua Police Seize 299 Kilograms of Cocaine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Some 299 kilograms of cocaine,
valued at 10 million U.S. dollars, have been seized at a border
check point in the southern province of Rivas, Nicaraguan police
announced Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The drug was discovered at dawn of Saturday when police made a
routine inspection on a truck, which came from Costa Rica and was
going to cross the Sapoa border into Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
Police seized the cocaine hidden in 299 separate packs. But the
truck driver fled while police were concentrating on their
inspection.
</P>
<P>
This was the third large drug haul captured by Nicaraguan
police this year. Police had seized 587 kilograms of cocaine in
January and 1611 kilograms in April.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that international drug gangs were using
Guatemala as a transit point for drug transportation, and drug
trafficking has been rampant along the Panama-Costa Rica-Guatemala
route in recent years.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Change Way Of Addressing Family Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The farmers of northwest
China's vast Loess Plateau have changed the way they address
family members and relatives to conform to popular changes in
cities.
</P>
<P>
Wang Haizhong, the 40-year-old head of the village of Tiancha
in Gansu Province, still calls his father "da" (a colloquialism in
the northwestern part China) as do most middle aged or older
farmers, but he has asked his son and daughter to call him "papa"
instead.
</P>
<P>
With the growth of education in rural areas and the influence
of the media and contact between rural and urban areas, more
farmers have changed the way they call their family members and
relatives.
</P>
<P>
The way husbands and wives address each other has become more
equal and civilized. In the past, farmers called their wives
"wuliren" (woman of the house), "poniang", (woman) or "mother of
my children", and the woman called her husband "zhangguide' (head
of the family), "man" or "father of my children".
</P>
<P>
Now, however, couples under 40 often replace the traditional
form with "husband" or "wife", or even calling each other
"laogong" and "laopo" or nicknames favored by urbanites.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Silk Is 5,500 Years Old </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists and
textile experts say that they have discovered scraps of silk
dating back 5,500 years in central China's Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists from the Zhengzhou Archaeological Research
Institute say that this pushes the history of Chinese silk back
1,000 years. Silk with a 4,500-year history has been found
previously in east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Songlin, a research associate at the institute says that
the silk items were discovered with more than 2,000 relics
unearthed in Xingyang, 40 kilometers away from the capital of
Zhengzhou. Archaeologists found pottery coffins for infants with
grey-white and grey-brown scraps of silk.
</P>
<P>
Scholars at the Shanghai Textile Research Institute say that
although the scraps of silk are 5,500 years old, they still have
the sheen of ordinary silk fibre.
</P>
<P>
The other relics included pottery and stone tools, pottery
knives, and bone needles. The archaeologists say that this is
evidence of China silk production early in the New Stone Age.

<HEADLINE> Italy Calls for Adjustment of EU Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The European Union needs to
adjust its foreign policy and security arrangements following the
members' dissonant views on the U.S.-British strikes on Iraq,
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Lower
House, Dini said Europe's dissonant views about the strikes and
EU's collective silence have highlighted an "emergency."
</P>
<P>
The justifications for the U.S.-British operation "Desert Fox"
against Iraq were debatable, he said.
</P>
<P>
Dini believed that London's participation in the U.S.-led air
attacks on Iraq constituted a clear choice of putting Britain's
relationship with Washington over its ties with the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Britain's choice came just a few days after an Anglo-French
summit in St Malo at which both sides said they looked forward to
creating a single "true and effective" identity on foreign policy
and defense, he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, in the Iraqi crisis, London "acted without
taking its membership of the European Union into account."
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton announced Saturday an end to four
days of missile and bomb strikes on Iraqi targets. U.S. defense
officials said the raids had inflicted "significant damage" to
Iraq's war machine.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless our initial doubts remain," said Dini, who has
questioned the usefulness of the attacks in recent days and called
for dialogue.
</P>
<P>
"They were certainly not decisions taken lightly," he said,
"but they were perhaps the wrong initiatives undertaken for
reasons which are nevertheless good."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Italian Defense Minister Carlo Scognamiglio said in
Milan that Europe's dissonant response to the Iraqi crisis
illustrated the need for the European Union to quickly find unity
in foreign policy and defense matters.
</P>
<P>
"We can't complain about not being taken into consideration if
we are not ready to pay the price," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senators Differ on Trial of Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 20 (Xinhua) -- With the impeachment of
U.S. President Bill Clinton now in their hands, senators vowed
Sunday to move quickly although they disagreed on the format --
speedy trial or immediate censure.
</P>
<P>
Democratic Party senators generally favored censure, while
Republican Party senators leaned toward at least a brief trial.
Both said the upper chamber of Congress had to restore civility
and "political sanity" to the process.
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe the challenge was faced adequately in the
House," Sen. Patrick Leahy, a Democrat, said on NBC's "Meet the
Press."
</P>
<P>
The president, meanwhile, prepared for a defense led by White
House Counsel Charles F. C. Ruff, with political guidance from
people such as former Democratic Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
"We have been talking to a number of different senators
including Senator Mitchell to get advice and counsel on how to
deal with the Senate," Greg Craig, coordinator of the White House
impeachment defense, said on "Fox News Sunday."
</P>
<P>
Sen. Orrin Hatch, a Republican, urged the current Senate
leadership to take a quick head count and determine whether there
is anything near the 67 votes required to convict Clinton.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the House of Representatives approved two articles
of impeachment, one charging the president with perjury, the other
with obstruction of justice in trying to cover up an affair with a
White House intern.
</P>
<P>
The matter was then referred to the 100-member Senate. The last
time the Senate held such a trial for the nation's chief
executive, in 1868, it acquitted President Andrew Johnson by a
single vote.
</P>
<P>
Hatch said on "Meet the Press" that if there aren't many more
than 55 votes against Clinton -- the number of Republicans in the
Senate -- "then there has to be some consideration to what do you
do that is the best under the circumstances to resolve this matter
and in the best interests of the country."
</P>
<P>
While that should include the start of a trial, said Hatch,
chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, there are other
options "where everybody could vote on this and vote their
conscience and it would be fair." He refused to offer details.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Mitch McConnell, a Republican, said the Senate was
obligated to hold a trial, but it could be tamed by taking
testimony from some witnesses in private.
</P>
<P>
"This will not be a spectacle," he said. "It will not demean
the Senate."
</P>
<P>
Sen. Christopher Dodd, a Democrat, said he backed censure
because a trial would "tie up three branches of government for the
next four months." William Rehnquist, chief justice of the United
States, would preside over a Senate trial presented by members of
the House.

<HEADLINE> From One-way Supply to Free Choices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 21 (Xinhua) -- When an elderly resident of
Shanghai, Lian Suqin, said, "Now I can make a choice," it pretty
much summed up the changes that have taken place in the lives of
Shanghai people over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
Lian, 67, explains that, in the past, most people lived the
same life in a designated circle, but that now they can live any
way they like and they all feel good about it. Each person used to
have a fixed work unit, each family had a designated place to buy
grain, and everyone used the same brand of soap and even studied
the same books.
</P>
<P>
Sociologists point out that at that time, the people of
Shanghai lived a kind of single-supply life and couldn't imagine
that freedom of choice was possible, even in consumer goods, and
could not imagine such rapid change taking place in the market
economy.
</P>
<P>
Lian says that there are plenty of fresh vegetables even during
winter months, and now it is necessary to make a choice before
buying any vegetables.
</P>
<P>
Even cosmetics have changed, and it's no longer just Friendship
brand Vanishing Cream, but CD, Kose, and Pond's as well.

<P>
PRAGUE, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Republic welcomed on
Sunday the end of the U.S. and British air strikes against Iraq,
said a Foreign Ministry statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the Czech government was "greatly
relieved" by the end of Operation Desert Fox, because the attacks
have brought considerable negative effects to the entire Islamic
world.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Czech Republic urged the Iraqi leaders,
President Saddam Hussein in particular, to unconditionally resume
cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM), saying that
this is the only reliable way leading to an end of the
U.N. sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Czech leaders expressed support to or understanding of the
launch of Operation Desert Fox.

<P>
DALIAN, December 21 (Xinhua) --The Dalian Port Authority of
northeast China's Liaoning Province and PSA Co. Ltd. of Singapore
have signed a contract to jointly rebuild the eastern part of the
Dalian Port.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time the two partners have cooperated,
having earlier collaborated in the construction of a container
berth near Dayao Bay in Dalian.
</P>
<P>
According to the contract, Dalian Marine Ltd., the new company,
will involve a total investment of 2.8 million U.S. dollars to be
shared equally by the two partners.
</P>
<P>
Local officials say that reconstruction of the eastern part of
the port of Dalian will focus on moving existing cargo transport
berths out of this section and moving them to newly expanded port
areas such as Dayao Bay. The effort also aims to turn the eastern
part into a tourism, passenger transport, and commerce and trade
area.
</P>
<P>
The new company will soon work out a detailed plan for
developing the eastern part in accordance with Dalian's urban
development blueprint, and organize investment promotion
according to international standard practices.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 21 (Xinhua) -- A recent study in Shanghai
has found that the city will become a battleground for 400
furniture businesses from the U.S. and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Furniture companies from the U.S., Britain, Italy, Germany,
France, Australia and other western countries have expressed a
desire to compete in Shanghai's furniture market.
</P>
<P>
Since the early '90s, furniture sales in Shanghai have grown at
least 20 percent annually, far exceeding the average of 8 percent
nationally, and annual international furniture fairs for the past
two years have done a billion yuan (120 million U.S. dollars) in
business each.
</P>
<P>
Italy took the lead in entering Shanghai's furniture market and
the products of more than 100 Italian furniture companies can be
found in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
In September, a team from 7 Western furniture enterprises made
a special trip to the Shanghai Business Center and signed up for
4,000 sq.m. of space for an exhibition.
</P>
<P>
A Shanghai furniture group plans to open an 800 sq.m. hall by
next February to display the products of 50 leading U.S. furniture
businesses. The group also plans to build a 12,000 sq.m. shopping
mall to sell U.S. furniture.

RIO DE JANEIRO, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Corinthians drew with
Cruzeiro 1-1 in the second leg of the three-match Brazilian
championship final on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Under the intricacies of the championship, Corinthians need
only to draw Wednesday's third leg, when they will again have
home advantage, to win the title for the second time. Last week's
first leg had ended in a 2-2 draw.
</P>
<P>
Marcelinho Carioca of Corinthians scored a goal early in the
second half with his 18th goal of the championship.
</P>
<P>
But Cruzeiro levelled the score 10 minutes later through
striker Marcelo Ramos.
</P>
<P>
Cruzeiro dominated the later stages but the Corinthians
defence was excellently marshalled by Carlos Gamarra.
</P>
<P>
The tie is decided on points, then on goal difference and
finally first stage records. Corinthians need only a draw on
Wednesday as they won the first stage, which also gives them home
advantage for the decisive match.

SHENZHEN, December 21 (Xinhua) -- China is preparing to launch
a 30,000-cubic meter weather balloon on January 1, 1999 to monitor
the atmospheric ozone layer across the country over the next three
to five years.
</P>
<P>
According to officials, it will be the world's first balloon
sent to a 30,000-meter altitude to monitor the ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
China will also launch a second smaller balloon, of some
1,000-cubic meters, next February for the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
The monitoring program has been initiated by the Institute of
Atmospheric Physics attached to the Chinese Academy of Sciences in
partnership with a foreign refrigerant producer.
</P>
<P>
Reports indicate that damage to the ozone layer is one of the
world's three major environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to help protect the vital ozone layer, China has now
decided to gradually stop the production of refrigerant and
foaming agents containing carbon fluorine chlorine which destroys
ozone.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen Expecting High Growth in Offshore Banking Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The booming financial center
of Shenzen in south China is forecasting that by the end of this
year it will have enjoyed a 20 percent growth rate of its offshore
banking business, while bankers in other Asian countries are
suffering a lacklustre period because of the Asian financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen has five of China's six banks authorized to handle
offshore foreign currency transactions. They reported 2.3 billion
U.S. dollars of outstanding offshore deposits in total at the
beginning of this year and more than 2 billion dollars of
outstanding loans, up 24.9 percent and 23.7 percent respectively
on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
"This year, the business has retained its growth momentum and
we predict a sustained increase for the next year," said Li
Danming, a policy adviser in Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the city has learned the framework of its
offshore banking operations from Hong Kong, and now hopes to take
advantage of its proximity to the international financial center
to enlarge its market share.
</P>
<P>
Li has been involved in a government scheme for assessing the
possibility of making one or two Chinese banks specialists in
offshore foreign currency trading.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the success of an offshore banking center
depends largely on its attraction to foreign financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
On this point, Shenzhen has shown its potential, Li said. It is
now a home to 27 overseas financial institutions and 21 overseas
financial representative offices from 12 countries and
regions. Their combined financial asset value has accounted for a
quarter of the city's total foreign currency assets.

<P>
BEIJING, December 21 (Xinhua) --As a result of the burgeoning
superhighway and modern telecommunications Chinese people are
sending fewer letters by traditional post and turning instead to
faxes, phone calls and increasingly e.mails.
</P>
<P>
China Business Daily reports that the amount of postal
letters was down by 12.8 percent in 1997 from the previous year
and dipped even further during the first quarter of this year by
another 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report said that 55 percent of mailed letters are private
with 40 percent from the business sector or printed material.
</P>
<P>
However, it went on to urge Chinese companies to use the postal
service while saying that in advanced countries, 90 percent of the
mail is printed material.
</P>
<P>
But a recent survey discovered that large companies, which are
less inclined to use printed materials, prefer radio, TV and
newspapers for marketing their products and services.

<HEADLINE> Telegram Business Decreasing But It's Not Dead Yet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The telegram business is
shrinking because of more modern means of telecommunications like
mobile phones, faxes, and e-mail, Guangming Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
Telegrams have been losing ground since 1985. Before that, 3
million telegrams used to bring in half of Beijing Telecom's
revenues monthly. That number plunged to just over 400,000 a month
by 1996, and just over 4,000 a month in October of this year.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper reports that more than half of the people in
telegram offices have found other kinds of work.
</P>
<P>
Yang Cuiping, chief of the telecommunications section of the
Yong'an Road Post Office in eastern Beijing, told the newspaper
that the telegram business has shrunk 30 percent annually over the
past decade. She says that during the '80s, the office sent 1,200
telegrams a day but the daily record is now only around 50, and
their telegram employees have gone from over 50 people to around
10.
</P>
<P>
However, Yang says, the telegram business is not going to die
out in the foreseeable future in China because some remote and
mountainous areas don't have access to modern telecommunications
facilities and still rely on telegrams.
</P>
<P>
The old business is also trying to adopt new methods and has
come up with "courtesy telegrams" for New Year's, birthday, and
marriage celebrations.

Sunday the first World Cross-Country Challenge races for the
1998-1999 season.
</P>
<P>
Limo Richard, a 25-year-old Kenyan running his first World
Cup, won the 10,500-meter race in a time of 32 minutes 14

More than 100 runners from 26 countries competed in the men's
race while more than 60 women from 17 countries competed in a
6,000-meter race of their own, of which Wami Gete of Ethiopia won
in 20:17.
</P>
<P>
Eight seconds adrift at 20:25 was Sandell Annemarie of Finland
while Worku Ayelech of Ethiopia came home third in 20:34.
</P>
<P>
Limo told the press after the race that he felt a bit pushy in
his left hip joint while running the race and that it may be
caused by his nervousness in his first major event and his first
race in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Unlike last year's event that was held in chilly rains, this
year's race was held in an unusual sunny weather for Sunday's
crowd of thousands.

<HEADLINE> Arsenal Claims First Victory in League Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Defending champions Arsenal
claimed their first victory in six Premier League matches by
beating Leeds United 3-1 at Highbury on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The win kept Arsenal within four points of league leaders
Chelsea, which beat Tottenham Hotspur 2-0 on Saturday to go top
for the first time in nine years.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal went ahead against the run of play when Dennis
Bergkamp latched on to a precise 40 meter pass by Emmanuel Petit
and chipped into the net in the 28th minute.
</P>
<P>
They made it 2-0 early in the second half with a powerful shot
by Patrick Vieira following more good work by Petit, returning
from injury for his first game since November 21.
</P>
<P>
Leeds reduced the deficit in the 66th minute when Jimmy Floyd
Hasselbaink drove in a 20 meter shot of stunning ferocity.
</P>
<P>
But Arsenal, who blew a 2-0 lead last week when they lost 3-2
to Aston Villa, finished the stronger. They missed several good
chances before Petit finished off a sweeping move with a first
time shot eight minutes from time.
</P>
<P>
The game ended on a sour note for Arsenal as French substitute
Gilles Grimandi was sent off for butting Leeds youngster Alan
Smith in the 86th minute.
</P>
<P>
The result lifted Arsenal one place to sixth, four points
behind leaders Chelsea and Aston Villa, who play Charlton
Athletic on Monday. Leeds remain fifth.

<HEADLINE> Miriona Moeva Swims 85,617.5 Meters in 24 Hours </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sofia, December 20 (Xinhua) - Bulgarian Miriona Moeva will be
included in the Guinness Book of Records as the woman who swam
the longest distance in a 25-meter pool in 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
She swam 85,617.5 meters without leaving the pool from 6pm on
Saturday to 6pm on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Miriona accomplished a feat. I don't know if I can do the
same. I will inform the organizers of swimming marathons at sea
of her achievement because I'm sure she will represent Bulgaria
around the world just as well as I can," marathon swimmer Peter
Stoichev, who swam alongside Moeva most of the time, told BTA.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian Swimming Federation received a letter from the
Guinness Book publishers, saying that so far records had been set
under non-standardized conditions and swimming marathon
achievements would have to be recorded from scratch.
</P>
<P>
"We met the Guinness requirements for refereeing and pool
size, therefore Moeva's achievement will be registered as a
record. The papers will be sent on Monday," the Federation's
Stefan Zlatarov said.

<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- The Howard government's decision to sneak in regulations
over the Christmas/New Year period allowing small firms to sack
new staff without fear of legal reprisal has backfired, with the
Senate now certain to overturn the move.
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- The threat of further military strikes hung over Iraq Sunday
night as the United States and Britain declared an end to the
campaign in which more bombs exploded than during the 1991 Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review:
</P>
<P>
-- The Business Coalition for Tax Reform may recommend the

<HEADLINE> Malone Likes Offer by NBA Owners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Karl Malone said the NBA
owners have made a "decent" contract proposal and the Utah star
hopes the union to accept it in order to save the season.
</P>
<P>
"To me, I feel the deal is almost done," Malone said. "Without
a doubt, that deal is fair. It just needs some minor changes. I
think the deal is decent."
</P>
<P>
Malone said he thought the proposal reached him last Thursday
was actually sent by the union. It wasn't until he got to the
last page and saw commissioner David Stern's name that he
realized it was the league's offer.
</P>
<P>
But union director Billy Hunter still blames the owners and
did not accept the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Hunter said no new negotiations are scheduled between him and
Stern. Sunday is the eighth day since the last round of
bargaining, and players continue to lose $50 million a week in
salaries as the lockout continues.
</P>
<P>
"I don't care if it's 40 or 50 games. You all can call it a
shortened season, but I still want a championship. And to me, a
championship is a championship," Malone said.
</P>
<P>
Hunter wrote in an analysis of the league's proposal that
Stern was telling only half the story and the NBA's proposal
represents steps backwards from the freedom and benefits.
</P>
<P>
"I think the players have been directed on a tragic course,"
Stern said. "Hunter continues to counsel an intransigent stance
on the assumption the owners will hold the season at any cost.
</P>
<P>
Sadly, he's going to be wrong. In light of Billy's comments to
his players and the position it represents make cancellation of
the season virtually inevitable."

<HEADLINE> NBA Star Anderson Faces Prison for Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Greg Anderson, a NBA star
in the Hawks team, faces a maximum of 40 years in prison for
participating in a cocaine deal.
</P>
<P>
He blamed bad judgement and a poor choice of friends for his
fate. The NBA veteran believed he would probably serve three to
four years in prison whith no chance for parole.
</P>
<P>
"They caught me red-handed," said Anderson, who has spent 10
years in the NBA. He was a first-round draft pick by the San
Antonio Spurs in 1987, and played for Milwaukee, Denver, Detroit
and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
"I could have said, 'No,' I could have stopped this. But I
didn't. I'm not in a state of thinking, 'Why did this happen?' I
should have been saying tht before it happened. I should have
said a lot of things before it happened."
</P>
<P>
Anderson and three others pleaded guilty on October 20 to
possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.
