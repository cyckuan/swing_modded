The meeting, which lasted 11 days and was concluded on Monday,
decided to reopen five key streets including the Main Port Road,
El-gab, Afisiyoni, Waberi and the Labour House Road.

WASHINGTON -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told
U.S. President Bill Clinton on Monday that he is willing to hold
peace talks with Syria, but ruled out a pullback from the Golan
Heights as a precondition for negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters after the one-hour meeting at the White House
that Clinton "fully understands our position" and promised to try
to get the negotiations going.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu asked Syria not to have a "fixed position" if it
wanted to see the talks that broke down last May reopened,
indicating Syria should relinquish the "land-for peace" formula,
implicitly agreed by the former Israeli Labor government.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iran today announced that it faces the danger of two
million Iraqi refugees pouring into the country due to the latest
fighting in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>

the Iraq refugees will swarm into the country through three
Iranian provinces of West Azarbaijan, Kermanshah and Kurdestan.
</P>
<P>
He said that the number of refugees with immediate danger of
pouring into Iran is 200,000 in the short run, but the final

<HEADLINE> Hashimoto, Ota Discuss U.S. Bases and Economic Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto and Okinawa Governor Masahide Ota met here today for
talks on the issue of U.S. military bases and regional development
of the southernmost island prefecture.
</P>
<P>
During the 75-minute meeting, Hashimoto offered Ota a special
state budget outlay of five billion yen (50 million U.S. dollars)
to revitalize the prefecture's economy in a bid to quell
objections by Okinawan citizens to the huge U.S. military presence
on the island.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto also vowed to work for a cut in U.S. military bases
and unveiled plans to form a special government policy panel to
deal with the issue.
</P>
<P>
The meeting followed Sunday's unprecedented prefectural
referendum in Okinawa in which an overwhelming majority of voters
said yes to cuts in U.S. military bases in their home town.
</P>
<P>
It also came amid two pending legal battles between Hashimoto
and Ota over the expropriation of privately owned plots of land
for the U.S. military use.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a nationwide televised press conference after
meeting with Ota, Hashimoto said the panel will include the
Okinawa governor and central government officials concerned.
</P>
<P>
The panel will grapple with how to reduce the
disproportionately large presence of U.S. military bases in
Okinawa and how to promote the development of the prefecture, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Okinawa, about 1,600 kilometers southwest of Tokyo, is home to
about 28,000, or 60 percent of the 45,300 U.S. soldiers stationed
in Japan.
</P>
<P>
It also harbors 75 percent of U.S. military facilities in the
country, although the prefecture occupies only 0.6 percent of
Japan's land area.
</P>
<P>
"I think I can succeed in building confident relations with the
prefectures," Hashimoto said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister released a statement, adopted by a hastily
convened cabinet session following the talks, which represented
the government's commitment to cuts in U.S. bases and the
development of the prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Okinawa has the highest unemployment rate and lowest per capita
income in the nation partly because of the U.S. military's
occupation of a tenth of its land area.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ota welcomed the central government's economic
development measures and hoped they would be implemented.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a separate press conference after his talks with
Hashimoto, Ota said, "We are delighted that almost all of the
requests by the prefectural side were seriously taken up in the
central government's measures."
</P>
<P>
"We also feel relieved to see that the measures are backed by
the state budget," he said.
</P>
<P>
The governor said neither he nor Hashimoto brought up the issue
of land expropriation for use by the U.S. military during the
meeting at the premier's official residence.
</P>
<P>
Okinawa's deep-rooted resentment to the U.S. military presence
was fueled by the rape of a local schoolgirl by three
U.S. servicemen last September.
</P>
<P>
Since then Ota, a vocal advocate of the total withdrawal of
U.S. troops, has spearheaded a campaign against the central
government by refusing to carry out legal procedures needed for
the continued forced land leasing.

<HEADLINE> Author of "Little Prince" Keeps Intriguing France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 10 (Xinhua) -- More than half a century after
his mysterious disappearance during a war mission into occupied
France, legendary writer-pilot Antoine de Saint-Exupery still
fascinates the country.
</P>
<P>
French Television Channel 3 is airing a new documentary about
the author of "Little Prince" -- a fairy tale which is still one
of the most popular novels in all countries -- to show "the
unsuspected modernity of his reflection and his confusion in
facing the world," the TV station said.
</P>
<P>
The documentary, one of a series about 20th century writers,
will "elaborate with the aid of archives an emotional portrait of
the author of `Land of Men.'"
</P>
<P>
The film was made after numerous but fruitless efforts were
made recently to recover the plane he flew with on his last
mission in July 1994.
</P>
<P>
Born near Lyon in 1900, Saint-Exupery was a man of action as a
pilot. He opened air courier lines between Europe and South
America and flew many times over the Sahara Desert.
</P>
<P>
He was also a philosophical man whose numerous works include
Little Prince, Land of Men, South Courier, War Pilot, A Letter to
Storm and Citadel, all of which have become a source of immense
pride in France.
</P>
<P>
He believed that men should have strict self-discipline to
cultivate the "only luxury which is human relations," and should
have the courage to make sacrifices for the good of the entire
community. He put this into action by dying on a war mission.
</P>
<P>
In "Little Prince," he urged people to love "the little star"
which they inhabit and "which is already the life of spirit".

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Official Disappointed over Talks with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Saeb Erekat, chief
Palestinian negotiator with Israel, has expressed disappointment
over the meeting of the joint Israeli-Palestinian Steering
Committee held in the West Bank town of Jericho Monday, reported
Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
He complained in Jericho today that the Israeli team, headed by
former Chief of Staff Dan Shomron, came to the talks without any
powers, but only to buy for time.
</P>
<P>
Erekat, who is also Palestinian Authority minister of local
government, told the radio that contrary to the Israeli media
reports, the Palestinian side had not agreed to modifications to
Israeli army redeployment in the West Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians demand that the new rightwing Israeli Likud
government should fully commit itself to Israel's obligations of
the Oslo 2 agreement by accomplishing the task to pull out from
Hebron. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has tried to make
some changes in the plan left over by the Labor government.
</P>
<P>
Erekat noted that all the issues relating to the implementation
of the agreement signed between Israel and the PLO should not be
modified and nothing in the agreement should be touched. "This was
very clear to the Israeli and our sides. Because if we start
opening parts to the agreement, that will mean we end our
agreement," he added.
</P>
<P>
Erekat hoped that both sides will try to put the peace process
back on track and are determined to carry out the implementation
of the agreement on the ground.

<HEADLINE> 2,000 Iraqi Refugees Swarm into Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Some 2,000 Iraqi Kurdish
refugees crossed the Iranian border into Tilekouh region in the
city of Sarpolzahab following clashes in northern Iraq, an
official report said here today.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that the refugees
Monday crossed into the Iranian soil aboard dozens of heavy
and light vehicles or on foot.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Iran had supplied them with food and
drinking water immediately after their arrival.
</P>
<P>
However, the report added that patients and pregnant women
needed health care facilities, foodstuff and medicine.
</P>
<P>
Some refugees said that over 10,000 more refugees are to
arrive soon at the Iranian border.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Interior Ministry said here today that Iran prefers to
offer its humanitarian assistance to Iraqi refugees inside the
Iraqi territory.
</P>
<P>
But the ministry claimed that Iran's current policy was to
admit no new refugees to its territory.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that about 200,000 out of the 800,000 Kurds,
who had fled their homes in northern Iraq, are scattered across
Iranian border with Iraq, said the ministry.

<HEADLINE> Historic Peace Agreement Signed in Central </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Elders from Hussein
Aidid's clansmen of Habar Gidir and those of Ali Mahdi's Abgal
clan have adopted peace resolutions at the end of a straight
forward peace making conference in Bermuda District of central
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which lasted 11 days and was concluded on Monday,
decided to reopen five key streets including the Main Port Road,
El-gab, Afisiyoni, Waberi and the Labour House Road.
</P>
<P>
The first ever peace conference between the two clans called
for the dismantling of all clan manned road blocks in city
districts of Waberi, Hodon, Hamar Jajab and Hamar Weyne.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to form a representative office
which will organize the peace making efforts.
</P>
<P>
A committee has been formed to monitor the reopening of the
closed roads in Bermuda. The committee called on all people who
took refuge elsewhere during the civil war to return to their
houses.
</P>
<P>
The committee also urged the public transport buses to restart
their business in the area so as to encourage the free movement.
More than 40 percent of Bermuda buildings have been destroyed
during the faction warfare.
</P>
<P>
A joint communique issued at the conclusion of the meeting
said a fine of 300 U.S. Dollars would be imposed on anybody
caught to have fired a single shot after the peace document is
signed.
</P>
<P>
The meeting adopted the use of Islamic Sharia laws in all the
civil cases within their communities. A person who kills another
in their community will be executed in public according the
Islamic regulations, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
Under the signed agreement, all armed wagons will be banned
inside Bermuda District except for those officiated by the joint
office, the communique added.
</P>
<P>
For the last five years, Bermuda has been a battle field for
Abgal, Habar Gidir and Murusade, the three strongest clans of
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Being the most volatile part of the capital since fighting
began in late 1991, the district took its name after the Bermuda
Triangle for its dangerous nature.
</P>
<P>
Abgal and Murusade clans in Bermuda community already signed a
peace agreement three months ago.
</P>
<P>
The latest peace accord between Habar Gidir and Abgal will
pave the way for the smooth flow of traffic and humanitarian
assistance for Bermuda, which has remained isolated ever since
1991.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe another agreement is possible for reopening
the main port of Mogadishu nearly a year after it closed in
factional fighting in October last year.
</P>
<P>
At the peace conference, the Habar Gidir clan was represented
by 20 elders and intellectuals led by Ugas Mire Mohamed Duale
while their counterpart Abgals of the same number led by the
chairman of the conference, Ahmed Hassan Hiin.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani Rupee Devaluated to Enhance Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The State Bank of Pakistan
(SBP) today devalued the Pakistani rupee by 3.65 percent in an
attempt to increase the competitiveness of Pakistani exports in
international market.
</P>
<P>
Rupee was lowered by 1.36 rupees against the US dollar to
36.9700 and 37.1549 rupees for one dollars for spot buying and
selling respectively.
</P>
<P>
Rupee has experienced six downward technical corrections since
July 1, the beginning of the new fiscal year, which have brought
down the value of rupee by 1.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in Pakistan's economic center of
Karachi today, SBP Governor Muhammad Yaqub said today's
readjustment was necessary in the present conditions as the
country's exports have not become competitive in international
market.
</P>
<P>
"This action is to strengthen, not to weaken the economy of the
country," he was quoted as saying by the Associated Press of
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He said the readjustment would certainly increase the inflation
and prices, but this would not affect the overall economy of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The SBP calculations indicate that the readjustment would
increase the consumer price index by 0.52 percent above the
original scenario for the year, and the Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) deflator by 0.80 percent, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the readjustment would also end the speculative
increase of dollar in kerb market.
</P>
<P>
The SBP had been reducing rupees bit by bit, but it caused
speculative increase of dollar rate in open market.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the rate of dollar would reduce in open market,
which was increased by more than 10 per cent as against the
official rate.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone Police Investigate Coup Plotting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
FREETOWN, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The police in Freetown#,
capital of Sierra Leone continue their interrogation of three
junior rank soldiers for the third day who have been accused of
plotting to overthrow the civilian government of President Tejan
Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
Two of the three were identified today as Staff Sergeant
Salifu Mansaray and Private Samuel Winston who has just returned
from Monrovia where he was on assignment with the west African
peace keeping force (ECOMOG). The third has not yet been
identified.
</P>
<P>
Investigators said the three are former bodyguards to Lt
Colonel Reginald Glover, former secretary of state for mineral
resources, who was among the 26 military officers retired by
Kabbah last week.
</P>
<P>
Gover, who now lives in the United States, was a key figure
in the military governments of Capitain Valentine Strasser and
Brigadier Julius Maada Bio.
</P>
<P>
Family sources in Freetown have denied any link of Glover to
the alleged plot.
</P>
<P>
According to police sources, the plot was aborted on Sunday
night as the three suspects were finalizing plans for the coup on
Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Military intelligence, according to reliable sources, first
discovered the plot last month when a cache of arms were
allegedly found in the residence of Glover in Freetown.
</P>
<P>
The sources, disclosing the plans for the plot, said Kabbah's
residence would have been attacked at 4 am Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah has reacted to the coup plot, saying I "came as no
surprise."
</P>
<P>
"I shall not be intimidated," he told the speaker of
parliament Judge Syl Kutubu who called on him with several
parliamentarians to show sympathy.
</P>
<P>
Freetown remains calm with shops and markets functionaing
normally. A senior government spokesman said on Tuesday that the
government "is leaving all investigations to the police."

province of Ningarhar, said a report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan Islamic Press reported that the Taliban entered

<P>
Hisarak is a strategic center which controls the access to
Sarobi, about 75 kilometers east of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban had declared earlier that Sarobi would be its main
military target in the near future.
</P>
<P>
However, the Afghan government said today that its forces in
Hisarak had repulsed the Taliban's offensive and there was no
worry about the defense of Sarobi as several thousands of the

LUSAKA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Unionized workers at the
Zambia News Broadcasting Corporation (ZNBC) studios in Lusaka and
Kitwe are continuing their strike today, defying warning from the
ZNBC board of directors.
</P>
<P>
However, Joseph Mwaba, vice-president of the National Union of
Communication Workers, reiterated that theirs was a mere
withdrawal of labor and not a strike.
</P>
<P>
He called on his members to remain calm until they receive
further instructions from their National President Neddy Nzowa
who is to arrive in Lusaka from Ndola later in the day.
</P>
<P>
Scores of paramilitary police in full riot kit have been
deployed at the Mass Media Complex in Lusaka to keep vigil should
the strikers turn violent.
</P>
<P>
The strikers have been barred from entering the Mass Media
Complex and they were seen milling around the main gate waiting
for an address by their president.
</P>
<P>
The ZNBC workers began strike on Monday to press their demand
for the removal of ZNBC Director General Duncan Mbazima, accusing
him of being sensitive to the welfare of the workers.
</P>
<P>
Mbazima is on forced leave together with Director of Programs
Frank Mutubila.
</P>
<P>
Laurah Harrison, ZNBC board chairperson and permanent
secretary of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, said
on Monday that the workers' strike was uncalled for as the board
was investigating their grievences.
</P>
<P>
She termed the strike as illegal and urged the workers to
return to work by not later than 8:00 am on Wednesday otherwise
they will risk to terminate their employment with the ZNBC.
</P>
<P>
She said security at the corporation had to be stepped up
because of the sensitive nature of the corporation and its
facilities.

LUSAKA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Minister of Tourism
Gabriel Maka said here today that Zambia should maintain the
status quo on the international ban in the trade of ivory and
other elephant parts to keep the population of elephants stable.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when officiating a national workshop on
the management planning process of the Kafue National Park.

He said that the government fully supports the ban on
international trade of ivory and other elephant parts because

HARARE, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe has exported over
100,000 tonnes of maize this year, the Grain Marketing Board
(GMB) said here today.

A senior GMB official said at least 250,000 tonnes of maize

It is now safe to export maize since the country has a surplus

<P>
AMMAN, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan
received today a message from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu on re-arrangement to facilitate trade exchange including
transport between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The message was delivered by Israeli Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister of Tourism Moshe Kasaf during his meeting today here with
the Crown Prince.
</P>
<P>
The meeting discussed tourism activities between the two
countries under the peace treaty Jordan and Israel signed in
October 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli minister briefed the Crown Prince on the draft
projects to be presented to the Middle East and North Africa
economic summit to be held in Cairo in November.
</P>
<P>
Kasaf, who arrived here Monday as head of a tourism delegation
on a visit to the kingdom, signed Monday with his Jordanian
counterpart Saleh Irsheidat an agreement on a mechanism to expand
the marketing of joint tourism packages in line with a tourism
accord signed between the two countries in April last year.
</P>
<P>
The most tangible outcome of the meeting was the creation of a
joint technical committee to tackle bilateral as well as
multilateral issues of concern to the tourism industry of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to exchange information and tourism
statistics, policies and surveys.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, around 110,000 Israelis visited
Jordan in 1995 and 56,000 in the first eight months of this year,
representing a seven percent increase over the same period for the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Only 14,000 Jordanians visited Israel last year, the bulk of
them as members of tour groups organized by private operators.
</P>

No figure was immediately available on Jordanian visitors to
Israel so far this year.

<HEADLINE> Bahrain Boycotts GCC's Doha Summit, But Not </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 10 (Xinhua) -- A Bahraini Minister has
disclosed that his country's decision not to participate in the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) summit conference, due to take
place in the Qatari capital city of Doha in December, does not
mean that Bahrein is boycotting the GCC.
</P>
<P>
The Bahraini press today quoted Minister of Cabinet Affairs
and Information Mohammed al-Muttawa as having told newsmen that
Bahrain's attitude toward the Doha summit reflected Bahrain's
dissatisfaction with taking the Bahraini-Qatari border disputes
to the International Court of Justice.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain, he said, adheres to the principle of resolving
differences through regional framework and within the Gulf home.
</P>
<P>
He added that Bahrain is providing the full opportunity for
Saudi Arabian mediation with the object of reaching a fraternal
solution that preserves the ties of brotherhood, friendship and
good neighborliness between the Bahraini and Qatari peoples.
</P>
<P>
Al-Muttawa further stated that Bahrain would not boycott the
GCC, but was merely boycotting the Doha summit.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that Bahrain's attitude was not taken off-hand,
nor was it a reaction to Qatar's position, but was the outcome of
years of dialogue over the dispute during which Bahrain had been
regularly rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
He added that the International Court's decision to consider
the case at the unilateral Qatari request has contributed to the
escalation of tension rather than easing the situation, pointing
out that the decision had not taken into consideration the
approval of the two parties to go to the Court.
</P>
<P>
The Bahraini Minister underlined that his country adhered to
Saudi Arabian mediation which ought to be given ample time to
reach an amicable solution.
</P>
<P>
He added that Bahrain adamantly insists on affording the GCC
an effective role in resolving the Bahraini-Qatari dispute.
</P>
<P>
The GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar and
the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
Qatar had referred the boder dispute to the International
Court of Justice in 1991, while maintaining Saudi Arabian
mediation and promising to withdraw the case from the Court
should a fraternal settlement be reached.
</P>
<P>
The Bahraini-Qatari border dispute dates back to the 1930s
when Britain handed over the administrative authority over the
Hawar island to Bahrain.

INA quoted an Iraqi military spokesman as saying that the

Last week, the U.S. fired 44 cruise missiles at Iraqi targets
in the south. It also expanded the "no-fly" zone in the region
from the 32nd to the 33rd parallel -- a line that reaches the
southern suburbs of Baghdad. Another "no-fly" zone is above the
36th parallel in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has announced that he would no

intensified their campaign against Front National (FN) leader
Jean-Marie Le Pen for his repeated public declaration that he
believes in the theory of "racial inequality."
</P>
<P>
Henri Emmanuelli, former first secretary of the Socialist
Party, today called for the banning of the FN for its racist
ideologue.
</P>
<P>
He said that the banning of the FN has become "a moral and
legal imperative," because racism "is an offense" and "should be
fought in this way."
</P>
<P>
"Faced with a movement which abuses democracy and won't stop
as long as it is not eliminated, democracy has the duty to launch
an official declaration of war," said Emmanuelli.
</P>
<P>
Dominique Strauss-Khan, a former government minister from the
Socialist Party, said, "Le Pen is a racist, his party is a
neo-fascist party."
</P>
<P>
Harlem Desir, national secretary of the Socialist Party, said
that one has never heard of the declaration made by Le Pen since
the 1940s and the declaration is against the principles of the
Republic.
</P>
<P>
The daily newspaper Humanite today quoted Professor Andre
Langaney of the Museum of Natural History in Paris as saying that
"scientifically speaking, there has no evidence on `racial'
characters which are genetically markable."
</P>
<P>
He said that morally speaking, Le Ben "falls under the blow of
the law" by making the racist declaration and it would be normal
if the government pursues judicial inquiry against him.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre said that the declaration
made by Le Pen is "a wild imagination."

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Hiring Welfare Recipients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton today called on states to ensure that private companies
will employ those eliminated from public assistance rolls, saying
jobs are crucial to making welfare reform succeed.
</P>
<P>
Clinton told a gathering of Southern governors in Kansas City,
Missouri, that he had granted their wish for converting federal
welfare programs to block grants and now they had a responsibility
to use the money to supplement wages paid by private employers.
</P>
<P>
"You asked for this, and now you got it," The Associated Press
quoted Clinton as saying. "There is not enough money around to
create enough public jobs to solve this welfare problem."
</P>
<P>
In Kansas City to launch a three-day campaign trip, Clinton
embraced a program that converts public assistance money into
paying jobs as an example of how states can follow up the welfare
legislation he signed last month.
</P>
<P>
Under the Kansas City program, a public-private partnership
called the Local Investment Commission funnels federal welfare and
food stamp money to an agency that uses the money to give
employers wage supplements of 500 dollars a month for each former
welfare recipient they hire. The new employee continues to receive
health-care and day-care benefits for four years.
</P>
<P>
Missouri is one of 12 states that use public assistance money
to supplement wages.
</P>
<P>
In his speech accepting the Democratic presidential nomination
last month, Clinton said Americans have a moral obligation to
ensure there are jobs available to people who must leave the
welfare rolls under the new law.
</P>
<P>
The welfare legislation replaces the current Aid to Families
with Dependent Children program with block grants to states. It
caps lifetime welfare benefits at five years and ends benefits
after two years for adults who do not go to work.
</P>
<P>
Kansas City was the first stop on Clinton's three-day swing
through Missouri, Colorado, Arizona and California.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, the president plans to offer ideas on improving drug
treatment, especially for prison inmates, and today he will focus
on education, press secretary Mike McCurry said.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Production Capacity Use Up in 2nd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Canadian industries increased
their use of production capacity in the second quarter, the first
time since late 1994.
</P>
<P>
Industries operated at 82.7 percent of capacity, a slight
increase from 82.4 percent from the previous quarter, Statistics
Canada reported today.
</P>
<P>
However, the figure is still some 4 percentage points less from
the peak of 86.8 percent in 1988, the federal fact-gathering
agency added.
</P>
<P>
An industry's capacity use is the ratio of its actual output to
its estimated potential output.
</P>
<P>
The agency said manufacturers were the major contributors to
this upturn of the quarter. This sector increased its use of
capacity to 83.4 percent, after decreases for four consecutive
quarters.

<HEADLINE> Russian Premier: No Need for Transfer of Yeltsin's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin said today that he sees no need to discuss the
transfer of presidential powers in connection with President Boris
Yeltsin's forthcoming heart operation.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Interfax news agency, Chernomyrdin
also stressed that it is unnecessary to invent any mechanisms for
doing so.
</P>
<P>
He told the Itar-Tass news agency that he finds the issue of
transfer of Yeltsin's powers for the period of his planned heart
operation and post-operative rehabilitation "both artificial and
tactless."
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky told a news
briefing earlier today that Yeltsin had ordered the so-called
"power ministries" to coordinate with Chernomyrdin all issues that
require presidential decision during the president's leave.
</P>
<P>
The order also notes that as long as the president is on leave,
the prime minister, if necessary, can hold Defense Council
sessions on urgent military affairs.
</P>
<P>
Since early last week, a number of Russian lawmakers have urged
the president to give his powers to Chernomyrdin during his leave
in accordance with the country's constitution.
</P>
<P>
"I can understand the citizens' anxiety and concern about the
president's health, and the sincere wishes of full recovery which
they are sending to the president," Chernomyrdin said. "I fully
appreciate their noble impulse and sincere concern."
</P>
<P>
"But, regrettably, I cannot help seeing in the talk on this
delicate subject a solid degree of sly fuss, to put it softly," he
added.
</P>
<P>
"As concerns my position on this question, I see it as both
artificial and tactless," Chernomyrdin said. "To me, this means
that the president remains president both during the operation and
in progress of the whole course of treatment."
</P>
<P>
For this reason, he pointed out, "I see no need for either
discussion of the issue of power transfer or exercises in devising
various mechanisms on this account."
</P>
<P>
As concerns his own powers of premier, Chernomyrdin said, "I
have quite enough of them for my work."
</P>
<P>
From the legal point of view, the government has everything to
ensure a stable political situation in the country and the
implementation of the presidential course of reforms, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 10 (Xinhua) -- International Business
Machines(I.B.M.) and a group of big banks announced on Monday that
they had set up a venture that would improve their ability to
offer services through home computers.
</P>
<P>
The venture, known as integrion, is an attempt by both the
banks and I.B.M. to develop standards for transactions and
contract most of the actual processing to I.B.M and other vendors.
It will also help solve the security concerns raised in doing
business over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
"With this new venture, electronic commerce will take its
biggest step forward to date," Louis V. Gerstner, Chairman of
I.B.M., said. " This is a secure network marketplace that is
essential to the growth of electronic business."
</P>
<P>
The service will be first used by Nationsbank and the Banc One
Corporation as part of internet banking products to be introduced
early next year. other major banks involved include Bank of
America, First Chicago NBD, Fleet Financial Group, Keycorp and PNC
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Integrion will mainly provide what is known as "middleware"
software that helps banks handle electronic transactions from a
variety of sources. Customers will perform transactions using a
variety of methods--from the bank's home page on the Internet to
software like "Managing your Money".
</P>
<P>
Hugh L. McColl Jr., Chairman of the Nationsbank, described the
venture as an essential step in maintaining the banks's control of
the financial system.

<HEADLINE> Turkish FM Meets with Iraqi Special Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Deputy Prime Minister
and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller said here today that Turkey's
plan to establish a security belt zone in northern Iraq is only
aimed at protecting the borders and the innocent people.
</P>
<P>
Ciller made the remarks after a one-hour-and-half meeting with
visiting Special Envoy and Adviser of Iraqi Presidency Saddam
Hussein Hamit Yusuf Hammadi this evening.
</P>
<P>
They discussed the issue of setting up of the safety belt zone,
up to 10 kilometers deep into the Iraqi side of the border, to
prevent the infiltrations of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party
(PKK) into the Turkish territory.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish foreign minister said that the Iraqi delegation,
which arrived here earlier today, is "very responsible and
decisive."
</P>
<P>
"Our soldiers sacrifice themselves and our innocent people die
in our border every day. We take initiatives for the protection of
our borders and our people, not for other intention," Ciller said,
adding that the meeting with the Iraqi delegation is "extremely
useful".
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting with Ciller, Turkish and Iraqi
delegations held a two-hour talk on Turkey's plan to set up the
zone in northern Iraq and the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Hammadi told reporters that Iraqi and Turkish sides exchanged
views on the strengthening of the bilateral ties between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Turkish sources said that during the talks, Turkish side
stressed that Turkey always respects the Iraqi territorial
integrity and sovereignty, adding that Turkey's plan to set up
the safety belt zone is "temporary."
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakn is expected to meet
with Hammadi on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> BIS Expanding Membership, Including China, Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss-based Bank for
International Settlements (BIS) announced Monday that it would
admit China, Russia and other seven fast-growing economies from
Asia and Latin America as its full members by next March, local
press reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 32-member institution in Basel, until now a club dominated
by Western industrial nations, said it would grow to 41 by next
March, also admitting India, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea,
Hong Kong, Brazil and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Financial observers here said that by expanding its membership
for the first time in more than 20 years, the BIS is effectively
acknowledging that developing economies, especially those from
Asia and Latin America, should play a much more important role in
global financial system, corresponding to their fast-growing
economic weight.
</P>
<P>
Originally set up in neutral Switzerland in 1930 to process
German reparation payments from World War I, the BIS has evolved
into a clearinghouse and an informal coordinating center for
central banks.
</P>
<P>
It helps to process international payments, to manage currency
reserves and also helps central banks to discuss and cooperate on
such issues as interests rates, banking regulations and
supervision.
</P>
<P>
BIS President Wim Duisenberg said the expansion of the bank
will permit the new members "to participate more fully in the
cooperative activities of the BIS, and to have an influence on the
common views".

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Northern Cyprus leader Rauf
Denktash and Turkish Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister
Tansu Ciller today jointly called for the resumption of
intercommunal talks on Cyprus to defuse the worsening tension on
the Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
Denktash appealed to Greek Cypriot leader Glafcos Clerides,
saying: "We have to talk in order to cool off the heat and
tension," adding, "Let's talk about how we can make Cyprus a
bridge of peace between Turkey and Greece."
</P>
<P>
Ciller was on the island today to attend the funeral of
Allahverdi Kilic, a Turkish Cypriot sentry, who was killed by
Greek Cypriots Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have mounted on the island following the killing by
Turkish Cypriot security forces and civilians in August of two
Greek Cypriot demonstrators. In what appeared to be an act of
revenge for last month's incidents Kilic was killed and another,
Burhan Cihangir, was wounded seriously at a Famagusta sentry
post in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Ciller said that Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot people were
for peace and tranquility on the island and appealed to
U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to bring the leaders
of the two sides together and resume a dialogue between the two
parts of the island.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the Greek Cypriot government will only
consent to a meeting with Denktash once agreement is achieved on
a number of points connected to the Cyprus issue through
proximity talks.
</P>
<P>
More than 30,000 Turkish troops are stationed in northern
Cyprus to protect the Turkish Cypriots in the northern part of
the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey sent troops to
intervene following a coup of Greek Cypriots seeking union with
Greece.
</P>
<P>
Denktash declared a breakaway "Turkish Republic of Northern
Cyprus" in 1983, but it is only recognized by Turkey.

<HEADLINE> South Korea, U.S. Resume Talks On Troops Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 11 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and the United
States resumed talks here today on the revision of a 20-year-old
agreement governing U.S. soldiers stationed in the country.
</P>
<P>
The talks were stalled for six months after the U.S. delayed
responding to a draft revision of the Status of Forces Agreement
(SOFA) put forward by South Korea at the sixth round of talks in
Washington in March.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. side postponed scheduling the seventh round of
discussions several times, saying it needed more time to review
the South Korean draft.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are trying to narrow differences over the extent
to which South Korean law enforcement authorities have
jurisdiction over American soldiers accused of committing crimes
in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The talks will continue on Thursday. "Both sides decided to
extend this round of talks until tomorrow (Thursday) because they
still have much to discuss before reaching an agreement on some
thorny points of contention," a Foreign Ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the official could not confirm whether the talks
will end Thursday or continue for longer, indicating that the two
sides have problems in narrowing their differences.
</P>
<P>
South Korea wants to take American soldiers accused of murder,
rape or other serious crimes into custody before or at least at
the time of their indictment, while the U.S. wants to delay the
transfer of custody until the final court ruling.
</P>
<P>
Seoul also insists that the provision of the current SOFA
agreement banning South Korean authorities from appealing a lower
court ruling to a higher court is favorable to American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The existing SOFA stipulates that any statements made by
accused American servicemen are not valid unless they are made in
the presence of American officers. South Korea wants to nullify
this provision.
</P>
<P>
In November 1995, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher
and South Korean Foreign Minister Gong Ro-myung agreed in Seoul to
set up a special committee to discuss the revision of the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Since its signing in 1966, more than 30,000 crimes have been
committed by U.S. servicemen and some 40 murders have been linked
to the U.S. military presence in the country where 37,000 American
troops are stationed.

<HEADLINE> Germany to Continue Peacekeeping Mission in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 11 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
said today German troops will remain in Bosnia even when the IFOR
forces' mandate for implementing the Bosnia peace accord runs out
in December.
</P>
<P>
During a parliamentary debate on the 1997 budget, Kohl said
German troops would continue to participate in and safeguard the
Bosnian peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said he could not imagine the German peacekeeping troops
would withdraw from the responsibility of maintaining peace in the
war-torn region.
</P>
<P>
Germany has provided some 4,000 personnel to the IFOR
peace-keeping mission, although not all have been stationed in
Bosnia itself.
</P>
<P>
Kohl thanked the German soldiers who joined the international
peacekeeping force (IFOR), saying that they should be respected.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the necessity of repatriating refugees in the
Bosnia war, a process important for rebuilding the country.
</P>
<P>
Germany has taken in more than 400,000 war refugees and spent
15 billion marks (10 billion U.S. dollars) caring for them. Kohl
said the money would be better used in rebuilding the region
devastated by nearly four years of war.
</P>
<P>
Some 50,000 troops from 34 countries under U.S. leadership are
deployed in Bosnia to help implement the Dayton peace accord which
ended the war.
</P>
<P>
The NATO-led IFOR's mandate in Bosnia is expected to run out in
December and the forces are planning to start pulling out of the
region after the Bosnian elections next week. enditem

<HEADLINE> France to Sign CTBT on September 24, Says President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
said today France will sign the treaty banning nuclear testing on
September 24, the first day it can be signed.
</P>
<P>
The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) was approved by the
United Nations General Assembly in New York on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said he was "delighted about the overwhelming majority
of votes" for the treaty which he described as "a great success
for the international community," government spokesman Alain
Lamassoure said.
</P>
<P>
The president said this is the first time since atomic weapons
appeared more than 50 years ago for the international community to
commit itself to a definitive end to nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
"This success will allow us to finally turn the page on the
nuclear arms race. It gives future generations the hope of a
world free from the threat of nuclear proliferation."
</P>
<P>
Chirac said France played a major role in the negotiations on
the CTBT and in the "mobilization of the international community"
to reach the "zero option," a complete ban on all nuclear
explosions.
</P>
<P>
"France will sign the treaty on the first day it opens for
signature, September 24, and appeals to all the states to do the
same and from now to abide by the contents of the treaty," the
government spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette said today
that France will continue to try to persuade India to sign the
treaty.
</P>
<P>
India has refused to accept the treaty because there is no
timetable for global nuclear disarmament.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Government to Curb Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is planning to cut
public spending next year as increases in tax collection fail to
keep pace with government expenditure, the weekly Vietnam
Investment Review magazine said in its latest edition.
</P>
<P>
Although budget revenue is estimated to rise 8.5 percent to
some 6.12 billion U.S. dollars in 1997, government spending is
forecast to increase 8.9 percent in the same period, the
English-language newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
"If we fail to take resolute measures to control spending, we
will meet with fiercer challenges as a heavier budget burden will
be a major difficulty for 1997," an official from the Ministry of
Planning and Investment was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Even so, government estimates forecast the budget deficit will
fall as a percentage of gross domestic product next year to 2.7
percent, compared with an expected 3 percent this year and 4.3
percent in 1995, according to latest statistics.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet, standing Vice Prime Minister Phan
Van Khai and other senior officials met in Ho Chi Minh city last
week to review the annual economic plan.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, some 70 percent of government revenue, which
comes mainly from taxes, will be used on revenue expenditure on
items such as public salaries and only 30 percent will be used for
capital spending on development and repaying foreign debts, said
the magazine.
</P>
<P>
However, no more than 4 percent of Vietnam's GDP will be used
to pay off the national debt under the plan.
</P>
<P>
Income from taxes and fees will total 5.87 billion dollars in
1997, up 10.4 percent on this year and equal to about 19 percent
of the country's GDP.
</P>
<P>
But that's lower than the 20-21 percent figure approved by the
ruling Vietnamese Communist party in its socio-economic strategic
development plan at its national congress in June.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia, Vietnam Enter Tiger Cup Semis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 11 (Xinhua) -- A shot from Kurniawan Dwi
Yulianto Wednesday helped Indonesia to become one the top four at
the Tiger Cup football tournament and toped the Group A despite a
1-1 draw with Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The result put Indonesia to fight against Malaysia in a
semifinal tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Kurniawan's 44th minute rocket, after some superb work by
teammate Bodiman, opened the scoring in the deciding Group A game.
</P>
<P>
However, the Indonesians were denied a 100 per cent record in
the qualifying round when Vo Hoang Boo scored from the penalty
spot in the 77th minute after Dang Phuong Nam was brought down.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam also qualify for the semi-finals, ahead of Laos and
Burma, who played later in the evening. Burma won 4-2 thanks to
two goals from Khenkitisack Bounlap.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam proved their silver medal in the South East Asian Games
last year was no fluke as they held the upper hand at the start
of the game. Striker Le Huynh Duc allowed a gilt-edged chance to
slip by the post in the 10th minute.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's Eri Iriyanto then hit the cross-bar with a fierce
30 yard drive 11 minutes before Kurniawan pummelled the ball into
the back of the net.
</P>
<P>
Iriyanto shook the woodwork again in the second half with a 20
yard free-kick while Kurniawan missed a great opportunity minutes
later.
</P>
<P>
But the Indonesians suffered a major set back for the knock-out
phase when top scorer Peri Sandria, who has struck four times in
the tournament, was carried off with an injured ankle.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam will play Thailand in Friday's semi-finals after the
Thais topped Group B with a victory over hosts Singapore on
Tuesday night.

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Perry and top military officer General John Shalikashvilli
will be in Sarajevo today to discuss with senior officers of the
NATO peace implementation troops there security measures for the
Bosnian national elections Saturday, Pentagon officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has repeatedly expressed the hope
that the elections, designed to reunite the ethnically divided
former Yugoslav republic, will be held smoothly so that the 16,000
American peace implementation troops could be pulled out of the
war-torn country at the end of this year as President Bill Clinton
promised the U.S. Congress last year.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. European allies have said that the U.S.-led NATO
forces should remain in Bosnia for at least two years to prevent
the possible resumption of the war there.
</P>
<P>
Senior NATO officials, convinced that Bosnia will remain carved
into ethnic enclaves for the foreseeable future, are reportedly
drafting plans to prolong the NATO presence there.
</P>
<P>
Some Western diplomats warn that the peace could be imperiled if
the Clinton administration does not keep a few thousand American
ground soldiers in the Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
British and French officials say that their troops will not
stay if American ground forces are pulled out, even if the United
States provides air support.

<HEADLINE> Urgent: Iraq Fires Missiles at US Fighters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Two F-16 fighters of the
U.S. Air Force assigned to Operation Provide Comfort and flying
over northern Iraq were fired on by Iraqi ground-to-air missiles
this morning, a spokeswoman of the U.S. Embassy here told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman Margarete Schmidt said that the (Iraqi) missiles
missed the two U.S. aircraft, adding that "the missiles were
launched from an unknown position within Iraq, and the U.S.
fighters did not return fire."
</P>
<P>
High-ranking sources of the Turkish Foreign Ministry confirmed
that the Iraqi troops had fired two missiles at two U.S. F-16
jets patrolling over northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A U.S.-led allied air force, based in Incirlik, Adana of
southern Turkey, has been patrolling over northern Iraq since the
Gulf war in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The air force, made up of U.S., British and French warplanes
and support aircraft, daily patrols the northern "no-fly" zone set
up north of the 36th parallel after the Gulf was to deter the
Iraqi attacks on Kurds in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The force's strength and composition vary according to the
demands of the situation although Turkey wants to limit the
number of the combat planes to 48.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. planes dominate the force with 18 F-15 and six F-16
fighters and four F-111 fighter-bombers.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the U.S. fired 44 missiles at Iraqi air defense
targets in southern Iraq. It also expanded the southern "no-fly"
zone from the 32nd parallel to 33rd parallel, reaching the
southern suburbs of the Iraqi capital of Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has announced that he would no
longer recognize the "no-fly" zones and ordered his forces to shoot
at any U.S. and allied aircraft that violate the Iraqi airspace.

<HEADLINE> 10th AFTA Meeting Ends in Jakarta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The 10th meeting of the ASEAN
Free Trade Area (AFTA) Council ended here this evening, calling on
the member countries to accelerate the process of creating AFTA by
2003.
</P>
<P>
A joint press statement issued at the meeting said the council
has reviewed progress in the implementation of the Common
Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT) scheme of AFTA since the 9th
AFTA Council meeting held in April 1996 in Sentosa, Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The statement said intra-ASEAN exports of CEPT products grew at
18.68 percent from 47.4 billion US dollars in 1994 to 56.3 billion
US dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Intra-ASEAN exports of CEPT and non-CEPT products increased by
19.76 percent from 57.4 billion US dollars in 1994 to 68.8 billion
US dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The share of CEPT products in intra-ASEAN exports remained
significant at 81.76 percent in 1995, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The meeting emphasized that besides tariff reductions and the
elimination of non-tariff measures, trade facilitation programs
were also important to support the AFTA process.
</P>
<P>
The council noted that an ASEAN common customs form has been
finalized and will be targeted to be implemented in November this
year.
</P>
<P>
Substantial progress has been made in other areas of customs
cooperation, such as the harmonization of tariff nomenclature,
customs valuation and customs procedures, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
In order to simplify tariff reductions under AFTA, the council
mandated that one legal enactment for these reductions be prepared
to cover the entire period up to the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting was attended by all the seven members of the
ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) -- Brunei,
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The 28th ASEAN Economic Ministers Meeting will be held here
Thursday and followed Friday by dialogues between ASEAN members
and its partners -- Australia, New Zealand and Japan.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador to Japan Xu
Dunxin made serious representations to Japan today against the
activities of Japanese right-wing groups on China's Diaoyu Islands
in the East China Sea.
</P>
<P>
Groups of Japanese have landed on the islands over the last two
months and put up a lighthouse and other war memorial structures.
</P>
<P>
Xu told Sadayuki Hayashi, Permanent Vice-Minister in the
Japanese Foreign Ministry that the chain of Diaoyu Islands have
been part of China's territory since ancient times and that it was
illegl for Japanese to build any structures on the islands.
</P>
<P>
He said Japan and China had already reached an understanding on
the Diaoyu Islands issue, agreeing to put it aside temporarily to
be resolved in the future.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, with the connivance of the Japanese
authorities, some Japanese right-wing groups had landed the Diaoyu
Islands several times since July and built a lighthouse and war
memorial structures on them despite China's repeated strong
protests.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that the Chinese government raised fierce protests
against the activities of the Japanese right-wing groups which
have violated China's territorial sovereignty and aroused the
indignation of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
He said Japan's one-sided action would neither change China's
sovereignty rights over the Diaoyu Islands nor alter the fact that
the islands are part of Chinese territory.

<HEADLINE> Ambassador: Jordan Disappointed about Peace Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian ambassador in
Israel expressed his country's disappointment about the delay in
implementing the peace treaty signed by Jordan and Israel in
October 1994 as the second anniversary of the signing of the peace
treaty approaches.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Jerusalem Report, an English bi-weekly
magazine, Jordanian Ambassador in Israel Omar Rifai said that
"there has been no translation of the hopes into hard economic
facts on the ground -- or certainly not at the pace we wanted."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the delays in the implementation of the peace
agreement between Jordan and Israel in the fields of trade and
water and other joint projects such as a new airport to serve
Aqaba and Eilat, the ambassador blamed the Israeli bureaucracy for
the slow progress.
</P>
<P>
However, Rifai described the Israeli-Jordanian relationship as
"strategic and permanent," and strong enough to "withstand ups
and downs on other tracks of the peace process."
</P>
<P>
Jordan is watching Israeli-Palestinian developments, he noted,
adding that Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti met
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in the West Bank town of Ramallah
in late August.
</P>
<P>
Rifai pledged that if Israeli-Palestinian ties reach the point
of collapse, Jordan will step in as "an honest partner" to try
to revive them.
</P>
<P>
But, he said that "we don't want our role boosted in final
status negotiations," stressing the future of the West Bank, Gaza
Strip and east Jerusalem must be settled by Israel and the
Palestinians themselves.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Inspects Xinjiang, Qinghai and Ningxia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The leading officials and
people in China's western region should work hard to build the
area into a happy home for people of all ethnic groups, Premier Li
Peng has urged.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking during an inspection tour of northwest China's
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Qinghai province and Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The Party Central Committee and the State Council, China's
highest governing body, have paid close attention to development
in the western region, and worked out a series of measures to
support its development, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the development of resources is an important
measure to accelerate the region's improvement, and one of the
central government's major measures is to accelerate economic
development in the region by tapping its resources, and embarking
on basic construction projects.
</P>
<P>
The imbalance between the eastern and western regions is caused
by historical reasons, and it will take time to narrow the gap, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The western region is a major habitat for ethnic groups, and
the unity between various ethnic groups must always be placed in
an important position, he said.
</P>
<P>
The economic development is the foundation for the promotion of
national unity, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Party's religious policy is to respect and protect the
freedom of religious beliefs, he said, pointing out that religious
activities must be conducted by the book, and departments
concerned must improve the management of religious affairs.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that religion should meet the requirements of
society and social development, and Party committees and
governments at all levels must guide religions to fit into a
socialist society.
</P>
<P>
As for poverty-relief work, the premier pointed out that the
central government has attached great importance to this task.
</P>
<P>
Although Party committees and governments at all levels have
made great efforts in this respect, they should take more steps to
speed up poverty relief, he said.

<HEADLINE> Local, Foreign Residents Flee from Jalalabad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PESHAWAR, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of Afghan
people and most of the foreign missions in Jalalabad, Afghanistan
were rushing to quit the city today due to tense fighting there.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said that thousands of Afghan government
troops who were air-dropped into Jalalabad, the capital of
Nangarhar province of Afghanistan, were fighting with the local
forces which had defected to the Taliban Militia.
</P>
<P>
Jalalabad, the biggest city in eastern Afghanistan, is very
close to the border of Pakistan, so a large number of people who
fled Jalalabad were heading towards Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Pakistan's Consulate General in Jalalabad,
Nisar Ali Khan, had already crossed the border into Pakistan and
so had some UN officials.
</P>
<P>
The UN Peace Mission to Afghanistan had just shifted its
headquarters from Islamabad to Jalalabad at the end of July, which
has been considered as a peace-heaven in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
So far, there is no information as to if all the officials from
the Mission have retreated into Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to check the influx of the Afghan refugees, the
Pakistani government tightened the security along the border with
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
However, the Torkham gate at the border reopened this afternoon
as thousands of war-frightened Afghan people flooded to the border
gate, crying and shouting.

<HEADLINE> Urgent: Iraq Fires Missiles at US Fighters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Two F-16 fighters of the
U.S. Air Force assigned to Operation Provide Comfort and flying
over northern Iraq were fired on by Iraqi ground-to-air missiles
this morning, a spokeswoman of the U.S. Embassy here told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman Margarete Schmidt said that the (Iraqi) missiles
missed the two U.S. aircraft, adding that "the missiles were
launched from an unknown position within Iraq, and the U.S.
fighters did not return fire."
</P>
<P>
High-ranking sources of the Turkish Foreign Ministry confirmed
that the Iraqi troops had fired two missiles at two U.S. F-16
jets patrolling over northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A U.S.-led allied air force, based in Incirlik, Adana of
southern Turkey, has been patrolling over northern Iraq since the
Gulf war in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The air force, made up of U.S., British and French warplanes
and support aircraft, daily patrols the no-fly zone set up north
of the 36th parallel after the Gulf was to deter the Iraqi attacks
on Kurds in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The force's strength and composition vary according to the
demands of the situation although Turkey wants to limit the
number of the combat planes to 48.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. planes dominate the force with 18 F-15 and six F-16
fighters and four F-111 fighter-bombers.

<HEADLINE> Limited Printing of Wu Guanzhong's Oil Painting Issued in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The painting "Night Coffee",
by China's top oil painter Wu Guanzhong, today became the first
Chinese contemporary oil painting work in print as a limited
edition.
</P>
<P>
 A total of 78 copies have been produced, and were issued in
Shanghai today.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Wenhui Culture and Art Company, which is in charge
of the print, had earlier printed limit numbers of works by Liu
Haisu and Zhu Qizhan, masters of Chinese paintings.
</P>
<P>
Wu Guanzhong, 78-year-old honorary Chairman of China Oil
Painting Society, travelled from Beijing to attend the first issue
of his printed work.
</P>
<P>
"Night Coffee" was painted by Wu when he toured Paris in
1978. His work was printed with a special emulation technique, and
each piece of his printed work has his signature and is set in a
high-grade imported picture frame.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Municipal Notary Office issued notarial certificates
for all of the 78 copies.
</P>
<P>
Limited-edition printing of masters' paintings is an
internationally recognized way of collecting artistic works.
</P>
<P>
It first became popular in Europe and America. Large Art
Galleries and museums in the west often collect printed works of
world famous masters, such as Piccaso and Milo.
</P>
<P>
In 1994 and 1995, the Shanghai Wenhui Culture and Art Company
printed 100 copies of a Chinese painting work by Liu Haisu and 105
copies of a work by Zhu Qizhan.
</P>
<P>
The buyers of the two masters' limited edition works came from
inland areas, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, Canada, the United States
and Singapore.

<HEADLINE> Amal-Hezbollah Coalition to Win Elections in Beqaa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's two major Shiite
groups, the Amal movement and Hezbollah, will achieve another
landslide victory in the last round of the parliamentary elections
in eastern Lebanon next Sunday, political observers expected
today.
</P>
<P>
The observers anticipated that the electional coalition formed
by the Amal movement headed by House Speaker Nabih Berri and the
Islamic fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party of God, is to replay a
success it made in the elections in southern Lebanon Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Some 150 candidates are to compete in the next Sunday's
elections in the Beqaa valley, the last of the five-phased general
 elections in Lebanon, for 23 parliamentary seats allocated for
the constituency.
</P>
<P>
At stake in the elections are eight seats reserved for Shiite
Moslems, five for Sunni Moslems, three for Greek Catholic
Christians, three for Maronites, two for Greek Orthodox
Christians, one for Druzes and one for Armenian Orthodox
Christians.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the Amal movement said that a joint list of
candidates negotiated by the pro-Syrian group and the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah will be announced Thursday in Chtaura, a Christian-
predominant town in the Beqaa valley.
</P>
<P>
Berri and Hezbollah only reached the agreement on coalition
for the elections in southern Lebanon and the Beqaa valley after
Damascus intensified its mediation efforts last week.
</P>
<P>
The sources disclosed that the Amal-Hezbollah joint list for
the Beqaa elections includes three Hezbollah candidates, Emar
al-Mussawi, Ibrahim Bayan and Rabiat Kiruz, with the first a
Hezbollah member and both the second and third allies of the
party.
</P>
<P>
The remaining among the 23 candidates on the list are members
of the Amal and its friends, including six ministers in the
government of Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri, as well as incumbent
Deputy House Speaker Elie al-Frizli.
</P>
<P>
The six ministers are Mohsen Dalloul, minister of defense,
Mahmoud Abu Hamdan, minister of housing and cooperatives, Abdu
al-Rahim Mrad, minister of professional and technical education,
Nicolas Fattouch, minister of tourism, Shawki Fakhoury, minister
of agriculture and Rober Ghanem, minister of national education.
</P>
<P>
Hussein al-Husseini, former Shiite house speaker, will probably
head the coalition.
</P>
<P>
In the elections in southern Lebanon Sunday, the Amal and
Hezbollah forged an incomplete joint list of 21 candidates, while
leaving two Sunni slots vacant after Hezbollah objected Berri's
proposal to include Bahia Hariri, sister of Prime Minister Hariri
in the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah leaders insisted that they would never stand the
general elections "side by side with a Hariri."
</P>
<P>
According to the official announcement of the results, the 23
parliamentary seats allocated for southern Lebanon were won by the
21 candidates in the Amal-Hezbollah coalition, as well as Bahia
and Mustafa Saad, a Hezbollah-backed candidate.
</P>
<P>
Among the winners in southern Lebanon's elections is Berri,
who stressed today that what had happened in the south will
replay in the Beqaa valley with "the same atmosphere, the same
honesty and the same density."
</P>
<P>
Receiving congratulators in his residence, the house speaker
said that he had expected a "big victory" of the Amal-Hezbollah
coalition in the south before the elections in the constituency
started.
</P>
<P>
He repeated a previous announcement on his candidacy for the
speakership in the new parliament, noting that the announcement
was not a "trial balloon."

<HEADLINE>   Vietnam Making New Efforts to Join WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is attempting to boost
its bid to join the World Trade Organization by submitting further
details of its trading laws and conditions, the Vietnamese
Ministry of Trade said today.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam presented its first memorandum when it officially
applied to join the 128-member world trade body in August 1995.
</P>
<P>
But the WTO required a more detailed and in-depth report
because it was not satisfied with Vietnam's explanation of its
legal framework on services, intellectual property, licensing,
banking and financial systems, Nguyen Van Binh, an official from
the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
A WTO delegation is expected to visit Hanoi after the new
memorandum has been studied thoroughly. If the document is
accepted, negotiations between Vietnam and the trade organization
will begin.
</P>
<P>
Binh expects the negotiations especially with the United States
will be difficult because the U.S. is not yet ready to grant
Vietnam Most Favored Nation preferential trading status.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Gov't Air-Drops Troops into Jalalabad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PESHAWAR, September 11 (Xinhua) -- In a surprising move,
thousands of Afghan government troops were air-dropped into
Jalalabad, the biggest city in eastern Afghanistan this morning,
to fight for control of the city.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said that at least 70 people were killed
during street fighting between the government troops and local
forces who defected to the Taliban Militia Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that the massive penetration of troops by Kabul
into Jalalabad, the capital of Nargarhar province, forced the
Taliban to retreat instead of marching towards the provincial
capital.
</P>
<P>
The Kabul government claimed today that their troops had
controlled Jalalabad, while the Taliban said that the Jalalabad
airport was still in its hand and fighting was going on in and
around the city.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban captured the strategic town of Hisarak in Nangarhar
Tuesday morning, routing the troops loyal to Nangarhar Governor
Abdul Qadeer who recently shifted his neutral position and joined
forces with the Kabul regime against the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
After the fall of Hisarak and some colleagues' defection to the
Taliban, Qadeer fled into Pakistan with some key members of his
ruling council last night, leaving Jalalabad leaderless.
</P>
<P>
Then the Taliban designated the defected commander of Qadeer as
the new Governor of Nangarhar.
</P>
<P>
However, with the help of Hazrat Ali, a member of Nangarhar
ruling council who had already joined hands with the Kabul regime,
the Afghan government launched the surprising operation of
airlifting thousands of its troops to Jalalabad.

<P>
LONDON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Jordan-Peugeot have dismissed
reports that Britain's Damon Hill could be racing alongside
Formula One rival Michael Schumacher's younger brother Ralf next
season.
</P>
<P>
According to AFP report, Ralf Schumacher, who currently heads
the Formula 3,000 standings, is to be signing for Jordan before
the Portuguese Grand Prix on September 22.
</P>
<P>
But Jordan denied the 21-year-old Schumacher had been recruited
for 1997 and said negotiations with several drivers were
continuing.
</P>
<P>
If Schumacher does link up with Jordan, he could be partnered
by his brother's arch-rival.
</P>
<P>
Jordan team boss Eddie Jordan admitted last week he was
interested in signing Hill, who has also been linked with
Benetton, McLaren and the new Stewart Grand Prix team since it
was announced that Heinz-Harald Frentzen would partner Jacques
Villeneuve for Williams next year.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Mayor of Amsterdam Interviewed in Xi'an </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Public transportation should be
given priority, while private cars should be controlled to protect
cultural heritages of historic cities, Ernst C. Bakker, vice-mayor
of Amsterdam in the Netherlands, said in China today.
</P>
<P>
Bakker was speaking in Xi'an, capital of northwest China's
Shaanxi Province at the on-going World Conference of Historical
Cities.
</P>
<P>
While admitting he was enchanted by the city walls and other
relics of the ancient capital, he was worried by the heavy traffic
and noise pollution in Xi'an.
</P>
<P>
We hold the view that historical cities should stress the
development of public transportation and underground
transportation, reduce the number of private cars on the streets,
and encourage people to use public transport and bicycles, he said.
</P>
<P>
The history of Amsterdam dates back to the Middle Ages, when
busy international trade created the need for a canal network. At
the end of 19th century, many century-old houses had to give way
to expanding city transportation, and many canals were filled
in. Later railway construction opened a new page of prosperity in
the history of the city, which lasted into the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
Today, Amsterdam's municipal government encourages people to go
to work by bus to ease the traffic pressure, he said, adding that
the government has also invested heavily in subway development,
which won widespread support from the citizens.
</P>
<P>
"We might build a city-wide public transportation system on the
one hand, and, meanwhile, strengthen the protection of cultural
heritages on the other," Bakker said.

<HEADLINE> Germany Cautiously Welcomes Nuclear Test Ban Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Germany has cautiously welcomed
the nuclear test ban treaty passed by the U.N. General Assembly
Tuesday, and called on all countries to sign and ratify it as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, who described the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) as a "historic breakthrough," said he will
sign it later this month when he goes to New York to attend the
General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel was pleased that two and a half years of hard, sometimes
dramatic, negotiations had finally yielded a result. But he also
expressed concern over the treaty.
</P>
<P>
Although "an important impediment" on the road to an ultimate
comprehensive ban on nuclear testing had been overcome, the final
goal had still not been reached, he said.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, which is expected to open for signature later this
month, can only come into force 180 days after all 44 countries
with nuclear capability have signed it.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. General Assembly today voted 158 to three with five
abstentions to approve the treaty to ban all kinds of nuclear
testing.

<HEADLINE> Almost Half Captivity-bred Pandas Born in Artificial Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Almost half of China's 100
captivity-bred giant pandas were born in an artificial environment.
</P>
<P>
There are now about 1,000 wild giant pandas in China, spreading
over an area of 13,000 square kilometers in Sichuan, Shaanxi and
Gansu provinces.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen Renjie, vice-secretary general of the
Wildlife Protection Association of China, the State Council
approved a project for the protection of the panda's habitat in
1992.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, 14 existing nature reserves for pandas will
be perfected and another 14 nature reserves will be set up. To
connect the habitats of the giant pandas, 17 corridors will be
built, and 32 giant panda protection management stations will be
set up.
</P>
<P>
On completion of the project, 95 percent of the wild pandas in
China will be under strict protection. At present, general
programming for 19 nature reserves have been completed and
investment has been put in the basic construction of 13 nature
reserves.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Research Center for the Protection of Giant Pandas,
in Wolong National Nature Reserve in southwest China's Sichuan
Province, has bred 12 pandas between 1991 and 1995, and has the
largest group of pandas in captivity in China. enditem

<HEADLINE> China Finds out Cause of Rocket Launch Failure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Rogue information sent by a
computer doomed the maiden flight of China's Long March 3B rocket
carrier on February 15.
</P>
<P>
The fateful hiccup was caused by the changes of inertial
reference in the rocket's control system.
</P>
<P>
The changes produced wrong information which was sent to the
computer-driven control system, which ordered the spacecraft to
change course, with disastrous results.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the China Great Wall Industrial Corporation
said that the conclusion was made after extensive tests and a
detailed analysis of the launch.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the most possible reason that caused the
changes was no power output for the platform's mobile cycle
stable recirculating loop.
</P>
<P>
He said that the rocket violently exploded after falling to the
ground and the satellite it was carrying, and the rocket itself,
were completely wrecked. It meant that the analysis of the
accident mainly depended on remote sensing data and a high-speed
photographic record of the rocket's take off.
</P>
<P>
Based on the analysis, extensive ground tests - including
half-material object emulation tests - and closed cycle tests of
the recirculating loop, the accident phenomenon was repeated.
</P>
<P>
As the power level in the mobile cycle stable recirculating
loop was zero, the operation of the inner cycle became abnormal
and caused the changes of inertial reference, and sent wrong
information to the rocket carrier's control system. This
information ordered the rocket to head rightward of the scheduled
launch direction, and finally crashed against a hill 1.85
kilometers away from the launch site.
</P>
<P>
The rocket carrier and the satellite were totally destroyed in
the explosion.
</P>
<P>
The tests also showed that except for the inertial platform,
all other computer hardware and software on the rocket operated
normally for the first 22 seconds of the rocket's flight.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the improvement of the rocket system is
underway, and his company will report the investigation results
and the improvement measures to its customers and the insurance
companies concerned.

<HEADLINE> Tarim Basin Becomes China's Third Largest Natural Gas Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Reserves of natural gas in the

BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The largest international
trade fair for garments and textiles ever held in inland areas of
China is scheduled for December 6-10 in Kunming, capital of Yunnan
Province.
</P>
<P>
The five-day gathering for hundreds of clothing businesses from
Hong Kong, Taiwan, southeast Asian nations and other parts of the
country is jointly sponsored by the China Garment Association, the
China National Garment Corporation, a watchdog of the country's
clothing industry, and the Kunming International Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
On display will be garments and accessories, silk, knitwear,
shoes, leather suitcases, and sewing machines.

stretches from the coastal provinces to China's central and western
areas.

<HEADLINE> Shanxi's First Kaolin Production Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The first calcined kaolin
production line in north China's Shanxi Province went into
operation recently.
</P>
<P>
The line produces 10,000 tons of kaolin each year. It was built
by the Sino-American Shanxi Xidi Fine Chemical Industry Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi, China's energy and heavy-chemical industry base,
produces a large amount of gangue in its mining every day, which
has no sensible use and causes various types of pollution.
</P>
<P>
Huang Xicun, a rural entrepreneur in Shanxi's Daixian County,
has done research on using the tailings to produce kaolin for ten
years. Finally, the decade of work paid off, when scientists whom
Huang called on from the Shanxi Coal Chemical Research Institute
and Taiyuan Industry University successfully turned the gangue
into kaolin, super-fine kaolin, molecular sieve and other
processed products.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Wants More Defense Tech Transfer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia wants British
defense industries to invest more in and transfer more defense
technology to Malaysia to strengthen existing military ties
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Defense Minister Syed Hamid Albar, who had talks with
visiting British Defense Secretary Michael Portillo today, said
that although technology transfer in defense related fields was
good, Malaysia felt that Britain as a major arms supplier to the
country could do more.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia not only wants to purchase arms from Britain but also
likes to see the British defense industries set up manufacturing
firms here, thus enabling Malaysia to export defense products to
other countries, he was quoted by Malaysia's official news agency
Bernama as saying.
</P>
<P>
About 50 percent of the defense financial allocation in the
Sixth Malaysia Plan (1991-1995) was spent in Britain for arms
procurement and defense systems, Syed Hamid said.
</P>
<P>
On the Five-Power Defense Arrangement (FPDA) which comprises
Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand and Britain, Syed
Hamid said both countries agreed on the need for a review in view
of the changing political scenario in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
"We agreed that the FPDA is still essential and must be
continued but all the time it must reflect the practical needs of
this region'" he said.
</P>
<P>
The British defense secretary who arrived here earlier today on
a four-day visit also called on Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad here today.
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to visit the Royal Malaysian Air Force Base and
the integrated air defense system headquarters during the visit,
his first to Malaysia since assuming the post in July 1995, which
is to reciprocate that made by Syed Hamid to Britain in June this
year.

<HEADLINE> China Injects More Capital into Housing Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has
loaned the on-going "comfortable housing project" an additional
three billion yuan, in a bid to stimulate the housing construction
drive in the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior official with the Ministry of
Construction, housing development and purchasing have become a
major contributing factor to the overall booming national economic
growth, and the government is taking a series of preferential
policies to ensure its smooth growth.
</P>
<P>
The official said that China will earmark additional funds for
the construction of economical residences which are affordable to
the ordinary residents.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that in the construction of residential homes,
production costs should be covered and only small profits should
be made.
</P>
<P>
He promised that the home-buyers will be gradually freed from
the burden of sharing construction costs of infrastructural
facilities, such as electricity, water and gas supplies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country will accelerate housing reform and give
top priority to changing the current view that housing
distribution is part of a social welfare system. Moreover, steps
will be taken to raise housing rents and set up a reasonable
proportion between rents and selling prices, the official added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the relevant departments will continue to cut
prices to stimulate the housing property sales.

SHENYANG, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The living quarters of
imperial concubines in the Palace Museum in Shenyang, capital city
of northeast China's Liaoning Province, have been renovated and
opened to the public.
</P>
<P>
Four concubines of Huangtaiji, the first emperor of the Qing

Zhi Yunting, curator of the museum, said that the large palaces
stand on four-meter high stone platforms, higher than the official

The quarters were built in a building style typical of the
Manzu Ethnic Group, and different from the Han-style buildings in
the Forbidden City in Beijing, he said.

The quarters were used to host exhibitions of imperial relics
before the renovation.

<P>
HONG KONG, September 11 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of
Hong Kong's professionals are returning to the territory after
emigrating, according to a survey conducted by the Hong Kong
Institute of Human Resources Management.
</P>
<P>
The survey which involved 310 companies in Hong Kong shows the
emigration rate in the workforce last year dropped by 25 percent
compared with 1994, with an average of 60 emigrants returning to
Hong Kong out of every 100 that left.
</P>
<P>
Sara Tang, vice-president of the institute, said that an exodus
of emigrants is expected to return to Hong Kong from overseas in
the final few months before Hong Kong's handover.
</P>
<P>
She said that there has been an increase in the number of
returnees, with most of them citing 1997 as the reason for their
return.
</P>
<P>
She said that in the next few years, more emigrants will return
to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
She urged local companies to formulate long-term plans for
retaining the returned professionals.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Pak, US to Encourage Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 11 (Xinhua) -- As the U.S. official aid to
Pakistan remains suspended, the overall economic and trade
cooperation between Pakistan and the United States are to be
carried out mainly through the private sector on both sides.
</P>
<P>
This is a noticeable indication given out by U.S. Assistant
Secretary for Commerce Raymond Vickery, who concluded his
three-day visit to Pakistan Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Vickery, who was here from September 8-10, met a number of
government officials and business leaders exploring further the
scope of broadening economic and trade partnership.
</P>
<P>
As the United States still suspends its official aid to
Pakistan on the allegation of Pakistan's development of nuclear
weapons, Vickery has stressed upon the need of continued economic
liberalization and privatization.
</P>
<P>
As a major initiative taken during Vickery's stay here to
develop the bilateral economic and trade relationship, Pakistan
and the United States have decided to set up a business
development forum to enhance commercial relations.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S.-Pakistan Business Development Forum will provide an
opportunity to the U.S. and Pakistan businessmen to work together
for promoting commercial activities and resolving issues in
commercial relationship," Vickery said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The forum, to be headed by the chairman of Pakistan's Board of
Investment and the U.S. commerce secretary, is expected to go into
action immediately and to finalize various plans for enhancing
commercial relationship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Vickery said that the decision to set up the Business
Development Forum is reflective of the importance both Pakistan
and the United States attach to strong public-private partnerships
for producing business and commercial results to benefit all
segments of the society.
</P>
<P>
The United States is the largest export market for Pakistani
goods. While Pakistan wishes the export to the U.S. will go up to
10 billion US dollars, it is only reasonable to expect that the
newly created institutional arrangement will be used to increase
their volume to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Pakistani officials, Vickery also
discussed the role of small-and-medium-sized enterprises in
commercial relationship between the two countries. He said the
strong public-private partnerships are vital for producing
business and commercial opportunities between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Vickery said that the U.S. government paid particular attention
to and encouraged initiatives that Pakistan has undertaken in
using private sector techniques to facilitate infrastructure
development in such sectors as electrical power generation,
telecommunications and transportation facilities.
</P>
<P>
He said that small enterprises were the basic engine of
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official also said that environmental technologies are
important to the growth of industry. The U.S. and Pakistan have a
mutual self-interest in using environmental technologies to
increase efficiency and protect the environment.

<HEADLINE> India Not to Make Nuclear Weapons: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Deve
Gowda has said that India would neither build nuclear weapons nor
conduct any further nuclear test.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Japanese Economic Daily here
Tuesday, Gowda said that India's nuclear program would only be
confined to power generation.
</P>
<P>
India exploded its first nuclear weapon in 1974. Many members
of parliament have strongly urged the government to keep its
nuclear option open in the national security interest.
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the United Nations General Assembly vote on the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), India would not sign it in
its present form as it was highly discriminatory, Gowda said.
</P>
<P>
Indian External Affairs Minister I.K. Gujral said today at the
Upper House of Parliament that India would not be cowed down by
any pressure, economic or political, from any quarter in the wake
of its firm vote against the CTBT Resolution in the UN General
Assembly.

<HEADLINE> Reopening of Border Passes Connecting Thailand and </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Dissident Khmer Rouge has
called on the Phnom Penh government to negotiate with Thailand for
the opening of two border passes to facilitate legal trade between
people in its controlled areas and Thai merchants.
</P>
<P>
The request was made by Dissident Khmer Rouge leader Ieng Sary
during his talks with Cambodian co-defense ministers Teah Banh and
Teah Chamrath at the dissident faction's stronghold of Phnom
Malai. The faction agreed to surrender itself to the government on
conditions including the permission for it to stay in its existing
controlled areas.
</P>
<P>
Sources were quoted today by the Thai news agency as saying
that Ieng Sary had requested Phnom Penh to ask the Thai government
to reopen border passes at Ban Nong Beu and Ban Pak-Kad opposite
the Khmer Rouge's town of Phnom Malai and Pailin respectively.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the reopening of the two border passes would
help improve living conditions in the Khmer Rouge areas.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, which recognizes the Phnom Penh government, has
closed all border passes accessible to Khmer Rouge areas after the
faction boycotted the general election in 1993. Thai merchants
used to import timbers and gems which are abundant in Khmer Rouge
areas.

<HEADLINE> China Welcomes Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- China welcomes the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) that has been passed by the
United Nations (UN) General Assembly, Foreign Ministry Spokesman
Shen Guofang told Xinhua here today.
</P>
<P>
This is the first treaty, in the form of international legal
document, aimed to completely prohibit any nuclear weapon test
explosion under any circumstances and in any place on the global
scale.
</P>
<P>
This move will surely contribute to the advancement of the
nuclear disarmament process, the prevention of nuclear weapons
proliferation and promotion of international peace and security,
Shen said.
</P>
<P>
"This undoubtedly conforms to the common interests of the
entire international community," he added.
</P>
<P>
Shen expressed China's hope that the treaty would be signed as
soon as possible and would be "acceded to and honored worldwide."
</P>
<P>
Of course, the prohibition of nuclear test is in itself not the
ultimate objective, but rather the first step toward the
accomplishment of the final goal of the complete elimination of
nuclear weapons, he noted, adding that there is still an nuclear
arsenals of enormous magnitude in the world today, which still
poses a nuclear threat to mankind.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, in the field of nuclear disarmament, the
international community still has an arduous task and a long way
to go, and it should continue to make unremitting efforts to bring
about a world free of nuclear weapons at an earlier date, the
spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Australia For Peaceful Settlement Of Bougainville </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Australian Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer said today that the recent loss of life on the
war-battered Bougainville Island of Papua New Guinea (PNG) was
deeply regrettable and called for a peaceful settlement of the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Downer made the remarks today after local authorities in PNG
reported that about 25 PNG soldiers were killed by the rebel
Bougainville Revolutionary Army (BRA) in an ambush at Kangu Beach
on the island's southern tip Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place before the annual Australia-PNG
ministerial forum scheduled for Thursday in Adelaide, Australia.
</P>
<P>
"It is clearly a tragic incident, and it underlines the need
for there to be a peaceful settlement on Bougainville," Downer
told local reporters today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued today, Downer said that he deeply
regretted the loss of life from the recent attack by the BRA on
the PNG Defense Force.
</P>
<P>
"The Australian government condemns the BRA attack," he said in
the statement.
</P>
<P>
"This sad development underlines the need for a peaceful
resolution of the Bougainville conflict," he said.
</P>
<P>
The civil war at Bougainville broke out in 1988 as the BRA
attempted to seek self-government for the island.
</P>
<P>
Downer reiterated the Australian government's stance that the
conflict at Bougainville can only be resolved through peaceful
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He said that Australia was ready to assist any reasonable
initiative for a political settlement of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
He will meet with his PNG counterpart Kilroy Genia in Adelaide
Thursday. He is expected to use the occasion to reinforce the
Australian government's willingness to host peace talks between
the PNG government and the BRA.
</P>
<P>
The Bougainville issue has caused a lot of fanfare in the
Australian-PNG relations. In the latest development, PNG Prime
Minister Julius Chan threatened to cut off defense links with
Australia after receiving a warning from the Australian
government. Downer told PNG officials that Australia might stop
aid to the South Pacific island nation if it used the helicopters
provided by Australia in military actions against the BRA.
</P>
<P>
Local press reported that Australia was planning to increase
humanitarian aid to Bougainville.
</P>
<P>
Kangu Beach is an important point for the drop-off of emergency
relief for the civilian population in southern Bougainville.

<P>
Also, the pattern of using the funds will be reformed, according
to the official. Projects will be targeted at the poor households
at the village level. In the past, projects were centered on the
county level.
</P>
<P>
All of the aid-the-poor projects will be administrated by the
provincial poverty alleviation offices, rather than by several
different organizations, as they were formerly, the official
noted.
</P>
<P>
Based on the established annual poverty income limit of 530
yuan per capita, a number of counties are expected to get rid of
poverty every year. But they will still be granted the current
preferential policies and the poverty-alleviation funds through
the end of this century, in an attempt to consolidate the poverty
relief results.
</P>
<P>
International financial assistance will continue to be an
important part of China's poverty-alleviation work, according to
the official.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of a World Bank aid-the-poor project has been
carried out in southwest China. The second and third phases will
be negotiated with the WB, the official said.
</P>
<P>
China will also adopt policies to encourage the international
organizations to join in the country's poverty-alleviation, the
official added.

SHANTOU, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The first phase of a port
expansion project in Shantou, in south China's Guangdong Province,

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thai Government's Quick Fix for Embattled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has
rushed to save the country's embattled economy by approving a
package of new measures to help the dwindling exports and tumbling
stock market.
</P>
<P>
The new measures adopted on Tuesday include tax cuts,
privileges for export promotion and marketing strategies.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan to rescue the economy, the government removed
the one percent duty for imports of vessels over 1,000 gross tons,
and slashed income taxes from vessel rentals from 15 percent to
one percent for domestic services for five years and from five
percent to one percent for international services.
</P>
<P>
The plan also waived income taxes on foreign crews serviced on
Thai-owned vessels operating on international routes and corporate
taxes on the replacement of old vessels used in international
transport.
</P>
<P>
The government introduced the tax cuts in a bid to cultivate
Thailand's own shipping industry and ease its almost total
reliance on foreign fleet for international freight transport
which costs a huge part of the country's budget.
</P>
<P>
To reduce production costs and spur exports, the plan
introduced import tariff cuts on some raw materials and goods used
to produce food, dairy, marine and petrochemical products, and
textiles.
</P>
<P>
Import tariffs on fish and other seafood, nuts, dry grapes,
fermented cabbage, Japanese ginger and bamboo shoots are cut from
30-60 percent to 10-30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Import tariffs on aluminum scrap and unshaped aluminum are
lowered from five percent to one percent, and those on raw
materials used for producing heating elements are axed from 20
percent to five percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a tariff cut is made from 20 percent to one
percent on normal paraffin used in the production of chlorinated
paraffin, and from 10 percent to five percent on phosphorus and
phosphoric acid.
</P>
<P>
The government also waived the tax on interests of two-year
deposits above 600,000 baht (24,000 U.S. dollars) in banks or
saving cooperatives to encourage household savings.
</P>
<P>
However, there were mixed reactions from the local public and
private sectors to the government's new measures, some of which
will be sent to the parliament for approval.
</P>
<P>
Thai Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay Virawan stressed that the
measures might cause tax drains in the short time, but in the long
run they would help boost the country's exports.
</P>
<P>
Some businessmen and analysts said that the measures came too
gentle, too late to effectively solve grave problems that have
surfaced in the country's economy, noting that they should have
been introduced six months earlier.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they doubted whether the government, which will
face a key censure debate in parliament next week, would be in
place to implement these measures.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the government had often failed to carry out
its announced plans.
</P>
<P>
The stock index at the Stock Exchange of Thailand continued to
drop by 4.29 points to 982.03 on Tuesday despite the government's
announcement of the new measures which did not seem to ignite
investors' enthusiasm.

<P>
The method, discovered in cooperation with a private plantation
company, involves the use of a mulching mat made of oil palm fruit
stalk rejects to cover the root area of seedlings, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The cover mat resembling the house mat was produced by mulching
the oil palm fruit stalks using biodegradable adhesive which could
last for about a year before decaying, Director of FRIM's Wood
Chemistry Division Hoi Why Kong was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Researchers found that an oil palm tree with the mat placed
around the root area can yield 15 percent more fruits.
</P>
<P>
The method, which is not labor intensive, reduces plantation
management work and cuts the cost of fertilizing the plants.
</P>
<P>
The mat conserves moisture, saves on watering cost, helps plant
growth during a dry spell, and prevents grass from growing around
the plant at least for eight months after planting, the
researchers said.
</P>
<P>
The mat is suitable for most plants, including rubber, oil
palm, forest and fruit trees, and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the mat was tried out on teak, mahogany
and oil palm seedlings about two months ago and the results were
most encouraging.

<HEADLINE> China to Invest More in Poverty Alleviation (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- China plans to increase its
annual spending to alleviate poverty by 40 percent beginning next
year, and continuing every year through the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
This is only one in a series of measures to speed up the
reduction of poverty, said an official from the Leading Group
Office of the Poverty Alleviation and Development under the State
Council.
</P>
<P>
Other measures include reforms in the use of state's relief
funding, and the formation of a responsibility system for
government officials, said the official.
</P>
<P>
In addition to its increased input, the central government will
ask the provincial governments to allocate a sum equal to 30 to 50
percent of the central government's input to support the
anti-poverty campaign, in keeping with their individual financial
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The central government currently earmarks 10.8 billion yuan for
poverty alleviation annually. Experts say that each poor person
needs at least 1,500 yuan to stay out of poverty, and that China
will pay a total of 100 billion yuan to eliminate poverty for the
country's 65 million poor people living under the poverty line, by
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the central government will ask the top leaders of
the local government and the Communist Party of China (CPC)
organizations to coordinate poverty relief projects.
</P>
<P>
They must eliminate poverty within their specified region in a
designated period, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Import of Rolled Steel Should be Cut, Experts Suggest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- China's import of rolled
steel soared by 24.2 percent to reach 9.14 million tons in the
first seven months of this year, with the growth rate much higher
than other imports.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the China Materials Information Center
show that of the imported steel products, there were 6.02 million
tons of steel plates, which account for 65.9 percent of the total,
and represent a rise of 63.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Overseas-funded enterprises imported 1.727 million tons of
rolled steel, an increase of 68.8 percent, according to
information from the center, which operates under the Ministry of
Internal Trade.
</P>
<P>
Such a sharp increase should be curbed, as it has already
interrupted the balance in supply and demand of China's domestic
steel market and brought the price in China down, market analysts
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
They acknowledged that in some regions in the country, the
prices of imported rolled steel have already surpassed China-made
items.

<HEADLINE> Bailey Refused Match Race With Johnson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Olympic Champion and world
100-m record holder Donavan Bailey Tuesday turned down a proposed
October match race between him and world 200-m record holder
Michael Johnson to determine the world's fastest man on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A California-based promoter was set to stage a 150-meter
showdown on October 6 at Toronto's SkyDome that would have paid
the winner one million US dollars and the loser 250,000 US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who set a world record of 19.32 seconds in Atlanta
Games, was apparently set to go for the race.
</P>
<P>
Bailey, who cut the 100-m world record down to 9.84 seconds in
winning at the Olympics, declined the invitation.
</P>
<P>
"I think some time we'll race ... but it won't happen in
1996," Bailey told CTV, a Canadian television network.
</P>
<P>
But the Canadian sprinter angered the Johnson camp by saying he
would "easily win" a race against the American, who became the
first man to win the 200-m and 400-m gold medals at the same
Olympics.

-- Baghdad lifted Tuesday its blockade of the Kurdish provinces
after regaining control of the area which escaped its grasp after
the Gulf War. The victory of the Kurdish Democratic Party over the

who will control the nuclear button during the hours when Yeltsin
is having the operation.
</P>

changed and roads lead to nowhere except towards the east.
</P>

where one third of the economy is farming, one third of companies
do not want to open the country's market to the European Union.

economic policies of Prime Minister Alain Juppe, despite his
appeasing gesture to end the freeze of payrolls in 1997. The
public employees are angry about the stagnation of payrolls this
year as well as the planned lay-off of 7,000-8,000 public
employees in the 1997 budget.

<HEADLINE> "Sea of Salt" Spurs Development of Yellow River Delta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JI'NAN, September 11 (Xinhua) -- A "sea of salt" in China's
Yellow River Delta has provided opportunities for local economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The abundant salt deposits in east China's Shandong Province
were first discovered in the 1970s, when the country began to
develop the Shengli Oilfield.
</P>
<P>
Workers found that the newly-excavated earth was covered with
white crystals. They tasted it, and said it had a salty flavor.
</P>
<P>
Geologists later verified that there is a 3,850-hectare salt
field buried under the Yellow River delta, with layers ranging
from 2,000 to 3,000 meters deep.
</P>
<P>
For centuries, local farmers have used salt bricks as building
material for their houses. Bricks made of earth containing salt
are much harder than those made of clay or other materials,
because the salty bricks have greater density.
</P>
<P>
The underground salt region, one of the largest of its kind in
Asia, has become a major salt production base in China.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, the local government has invested 169
million yuan (about 20 million US dollars) in salt development
projects.
</P>
<P>
Output value generated by 22 salt businesses now totals 200
million yuan, with taxes and profits amounting to 16 million yuan
annually.

HANOI, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is to issue the first
batch of Eurobonds in 1997 to help repay its foreign debts,
according to the latest issue of Vietnam Investment Review.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam reached a framework agreement in May with the "London
Club" group of commercial creditors on rescheduling its debt of
approximately 1 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The framework agreement called for three options for creditors,
most of which are Japanese banks. The first is a cash buyback, the
second a 30-year discount bond worth 50 percent of the principal
plus interest and the third a 30-year par bond.
</P>
<P>
Estimates put initial offerings at 100-150 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Nguyen Ngoc Minh, director of the Foreign Exchange Department
at the State Bank of Vietnam, said a Eurobond issue is not likely
until early next year when the framework agreement is approved by
the creditors.

<HEADLINE> Motivation of Israeli Reservists Declines Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Half of Israeli men say
they would not reserve duty if they were not forced to do
so, the Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
Four out of five believe the country is not doing enough
to divide the burden fairly among reservists, said the report
citing a survey conducted by an army behavioral science branch.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, 63 percent of those polled believe the
public actually encourages avoiding duty, and that there is no
public support for those who do serve.
</P>
<P>
The poll did not say how many reservists had been questioned,
nor did it give a margin of error. But the army has set up a desk
to deal with the issue, to be headed by Gaby Ashkanazy, deputy
head of the army operations.
</P>
<P>
A poll conducted among army reserve battalion commanders blamed
the difficulties in service on those who dodge duty. It also
found that society was not sufficiently supporting reservists.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some 100 reserve brigade and battalion commanders
met in Ramat Gan, a satellite town of Tel Aviv, Tuesday night
to set up a forum to combat the highly publicized drop in
motivation to do reserve duty. The officers, mostly in their
30's, raised ideas on how to tackle the growing trend.
</P>
<P>
"The break is growing and in a few years, if this
erosion continues, we'll find ourselves alone," said Arie Neiger,
a reserve paratrooper battalion commander who helped organize the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Many people don't feel that (army) service is important
enough to sacrifice days to reserve duty. Each year
thousands of people are getting out of the reservist pool and
in simple math it means that in less than a generation,
there won't be a reserve army," he warned.

He made the announcement in a broadcast and television address

</P>

Chiluba said that the provisions in the constitution ''are the

There is no need for foreign intervention,
Chiluba said, adding ''Zambian problems can only be solved by Zambians
themselves and therefore resorting to outside intervention is nothing
but a futile proposition.''

A constitution amendment was addopted earlier this year with a
clause to bar any person born of foreign parents from contesting
the presidency. This actually prevents opposition leader and
former President Kennith Kaunda from running the post in the
forthcoming general elections, because his parents immigrated
from Malawi to Zambia before the country won independence.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties argue that the constitution amendment is
not impartial and they demand to repeal it. enditem

<HEADLINE> Customer Support Important To Boeing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- An official with the Boeing
Company says that the US aircraft manufacturer wants to maintain
its market position in China with the competitive edge provided by
customer support.
</P>
<P>
The comment came today from Tim Premselaar, director of Boeing
China Support Initiatives, at an aircraft structure conference
here sponsored by Boeing's customer service branch.
</P>
<P>
Although Boeing has not built a training center in China,
Premselaar says he thinks that its customer support programs meet
the customer's needs by going to the airlines' bases and providing
services in "their environment and their facilities".
</P>
<P>
The remark can be read as comparing Boeing's service with that
of Airbus Industrie, Boeing's rival in China and elsewhere, which
developed a joint program with the China Aviation Supplies
Corp. last July to build a spares and training center near
Beijing's Capital Airport, at an initial cost of 50 million US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
When the center is built next year, Airbus can help its Chinese
customers in flight, maintenance and personnel training in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
As the fastest-growing air transport market in the world, China
has the leading aircraft manufacturers viewing it as one of the
major business arenas. Boeing now has more than 70 percent of the
Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
Airbus Industrie and the European aerospace industry have made
remarkable progress in China this year. The consortium got an
order for 27 planes worth some 1.5 billion US dollars in
April. Several European aerospace companies, led by France's
Aerospatiale, got a contract for developing a 100-seat jetliner
with China, something that was fiercely pursued by Boeing and
McDonnell-Douglas.
</P>
<P>
Boeing has 35 technical personnel stationed in China, some of
them in Beijing and some in 19 field service bases around
China. There is also a steady flow of pilots, technicians and
engineers coming and going in China from the company's
headquarters in Seattle.

<HEADLINE> Macedonia, Bulgaria to Develop Ties, Shelf Differences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Macedonia and Bulgaria should
further develop bilateral relations, putting aside differences on
language, Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov said today in
Skoplje, the country's capital.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Bulgarian National TV, Gligorov said
that Macedonia and Bulgaria are "two close nations," and their
differences, not a political issue, should be solved by historians
and scientific associations in the future.
</P>
<P>
Earlier speaking to the Skoplje Radio, Bulgarian Foreign
Minister Georgi Pirinsky expressed that it is in the interests of
both countries to develop economic ties.
</P>
<P>
"Both Bulgaria and Macedonia are devoted to the process of
stability and friendship in the Balkan area," Pirinsky added.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria was the first country to recognize Macedonia when it
announced independence in 1991, but has left dozens of accords
with Macedonia unconcluded due to the differences.

<HEADLINE> Okinawa Governor Urges Moving Live-Fire Drills to U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Okinawa Governor Masahide Ota
today called on the Japanese central government to study the
possibility of moving U.S. live-fire drills from the southernmost
island prefecture to the United States rather than to other parts
of Japan, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
Defense Agency chief Hideo Usui did not give a clear response
to the proposal during a 50-minute meeting with Ota, which was
also attended by Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda, Chief Cabinet
Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama and State Minister Saburo Okabe, who is
head of the Hokkaido and Okinawa Development Agency, Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
The Okinawa prefectural government has strongly urged the
relocation of the live-fire drills because they require a closure
of a prefectural highway, bringing inconveniences to daily life.
</P>
<P>
As for a separate plan to relocate some functions of the key
Futemma Marine base in Ginowan, Okinawa Prefecture, to other
U.S. bases within the prefecture, Vice Governor Masanori Yoshimoto
told the meeting that Okinawa would look on it as a "temporary"
measure, according to the news service.
</P>
<P>
Ota also said the Okinawa people's attitudes will soften if the
government takes measures to decrease high local unemployment
rates.
</P>
<P>
Ota suggested Tuesday night that he may reverse his earlier
opposition to acting as a proxy in forcing unwilling landowners to
renew leases on land used by the U.S. military, accepting Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's offer of 5 billion yen (50 million
U.S. dollars) to vitalize the regional economy there.
</P>
<P>
The 5 billion yen special state budget outlay was offered in
the wake of Sunday's Okinawa prefectural referendum in which an
overwhelming majority of voters backed cuts in the U.S. bases
there and a review of the 1960 Japan-U.S. Status of Forces
Agreement.
</P>
<P>
Okinawa, about 1,600 kilometers southwest of Tokyo, harbors
some 75 percent of U.S military facilities based in Japan,
although the island prefecture occupies only 0.6 percent of the
nation's total land area.

<HEADLINE> More Singaporeans Moving to Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The number of Singaporeans
who have set up homes in Australia has more than doubled in the
past 10 years, surpassing the 30,000 mark last year, the Straits
Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The number of Singaporeans residing in Australia reached 36,356
by 1995, compared to 16,734 as at June 30, 1986, the report found.
It also said that 57 percent of the Singaporeans living in
Australia hold that country's citizenship.
</P>
<P>
"These figures indicate a rising trend of Singaporeans heading
Down Under. More also seem to be leaving home for New Zealand and
Canada in recent years, although on a small scale", the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said it was significant that most of those
heading to these countries are young and highly educated. A
spokesman for the Canadian High Commission said that in general
terms, most of the Singaporeans moving to Canada are young people
with good occupational qualifications in a variety of fields.
</P>
<P>
According to the Straits Times report, some Singaporeans living
in Australia cited the stressful pace of life in Singapore as a
main reason for leaving. Others had emigrated because their
children could not get places in the universities in Singapore, or
because their families were already there.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Italy and Saudi Arabia
have signed an agreement on encouraging and protecting investment
and preventing dual taxation.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait News Agency reported today that the agreement was signed
Tuesday by Saudi Arabia Finance Minister Ibrahim Assaf and Italian
Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini, who arrived in Saudi Arabia Monday
for a two-day visit to the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in the kingdom, Dini expressed his belief that
the agreement would help promote bilateral economic cooperation,
increase trade volume and enhance investment between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The volume of trade between Saudi Arabia and Italy reached
3.2 billion U.S. dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Dini underlined his country's keenness on promoting its
relations with Saudi Arabia, which he said was a key player in the
Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Dini also discussed with a group of Saudi businessmen ways of
promoting trade and building joint investment projects.
</P>
<P>
Italy and the kingdom signed a security agreement in Riyadh
last September on fostering cooperation in combating terrorism,
drugs and organized crimes.
</P>
<P>
Dini said Italy and Saudi Arabia shared identical views on
most regional and international issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Dini said both sides agreed that the recent developments in
northern Iraq "cast a shadow over the security and stability of
the region." He also said the two sides also expressed concern
over the Israeli hard-line policies towards the Middle East peace
process and called for an immediate resumption of peace talks in
all tracks.

<HEADLINE> South Korea to Exempt Ship Importers from Taxation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 11 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will exempt
domestic ship importers from taxation from the end of this year,
the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries said here today.
</P>
<P>
Under the current regulations, importers of commercial or
fishing vessels, either new or second-hand, should pay as much as
2.5 percent of ship prices in introduction taxes.
</P>
<P>
The ship introduction tax has been cited as the major reason
for a weakening of the international competitiveness of the South
Korean oceangoing shipping and fishing industries.
</P>
<P>
"The new no-tax regulation, scheduled to be passed by the
government this month and to take effect from the end of the year,
will save local shipping companies and fishing operators about
56.3 million U.S. dollars a year," said a ministry official.
</P>
<P>
The government, the official said, will also provide greater
financial and taxation assistance to deep-sea fishing companies
and fishermen.
</P>
<P>
An additional 89 million dollars will be given to deep-sea
fishing firms next year, he added.

<P>
XIAMEN, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Fujian Investment and
Trade Seminar in Xiamen, Fujian Province in east China, has seen
26 contracts for overseas investment projects, with a total
investment of 730 million US dollars, being signed.
</P>
<P>
The projects include a highway and a bridge for the Fuzhou
Changle International Airport, which had a combined investment of
265 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The China Development Zone Investment and Trade Seminar
Delegation, which consists of officials from over 30 development
or bonded zones and border economic cooperation areas, has listed
more than 100 projects for overseas cooperation and displayed
products at the seminar.
</P>
<P>
To open China wider to the outside world, the Chinese
government has established a number of economic and technology
development zones, bonded zones and border cooperation areas in
open cities since 1984, and local areas have set up more than 400
economic and technology development zones of their own.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, the 32 state economic and technology
development zones had developed 210 square kilometers, and
approved 9,800 overseas-funded projects, 3,480 of which were in
production.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Mine Closures in Hunan Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- South China's Hunan Province
has closed down more than 5,000 illegal mines so far this year,
according to a report.
</P>
<P>
Provincial or county governments have tried to standardize
mining operations for several years but have not been very
successful. There are a number of mines that are operating
secretly and are protected by township and village officials,
"China Geology and Mineral Resources News" reports.
</P>
<P>
This year the provincial government has decided that the
standardization of mines is a task for township officials, and has
fixed a code of operation for them, the Beijing-based newspaper
says.
</P>
<P>
Township governments in turn have urged village officials to
close down illegal mines. As a result, 70 percent of the mines
have been closed down or dismantled by local people themselves,
saving police or court officials the trouble of demolishing the
illegal mines.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Exports More Coffee, Earns Less Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's exported coffee
volume increased by 40,000 tons up to July this year, but the
country's turn-over will drop by 160 million U.S. dollars due to
the falling price in coffee market, according to market experts
here.
</P>
<P>
The figures released by Vietnam Coffee Corporation showed that
up to July, Vietnam had exported 220,000 tons of coffee beans out
of 240,000 tons set by the country for the crop year between
October 1995 and September 1996.
</P>
<P>
But the price of the exported coffee from Vietnam has dropped
from the average level of 2,800 dollars per ton in the last crop
year to 1,600 dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the experts, the coffee price in Vietnamese market
would be in line with that of the world, which stood at 1,300 to
1,500 dollars per ton.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam earned 400 million dollars by exporting coffee last
year, the experts said.

<HEADLINE> Guatemalan Judge Suspends Execution of Two Criminals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Guatemala City, September 10 (Xinhua) -- With Supreme Court
intervention, a judge in Guatemala today suspended the scheduled
executions of two men sentenced to death for the rape and murder
of a 4-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
Judge Gustavo Gaitan said the executions of Pedro Castillo and
Roberto Giron, scheduled for 6 a.m. local time, were called off
following intervention by the Supreme Court and Inter-American
Human Rights Commission.
</P>
<P>
Gaitan said the Supreme Court Justices adduced there could have
been judicial irregularities in the trial and the Inter-American
Human Rights Commission would analyze the legal process at its
next session.
</P>
<P>
Gaitan appeared annoyed by the suspension of the executions at
the Canada Prison Farm in the town of Escuintla, 65 kilometers
south of this capital city, but he did not indicate the
possibility of resigning.
</P>
<P>
The executions were first suspended in late July, when lawyers
for the convicts and others filed for an injunction at the
Constitutional Court after President Alvaro Arzu rejected a call
for clemency.
</P>
<P>
The executions would have been the first carried out in
Guatemala since the military government of General Efrain Rios
Montt, who ruled Guatemala from 1982 to 1983.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Former Indian PM Obsessed with Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 11 (Xinhua) -- India's former prime
minister and President of the Congress Party P.V. Narasimha Rao,
obsessed by corruption cases as well as dissidents within the
party, is trying his best to keep his leadership position in the
Congress.
</P>
<P>
The naming of Rao as an accused in two corruption cases so far
-- the Lakhubhai Pathak cheating case of 100,000 US dollars and
the case of bribing four MPs -- has led even his hard-core
loyalists to press panic buttons.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the multi-crore urea import scandal, in which his son
P.V. Prabhakara Rao is alleged to be involved, hangs like the
sword of Damocles sword over the elder Rao's head.
</P>
<P>
The Delhi court last month summoned Rao for the 100,000 US
dollar cheating case and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)
questioned Rao twice in his residence about the pay-off case to
four MPs this month by the Congress ministers in 1983 for their
support to the then Congress government.
</P>
<P>
According to press reports, the former prime minister has been
involved in at least five corruption cases, including the 18
billion US dollar hawala case.
</P>
<P>
Rao is making history because a Congress leader is facing a
criminal charge for the first time in this country and no former
prime minister or president of a major political party has ever
been accused in a case of cheating.
</P>
<P>
Whether the charge sticks or not, the ultimate damage to the
Congress Party has already been done. Rao's plight is no different
from his hawala-tainted colleagues.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Former Indian PM Obsessed with Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The oust-Rao campaign by dissidents has intensified since the
start of the investigation into the pay-off case to four MPs by
the Congress leaders in 1993 for their support to the Congress
government. The CBI has already arrested the four MPs and raided
their residents a few days back.
</P>
<P>
The signature campaign for the requisition of All-India
Congress Committee (AICC) meeting launched by dissidents has begun
mounting pressures on Party President Rao to convene the Party
session immediately after the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections
early next month.
</P>
<P>
The dissidents have also demanded a special session of the
Congress parliamentary party to discuss the corruption issue.
</P>
<P>
While a majority of the 19-member Congress Working Committee,
the top policy-making body of the Party, is in favor of the Party
session to discuss the corruption issue and the worst ever
electoral defeat in the Congress history, Rao has refused to agree
to hold the Party meeting.
</P>
<P>
His refusal is being attributed to his apprehension that this
would provide his detractors with a forum and opportunity to force
a leadership change.
</P>
<P>
"He fears that his resignation from the Congress presidency
would open the floodgates of litigation," said a Rao loyalist on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Succumbed to the mounting pressure from the dissident camp as
well as the newly-emerged pressure group, Rao finally announced
Tuesday a special session of the Congress parliamentary party, to
be held either on September 12 or 13 to discuss the corruption
issue that has tarnished the image of the Party and put the
leadership on the defensive.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Ministers Asked to Solve Tariff Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- A sector of the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) today decided to ask the
Association's economic ministers solve a problem over the timing
of tariff reductions on highly sensitive agricultural products
such as rice and sugar.
</P>
<P>
"This is a matter for the ministers to consider," Thai
delegation leader Krirk-krai Jirapaet told reporters after two
days of talks in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
"We have discussed this for a long time and it would be futile
for us to discuss it further," said Krirk-krai, who heads the Thai
Commerce Ministry's Business Economics Department.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN economic ministers will meet for three days from
Wednesday, firstly in the forum of the AFTA Council, a body which
coordinates efforts to achieve an ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) by
2003.
</P>
<P>
Among ASEAN states, Thailand and Indonesia, in particular, have
continued to interpret differently an earlier AFTA Council
agreement. This was that unprocessed farm products considered
"sensitive" should be phased into the Common Effective
Preferential Tariff (CEPT) Scheme for AFTA not later than 2010.
</P>
<P>
Thailand said the year 2010 should be the deadline for tariff
reductions on sensitive agricultural products while Indonesia
insisted it should begin the phase-in process from 2010.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN's seven members -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam -- have identified
three lists of products in the CEPT Scheme: an inclusion list, a
temporary exclusion list and a sensitive list.

<HEADLINE> Japan's PM Offers Okinawa Special Outlay on Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto has offered the Okinawa prefecture a special state
budget outlay of 5 billion yen (about 45.5 million U.S. dollars)
to vitalize the regional economy, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The offer was aimed at alleviating objections by Okinawan
residents to the heavy U.S. military presense there.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released Tuesday after meeting with Okinawan
Governor Masahite Ota, Hashimoto promised the government's
commitment to Okinawa bases cuts and the development of the
prefecture.
</P>
<P>
The statement also promised to discuss with the United States
the U.S. military deployment in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Okinawa is Japan's southernmost island prefecture where the
economy lags behind partly because of the U.S. military's
occupation of one-tenth of its land area.
</P>
<P>
Okinawa, which constitutes less than 1 percent of Japan's total
land area, accounts for 75 percent of the land used by the 47,000
U.S. military personnel stationed in Japan.

ULAN BATOR, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The leading body of the
Mongolian Democratic Union has recently appointed G. Ganbold to
replace Prime Minister Mendsaihani Enhsaihan as its General
Secretary, according to reports here yesterday.
</P>

such posts as Vice Chairman of the Mongolian University Students
Union, Secretary of the Central Secretariat of the Mongolian
Revolutionary Youth League and Executive Council Chairman of the
Mongolian Youth Union.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Renato Ruggiero, General
Director of the World Trade Organization (WTO), said here today
that regionalization could be a serious obstacle for free trade.
</P>
<P>
Regionalization is a very important tool for promoting free
trade among countries that are in similar situations, noted the
official, who arrived here on Monday for a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the strong growth of regional systems can be,
in the medium-term, a brake to the expansion of free trade.
</P>
<P>
Ruggiero made these remarks when he was attending the
inauguration of a seminar sponsored by the Foundation of Argentine
Exporters being held in this capital city.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that there is no contradiction between the
multilateralism being proclaimed by the WTO and trade blocs such
as South America's Southern Cone Common Market, or Mercosur.
</P>

The top WTO official, an Italian national, is scheduled to meet

TOKYO, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Customers have withdrawn 3.17
billion Japanese yen (about 30 million U.S. dollars) over the past
two days from a financially troubled bank in Tokyo, Kyodo News
Service said today.
</P>
<P>
Customers withdrew 534 million yen (about five million dollars)
from the Musashino Shinkin Bank on Monday and 2.64 billion yen
(about 24.7 million dollars) on Tuesday. This amounted to about
5.2 percent of the bank's deposits balance at the end of last
week, according to a bank official.
</P>
<P>
But the Shinkin bank would get full financial support from the
Zenshinren Bank, a national association of credit associations, if
the withdrawal move continued, Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
The Musashino Shinkin Bank mainly operates in the western part
of the Tokyo metropolitan area. It has 58 billion yen (about 544
million dollars) in outstanding lending, including bad loans
accounting for 25 billion yen (about 234.5 million

<HEADLINE> Nepali Parliament Discusses Treaty with India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali parliament today
began to discuss a Nepal-India border river development treaty
just two days after the main opposition decided to support it
conditionally.
</P>
<P>
It is expected the joint session of the upper and lower houses
will vote on the Mahakali treaty Thursday, parliamentary sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The Nepal-India treaty on the integrated development of the
Mahakali river, Nepal's western boundary with India, was signed
last February by the two governments in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
Nepal's main opposition, the Communist Party of Nepal (United
Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML), Monday announced its conditional
support for the treaty by urging the governments of Nepal and
India to fulfill several preconditions before ratifying the
treaty.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML party demanded assurances from the two governments
on the solution of some bilateral issues as preconditions for the
treaty's ratification in the Nepali parliament.
</P>
<P>
The issues raised by the party, which holds the key to the
ratification of the treaty, include revision of the 1950
Nepal-India Friendship Treaty, Nepal's long-term transit facility
via India, border demarcation, Bhutanese refugee problem, removal
of the Indian troops from a far-western Nepali district, and
India's power purchase from Nepal.
</P>
<P>
CPN-UML leaders reiterated Tuesday that the Mahakali treaty
would not be ratified without obtaining written commitments from
the Nepali and Indian governments on these demands.
</P>
<P>
With its 88 MPs in the 205-seat lower house, the CPN-UML's
stand will be crucial to the fate of the Mahakali treaty as its
ratification needs a two-third majority support in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The treaty has been approved earlier by the cabinet in India
where a cabinet approval is sufficient for its ratification,
according to a Nepali source on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some small leftist parties in Nepal are staging
protests and mass rallies these days against the Nepal-India water
treaty, which they claim is against Nepal's national interest as
it provides fewer benefits for Nepal than for India.
</P>
<P>
Protesters Tuesday burnt the effigies of Nepali and Indian
prime ministers in Kathmandu and held demonstrations in some
other parts of the country, but no violence was reported.

KIEV, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine and Croatia today
initialed an agreement of friendship and cooperation that will be
signed by their heads of states when Ukraine's President Pavel
Lazarenko visits Croatia late this year,
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Ukraine' Foreign Minister Grennady
Udovenko at a press conference after a meeting with his Croatian
counterpart Mate Granic who ended his two-day visit here today.
</P>
<P>
Udovenko said Granic's current visit of historical significance
will help restore relations between the two nations suspended
during the war in former Yugoslavia and will activate political
cooperation in future.
</P>
<P>
The two nations have a vast vista for cooperation in the fields
such as airplane manufacturing, metallurgical and pharmacy
industries, added the Ukraine's minister.
</P>
<P>
Granic, also deputy prime minister of Croatia, agreed that his
visit has created good conditions to improve the relationship
between the countries. As friendly neighbors, he said, Croatia and
Ukraine have no pending issues in their relations.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the two sides will expand cooperation in the
political and military fields, and have agreed to contribute to
restoring peace in former Yugoslavia. He also praised Ukraine's
constructive stand in the peacekeeping process of the region.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Granic met with Ukraine's President Leonid
Kuchma, Prime Minister Pavel Lazarenko, Parliament Chairman
Alexandr Moroz and Defense Minister Alesandr Kuzmuk respectivley.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine, which sent its military units to join the
U.N. peacekeeping forces in former Yugoslavia, has been seeking
restoration of economic ties with the former Yugosalav region
since the agreement for Bosnian peace was signed last December.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Ukraine suffered a loss of four billions
U.S. dollars due to the suspension of links with Croatia after the
United Nations imposed economic sanctions against the former
Yugoslav region.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also signed agreements of cooperation on
tourism and avoidance of dual taxation.

TOKYO, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar broke the
109.50 yen level on the Tokyo market early today, continuing the
upward trend seen on overseas markets last night.
</P>
<P>
The dollar was changing hands at 109.85-88 yen at 9 a.m.today,
nearly unchanged from last Tuesday's quotes of 109.80-90 yen in
New York and London -- while it was then trading at 109.26-29 yen
at 5 p.m. in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time in two months that the U.S. dollar had
nearly hit 110 yen in New York. Market players attributed the
gain mainly to market expectations of a wider interest rate gap
between the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar also gained ground against the
German mark, due to a stagnant economy in Germany.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Seek Freer Flow of Goods Within ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will seek the
liberalization of transport links within the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) at the ASEAN Economic Ministers'
annual meeting in Jakarta this week, said reports reaching here
today.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted Thai Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay Virawan as
saying he believed that easier cross-border transit of
goods-loaded trucks is important in ensuring the near-zero tariffs
of the ASEAN Free Trade Area lead to freer trade.
</P>
<P>
Thailand will present a proposal at the meeting to allow
goods-carrying trucks to travel between two ASEAN member countries
without having to transfer the goods to another vehicle.
</P>
<P>
Thai negotiators will consider how to use the proposal to
bargain in Thailand's best interests, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Krirk-Krai Jirapaet, director-general of Thailand's Business
Economics Department, said earlier that ASEAN still had to work
out how to eliminate the accompanying security risks for ASEAN
countries.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam and two prospective
ASEAN members -- Laos and Myanmar, which have land borders with
each other, are expected to benefit from the plan, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Thai transport business operators are worried about possible
competition from other countries, in particular from Malaysia
which has a transport agreement with Laos, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
Thailand currently has a memorandum on transport of goods with
Malaysia, under which trucks from Malaysia are allowed to reach as
far as Hat Yai in southern Thailand.

MEXICO CITY, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
economic news brief from Latin American countries over the past
few days:
</P>
<P>
SANTIAGO -- During the first seven months of this year, the
five biggest airlines in Chile transported 1.37 million passengers
within the country, an increase of 23.3 percent from the same
period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from Chile's Civil Aviation Board, the

oil during this year, up 135 percent from last year, according to
the National Association of African Palm Growers (ANCUPA, its
acronym in Spanish).
</P>
<P>
On average, a ton of African palm oil is being quoted at 500
U.S. dollars on international markets and 540 dollars on the
Ecuadoran market. According to a report by the Agriculture
Ministry, fruit and oil output will approach 919,600 tons and
183,900 tons, respectively, this year.
</P>
<P>
PANAMA CITY -- Panama exported 279.26 million dollars worth of

<HEADLINE> Singapore Showing More Interest In Central China Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Singaporean business people
have been taking a closer look at investment in Central China's
Henan Province, which approved 56 projects backed by 200 million
US dollars in Singaporean investment, from 1994 to June of this
year.
</P>
<P>
There were only 50 such projects with less than 100 million US
dollars in investment in the 1985-93 period.
</P>
<P>
One Singaporean businessman attributed the success to mutual
benefit. He noted that "Henan, which has a population of 90
million, is a key energy-producing province but lacks funds,
advanced technology and international trade experience, and
Singapore, which has a population of three million, is capital
rich but short of natural resources and a market."
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed that there is a good future for
cooperation in tourism, transport, management, industry and
high-tech industrial development.

<HEADLINE> Balkan Countries Plan to Cooperate in Natural Gas Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- If natural gas companies in
Balkan countries could achieve cooperation in gas transportation
and utilization, Bulgaria would probably become Europe's huge
storehouse of natural gas, a report of the Bulgarian Telegraph
Agency said today.
</P>
<P>
The report, covering the just-concluded cooperation meeting of
natural gas industries in Balkan countries, said cooperation was
the only choice for all oil and gas companies in Balkan countries
to survive market competition.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting, jointly organized by Bulgarian Natural Gas
Co. and the Association of Balkan and Black Sea Oil and Gas
Industries, focused on the current situation and future
development of gas industry in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
The report said representatives agreed that Bulgaria's
geographical position has made it a key country to transmit gas
into Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed a proposal of extending Bulgaria's
870-kilometer-long gas pipeline to 1,500 kilometers in the coming
15 years.
</P>
<P>
A working meeting designed to draw up a draft map of gas
pipelines in the Balkan region is expected to be held here on

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Offers Open Sky Policy for ASEAN States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
Tuesday offered a full open sky policy for the ASEAN eastern
subregional growth area linking several Indonesian provinces with
Brunei, Malaysia and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"Any airlines of the involved countries are welcome to serve
the Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines growth area on a
point-to-point basis, not as stopovers to other overseas
destinations," Minister of Transportation Haryanto Dhanutirto said
at a hearing in the parliament, official sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that government-owned air carriers from
Indonesia, Brunei, Malaysia and the Philippines are invited to
link Indonesia's three major cities in the growth area -- Pontanak
in west Kalimantan, Balipapan in east Kalimantan and Manado in
north Sulawesi -- with major cities in relevant provinces in the
other three participating countries.
</P>
<P>
"But the airlines are not allowed to proceed to other
destinations beyond the growth area," Haryanto said.
</P>
<P>
The eastern growth area of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) was formed in 1994 to boost cooperation in
tourism, industry and agriculture. It initially comprised Brunei,
Sabah and Sarawak in Malaysia, east and west Kalimantan and north
Sulawesi in Indonesia and southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Several months ago, Indonesia proposed to expand its part in
the growth area to include central and south Kalimantan, central
southeast and south Sulawesi, Maluku and Irian Jaya to prepare the
country to face tariff-free competition after the year 2003 under
the ASEAN Free Trade Area agreement.

</P>
<P>
Guangxi borders Viet Nam, and is surrounded by Yunnan, Guizhou,

the building of basic facilities in Guangxi.
</P>
<P>
Inter-region economic cooperation agreements have resulted in
17.3 billion yuan in output value and two billion yuan in taxes
for the autonomous region, plus income, said the officials.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a number of inter-region common commodity markets
have been built, where 55 billion yuan worth of goods have been

<HEADLINE> Perot Announces Running Mate for U.S. Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Reform Party
presidential candidate Ross Perot announced on Tuesday night that
economist Pat Choate will be his running mate in his bid for the
White House.
</P>
<P>
Perot and Choate, 55, co-authored in 1993 the book "Save Your
Job, Save Our Country: Why NAFTA (North American Free Trade
Agreement) Must Be Stopped Now."
</P>
<P>
"He is a person of intellect, courage, integrity and grit,"
Perot said of Choate in a 30-minute paid campaign advertisement on
the CBS television network.
</P>
<P>
"He knows the system as few do. He knows what's wrong with
it. We agree what's wrong with it. His views are your views out
there across America," he said.
</P>
<P>
Choate, the son of sharecropper, was born in Texas. He earned
a doctorate in economics from the University of Oklahoma and is
the author of six books.
</P>
<P>
Choate gained national prominence when he wrote "Agents of
Influence" in 1991. The book detailed how Washington bureaucrats
became lobbyists for foreign interests.
</P>
<P>
"I know Washington, and I know that it cannot be changed from
the inside," Choate said on tonight's program. "I also know that
it cannot be changed by either of the two major political parties."
</P>
<P>
"In Washington today, too many people profit too much from
private gains at the public expense to permit real reform," said
Choate.
</P>
<P>
Perot, who founded the Reform Party last year, accepted the
party's nomination August 28 following a mail-in ballot from party
members.
</P>
<P>
Perot received about 19 percent of the vote in the 1992
president election, largely using his own money to finance the
campaign. This year Perot has decided to accept federal funds for
his race which, however, will limit his personal contribution to
50,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to the Federal Election Commission, Perot has
received a check for slightly more than 29 million dollars for his
campaign. He became eligible for the funding because of his
showing in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Southwestern Chinese City's Role As Regional Hub </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- When the topic of competing
on the world market comes up, business and government leaders in
southwest China talk about Beihai, a coastal city in the Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region, which expects to become the major
foreign trade center in the region.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the city has been trying to play a bigger role
in parts of southwest China, including Yunnan, Guizhou, and
Sichuan provinces.
</P>
<P>
During the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-95), the city invested
over 10 billion yuan in highways and ports, and a 100,000-line
programmable telephone network.
</P>
<P>
The urban area was also enlarged from 7 sq km to 47 sq km, and
better water and power supplies, and traffic network provided.
</P>
<P>
Its airport, one of the largest in the region, now has 74
flights weekly, and its port handled five million tons of cargo
last year. During the Ninth Five-Year Plan, the port facilities
will be expanded.
</P>
<P>
From 1991 to 1995, its gross domestic product increased at an
annual rate of 20 percent and was worth more than 10 billion yuan
in 1995, putting the city 25th among all Chinese cities in terms
of per capita gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
A large number of industrial enterprises have been set up, 15
of which have yearly production worth more than 100 million yuan
(12.5 million US dollars) in chemical fibers, power, and oil.
</P>
<P>
Southwestern provinces have increased ties with Beihai, and 80
percent of the 4,000 cooperative businesses in Beihai are from
these provinces.
</P>
<P>
Local people are pinning their hopes on the railway between
Nanning and Kunming, provincial capital of Yunnan, which is
scheduled to be completed by July of next year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Evacuating Iraqi Refugees Into Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. forces are evacuating
thousands of fleeing refugees from northern Iraq into Turkey,
U.S. officials said today.
</P>
<P>
The operation was covertly launched at dust on Monday by the
American troops, stationed throughout southeast Turkey, and was
aided by their French and British counterparts policing an air
exclusion over northern Iraq, the officials were quoted by the
local press as saying.
</P>
<P>
The refugees who fled northern Iraq, where a Kurdish faction
aligned with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is taking over
control, are those who were opposed to the Iraqi authority and
thus escaping possible retribution from Iraqi forces.
</P>
<P>
The evacuation mission was carried out largely with huge U.S.
transport helicopters.
</P>
<P>
Saddam, seeking to discourage an exodus, had reportedly
declared a general amnesty for all Kurds and lifted travel and
trade restrictions between Iraq and the northern semi-autonomous
Kurdish areas, imposed at the end of the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. officials said the refugees might never see Turkish
soil if Ankara has its way. The comments were referring to
Turkey's "reservations" over the U.S. moves.
</P>
<P>
They said that Secretary of State Warren Christopher received a
"chilly reception" from Turkish foreign Minister Tansu Ciller when
he discussed it with her by telephone on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ciller, the former prime minister, asked Christopher if the
United States could give Turkey "a few days breathing room" to
consider the U.S. initiative.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish foreign minister was afraid of a repeat of the
aftermath of the Gulf War when several hundreds of thousands of
Iraqi refugees thronged into Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Ciller was also concerned about the possible infiltration of
Kurdish extremists under the guise of fleeing danger in Iraq, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Aides to Christopher said he told Ciller the United States
would "take her concerns into account," but the "rapid pace of
events on the ground might overtake the courtesy of diplomatic
consultations."
</P>
<P>
Marc Grossman, the U.S. ambassador in Ankara, is supervising
the operation and leading day-to-day consultations with Turkey on
the mission.

investment, is being launched by a firm registered as Private
Medium Electricity Company Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The location for the project has already been selected at
Hambantota in the deep south of Sri Lanka and initial steps have
been taken to install the wind mills on a 375-acre plot of land,
the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The company expects to initially supply 25 megawatts of
electricity to the national power grid and later increase the
power supply to 50 megawatts daily. It is estimated that 25
megawatts of electricity is sufficient to meet the requirement of
the entire Hambantota district.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka, which depends on hydro power for 84 percent of its
electricity supply, underwent a severe power crisis starting in
March due to delayed rains this year.
</P>
<P>
Power cuts of up to ten hours a day had to be enforced
throughout the country to tide over the crisis. A weekly one-hour
power cut is now still effective in Sri Lanka.

BRASILIA -- Brazil's farm machinery production dropped 38.5
percent during the first eight months of this year, compared to
14,600 units in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The drop was mainly due to the sharp reduction in government
farm loans, which shrank to 420 million dollars in 1995 from 970
million dollars a year ago, said the Brazilian Association of Farm
Machine Manufacturers. In 1995, farm machinery production dropped
85 percent, to 12,992 units.

<HEADLINE> Colombia's Drug Trafficking Revenues Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's revenues
from drug trafficking dropped from 6.5 percent of its gross
domestic product (GDP) in 1980-85 to 3.5 percent in 1994-95, an
investigator claims.
</P>
<P>
Roberto Steiner, an investigator for the Foundation for Higher
Education and Development, said that in the 1980s, the dollars
from the laundered drug money accounted for nearly 70 percent of
Colombia's exports. Now it is less than 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Between 1980-85, revenues from drug trafficking reached 2.4
billion U.S. dollars in Colombia, making up 6.5 percent of the GDP
and 68 percent of its exports.
</P>
<P>
During the period 1986-90, when the government of President
Virgilio Barco intensified the war against the Medellin Cartel,
money laundering dropped to 1.8 billion dollars, which
represented 4.7 percent of the GDP and 30.8 percent of its exports.
</P>
<P>
In 1991-93, when extradition was prohibited and the
surrendering policy was established with more lenient sentences,
average revenues from drug trafficking shot up again. The money
laundering totaled 2.46 billion dollars, accounting for 5 percent
of the GDP and one-third of exports.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, the money laundering dropped slightly in
Colombia, amounting to 2.4 billion dollars, 3.5 percent of the GDP
and 25 percent of its exports.

<HEADLINE> Sensitive List Not to Affect ASEAN Free Trade: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The insistence of Indonesia
and the Philippines on pushing back the deadline for the reduction
of tariffs on sensitive farm products will not damage the spirit
of free trade in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN), the grouping's secretary general said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the difference among ASEAN member countries on
the sensitive list, Ajit Singh said last night that waiting to
phase out the tariffs on sensitive products like rice and sugar is
not a big issue in ASEAN because they represent less than one
percent of all tariffs in the region.
</P>
<P>
"That's peanuts compared with the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA)
as a whole,' ASEAN officials quoted Singh as saying.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials from the seven members of ASEAN -- Brunei,
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam -- ended their two-day closed-door meeting last night,
paving the way for an AFTA Council meeting today and a ministerial
meeting Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Unprocessed agricultural products in ASEAN make up 261 tariff
lines, or about 0.5 percent of the total of more than 47,000
tariff lines in the region.
</P>
<P>
In terms of trade value, unprocessed agricultural products
represent only 0.05 percent of the total intra-ASEAN trade in AFTA
goods. "They are also not heavily traded items in the ASEAN,"
Singh said.
</P>
<P>
At the senior officials' meeting, Indonesia and the Philippines
refused to accept the 2010 deadline adopted last year by the AFTA
Council for including unprocessed agricultural products in the
tariff liberalization agenda under the Common Effective
Preferential Tariff (CEPT) scheme.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia proposed phasing in its highly-sensitive farm
products, notably rice and sugar, into the CEPT on January 1,
2010, and ending the process in 2020.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, which has a relatively developed agro-industry, said
that Indonesia and the Philippines could undermine the spirit of
trade liberalization in the region.
</P>
<P>
The issue is expected to be brought up again at the AFTA
Council meeting today.
</P>
<P>
Singh said he believed that the AFTA Council meeting will
proceed smoothly because the member countries have been making
progress in AFTA.

<HEADLINE> Thai Government Suspends Pig Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government Tuesday
bowed to demands by small-scale pig raisers to suspend its plan to
import pigs from China and Malaysia, local daily the Bangkok Post
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of pig raisers and Prime Minister's
Secretary-General Dej Boonlong reached the compromise at the
government house after the government agreed to suspend its pig
imports if the swine raisers lower the price of their pigs.
</P>
<P>
The government wants pork prices to be no more than 75 baht
(about three U.S. dollars) a kilogram on the market. The price has
now gone up to 90 baht (about 3.6 U.S. dollars) a kilogram.
</P>
<P>
On September 3, the Thai cabinet approved total imports of
30,000 live or slaughtered pigs a month from China and Malaysia
until December to solve the problem of the soaring price of pork
in the country.

<HEADLINE> Rules on Funds Crucial: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese bank
official Tuesday called the establishment of laws and regulations
governing the funds industry, an urgent task for the country's
financial sector, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Yin Jieyan, vice-governor of the People's
Bank of China (PBOC), as saying that financial authorities need to
greatly strengthen their ability to regulate the fledgling
industry.
</P>
<P>
Yin said this while delivering a speech at a two-day seminar on
fund management, which was co-organized by PBOC and the Royal
Institute of International Affairs of Britain.
</P>
<P>
According to Yin, two regulations -- one on
securities-investment fund management and the other on the
Sino-foreign cooperative fund-management companies -- are in the
process of final revision, examination and approval by the
relevant authorities.
</P>
<P>
The promulgation of the two regulations is necessary because
most of the existing funds established in China by the provinces
are small ones and are operated in a non-standardized manner, said
Yin.
</P>
<P>
However, the funds, whose inauguration had served as part of
the country's experiment to use diversified financial instruments,
have become an important ingredient of China's financial market,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Experts at the seminar said that related departments should
fully realize the funds' status as an imports instrument with
various functions including standardizing investment in the
securities market, stabilizing the stock market and protecting
investors.
</P>
<P>
PBOC official Ouyang Weimin said a batch of fund-management
companies need to be fostered for healthy development of the
industry.
</P>
<P>
China's first mutual fund was founded in 1992 in Shenzhen and
the industry is still at an early stage of development.
</P>
<P>
With a limited number of listed companies, which means limited
scope for the funds to realize profitable investment, most of the
capital is spent on industrial investment rather than as
investment in securities, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Almost all the funds in China take the form of close end, under
which most of the operational aspects are fixed due to the weak
liquidity of the capital.
</P>
<P>
However, they said the close-end form is coincidentally suited
to industrial investment.
</P>
<P>
They suggested that treasury-bond funds be established in the
near future to facilitate the operation of open-end funds, which
allows flexible operations in issuing, term and trade.
</P>
<P>
A sufficient amount and variety of T-bonds in the country and
complete sales networks all create conditions for the
establishment of T-bond funds.
</P>
<P>
T-bonds have totalled 500 billion yuan (60 billion US dollars)
by the end of last year since they were first issued in 1981 and
the variety is a base for compound investment, the experts said.

<HEADLINE> Chechens Back Peace Deal, Discuss New Government, Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of Chechen
political and social groups today met in Grozny to discuss a
future government and an election in the region, showing support
for a peace agreement signed with Russia last month.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution, more than 300 delegates approved the peace
plan and proposals to create a coalition government, the local
press reported.
</P>
<P>
They also backed the Russian troop withdrawal scheduled under
the deal, which was signed on August 31 between separatist
chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov and Russian envoy Alexander Lebed.
</P>
<P>
They called on the United Nations and the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to supervise closely the
election and the forming of the future government.
</P>
<P>
Besides Maskhadov, who chaired the congress, participants at
the meeting included Gaid-Khasan Abumuslimov, vice president of
the self-claimed "Chechnya Republic," and representatives of
political and social groups, the Chechen parliament and the OSCE,
the ITAR-tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Maskhadov proposed that all political forces in the breakaway
republic, including the Moscow-backed administration of Doku
Zavgayev, be represented in the new government.
</P>
<P>
Zavgayev, who did not attend the meeting, denied in Moscow that
his cabinet members would participate in the coalition.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Moscow today, he accused the rebels of
attempting to set up an independent government to break away from
Russia.
</P>
<P>
The congress began in Grozny soon after most Russian troops and
Chechen rebels left Grozny under the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Chechen conflict started in December 1994 when President
Boris Yeltsin dispatched Russian troops to the rebel
republic. Tens of thousands of people have died in the conflict.

<TEXT>

BANGKOK, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Efforts to convince the
United States to lift its embargo on wild shrimp imports from
Thailand are gathering momentum.
</P>
<P>
US officials will arrive in Thailand in four weeks to check
that turtle excluder devices have been fitted to trawlers' fishing
nets, according to local daily the Bangkok Post today.
</P>
<P>
The US imposed the embargo on Thailand and many other countries
on May 1. However, most Thai shrimp exports to the US are
unaffected by the ban as the shrimps are bred on farms.
</P>
<P>
Thai Agriculture and Cooperatives Minister Suvit Khunkitti said
Tuesday that the US recognized that Thailand had made great
efforts to solve the problem and would allow the exports to resume
when it was sure Thai trawlers were equipped with the devices.
</P>
<P>
Thai processed food manufacturers and exporters of frozen
shrimps had agreed to absorb the cost of the devices, the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
Fisheries Association President Vicharn Sirichai-Ekkawat said
owners of about 1,500 trawlers had already offered to fit the
devices.

<HEADLINE> Colombia's Vice President Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's Vice
President Humberto de la Calle resigned from the senate today and
insisted on President Ernesto Samper also stepping down.
</P>
<P>
In a ceremony at the Tequendama Hotel, de la Calle said the
reason for his decision was to avoid a civil war in the country.
</P>
<P>
The vice president said he had presented his resignation
formally to senate president Luis Fernando Londono Capurro and
would devote his time to combating corruption and patronage
prevailing in the present administration.
</P>
<P>
He declared that he was convinced of the involvement of
drug-related money in Ernesto Samper's presidential campaign in
1994.
</P>
<P>
The outgoing vice president emphasized that the resignation of
President Samper was the only solution to the domestic political
crisis in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
He said it was the responsibility of the congress to choose a
successor who would assume initially the duties of the vice
president, and then take over the reins of the country.
</P>
<P>
He believed there was an urgent need to convene a government of
national unity, or promote a mediator who would determine the
destiny of Colombia.
</P>
<P>
He made the same request on September 5 in a letter to
President Samper, calling for a government of national unity that
would be able to rally the whole nation in the crusade needed to
salvage Colombia.
</P>
<P>
But the request was turned down by Samper who emphasized in a
letter that the solution was in the hands of the vice president:
to stay or leave the government.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Samper and de la Calle have deteriorated
following de la Calle's lukewarm support for the president when
the scandal broke over the million peso donations from drug
cartels to Samper's presidential campaign in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with article 205 of the constitution, the
congress will have to call a plenary session to choose a new
vice president.
</P>
<P>
The session should be called by President Samper within the
next 30 days so that the chambers can accept the resignation.

<HEADLINE> Helms-Burton Act No Bar to Cuba's Capital Inflow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Cuba reports a constant
inflow of foreign investment in spite of the enactment of the
U.S. Helms-Burton Act which strengthened the embargo against Cuba
by penalizing foreigners who invest there.
</P>
<P>
Jorge Lezcano, Chairman of Cuba's International Relations
Committee, said that since March the Havana government had signed
at least 20 contracts with foreign investors to establish
cooperative businesses on the island.
</P>
<P>
The Helms-Burton Act seeks to frighten foreign investment away
from Cuba by threat of legal actions against companies and
business people who "traffick" in confiscated property in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Lezcano, who is visiting Panama in his capacity also as a Cuban
parliamentarian, told legislators of this Central American country
that Havana had received a number of investment proposals since
March, when U.S. President Bill Clinton signed the act.
</P>
<P>
A Canadian consortium was planning to invest about 400 million
U.S. dollars in a tourism facility on the island, he said.
</P>
<P>
Upcoming investments involving foreign capital were projected
in the sugar industry and the petroleum, tobacco and liquor
sectors, said Lezcano.
</P>
<P>
He said that a group of Panamanian entrepreneurs wanted to
invest in the island, but were being cautious.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the influx of investments, the Helms-Burton Law had
created concern among foreign investors, the Cuban official noted.
</P>
<P>
As for trade with Panama, Mexico exported 77.9 million dollars
worth of goods to Cuba while importing 208,000 dollars worth of
merchandise from the island.
</P>
<P>
Lezcano said that he was confident there would be an increase
in bilateral trade and that most of the trade would be carried on
through the Duty Free Zone of Colon in Panama.

<HEADLINE> Ningxia to Complete Six Bridges Across Yellow River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Six highway bridges will be
completed on the Ningxia section of the Yellow River this year.
</P>
<P>
It will mean the 397 kilometer long section of the river in the
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region will average one road bridge every
57 kilometers, ranking first among regions along the the Yellow
River for the number of crossings.
</P>
<P>
The first Yellow River bridge in Ningxia in northwest China was
completed in 1970, and since 1983, another four bridges have been
added.
</P>
<P>
The technological requirements and the scale of the new
bridges, have been constantly raised, local experts pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The Zhongwei Yellow River bridge, now under construction,
represents a good example of the advancement. It is 1,115 meters
long, 14 meters wide, and is costing over 74 million yuan (8.963
million US dollars) to build.
</P>
<P>
The new bridges are expected to greatly facilitate exchanges
between Ningxia and neighboring regions, including Inner Mongolia,
Shaanxi, and Gansu.

<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- One of Beijing's major
department stores has joined the Industrial and Commercial Bank of
China to issue a new type of credit card to be used for shopping,
the first of its kind in the city.
</P>
<P>
The new Peony Card was the brainchild of the Xidan Market
Group, which decided to join forces with the Beijing branch of the
bank, to increase its business, since the card can also be used
for customers' bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
The move comes in response to the international developmental
trend of banks and large corporations working together, and is an
effort to sharpen businesses' competitive edge while increasing
banks' profits, economists say.
</P>
<P>
People who use the Peony card can get special bargains at the
city's Xidan Market and other stores in the group's chain of

<HEADLINE> ADB Doubts Philippines' Current Account Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) said that the Philippines' current account deficit could
actually be bigger than government-reported figures, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Manila-based bank said official figures placed the
country's current account deficit (c/a deficit) at 4.5 percent of
the gross domestic product (GDP) in 1994 and 2.5 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The c/a deficit reflects the level by which foreign inflows
from trade and payments fall short of outflows. After the
financial crisis in Mexico which was borne out of huge c/a
deficit, foreign investors have looked at the figure as alarm
signals of economies' structural weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
In its economic review of the Philippines released on Tuesday,
the bank raised concern that there may be a "double-counting" in
the volume of foreign inflows from exporters and foreign investors
who park their earnings in foreign-currency deposits and withdraw
these in pesos.
</P>
<P>
It said peso conversions in the country rose to 4.7 billion US
dollars in 1995 from about 2.8 billion US dollars in 1994 and only
400 million US dollars in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the country's "unusually large" negative errors
and omissions may have overstated the official amount of foreign
funds and the c/a receipts, hence underestimated the c/a deficit
and the capital flow in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
However, the bank paints a rosy picture for the Philippine
economy at the same review, saying its gross national product is
projected to grow between 6-7 percent annually over the next few
years.

MANILA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Gunfire and threats marred
last Monday's elections in five towns in the Philippines'
Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), the Manila Bulletin
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the firing of rifles, M-203 grenade
launchers and assorted weapons as well intimidation by
unidentified gunmen spoiled the elections in the five towns.
</P>
<P>
About 7,000 voters in the five towns were to cast their
ballots, together with some 90,000 voters in other areas, to
choose a governor and vice governor for the ARMM which was
composed of four provinces.
</P>
<P>
The Commission of Elections said that no election was held in
14 precincts in Madalum town due to the gunfire and threats while
the elections in other towns were canceled or delayed.
</P>
<P>
But it said the failure of elections in these towns did not
stop Moro National Liberation Front Chief Nur Misuari from being
elected governor of the ARMM since he was running unopposed.

<HEADLINE> New Name Reflects New Era for University </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Foreign students coming to
China to learn Chinese language and culture will find a new name
for the Beijing Language Institute -- the Beijing Language and
Culture University (BLCU), today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The institute received its new name yesterday in a ceremony to
mark Teachers' Day. The school, which specializes in teaching
foreign students Chinese language and culture, is the only of its
kind.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, BLCU President Yang Qinghua said the
university has made remarkable achievements in the past 34 years,
turning out 40,000 foreign students from 150 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The university is reforming its programs in an attempt to
improve teaching standards, scientific research and efficient
school management, Yang said. The changes are designed to improve
the university's overall strength and create a hub for teaching
Chinese as a foreign language and popularizing Chinese culture by
2000.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Yuanqing, deputy director of the State Education
Commission, encouraged the university to expand the education of
the Chinese and Chinese culture, and to improve overseas
co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1962 as the Higher Preparatory School for Foreign
Students, the school was renamed the Beijing Language Institute in
1964 by order of the late Premier Zhou Enlai.
</P>
<P>
Today, about 4,000 international students and 1,000 Chinese are
enrolled each year in the university.

<HEADLINE> China Launches Program to Create Agricultural Policy-Makers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- China's 12 agricultural
universities and research organizations are adopting a
co-operative education system as an effort to create more talented
agricultural policy-makers, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The co-operative program, LEAD 21, is managed by the US-based
Winrock International Institute for Agricultural Development, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
Mao Daru, president of China Agricultural University (CAU)
announced the new program on Monday at the welcome ceremony for
its doctoral-degree candidates.
</P>
<P>
In the past, China sent thousands of students abroad to study
agricultural business. The need for agribusiness specialists
became crucial as reform policies of the late 1970s took effect.
</P>
<P>
The 37 CAU doctoral students will remain in China this year,
thanks to the LEAD 21 Program, which boasts prestigious American
and European professors.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture praised the new approach, which
will arm students with international agribusiness acumen and
practical experience in China.
</P>
<P>
Participants are expected to become agricultural policy-makers
and instructors after completing the two-year program.
</P>
<P>
Currently, China has fewer than 10 agricultural economists in
its universities, government and research organizations.
</P>
<P>
The LEAD 21 Program, which stands for Leading Economic and
Agricultural Development into the 21st Century, also plans to set
up an agribusiness and policy research organization, as well as a
specialists network. The network aims to promote international
co-operation and exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Winrock International has worked with Asian countries for 25
years and has financial backing from the US Starr Foundation for
the LEAD 21 Program.

<HEADLINE> Possible IFC Co-operation With China In State-Owned Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) is willing to help China restructure its
state-owned enterprises, the organization's chief representative
in China says.
</P>
<P>
In a discussion at an investment and trade fair here Monday,
the company's Davin Mackenzie said that IFC's priority in China
includes helping develop limited recourse financing, attracting
world-class investors and technology to help develop
internationally competitive industries, and helping establish
non-state-owned commercial financial institutions to promote the
development of China's financial sector.
</P>
<P>
He also said that IFC will favor China's inland areas in
investment, and Sino-foreign joint ventures, joint stock companies
most of whose stock is not held by the State, and fairly large
rural and township enterprises with clear property rights.
</P>
<P>
China has been the fastest-growing economy in the world since
it launched its reform and opening-up drive, and the private
economy has since led all other sectors in growth, Mackenzie noted.
</P>
<P>
"The International Finance Corporation is very optimistic about
China's private enterprises," he said, adding that IFC is also
willing to assist China's new non-state-owned banks or to buy
their stock.
</P>
<P>
Since China became a member and shareholder of IFC in 1980, the
international financial body has invested a total of 900 million
US dollars in cement, glass, construction materials, chemicals,
and automobile production, as well as in farm-produce processing
and the capital market.
</P>
<P>
IFC was established in 1956 as a member of the World Bank
Group. Its China office was set up in 1992.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Deadlocked on Agricultural Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Senior economic officials of
ASEAN countries ended a two-day closed-door meeting last night
without agreement on the vital question of a time-frame for
liberalization of trade in agricultural products regarded as
"sensitive" such as rice and sugar.
</P>
<P>
The deadlock happened due to different perceptions among the
member countries on when they should begin progressively cutting
their tariffs on the goods to zero percent, according to Halida
Muljani, an Indonesian official who participated in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Some member countries proposed that liberalized trade in the
sensitive agricultural commodities should begin early in 2010. But
others, including Indonesia, maintained that 2010 should be the
year ASEAN countries begin the process of progressively reducing
their tariffs to attain zero percent only by 2020.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) groups Brunei,
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Muljani, who is director for multilateral trade at Indonesia's
Industry and Trade Ministry, said because of the impasse, the 28th
senior economic officials meeting for the ASEAN economic ministers
meeting decided to refer the problem for further discussion to a
meeting of ASEAN's AFTA (ASEAN Free Trade Area) Council due to
take place here on September 11.
</P>
<P>
"We agreed to have the problem further discussed at AFTA
Council level," Muljani said.
</P>
<P>
The 28th ASEAN economic ministers meeting will begin on
Thursday.

<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region, the country's largest cotton producer, is
expected to produce a record-high 1.05 million tons of cotton this
year.
</P>
<P>
According to an agriculture official in the remote Chinese
region, the output this year represents a growth of 12.5 percent
over last year and makes the region the first Chinese province to
turn out over one million tons of cotton.
</P>
<P>
While cotton production in the rest of China has been hit by
declining acreages, Xinjiang has unique weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, the region has been leading all the Chinese
provinces successively in cotton production. With the country's
decision to designate Xinjiang as the country's major commodity
cotton producer early last year, Xinjiang encouraged its cotton
growers to produce more.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Equality between the sexes
is growing in popularity in Shanghai, China's largest city, a new
survey has revealed.
</P>
<P>
Most young people want to select their spouses of their own
free will, with less than three percent obeying the advice of
their parents.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the traditional concept that women are mainly
responsible for household chores while men go to work, more than
60 percent of Shanghai couples now work and share household duties
together.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that 69 percent of couples think that their
marriage is based on love, while only 2 percent said they seldom
exchanged views with their spouses.
</P>
<P>
Some 40 percent of people quizzed think that parents should
educate children through heart-to-heart talks and by reasoning,
with only 2 percent insisting on beating as a way of teaching
children a lesson.
</P>
<P>
Spending on children is highest expense among Shanghai's
families, swallowing up 74 percent. Education of children attracts
the most attention of each family, and is the main cause for
disputes between parents.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the people surveyed expressed their
willingness to take care of their retired parents.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is preparing for
holding the Islamic Countries Women Solidarity Games in October
1997.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here Tuesday, Begum Shahnaz Wazir
Ali, the special assistant to Pakistani Pirme Minister Benazir
Bhutto, said that a total of 700 million rupees (about 20 million
US dollars) will be spent for the Games.
</P>
<P>

committee, said that 220 million rupees (about 6.1 million
dollars) will be spent on the replacement of electronic score
boards in the Jinnah Stadium and Liaquat Gymnasium in the Pakistan
Sports Complex.
</P>
<P>
However, she admitted that Pakistani women may not be able to
grab a large number of medals in the Games as it is for the first
time that they would be competing against some of the best
athletes in the world.
</P>
<P>
"But they will have their mark on the international sports
scene only if we provide them the opportunities," she added.
</P>
<P>
She was optimistic that Pakistani players would do well in
Hockey, Table Tennis and Squash.
</P>
<P>
The Director of National Institute of Sports and Culture, Zakir
Hussain Syed, said on the occasion that services of female coaches
have specially been hired from China and Russia to train Pakistani
women athletes.
</P>
<P>
To a question, he said the tartan track at the Jinnah Stadium
is fit to hold an international athletics meet and the technical
committee of the Games has given a go-ahead signal for the event.

<HEADLINE> 2.9 Million Voters to Cast Ballots at Bosnia Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 10 (Xinhua) -- A total of 2.9 million
voters have registered to cast their ballots in the first post-war
Bosnian general elections, spokesman for the regional center of
OSCE in Serb city Banja Luka, Thomas Miglierina, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Regarding election results, Miglierina said that the names of
those elected into the three-member presidency of
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the house of representative of
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the name of the president of Republika
Srpska, will be made public on September 17, according to Tanjug
news agency.
</P>
<P>
Official results at all levels will be made public by the
Provisional Election Commission of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in Sarajevo on September 24.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for the International Police Task Force (IPTF) Alan
Roberts, meanwhile, told reporters that the security of voters who
will be crossing lines between Republika Srpska and the
Muslim-Croat federation on September 14 will be controlled by IPTF,
the NATO-led peace Implementation Force (IFOR) and by members of
the Serb, Muslim and Croat police.
</P>
<P>
At the same day, Director General of the OSCE Joseph Fisher
said that any campaign activity both by candidates and by the
media in Bosnia-Herzegovina will be banned as of midnight
September 12.
</P>
<P>
Election-related advertising, "by any political party or
independent candidate, by any tv or radio station, paper or
magazine after midnight September 12 would be in violation of
Article 215 Part 1 of Rules and Regulations issued by the
Provisional Election Commission," Tanjug quoted Fisher as saying
in Banja Luka.
</P>
<P>
Under these rules, any registered political parties or
candidates will not be allowed to use, after midnight September 12,
the radio, television and papers with a view to promoting or
opposing a registered party, or with a view to electing a certain
candidate, Fisher added.

<HEADLINE> Frowick, Plavsic Meet over Upcoming Elections in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The head of the mission of
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) for
Bosnia Robert Frowick held talks with Bosnian Serb acting
President Biljana Plavsic Tuesday on the upcoming elections in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
They had discussed the postponed municipal elections and the
September 14 general elections for both entities -- Republika
Srpska and Muslim-Croat federation, and joint institutions, Tanjug
news agency said.
</P>
<P>
On September 14, citizens will elect central authorities in
Sarajevo, the leadership in the two entities and the parliament of
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The elections will be organized and monitored
by the Provisional Election committee of the OSCE.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting held in Serb largest city Banja Luka in
northwestern Bosnia, Frowick told reporters the meeting was
positive and constructive.
</P>
<P>
Plavsic also told reporters that both sides had agreed that
OSCE's activities in Bosnia should continue until the local
elections which will be held most probably before the end of the
year. The municipal elections was postponed by the OSCE till later
this year or next April because OSCE found manipulation of refugee
registrations in Serb territories.
</P>
<P>
She said that OSCE's presence in the elections would be useful
because its teams had acquired precious experience in the field.
</P>
<P>
"We agreed on the need for all of us to work in order to
preserve a truly tolerant and correct atmosphere for the upcoming
elections," Plavsic added.

<HEADLINE> UN General Assembly Approves Nuclear Test Ban Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. General
Assembly (GA) approved on Tuesday the nuclear test ban treaty,
that failed to gain consensus in the Geneva-based Conference on
Disarmament last month.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, known as the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT),
once coming into force, will ban all signatory countries from
conducting any nuclear tests. But it does not come into force
until 44 states with a nuclear potential sign and ratify it.
</P>
<P>
The result of the Assembly voting is 158 for, three against and
five abstentions. Bhutan, India and Libya voted against. Lebanon,
Syria, Tanzania, Mauritius and Cuba abstained.
</P>
<P>
Under the adopted resolution, the General Assembly approved the
nuclear test ban treaty and requested the U.N. Secretary-General
to arrange open signature of the treaty, which is expected on
September 24.
</P>
<P>
The Assembly also called upon all countries to sign and ratify
the treaty as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Among the states which cast negative and abstention votes, only
India is included in the 44 countries with nuclear potential. It
exploded a nuclear device in 1974 and hence declared that it would
not give up nuclear option until all nuclear powers are committed
to destroying their nuclear weapons in a limited time frame.
</P>
<P>
In a statement made after the voting, Ambassador Sha Zukang of
China welcomed the outcome.
</P>
<P>
The resolution "represents the result of the two and a half
years of negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament and by and
large reflects the realistic state of negotiations and therefore
is balanced in general," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that the current practice of so-called
"bypassing" the Conference on Disarmament shall not constitute any
precedent for the work of the Conference.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese delegation regrets that the Conference on
Disarmament was not able to adopt the CTBT text by consensus and
to transmit it to the U.N. General Assembly," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The current rule of consensus of the Conference on Disarmament
is not merely a procedural arrangement. It is an important
guarantee that no security interests of any group or state will be
jeopardized," he added.
</P>
<P>
After two and a half year's negotiations, the 61-nation
Geneva-based Conference on Disarmament put forward a last
version the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. But India refused to
approve and transmit it to the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
To save the treaty, Australia sought to put it into voting in
the General Assembly, which unlike the Conference on Disarmament
requests consensus. It only needs a majority vote to approve the
treaty.

<HEADLINE> EU Legislation Adequate for Asbestos Prevention: EC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
has recently said that existing EU legislation remains adequate
for protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to
asbestos at work, it was learned here today.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release given here Tuesday, the Commission
considers that the legislation does not need to be changed unless
it is decided, at EU level, to extend the prohibition of the use
of asbestos.
</P>
<P>
Asbestos is a particularly hazardous agent which can cause
serious illness in various forms and in a large number of
circumstances at work.
</P>
<P>
To combat these dangers, the European Council adopted in
September 1983 Directive 83/477/EEC on the protection of workers
from the risks related to exposure to asbestos at work. It was
subsequently updated and amended by other directives adopted later
on.
</P>
<P>
The directive requires that each employer assess the risk in
the case of any activity likely to involve the risk of exposure to
asbestos.

<HEADLINE> UK Vows to Fight Spanish Fishing Compensation Claim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- A senior British government
minister said here today that his country would fight a
multi-million pound compensation claim made by Spanish fishermen
as there was no case for the Spanish fishermen to be made.
</P>
<P>
Spanish fishermen are launching claims for an estimated 80
million pounds (about 124 million U.S. dollars) compensation in
the English High Court following a ruling in their favor by the
European Court of Justice.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in March, the European Court of Justice ruled that
British laws which restricted foreign-owned fishing vessels from
fishing in British waters breached European law.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a BBC television interview, British Fisheries
Minister Tony Baldry said, "we do not see any case being made here
for damages."
</P>
<P>
Baldry noted that the British government was seeking
far-reaching changes to the European Union (EU) treaty to end
"quota hopping", which enables foreign vessels to register in
Britain and take some parts of Britain's national catch quota.
</P>
<P>
"What this does demonstrate is the crazy situation that has
arisen in relation to quota hoppers, whereby, in effect, Spanish
owned, crewed and skippered boats can come and fish as against the
UK national fishing quota," Baldry said.
</P>
<P>
The government minister stressed," we can not have a situation
whereby UK fish are being taken by anyone other than UK fishermen.
That's just crazy and the sooner the quota hoppers are eliminated
the better."
</P>
<P>
Judges in the English High Court decided earlier today to hold
 pre-trial review of the case in February next year followed by a
full hearing in June or July.

<HEADLINE> New York Stocks Retreat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street moved
lower a bit today after struggling rising interest rates in the
bond market and some profit-taking on a two-day rally.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 6.66 to 5,727.18 after
rallying for two days.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a slim margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, with volume totaling 371.68 million
shares, up from 310.88 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index rose 0.21 to 356.49, and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.06 to 663.82.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 0.72 to 1,149.43, and the
American Stock Exchange's market value index rose 3.27 to 565.23.
</P>
<P>
Dow's 2.2 percent advance on Friday and Monday had put the
barometer of 30 big U.S. companies within 45 points of its
all-time high at 5,778.00, set in late May.
</P>
<P>
Broader measures turned mostly higher by the close, but trading
was somewhat directionless as investors grew cautious before some
key readings on inflation due later this week.
</P>
<P>
Stocks were pressured throughout the day by the bond market,
where prices fell after two strong sessions, sending the yield on
the 30-year Treasury bond to 7.12 percent, up from late Monday's
7.06 percent.
</P>
<P>
There was little reaction to this morning's report that
workplace productivity rose at a 0.5 percent annual rate in the
April-June quarter. That was a much better performance than
expected, but down from a much stronger 1.8 percent advance during
the January-March quarter. Greater efficiency means businesses can
increase wages without raising prices.
</P>
<P>
Although Federal Reserve officials is looking for clues on
whether inflation is accelerating, investors were more concerned
with the Thursday's and Friday's reports on wholesale and retail
inflation during August.

<HEADLINE> U.S. 1977 Military Spending Bill Passed in Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate today
approved the U.S. defense spending bill for the 1997 fiscal year
that begins on October 1.
</P>
<P>
The 265.6 billion U.S. dollars bill, passed 73-26, continues
the Republican agenda of adding money beyond U.S. President Bill
Clinton's request for weapons, particularly fighting planes and
missile defense systems.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which the U.S. House of representatives passed on
August 1, would also give a three percent pay raise to some 1.5
million American men and women soldiers.
</P>
<P>
While the bill covers the fiscal year beginning next month, the
pay raise kicks in the first of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Under the legislation, U.S. military spending would increase
slightly 1.3 billion U.S. dollars over the current fiscal year
which ends at the end of this month. But the measure adds 11.2
billion U.S. dollars to what Clinton has requested for the
military spending in the next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
White House officials have indicated that the pay increase is a
key reson the president is willing to sign the defense
authorization bill despite reservations about its overall spending
level.
</P>
<P>
Three-fourths of the additional 11.2 billion U.S. dollars would
go toward advanced weapons purchases and research.
</P>
<P>
Among the key systems financed in the bill are 2.2 billion U.S.
dollars for the first 12 production models of the enhanced Navy
FA-18 fighter, a 2 billion U.S. dollars for continued development
of the U.S. Air Force F-22 air superiority fighter, 602 million
U.S. dollars for development of a joint-strike fighter that would
serve the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marines.

<HEADLINE> UK Manufacturing Input, Output Prices Continue to Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Inflationary pressures at the
production end of British economy fell to the lowest levels for
almost 30 years last month, boosting government hopes of keeping
prices subdued in the run-up to the general election.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released today by the Office for National
Statistics (ONS), producer input prices rose by only 0.3 percent
in August and left input prices down 2.2 percent from a year ago,
slightly less than the 2.3 percent year-on-year drop in July.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that a rise in the price of crude oil caused by
renewed tension in the Gulf was more than offset by falling prices
for metals, chemicals and other imported materials.
</P>
<P>
Output price inflation fell for the eighth consecutive month in
August, from July's 2.2 percent to 2.0 percent, the lowest rate
since July 1994.
</P>
<P>
Underlying output price inflation, which excludes more volatile
food, drinks, tobacco and petroleum prices, fell to 1.2 percent,
the lowest level since 1967.
</P>
<P>
City economists believe that the figures suggest the underlying
inflation rate should fall into the government's target range of
2.5 percent or less over the next few months.
</P>
<P>
The figures also fuelled speculation that Kenneth Clarke, the
Chancellor, might yet push for another interest rate cut before
the general election due next spring.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Urges Int'l Community to Aid Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 10 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali today urged the international community to
overcome "Africa fatigue" and increase trade, finance, information
and technological flows to the continent.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Business Council for the United Nations,
Boutros-Ghali said that Africa's difficulties in dealing with a
heavy historical heritage are shared by other countries on other
continents. But the magnitude of Africa's problems is such that
Africa deserves particular attention from the world community.
</P>
<P>
"Today, most of the conflicts in which the United Nations is
involved take place in Africa. Some of the bloodiest civil wars
have been fought on African soil. The majority of the world's
refugees and displaced persons is in Africa. And the majority of
the world's least developed countries are African countries," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Africans will be the instruments of their salvation. But the
international community must be present to accompany these
efforts," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He noted there is a grave danger today:"Africa fatigue."
Governments are faced daily with competing domestic issues and
political pressures. It is an easy path from fatigue to despair,
from despair to indifference and neglect.
</P>
<P>
"This is why I have sought to lead the United Nations in
efforts to arrest, and to reverse the marginalization of Africa,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations embarked upon a new Agenda for the
Development of Africa in the 1990s. It launched a Special
Initiative on Africa last year to bring together the expertise and
the resources of all parts of the UN system in helping African
countries achieve their aims, he said.
</P>
<P>
While the United Nations is leading efforts to reverse "Africa
fatigue," it cannot do everything. Trade, finance, information and
technological flows, these will help Africa its rightful place.
The contribution of the business community to African development
will be crucial, as Africans proceed on their march to political
stability, and economic empowerment, he said.

<HEADLINE> UK Likely to Host Summit of EX-Yugoslav Republic Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The British government is
planning to host a summit of the former Yugoslav republic leaders
in London later this year in an effort to give a fresh impetus to
the peace process in the region, according to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
The summit meeting, which is very much likely to be held in
early December, is expected to be formally announced later next
month when the British Parliament returns from its summer recess.
</P>
<P>
The two-day gathering, which will be seen as Dayton Two, will
seek fresh commitments to peace from Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic, Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic and Croatian
President Franco Tudjman, according to diplomatic sources.
</P>
<P>
The London summit is not supposed to produce another peace
treaty, but is aimed at getting the main protagonists to stick to
their commitments, they added.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts say that the summit meeting will probably take
place after a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in the first week
of December, at which the NATO allies are expected to agree that
some troops should remain in Bosnia next year to reinforce the
peace process.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Minister Bashes Western Media for Biased </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Minister for
Information and Broadcasting, Johnstone Makau, today criticized
the western media for their biased and unfair reports on Africa.
</P>
<P>
Many African news broadcasted by western news agencies are
"negative and biased," said the minister, adding that the western
media is keen on reporting the disasters, wars and famine in the
continent.
</P>
<P>
Makau made the remarks here when meeting Xia Zanzhong,
Vice-President of Xinhua News Agency, who is on an inspection
tour to Xinhua's African Regional Bureau based in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
He said western news agencies on many occasions neglected the
positive developments in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Kenyan minister spoke highly of Xinhua's new
coverage on Africa, describing it as "impartial and objective."
</P>
<P>
Xia briefed the minister on the progress Xinhua has made over
the past years in building itself into a world news agency.

<HEADLINE> Banana Exporters Fear Loss of EU Preferential Provisions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Banana-producing Caribbean
countries warned Monday their economies would be devastated if the
World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled against the European Union's
preferential banana import regime.
</P>
<P>
The Journal of Commerce reported today that a WTO dispute panel
is set to begin hearings here today on a joint complaint by the
United States, Guatemala, Honduras, Equador, and Mexico that the
EU's banana import regime is discriminatory and contrary to agreed
global rules.
</P>
<P>
The special EU provisions allow Caribbean growers to receive on
average return of 8 to 10 U.S. dollars per 18.4 kilogram box.
</P>
<P>
"For the Caribbean it is life and death that these (EU)
provisions are maintained," an official with the Caribbean Banana
Exporters Association, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to estimates by the banana exporters group, the
Caribbean accounts for 3 percent of world banana exports with all
its shipments going to the EU. Caribbean exporters have a 7
percent share of the EU market. For St. Lucia, St. Vincent and
Dominica, banana exports to the EU account for between 50 percent
to 60 percent of all their export earnings.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Monitoring Iraqi Rebuilding of Damaged Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- the United States is
monitoring Iraq's military activity in the south of rebuilding air
defense installations damaged in last week's U.S. missile strikes,
U.S. officials said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are watching very carefully," Leon Panetta, the White House
chief of staff, said.
</P>
<P>
New radar units have been attached to the surface-to-air
missiles and the systems may again be able to constitute a threat
to allied aircraft, said a defense official familiar with the
details of Iraq's military.
</P>
<P>
"We're looking at three or four SAM sites that have been what I
would call reconstituted since the attack," said the defense
official. "They've put new radars with them... The working
assumption in the site is operational."
</P>
<P>
The United States has warned that any moves of reconstruction
of the damaged air defense sites, damaged by 44 U.S. cruise
missiles in two strikes a week ago, would prompt follow-up
strikes.
</P>
<P>
"We have warned Saddam Hussein that any attempt to repair those
sites or reinforce them will be taken very seriously, and he must
understand the consequences of such an act," Gen. John
Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said last
weekend.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Iraqis, knowing operating air defense
radars exposes the systems to immediate attack by radar-seeking
air-to-ground missiles fired by allied aircraft, have been careful
not to turn on the systems, making it difficult for the Pentagon
to assess what is up and running. But intelligence gathered by the
Pentagon indicates the Iraqis have already put damaged sites back
into operation.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi systems fire Russian-made SA-2 and SA-3 missiles in
fixed batteries, intended for use against planes flying at low
and medium altitudes but capable against higher-flying aircraft.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Namibian President Sam
Nujoma today assured his people that the food supply for the
country is "enough in the short and medium terms at the national
level."
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that at household and individual
levels, Namibia faces a high degree of food insecurity in parts
of the southern African nation, according to a report from the
southern Afrian Broadcasting Association.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma said the situation is due to the lack of access to food
because of poverty and low levels of food self-reliance by some
farming communities.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian president said the elimination of hunger and
malnutrition is the fundamental challenge facing the southern
African country today.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Nujoma declared an emergency in Namibia due
to the continuing drought in many parts of the country.

<HEADLINE> Gambia's Jammeh Bans Some Politicians From Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Gambian Head of State Yaya
Jammeh today announced a ban on some politicians from running for
the presidential elections scheduled for September 26.
</P>
<P>
"The exclusion is aimed at sanitizing the policy," Gambian
Ambassador to Nigeria Maha Job said today, explaining that the
politicians had been involved in fraudulent activities in the
past.
</P>
<P>
"Most of them are found guilty of embezzlement of public funds
by enquiry teams set up by the government," said Job.
</P>
<P>
The Gambian government has seized some of the assets of these
politicians based on the conclusions by reputable judges from
Ghana and Sierra Leone, said the envoy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jammeh himself is set to run for the next civilian
president of the West African country.
</P>
<P>
Defending Jammeh's decision to contest, the Gambian envoy said
by resigning from the army, Jammeh has established "a level
playing field" for the four presidential aspirants.
</P>
<P>
"As a citizen, he is entitled under the constitution to
contest for the highest office in the country," said the envoy.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Two Major Parties in Greece Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The September 22 elections in
Greece could be a cliffhanger with the ruling Panhellenic
Socialist Movement (PASOK) and the main opposition party New
Democracy running neck and neck as the election campaign enters
its final two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The first nationwide campaign polls show the New Democracy, led
by its leader Miliadis Evert, in striking distance of an upset
victory, largely because of the surprising strength of several
smaller leftwing parties.
</P>
<P>
According to an opinion poll conducted for the influential
private Mega television, PASOK trails New Democracy by almost half
a percentage point while another survey conducted by the liberal
daily Ta Nea (The News) shows PASOK ahead by slightly less than
one percentage point.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the first poll puts New Democracy ahead with 31
percent, compared to 30.6 percent for PASOK party. The second poll
shows PASOK ahead with 32.8 percent, compared with New Democracy's
31.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Undecided voters in both surveys averaged around 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
The PASOK government, led by Prime Minister Costas Simitis,
declared last month Snap elections one year before the end of its
four-year term, citing the urgent national and economic issues as
the reason.
</P>
<P>
Local observers noted that strong showing of the small parties
in the campaign might rob the two major parties of an absolute
majority, leading to a possible coalition government after the
September 22 elections.
</P>
<P>
Splinter parties on both PASOK and New Democracy are expected
to siphon off support from the two major parties which are
challenged respectively by newly formed Democratic Socialist
Movement (DIKKI) and Political Spring Party led by former New
Democracy government Foreign Minister Antonis Samaras.
</P>
<P>
DIKKI, formed by Dimitris Tsovolas, a populist politician who
had served as finance minister during PASOK government in the
eighties, is expected to gain 5 to 6 percent in the forthcoming
elections and Political Spring with some 3 to 4 percent, the two
opinion polls show.
</P>
<P>
Another two parties, the Communists Party of Greece (KKE) and
the Coalition of the Left (Synaspismos) are expected to get some 4
and 5 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, the key to the September 22 elections is still held by
the undecided voters. Many analysts agree that friday's televised
debate between Simitis and Evert will probably be the most
catalytic factor in determining which way they will swing.

<HEADLINE> European Stocks' Rally Undermined by A Weak Wall Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Leading European stock markets
all surged strongly Tuesday on the back of Monday's rally on Wall
Street, with London hitting a new peak, but a weak Wall Street
start today later undermined the rallies.
</P>
<P>
British shares had climbed more than 20 points on the FTSE 100
index in morning trade, supported by the overnight surge on the
Dow, but failed to maintain record gains as the market tracked a
pullback on Wall Street and fell back sharply in later trading to
close only up 5.3 points.
</P>
<P>
However, traders said the market's outlook remained bullish
given recent evidence of strong consumer demand in Britain.
</P>
<P>
In Germany, the Frankfurt market also ended the session higher,
propelled by Wall Street's 74-points surge on Monday, the dollar's
persistent strength and firmer government bonds, with the DAX-30
index up 22.22 points.
</P>
<P>
The Paris bourse started firmer and extended its early gains,
driven by similar forces, plus gains in the French franc. The
French shares finished just off the day's high, up 1.08 percent on
the CAC-40 index.
</P>
<P>
London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading
British shares closed 5.3 points higher at 3,916.1. The Frankfurt
DAX-30 index ended up 22.22 at 2,570.95. The Paris CAC-40 share
index finished up 21.82 at 2,042.12.

the anticipated reunification with Hong Kong in 1997.
</P>
<P>
On his part, the Chinese state councillor pledged the
commitment of the Chinese government to strengthen the existing
political and economic relations with Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
"The Sino-Tanzania relationship should be all weather and all
directional," said Luo, quoting the pledge by Chinese President
Jiang Zemin who concluded a six-nation African trip three months ago.
</P>
<P>
Luo pointed out that the Chinese people would never forget the
role played by Tanzania in the struggle to make China regain its
seat at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
And at present, with China's growing economic power, the
chances for its assistance to Tanzania have been greatly
enhanced, said Luo.
</P>

National Assembly, Pius Msekwa, also had friendly talks with the
Chinese councillor.
