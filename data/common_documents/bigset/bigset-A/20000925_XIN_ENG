<HEADLINE> U.S. Shows Sympathy for Bangladesh on GSP Issue: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I could see the impact of this on senior officials during my
discussions in Washington," said State Minister for Foreign
Affairs Abul Hasan Chowdhury who returned from Washington after
his meeting with U.S. leaders and senior officials on bilateral
matters and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's upcoming visit to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Hasina made a request to U.S. President Bill Clinton about
Bangladesh's GSP facilities during a meeting at the United Nations
Millennium Summit in New York.
</P>
<P>
On the meeting between the Bangladeshi delegation and the GSP
Subcommittee Chairman John Rosenbaum of U.S. Trade Representative
Office, the state minister said, they had a long and constructive
discussion on the issue, which was followed by a meeting with
Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Susan G. Esserman.
</P>
<P>
"I'm hopeful of a resolution of this issue which will not be
detrimental to us," he said, adding that both sides will now be
required to come up with a creative formulation.
</P>
<P>
Under the pressure of American Federation of Labor and Congress
for Industrial Organization, the U.S. government has threatened to
cancel the GSP facilities provided to Bangladesh who refused to
allow trade union activities in its export processing zones (EPZs).
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government has already taken an initiative to
form Workers' Welfare Association in the EPZs instead of allowing
trade union. It is also trying hard to make the U.S. government
understand that the proposed welfare association will protect
workers' rights in the EPZs.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Foreign Minister Abdul
Sattar has denied making the comment that the Bangladesh prime
minister's statement denouncing military rule at the United
Nations Security Council was made under foreign prompting or
influence, according to the United News of Bangladesh Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The report was false and baseless," he said in a letter to
Foreign Minister of Bangladesh Abdus Samad Azad, refuting the
report published in the local newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistan foreign minister said: "I am sorry to learn that
at her press conference on September 12, Her Excellence the prime
minister of Bangladesh commented on a report ascribing me a remark
I did not make."
</P>
<P>
"I have too much respect for Bangladesh and for the leaders of
Bangladesh to even think of such a thought," said the Pakistan
foreign minister clarifying his position to his Bangladesh
counterpart.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in her speech at the United
Nations Security Council on September 7 suggested that the world
community should not recognize any regime who assumes power by
overthrowing elected constitutional government. She urged the
United Nations to take action to that effect.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan Chief Executive Gen. Pervez Musharraf did not turn up
at the scheduled meeting with Sheikh Hasina in New York on
September 8.
</P>
<P>
Talking to newsmen Sunday, State Minister for Foreign Affairs
Abul Hasan Chowdhury said Bangladesh would continue its efforts to
bring about a reduction in tensions in South Asia.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Boxing Team Wiped Out in Sydney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine boxing team was
wiped out of the Sydney Olympics after flyweight Arlan Lerio
suffered his defeat Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time in many years that the Philippine boxing
team was beaten in the second round, according to the Philippine
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Lerio was defeated 79-80 in his battle against
Poland's Andrzej Rzany.
</P>
<P>
The country's lightweight Larry Semillano and light-welter
Romeo Brin both lost in the first round while Lerio's younger
brother, light fly Danilo, fell in the second round after drawing
a bye in the first round.
</P>
<P>
Philippines' Boxing Association President Manny Lopez accepted
full responsiblity for his boys' unexpected early exit, saying "as
soon as we get home to Manila, we'll review our program."
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud of my boys for giving their best here. They
sacrificed a lot," Lopez said.
</P>
<P>
Expections had run high in the Philippines that their boxers
could bring home at least one medal from Sydney as the country's
highest hope falls on boxing, in which the Filipinos take pride.
</P>
<P>
Since the Philippines participated in the eighth Olympics in
Paris in 1924, Filipinos have captured two silver and seven bronze
medals, but never had a chance of kissing a gold.

<HEADLINE> Single Currency for West Africa to be Determined by Economic Strength </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The future common currency of
the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) will be
determined by economic strength of its member states, Nigerian
Minister of Cooperation and Integration in Africa Dapo Sarumi has
said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a media forum in the capital Abuja at the weekend,
Sarumi said a strong economy in the sub-region would dictate what
the effective currency would be adopted as the common currency in
West Africa.
</P>
<P>
Sarumi noted that a strong and solid Nigerian economy would be
the currency of choice in the sub-region, adding that Nigeria has
the potential to be one of the strongest economies in West Africa
and in Africa as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Leaders from the 16-member ECOWAS last year agreed to create a
new monetary zone in the sub-region by the year 2003 and to adopt
the single common currency by the year 2004.
</P>
<P>
However, Mauritania, the 16th member state of the ECOWAS,
indicated that it would withdraw from the organization as the
launching of a common currency in the sub-region was not in its
interest.

<HEADLINE> Ben-Ami, Abdullah Say Peace Process in Crucial Moment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli acting Foreign Minister
Shlomo Ben-Ami and Jordanian King Abdullah II agreed here Monday
that the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks were now in a decisive
moment and time was running short for the two sides to seal a peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after his meeting with Abdullah, Ben-Ami
said "In fact we are facing what can be defined as the last shot of
the peace process," adding that "We don't have an excess of time."
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami said it was time that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat make tough decisions.
</P>
<P>
He said a meeting between Barak and Arafat to push forward the
peace process "will definitely take place," but he could not
provide a date for the event.
</P>
<P>
Another official said Abdullah called for increased efforts by
all concerned parties, particularly the United States, to push
forward the peace process towards "a comprehensive and fair
settlement based on international legislation."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli minister arrived in Amman after a lightening visit
to Egypt where he met with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa separately over the Israeli-Palestinian
peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami said in Cairo that Israel would consider a partial
agreement if a comprehensive deal in out of reach, adding however
that this question is not on the agenda at this moment when all
parties are trying to exhaust the possibilities to reach an
agreement on all pending issues.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Jordan are the only two Arab countries to have signed
peace agreements with Israel. Both countries act as major mediators
in the Middle East peace process.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Has No Intention to Invade Kuwait: Senior Official EDS-1st lead-writethru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 25 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iraqi official said
here Monday evening that Iraq has no intention to take military
actions against Kuwait or any other country.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time the Iraqi government made such an
announcement, amid rising tension between Iraq and Kuwait in recent
days due to what Kuwait accused as Baghdad's threat of invasion.
</P>
<P>
Iraq does not want to seek enmity with any country except the
Zionism (Israel), which occupies the land of Palestine, said Iraqi
Minister of Culture and Information Humam Abd Al-Khaliq Abd Al-
Ghafur in a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The statement seemed intended to soften the effect of a speech
made by President Saddam Hussein in which he accused Saudi Arabia
and Kuwait of committing a "crime" by allowing the United States
and Britain to use military bases in their territories to "kill
Iraqi people and destroy their houses."
</P>
<P>
The president was just speaking the facts, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait allow the U.S. and Britain to use their
bases to monitor the southern no-fly zone in Iraq, imposed by the
Western allies after the 1991 Gulf War triggered by Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led allies also use a base in Turkey to monitor another
no-fly zone in northern Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Resignation of Pro-reform Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Iran's presidential office on
Monday denied reports that pro-reform Minister of Culture and
Islamic Guidance Ataollah Mohajerani has resigned.
</P>
<P>
The minister, a close ally of reform-minded President Mohammad
Khatami, has resigned and his resignation has been accepted by the
president, the conservative-controlled Islamic Republic of Iran
Broadcasting (IRIB) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
But a spokesman of the public relations department of the
presidential office categorically denied the "rumors," saying
Khatami has not been informed of such a resignation at all, the
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman urged the mass media to contact the presidential
office's public relations department before spreading news related
to this office.
</P>
<P>
He added that the IRIB had broadcast the news without checking
the issue with the presidential office.
</P>
<P>
Due to his encouragement of press freedom, Mohajerani has been
under strong criticism from the conservatives.
</P>
<P>
Although the conservatives have lost control of the executive
and legislative establishments as a result of general elections,
they still dominate such powerful organs as the judiciary and the
military and enjoy support from supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
In the past few months, the judiciary shut down over 20
reformist dailies and periodicals and imprisoned a number of
journalists on charges of violating Islamic principles.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives have also increased their pressure, trying to
force Mohajerani to resign from his post in charge of activities of
the press.
</P>
<P>
But the minister had said he has no intention to quit the post.

<HEADLINE> Barak, Arafat Begin First Meeting Since Camp David </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat have begun their meeting
near Tel Aviv a short while ago, a source close to the negotiation
said Monday night.
</P>
<P>
This was the two leader's first meeting since the Camp David
summit in July, during which the two leaders, along with U.S.
President Bill Clinton, failed to reach any agreement for a final
peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians. The peace process
has been in deadlock since then.
</P>
<P>
Israeli acting Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami and Barak's top
aide Danny Yatom also reportedly attended the meeting, as did
Palestinian Legislative Council Speaker Ahmed Qurei (Abu Ala) and
Arafat's political adviser Nabil Abu Rudaineh.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders were expected to build mutual-confidence and
narrow their gaps over core issues, especially the fate of
Jerusalem and the return of Palestinian refugees, during the
summit.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials said before the meeting that Barak will
evaluate whether Arafat has showed more flexibility on ideas that
were raised both during the Camp David summit and afterwards.

<HEADLINE> Globalization Should Benefit All, Says World Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Development Committee of
the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Monday
stressed that globalization should work for the benefit of all,
and not just a few.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued here after the 62nd meeting of the
Development Committee said the more integrated global economy and
technological gains brought about by globalization should be a
great source for economic and social progress, equity and
stability.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the committee reemphasized its commitment to
strengthening the World Bank, the IMF and other multilateral
institutions as valuable allies in this effort to reduce global
poverty, in particular halving the proportion of extreme poverty
by the year 2015.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank will be involved in four areas: facilitate
international movement of goods, services and factors of
production, foster broad inclusion in the benefits of
globalization and mitigate major economic and social problems,
preserve and protect the environment, and create and share
knowledge relevant to development.
</P>
<P>
On strengthening international financial architecture, the
communique noted that the World Bank, together with the IMF and
other international agencies, should help develop appropriate
standards and codes, taking account of the developing country
perspective as well as assisting countries to strengthen their
related institutions and policies.
</P>
<P>
It also pointed to the importance for all nations to increase
national and international efforts to combat cross-border
financial abuse, such as money-laundering and other forms of abuse.

ATHENS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- No problem has arisen in the
Yugoslav elections held Sunday, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said Monday.
</P>

In addition, former Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias is

President Slobodan Milosevic in order to exert pressure on him to
accept any election result.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Warring Parties in Afghanistan Urged to Stop Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council on Monday reiterated its call on warring factions in
Afghanistan to stop fighting and resume negotiations under the U.N.
auspices without further delay or any preconditions.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member council appealed to all Afghan parties to work
together for peace and the establishment of a broad-based,
multiethnic and fully representative government, according to a
presidential statement released after closed-door consultations of
the council.
</P>
<P>
Council members recalled their readiness to consider the
imposition of further measures against fundamentalist Taliban
militia to achieve a full implementation of council resolutions,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The council heard a briefing by Frances Vendrell, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's personal representative. Vendrell
said both the Security Council and group of "6 + 2" have asked him
to report back by the beginning of November on the willingness of
the warring parties to achieve a cease-fire and to enter into
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He said he will bring these messages to the representatives of
Taliban and the United Front next week before the council draws
its conclusions.
</P>
<P>
Some of the council members have inclined to strengthen the
sanctions, but this is not the view of all council members, he
said, expecting further cooperation by the "6 + 2" group which
comprises six neighbors of Afghanistan plus Russia and the United
States.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Vice President Heads for OPEC Summit Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Vice President Taha
Yassin Ramadan left here Monday for the Venezuelan capital of
Caracas to attend the summit meeting of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) scheduled from September 28-
30.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Ramadan said that Iraq, where OPEC was founded,
is keen to attend the summit meeting in order to keep the unity of
the world's largest oil cartel.
</P>
<P>
OPEC should also be free from outside pressure which come mainly
from the United States-led Western countries, Ramadan said.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan said that during the meeting, he will focus on "the
wrong actions taken by some members" to increase oil production,
the official Iraqi News Agency (INA) quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan headed an Iraqi delegation that included Foreign
Minister Mohammad Said Al-Sahaf and Oil Minister Amir Muhammad
Rashid.
</P>
<P>
Though not linked directly to the OPEC quota system because of
the harsh U.N. sanctions imposed since its invasion of Kuwait in
1990, Iraq has vehemently opposed OPEC's pumping of more oil under
pressure from the West.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan said he believed his visit will serve as "a good chance"
to boost bilateral relations between Iraq and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
Ties between the two countries have witnessed a big step forward
after Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez visited Baghdad on August
10, the first by a foreign head of state since the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela and Iraq are both sponsor nations of OPEC. On
September 10, 1960, representatives from Iraq, Venezuela, Iran,
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait held a meeting in Baghdad to safeguard the
oil prices. Four days later, they announced the founding of OPEC.

<HEADLINE> Israel Keeping Eye on Syrian Missile Development: Barak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak said Monday that he is worried by reports that Syria has
successfully tested a long-range Scud-D ground-to-ground missile
over the weekend and that Israel is watching closely the
development.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on media reports that the Scud-D which Syria
recently acquired would not necessarily be intercepted by Israel's
Arrow anti-ballistic missile.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after an Israeli Defense Forces (IDF)
ceremony, Barak called it "a development that effectively puts all
Israel in the range of Syrian missiles. So, in this way, it is a
negative development."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said Israel is continuing to follow the
situation and prepare for all possibilities.
</P>
<P>
He added that the IDF's strength made it possible for Israel to
discuss peace with its neighbors, including Syria.
</P>
<P>
Although reports of the test appeared on several Israeli
newspapers, Syria has reportedly made no comment on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Israeli Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh said that
Syria's developing military might is strengthening its offensive
capabilities but that is not contradictory to Damascus's
willingness to reach an agreement with Israel under certain terms.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian peace negotiations which resumed last
December broke off in March when Israel refused to promise a full
return of the strategic Golan Heights captured in the 1967 Middle
East Six-Day War.
</P>
<P>
Israel officially declared in March its newly developed Arrow-2
anti-ballistic missile defense system operational, rendering Israel
the first country in the world to have the capacity to defend
itself against ballistic missile attacks.
</P>
<P>
In a test earlier this month, the Arrow-2 missile system
successfully hit a live, incoming target of "Scud" missile fired
from the Mediterranean Sea in a simulated enemy attack for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
The system is designed to deal with Scud and Scud-derived
ballistic missiles in the arsenals of Syria, Iran and Iraq. Its
first battalion was deployed in central Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel's leading daily Ha'aretz said on Monday that the
difficulty the Scud-D, which has a maximum range of 600 kilometers,
longer than earlier Scud B and C models, would pose for the IDF
lies in trying to locate the missile launchers.
</P>
<P>
Extending the range enables the Syrian military to locate
launchers deep inside their territory and operate them at a far
greater distance than with previous short-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Air Force (IAF) commanders have called for equipping the
air force with a sufficient number of advanced war planes to act
against the launchers of ground-to-ground missiles of short, medium
and long ranges.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the warplanes, Barak approved 10 days ago the
purchase of other equipment to bolster the IAF's deterrent and
strike capability deep inside enemy territory, said the paper.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's New Lawmakers Receive Death Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Eight members of the newly
elected parliament have been threatened with assassination if
alleged Sunni fundamentalists are not released from custody, the
official NNA news agency reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The threat was circulated in a pamphlet in the city of Tripoli,
75 kilometers north of Beirut, at the weekend. It demanded that the
prisoners, held in connection with last January's Dinnieh clashes,
be released within 10 days. It was signed by al-Takfir wal-Hijra,
or "Repentance and Migration."
</P>
<P>
A militant Islamic group which gained notoriety in Egypt in the
1970s called itself al-Takfir wal-Hijra. Its leader and several
members were executed in 1978 after killing a cleric.
</P>
<P>
Security officials, who refused to be identified, said that they
suspected the group's name was being used merely to hide the
identity of the true source of the pamphlet. "We are trying to find
out if this is a prank or a serious threat."
</P>
<P>
The group's name resurfaces from time to time, arousing
skepticism of any real links to the extremist group, which had a
strong reputation for carrying out assassinations.
</P>
<P>
Al-Takfir wal-Hijra was blamed for four days of clashes between
the army and Sunni Islamists in Dinnieh, a region near Tripoli,
from New Year's Eve to January 3.
</P>
<P>
The clashes claimed the lives of 11 servicemen, three civilians
and at least 20 rebels. The Islamists were reportedly planning
attacks on tourist resorts during millennium celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-seven suspects are being held in custody in connection
with the clashes. Eight others were released on bail and 29 others,
including a Saudi, a Kuwaiti and two Libyans, are still being
tracked down.
</P>
<P>
All the suspects are due to be tried at the Judicial Council,
the highest court in the country, which issues sentences that
cannot be appealed and which looks into cases threatening national
security.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of suspects face the death penalty if found guilty of
planning and taking part in the clashes.

<HEADLINE> Iran against International Intervention in Caspian Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Ministry said on
Monday that Tehran is opposed to any international intervention in
the Caspian Sea issue, which instead should be solved among
littoral states.
</P>
<P>
Without the consent of all the littoral states, it is impossible
to refer the issue to the United Nations or other international
organizations, an informed source at the Foreign Ministry said,
quoted by the official Islamic Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed source expressed dismay over recent remarks by
officials of "certain littoral states" on referring the issue to
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that no international organization would be
permitted to interfere in regional matters, as such a measure "will
not only be tantamount to incapability of the littoral states to
settle the issue but will also leave negative impacts on relations
among these states."
</P>
<P>
Littoral states of the Caspian Sea, namely Iran, Russia,
Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, have tried for a long time
to set up a legal regime to govern the sea, which has high
potentials for oil, gas, navigation and fishery.
</P>
<P>
But so far such efforts have failed due to differences among
them.
</P>
<P>
According to two treaties signed in 1921 and 1940, the Caspian
Sea stands as an area shared by Iran and the former Soviet Union,
and the sea should be equally shared and exploited by the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
But the former Soviet Union has now been divided into a number
of independent republics, with three of them bordering the sea,
thus new differences emerged about the exploitation of the rich
Caspian resources.
</P>
<P>
Iran has insisted that the two treaties are still effective, and
it should take 50 percent of the sea if it is to be divided.
Russia, as the successor of the former Soviet Union, could share
the other 50 percent of the sea with Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and
Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
But the Islamic republic also indicated last month that it
prioritizes a joint ownership of the Caspian Sea resources with
other littoral states, saying it was ready to take a 20 percent
share.
</P>
<P>
Iran is not against dividing the sea provided that the division
is being done according to existing treaties and on the basis of
justice, enabling all the littoral states to gain a fair share of
the potentials and resources of the sea, the Foreign Ministry
source said.
</P>
<P>
He recommended the littoral states to try to solve problems
within the framework of regional cooperation and thereby refrain
from any measure that could cause a rift among them.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that Iran has always pursued a policy of peaceful
coexistence and relations with its neighbors. A shared legal regime
is the best alternative for all the littoral states, he added.

.A local military source said that the FAA did not encounter
strong resistance from the rebels, the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) led by Jonas Savinbi, adding
that the fighting lasted 15 minutes with FAA suffering no
significant human and material losses.
</P>
<P>
Cazombo is located 120 kilometers west to the Angolan-Zambian
border and 500 kilometers east to the provincial capital city of
Luena.
</P>
<P>
Earlier the government troops recaptured the town of Quimbele,
a strategic northern district with an airfield that had been
occupied by the rebels for several years, said reports reaching
here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
A Northern Front officer in the provincial capital of Uige was
quoted by the Portuguese Lusa News Agency as saying that Quimbele,
located on the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo, was
retaken by the government troops on September 6.
</P>
<P>
The officer declined to give details of the operation but said
it was a significant victory because UNITA had used the Quimbele
airfield to supply its forces in northwestern region of Angola.
</P>
<P>
Separately, the Zambian Defense Minister Chitalu Sampa said on
Monday in Lusaka that the Zambian troops had pursued raiders led
by UNITA rebels, recovering 100 head of cattle last week.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Revitalize Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian tourism
authorities are mapping out an effective strategy to promote
tourism in the country in the coming five years, a senior official
said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a symposium, Yusuf Abdullahi, chief of the Ethiopian
Tourism Commission, said that the strategy would be formulated in
light of the trend of global tourism and national interest.
</P>
<P>
A national tourism consultative council would be set up to
ensure effective implementation of the strategy, aimed at
optimally exploiting the country's tourist potentials, he said, on
the eve of the World Tourism Day that falls on September 27.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian tourist industry had long been handicapped by the
poor infrastructure and high charges on tourists,  which made
Ethiopia a very expensive tourist destination, said the official.
</P>
<P>
He described 1997 a golden year for the country's tourism,
during which some 140,000 tourists visited Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Had it not been for the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea,
the figure could have risen to 180,000 by 1999, he said.

informing Rwandans of progress of the Tanzania-based tribunal's
work.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Existing-Home Sales Jump 9.3 Percent in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Existing U.S. home sales
surged 9.3 percent in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 5.27 million units, the National Association of Realtors (NAR)
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
It was the biggest rise in existing home sales since June 1999,
when they rose 10.9 percent, and was well above most forecasts on
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
On a year-on-year basis, existing home sales were down 0.6
percent in August.
</P>
<P>
Sales fell a revised 9.2 percent in July to 4.82 million units,
slightly stronger that the initial estimate of a 9.8 percent fall.
</P>
<P>
In the last two weeks of August, the average rate on a 30-year
fixed-rate mortgage fell below the 8 percent mark. For the month,
30-year rates averaged 8.03 percent, down from 8.15 percent in
July. Still, August's rate was considerably higher than the 7.94
percent average rate in August 1999.
</P>
<P>
Even though interest rates are higher compared with a year ago,
Americans have been feeling better off and in a buying mood. That'
s because of plentiful jobs, rising incomes, tame inflation and
stock market gains.
</P>
<P>
In addition, there are lots of available financing options in
an environment of rising mortgage rates.
</P>
<P>
In August, the median existing-home sales price, meaning half
sold for more and half for less, was 142,200 U.S. dollars, up 3.5
percent from the median price for the same month a year ago.
</P>
<P>
By region, the West posted the biggest gain with sales rising
16.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.43 million
in August.
</P>
<P>
In the Midwest, sales rose 10.6 percent to a rate of 1.15
million units. They grew by 5.8 percent in the South to a rate of
2.01 million and sales went up by 4.6 percent in the Northeast to
a rate of 680,000.

<HEADLINE> Annan Pledges to Strengthen U.N. Staff Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said on Monday that he would soon recommend measures on
how to protect the security and safety of U.N. staff in the field.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion of the December 25 U.N. Staff Day,
Annan said, "I am about to submit a report to the General Assembly
that seeks significant changes in the way we provide staff
security: in the number of personnel, in the training they receive,
the services they provide and the equipment they use."
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, it would be impossible to eliminate all risks from
our work. But where we can make a difference, we must," the U.N.
chief said.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, this will cost money, and I will make a strong case
to the General Assembly," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said security is not a luxury or an option, and
member states must live up to their primary responsibility not
only to provide security, but also to bring to justice who violate
it.
</P>
<P>
"This is the very least that those who serve the international
community are entitled to expect," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
The security of U.N. staff becomes main theme of this year's U.
N. Staff Day. According to the United Nations, there were 198
civilian deaths between January 1, 1992 and September 18, 2000.
The figure reflects only civilian personnel and not peace-
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
Of these 198 deaths, 50 were internationally recruited and 148
locally recruited.

<HEADLINE> British Columbia Commune under Polygamy Ring Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. probe into a polygamy
ring has reached the Bountiful commune in the town of Lister,
southern British Columbia (B.C.), the Montreal-based Gazette
newspaper said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We believed there are between 30 and 40 under-age girls who
have been married off to church elders and members in B.C. and the
U.S. over the past two years," according to Jay Beswick of For
Kids' Sake, a California-based international non-profit group
against child abuse.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. investigation has been underway since the weekend over
allegations that American girls as young as 13 to 16 years old
were married to members of the polygamous community on the Utah-
Arizona border and in the town of Lister.
</P>
<P>
The 30,000-member Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-Day Saints is reported to be a breakaway from its
mainstream Mormon.
</P>
<P>
The arranged marriages are increasing because the church leader
has predicted that the end of the world is near and that only
those in "celestial pairings" will be saved.
</P>
<P>
In the Bountiful commune, which has up to 1,000 members, local
businessman and bishop Winston Blackmore, 44, is estimated to have
30 wives and 80 children.
</P>
<P>
Last year, he married several new wives, including a 16-year-
old American girl.

<P>
MOSCOW, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir
Putin on Monday discussed bilateral cooperation in high technology,
energy and world affairs with visiting German Chancellor Gerhardt
Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference following their meeting in the
Kremlin, Putin said the Russian economy is picking up and that is
one reason that Russian-German ties should be boosted, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Putin described Germany as a leading partner of Moscow. He
attributed the decline in bilateral relations over the past year
and half to problems in Russian economics.
</P>
<P>
"A certain economic growth in Russia is now a matter of common
knowledge and we expect the growth to be significant this year.
Naturally, Germany, a leading partner and the main creditor of
Russia, cannot stand aside under such circumstances," he said.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder, who has concluded his four-hour visit and departed
for home, said that during his meeting with Putin, they discussed
strategic partnership, agreeing on regular meetings of politicians,
journalists and businessmen in Koenigswinter, Germany, similar to
the British-German forums that took place there.
</P>
<P>
Putin described Schroeder's latest tour as an indication "of
the changed quality" of their relationship.
</P>
<P>
"I can also add that we have discussed the energy problem in
Europe. Much can be done in that respect if relations with Russia
are put on a long-term basis. We are ready to do that, we want to
develop this type of cooperation. It will be useful for the two
countries and Europe," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said they also discussed the freedom of press and
agreed that it is one of the fundamentals of a democracy.

"searchable" Red List is housed on a designated website www.
redlist.org that will be accessible from the launch day.
</P>
<P>
The compiling of the Red List has involved some 7,000 volunteer
species experts working in almost every country in the world. It
includes more than 18,000 species and has produced some alarming
new facts about the decline of the world's plants and animals.
</P>
<P>
The Red List reveals the countries with the most threatened
species, identifies the habitats that have the most threatened
mammals and birds, and highlights the most significant threats.

<HEADLINE> Greece's Striking Truckers Urged to Show Responsibility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Greek government Monday
urged the country's striking truck drivers and tanker truck owners
to show responsibility as the world fuel prices continue its
upward trend.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, government spokesman Dimitris
Reppas said that the drivers and owners, who are protesting rising
oil and fuel prices, should show a sense of responsibility in
order to limit the consequences of the oil crisis.
</P>
<P>
Claiming the soaring oil prices are putting them out of
business, public truck drivers and tanker truck owners began an
indefinite strike Monday to pressure the government into lowering
fuel taxes and reversing its decision to deregulate the tanker
truck sector.
</P>
<P>
Development Minister Nikos Christodoulakis said Monday in the
northern Greek city of Thessaloniki that the strike had yet to
affect supplies to the country's key industries or services. He
said that oil refineries must maintain their output.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Transport and Communications Minister Christos
Verelis Monday pledged that roads would remain open and refineries
would not be blocked in the strike, which was organized by the
country's truckers union.

BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
said here today that scientific and technological strength and
professionals are the important indicators for the strength of
country and crucial for the implementation of sustainable
development.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during his tour of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (
CAS), the country's leading research organization, the premier
said the fundamental gap between developed and developing
countries rests squarely with the gap between their scientific,
technological strength and professional resources.
</P>
<P>
Science and technology is not only the most advanced
productive force but also determines the future of the economic
development, said the premier.
</P>
<P>
It will provide a solid foundation for economic development to
significantly raise the country's scientific and technological
level and maintain a ready supply of professionals, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of basic research, saying that if
China could not catch up with the advanced international level in
the field,it would be difficult for the country to realize the its
development goals.
</P>
<P>
He said CAS assumes a major task in undertaking basic research,
which is also the foundation for China to become prosperous.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu urged CAS to fully understand its historic
responsibility and continue its efforts in basic research.
</P>
<P>
The premier spoke highly of CAS's pilot project for
encouraging innovation,launched in 1998 by the Chinese government
to promote innovation around the country.
</P>
<P>
He said the State Council will continue to fully support the
pilot project and hopes CAS will continue its endeavor to reach
its goal.

Earlier today, accompanied by CAS President Lu Yongxiang, Zhu
toured the Institute of Geology and Geophysics and the Institute

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican Defense Forces
(FADM) on Monday asked for more resources to reinforce its ability
to safeguard the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
"Basic, but efficient, resources are necessary to carry out
missions related to the defense of territorial integrity,
sovereignty and independence, particularly concerning maritime
boundaries," said Lagos Lidimo, Chief of Staff of the FADM.
</P>
<P>
It is essential that the armed forces should have dissuasive
means to fight against the illegal use of Mozambican waters for
drug trafficking or illegal immigration, he told Mozambican
President Joaquim Chissano during a ceremony which marked the 36th
anniversary of the launching of the liberation struggle against
Portuguese colonialism.
</P>
<P>
"In this case and in other areas it would be very useful if
there was a greater coordination between the various sectors of
the Defense and Security Forces, in order to ensure security for
citizens and their property," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chissano praised the FADM as a promoter of national unity,
saying the armed forces are essential to promote peace and
consolidate democracy.
</P>
<P>
Reinforcement of the army has already begun but it can not be
completed soon, he said.
</P>
<P>
Due to difficult economic condition in the country, Mozambique'
s military budget only accounts for a small percent in the
national budget, resulting in outdated weapons and equipment for
the army.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Oil Price, Interest Rate Concerns Have No Prolonged Effects on HK Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Oil price and interest rate
concerns will have no prolonged impact on Hong Kong's economy,
said Steven Li, deputy head of regional research for Chase JF,
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his departure for Chase JF's sixth annual Asia
Conference in New York, Li told Xinhua that he remains optimistic
about the medium term outlook for the Hong Kong market.
</P>
<P>
The recent market correction that brought Hang Seng Index (HSI)
below 15,000 points has come amid concerns over rising oil prices
and diverging views on interest rates, he said, noting that oil is
not a concern for Hong Kong, given its status as a service-based
economy with only 6 percent of GDP in manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
"As far as interest rates are concerned, we don't expect U.S.
rates to rise, and Hong Kong's real rates are expected to fall by
400 basis points by the first half of 2001 as deflation diminishes,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
He said large caps such as Hutchison, China Mobile and Sun Hung
Kai Properties have fallen to very attractive levels following the
recent correction, while local banks have fallen excessively on
interest rate fears.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong scored a year-on-year GDP growth rate of 12.8 percent
in the first half of this year, said Li, who is confident that the
full year 2000 forecast of 9.6 percent will be achieved.
</P>
<P>
While overall growth will moderate owing to slowing exports,
significant improvements are expected in the domestic economy as
unemployment falls and deflation moderates, he said, noting that
this would bring considerable benefits to listed equities.
</P>
<P>
Banking, real estate and retail sectors are expected to see
improved operating conditions, he said, while tourism and office
property have already seen noticeable improvements.
</P>
<P>
"As we enter the fourth quarter of this year, fund raising is
emerging as a critical issue," Li noted.
</P>
<P>
Fund raising to the tune of 12 billion U.S. dollars is expected
in October, including the placement of Pacific Century Cyberworks
(PCCW) and the Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) of Sinopec and Hong
Kong MTR.
</P>
<P>
These fund raisings are expected to put significant downward
pressure on the market, particularly on telecom and China-related
stocks, he said, adding that the market performance will improve
dramatically after the completion of these fund raisings.
</P>
<P>
Li said his earning forecast for the HSI has recently fallen,
but the reason is technical in nature, as three very high P/E
ratio stocks replaced lower R/E ratio stocks in HSI constituents
in August.
</P>
<P>
Changing constituents have also resulted in a lower dividend
yield for the market, given the low payouts of the new
constituents relative to the shares they have replaced, he
explained.
</P>
<P>
This had also lead to some concern that fund raising could have
a greater impact on the market, as the smaller amount of cash
being paid is resulting in higher net cash calls, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The index could become more volatile given the trading
histories of the new constituents, he said.

BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- With the successful
implementation of the family planning policy, China has witnessed
rapid development in the economy and living standards of the
Chinese people has remarkably improved, said Vice-Premier Li
Lanqing here today.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks when meeting with representatives from all
over the country, who had made outstanding contribution in
carrying out the policy.
</P>
<P>
Family planning is a fundamental policy of China and the
central government always emphasizes its importance, said Li,
adding that without family planning, an extra 300 million people
would have been born.
</P>
<P>
The Vice-Premier also pointed out that in the next century,
China will still face challenges from population and birth control.
</P>
<P>
Li called upon all party members and Youth League members to
carry out the family planning policy for the prosperity of the
country.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, a national teleconference on rewarding
outstanding workers and work units in implementing the policy was
held and Wang Zhongyu, secretary-general of the State Council
delivered a speech on family planning work.
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, the central government issued an open letter,
calling on all party members and Youth League members to make
contribution to controlling China's population and implementing
the family planning policy in the most populous country on earth.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Determined to Straighten up Chinese Tourist Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Thailand has high hopes for the new regulations," Pradech said,
referring to the implementation plan on joint regulation of
tourist market signed by the two countries' tourism authorities in
Kunming, China in August.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is going to cooperate with China in visa-issuing to
control tour program, Pradech said.
</P>
<P>
The TAT will provide the designated Chinese travel agencies
with "information card" containing information on the rights and
protection of tourists, necessary names and contact information of
relevant travel agencies for lodging complaints, according to the
regulation.
</P>
<P>
The card is to be used for applying for visa by attaching with
tourists' passports and filled up with names and license numbers
of travel agencies arranging land operation in Thailand. Tourists
will also be informed with the tour arrangement beforehand.
</P>
<P>
"If tourists found the whole program did not follow the set
procedure, they can complain to relevant agencies. And if a tour
operator was found misconducted, it will be blacklisted or being
removed from the list of the designated travel agencies," Pradech
said.
</P>
<P>
As for the 18-U.S.-dollar minimum tour price per day for
Chinese tourists in Thailand, the governor said it is designed to
maintain the standard of tour operation and services, with the
minimum land arrangement cost being adjusted in correspondence
with the conditions and cost factors in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the minimum tour price will affect the
tourist arrivals from China, Pradech said though the competition
among major Southeast Asian tourist destinations are "fierce,"
Thailand will not trade off its national image and resources for
immediate gains.
</P>
<P>
"We are doing this because we want to attract more Chinese
tourists in the future," said the governor
</P>
<P>
The TAT will set up some information counters on October 1 at
Don Muang International Airport in Bangkok to help Chinese
tourists, according to an informed source from TAT.
</P>
<P>
China is the third largest tourism market for Thailand, after
Japan and Malaysia.

<HEADLINE> Manila Concerned Over Reported Arrest of Filipinos in Sabah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
showed its concern over the reported arrest of Filipinos by
Malaysia in its state of Sabah, although Manila said Monday it
does not believe the incident would result in another diplomatic
row between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Press Secretary Ricardo Puno told a press briefing here that
the Philippine government has faith that the Malaysian authorities
would observe international law in dealing with such kind of
situation.
</P>
<P>
"There are provisions of international law that governs the
treatment of any individuals who try to enter another country even
if without proper documentation," Puno said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Philippines and Malaysia have had experiences in
trying to handle this problem in the past.
</P>
<P>
Puno was reacting to reports that the Malaysian authorities in
Sabah have arrested boatloads of Filipinos who tried to enter
Sabah during the past three days.
</P>
<P>
Kuala Lumpur has tightened its maritime border with the
Southern Philippines to prevent the entry of Abu Sayyaf terrorists
now being hunted down by the military in Sulu province, about one
hour ride in speedboat from Sabah.
</P>
<P>
Puno also said that we should not overreact to the reported
shoot-to-kill or shoot-on-sight order issued by the Malaysian
authorities against Filipino dissidents entering their territory.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Malaysian authorities have clarified that
their shoot-to-kill order will be followed only if the intruder
would resist arrest.

<HEADLINE> Inter-Korean Defense Ministers to Meet Again in DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 25 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) Monday agreed to hold their
second round of inter-Korean defense ministers' talks at DPRK's
Mount Paektu in November, the South Korean Defense Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached at the first-ever inter-Korean
defense ministers' meeting held in Cheju, South Korea Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
The two-day closed-door meeting was attended by South Korean
Defense Minister Cho Sung-tae and DPRK Minister of People's Armed
Forces Kim Il Chol, marking another milestone in the inter-Korean
reconciliation process.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK minister, who leads a five-member delegation, flew to
the island of Cheju for the meeting Sunday afternoon after
entering South Korea through the truce village of Panmumjom.
</P>
<P>
The meeting focuses on the military issues on reconnecting the
inter-Korean railway and road system, but the South Korean
military is reportedly seeking the establishment of a military
hotline, prior notification of large-scale military drills and
troop movements and military exchanges.
</P>
<P>
It hopes that a joint statement to cooperate in reducing
tension on the Korean Peninsula will be made at the end of the
meeting tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The inter-Korean ties have gradually improved since the
historic summit in Pyongyang on June 13-15, in which South Korean
President Kim Dae-jung and DPRK leader Kim Jong Il agreed to seek
reconciliation and eventual reunification through exchanges and
cooperation in almost all fields.

<HEADLINE> China Urges More Support to Developing Nations from World Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Finance Minister Xiang
Huaicheng urged here Monday the World Bank to make more effective
and efficient efforts to support the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 62nd meeting of the Development Committee of the
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, Xiang said as a
multilateral development institution, the World Bank should beef
up its support to the developing nations in their development
process to promote global poverty reduction and long-term
development.
</P>
<P>
He called on the World Bank and other multilateral institutions
to adhere to the principle of political neutrality and represent
equally the interests of each member state.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Xiang said in recent years, politicization of the
World Bank has been intensified, which has seriously jeopardized
the interests of developing countries, especially the small ones.
</P>
<P>
Xiang called on the Bank Management and all member countries to
strictly adhere to the World Bank's Articles of Agreement,
particularly the principle that only economic considerations are
relevant in serving its borrowers.
</P>
<P>
"The Bank must not make concessions to political pressures from
some members. Instead, it must stand firm against politicization
and maintain its political neutrality," he said.
</P>
<P>
Xiang also said the ability of the World Bank in helping the
developing nations has been restricted as the cost of doing
business with the bank for the borrowing countries has been rising
considerably, even to the level that they can hardly afford it.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the World Bank take concrete steps to
simplify and streamline its safeguard policies, diagnosis and
assessments so as to cut the cost of delivering its services and
ensure competitiveness of its lending.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Disappointed at Players' Performances in Sydney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 25 (Xinhua) -- "The standard of
competition here is much, much tougher than I had anticipated,"
President of the National Olympic Committee of South Africa (NOCSA)
Sam Ramsamy said in Sydney on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Before the Olympic Games, Ramsamy had predicted that South
Africa would bring home eight medals from the Sydney 2000 sporting
showpiece.
</P>
<P>
However, he is now no longer interested in making predictions,
especially after South Africa failed to gain the number of medals
he had hoped for in the swimming competition last week.
</P>
<P>
"The level of competition is like nothing I've ever seen before,
" Ramsamy added.
</P>
<P>
There were high hopes for the South African swimming team
especially after their performances in the same pool a year ago
when they won seven medals at the Pan Pacific Games and Penny
Heyns scorched to a number of world records.
</P>
<P>
"Even the Americans and the Australians have been surprised at
the depth of talent from Europe which featured in the pool last
week," Ramsamy remarked, "We certainly did not count on the
Netherlands, Sweden, Italy and Romania doing so well when we did
our assessments."
</P>
<P>
But Ramsamy was extemely happy with the rowing teams who had
all managed to qualify for finals in their categories, even the
baseballers, who have come in for a lot of flak, could be excused
as they had to face some tough competition.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Not Ready for Hosting Olympic Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 25 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is not
ready to host an Olympic Games on the scale of Sydney and will
have to watch the 2004 Games in Athens before deciding whether or
not again to launch a host bid, Sports Minister Balfour said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"What I have seen in Sydney really scares me," he told
jornalists at South African National Assembly in Cape Town
following his return from Australia.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure, after seeking what is happening in Sydney, that
any one city in South Africa could handle the Olympic Games as
they are at the moment," Balfour said.
</P>
<P>
"I probably would not want to say I am happy we did not win the
2004 bid. But if we had won, we would now really be frightened of
what to do for 2004, after seeing what Sydney has put together,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Singing Sydney's praises in its organization, its transport
system and the electric atmosphere of the city, Balfour said he
believed some of the events would have to be trimmed before any
developing country could seriously consider hosting the event.
</P>
<P>
"If we go on this way, developing countries will never be able
to host the Games. But if we can have some sports trimmed from the
Games, even developing countries will be able to host th Olympics,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Balsour was unstinting in his praise of the South
African team at the Games, saying the exprience gained by younger
members was worth the effort.

<P>
He added that Iran and Iraq, two rival countries of Israel, are
also developing nuclear warheads that represent a real danger to
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian peace negotiations which resumed last
December broke down in January when Israel refused to promise a
full return of the strategic Golan Heights captured in the 1967
Middle East Six-Day War.
</P>
<P>
In apparent efforts to enhance its deterrence, Israel has been
engaged in a series of tests of its Arrow-2 anti-ballistic missile
system, which on September 14 successfully intercepted a simulated
ballistic missile target launched towards the shores of Israel
similar to the Scud missiles that Iraq fired at Israel during the
Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The system is designed to deal with Scud and Scud-derived
ballistic missiles in the arsenals of Syria, Iran and Iraq. Its
first battalion was deployed in central Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel officially declared in March its newly-developed Arrow-2
missile defense system operational, rendering Israel the first
country in the world to have the capacity to defend itself against
ballistic missile attacks.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Committee Approves Amended Jerusalem Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 25 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli parliamentary
committee Monday endorsed an amendment to Israel's Basic Law on
Jerusalem, which may further limit Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
flexibility in the negotiations with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The amendment bill, authored by legislator Yehoshua Matza from
the right-wing opposition Likud, will require the support of an
absolute majority, or 61 members, in the 120-seat Knesset, to
change Jerusalem's municipal borders or transfer any state or
municipal authorities in the city to a non-Israeli entity.
</P>
<P>
The bill had been approved by the Knesset plenum in its
preliminary reading in May. Monday's vote in the Knesset Law
Committee for the bill is four to two, which paved the way for the
bill to the plenum for further readings.
</P>
<P>
The Knesset, which will reconvene at the end of October after
summer recess, is scheduled to debate the bill at the first week,
parliamentary sources said.
</P>
<P>
Law Committee Chairman Amnon Rubinstein, a left-wing Meretz
party legislator who voted against the bill, said after the vote
that the only aim of the bill was "to tie the hands of the
government" on the negotiating table with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The fate of Jerusalem is the major bottleneck in the peace
process, which holds up a final peace deal between Israel and the
Palestinians. Israel claims the holy city as its "eternal and
undivided" capital, while the Palestinians want East Jerusalem,
which Israel occupied in the 1967 Mideast war, as the capital of
their future state.
</P>
<P>
Last July's Camp David summit between Barak, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton foundered mainly on
the thorny issue.
</P>
<P>
Barak reportedly made unprecedented compromises on the Jerusalem
issue during the summit to agree that the Jerusalem municipality
could be expanded and include several Arab towns and Jewish
settlements on the outskirts of the city. Then, the Palestinians
could claim sovereignty on these Arab towns and call them Al-Qods
(Jerusalem).
</P>
<P>
However, these compromises were rejected by the Palestinians,
who insisted Israeli withdrawal from the whole East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Should Knesset approves the amendment, the Jerusalem issue will
be irresolvable as Barak's coalition only controls one-third seats
in the parliament.

<HEADLINE> Rift Valley Fever Kills 27 in Saudi Arabia: Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The epidemic Rift Valley
Fever (RVF) has claimed 27 lives in Saudi Arabia as 129 infections
have been reported, reports reaching here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
An official Saudi report issued Sunday put the death toll at 24
and the infected at 113.
</P>
<P>
The RVF disease, which broke out in Saudi southern city of Jizan
two weeks ago, was first identified in Kenya, Africa, in 1930, and
was believed to have been brought in Saudi Arabia by people already
infected with it.
</P>
<P>
The killer disease starts with symptoms such as high fever,
diarrhea and vomiting.
</P>
<P>
As animals such as cattle and sheep are also vulnerable to the
epidemic disease, Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz has ordered
authorities concerned to destroy all livestock suspected of being
infected.
</P>
<P>
Special teams equipped with planes and helicopters have been
sent to Jizan to spray insecticides against mosquitoes, which carry
the virus from infected animals to humans.
</P>
<P>
Other areas of the kingdom have also taken measures to prevent
the spreading of the pestilence.
</P>
<P>
Health officials in Riyadh area are checking passengers coming
by road and air from the southern areas of Jizan, Bisha and Najran.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the Saudi government has been seeking help from the
World Health Organization and the United States to follow up the
developments of the disease and contain it.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Acting FM Calls for Tough Decisions by Israel, Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli acting Foreign Minister
Shlomo Ben-Ami said here on Monday that Israel and the Palestinians
must make tough decisions in a bid to achieve peace.
</P>
<P>
During a lightening visit, Ben-Ami met with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak and held talks with Foreign Minister Amr Moussa to
discuss the latest developments of the Palestinian-Israeli peace
negotiations and ideas proposed by all parties concerned to the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the meetings, Ben-Ami said there
have been many ideas and proposals aimed at helping Israel and the
Palestinians resolve the thorny issues in their negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"We must now make tough choices" in an effort to reach a
framework agreement covering all core issues, especially the most
difficult issue of Jerusalem, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli top negotiator in the faltering peace talks with the
Palestinians said his country is making "sincere attempts" to reach
a comprehensive agreement with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
But in the meantime, he said, Israel would consider a partial
agreement if a comprehensive deal in out of reach.
</P>
<P>
Israel never rules out the possibility to delay the issue of
Jerusalem in case a comprehensive agreement can not be reached,
Ben-Ami said.
</P>
<P>
But this question is not on the agenda at this moment when all
parties are trying to exhaust the possibilities to reach an
agreement on all pending issues, he added.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami wrapped up the brief visit to Egypt after the meetings
and traveled to Amman, Jordan for further discussions on the
Mideast peace process.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Grants 3 Million U.S. Dollars to College Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian
government has disbursed loans and allowances totaling 2.4 billion
Tanzanian shillings (about 3 million U.S. dollars) to students of
higher learning institutions for the first semester of the 2000/
2001 academic year, newspapers here reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 12,336 students in various universities, colleges
and institutes will receive 2,000 shillings (about 2.5 dollars)
per day from this disbursement, the newspapers cited an official
statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The government has also allocated all requested funds for
special faculty requirements, books and stationary allowances and
research/project allowances for the entire academic year," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The government is implementing the second phase of higher
education cost-sharing policy which began in 1994/95 when it
introduced the students loan scheme to assist them meet some of
their boarding and lodging costs.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, reports said students of the University of Dar es

</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the Ministry of Science, Technology

organization leaders on the matter and informed them "amicably and
transparently" that their demands could not be met due to
budgetary constraints and a higher education cost-sharing scheme.

<P>
"The government has taken steps to increase accommodation
facilities, giving as an example the hostels which can accommodate
4,200 students at Mabibo in Dar es Salaam which the National

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Alrosa Diamond
Company will soon grant some 35 million U.S.dollars for the
restoration of a hydroelectric station in Angola's diamond-rich
eastern province of Lunda-Sul, the official news agency Angop
reported here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The project will take three years to complete, as technicians
from both sides are already planning to start the job in the
coming days, Alrosa Chairman Vetchilov Sitirov was quoted as
saying last weekend while meeting Angolan Minister of Water and
Energy Luis Filipe da Silva.
</P>
<P>
On his side, Luis Filipe said with the conclusion of the
project, which is located in the Chicapa municipality, there will
be cheaper power, less maintenance and fuel transport problems in
the area.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Meteorologists fear that
despite predictions of normal rainfall in the forthcoming rainy
season in the southern African region, areas hit by floods early
this year may suffer again because the soils remain waterlogged,
the Noticias daily reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, a meeting of the Regional Weather
Forecast Forum held in Botswana last week warned against this
possibility and recommended that weather information be widely
publicized in the entire region.
</P>
<P>
All weather information should be made available to all
institutions dealing with disaster management, health, water
supply and agriculture in order to allow the necessary planning of
their activities, said participants at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
They cautioned that "some of the areas in the sub-region
experienced floods during the last rainy season and in some of
them soils are still waterlogged."
</P>
<P>
The meeting also recommended monthly monitoring of the weather
changes in various countries of the region, saying a further
meeting will take place in December this year to assess the
changes that will have occurred by then.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Calls for New Round of WTO Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 25 (Xinhua) -- South African Trade and
Industry Minister Alec Erwin Monday urged the international
community to work towards establishing a new round of World Trade
Organization (WTO) talks.
</P>
<P>
Opening the International Textile Manufacturers Federation
annual conference in Cape Town, Erwin said a new round of talks is
fundamentally important for the developing world.
</P>
<P>
"I urge you to argue for the opening of the world trade system
and for a new round of world growth," he said. "The future cannot
be positive in a protectionist world."
</P>
<P>
Erwin stressed that the new round must be balanced between the
first-world economies and the developing world and must cover a
comprehensive range of trade issues.
</P>
<P>
The last WTO meeting was held in Seattle, the United States
late last year to launch a new round of negotiations to cut
barriers to world trade but it broke down.
</P>
<P>
There is an urgent need to reconsider world trade movements,
Erwin said, insisting that "there needs to be a realization that
the absorption of resources of agricultural products in the North
prevents the development of agriculture in the South."
</P>
<P>
High tariffs in industrialized countries remain obstacles to
free trade for developing economies and anti-dumping measures
could be used as a new type of protectionism, he said.

<HEADLINE> London Stock Exchange Accuses Sweden's Takeover Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 25 (Xinhua) - The London Stock Exchange (LSE)
described on Monday the 808-million-pound takeover bid by Sweden's
OM Company as "wholly inadequate."
</P>
<P>
The board of the LSE warned that exchange shareholders would
suffer a "terminal loss of influence" if the "derisory" deal went
through.
</P>
<P>
OM's plan to develop the exchange through introducing new
technology "offers no clear benefits" and would impose
unpredictable changeover costs, the LSE said in a letter to the
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
The LSE argued that OM's bid "fundamentally undervalues the
London Stock Exchange's pre-eminent market position, its financial
strength and its prospects."
</P>
<P>
LSE Chairman Don Cruickshank said in the letter that "we
believe that OM's offer is an attempt to buy your company on the
cheap, predominantly using new OM shares, which are of uncertain
value."
</P>
<P>
However, the LSE bowed to OM demands for limits on the size of
its shareholdings to be reviewed, and is expected to hold a
meeting on October 19 to allow shareholders to vote on the issue.

SYDNEY, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Cathy Freeman became the first
Australian Aboriginal to claim an Olympic gold medal as she won
the women's 400m event at the 27th Olympic Games here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Freeman, 27, world champions in the 1997 and 1999 World

athletics gold. Lorraine Graham of Jamaica took the silver in 49.
58 and Britain's Katharine Merry won the bronze in 49.72.

Freeman became the first woman to win successive 400m title at

confidence of my mother gave me the strength to win. I knew about
half way through the race that I had the race won."
</P>
<P>
Jackson, winner of last year's World Championships, said: "It
was a very messy race. My feet felt tight in the blocks with the
false start so that's why I moved them. I really didn't get a
clean race after that."
</P>
<P>
Jackson, who never won an Olympic gold, said: "It's difficult
to accept but you learn to accept it. This is athletics. You have
to just accept it and go on with the business."

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Expands Cooperation with Friendship Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, September 25 (Xinhua) -- In March, 1981, a giant panda
was sent to Kobe via Tianjin. The six-month visit of the "envoy"
was a hit among the Japanese, and over 10 million people poured
into Kobe to see it, which has helped strengthen the links between
the two cities and the Sino-Japanese friendship as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin, a port city in north China, clinched friendly
relations with the Japanese city of Kobe on June 24 of 1973, a
year after the normalization of the Sino-Japanese relations.
</P>
<P>
As a prelude for Japanese investments in Tianjin, the first
Japanese bar in China was opened in October, 1984.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Japanese investments in the city involve more than 1,
200 enterprises, with contractual investments exceeding 1.9
billion US dollars. Of them, Kobe-based enterprises have injected
nearly 200 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Tianjin has established friendly ties with 50
cities of 35 countries. Exchanges and cooperation with its
friendship cities have enhanced economic and trade collaboration
with other countries, and have also pushed forward the city's
opening-up.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the government of Lombardia Region, Italy, decided
to cooperate with the Tianjin municipal government in building
China's first exotic zone along the bank of the Haihe River in
Tianjin. Once completed, the Italian Zone, covering 200,000
square meters, will provide new opportunities for the city's
growth in trade, commerce, industry and tourism.
</P>
<P>
An official at Tianjin Foreign Affairs Office said the city
seeks all-round and substantial cooperation with its counterparts
worldwide in such sectors as trade, culture, education,
environmental protection, tourism and training.

<HEADLINE> China Controls Rapid Population Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Rapid population growth in
China has been kept under control during the 1996-2000 period, in
which population pressure on the country's social and economic
developments was eased, and living standards improved.
</P>
<P>
China has become a country with a low birth rate since
implementing the family planning policy in the 1970s. Without
family planning, an extra 338 million people would have been born
in the country during this period, costing an extra 7,000 billion
yuan (approximately 843 million U.S. dollars) in child-care.
</P>
<P>
Statistics in 1998 showed that on average a Chinese woman had
less than two children in her lifetime, compared with four in 1970.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the low birth rate, the adult population is
beginning to account for a larger percent of the country's total
population. In 1999, the proportion of children to adults in China
was 54:100.
</P>
<P>
Slower population growth has provided a better environment for
economic development and social progress. In 1998, per capita
Gross National Product in China doubled the figure of 1980 three
years ahead of expectations.
</P>
<P>
Population control in China has also helped delay the world's
six billion population figure for a further four years.

Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat are to meet Monday night
in a bid to break the current impasse in the peace talks, Israel
Radio Monday quoted a Palestinian source close to the talks as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between the two leaders will be their first since

</P>
<P>
Israeli acting Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami earlier said the

<P>
The peace talks are foundered over disputes on the fate of
Jerusalem and the Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
The radio also quoted the source as saying that Israeli and
Palestinian delegations are setting out for Washington to continue
negotiations on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo told Voice of
Palestine radio that the teams will hold talks with the U.S.
officials and examine whether there are changes in each other's
positions since the Camp David summit.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Fresh Clash Injures two in Indonesia's Ambon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- After more than one month of
calm, a new clash broke out in Ambon, Indonesia's Maluku province,
wounding two people and burning a dozen of houses, Antara News
Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
It said that the new clash broke out on Monday morning at about
10:00 local time at Suli Village, Salahutu District in Central
Ambon regency.
</P>
<P>
The clash took place when a group of Tulehu villagers got
together and launched an attack at their neighboring Suli
villagers, it said.
</P>
<P>
"We got reports that at least 30 houses were set on fire and
two local villagers injured and evacuated to the local military
hospital," local security officer Maj. M. Djari said.
</P>
<P>
But he said that so far there is no official report on the
cause of the attack.
</P>
<P>
Ambon saw nearly two years of communal bloodshed involving
Muslims and Christians.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of lives from both sides were claimed and hundreds of
thousands took refuge to the neighboring provinces.
</P>
<P>
The central government has imposed a civilian emergency to the
province since June this year in a bid to put an end to the
bloodshed which has raised international concerns.

<HEADLINE> Floods Jeopardize Food Prospects in Asia: United Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The countries affected by the natural disasters are China,
India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam and Laos,
regional office for Asia and Pacific of the U.N. Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) said in the release.
</P>
<P>
In addition to enormous economic damage, hundreds of people
have been killed by these natural disasters and hundreds of
thousands have had to be evacuated, the release said.
</P>
<P>
"As monsoon rains are due to continue for some time, in parts,
there are concerns that the situation could worsen considerably,"
it said.
</P>
<P>
Humanitarian relief operations are underway but are being
impeded by lack of access to many areas due to high flood waters.
</P>
<P>
In India, following serious drought earlier this year which
affected a number of western and southern states, severe floods
during the monsoon season have devastated many parts of the
country, killing several hundred people, displacing thousands and
destroying crops.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the disruption to agriculture, marketing and
communications, the food supply situation in some states is
extremely tight, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
The FAO estimates that aggregate 2000 to 2001 rice production
in India may be affected and be lower than the 90 million tons
forecast earlier.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere on the subcontinent, in Bangladesh, in the first 10
days of September, some 60,000 people were made homeless and
several were killed. Problems of drinking water and food supplies
are reported.
</P>
<P>
Heavy monsoon rains, floods and landslides also killed a number
of people and displaced thousands in the worst affected areas in
central Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Along the Mekong River basin, one of the most important rice
producing areas in Southeast Asia, aid agencies report that as
many as four million people have been affected.
</P>
<P>
In Cambodia, humanitarian and food supply concerns continue to
mount with the country facing the highest flood levels in 70 years.
</P>
<P>
In Vietnam, the worst flooding in 40 years in the Mekong Delta
has resulted in 43 deaths and large scale displacement of people,
while many homes have been destroyed and some areas are facing
serious food shortages.
</P>
<P>
In addition, some 100,000 hectares of rice have been damaged or
destroyed, while the economic cost so far is put at 26 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Official estimates indicate that some 836 of around 2,000
subdistricts of Thailand were affected by floods, and the economic
damage was put at about 30 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Around 645,000 hectares of crops were damaged or destroyed in
over 24 provinces. Overall rice prospects of Thailand in 2000 to
2001 remain uncertain, the press release said.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Seeks Donations to Import Rhinos From S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Uganda Wildlife Education
Center (UWEC) said it needs about 160,000 U.S. dollars to buy and
transport white rhinos, an endangered animal species, from South
Africa for resettlement in the east African country, the New
Vision daily reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We require 60,000 dollars to purchase and airlift and about
100,000 dollars to organize a location, establish hay-growing and
set up other infrastructure for the rhinos' multiplication," UWEC
Technical Advisor Wilhelm Moeller was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said UWEC has appealed to a number of local and foreign
donors to support the rhino project.
</P>
<P>
White rhinos, as well as black rhinos, got extinct in Uganda
about 20 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Expects Foreign Investment to Double in Five Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania expects
foreign investment in the next five years to exceed 5 billion U.S.
dollars as the country launches more investment projects in the
mining, agriculture and tourism sector, media here reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Emmanuel Ole Naiko, investment promotion director of the
Tanzania Investment Center (TIC), was quoted as saying on Sunday
that the bulk of this investment will come from the mining sector
where several new gold mines would start production next year.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture is also expected to become a major sector for
inflow of foreign investment, he said, stressing that "the
government has already announced attractive incentives to
investors to agriculture processing sector."
</P>
<P>
According to Naiko, TIC is now in advanced discussions with the
Ministry of Lands and Urban Settlement Development to prepare a
land plan which would identify areas suitable for projects on
irrigation and cultivation of high-yield crops.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the tourism industry is also set to attract heavy
investment and more five-star hotels will be built in Dar es
Salaam in the next five years, he said.

<HEADLINE> Day-10 Roundup: Freeman Realizes Dream for Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Michael Johnson of the United
States could have been the superstar of the Sydney Olympic Games
on Monday when he became the first man to win back-to-back 400
meters Olympic gold medals, but it was Cathy Freeman who really
sparkled by winning the women's 400m, a gold medal that the hosts
have been dreaming for four years.
</P>
<P>
Running in a chilly weather, Freeman, clad in a space-suit, had
a comfortable win in 49.13 seconds, beating Lorraine Graham of
Jamaica and Britain's Katharine Merry to the second and third.
</P>
<P>
By taking the title, Freeman became the first Aborigine to win
an individual Olympic gold medal.
</P>
<P>
While in the men's 400m, Johnson made Olympic history by
becoming the first man to successfully defend his title. The world
champion never was challenged in the final, which he won in 43.84,
well off his world record.
</P>
<P>
In other track finals, Virgilijus Alekna of Lithuania won the
discus, Anier Garcia of Cuba the 110m hurdles, Stacy Dragila of
the United States the first Olympic women's pole vault, Romania's
Gabriela Szabo the women's 5,000m, Maria Mutola of Mozambique the
800m, Britain's Jonathan Edwards the men's triple jump and Haile
Gebrselassie of Ethopia the men's 10,000m.
</P>
<P>
It could have been a quiet day for the Americans if there were
not the release of a drug scandal involving the husband of
American sprint star Marion Jones.
</P>
<P>
The International Amateur Athletic Federation said in a
statement Jones' husband, shot put world champion C.J. Hunter, had
tested positive for a banned drug in Oslo on July 28.
</P>
<P>
"The IAAF confirms that shot putter C.J. Hunter of the United
states has tested positive for a banned substance within the IAAF
control system," the IAAF said.
</P>
<P>
Hunter withdrew from the Olympics citing a knee injury earlier
this month. His wife Jones is attempting to win a record five gold
medals here, and won the 100 meters gold medal on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The American Track and Field Association has also been
criticised for a wide-range doping cover-up for more than a decade.
The head of the International Olympic Commitee's medical
commission accused U.S. track and field officials of covering up
five positive drug tests before the 1988 Seoul Olympics. Prince
Alexandre de Merode said he didn't recall the names of the
athletes, but that some may have won medals.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Olympic Committee responded that there were actually
eight cases 12 years ago, noting the athletes involved were
cleared because they inadvertently used the drug, ephedrine, in an
herb supplement called Mahuang.
</P>
<P>
The International Weightlifting Federation also got a blow
Monday when their blanket ban on Bulgaria's weightlifters was
overturned by the Court of Arbitation for Sports. And hours later,
Alan Tsagaev won a silver medal in 105-kilogram competition,
behind gold medalist Hossein Tavakoli of Iran.
</P>
<P>
China completed its clean sweep in the table tennis when Kong
Linhui brushed aside Jan-Ove Waldner of Sweden to win the men's
singles title. Chinese paddlers also won the women's singles,
men's and women's doubles events.
</P>
<P>
In gymnastics, China collected two more gold medals with Li
Xiaopeng winning the men's parallel bars and Liu Xuan taking the
women's beam.
</P>
<P>
Spain's Gervasio Deferr won the men's vault and men's all-
around gold medalist Alexei Nemov had the high bars title.
</P>
<P>
Another Russian Elena Zamolodtchikova gave a outstanding
performance in floor exercise, winning her second gold in as many
days.
</P>
<P>
In women's beach volleyball, the Australian team of Natalie
Cook and Kerri Pottharst won the gold, defeating Brazilians Adiana
Behar and Shelde Bede in the final.
</P>
<P>
After ten-day competitions, the United States kept their
leading place medal standings with 23 golds. China was second at
21 while Russia pushed Australia out of the top three for the
first time since the Games began, at 14 golds.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- A set of Buddhist scriptures,
published at the order of an ancient Chinese emperor 260 years ago,

<HEADLINE> China to Honor Commitments in Telecom Market Opening </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- China will honor its
commitments in the opening of its telecommunications market after
its accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), the Minister
of Information Industry Wu Jichuan said here today.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks at a press conference held by the State
Council Information Office.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that China will obey the principle of
fairness, transparency and non-discrimination in dealing with
market accession.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that China is in the process of drafting
regulations concerning the participation of foreign businesses in
China's telecommunications sector, which will be promulgated
before China's accession to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
He refuted the saying that the regulations will include
requirements on the turnover and other indices of foreign partners.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he said that it is necessary to impose
certain restrictions on the qualification of foreign partners,
which is not only an international practice, but also a necessity
for the protection of consumers' interests, as telecommunications
businesses must have the capacity to serve consumers on a long-
term basis.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, China will also open the
telecommunications sector to the private sector of the country.
</P>
<P>
"Private businesses meeting certain conditions will be allowed
into the sector upon approval," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Hu
Jintao met here today with a delegation from the Sasakawa Japan-
China Friendship Fund led by Setsuya Tabuchi and Yohei Sasakawa.
</P>
<P>
Hu, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, praised
the fund for its long-term efforts on promoting the Sino-Japanese
friendship.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the efforts of both sides, Hu said, Sino-Japanese
relations have seen constant growth in recent years.
</P>
<P>
To draw lessons from history for future developments, Hu said,
Chinese President Jiang Zemin and the Japanese leader reached a
consensus for the build-up of a friendly and cooperative
partnership devoted to peace and development during Jiang's trip
to Japan in 1998. "The consensus blueprinted an all-round,
concrete cooperation between the two countries and brought Sino-
Japanese relations up to a new phase," Hu added.
</P>
<P>
At the turn of the century, Sino-Japanese relations have seen
new opportunities and certain problems have also deserved
attention from both sides, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the two countries should strengthen contacts,
deepen understanding, expand mutual trust and overcome obstacles.
</P>
<P>
"The Sino-Japanese relations will witness a long-term and
stable development, should the two countries honor the spirit set
forth in the 1972 Sino-Japanese Joint Statement, the 1978 Sino-
Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship and the 1998 Sino-Japanese
Joint Declaration and proceed from the overall situation of
maintaining Sino-Japanese friendship," he added.
</P>
<P>
He was confident that Premier Zhu Rongji's forthcoming visit to
Japan will be an impetus to Sino-Japanese relations.
</P>
<P>
Tabuchi and Sasakawa briefed Hu on the work of the fund and
expressed their willingness to play an active role in promoting
Sino-Japanese friendly relations and people-to-people contacts.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese guests arrived in Beijing yesterday for a work
meeting at the invitation of the China Association for
International Friendly Contacts.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-two outstanding
experts were today elected the country's first group of
academicians in engineering management.
</P>
<P>
Song Jian, president of the Chinese Academy of Engineering (
CAE), told reporters that these academicians were chosen because
of their excellent engineering management skills.
</P>
<P>
Among those elected are Xu Kuangdi, a metallurgist and mayor
of Shanghai, and Liu Jie, also a metallurgist and general manager
of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company.
</P>
<P>
The title was created in a bid to promote the awareness of the
significance of engineering management science among the country's
10 million engineering workers, said Song.
</P>
<P>
The modernization drive in the 21st century requires not only
improved engineering skills, but also research and experience in
engineering management, he said.

<P>
At present, China lags behind many other countries in
engineering management science and techniques, which has hindered
the development of the national economy, said Song.

scientific management," he added.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto's Body Guards Surrenders Weapons to Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Amid wide-spread accusation
and mounting pressure from the public, body guards of former
President Soeharto finally surrendered their firearms to the local
Jakarta police.
</P>
<P>
Antara news agency Monday quoted newly-appointed National
Police Chief Gen. S. Bimantoro as confirming that the number of
surrendered-guns was more than a hundred units. "But (to get
information on) the exact number, please ask the Director of
Intelligence," Bimantoro said.
</P>
<P>
The disarmament of firearms possessed by Soeharto's body guards
as well as his family members is in line with the President
Abdurrahman Wahid's call.
</P>
<P>
The president has ordered the police to disarm civilian body
guards of the sick 79- year-old man. Wahid even suggested that
Soeharto's bodyguards were behind the series of recent terror
actions including several bomb attacks in the capital.

<HEADLINE> WIPO Hosts Interactive Exhibition on Digital Music </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The World Intellectual
Property Organization (WIPO) inaugurated here Monday an
interactive exhibition on music in the digital age.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, which will be open to the public until August
2001, aims to show how digital technology and the internet are
transforming the process of creating, distributing, storing and
accessing music in today's on-line world, according to a WIPO
press release.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition takes the visitor through three critical stages
in the production and delivery of digital music: how it is created
and recorded, how it is disseminated, and how it is ultimately
enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition also examines how the use of these new
technologies is affecting intellectual property law and practice,
particularly in the field of copyright and related rights. These
rights safeguard the ability of artists, performers, and producers
of musical recordings to control and receive payment for their
musical works.
</P>
<P>
WIPO expressed the hope that the exhibition would send a
message to the public that the responsibility to respect the
rights of those who create, record, and publish music rests with
the listeners who enjoy it, although government agencies are
responsible for enforcement measures.

<HEADLINE> China to Set up National Social Security Foundation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- China has decided to
establish a national social security foundation, in a bid to
ensure necessary subsidies to those that have been laid-off and
those requiring financial aid.
</P>
<P>
At the crucial stage of China's State-owned enterprises (SOEs)
reform, the move aims to help perfect China's social security
system and create a stable social environment for the country's
reform and opening-up drive.
</P>
<P>
Approved by the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central
Committee, the State Council has decided to set up the national
social security foundation and a foundation council, with Liu
Zhongli, Vice Minister in charge of State Development and Planning
Commission, as the chairman of the board.
</P>
<P>
Since China's opening-up in 1978, the country has forged a
social security network focusing on the unemployed, the elderly
and those lacking basic living necessities.
</P>
<P>
Currently, China's social security funds primarily come from
old-age and medical insurance payments by township enterprise
workers and government functionaries, as well as payments
contributed by government organizations and enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The board of the foundation, affiliated to the State Council,
will be directly in charge of funds allocated from the central
government, of selecting and entrusting special assets management
companies and announcing the profits and capital flow volumes of
the foundation to the public.
</P>
<P>
The trustees of the foundation consist of social celebrities,
government functionaries, experts, scholars and enterprise
representatives which had been selected and appointed by the State
Council.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Turkish Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Turkish newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet:
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Justice Minister Hikmet Sami Turk said on Sunday that
legislative bodies in every country could not decide on historical
events.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the passage by a U.S. House subcommittee of a bill
over the alleged Armenian genocide, Turk said "The allegations in
this bill are biased and subjective."
</P>
<P>
He warned that if the U.S. Congress passes the bill, "Turkey
would not hesitate to take every necessary measure."
</P>
<P>
Milliyet:
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said on Sunday that
jerry-built houses collapsed in last year's earthquakes, showing
that "earthquake is a natural disaster but its consequences are not
natural."
</P>
<P>
Visiting Eskisehir province in central Anatolia, Ecevit said
that as the whole Turkey is situated on fault lines, it is
imperative to make geological and other researches for construction
of quake-resistant buildings.
</P>
<P>
Yenibinyil:
</P>
<P>
-- Members of 16 non-governmental organizations in Turkey's
southern Adana province staged a demonstration on Sunday in front
of the U.S. Consulate in Adana, protesting the approval of a bill
over the "Armenian Genocide" by a U.S. House subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators burned American products and Armenian national
flag. They issued a statement, saying that the approval deeply hurt
the Turkish people and calling on boycotting American products
like "Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Marlboro and Camel" in case of approval of
the bill by the U.S. House.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News:
</P>
<P>
-- Turkey is unlikely to embargo the U.S. over the "Armenian
Genocide" bill because the U.S. is the third largest investor in
Turkey with 3.04 billion U.S. dollars, next to France with 5.3
billion dollars and Germany with 3.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Also, the U.S. is Turkey's second biggest trading partner.
Turkey sent 11.2 percent of its total exports, namely 1.5 billion
dollars out of 13.4 billion dollars, to the U.S. in the first half
of this year, up 26.4 percent from the same period of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Deploy Another Army Battalion to Sabah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will soon
deploy one more army battalion to guard islands in Sabah waters
vulnerable to attacks by foreign armed intruders, Defense Minister
Najib Tun Razak said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Presently one battalion is upgrading surveillance in Sabah
waters and the army is making arrangement to send another in the
very near future, Najib said here at a press conference on the
latest security situation in Sabah, East Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Najib said the army reinforcements for strategic islands would
either be stationed on their own or combinedly with police
personnel.
</P>
<P>
Both the air force and navy would also intensify aerial and
maritime patrols and army and navy commandos would also be
deployed to the islands, he said, adding the navy would also
strengthen its fleet in Sabah waters from seven ships presently to
20 soon.
</P>
<P>
The first deployment came in the wake of the September 10
abduction of three Malaysians from Pandanan island by gunmen
established to be from southern Philippines and was in line with
the Cabinet's declaration that abduction by armed men in Malaysian
waters is a violation of Malaysia's territorial sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The September 10 incident was the second abduction within five
months staged by armed groups on resort islands off Sabah.
</P>
<P>
The first occurred on April 23 when 21 people (nine Malaysians
and 12 foreigners) were abducted from Sipadan island and held
hostage in Jolo in southern Philippines. All except one of the
hostages have been freed.
</P>
<P>
The three Malaysians abducted from Pandanan Island are also
reportedly being held in Jolo which is the target of a current
Philippine military offensive against rebel positions.

<HEADLINE> Uzbek Athletics Coach Fined for HGH Import </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 25 (Xinhua) -- A Sydney court Monday fined
Uzbekistan athletics coach Sergei Voynov 10,000 Australian dollars
(5,500 U.S. dollars) for importing banned Human Growth Hormone (
HGH) into Australia.
</P>
<P>
Voynov, 45, pleaded guilty to bringing in the prohibited import
on September 15.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors told the court Voynov was charged after customs
officers at Sydney's international airport found 15 vials of the
banned HGH in his baggage.
</P>
<P>
HGH is undetectable using current doping tests and, under
Australian laws, the 45-year-old Voynov faced a maximum fine of
100,000 Australian dollars or five years in jail.
</P>
<P>
His attorney, Clive Stern, told the court that Voynov was using
the drug to treat a skin disorder and that he did not know it was
banned.
</P>
<P>
Magistrate Kevin Maughan said the claim that an Olympic track
and field coach did not know HGH was illegal "flies in the face of
reality".
</P>
<P>
Voynov, who sat with an interpreter, did not speak during the
hour-long hearing but stood once and removed a blond wig to prove
to the magistrate that he was bald.
</P>
<P>
Uzbek National Olympic Committee president Sabuirjan Ruziev
said last week Voynov has a skin disorder called Alopecia capitis
totalis, or total baldness of the scalp, and had been treated with
the drug Somatotropine before coming to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
But prosecutors said that Voynov had brought a seven-week
supply of the drug to the Olympics, which last two weeks.

<P>
SYDNEY, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Michael Johnson retained his
400m gold medal at the 27th Olympic Games here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old American, who became the first runner to win a
200- and 400 meters gold double in Atlanta Olymic Games four years
ago, led all the way to win the title in 43.84 seconds, a far cry
from his world record of 43.18 set in last year's Seville World
Championships.
</P>
<P>
Johnson's fellow American Alvin Harrison took the silver in 44.
40 and Jamaica's Gregory Haughton won the bronze in his season
best time of 44.70.
</P>
<P>
Johnson had vowed to attempt to become the first man to run
under 43 seconds but a breeze sweeping through the stadium and an
overcast sky put that ambition on hold for another day.
</P>
<P>
"I just went out and did what I have been doing for the past
ten years and tonight feels just as good as the first time," said
Johnson after the race.
</P>
<P>
"It was tough. I felt the pressure on me. I didn't want to end
my Olympic career with a silver or a bronze," he said. "Obviously
being the first man to successfully defend the title means a lot
to me. I like being part of history."

CAIRO, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak

<HEADLINE> Philippine Military Asks for More Time to Crush Abu Sayyaf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manila, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Armed Forces Chief
of Staff Angelo Reyes on Monday asked for more time to crush the
Abu Sayyaf group, which is still holding 17 hostages including
four foreigners in Sulu province.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, Reyes said he accepted
full responsibility for the military's failure to meet its own
deadline of one week to wind up its operations against the
extremist group.
</P>
<P>
During the first 10 days of combat operations, government
forces killed 47 Abu Sayyaf rebels, based on body accounting, and
wounded six. However, intelligence's estimate put Abu Sayyaf
fatalities at 103.
</P>
<P>
Reyes confirmed that one of the leaders of the Abu Sayyaf group,
Radulan Sahiron, was seriously wounded during the attack by
government troops.
</P>
<P>
Government forces recovered 207 high-powered and two low-
powered firearms, Reyes said, adding that the military suffered
one killed and six wounded.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said four civilians were killed in the crossfire
since the military assaulted the Abu Sayyaf jungle hideouts in
Patikul, Taipao and Indanan towns, all in Sulu.
</P>
<P>
Reyes admitted that the military was "overly optimistic" that
it would rescue all the hostages and finish off the fleeing Abu
Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
"We perhaps had been overly optimistic in estimating how long
it would take us to bring in peace or recovering the hostages, the
problem is obviously now difficult than we anticipated and I
accept that responsibility," Reyes said.
</P>
<P>
"Please allow us to continue doing this job the best way we
know how," he added.
</P>
<P>
The military action against the Abu Sayyaf started on September
16 with simultaneous air and ground attack.
</P>
<P>
Four days after the military mounted its offensive, two French
journalists were able to escape from their Abu Sayyaf captors.
</P>
<P>
The on-going military operations have displaced 6,311 families
or 20,206 people, but various agencies of the government are
attending to them, other reports said.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Be Least Populous in East Africa Countries in 2025: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Kenya will become the
smallest of the three East African countries in terms of
population in 25 years, the Nairobi-based weekly East African
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2025, the population in Kenya will reach about 42
million from 28.7 million in 1999, the newspaper said, citing
statistics from the 2000 annual report by the U.N. Population Fund
released recently.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania, which overtook Kenya as the most populous east
African country in 1990, is expected to have a population of
nearly 58 million in 2025 while Uganda will have more than 44
million.
</P>
<P>
The population of Tanzania in 1999 was 31.3 million while that
of Uganda was 22.8 million.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. report attributed Kenya's relatively small population
to its low population growth rate of about 2 percent, well below
Uganda's 2.8 percent and Tanzania's 2.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Besides, contraception knowledge and use is also more
widespread in Kenya than in its two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
However, Uganda and Tanzania, with their HIV/AIDS prevalence
rates standing at 8.09 percent and 8.3 percent respectively, are
more successful on AIDS prevention and education than Kenya, whose
HIV/AIDS infection rate is about 14 percent.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Modernize Africa's Second Deepest Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania will spend 6
million U.S. dollars in modernizing the southern port of Mtwara,
the second deepest in Africa, newspapers here reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
A senior official of the Tanzania Harbors Authority (THA) was
quoted as saying that the port will be dredged and widened
especially at the entrance channel to facilitate handling of large
vessels.
</P>

"The port's capacity to handle cargo would more than double to
400,000 tons (per year) from 150,000 tons to meet the increased
traffic from neighboring countries," said THA Operations Director
John Kwayu.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania and its southern neighbors Mozambique, Malawi and
Zambia are currently in cooperation to invest in the Mtwara
Development Corridor in a bid to revitalize the less developed
region.

framework of the Southern Africa Development Community," he said.

Mtwara port was built between 1948 and 1954 to export
groundnuts in the southern regions of the then Tanganyika which
was under the western colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
The port has no tidal restrictions for vessels entering and
leaving the harbor, although there is an enforced length
restriction of 175 meters due to the shape of the channel.
</P>
<P>
THA plans to increase the port's capacity to accommodate more
than six vessels of this size in the inner bay by removing
numerous shoals in the exits.
</P>
<P>
"The dredging will also reduce the transit time and permit
easier movement of ships at any time of the day, regardless of
tide," Kwayu said.
</P>
<P>
He said Mtwara is expected to become a free port.

<HEADLINE> Inter-Korean Economic Cooperation Talks Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The inter-Korean working-level
economic cooperation, the first of its kind, began here Monday,
with the focus on issues of investment guarantee and double
taxation avoidance.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the two-day talks, the South Korean
delegation presented draft agreements on four issues -- investment
protection, dual tax avoidance, dispute settlement and open
accounts -- while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
counterpart submitted draft agreements on two issues for
discussion.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed that it is necessary to reach an accord on
all the four issues, said Lee Kun-kyong, vice minister of Finance
and Economy, who is heading the South Korean delegation. But due
to time limit, Lee added, the two sides decided to concentrate on
two of them.
</P>
<P>
"We need to look into the proposal submitted by the North," Lee
said. "But we believe they were drafted based on both
international practices and similar sensibility based on our
shared ethnic background. There are much common grounds shared by
both sides."
</P>
<P>
The DPRK delegation, led by Jong Un-op, chairman of the DPRK
National Economic Cooperation Federation, flew to Seoul Sunday
afernoon for the two-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing talks are held in accordance with an agreement
reached by Kim Yung Sun, special envoy of DPRK leader Kim Jong Il
and his South Korean counterpart Lim Dong-won in Cheju, South
Korea, in mid-September.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Close Higher in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices closed higher in
Tokyo Monday as investors were encouraged to buy shares after the
Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized countries moved to support the
euro and combat high oil prices over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose 174.65 points, or 1.10
percent from last Friday's to close at 15,992.90.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, added 11.31 points or 0.77 percent to 1,478.
24.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section decreased to 439.17 million
shares from last Friday's 535.12 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Alps Electric was the day's volume leader.
</P>
<P>
Joint intervention last weekend by G-7 nations to support the
euro, combined with a U.S. decision to release 30 million barrels
of oil from its strategic petroleum reserves to combat oil price
surges, have made investors feel good about buying stocks, traders
said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese yen's weakness against the U.S. dollar also
boosted share prices, particularly those of exporters, they said.
</P>
<P>
The chemical, drug and wholesale sectors made sharp gains,
while the oil, mining and brokerage industries moved down.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, gainers outnumbered
losers 796 to 480, with 143 issues closing unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Survey on South China Tigers Living In The Wild </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, September 25 (Xinhua) -- China will carry out surveys
on species of South China Tigers living in the wild in southern
Chinese provinces Jiangxi, Fujian, Hunan, Guangdong and Zhejiang
from late autumn to early winter.
</P>
<P>
Sources at a recent symposium on the surveys held in Nanchang,
the provincial capital of Jiangxi, said the State Forestry
Administration of China would cooperate with the World Wildlife
Fund (WWF) which will focus on general features regarding the
tiger living in the wild, including its number, distribution, as
well as counter measures to protect this endangered species.
</P>
<P>
The South China Tiger is listed as one of the 10 most
endangered species in the world and is under State protection in
China. It is estimated that there are some 20 to 30 South China
Tigers living in the wild. Another 59 are in captivity around the
country.
</P>
<P>
Although there have been traces of South China Tigers in many
places in east China's Jiangxi and Zhejiang provinces, no hard
evidence has been found to confirm this.
</P>
<P>
According to the symposium, infra-red positioning photographic
equipment will be used in the survey.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen to Invest 380 Billion Yuan in Fixed Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, September 25 (Xinhua) -- China's first special
economic zone, Shenzhen, in south China's Guangdong Province
bordering Hong Kong will pump 380 billion yuan (about 45.78
billion U.S. dollars) into fixed assets projects over the next
five years.
</P>
<P>
A local official who has participated in drafting Shenzhen's
development plan for 2001-2005 disclosed that the investment will
go for high-tech and environmental protection industry projects,
port service facilities, urban civil works, and affordable housing
projects.
</P>
<P>
The official said 15 percent of the total spending will be
covered by overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
So more methods will be used to raise capital overseas and
greater efforts will be made to encourage overseas investors to
invest in profitable basic and public works, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen used to be a small border town. Earthshaking changes
have taken place since it became a special economic zone on August
26, 1980. Over the past two decades, it has invested 292.2 billion
yuan (about 35.2 billion U.S. dollars) in fixed assets.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen has become a regional transportation hub and the
country's largest land port of entry and exit. The area of the
city has expanded to 320 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The city has set a goal to lead the nation in modernization by
the year of 2005.

<HEADLINE> Massive Investment in Infrastructure to Reinforce Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- China will be able to meet
the target of the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000) to
invest 13 trillion yuan in fixed assets by the end of this year,
according to an official from the State Development Planning
Commission.
</P>
<P>
The central government has decided to issue another 50 billion
yuan in long-term treasury bonds during the second half of the
year, the latest effort to further improve infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the five-year period, the government
adopted a moderately tight fiscal policy. However, the Asian
financial crisis in later years exerted a negative impact on China
's economic performance. So, in 1998, China turned to a proactive
financial policy, instead.
</P>
<P>
The most important of the measures the central government took
is to issue long-term T-bonds in a move to boost construction of
infrastructure and stimulate domestic demand, the official said.
</P>
<P>
By now, the government has issued 360 billion yuan of T-bonds,
leading to a total investment of 1.5 trillion yuan from banks and
the society as a whole.
</P>
<P>
T-bond issuance helped contribute 1.5 percentage points to GDP
growth in 1998, about two percentage points in 1999, and will also
boost the national economic development this year, according to
the official.
</P>
<P>
More important, the government has done many matters of great
significance that it couldn't afford to do for a long time.
</P>
<P>
Over the past four years, the government injected 722.4 billion
yuan into 129 state key projects, involving power, transportation,
telecommunications, and petrochemicals.
</P>
<P>
Investment in the Three Gorges Dam Project, for example,
totaled 65.16 billion yuan by June, and at some sections of the
dam, cement casting has reached the designed height of 185 meters.
</P>
<P>
Another example is the 300-billion-yuan west-east natural gas
pipeline project, which was started early this year at a time when
the central government began to shift its development strategy
westward.
</P>
<P>
Increased input in infrastructure has not only helped maintain
synchronous growth of fixed assets investment and overall economic
development, but also avoided redundant construction by giving
priority to basic and pillar industries.

<HEADLINE> Agricultural Bank Increases Housing Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Agricultural Bank of
China (ABC), one of the country's four big state banks, increased
housing loans by 79.8 percent or 12.39 billion yuan from January
to August this year.
</P>
<P>
Shang Fulin, president of the ABC, said today by the end of
August, outstanding housing loans granted by the ABC had reached
54.42 billion yuan, and individual housing loans reached 27.92
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
According to Shang, the bank readjusted its lending policy this
year, giving more focus to the housing sector. The bank is set to
increase its housing loans to 10 percent of its total loans by
2004.
</P>
<P>
Up till now, the ABC has provided 19 kind of loans in 10
categories to urban and rural residents, with the longest lending
period of 30 years and the largest sum of up to 80 percent of the
full amount.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the ABC has recently launched a new program to
increase lending to small towns in China's rural areas to help
facilitate the urbanization process. The new program will allow
farmers to migrate into towns and earn "stable incomes" before
applying for housing loans.
</P>
<P>
China's housing sector has developed at a fast pace since the
country introduced pro-fiscal policies to stimulate consumption.
Latest figures indicate that from January to August, the country
invested 166.8 billion yuan in the housing sector, up 29 percent
from the same period last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, September 25 (Xinhua)-- With the adoption of reforms
and the opening up policy in China, Nanjing, the capital city of
east China's Jiangsu Province, like many other major Chinese
cities, started to increase its contact and cooperation with
foreign metropolises more than two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
After the signing of the Sino-Japanese Peace and Friendship
Treaty in December, 1978, Nanjing and Nagoya of Japan became the
first pair of sister cities between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The next year, Nanjing and St. Louis of the U.S. forged
friendship relations, becoming the first pair of sister cities
between China and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Now, the Chinese city has established friendship with 11 cities
from the five continents of the world, such as Florence of Italy,
Leipzig of Germany, Mexicali of Mexico, and Taejon of the Republic
of Korea.
</P>
<P>
Tourists from Japan have been swarming to Nanjing since the
city set up friendship relations with Nagoya. The two cities also
jointly built a hotel in Nanjing to accommodate Japanese tourists.
</P>
<P>
Group visits between the cities have been frequent over the
years. A children art troupe consisting from Nanjing has visited
Nagoya four times and have been praised by the Japanese people as
"cultural angels" and "cultural ambassadors".
</P>
<P>
During the past few years, people in Nagoya have launched a
campaign to renovate the ancient city walls in Nanjing, and as
many as 20,000 Japanese people have come to Nanjing for the labor.
</P>
<P>
Visiting the memorial hall for Chinese nationals, who died in
the massacre committed by Japanese invaders during the World War
Two, has become a must for many Japanese visitors to Nanjing.
</P>
<P>
Every year since 1978, a delegation from Nagoya has come to
Nanjing for tree-planting. Now the one-hundred mu (about 6.7
hectares) "Japanese Orchard" in the Zhenzhuyuan Park has been
completed.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt Set Deadline For E. Timor Militias to Hand Over Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government set
Wednesday (September 27) as deadline for East Timorese militiamen
to surrender all their weapons, Coordinating Minister for
Political, Social and Security Affairs Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono
said.
</P>
<P>
"We expect some 100 standard military guns (among the weapons
to be surrendered)," he told reporters after meeting with
President Abdurrahman Wahid at the Merdeka Palace here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that the government wants the East Timorese
militiamen to hand over their weapons voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
Due to the difficulty of disseminating information to the
militiamen, the government decided to give them three more days
from September 25 to 27, he said, adding that starting September
28, a massive operation to confiscate the weapons as well as legal
action will be carried out.
</P>
<P>
Yudhoyono also reminded East Timorese leader Xanana Gusmao and
head of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East
Timor (UNTAET) Sergio de Mello on the importance of reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Jakarta East Timorese should no longer commit violence
that could disturb Indonesia's relations with the international
community, he said, adding that they should also be treated well.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that East Timor militias in Atambua, East Nusa
Tenggara province, officially began handing in their weapons on
Sunday. Two piles of firearms were neatly stacked in a well-
arranged ceremony in the border town.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Megawati Soekarnoputri arrived in Atambua on
Sunday to briefly examine the stacks of weapons, mostly home-made
rifles.
</P>
<P>
The government's action to disarm came amid international
pressure following the killing of three United Nations workers by
a mob which stormed the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
office in Atambua earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The attack was reportedly sparked by the murder of former
militia leader Olivio Moruk.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Development Bank Criticized for Getting Coffee Industry in Hitch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Coffee Growers
Association (ZCGA) has criticized the Development Bank of Zambia (
DBZ) for mishandling an 18 million U.S. dollars World Bank fund
for coffee projects in the country, the Times of Zambia newspaper
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
DBZ failed to recover between 11 and 15 million dollars it
loaned out to farmers and the coffee industry has been greatly
affected as there is no revolving fund to sustain any programs in
the field, ZCGA general manager Joseph Taguma was quoted as saying
here in an interview on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said the industry has been further hit by a depressed market
dropping from 120 cents per pound to 80 cents per pound, largely
due to an over-production of coffee by Brazil, Mexico, Columbia
and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Although Zambia is expected to increase its coffee production
to 5,000 tons this year from last year's 3,000 tons, it would face
stiff competition from Brazil whose coffee production has
increased from 26 million to 35 million bags, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Taguma, the association is currently soliciting 3
to 7 million dollars from the government to make the industry
viable.

<HEADLINE> (Specially for China-Africa Cooperation Forum) Interview: China-Africa Cooperation Forum to Promote Understanding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Zhao Yi
</P>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The forthcoming China-
Africa Cooperation Forum scheduled for October 10-12 in Beijing,
China, is a great initiative to promote mutual understanding and
economic cooperation between China and African countries, a
senior Ethiopian official has said.
</P>
<P>
The forum will be a reflection of the long-standing friendship
and brotherly relations between the peoples of China and Africa,
said Vice Minister of Economic Development and Cooperation Mulatu
Teshome in an interview with Xinhua recently.
</P>
<P>
Mulatu, 43, is one of the few Ethiopian government officials
who are familiar with China, and speaks fluent Chinese. He majored
in philosophy and international politics when he was a student in
Beijing in 1976.
</P>
<P>
"I studied in China for 10 years and got the Doctor of
Philosophy," Mulatu introduced himself proudly.
</P>
<P>
As an expert on China, Mulatu applauded the great success that
China has achieved in the implementation of reform and opening
policy for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's rapid development has proved that
developing countries could turn out to be developed if they pursue
right policies.
</P>
<P>
"China, a developing country and the most populous nation in
the world, is the hope of other developing countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that the first ever China-Africa
Cooperation Forum will breathe new life into the existing friendly
relations between the two sides, and their sustained and close
political ties will lay solid foundation for bilateral economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China has always been on the side of the African people during
their struggle for liberation and construction, while governments
of African countries are also giving their support to the one-
China policy in the international arena.
</P>
<P>
"This long-standing political relations and excellent
friendship can be backed up with specific cooperation in trade and
industrial areas," Mulatu said, adding that Africa has a big
market and is rich in diversified resources, thus making it
attractive to investors.
</P>
<P>
Mulatu said that the forthcoming forum will provide Ethiopia
with an opportunity to express its views on issues of concern to
itself and to Africans in general, like regional conflicts,
poverty, debts and unbalanced trade.
</P>
<P>
He said Ethiopia and China have been enjoying good relations
since the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1970. "We
share common positions on most international affairs. We have been
extending principled support to the one-China policy while China
has been assisting Ethiopia in many areas."
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of the 33.49-kilometer Addis Ababa Ring Road
project which is being constructed by the Chinese Road and Bridge
Corporation. The bigger part of the road is due to be operational
at the end of 2001.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Chinese companies are involved in the management of
Ethiopian textile factories in addition to road, hydropower and
natural gas projects.
</P>
<P>
"We want to see more Chinese enterprises coming to our country
to introduce their know-how because we want to have our natural
resources converted into products," he said.

<HEADLINE> Shortage of Food Continues in DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Food supplied will
continuously fall short in the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK) next year, due to serious damage in agricultural
sector caused by this year's drought, heat and typhoon, said a
statement issued here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Compared with an average year, said the statement issued by the
Ministry of Agriculture of the DPRK, rainfall in the rural areas
during the sowing season of rice and maize this year dropped by 40-
50 percent. And worse still, it rained little in some rural areas
for 40-50 days. Rice and maize are main crops in DPRK.
</P>
<P>
As a result, rice transplanting across the country was delayed
by one month or more and even canceled in some areas, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Because of serious drought and abnormal high temperature that
continued till mid-August, some paddy fields dried up. Rice roots
rotted and maize withered.
</P>
<P>
The output of rice and maize this year is expected to cut by
over one million tons, or rice output down by 360,000 tons and
maize output by 660,000 tons, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
During the harvesting time, two strong typhoons swept across
some 140,000 hectares of farmland, including 46,000 hectares of
paddy fields, further worsening the agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
Grain output, said the statement, will be cut down by more than
1.4 million tons due to serious natural disasters this year.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK government is now taking practical measures to ensure
food supplies to the people in disaster-hit areas, said the
statement.

telecommunications, foreign trade, and transportation sectors.
</P>
<P>
The policy also encourages overseas investors to fund
enterprises in the tourism, education, medical treatment and other
service sectors in Chongqing.

The policy also offers overseas investors preferential
treatment in terms of taxation, financial management, real estate,
cargo import and export, investment mode, registration, exit and

<HEADLINE> Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Warming Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in
western China is warming up gradually, according to the Qinghai
Provincial Meteorological Bureau.
</P>
<P>
A report about the climatic changes on the plateau in the past
40 years says that the temperature on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
rose by an average 0.16 degrees Celsius per decade, compared with
the fact that the world's average temperature only went up by 0.7
degrees Celsius in the last 100 years.
</P>
<P>
The bureau found that the annual average rainfall in the region
has also reduced since the beginning of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Lusheng, a senior engineer with the bureau, said that the
warming up of the plateau has led to the shrinking of glacier,
water sources for rivers, drying up of lakes and fast
desertification in the region since the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
Shi Yafeng, an academician with the China Academy of Sciences,
predicted that a significant climatic change is expected on the
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Shi explained, the International Intergovernmental Committee
for Climatic Changes forecasts that the world's average
temperature will be one to 3.5 degrees Celsius higher by the end
of the 21st century, compared with the end of the 20th century.
The average temperature on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau will be 3
degrees Celsius higher than at the end of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
Shi cited excessive herding, damages to the natural grassland
and forest as well as desertification as the factors which will
seriously affect the climate on the plateau.
</P>
<P>
Shi suggested that construction of infrastructure facilities in
the region be carried out to protect the local environment and
ecology.

<HEADLINE> Mosques, Churches to Be Removed From Three Gorges Reservoir Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is
helping people with various religious beliefs remove from the city
more than 30 mosques, churches and temples from the Three Gorges
Reservoir area, officials said.
</P>
<P>
And despite the process all religious activities are still
going smoothly and orderly in the area, they added.
</P>
<P>
Li Imam still brings dozens of Muslims to conduct their
religious activities during the Day of Jumah at a mosque in
Wanzhou District of Chongqing municipality. The 100-year-old
mosque will be flooded within the next two years.
</P>
<P>
A new mosque will be built next year in the central part of a
new city which houses resettled residents from the Three Gorges
Area, local sources said.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing massive Three Gorges Project involves the
relocation of over one million people and 100,000 buildings,
including 30 religious buildings.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has set up a special organ to oversee
the relocation and earmarked 10 million yuan for the construction
of new religious buildings for more than 150,000 religious
believers in the area.
</P>
<P>
The government has consistently advocated the freedom of belief,
and at the same time, religious people are also encouraged to
participate in the country's construction.
</P>
<P>
Jia Zaiyun, an official in charge of religious affairs in
Wanzhou, said that the government has helped selecting locations
for religious buildings and leasing land, and all taxes involved
have been exempted.
</P>
<P>
Li Imam said that the new mosque not only will be built in the
Islamic architectural style, but will also be seven times bigger
than the original one.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing has 80 percent of the area that will be submerged by
the Three Gorges Reservoir when it is completed around 2009. Of
the 30 religious buildings 20 will be moved out from Chongqing.
They include four mosques, seven Catholic churches, five Christian
churches and four Buddhist temples.
</P>
<P>
More churches will be built so that followers of the different
religions living on both sides of the Yangtze River can easily
conduct their religious activities.
</P>
<P>
The State Administration of Religious Affairs has mobilized
religious institutions across the country to support the
relocation of religious buildings in the Three Gorges Area.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a special organization has been set up to monitor
the use of the donated funds for the relocation, which will be
completed in two years.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Sees Increasing Exports to ASEAN Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand has seen
increasing exports to the ASEAN countries, according to the latest
issue of New Zealand Export News.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures show that New Zealand exports lifted 23
percent to 1,934 million NZ dollars (800 million U.S. dollars) in
the year from July 1999 to June 2000.
</P>
<P>
Food and beverages (especially processed and branded products),
pulp, timber, and paper exports were increasing strongly across
the region. Some types of manufactured exports were also doing
well in some markets.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted New Zealand's Senior Trade Commissioner
for South East Asia John Nicholson as saying: "Exports to Malaysia,
Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam are now well above pre-
crash (financial crisis in Asia) levels."
</P>
<P>
ASEAN growth rates are a further positive signal to New Zealand
companies looking to supply products and services to the region,
he added.
</P>
<P>
"Growth rates for 2000 range from 3.8 percent in the
Philippines to 8.1 percent for Malaysia, with Thailand on 5.2
percent and Singapore tipped to come in at about 7 percent. The
outlook for 2001 is also very bright," Nicholson said.
</P>
<P>
"We are unlikely to see growth return to the halcyon days of
the early 1990s, but the foundations are being laid for future
prosperity," he said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Vice President Warns White Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Vice President
Joseph Msika Sunday warned white farmers over their attempts to
derail the fast-track resettlement program through courts.
</P>
<P>
He also slammed some young Zimbabweans for supporting the
opposition Movement for Democratic Change, saying the leadership
of the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (
Zanu-pf) would not be pushed out of power before fulfilling its
mandate.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a mass meeting in Bindura of north Zimbabwe, Msika
said those farmers seeking to deter the resettlement program would
lose out and the National Land Redistribution Committee would make
sure that every farmer is left with one farm.
</P>
<P>
The National Land Redistribution Committee plans to get about 5
million hectares of land for redistribution to landless
Zimbabweans.
</P>
<P>
Msika, also chairman of the committee, said "this country has
no place for greedy people who feel they should have it alone. We
should share the national cake."
</P>
<P>
According to the vice president, he is surprised to learn some
youths are demanding the immediate removal of Zanu-pf from power
when the economy is being plundered by whites.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody should push the leadership out, especially President
Robert Mugabe," he said. "If you are fooled and push us out, then
a puppet will be installed who will pander to the whims of the
minority and not the majority."

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Leads in Presidential Vote: Ruling Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic led his opposition rival Vojislav Kostunica in the early
results of the presidential election here, said the latest
statistics of the ruling Socialist party (SPS) on Monday. But
neither of them got the support of half of the voters.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Nikola Sainovic, also a top
official of the SPS, told a press conference in the small hours on
Monday that Milosevic had bagged 44 percent of the 940,453 votes
counted so far, while Kostunica garnered 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
"We can say that our candidate leads ... in the first round,"
Sainovic told reporters.
</P>
<P>
However, the Yugoslav opposition claimed early Monday that
their candidate Kostunica was holding a commanding lead over
Milosevic with 45 percent of the votes counted.
</P>
<P>
Cedomir Jovanovic, senior official of the Democratic Opposition
of Serbia (DOS), told reporters that Kostunica netted 57 percent
of the votes cast on Sunday, according to the partial, unofficial
estimates.
</P>
<P>
According to the Center for Free Elections and Democracy (CESID)
, an independent Serbian poll monitoring organization close to the
opposition, the turnout was 78 percent of the 7.8 million
registered voters in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Under Yugoslav election law, any presidential candidate can win
if he gets half of the ballots in the first round of the polls. If
no runners meet the standard, the two who obtained the most will
hold a second round of voting, and the leader in the voting will
become president.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Plans to Donate Eyes to UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lanka Eye Donation
Society has agreed to supply corneas for the benefit of blind
patients in Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates (UAE),
at the request of UAE's Ambassador in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
R. Athukorale, President of the society, said Monday that the
UAE Ambassador was willing to facilitate the project by funding
the international program and also meet the cost of the air
passage.
</P>
<P>
The eyes will be sent to the blind patients at the Al Jazeema
Hospital in Abu Dhabi within the next two months.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lanka Eye Donation society was founded by Dr Hudson
Silva to initially supply cornea for implant in the eyes of blind
Sri Lankans. Later the International Eye Bank was set up with
Japanese assistance and so far 42,000 eyes have been supplied for
people in 168 cities in the world.
</P>
<P>
Athukorale said that at present the society had embarked on a
program to encourage the donation of eyes in remote areas through
its 300 branches scattered islandwide.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankans at all levels donate their eyes to the society at
death. A cornea of former Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake was
implanted in the eye of a Nigerian farmer and a Japanese woman
sees through the eyes of former President J. R. Jayewardene.
</P>
<P>
Recently the society opened a tissue bank to supply other parts
of the body for transplant.

<HEADLINE> Kumaratunga: Professionals Play Vital Role in Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President
Chandrika stressed the vital role the country's professionals have
to play in the development of the small island on the Indian Ocean,
according to local media Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Organization of Professional Associations,
Kumaratunga said the government was always ready to hear what they
had to say as it was a prerequisite for policy planning and
successful policy implementation for the betterment of the society.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga added that the government had not ignored the
professional community but had freed them from political
interference to enable them to make their contribution
independently.
</P>
<P>
She noted that the contribution made by professionals was
immensely helpful to achieve development goals. There was a gap
regarding the facilities between the private sector professional
and those in the state sector. She had provided money from the
President's Fund to provide facilities for state sector
professionals.
</P>
<P>
She said the government had concentrated on infrastructure
development in rural areas to extend industry to the periphery. It
had also made all possible efforts to strengthen the economy and
provide relief to people while fighting an expensive 17-year war
against the separatist Tamil Tiger rebels in the north of the
country.
</P>
<P>
She said concrete measures had also been taken to address the
minority problem and offer a political solution through
constitutional reforms. Over 55 percent of the majority Sinhala
community were supporting these reforms, she added.
</P>
<P>
Many professionals had contributed to the new educational
reforms under implementation throughout the country. Several
international schools that were opened were doing well and soon
private universities will also be allowed to take new strides in
higher education, she said.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga invited professionals to a development forum to
present their views on the government's national rebuilding
efforts.

BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The following is a round-up
of China's archaeology news for the past week:
</P>
<P>
-- Origin of Chinese Palaces Found
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists recently declared that they have found
the origin of Chinese palaces in a Neolithic site.
</P>
<P>
Removing two-meter thick of earth accumulation, archaeologists
unearthed the ruin of a 5,000-year-old building in Qin'an county
in west China's Gansu Province, which was estimated as an ancestor
of Chinese palaces.
</P>

people can still tell its splendor from the main pillars,
measuring 80 centimeters in diameter, and the thick and solid
walls remained.
</P>

Droughts
</P>
<P>
Many of the 3,000-year-old inscriptions on bones and tortoise
shells of the Shang Dynasty (16th century to 11th century B.C.)
unearthed in China were found to be related to the most dry period
of the past six millennia in northern China, an expert said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Yetang, a research fellow with the Chinese Academy of
Sciences (CAS), explained that about 3,000 years ago, when the
characters were widely used, dry condition might have exerted such
great influence on ancient agriculture and social life that even
many of the inscriptions were devoted to divination and praying
for rain.
</P>
<P>
-- China Stresses Protection of Relics in Western Areas
</P>
<P>
China's relics authorities stressed that the western areas
must plan comprehensive projects for safeguarding heritage and use
more advanced technologies in relics protection.
</P>

Heritage (SACH), said that while carrying out westward development
projects, the western areas must pay great attention to sustained
development and cultural relics preservation.
</P>

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Michael Schumacher took an
eight-point lead in the drivers' championship when he led home a
Ferrari one-two at the U.S. Grand Prix in Indianapolis on Sunday.

World champion Mika Hakkinen was forced to retire with engine
failure.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian Rubens Barrichello finished second, just under 13

On the seventh lap Schumacher overtook Coulthard at the end of
the straight. Coulthard then had to serve a 10-second stop-go
penalty for his false start by jumping the lights.

Schumacher won his 42nd career victory, to pull ahead of the
late legendary Brazilian driver Ayrton Senna.

The two projects will be constructed in Xianfeng Coal Mine in
Yunnan, southwest China, and Shenfu Coal Mine in Shaanxi,
northwest China. Costing a combined total of 20 billion yuan (
about 2.4 billion U.S. dollars), the two projects can produce two
million tons of petroleum annually.
</P>
<P>
Xianfeng Coal Mine, the first mine in China to experiment with
liquefying coal into oil, has a wood-coal reserve of 292 million
tons.
</P>
<P>
The project can produce 883,000 tons of petroleum, diesel oil
and other sideline products annually. Calculating based on the
current coal and oil prices, the project can earn an annual sales
income of 3.4 billion yuan. The total cost of the project can be
recovered in six years.
</P>
<P>
China has been importing oil since 1993. It will import more
than 70 million tons of oil this year, and by 2010, the amount
will be 100 million tons. However, China is rich in coal resources.
The proven reserve of coal is one trillion tons and its annual
output is one billion tons.

<HEADLINE> Bengal Tiger Relieved from Toothache on China's Tooth-Care Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 25 (Xinhua) -- On China Tooth-Care Day, a 6-
year-old Bengal tiger in the Shanghai Zoo had her old tooth, which
had agonized her for two years, replaced with an artificial false
tooth and she can now gnaw on bones again.
</P>
<P>
"Xiao Meng," the name of the tiger, broke one of her canine
teeth at the age of three. Not long after, a bacteria infection
induced pulpitis, which led to necrosis of the tiger's mandible.
An 8 centimeter-long hole was left in her mouth.
</P>
<P>
The complicated operation was successfully conducted on the
tooth-care day by 12 doctors and nurses from the Shanghai Xuhui
District Tooth Care Clinic.
</P>
<P>
Xiao Meng was very nervous roaring incessantly when she first
saw the operating bed. She soon went into a deep sleep after she
was given an anesthetic.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Shen Jiewen, the chief dentist, cleaned the hole in Xiao
Meng's mouth and filled it with artificial bone powders, a
macromolecule active material imported from the United States. The
tooth filler is also widely used in human dental surgery.
</P>
<P>
Having stitched the wound, doctors put a tooth sheath on the
false tooth. The cast-iron sheath made using the country's most
advanced techniques enables Xiao Meng to chew bones again.
</P>
<P>
The clinic has performed dental surgeries on many animals in
the zoo, like leopards, elephants, giraffes, gorillas and
kangaroos. It is negotiating with the zoo to set up an "Animal
Tooth Care Center."

<HEADLINE> More Chinese Models to Speak for Fashion Brands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, September 25 (Xinhua) -- More Chinese professional
models should strive to get endorsement contracts with clothing
brands rather than merely take part in fashion shows, said a
senior fashion industry insider at the First China Models Contest
which started its final competition recently here in Chengdu.
</P>
<P>
Wang Qing, chairman of China Garment Association, said that
very few Chinese models can see themselves as endorsing different
clothing brands.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that in order to achieve the goal, models should
equip themselves with more knowledge and understanding of culture
and art.
</P>
<P>
The selection of models in China is mainly through market
channels, which has neglected the educational background of the
models, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that winners of this contest become part of elite
commercial model troops.
</P>
<P>
China now has over 130 modeling agencies with 4,000 to 5,000
professional models.

<P>
The 18 holes scatter on a 3,334-meter course with a designed
par at 71.

<P>
Westwood scored 65, 69, 67 and 65 for his winning total of 266
while Eduardo Romero of Argentina came from behind to score five
one under on Sunday to get into the second place on 270.
</P>
<P>
Overnight leader Padraig Harrington from Ireland had to settle
for the third place with Tom Gillis of the United States, both
with 271 shots. The Irish golfer could have fared worse after he
shot one over par in two of the first three holes of the day.
</P>
<P>
"Hit two perfect shots on the first and third over the pin and
ended up bogeying both of them," said Harrington. "That's a bad
start and you are on the back foot from there on."
</P>
<P>
But the Irish pulled himself back by scoring two one under in
the sixth and 12th holes to share the third place with the
American.
</P>
<P>
"This is my second win here in three years," said Westwood
after the competition. "It was good but I could have gone a bit
lower. Today's was my best performance since the Scandinavian
Open and I will keep on working to make myself better for the
World Cup."
</P>
<P>
A field of 83 golfers participated in the four-day event before
moving on to compete in the German Masters scheduled for the
coming weekend.
</P>
<P>
The World Cup, hailed as the grand finale of the year-long tour
competition, will be held in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Rejects Pressure on Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Egypt rejects any attempts aimed
at isolating and putting pressure on Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and the claims that he lacks flexibility, Foreign Minister
Amr Moussa said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Arafat is flexible enough and has proposed serious ideas
regarding security and sovereignty over Jerusalem," Moussa told a
meeting of the Arab-German Chamber of Commerce and Industry, also
attended by ambassadors of European Union members in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
"The ball is now in the Israeli court, not in the Palestinian
court," Moussa said, calling for Israeli positive response to the
Palestinian legitimate demands on issues including Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israel must withdraw from East Jerusalem for the Palestinians to
establish an independent state with the holy city as the capital,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the United States have blamed the failure of the Camp
David summit in July on Arafat's inflexibility.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem is the major stumbling block in the Palestinian-
Israeli peace talks. Israel occupied Arab East Jerusalem in the
1967 Mideast War and declared later it as its "eternal and
undivided capital," a claim not recognized by the international
community.
</P>
<P>
Moussa, meanwhile, said there is still a possibility to reach a
peace agreement in the coming four weeks if the parties concerned,
especially Israel, are serious.
</P>
<P>
However, the Arabs will not accept an agreement that is not
based on the the United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 and
the land-for-peace principle, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Time is running short for the Mideast peace process as the
Israeli parliament, which is considering to topple Prime Minister
Ehud Barak's minority government, will reconvene by the end of
October after the summer recess. And the U.S., the major sponsor of
the peace process, will hold presidential elections on November 7.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Has No Intention to Invade Kuwait: Senior Official EDS-2nd lead-writethru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 25 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iraqi official said
here Monday evening that Iraq has no intention to take military
actions against Kuwait or any other country.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time the Iraqi government made such an
announcement, amid rising tensions between Iraq and Kuwait in
recent days due to what Kuwait accused as Baghdad's threat of
invasion.
</P>
<P>
"I assure you that we have no intention of taking a military
action against Kuwait or any other state," said Iraqi Minister of
Culture and Information Humam Abd Al-Khaliq Abd Al-Ghafur in a
press conference Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has made the position very clear "many years ago" that it
is willing to talk with all Arab states, the minister said, but
accused that it is Saudi Arabia and Kuwait that have refused to
talk to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq does not want to seek enmity with any country except the
Zionism (Israel), which occupies the land of Palestine, he said.
</P>
<P>
The statement seemed intended to clarify a speech made by
President Saddam Hussein earlier Monday in which he accused Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait of committing a "crime" by allowing the United
States and Britain to use military bases in their territories to "
kill Iraqi people and destroy their houses."
</P>
<P>
Saddam made the speech during a cabinet meeting he chaired on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi minister stressed that the speech is not a threat to
Kuwait. "It is an assessment of existing reality, a statement of
facts and that is how the talk should be understood," he said.
</P>
<P>
The tense relations between Iraq and Kuwait have further
strained since Iraq accused Kuwait on September 14 of stealing its
oil near the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border and threatened to "take necessary
measures."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait denied it was doing anything more than taking oil from
its own territory and accused Baghdad, whose 1990 invasion of
Kuwait led to the Gulf War, of trying to trigger a new regional
war.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Iraq has repeatedly accused Kuwait and Saudi Arabia of
being "full culprits" by collaborating with the U.S. and Britain to
attack Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait allow the U.S. and Britain to use their
bases to monitor the southern no-fly zone in Iraq, imposed by the
Western allies after the 1991 Gulf War triggered by Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led allies also use a base in Turkey to monitor another
no-fly zone in northern Iraq.

TEHRAN -- Iran's presidential office on Monday denied reports
that pro-reform Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance Ataollah
Mohajerani has resigned.

<P>
The minister, a close ally of reform-minded President Mohammad
Khatami, has resigned and his resignation has been accepted by the
president, the conservative-controlled Islamic Republic of Iran
Broadcasting (IRIB) reported Monday.
</P>

The threat was circulated in a pamphlet in the city of Tripoli,
75 kilometers north of Beirut, at the weekend. It demanded that the

JERUSALEM -- An Israeli parliamentary committee Monday endorsed

with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The amendment bill, authored by legislator Yehoshua Matza from
the right-wing opposition Likud, will require the support of an
absolute majority, or 61 members, in the 120-seat Knesset, to
change Jerusalem's municipal borders or transfer any state or
municipal authorities in the city to a non-Israeli entity.

LUSAKA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's Tourism Minister
Anoshi Chipawa Monday urged his country's tourist sector to be
more technology-orinented, to adapt to a changing tide in the
industry worldwide.
</P>
<P>
"What I can visualize is that the tourist establishment of the
future will be a communication center that goes beyond faxes and
phones," said the minister when launching the world tourism week
here.
</P>
<P>
He called up tourist agencies to use the internet to better
market potentials of the country's tourist resources.
</P>
<P>
A total of 581,000 tourists visited the country in 1999,
representing a 22.9 percent increase from that of 472,000 in 1998.
Accordingly, the revenue from tourist industry in Zambia also
increased to 85 million U.S. dollars in 1999 from 75 million
dollars in 1998, according to the minister.

<HEADLINE> UN Tribunal Opens Information Center in Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The International
Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) Monday opened an Information
and Documentation Center in Kigali, capital of Rwanda, in a bid to
provide information on the court to Rwandans.
</P>
<P>
Officially launching the center, the United Nations Assistant
Secretary-general and Registrar of the ICTR Agwu Okali said that
trials of the genocide suspects by the ICTR must contribute to the
process of national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
"The launching of this center is an important new dimension in
the relationship between the international tribunal and the people
of Rwanda," he said.
</P>
<P>
In his response, the Prime Minister of Rwanda Bernard Makuza
thanked the ICTR for establishing the center, and said that the
bond of partnership between the ICTR and people of Rwanda has been
reinforced by the move.
</P>
<P>
The center, also named Umusanzu mu Bwiyunge which means a "
Contribution to Reconciliation" in local Kinyarwanda language,
will be the backbone of the tribunal's information program in
Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Based in Arusha, northern Tanzania, the ICTR was created on
November 8, 1994 by resolution 955 of the United Nations Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
The institute has the mandate to try people suspected to be
responsible for genocide and other serious violations of the
international humanitarian law in Rwanda between January 1 and
December 31, 1994.
</P>
<P>
It also has the mandate to try Rwandan citizens responsible for
such violations committed in the territory of neighboring nations
during the 100-day massacre which claimed more than 800,000 lives
of civilians mostly ethnic Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
The ICTR has so far issued 29 indictments against 50
individuals, and a total of 44 indicted individuals are in custody
including several former senior cabinet ministers in the interim
government of Rwanda in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The five detainees who have already been convicted by the Trial
Chambers of the Tribunal are still held in Arusha, pending outcome
of their appeals, but are kept apart from the other detainees to
whom the presumption of innocence applies.
</P>
<P>
Three of the convicts, namely Jean Kambanda, former Prime
Minister of Rwanda, Jean-Paul Akayesu, former Bourgmestre of Taba
and Clement Kayishema, former Prefect of Kibuye, have been
sentenced to life imprisonment.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bush Close in National Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- National polls showed that
U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore and his Republican
rival George W. Bush are close six weeks before the presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
According to three weekend polls published here on Monday,
Republican George W. Bush has erased Democrat Al Gore's lead and
the race is tied once again.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Gore led Texas Governor Bush by 3 percentage
points in a Newsweek survey. Gore had led by 14 points a week ago
in a similar poll conducted by the Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
But a CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll showed that Bush's support rate
stood at 47 percent among likely voters while Gore had 46 percent.
The poll of 693 likely voters was taken September 21-23.
</P>
<P>
The two candidates were also tied according to a poll conducted
by the Fox TV.
</P>
<P>
Gore had moved into the lead in the national polls following
last month's Democratic convention in Los Angeles. Last week, Gore
had led the race in most polls by between 3 and 8 points.
</P>
<P>
Bush has been catching up with his rival in national polls
after he enjoyed successful appearances on TV chat shows and
managed to get his campaign back on message during last week.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: For U.N., Sierra Leone Remains A Test (by Gu Zhenqiu) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a surprise move, India announced last Wednesday its plan to
withdraw its contingent from the 13,000-member U.N. peacekeeping
force in Sierra Leone, dealing another blow to the embattled
mission trying to help restore peace after eight years of civil
war in the former British colony.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan is in contact with several
potential contributors to get more troops to replace Indian
soldiers, and he is expected to make a decision early this week on
who will succeed Indian Major-General Vijay Jetley as the
commander of U.N. soldiers in Sierra Leone, known as the UNAMSIL.
</P>
<P>
The Indian announcement left the 189-member United Nations
scrambling to find replacement for the Indians, whose 3,000-strong
contingent was the second-largest in the mission after Nigeria's.
It also appeared sure to delay even further the plans for beefing
up the force to 20,500 personnel to counter rebel attacks and
exert government authority throughout the war-ravaged nation.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after the U.N. Security Council extended
the U.N. mission in Sierra Leone until December 31 to give the
United Nations, which has been paying much more time to peace and
security in Africa since Annan became head of the world body in
January 1997, more time to round up troops for the planned
increase in the force size.
</P>
<P>
The Indian withdrawal was prompted by the rift between Jetley
and his colleague from Nigeria. The head of the Nigerian army had
called on Jetley to resign after the Indian officer reportedly
accused Nigerian officers of undermining the U.N. mission and
profiting from Sierra Leone's diamond deposits in a memo published
by two newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Even worse, Jordan was reported to be considering pulling out
its soldiers with India after replacements arrived unless troops
from NATO countries joined the U.N. peacekeeping force in Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
As Annan is seeking the replacement of Jetley and his deputies,
diplomats and observers here are thinking of the U.N. role in
peacekeeping operations in the new century.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the UNAMSIL has been plagued with problems since its
inception in October 1999, most seriously the May seizure of 500
peacekeepers by the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF). A
subsequent investigation found that the troops were poorly trained
and equipped and didn't understand their mandate.
</P>
<P>
In the two-week General Assembly general debate, which
concluded last Friday, foreign minister after foreign minister
were touching upon the U.N. peacekeeping force, and almost
everybody shared the view that success can be achieved in U.N.
peacekeeping operations only with clear-cut mandate and sufficient
financial support.
</P>
<P>
The primary focuses of concerns are: an acute shortage of
military advisers with the experience to run complex peacekeeping
missions, and the poor preparation of many troops contributed to
the mission by poor countries.
</P>
<P>
Major Western industrialized countries, who can surely provide
better-trained and better-equipped soldiers, rejected Annan's
request in May to boost the U.N. military presence in Sierra Leone
after the United Nations suffered the disgraceful setback in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Budget cuts, late payments and lack of gratis military
personnel have all contributed to performance that is less than
the professional job the professionals would like to do. The
failure of U.N. peacekeeping operations in Somalia, Rwanda and
Bosnia have fueled the discussion here on the establishment of a
permanent U.N. peacekeeping force. The setback in Sierra Leone has
once again put the topic on the consultation table, even in the 15-
nation Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Permanent posts, of course, cost money, and the largest
contributor and also the largest debtor to the United Nations --
the United States -- has complained about the costs involved in
order to change the agreed payment principles in its interest.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. reluctance to pay the U.N. dues in time, full and
without conditions has plunged the world body into long-time
financial crisis, which has hampered the U.N. capabilities in the
maintenance of peace and security in the world.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the United Nations is composed of member states. It is
member states who can jointly contribute to a stronger
organization, which cannot improve itself alone with the
reluctance of major Western countries to remain as outsiders.
</P>
<P>
Western countries, including the United States, are bragging a
lot about their concerns over the conflicts in Sierra Leone and
other African countries, but African nations and other developing
countries are blaming these rich nations for simply paying lip
service and exercising double standards in funding U.N.
peacekeeping operations.
</P>
<P>
The past experiences vindicate the belief that one more element
should be added to the condition for a successful U.N.
peacekeeping operations: strong political will of member states,
particularly the rich ones.

<HEADLINE> Cubans Holds Huge Demonstration Against U.S. Cuba-Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The protest led by President Fidel Castro took place at the
Jose Marti Anti-Imperialist Plaza directly in front of the U.S.
Interests Section here.
</P>
<P>
The plaza was the scene of almost daily protests during the
international custody battle over the six-year-old Elian Gonzalez,
when it was built for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
Monday's rally condemned U.S. "complicity" in an act of "air
piracy" by Cuban pilot Angel Lenin Iglesias, who departed Cuba
last Tuesday with nine passengers, including his wife and two
children, apparently bound for the United States.
</P>
<P>
The airplane, with 10 people on board, fell to the sea on
Tuesday on the Strait of Florida, resulting in one dead and
several others wounded, one of them seriously, all of them rescued
in the area by a ship and then taken to the U.S. where they were
admitted under the Adjustment Act.
</P>
<P>
The speakers, mainly young students, repudiated the "murderous
law," approved in 1966, which privileges with a right to residence
and work Cuban illegal immigrants arriving into American soil by
any possible means.
</P>
<P>
Cuban authorities consider this law violates the immigration
agreements signed in 1994 and 1995 by Havana and Washington.
</P>
<P>
Those accords in a bid to curb illegal departures from Cuba,
set at a minimum of 20,000 the number of U.S. visas granted to
Cubans each year, and require the United States to repatriate any
illegal emigrants picked up from the waters separating the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
They also repudiated the economic, financial and commercial
blockade the U.S. government has enforced for 40 years against the
island, which by the end of this year, will have suffered severe
losses amounting to 70 billion U.S. dollars, according to official
figures released here.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Party Leaders Invited for Talks in Athens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Announcing this to reporters Monday, Foreign Ministry Spokesman
Panos Beglitis said Papandreou had telephone communications with
most of the Cypriot party leaders, including Democratic Rally
leader Nikos Anastasiades and Democratic Party President and
Speaker of the Cyprus House of Representatives Spyros Kyprianou,
but no specific date of their visits had been set.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-controlled south
and the Turkish Cypriot-dominated north since 1974 when Turkish
troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the eastern
Mediterranean island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union
Athens.
</P>
<P>
As Cyprus' supporter, Greece has firmly backed Nicosia in its
efforts to reunite the island in a federation formula in line with
the U.N. resolutions, but some Cypriot press in recent days
accused Papandreou of being responsible for the present
development in the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
For years, the U.N.-led indirect talks between Cyprus' two
communities have been deadlocked primarily over the refusal of the
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash to meet directly with Cyprus
President Glafcos Clerides or to discuss substantive issues unless
northern Cyprus is recognized.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the fourth round of such talks started in New York,
but President Clerides was annoyed for the statement made by the U.
N. chief Kofi Annan, in which Annan said that the equal status of
the parties must and should be recognized clearly in the
comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Some of the political party leaders in Greece also criticized
Annan's statement and asked the Greek government to coordinate
with Nicosia its policy on the Cyprus problem.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Summit Rules Out Examining Oil Production Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) Monday ruled out taking into
consideration the oil production increase and the high oil prices
during its summit on September 27 and 28 in Caracas.
</P>
<P>
Both issues will be dealt with during the November meeting to
be held in Vienna, said the president of OPEC, Venezuela's
Minister of Energy and Mining Ali Rodriguez, in a statement to the
press Monday.
</P>
<P>
The second summit of OPEC will study the changes which have
taken place in the world since the founding of the organization in
1960 to adapt its performance schemes to the new realities, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will only deal with issues such as the need of
mutual cooperation among its members, intensified oil refining,
and the call to the need of communication between consumers and
producers.
</P>
<P>
They will also talk about issues related with the protection of
the environment, company mergers, the creation of a financial bank,
of an international service firm and a university of OPEC.
</P>
<P>
After many months of intense negotiations and of resisting
constant pressure because of the situation regarding oil prices,
OPEC members will start on September 27 the second summit in its
40-year history, an opportunity to defend its sovereign rights and
to recover its space in the international arena.

Annan had "stressed on many occasions that the political and

Annan "hopes the election result will produce a government with
a clear democratic mandate, with which an open and honest dialogue
is possible," the statement said.

<P>
"This would provide an invaluable opportunity for the country
to come back to the international community and to address all the

<HEADLINE> Panama Considers If to Provide Political Asylum to Montesinos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Panama's government has
decided to consider whether or not to provide political asylum to
the Peruvian presidential advisor, Vladimiro Montesinos, to
prevent a coup d'etat in Peru, said Foreign Minister Jose Miguel
Aleman Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference, Aleman said he received information from
the Peruvian government and other Latin American leaders that "it
was up to Panama to prevent bloodshed among the Peruvian people."
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian official said his Colombian counterpart,
Guillermo Fernandez de Soto, and Secretary of the Organization of
American States (OAS) Cesar Gaviria told him that "there was a
serious risk of a coup d'etat on Monday in Peru."
</P>
<P>
Aleman said that he will meet Monday with Panamanian President
Mireya Moscoso at the Presidential Palace of "Las Garzas" to
consider the formal political asylum application Montesinos
himself has presented before Panamanian authorities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Lima, the Peruvian cabinet formally accepted the
resignation of Montesinos from the post of head of the National
Intelligence Service and thanked him for his "service to the
nation," said a government decree.
</P>
<P>
Montesinos and four other people arrived here early Sunday,
according to Panamanian authorities.
</P>
<P>
Their plane landed in Panama just hours after the Panamanian
cabinet rejected a request for political asylum for Montesinos
submitted by the government of Peru.
</P>
<P>
Montesinos submitted his official request for political asylum
for himself and 11 other people early Monday, according to the
foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
The identities of the people included in the letter remain
unknown.
</P>
<P>
Peru's President Alberto Fujimori has faced criticism since he
was elected to a third term in office in May. Attacks peaked when
a videotape aired showing Montesinos apparently giving a 15,000
dollar bribe to an opposition legislator to cross over to the pro-
Fujimori faction.

<HEADLINE> Romanian PM Says Drought One of Reasons Behind High Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The inflation rate this
year has not followed the government's original estimation of 27
percent, its evolution being influenced by internal as well as
external factors, Romanian Prime Minister Mugur Isarescu told a
news conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
Isarescu explained that the inflation rate would have been
lower by 5 to 6 percent if Romania had not faced its most severe
drought in 50 years. He said this August's inflation rate might
have been only 21 percent instead of the registered 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
The head of the Romanian executive announced that in September
the inflation rate would stand at nearly 2.4 to 2.5 percent, based
on preliminary results obtained in the first 20 days of the month.
The target agreed upon with the International Monetary Fund for
this year is 40 percent, he added.
</P>
<P>
The external factors that influenced the change of the
inflation rate are the depreciation of the euro against the U.S.
dollar and the global price for oil, Isarescu said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister explained that the Romanian state budget
lost as many as 7,000 billion lei (293 million U.S. dollars)
following the calculation of excise on oil products in euros
rather than dollars, starting in the summer of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The amount represents 1 percent of the gross domestic product;
this money might have been used for a lot of many other needs,
Isarescu said.

<HEADLINE> British Finance Minister Targets Cash at Poor Pensioners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRIGHTON, England, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Britain's
Chancellor of the Exchequer (Finance Minister) Gordon Brown
promised Monday to give more money to low- and middle-income
pensioners.
</P>
<P>
The pensioner credit would boost incomes, while the minimum
income guarantee would be raised by 12 pounds (about 18 U.S.
dollars) a week, he told delegates at the ruling Labor's annual
party conference in the southern seaside city of Brighton.
</P>
<P>
But the finance minister rejected calls for an across-the-board
rise for retired people and made no mention of calls for the
restoration of the link with earnings.
</P>
<P>
He also defended the government's approach of giving more money
to the poorest. "If we are to plan for the future, our priority
cannot be that the wealthiest get exactly the same as the neediest,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
"A flat-rate increase will not do enough to help pensioners on
modest incomes and do nothing to diminish growing inequalities but
instead reinforce them," he added.
</P>
<P>
Brown said the details would be in his pre-Budget statement in
November.
</P>
<P>
The new pensioner credit would reward those who had saved, but
also direct cash to those on low and middle incomes, he said.
</P>
<P>
There would be more money for widows and for men and women who
had worked all their lives, he promised.
</P>
<P>
The minimum income guarantee would rise from 78 pounds (113
dollars) to 90 pounds (about 130 dollars) a week, he added.
</P>
<P>
On fuel tax, he said it was right to target tax cuts on the
country's priorities -- but these would not be decided by those
who shouted the loudest and pushed the hardest.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no sudden lurch in tax or spending policy, no
irresponsible pre-election sprees or pay demands that put youth
jobs or any jobs at risk," he said.
</P>
<P>
Brown vaunted the government's economic achievements, such as
lower unemployment and an end to boom-and-bust cycles.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Brown also called on Britain to join in a debate
about the future of public spending, of taxes and pensions.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people, including farmers, protested outside the
Brighton Conference Center Monday against the Labor government's
high fuel tax.

<HEADLINE> British Deputy PM Speaks on Labor's Achievements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRIGHTON, England, September 25 (Xinhua) -- British Deputy
Prime Minister John Prescott said Monday that the Labor Party
members should be proud of the party's achievements since it came
to office in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
Dismissing suggestions that the party was downbeat after a run
of troubles, Prescott insisted the government had "delivered and
delivered and delivered, and is delivering."
</P>
<P>
"We also hear people when they say they want cleaner air, a
better environment," he told delegates of the ruling party's
annual conference in the southern seaside city of Brighton.
</P>
<P>
Prescott cited major initiatives in areas such as regional
representation, the environment, transport, the countryside and
safety at work as examples where the Tories had "failed" but Labor
was delivering.
</P>
<P>
But he refused to bow to demands from protesters for a cut in
fuel tax in response to blockades of oil refineries in the past
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
He said the protesters' demands had been heard by ministers "
loud and clear." But "we also hear people when they say they want
cleaner air, a better environment," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"We hear people say they want money spent on schools and
hospitals -- not to mention farm subsidies and relief for road
haulage," he added.
</P>
<P>
The government would deal with problems through proper
democratic representation in the budget process, he insisted.
</P>
<P>
On transport, Prescott said the Labor government's 10-year plan,
with a total investment of 180 billion pounds (262 billion U.S.
dollars), represents the biggest long-term investment in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Also Monday, hundreds of people, including farmers, protested
outside the Brighton Conference Center against the Labor

<HEADLINE> British Government to Crack Down on N.Irish Paramilitary Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRIGHTON, England, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Northern
Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson said Monday that the Labor
government is to set up a new agency to crack down on organized
crime linked to loyalist and republican paramilitaries in Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
He told delegates of the ruling Labor's annual party conference
in the southern seaside city of Brighton that the agency will have
the powers to seize non-cash assets and prevent the use of land
and property to launder money.
</P>
<P>
Even though the main paramilitary groups are officially on
cease-fire, they are still heavily involved in racketeering,
smuggling across the Irish border and widespread drug dealing.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson also said the police and customs agencies will be in
a concerted drive to cut off the illegal activities at source.
</P>
<P>
He told the conference that police in Britain and the Irish
Republic would be involved in action to "rid Northern Ireland of
this mafia-like virus."

<P>
Organized crime, he said, was feeding egos and financing the
rump of paramilitarism which stood between Northern Ireland and
the decent society the government was striving to create.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson said, "While our focus, rightly, is on defeating
terrorism, we must now reach further and grip the organized crime
it has spawned. That does not belong in a normal, civilized
society. That, too, must come to an end."
</P>
<P>
The Northern Ireland secretary said the government would be
taking new confiscation powers to recover the proceeds of crime.
</P>
<P>
"No longer will the paramilitaries be able to salt away the
profits from their ill-gotten gains. Those days must come to an
end," he pledged.
</P>
<P>
He also warned dissident republicans that they could not bomb
the peace process into submission.
</P>
<P>
He said he would act against loyalists embroiled in a vicious
turf war if he had to.
</P>
<P>
"My message to dissident republicans -- those who think they
can bomb and maim their way to success -- is one that I want to
ring loud and clear at this conference: You will not prevail,"
Mandelson told the conference.
</P>
<P>
"I have already shown that I am prepared to act against those
on the loyalist side who think they can resume their terrorist
activities," Mandelson said. "And, if necessary, I will act again.
"

<HEADLINE> Gore Unveils 74-Page Medicare Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Democratic
presidential candidate Al Gore unveiled a 74-page Medicare plan
Monday to woo senior voters in the country.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Gore, campaigning in Florida to the tune "Bright
Side of the Road," told elderly voters that he would not push
them into the Health Management Organizations (HMOs).
</P>
<P>
In a speech to several hundred seniors and baby boomers, he
said that his Republican rival George W. Bush would force the
elderly into welfare offices to get prescription drugs and would "
violate their sense of dignity."
</P>
<P>
He described Republicans as the natural-born enemies of
Medicare, a health care program serving 39 million elderly and
disabled Americans.
</P>
<P>
"Both Social Security and Medicare in a Gore-Lieberman
administration will be put into an ironclad lockbox," Gore said,
promising to veto any bill that taps into their financing.
</P>
<P>
Gore proposed doubling to two years the minimum requirement for
HMOs contracting with the government to provide health care to the
elderly and disabled in Medicare.
</P>
<P>
Under his plan, penalty for HMOs will be doubled and they will
be barred from rejoining Medicare for two years if they drop
patients.
</P>
<P>
Gore has proposed using 338 billion dollars of the projected 10-
year budget surplus to add a prescription drug benefit to Medicare
that gives free complete coverage to the elderly poor and a
voluntary cost-sharing benefit to others.
</P>
<P>
Gore's Republican rival Bush has proposed spending 158 billion
dollars on Medicare to encourage private-market competition, and
cover the elderly poor's drug costs through state-run programs.
</P>
<P>
Both candidates have vowed to win the 25 electoral votes in
Florida State.

<HEADLINE> Sun Microsystems Invests in Asia-Pacific Technology Innovation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Computer networking
leader Sun Microsystems said Monday that it plans to significantly
increase its investment focus on the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Through its newly-formed Sun Asia Pacific Venture Investment
Program, Sun is targeting 50 million U.S. dollars. In addition,
the company expects the program to provide 250 million dollars in
total investment capital for the region. Sun currently plans to
implement the program through designated local venture capital
partners in each selected country and will focus on early- to mid-
stage Internet start-up companies.
</P>
<P>
"We are seeing entrepreneurial management, engineering talent
and supportive economic infrastructure for high-tech start-ups
emerging across the Asia Pacific region," the company said.
</P>
<P>
Targeted investments will focus on Internet, communications and
e-commerce enabling technologies and products that expand markets
for Sun products and enhance Sun's technology development efforts.
</P>
<P>
Sun will begin discussions with local venture capital groups
immediately in several countries including Japan, South Korea and
Australia. Funding in other countries is expected to follow.
</P>
<P>
Sun said that these investments will be an extension of the 400
million dollars in venture investments primarily in U.S.-based
companies that it had previously announced.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Fall On Persistent Earnings Worries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks fell
Monday as persistent worries about corporate earnings continued
dominating the market.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 39.22 at 10,808.15
points, trimming its gain of 81.85 points last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mostly lower. The technology
heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 62.54 at 3,741.22 and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 9.69 at 1,439.03.
</P>
<P>
The market opened higher with the Dow index rising as much as
50 points in early trading. The Nasdaq composite also gained
nearly 65 points after the market opening.
</P>
<P>
But investors unloaded blue chip stocks and tech shares in late
session in fears of lower corporate earnings in the third quarter.
Stocks have been hit heavily in most of September as a number of
companies warned that their earnings in the third quarter would
not meet expectations because of higher energy costs and lower
product demand in a slowing economy.
</P>
<P>
Late Thursday, last week, Intel warned investors that its third-
quarter sales will fall well short of expectations. The warning
prompted a stock-market sell-off in early trading last Friday but
major indexes recovered much or all of their initial losses by the
close on the strength of old-line companies such as financial
giant J.P. Morgan and drug maker Merck.
</P>
<P>
Some big names dragged the market down Monday. Among them were
Cisco Systems, Microsoft, Intel and Micron Technology.
</P>
<P>
Among the big movers, Ciena rose after the optical network
equipment maker announced a big order from Korea Telecom. Sprint
PCS also rose after Lehman Brothers upgraded its rating of the
mobile phone company.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 0.14 at 659.48. But the American Stock
Exchange index fell 0.93 at 929.01 and the Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies fell 3.44 at 515.38.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-4 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,581 down, 1,282 up and 491
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 977.54 million shares from 1.16 billion
in the previous session.
