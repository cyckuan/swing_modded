She asked the court to direct the federal government and
district magistrate of Rawalpindi to release the detenu, Asif Ali
Zardari.

dismissed her government on Tuesday, of kidnapping Zardari.

She gave a deadline to the government, after which, she
threatened, she would file an criminal case against the president
for the kidnapping.

<HEADLINE> Two Israeli Soldiers Wounded in Lebanese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Two Israeli soldiers were
wounded in attacks by Shiite guerrillas of the Lebanese
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or party of God, in south Lebanon early
today.
</P>
<P>
The attacks took place less than 24 hours after Hezbollah
militants attacked the same Israeli position, destroying an
Israeli Merkava tank, killing one Israeli soldier and wounding
three others, said security sources in the Israeli
self-proclaimed "security zone" in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Guerrillas launched two successive attacks at the Israeli
position of Blat in the buffer zone at 8:40 a.m. (06:40 GMT) and
9:45 a.m. (07:45 GMT), in which they used anti-tank rockets and
machineguns, the security sources said.
</P>
<P>
They added that the Israeli forces at Blat and Hezbollah
guerrillas also exchanged artillery fires, and the guerrillas
fired more than 20 mortar shells at the vicinities of Blat and
Jcbal Al-Basi.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli forces, on the other hand, fired 155mm and 120mm
mortar shells at suspected guerrilla targets on hills and heights
opposite the Israeli-occupied border strip, and some 90 shells
hit the areas in a couple of hours, the sources noted.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Islamic Resistance, the military wing of
Hezbollah, announced that its fighters launched an attack at an
Israeli force near Blat this morning when it was advancing out of
the position by tanks and armored vehicles.
</P>
<P>
A violent clash erupted between the guerrillas and the Israeli
force, which "led to the destruction of two Israeli Merkava
tanks, and the killing and wounding of several Israeli soldiers,"
the statement added. But the security sources could not confirm
the claim.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have shrouded south Lebanon since the Saturday attack
at Blat in which one Israeli soldier was killed, three others
wounded, adding to 24 the Israeli soldiers killed in south
Lebanon since this year.
</P>
<P>
In retaliatory bombardment by Israeli forces at south Lebanese
villages following the attack, at least one civilian was wounded.
</P>
<P>
A militiaman of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army (SLA),
which patrols the 1,100-square-kilometer buffer zone, was also
killed in another attack by Hezbollah guerrillas at the SLA
position of Alman Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Paris-based Orient Radio quoted Israeli security sources
in Jerusalem as saying that the Jewish state has put its troops
in south Lebanon on a high alert.
</P>
<P>
They said that no weeks had passed without a rocket being
launched by Hezbollah guerrillas at Israeli tanks.
</P>
<P>
But the Israeli army was puzzled this time by the destruction
of the Merkava tank Saturday for this kind of tank is equipped
with rocketproof devices, which used to be effective in
protecting the tanks from the guerrillas' anti-tank weapons.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army described the incident as a "dangerous
development," according to the Israeli sources.
</P>
<P>
Hit-and-run attacks by guerrillas and bombardments by Israeli
forces constitute a daily scene on the last battle front of the
Arab-Israeli conflict, where Hezbollah plays a major role in the
guerrilla warfare against the Israeli occupation.

<HEADLINE> Diplomats in Zimbabwe Concerned About Muggings of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Some diplomatic missions in
Zimbabwe have expressed concern over the rising incidences of
mugging of tourists, which lately have become more violent.
</P>
<P>
According to Zimbabwe National News Agency today, the missions
said they had warned potential tourists in their home countries
about the imminent danger of being mugged while visiting
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Tourist muggings could retard growth of the tourism industry
which is rising to be among the country's top foreign currency
earners.
</P>
<P>
Last year over one million tourists arrived in Zimbabwe and
the industry is expected to grow so rapidly that by 1998 it could
earn 400 million U. S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
"In terms of bag snatching, we get about three to four reports
a week, but our concern is that the attacks are becoming more
violent with knives or other weapons sometimes being used," a
spokesman for the Australian High Commission said.
</P>
<P>
He said some of the incidents went unreported as tour groups
sometimes helped the victims make alternative travel
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
"Most of those who come to the embassy would be needing
assistance with air tickets or passports," he said.
</P>
<P>
The British travel and tour agencies had been notified about
the lurking danger of tourists being mugged, said British High
Commissioner Martin Williams.

<HEADLINE> Algeria to Conquer 15 Percent of European Gas Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Algeria opened a second gas
pipeline across the Mediterranean on Saturday, aiming to conquer
15 percent of the gas market in Europe, the Agence France Presse
(AFP) reported.
</P>
<P>
The energy minister of Algeria, Amar Makhloufi Guerraoui,
pushed the button of the Maghreb-Europe Gas Pipeline (GME) at
Hassi R'Mei in the Saharan desert in the presence of his
counterparts from Morocco, Spain, and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
The GME, which cost 2.3 billion U.S. dollars, will supply gas
to Spain and Portugal first, and will be extended to France and
Germany later.
</P>
<P>
AFP quoted Portuguese Minister of Energy Jose Benedos as saying
that GME "is a good example of cooperation between the two sides
of the Mediterranean and of Euro-Mediterranean partnership."
</P>
<P>
The GME, which starts from Hassi R'Mei, the largest gas field
of Algeria, is invested by the Export-Import Bank of the United
States and the European Bank of Investment, and is jointly built
by the U.S. company Bechtel and the Italian company SAIPEM.
</P>
<P>
The present gas producing capacity of GME is about 10 billion
cubic meters, and will be extended by 20 billion cubic meters by
the year 2,000 with the construction of five compression stations.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian national hydrocarbon company, the Sonatrach,
estimates that the GME will double from the year 2,000 its annual
export to 60 billion cubic meters, earning 1 billion dollars a
year.
</P>
<P>
Algeria's first gas pipeline, Transmed, which began to provide
gas to Italy through Tunisia in 1980, has attained a production
capacity of 20 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Algeria, with a hydrocarbon reserve of some 4.2 billion tons
equivalent to petroleum, is providing one quarter of gas
consumption in Southern Europe.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier on Sino-Brazilian Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAO PAULO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said
here today that China and Brazil share identical or similar views
on many international issues and their partnership based on common
goals, equality and mutual benefit will serve the interests of the
people of both countries.
</P>
<P>
Brazil, as the largest developing country in Latin America and
a member of the South American Common Market, could play an
important role in promoting economic and trade cooperation between
China and Latin America, Li said in an interview with four
Brazilian news organizations during his current visit to Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Li said that economic and trade relations between the two
countries have developed remarkedly with bilateral trade volume
nearly hitting 2 billion U.S. dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
He said there exists strong economic complementality between
the two countries and hence great potential for developing their
economic and trade ties.
</P>
<P>
China, standing for trade based on equality and mutual benefit
among all countries in the world, has taken many measures to
attract foreign investments and facilitate the entry of foreign
commodities, said Li, who arrived in Brazil last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Li described his talks with Brazilian President Fernando
Cardoso as fruitful, saying they exchanged views on a broad range
of issues.
</P>
<P>
He said a number of documents of cooperation were signed and
the two nations' entrepreneurs also reached agreement on
strengthening exchanges and cooperation in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
Brazil is the second leg of the Chinese premier's
Latin-American tour which will also take him to Venezuela. He
visited Chile on November 6-7.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier: Socialism Full of Vitality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAO PAULO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- China is conducting steady
political reform while introducing the socialist market economy
with a view to building China into a society with socialist
democracy and legal system that conform to China's conditions, said
Chinese Premier Li Peng here today.
</P>
<P>
Li was speaking in an interview with major Brazilian media
organizations during his official visit to the country.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions on whether China still follows the
socialist road when its economy has opened to the rest of the
world, Li Peng said China has chosen its own way of development in
line with its conditions and the course of history will prove that
China's road of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is
full of vitality.
</P>
<P>
Since China pursued the reform and opening policies 18 years
ago, Li said, its economy has been developing steadily, the
national strength has kept growing and the people's livelihood has
continued to improve. The world people, either those friendly to
China or those with biases toward China, maintain that the trend
of China's economic development is irresistible, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li spoke on how China has combined its communist model with the
market economy, how China has been controlling inflation while
maintaining the economic growth momentum, and on how China has
striven to narrow the gap between the rich and the poor.
</P>
<P>
"Without any doubts, China's long-term objective is to realize
communism, but she is at the present stage building socialism with
Chinese characteristics," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The market economy is something unique to capitalism, he said.
</P>
<P>
While devoting to building the socialist market economy, China
encourages some region or some people to become rich before the
objective of common prosperity is achieved, Li Peng said.
</P>
<P>
Li said the Chinese government has adopted a series of measures
to support the economic development in the underdeveloped regions.
</P>
<P>
One of the measures, he said, is to develop natural resources
and improve transportation and tele-communications conditions in
the regions, in addition to raising the purchasing price of
primary products, mainly agricultural produce, petroleum and coal,
and encouraging foreigners to invest in the regions. Other
measures include the levying of income tax, like that of all other
countries in the world, he added.
</P>
<P>
China is at present tackling the task of correctly handling
relations between reform, development and stability, Li said.
</P>
<P>
"Development is our objective, reform is the driving force of
development, and stability is the prerequisite of reform and
development. And in turn, it is necessary to consolidate social
stability through reform and development," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng stressed that too quick economic growth or too big
reform steps might bring about certain imbalance, thus negatively
affecting social stability. It is necessary to conduct
macro-readjustment to help balance the relations, he said.

<HEADLINE> Clashes Continue in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Clashes between Lebanese
Hezbollah (Party of God) gunmen and Israeli troops continued in
south Lebanon today, when three Israeli soldiers were wounded.
</P>
<P>
According to an Israeli Radio report, the soldiers were
injured in a Hezbollah attack on an Israeli army position in the
western sector of the Israeli self-declared "security zone" in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah fired mortars and missiles at the outpost in
Karkum, in Jabal Balat region, the same position which was under
Hezbollah attack Saturday, when one Israeli soldier was killed,
and three others wounded.
</P>
<P>
During today's incident, all together very similar to
Saturday's clashes, Hezbollah anti-tank missile again directly
struck an Israeli tank at the same Israeli army outpost.
</P>
<P>
All three wounded Israeli soldiers were evacuated to the
Rambam Hospital in Haifa, in north Israel, where doctors said
one of the them was seriously hurt and has been undergoing
operation, while the two others were lightly injured.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile in Lebanon, Beirut Radio also reported exchange of
fire between Hezbollah and Israeli troops in the western sector
of the "security zone."
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a statement issue by Hezbollah as saying
that Hezbollah forces again fire missiles today on the same
Israeli army outpost they attacked Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In response, according to an Israel Television report,
Israeli artillery pounded Hezbollah positions in the region, and
Israeli Air Force jets also participated in the action.
</P>
<P>
The injuries today brought to 88 the number of Israeli
soldiers wounded in south Lebanon since the beginning of this
year, while 24 have been killed, said the report.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, there have been more than 300 attacks
on Israeli army and its surrogate South Lebanon Army (SLA)
targets in the "security zone" and the SLA-controlled Jezzine
enclave north of the zone.
</P>
<P>
Hit-and-run attacks by Hezbollah guerrillas and shellings by
Israeli occupation forces at south Lebanese villages constitute a
daily scene on the last active battlefront of the Arab-Israeli
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the "security zone" in south Lebanon in
1985 as a buffer to shield its northern Jewish settlements from
cross-board guerrilla attacks.

after a two-day visit to Syria.
</P>
<P>
At a joint news conference held by the Irish foreign minister

The Syrian foreign minister praised the stance of the EU in
pushing the peace process forward, describing it as "identical or
very close" to the Arab stance.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring said that the
delegation exchanged views with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
on the present status of the Middle East peace process,
particularly the prospects of the process on the Syrian-Israeli
track.

Spring disclosed that Assad had assured the delegation of
Syria's commitment to the peace process, pointing out that the
Israelis ought to respect the agreements already signed in order
to make progress in the process.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that the Syrian president welcomed an EU role in
the regional peace process as well as the dispatch of a special
EU envoy to the region so that the European role might join hands
with that of the two co-sponsors of the peace process, namely,
the U.S. and Russia.

The three-man troika delegation comprising the representatives
of Ireland, Holland and Italy arrived in Damascus Saturday on an

<HEADLINE> Israel Launches Air Strike at Lebanese Guerrilla </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli forces launched this
afternoon an air raid at Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah (Party of
God) guerrilla bases in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The move was in retaliation for the killing of one Israeli
soldier and the wounding of five others by guerrilla attacks
since Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in south Lebanon reported that Israeli jet
fighters carried out the air raid at the guerrilla bases at 4:50
p.m. (14:50 GMT).
</P>
<P>
They said that one Israeli warplane fired two air-to-surface
missiles at targets on the east side of Ein Buswar village at
Iglim Al-Toffah in the Province of Apple, about 65 kilometers
southeast of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Another Israeli warplane flew over the area in the meantime,
providing a cover for the plane executing the attack, the
security sources said.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah guerrillas fired upward with a SAM-7 surface-to-air
missile and other anti-air weapons without hitting the target.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Army forces around the area also opened fire at the
invaders, the security sources added.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes flew reconnaissance missions since 3:30
p.m. (13:30 GMT) over the area of Nabatiyeh and Iglim Al-Toffah,
a mountain area often used by Moslem guerrillas as a springboard
to attack the Israeli occupation forces in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Today's air raid came when the situation in south Lebanon is
deteriorating following a series of exchanging fires between
Israeli forces and Hezbollah guerrillas since Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in the Israeli self-proclaimed "security
zone" in south Lebanon reported that two Israeli soldiers were
wounded, including one seriously, in attacks by Hezbollah
guerrillas earlier today at the Israeli position of Blat in the
occupied border strip.
</P>
<P>
Guerrillas launched two successive attacks at Blat at 8:40
a.m. (06:40 GMT) and 9:45 a.m. (07:45 GMT), in which they used
anti-tank rockets and machine guns, wounding two Israeli
soldiers, the security sources said.
</P>
<P>
Two militiamen of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army were
also injured in the fightings, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military wing of Hezbollah, has
claimed responsibility for the operations.
</P>
<P>
Following the attack, Israeli artillery shelled suspected
guerrilla targets on the hills and heights opposite the buffer
zone, no casualties were reported by security sources.
</P>
<P>
At least one civilian was wounded when Israeli forces
bombarded south Lebanese villages Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hit-and-run attacks by guerrillas and bombardments by Israeli
forces in south Lebanon constitute a daily scene on the last
battle front of the Arab-Israeli conflict, where Hezbollah plays
a major role in the guerrilla warfare against the Israeli
occupation.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the 1,100-square-kilometer "security zone"
in south Lebanon in 1985 as a buffer to guard against cross-board
guerrilla attacks on its northern Jewish settlements.

<HEADLINE> Conference on Indian Ocean Community Opens in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The International Conference on
Indian Ocean Community opened here today with the participation of
government officials and specialists from 30 Indian Ocean littoral
states and Central Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the conference, Iranian President Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani called on regional countries to join hands
to preserve security and boost cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The president warned that the detrimental and destructive
impacts of disputed regions and centers of danger on the
international security and peace are extensive.
</P>
<P>
Thus, he urged the regional countries to take positive move
to prevent emergence of any crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Ocean region covers 53 coastal nations with
diverse spectrum of culture and a population of 1.5 billion
equivalent to one fourth of the world's total population.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference is seeking to work out ways of
solving regional problems and also assess the present situation
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Countries represented at the conference include Australia,
Indian, Indonesia, Iran, Kenya, Omen, Zimbabwe, Georgia,
Turkmenistan and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati said the Indian Ocean region is suitable for setting up a
regional grouping.
</P>
<P>
He said the Indian Ocean is the world's third largest ocean in
terms of area and one of the richest in terms of minerals.
</P>
<P>
The oil and natural gas reserves of the Indian Ocean region
accounts for 35 percent of the entire oil and gas reserves of the
world, Velayati noted.
</P>
<P>
He said if the oil and natural gas resources of the Caspian
Sea and Central Asian region are taken into account, the
strategical importance of cooperation among the Indian Ocean
littoral states will become clearer.

<HEADLINE> China's Entry Into WTO Benefits World: Li Peng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAO PAULO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said
today that China will continue to strengthen its economic
cooperation and trade with the rest of the world and China's entry
into the World Trade Organization (WTO) will benefit the whole
world.
</P>
<P>
Li, now making an official visit in Brazil, made the remarks in
an interview with major Brazilian media organizations on the
question of China's entry into the WTO and of regional economic
development.
</P>
<P>
China has made great efforts in this regard, Li stated, citing
the huge reduction of tariffs from 35.9 percent to 23 percent as
of last April. The fact is known to the world, Li Peng said.
However, he said, China is still excluded in the organization, and
"this is is not just."
</P>
<P>
The exclusion of China in the WTO will incur losses to China
and will also bring more disadvantages to all the trade partners,
Li said.
</P>
<P>
On regional economic development, Li Peng said the integration
of Latin America has been advancing rapidly and this is the
specific demonstration of Latin America's efforts to maintain
world peace and promote economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"We are not in favor of trade protectionism as the world
development needs increasing exchanges. However, efforts to
establish a common market for common interests are entirely a
different thing," he said.
</P>
<P>
Though China and Brazil are separated afar, they should
strengthen contacts and exchanges and the prospect for their
cooperation and common development is bright, Li Peng noted.

<HEADLINE> Yemeni, Saudi Ministers Discuss Border Disputes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni Deputy Prime
Minister Abdel Karim Al-Aryan and his Saudi Arabian counterpart
Prince Sultan Bin Abdel Aziz today held talks on latest
developments in solving the border disputes between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait News Agency reported from Saudi capital Riyadh that
their talks held there were conducted when the two countries are
making joint efforts to reach a comprehensive and satisfactory
settlement to their border dispute.
</P>
<P>
Al-Aryani, who is also the Yemeni foreign minister, arrived at
Riyadh Saturday and discussed with Saudi Interior Minister Prince
Naif Bin Abdel Aziz on how to end the border dispute.
</P>
<P>
His Saudi tour was the second in 10 days, in an apparent step
to quicken the process of normalization of bilateral relations
through solving the prolonged border disputes.
</P>
<P>
The disputes date back to the 1960s when Britain ended its
domination of the Gulf, leaving ill-defined frontiers separating
the countries.
</P>
<P>
Serious efforts to settle the issue were made by both the
countries in the past two years and progress was attained since
they signed a Memorandum of Understanding in February 1995 aimed
at eradicating tense situation along the border areas and
promoting realization of normal bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Recent months have seen a flurry of exchanges of official
visits and contacts between the two countries, resulting in a
number of agreements on cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Yemeni Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Ahmad Mohammad Al-Kabab was
quoted by KUNA as saying that the exchange of visits was
constructive for the promotion of relations.
</P>
<P>
He said all the meetings and contacts would help facilitate
the work of the joint border committee assigned with the task of
working out details for boundary demarcation according to the Memo.
</P>
<P>
He denied the presence of any disputes obstructing the work
of the committee, which last met in Sanna, Yemen, in August.

<HEADLINE> Humanitarian Groups Ready to Enter Zaire to Rescue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- International humanitarian
groups are ready to enter Zaire to rescue some 1.2 million
refugees faced with death, but they have yet to get the support of
the international community and the green light of the Tutsi
rebels who control the Rwandan-Zairean border.
</P>
<P>
The French humanitarian group Medecins sans Frontiere (MSF)
today became the first to be allowed by the Banyamulenge Tutsi
rebels to enter Zaire from Bukavu, South Kivu, to send two
truck loads of food and medical materials to the refugees, the
Agence France Presse (AFP) quoted MSF officials as saying in
Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, witnesses from the refugees in eastern Zaire said
that it might be already too late for the international community
to intervene as the refugees are dying in thousands of hunger,
thirst, weakness and epidemic diseases such as diarrhoea, cholera
and chronic vomiting.
</P>
<P>
The Tutsi rebels accused the Zairean government forces and Hutu
extremists of holding hundreds of thousands of refugees as
hostages and human shields, while preparing to take back the Kivu
region from the Tutsis, according to AFP reports.
</P>
<P>
AFP quoted the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) as saying in Nairobi that many Hutu refugees who have
returned to Rwanda have wounds from gunshots on their backs.
</P>
<P>
The refugees accused the former Rwandan Hutu Interahawe
militias of shooting at them to stop them from returning to
Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The Interahawe militias, held responsible for the 1994 genocide
against the Tutsis in Rwanda, deliberately unleashed the huge
human exodus of some 1.2 million refugees from refugee camps in
eastern Zaire last month, said the returned refugees.

<HEADLINE> Report Calls for Evacuation of Jews From Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 10 (Xinhua) -- A confidential security
report calls on the Israeli government to pull out the 400 Jewish
settlers from the West Bank city of Hebron, an Israeli Television
report said tonight.
</P>
<P>
The report, called Operation Transfer of the Peace, says that
it is impossible to find a viable solution to Hebron, where about
400 Jews live among some 120,000 Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Reportedly compiled by senior officers of the Israel Defense
Forces (IDF), General Security Service and Police, the report
recommends evacuating the settlers, adding that, otherwise, it
will not be a question of whether, but when, clashes will erupt
between Jews and Palestinians in the city.
</P>
<P>
The report claims that two settler women may try to burn
themselves alive. In addition, it says there is also the
possibility that armed settlers will enter the Palestinian part
of Hebron sparking a major clash.
</P>
<P>
Government sources have denied the report findings. The Prime
Minister's Office today totally rejected any idea of evacuating
Jewish settlement from Hebron, saying that on the contrary, the
government is committed to preserving their wellbeing.
</P>
<P>
President Ezer Weizman today urged the government to carry
out redeployment from Hebron as soon as possible. He also
appealed to Jews, both right and left, not to raise their hands
against each other.
</P>
<P>
Security forces have recently arrested an activist of a Jewish
terrorist organization, and more rightwing extremists are
expected to be held under administrative detention ahead of
Israeli troop withdrawal.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier on Sino-Brazilian Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAO PAULO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng has
said that China and Brazil share identical or similar views on
many international issues and their partnership based on common
goals, equality and mutual benefit will serve the interests of the
people of both countries.
</P>
<P>
Brazil, as the largest developing country in Latin America and
a member of the South American Common Market, could play an
important role in promoting economic and trade cooperation between
China and Latin America, Li said in an interview with four
Brazilian news organizations during his current visit to Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Li said that economic and trade relations between the two
countries have developed remarkedly with the bilateral trade
volume nearly hitting 2 billion U.S. dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
He said there exists strong economic complementality between
the two countries and hence great potential for developing their
economic and trade ties.
</P>
<P>
China, standing for trade based on equality and mutual benefit
among all countries in the world, has taken many measures to
attract foreign investments and facilitate the entry of foreign
commodities, said Li, who arrived in Brazil last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Li described his talks with Brazilian President Fernando
Cardoso as fruitful, saying they exchanged views on a broad range
of issues.
</P>
<P>
He said a number of documents of cooperation were signed and
the two nations' entrepreneurs also reached agreement on
strengthening exchanges and cooperation in the past few days.

<HEADLINE> (Rpt With Correction) Chinese Premier: Socialism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAO PAULO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- China is conducting steady
political reform while introducing the socialist market economy
with a view to building China into a society with socialist
democracy and legal system that conform to China's conditions,
Chinese Premier Li Peng has said.
</P>
<P>
Li was speaking in an interview with major Brazilian media
organizations during his official visit to the country.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions on whether China still follows the
socialist road when its economy has opened to the rest of the
world, Li Peng said China has chosen its own way of development in
line with its conditions and the course of history will prove that
China's road of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is
full of vitality.
</P>
<P>
Since China pursued the reform and opening policies 18 years
ago, Li said, its economy has been developing steadily, the
national strength has kept growing and the people's livelihood has
continued to improve. The world people, either those friendly to
China or those with biases toward China, maintain that the trend
of China's economic development is irresistible, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li spoke on how China has combined its communist model with the
market economy, how China has been controlling inflation while
maintaining the economic growth momentum, and on how China has
striven to narrow the gap between the rich and the poor.
</P>
<P>
"Without any doubts, China's long-term objective is to realize
communism, but she is at the present stage building socialism with
Chinese characteristics," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The market economy is something unique to capitalism, he said.
</P>
<P>
While devoting to building the socialist market economy, China
encourages some region or some people to become rich before the
objective of common prosperity is achieved, Li Peng said.
</P>
<P>
Li said the Chinese government has adopted a series of measures
to support the economic development in the underdeveloped regions.
</P>
<P>
One of the measures, he said, is to develop natural resources
and improve transportation and tele-communications conditions in
the regions, in addition to raising the purchasing price of
primary products, mainly agricultural produce, petroleum and coal,
and encouraging foreigners to invest in the regions. Other
measures include the levying of income tax, like that of all other
countries in the world, he added.
</P>
<P>
China is at present tackling the task of correctly handling
relations between reform, development and stability, Li said.
</P>
<P>
"Development is our objective, reform is the driving force of
development, and stability is the prerequisite of reform and
development. And in turn, it is necessary to consolidate social
stability through reform and development," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng stressed that too quick economic growth or too big
reform steps might bring about certain imbalance, thus negatively
affecting social stability. It is necessary to conduct
macro-readjustment to help balance the relations, he said.

the huge reduction of tariffs from 35.9 percent to 23 percent as
of last April. The fact is known to the world, Li Peng said.
However, he said, China is still excluded in the organization, and
"this is is not just."
</P>
<P>
The exclusion of China in the WTO will incur losses to China
and will also bring more disadvantages to all the trade partners,
Li said.
</P>
<P>
On regional economic development, Li Peng said the integration
of Latin America has been advancing rapidly and this is the
specific demonstration of Latin America's efforts to maintain
world peace and promote economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"We are not in favor of trade protectionism as the world
development needs increasing exchanges. However, efforts to
establish a common market for common interests are entirely a
different thing," he said.
</P>
<P>
Though China and Brazil are separated afar, they should
strengthen contacts and exchanges and the prospect for their
cooperation and common development is bright, Li Peng noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
SAO PAULO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng has
stressed that a world dominated by only one country would be
harmful to all developing countries and to other countries as
well.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with four Brazilian news organizations during
his current visit to Brazil, Li Peng said that during his talks
with Brazilian President Fernando Cardoso in Brasilia Friday, he
and Cardoso shared the view that the world now is developing in
the direction of multipolarization.
</P>
<P>
The accelerated development of the world toward
multipolarization benefits world peace, security and stability,
said the Chinese premier.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier, who is now in Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest
city, to continue his visit to Brazil, arrived in the country on
November 7. Brazil is the second leg of his Latin America tour
which will also take him to Venezuela. He has already visited
Chile.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Calls on EU To Honor Commitments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has expressed its
displeasure with the European Union (EU) for its failure to honor
its commitments towards Ankara made in a bilateral customs union
accord which came into force at the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller lodged
the complaint to Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring, whose country
holds the EU's rotating term presidency, at a meeting in Istanbul
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement after her two-and-a-half hour meeting,
Ciller said that the EU is not honoring its commitments towards
Turkey despite the conclusion of the custom union.
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament recently voted to halt transition of
credits earmarked for Ankara under the custom union accord citing
human rights conditions in Turkey and alleged aggression by
Turkey in Cyprus, the Aegean and northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
These credits had already been blocked due to a Greek veto. So
the European Parliament's decision to drop the credits only served
to sharpen the Turkish-EU relations.
</P>
<P>
Anatolia News Agency quoted Ciller as describing the blocking
of these credits to Turkey as a "great injustice."
</P>
<P>
Ciller's meeting with Spring was designed to prepare the
groundwork for the upcoming meeting of the Turkish-EU Association
Council which is due to be held in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Displaying Turkey's eagerness to join the EU to Spring, Ciller
also said that Turkey's bid for EU membership should not be pushed
behind those of central and eastern European countries in view of
the Ankara's traditional links with the union.

<HEADLINE> Athens Stock Exchange to Resume Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Greek National Economy Ministry
Secretary General Apostolos Fotiadis announced today that the
Athens Stock Exchange (ASE), which suspended trading Friday, would
be open for business as usual Monday.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after a clean-up operation was decided by
the government at the ASE following a series of meetings between
the Union of Stock Exchange Members and the National Economy
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The ASE suspended trading Friday for the first time in its
120-year-old history following the inability of the Delta S.A.
Brokerage firm to cover cash obligations to the depository of 2.6
billion drachmas (about 11.3 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to reports today, the titles depository has agreed to
guarantee transactions and will cover Delta's debt. Meanwhile, it
was also reported that the brokers have no objection to having
part of the debt covered by the Joint-Surety Fund on the condition
that transactions be covered by a legislative amendment
prohibiting cash being transferred to brokerage firms owing
titles.
</P>
<P>
Fotiadis stressed that in the future, any company that broke
the rules would be forced to discontinue transactions and would be
fined 50 million drachmas (about 210,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Athens' public prosecutor George Koliokostas filed charges of
criminal fraud against Delta's chairman, vice-president and a
board member Friday and prohibited them from leaving the country.

<HEADLINE> France Accuses British Shop of Cheating Customers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The French government today
accused the British shop, Crazy George's, of cheating customers
with posters giving deceptive prices and treatments.
</P>
<P>
French Minister of Economy and Finances Jean Arthuis today
ordered Crazy George's, which opened Saturday a shop in Bovigny,
northeast of Paris, "to wait a couple of days before receiving new
customers."
</P>
<P>
Crazy George's, which caters for customers of low incomes,
invites people to buy its furniture, electric appliances and
Hi-Fi's with treatment of paying the products in several years.
</P>
<P>
The posters put out by the shop have the price to be paid on a
weekly basis written in big characters, but hide the fact that the
price for commodities sold this way can double in a three-year
period.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France Presse (AFP) quoted good sources as saying
that the heads of Crazy George's have decided to close their shop
for one week.
</P>
<P>
"Crazy George's cannot resume its business as long as it does
not respect the law," said Arthuis, while denying that the
government had resorted to administrative measures to close the
shop.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the shop pulled down all the posters it had put
out tonight, it could open Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
"To certain degrees, the shop has jumped over the yellow line.
I urge all its leaflets to conform with the law," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) member states have rejected Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu's suggestion on the establishment of a
Palestinian self-rule entity in association with Israel,
according to reports reaching here today from Doha, Qatar.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hamad Bin Jaber al Thani, Qatari Minister of Foreign
Affairs, made the remarks today at a news conference held in Doha
upon the conclusion of the 61st session of the GCC foreign
ministers in preparation of the 17th GCC summit due to take place
in Doha in December.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari minister pointed out the necessity of Israel's
adherence to the agreements signed with the Palestinian side,
underlining the importance of resuming negotiations on the Syrian
and Lebanese tracks.
</P>
<P>
He underscored that the GCC will closely follow the situation,
and will take necessary measures in response to any attempt of
Israel to disavow its previous pledges, hoping that the Israeli
government will reconsider its stances toward the peace process
and adhere to the accords that have already been signed.
</P>
<P>
He added that during the third sitting of the GCC foreign
ministers in Doha today, within the context of the GCC
ministerial conference, discussions covered ways and means of
strengthening joint cooperation among GCC member states in the
political, economic, military, security and information fields.
</P>
<P>
The GCC ministers also discussed Arab and international issues
of common interest, as well as the works of the two previous
closed sittings which were held Saturday to draft an agenda for
the upcoming GCC summit, said the Qatari foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
The 61st session of the GCC foreign ministers began in Doha
Saturday.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- France today asked the United
States to assume the command of a multinational force likely to be
deployed in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette said on Radio France
Internationale that the participation of the United States was
indispensable because it would make the operation a purely
humanitarian one without any suspected national interests involved.
</P>
<P>
France has been accused by Rwanda of having its own interests by
calling for the deployment of an international force in eastern
Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"It is so true that we have said from the beginning of the game
that we don't want the command of this operation. We don't want that
it (the command) would be French. We proposed that it should be
American," said de Charette.
</P>
<P>
The United States is highly reserved over a French proposal to
have a 5,000-man multinational force deployed in eastern Zaire to
rescue more than 1 million refugees faced with death.

ATHENS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Athens Stock Exchange (ASE)
remained shut for the second day despite an earlier announcement
by the government that it would resume trading today.
</P>
<P>
The members of the Union of Stock Exchange Members (SMEXA) are
continuing their marathon meeting on whether to abstain from
trading.
</P>
<P>
Brokerage firms stopped all trade on the ASE last Friday for
the first time in its 120-year-old history to protest at its
clearing house's failure to settle transactions with some of them
after the Delta Brokerage S.A., a member firm, tried to pay with
bad checks, the amount of which is estimated at 2.6 billion
drachmas (11.3 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The brokers had called on the country's National Economy
Ministry to ensure the correct operation of the system of
clearance of transactions, claiming that the titles depository
owed brokerage firms money.
</P>
<P>
National Economy Ministry Secretary General Apostolos Fotiadis
said that the government's main concern is the resumption of
trading on the ASE with the full clearance of transactions.
</P>
<P>
Fotiadis added that all investors hit by Delta's inability to
meet its obligations would be reimbursed by the brokerage firms'
joint-surety fund.

PARIS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The beginning of the 78th

Chirac placed a bunch of cornflowers before the Tomb of Unknown
Soldiers under the Triumphal Arch, while church bells rang in

<P>
TEHRAN, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Commerce Minister
Yahya al-Oshaq today denied any trade between his country and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, the minister said "We
have no trade with the United States. There is absolutely no
trade with Americans either in terms of exports or imports."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian minister added that Germany will be Iran's largest
trade partner, with the trade volume between Iran and Germany
estimated at 4 billion U.S. dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
Some diplomats here had alleged that Iran was doing trade with
some U.S. companies in third countries such as Britain and Spain.
</P>
<P>
They noted that Iranians rely on U.S. products for the
maintenance of Boeing passenger airliners, oil drilling
facilities, computers and U.S. weapons.
</P>
<P>
The annual direct or indirect trade volume between Iran and
the United States used to standing at 3 or 4 billion dollars in
the past few years.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. companies stopped direct trade with Iran after
Washington enforced tough sanctions upon Iran in June 1995 for
its alleged support for terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian commerce minister said "the United States has
undertaken whatever possible hostile measures it could against
us, restrict us, sanction us and even use the domestic law to
punish foreign firms doing business with us."
</P>
<P>
"However, none of the U.S. measures against Iran has had the
smallest impact on the country, " the minister said.

BEIJING, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan's Advantech Company, a
world-renowned manufacturer of personal computer-based industrial
automation systems, is to increase its investment in interior
areas of China.
</P>
<P>
Though applications of PCs are not as widely used in industrial
fields as in commercial fields, there is a growing trend of
resorting to PCs to improve industrial automation, according to an
official at the company.
</P>
<P>
Advantech aims to help the interior areas promote the use of
PCs in industrial automation. It is expected to win more than 200
million yuan in yearly sales in interior areas by the turn of the
century.
</P>
<P>
It has invested more than 100 million yuan on a new building in
Beijing, which is expected to be completed in the early 1997.
</P>
<P>
Advantech plans to move its research center from the US to
Beijing, and introduce PC-based industrial system production lines
in the new building, to turn it into a major international base
for Advantech.
</P>
<P>
Set up in 1983, Advantech opened its first branch in interior
areas of the country in 1991 in Shenzhen. It plans to hold a
global sale conference in Beijing next May.

<HEADLINE> China's Current Interest Rate Level Appropriate: spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 11 (Xinhua) -- China's bank interest rate -
cut twice this year - is expected to stay unchanged for the rest
of this year.
</P>
<P>
A central bank spokesman has said that the current interest
rate level is appropriate, indicating that there would not be a
further cut in the remaining days of this year, according to the
China Securities News.
</P>
<P>
"Judging from the present economic and financial situation, we
can say that the two rate cuts this year have produced the desired
results, and the present interest rate level is appropriate," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the leverage of interest rates can only be
wielded with full consideration of the overall performance of the
national economy, the structure of the present financial market,
and the interests of bank depositors.
</P>
<P>
China lowered its interest rates on May 1 this year by an
average of 0.75 percentage points on bank lendings, and 0.98
percentage points on savings. The second cut, starting from August
23, brought the interest rate level down by an average of 1.2
percentage points on loans and 1.5 percentage points on deposits.
</P>
<P>
"The two rate cuts were based on declining inflation, and they
have eased the debt burden of Chinese enterprises, large and
medium-sized state-owned ones in particular," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"The money liquidity was also improved greatly due to the two
rate cuts," the central bank spokesman said, adding that improved
efficiency of its assets management was also a blessing to China's
commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman stressed that in spite of the optimistic
situation of its inflation and the national economy, China
considers its present interest rate level "appropriate", which was
taken by economic analysts as a central bank signal of no further
rate cut in the near future.
</P>
<P>
China's retail price index rose an average of 6.6 percent
during the past nine months this year, the lowest in four years.

<P>
SAO PAULO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Li
Peng has called for closer economic cooperation between Sao Paulo
and China's largest industrial city of Shanghai to help promote
the Sino-Brazilian all-round cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks at a banquet given in his honor by Mario
Covas, premier of the Sao Paulo State.
</P>
<P>
Sao Paulo, as the economic, trade and financial center of
Brazil, is capable of further expanding cooperation with its
sister city of Shanghai in various fields, said the Chinese
premier.
</P>
<P>
The signing of document on high-tech cooperation in aerospace
between Sao Paulo, the important base of Sino-Brazilian joint
satellite research center, and relevant Chinese institutions, has
provided a new opportunity for deepening aerospace research and
development in the two countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
China and Brazil are in different hemispheres, but their
economies strongly supplement each other and they can play a
greater role in maintaining world peace and in promoting global
economic development, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Covas said he was happy to host the premier of China, a great
country with long-standing civilization and splendid future.
</P>
<P>
China's enormous economic achievements over the past years had
won his admiration, he said.
</P>
<P>
Covas said that Brazil and China have many in common and share
common objectives, and as big countries, they are playing
important roles in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
He believed that Li's visit to his country would accelerate
bilateral political, economic and trade relations.

China's democratic revolution, has been hailed in an editorial to

<P>
BEIJING, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Baogang Education Fund, the
first to be sponsored by a state-owned enterprise in China, today
rewarded 911 outstanding college students and teachers.

<P>
In a ceremony at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, each
of the 693 students won a scholarship of 2,000 yuan, ten teachers
each received 10,000 yuan for winning special awards for
teachers and the rest of the teachers won 5,000 yuan per person.
</P>
<P>
Baogang Education Fund was set up by the Shanghai Baoshan Steel
Company (known as Baogang in Chinese) in 1990 with an initial fund
of two million yuan (over 240,000 U.S. dollars), to support
China's higher education, and encourage a combination of
laboratory research with practice in factories.
</P>
<P>
With the the belief that Baogang belongs to people of the
country, Baogang increased the Fund to 35 million yuan (about 4.2
million U.S. dollars), and began to give awards to excellent
teachers in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Kaixuan, minister in charge of the State Education
Commission (SEC), said at today's award ceremony that as a
first-class enterprise in China, Baogang has made
significant contributions, not only to the country's economic
construction, but also to the country's educational development.
</P>
<P>
Zhu urged all society to care and support China's education
course following the example of Baogang.
</P>
<P>
Dain Zhu Ngang Bum, who became a professor at the age of 37, is
the youngest professor of the ethnic group of Tibet. He was one of
the teachers who won the special award for teachers.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of teachers with ethnic minority backgrounds, Dain
Zhu Ngang Bum expressed thanks to Baogang and to society for
caring and supporting the education of ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
Baogang has decided to increase the fund again next year, and
reward even more students and teachers from across the country.
</P>
<P>
Over 3,000 students and 614 teachers from 105 colleges,
universities and research academies have won awards provided by
Baoshan Education Fund since it was founded.
</P>
<P>
Baogang, established in 1978 with a total investment of three
million yuan, now yields 8.51 million tons of steel annually. It

taxes last year.

<HEADLINE> Two Wounded in Serb-Muslim Clash Over Returning Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Muslims and Serbs
exchanged fires on Monday morning in a row over Muslim refugees
trying to return home in Koraj in the Serb-controlled area,
wounding a Dutch United Nations police monitor and a Serb, the
U.N. international police said.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred when 500 Muslims displaced in Celic in
northeastern Bosnia were crossing the Inter-Entity Boundary Line
(IEBL), an administrative border between Serb-held territory and
that of Muslims and Croats drawn by the Dayton peace accord, a
U.N. spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"We had a police monitor wounded in the town of Koraj this
morning after shooting broke out," Alexander Ivanko, spokesman for
the U.N. International Police Task Force (IPTF), said.
</P>
<P>
He added NATO-led peace troops and U.N. monitors had been sent
to restore order near the Zone of Separation between the Serb
republic and the Muslim-Croat federation.
</P>
<P>
The zone, more than 1,000 kilometers long and four kilometers
wide covering territories of both entities, has been a place for
on-and-off conflicts between Muslims and Serbs.
</P>
<P>
Ivanko said some Muslims had applied to return home on the Serb
side of the IEBL and their applications were under review,
indicating their movement on Monday was "premature."
</P>
<P>
Muslim refugees want to reclaim their houses and villages,
while Serbs try by all means to prevent it which they fear will
threaten the "territorial integrity" of the Serb republic.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Mozambican Police Shaken Up by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The worsening crime in the
southern African nation Mozambique has led to a major shakeup in
the police force, with Interior Minister Manuel Hose Antonio and
his deputy Edmundo Carlos Albert dismissed recently from their
posts.
</P>
<P>
Almerrinho Marque Manhenje, minister of presidential affrairs
in charge of security, has been appointed the new interior
minister, which indicates the determination of the government to
crack down on the crime under the direct guidance of presidency.
</P>
<P>
Crime has gone rampant in Mozambique since last November. A
total of 21,900 criminal cases had been filed across the country
by early November this year, a sharp rise of 10.78 percent over
the previous year's 19,800 cases. In worst cases, 20 people
were killed in the capital city of Maputo in the third quarter
of this year.
</P>
<P>
Despite the trend to stability and development since 1992,
when the country stepped out of years of civil war, unemployment
has remained a headache for the fledgeling government of national
unity. The problem is coupled with the hard settlement of 1.7
million displaced people.
</P>
<P>
Abreast with unemployment is poverty in contributing to the
worsening security situation in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
With a meagre per capita income of 90 U.S. Dollars, the
country of 17 million population, which is listed as the poorest
of the world, has to grapple with a heavy external debt of 5.5
billion Dollars.
</P>
<P>
A result is that about 92,000 residents of 13 major cities
across the country are living on a monthly subsidy of three
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
While crime on rise in company with all the social and
economic problems, 30 percent of the police officers have proved
unqualified for the job, the local media quoted a study by a
group of Spanish experts as saying recently.
</P>
<P>
Those police officers, either uneducated or poorly trained,
are subject to corruption campaigns waged by crime rings,
according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
Donar countries, who agreed to provide 33 million Dollars for
the training of 9,000 Mozambican police in July this year, are
actually holding back the fund in fear of the money fallen into
the hands of crime cyndicates, the reports say.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican police have to make do with their extremely
inadequate equipment. Only five police vehicles are seen on
patrol mission in Maputo, the city of two million people. It is
not unusual that the police cannot but see criminals get away
with it because of the inadequacy of the necessary equipment.
</P>
<P>
In response of the increasing appeal for order and security,
the government is intensifying efforts to put down the crime,
while considering the proposal of restoring death penalty,
which was abolished in the late 1980s.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 11 (Xinhua) -- China's market prices
maintained stable in October, according to a news release jointly
issued today by the State Planning Commission and the State
Statistical Bureau.
</P>
<P>
In October, China's general level of retail sales prices rose
4.7 percent over the same period of last year, but decreased 0.3
percent against September.
</P>
<P>
The commission and the bureau have urged various localities to
continue to tighten the control of prices, and carry out the
annual check of market prices to ensure a good environment for the
adjustment of economic structures, and improve the efficiency of
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
They have also asked various areas to carry out policies on
state-purchased grain to protect the interests of farmers, and
provide winter vegetable supplies to urban citizens in time, to
help keep stability in vegetable prices in towns and cities.

<HEADLINE> Cairo Conference to Show Regional Potentials: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal
al-Ganzouri has said the economic conference on the Middle East and
North Africa (MENA III), due to open here tomorrow, will show the
potentialities in the region to the whole world.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Good Morning Egypt TV program today,
Ganzouri expressed belief that the conference will afford a good
opportunity for urging industrialized countries to cooperate with
the states in the region.
</P>
<P>
MENA III will also be an occasion for countries in the region
to prove to industrialized states that they are capable with their
potentials, to embark upon joint industrial, tourist and
agricultural ventures, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri also said that the developed world will reconsider
their attitude to cooperation with countries of the area
especially after knowing better about their potentialities of
huge market, natural resources and trained manpower.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the whole region boasts huge market of 800 million
consumers, including 250 million in the Arab countries, an equal
number in North Africa and another 300 million in the Republics of
the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).
</P>
<P>
Asked about the Israeli representation at the Cairo conference,
Ganzouri said Israel was invited just like all the other countries
and would get an equal treatment as well.
</P>
<P>
He also dismissed the Israeli claim that it is the focal point
of regional cooperation, saying no other country would buy it.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody can say that when it is crystal clear what the
available potentialities are in the whole area and the
capabilities of every country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt welcomes all participating countries to the conference
without differentiation and with the same warmth, he added.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Joins in Renovation Work on Yongdinghe River (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
and other top leaders today joined a 1,000 strong team of
volunteers in a clean-up drive along a Beijing river.
</P>
<P>
From all walks of life, the volunteer corps headed to the
Fengtai District of Beijing to dredge and renovate a stretch of
the Yongdinghe River.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed that it is an important duty of the
Party and government to strengthen water conservancy work. He
urged Party committees and governments at various levels to list
water conservancy construction as a major task on their agendas.
</P>
<P>
He said that water conservancy is a great undertaking,
benefiting future generations. Everyone in society should do their
bit, and show concern for the cause.
</P>
<P>
At 3:30 this afternoon, Party and State leaders Jiang Zemin, Li
Ruihuan, Zhu Rongji, and Hu Jintao, together with other officials,
arrived at the water conservancy construction site on the
Yongdinghe River. They first heard reports from acting Beijing
mayor Jia Qinglin about the project.
</P>
<P>
According to the mayor, the 680-km-long river runs through
Beijing for a length of 170 kilometers, and has always been the
main water course threatening the safety of the capital.
</P>
<P>
In 1985, the water conservancy project on Yongdinghe River was
listed as one of the country's four major flood control
programs.

<HEADLINE> China's Real Estate Market to Recover Soon, Scholar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 11 (Xinhua) -- China's leading real estate
expert, Professor Lin Zengjie, has predicted that the country's
real estate market is expected to recover in the near future from
a lingering three-year lull.
</P>
<P>
The scholar, who is teaching at Chinese People's University
Land Management Department, and is an executive director of the
China Land Society, made the prediction in an exclusive interview
with Xinhua at his home in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
In the interview, the expert noted that real estate sector is a
leading industry for any country, and it always develops along
with the growth of the national economy as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The real estate sector in China is set to revive again as
another round of investment craze is approaching in the country,
the professor said.
</P>
<P>
China's real estate industry, after remaining sluggish for the
last three years, is gradually becoming ripe, while the legal
system and laws governing the industry have also been more refined
than before, he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed, there will not be a repeat of a real
estate craze, like the one in 1992, since local real estate
investors have become mature, more reasonable and cautious.
</P>
<P>
The recent interest-readjustment by the central bank has had
two-sided effects on the real estate market, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, the interest-cuts help turn more private
savings into spendings, which is good for boosting the market,
while a large-scale underground banking market may appear due to
the current shortage of funds, which would hamper the development
of the market, according to the scholar.
</P>
<P>
The high cost of purchasing land, and high charges by local
administrative departments have been the main factors leading to
the current high prices of houses, which the majority of local
consumers are unable to afford, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
He praised the recent decree by the State Planning Commission
demanding that local governments lower the administrative charges
levied on infrastructural facilities, such as telecommunications,
road and water and power supplies.
</P>
<P>
The order will contribute to possible cuts in outlay by
individual house-purchasers, if local administrative bodies reduce
the fees substantially, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mortgage loans are a common method adopted internationally to
encourage the sale of residential properties, but in China the
time has not come for large-scale distribution of such loans, due
to the high interest rates of mortgage loans and lack of policies
and supporting funds from the government, according to Lin.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official Calls for Joint Efforts to Solve Transitional Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Macao has so far witnessed a smooth transition with good
cooperation between China and Portugal," he said. "Problems like
the localization of law, civil servants and the use of the Chinese
as an official language, the treasury reserves, economic revival
and social security should be solved by joint efforts from all
sides of the society."
</P>
<P>
The director stressed that to tackle problems of the
transitional period, compatriots in Macao should be united under
the banner of patriotism so that joint efforts could be made to
handle any possible problems.
</P>
<P>
"In handling problems of the transitional period, we should
follow the principle of 'seeking major common ground while
reserving minor differences,'" Wang said. "The major common ground
 is that the policy of 'one country, two systems' will be
implemented. Meanwhile the minor differences can be solved through
 discussions and consultations."
</P>
<P>
In addition, the director called on people of all walks of
life in Macao to participate in the transitional affairs so that a
 social stability and economic prosperity could be realized.
</P>
<P>
"We should maintain social stability and economic prosperity in
 Macao," he said, "so that all preparatory work will be done for
the creation of a special administrative region in the future."

<HEADLINE> China's Visa Services in HK on Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The visa services in Hong
Kong offered by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) have
 promoted investment and business from overseas and scientific,
technological and cultural exchanges between China and other
countries, a Chinese official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Dai Changshi, director of the MFA's Visa Office in Hong Kong,
said the number of visas and travel documents issued by his office
 each year has increased from tens of thousands in the earlier
years to hundreds of thousands today.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony marking the 15th anniversary of the
establishment of the Visa Office in Hong Kong, Dai said that over
the past 15 years, the office has issued millions of visas and
travel documents and established extensive links and contacts with
 the relevant departments of the Hong Kong government and foreign
consular missions in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Visa Office started to accept and process visa applications
 on November 26, 1981, and the first applicant was a Chinese
American who urgently needed to travel to the mainland to see his
seriously ill mother. It took him only one and half hours to get
his visa.
</P>
<P>
Dai said that before the Visa Office was established in Hong
Kong, it was simply impossible for an applicant to get a mainland
visa in Hong Kong at such a short notice.
</P>
<P>
The scope of its services has now been extended to include the
issue of visas to foreigners, issue and replacement of Chinese
passports, issue of the Travel Permit of the People's Republic of
China and the Taiwan Resident Mainland Travel Permit and
submission of visa applications for all mainland exported labor to
 Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Dai said that on July 1, 1997, the Visa Office will be
integrated into a future MFA office in Hong Kong and its consular
affair-related services and operations will expand on the existing
 basis.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, the office will continue to play its role in
safeguarding state sovereignty and national interests, promoting
exchanges and cooperation between the HKSAR and the rest of China
and other countries and ensuring Hong Kong's long-term prosperity
and sustained economic growth.

<P>
After hearing the report, the president and other leaders
started their voluntary work, earthing up embankments with spades.
</P>
<P>
When the voluntary labor was over, the president told reporters
that most parts of the country have been hit by floods or droughts
this year. The soldiers of the PLA and local people, under the
leadership of local Party committees and governments, have won
victories in fighting against floods and droughts, and succeeded
in reducing disaster losses to the minimum.
</P>
<P>
The president said that large groups of water conservancy
projects built since the founding of New China in 1949 have played
a major role in flood control and drought relief, which have
ensured bumper harvests in various disaster years, and safeguarded
social stability and the smooth progress of the country's reform
and opening-up drive.
</P>
<P>
He said that the country's victories gained in fighting
against floods and droughts fully displayed the superiority of the
socialist system, adding that water conservancy is the lifeline of
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has always paid high attention to water
conservancy construction, Jiang said. He called on various
localities to make constant efforts and work out well-conceived
plans to develop water-control projects.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Preparations are in full
swing for the establishment of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR), Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan said here today.
</P>
<P>
At a reception to mark the 15th anniversary of the

</P>
<P>
He said that after its resumption of the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong, the Chinese government will firmly
implement the policy of "one country, two systems" and earnestly
fulfill its commitments under the Sino-British Joint Declaration
on the Question of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law will be put into effect so that Hong Kong will
enjoy "a high degree of autonomy" and will be administered by the
Hong Kong people, he said.
</P>
<P>
He reassured that the way of life in Hong Kong will remain as
it is and the laws previously in force in Hong Kong will remain

He noted that the economic interests of other countries in
Hong Kong will be protected.
</P>
<P>
He said that in accordance with the Basic Law, the Chinese

<HEADLINE> HK New Airport Budget Reduced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government
announced today that the budget for the Airport Core Program (ACP)
 has been reduced by 1,805 million HK dollars (231.41 million
U.S. dollars) principally as a result of significant savings on
three of the seven government core projects.
</P>
<P>
A New Airport official was quoted as saying the government had
achieved considerable savings from the Lantau Link, Route 3 and
the West Kowloon Reclamation projects.
</P>
<P>
He said that as a result of these savings, the overall cost
estimate for the 10 projects in the ACP had been reduced from
158,169 million HK dollars (20,278 million U.S. dollars) to
156,364 million HK dollars (20,047 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
This is the second time that the ACP budget has been
reduced. In January 1994 the ACP budget was cut from 163,730
million HK dollars (20,991 million U.S. dollars) to 158,169
million HK dollars mainly because of savings arising from
government contracts being awarded below the original estimates.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's New Airport at Chek Lap Kok is scheduled for
completion in mid-1998.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Compromise of Peace and Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 11 (Xinhua) -- When peace hopes dimmed,
business enthusiasm are nevertheless running high on the eve of
the third Middle East and North Africa (MENA) economic
conference, whose success is far more likely than not if the
gauge is multinational money.
</P>
<P>
MENA III, which is the successor to the 1994 Casablanca
Conference and the 1995 Amman Conference, is intended to be "a
conference for business," said a coordinator at the conference.
</P>
<P>
That much is clear from the theme of the conference "building
for the future and creating an investor-friendly environment."
</P>
<P>
It seems that, the business community has set its mind on
prying open the giant market of an estimated 200 million
consumers from the Atlantic to the Gulf, that to date has not
been utilized to capacity.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the smell of confrontation instead of
cooperation still lingers.
</P>
<P>
Five Arab states have decided to boycott the conference due to
the Israeli intransigence on replacing the internationally
accepted formula of land-for-peace with peace-for-peace since the
rightwing Likud party took power in June.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a number of reluctant participants said they are
coming here only in deference to Egypt and not to serve Israeli
interests.
</P>
<P>
Some Israeli businessmen and several cabinet ministers also
responded by staying away from the conference.
</P>
<P>
Politics aside, Arabs or Israelis alike are strategically
interested to see the influx of foreign investment in the region,
which has suffered four decades of bloodshed and conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The enthusiasm has been reflected in the vast scale of
representation and the variety of ambitious regional projects
presented to the Cairo Conference.
</P>
<P>
The 100-strong Israeli delegation complete with five cabinet
ministers is to propose 100-plus projects.
</P>
<P>
Tel Aviv allegedly intends to enlarge its trophy at MENA III,
a direct spin-off of the 1991 Madrid peace conference. Since then
Israel's GDP has jumped 42 percent to 85 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the cornerstone of the Mideast peace process and an
envisaged gateway for multinational investment, is also putting
up 10 million dollars worth of projects for partnerships.
</P>
<P>
The co-organizers, Egypt and the World Economic Forum, will
place a premium on interactive debates and offer a maximum amount
of time for networking and match-making for the 3,500
representatives from some 78 states, 53 international and
regional bodies during the three-day economic event.
</P>
<P>
A complex gamut of activities from such major topic as "peace
and economic development" to an in-depth examination of the
Palestinian economy, from industry workshops to project
presentations, will allow participants to pursue new business and
partnership opportunities as well as the regional projects
already agreed upon during the Casablanca and Amman conferences.

<P>
It is widely hoped that the kind of image-building and
networking will ensure the conference's success and offset any
negative effects of a seemly-stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
If all factors fall in place, big buck should stop here.
</P>
<P>
But as the organizers conclude their preparations and the
delegates get ready, politics and economy found themselves to be
uneasy bed-fellows.
</P>
<P>
Besides Hebron troop redeployment, an issue that has been a
bone of contention between Palestinian and Israeli negotiators
for months, the Lebanese and Syrian tracks are also stuck due to
the Israeli intransigence on keeping Arab lands and renegotiating
the concluded accords.
</P>
<P>
It is feared that Mideast cooperation would be more a fiction
than fact without a breakthrough in the peace process and with
the absence of trust, since the success of cooperation largely
hinges on taking Israel to the Arab pack.
</P>
<P>
When the countdown of the Cairo conference is ticking to the
end, maybe it is just wise to stress the bright side.
</P>
<P>
Looking back, the annual economic conferences did succeed in
promoting economic cooperation when they brought the Israelis and
Arabs together and decided upon the establishment of several
regional financial and economic institutions.
</P>
<P>
What's more important, the Arab regimes expect the convocation
of the conference will speed up their economic reforms, encourage
privatization and the role of the market. The June Arab Summit
sounded a notable change of tone: a dynamic interaction between
politics and economics.
</P>
<P>
The stumbling blocks littered on the path to peace will not
necessarily preclude the promotion of inter-Arab cooperation as
well as bilateral partnerships during MENA III.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the 900 or so business leaders from America,
Europe and Asia are eager to pitch in.
</P>
<P>
When everything taken into account, it seems a successful MENA
III depends on to what extent the interplay of market forces can
coexist with ill political feelings.
</P>
<P>
So, even if it is no big time for business now, it is still
worthwhile to give Mideast cooperation a chance.
</P>
<P>
When Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said, "at least I
don't think it (the conference) will throw away the peace
process," he exactly drew the bottom line.

precautionary measure for the crisis in neighboring Zaire, the
Agence France Presse (AFP) quoted official sources as saying today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the deployment had nothing to do with an
envisaged dispatch by the United Nations of a multinational force
to the Kivu region of eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The 120 French troops will be deployed close to Kinshasa, which
is a stone's throw from Brazzaville across the Congo River, and
which has been plunged into a political turmoil, with widespread
anti-government protests still going on.
</P>
<P>
The deployment of the French soldiers, who are based in
Libreville, Gabon, has been agreed upon by the Congolese
government, said AFP.
</P>
<P>
France has no defense treaties with Zaire and Congo, although
it has a strong military presence in central Africa, with 1,500
soldiers in the Central African Republic, 800 in Chad and 600 in
Gabon.
</P>
<P>
None of the French military units stationed in Africa has been
put on alert, according to local media reports.

<HEADLINE> OAU Urges UN to Take Lead in Solving Zairean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of
African Unity (OAU) today Urged the United Nations to bear the
cost of any peacekeeping force and humanitarian aid to refugees
in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council decision that the peacekeeping cost
should be borne by the participating countries... would naturally
make it difficult for African countries to take part in this
effort," Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi said here today.
</P>
<P>
He was addressing the opening session of Central Organ of the
OAU Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution.
</P>
<P>
Last week, a summit of regional leaders in Nairobi called for
a "neutral force" to be set up and funded by the UN Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
"It is indeed a pity that when African countries have shown a
clear disposition to fulfill their responsibilities and take the
lead on matters affecting them directly, they are being denied an
effective means to do this by the international community," Meles
declared.
</P>
<P>
France has proposed setting up a multi-national force,
combined of troops from the United States, the European Union and
African countries, to be deployed in crisis-torn eastern Zaire to
create "safe corridors" for some 1.2 million Hutu refugees, who
had fled their camps because of fighting between Tutsi rebels and
the Zairean government troops.
</P>
<P>
The United States is still hesitating over whether it should
participate in such a force.

<HEADLINE> He Luli Newly Elected Chairman of Revolutionary Committee of Chinese Kuomintang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 11 (Xinhua) -- He Luli was elected new
Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang
(RCCK) today in Beijing. The post became vacant because of Li
Peiyao's unfortunate death in February this year.
</P>
<P>
The election result was announced at the Fifth Plenary Session
of the Eighth Central Committee of the RCCK this afternoon. It
brought a lengthy ovation from the participants.
</P>
<P>
The RCCK was founded in Hong Kong in 1948, and is one of the
eight democratic parties in China, occupying an important position
in the country's political and social life, especially in its
reunification efforts.
</P>
<P>
Li Jishen served as its first chairman, followed by He
Xiangning, Zhu Yunshan, Wang Kunlun, Qu Wu, Zhu Xuefan, and then
Li Peiyao became Chairman of the RCCK.
</P>
<P>
He Luli, who is also vice-chairman of the National Committee of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said that
she will carry on the glorious tradition of the predecessors, and
create a new situation for the RCCK's work.
</P>
<P>
She said the reunification of the motherland is a common
aspiration of the people throughout the country, including Taiwan
compatriots, and also the unfulfilled wish of Dr. Sun Yat-sen,
founder of the Chinese Kuomintang.
</P>
<P>
The RCCK will, as always, conduct resolute struggles against
the splittist forces on and out of the Taiwan Island and make
common efforts to fulfil this sacred historic mission, together
with the compatriots across the Taiwan Straits, she said.
</P>
<P>
The 62-year-old He Luli was a paediatrician at the Children's
Hospital of Beijing and other hospitals for 27 years. Now she
still can skillfully give vaccinations to children.
</P>
<P>
In 1984, she served as deputy head of the Xicheng District of
the Beijing Municipality. She took up the post of vice-mayor of
Beijing in 1988, and then served as vice-chairman of the RCCK and
vice-president of the All-China Women's Federation.
</P>
<P>
He Luli's father, He Siyuan was mayor of Beiping city in 1946,
and made important contributions to the peaceful liberation of the
city. When He Luli grew up she carried on her father's cause. As
vice-mayor of the Beijing Municipality, she is mainly in charge of
social welfare and family planning work, and always shares
residents' ups and downs.
</P>
<P>
In her spare time, she likes to play tennis and is a member of
a women's tennis team, composed of Chen Muhua, vice-chairman of
the National People's Congress Standing Committee, and Wu Yi,
minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation. At the end of

<HEADLINE> Laos' Rice Harvest Falls Short of Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The yield of Laos' current rain
season rice amounts to only 1.42 million tons, 16.2 percent less
than the target of 1.7 million tons, the Lao official news agency
KPL reported today.
</P>
<P>
The drop was attributed to the unfavorable weather conditions
and natural disasters which struck the Southeastern Asian nation
this year.
</P>
<P>
Initial estimates of damage show that 89,710 hectares of paddy
fields in 16 provinces were flooded, 68,680 hectares of which now
can generate nothing at all.
</P>
<P>
Another 6,390 hectares of slash-and-burn cultivation have also
been damaged, with 3,189 hectares of rice-growing fields ravaged
by pests.
</P>
<P>
In order to restore production and to improve people's living
conditions, the Ministry of Agriculture-Forestry of Laos is
drafting a plan for the 1996-1997 dry season production on 60,000
hectares, of which 30,000 hectares will be used for growing rice
and the rest for cash crops.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the dry-season rice harvest will produce
120,000 tons, exceeding the previous year's production by 48,500
tons.

<HEADLINE> Somali Narcotics Stage Protest Against Price Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of angry and
shouting narcotics took to the streets of south Mogadishu
yesterday and today to protest against the sharp rise of the
narcotic leaves of khat.
</P>
<P>
The price of the narcotic leaves which are widely chewed in
Somalia has risen from about 1.5 U.S. Dollars a bundle to 4.5
U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Similar demonstrations were staged two days ago in Hargeisa,
the capital city of the break away republic of Somaliland, by
both the khat business community and the consumers.
</P>
<P>
But the price hike is delightful news for many other Somalis.
"It's good job that my husband can't afford to buy it now," said
Mrs Zahra Ahmed Ali.
</P>
<P>
"I wish if it would disappear from the surface of the world,"
she told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Khat is believed to be posing the harshest threat to the
existence of the Somali families. "It destroys the families
economically and causes rapid divorces or it makes the husband
impotent and there the co-living ends again," said Dr Liban
Mohamed baranbaro.
</P>
<P>
More than nine Cesna planes loaded with khat arrive in
Mogadishu and approximately 3,000 U.S. Dollars are spent
on the narcotic every day.
</P>
<P>
The khat consumption has been increasing especially in
southern Somalia for the past six years. Street fighters don't go
for fighting if they are not provided with a bundle of khat and
at least ten plieces of cigarettes each.

<HEADLINE> Australian Ex-PM Keating Lashes at Racist Comments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Former Australian Prime
Minister Paul Keating tonight criticized the coalition government
for not showing leadership in the recent nationwide debate over
immigration and aborigine communities.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Liberal-National coalition government to assume
its responsibility to "protect the national interest against the
tide of prejudice."
</P>
<P>
"If multicultural Australia, and with it our hard-won good name
for tolerance and fair play, falls over ... it will be because the
government has stopped pedaling," he told University of New South
Wales in Sydney during his second address as a visiting professor
tonight.
</P>
<P>
A national debate has been going on in the past few months
since former Liberal Party member Pauline Hanson attacked
Australia's immigration policy in the Federal Parliament, saying
Australians were "swamped" by Asians and calling for a stop to
migrant intake.
</P>
<P>
Keating said the "shamelessly regressive politics" of Hanson
were rooted in ignorance, prejudice and fear, which projected the
"ugly face of racism."
</P>
<P>
He described Hanson's comments as dangerously divisive and
deeply hurtful to many of her fellow Australians.
</P>
<P>
Local media had been focused on Prime Minister John Howard's
refusal to condemn Hanson's comments.
</P>
<P>
Newspapers and magazines urged Howard to assume his
responsibility as the national leader to provide the people with
accurate information about racial tolerance, as opposed to "the
rubbish they get from Hanson."
</P>
<P>
Local political commentator Laurie Oakes wrote that on this
issue, Howard had shown the worst leadership lapse from any prime
minister in the past three decades.
</P>
<P>
Keating did not mention by name Howard, who defeated him to
take the prime minister's office in the federal election in May
this year.
</P>
<P>
However, Keating said the responsibility for advancing the
nation's interest in tolerance and multiculturalism would rest on
the head of nobody but the government.
</P>
<P>
He said the government should have not allowed the
anti-immigration debate to break out.
</P>
<P>
"The great tragedy is that it perpetrates a myth, a fantasy, a
lie. The myth of the monoculture. The lie that we can retreat to
it," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the White Australia policy had not been
changed, "Australia would today be -- deservedly -- an
international pariah, and in every way a much poorer country."
</P>
<P>
The Federal Parliament had passed a bipartisan resolution on
racial tolerance last month, six weeks after the nationwide debate
broke out.

LUANDA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO) has said it is hard for Africa to get financial
compensation for slave trading in colonial history.
</P>
<P>
This was declared here today by Doudou Diene, director of
UNESCO's Training Department, at the third international
conference of the Roads of Slaves, an education plan drawn up by
UNESCO in Benin in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Organization of African Unity (OAU) had demanded
that African countries be financially compensated for the slave
trading conducted by some colonial powers in Africa's dark days.
</P>
<P>
Diene said Africans might feel "morally, spiritually and
politically compensated" as a wide range of books published
internationally have shown sympathy with Africa in its suffering
from slave trade.
</P>
<P>
It is hard to compensate since the scale of the trade is
considered so big, according to the UNESCO official.
</P>
<P>
The fourth annual Road of Slaves international conference will
be held in Guinea in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Reassures Arafat Over Oslo Accords </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu Sunday night telephoned Palestinian Authority
(PA) President Yasser Arafat, in an effort to move the Hebron
negotiations forward.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported this morning that the call followed a
meeting the previous night between Arafat and Netanyahu's
advisers Dore Gold and Yitzhak Molcho.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Arafat reportedly requested that Netanyahu
personally assure him that Israel remains committed to the Oslo
peace accords with the Palestinians and will implement them
fully.
</P>
<P>
The report said Netanyahu assured Arafat of Israel's
commitment, but pointed out that unless there were proper
security safeguards for the Jewish settlers in the West Bank
city of Hebron, there would be an explosion of the situation.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also urged Arafat to conclude the redeployment
agreement, saying Arafat's "foot-dragging is enabling both
Israeli and Palestinians extremists to sabotage the entire
agreement."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, sources in Jerusalem described as "unfounded" the
reports that a Hebron agreement would be signed in Egypt this
week, when a regional economic conference will be held.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Israel media said that the unannounced
target date for signing an agreement on Israeli army redeployment
in Hebron is November 12 in Cairo, capital of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that US Secretary of State Warren
Christopher will head a U.S. delegation to mark the signing of
the accord between Israel and Palestine.
</P>
<P>
The accord, according to Israeli media, would promote the
expansion of economic ties between Arab countries and Israel,
which have been halted since the establishment of the new Israeli
government in July.
</P>
<P>
According to the Oslo accords, the Israeli army was
originally supposed to complete its redeployment in the Hebron
area by March 28, pulling back from approximately 80 percent of
the city.
</P>
<P>
However, following a series of suicide bombing attacks in
Israel late February and early March which left more than 60
people dead and some 100 wounded, former Prime Minister Shimon
Peres delayed the redeployment.
</P>
<P>
In last May, the previous Israeli government announced that
the army's withdrawal from Hebron would be carried out after the
May 29 general election, due to security reasons.
</P>
<P>
However, Peres, defeated by Likud chairman Netanyahu in the
elections, said afterwards that he would leave the decision of
the redeployment to the new prime minister and his government.
</P>
<P>
Hebron, some 30 kilometers southwest of Jerusalem, is a place
of pilgrimage for Christians, Jews and Moslems alike, and
tradition has it that patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their
wives are all buried in the Machpelah Cave (Haram al-Khalil).
</P>
<P>
There are some 400 Jewish settlers now living in the center of
Hebron, who moved back to the city's old Jewish neighborhood
after the 1967 War, during which Israel took over the city from
the Jordanian authority.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, surrounding the Jewish community, there are more
than 120,000 Palestinian residents living in most other parts of
the city.
</P>
<P>
During his election campaign, Netanyahu said that he would
like Hebron to be part of the final status arrangements with the
Palestinians, but, at the same time, he also said he would stand
by the international agreements.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Israel and Palestine started a new round
of continual talks on the Israeli army's redeployment in Hebron,
which had already been delayed for more than half a year.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Israel insisted on changes in the security
arrangements contained in the Oslo accords, in light of the
violent confrontations between Israelis and Palestinians in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip in September.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the confrontations, which had included
exchanges of fires between Israeli troops and Palestinian
police, U.S. President Bill Clinton called for an emergency
summit in Washington to resuscitate the peace process.
</P>
<P>
As one of the few results of the summit, the Israelis and
Palestinians agreed to hold round-the-clock talks, in an attempt
to resolve their differences.
</P>
<P>
However, after four weeks of talks, with the participation of
U.S. special Middle East coordinator Dennis Ross and other
U.S. officials, Israel and Palestine failed to complete a deal on
the Hebron redeployment.

NEW DELHI, November 11 (Xinhua) -- India's annual inflation
rate rose marginally to 6.57 percent for the week ending October
26, the Press Trust of India said today.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate, which gained 0.6 percentage points during
the week under review, stood at 8.4 percent during the
corresponding period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The increase in inflation is attributed to higher prices of
commodities such as fruit and vegetables, the report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The football team of war-torn
Liberia Sunday lost 0-1 to visiting Tunisia in its opening World
Cup qualifier in Accra, Ghana, according to a report on Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, the decider of the match was scored in the 90th minute
by substitute Zalassi Riadh with a header off a corner, the
newspaper "Vanguard" here said.
</P>
<P>
World Footballer George Weah put everything he had to lift
Liberia but failed to see them through in the match.
</P>
<P>
It was particularly difficult for the AC Milan striker who had
to double as coach and player in this match which Liberia played
as home team but away from home.
</P>
<P>
Worse still, according to the report, Weah could not play his
traditional attacking position because of weakness in the Liberian
defense. He therefore had to combine roles as midfielder, defender
and occasionally as attacker.
</P>
<P>
Liberia has been suffering from a six-and-a-half year civil war
that has resulted in great destruction of its infrastructure,
including sports facilities.

<HEADLINE> 50,000 People Flee Fighting in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 11 (Xinhua) -- About 50,000 people were
displaced over the past week in the wake of fierce factional
fighting in western Afghanistan, said a press release issued by
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) here today.
</P>
<P>
The release said around 45,000 people from small towns and
villages in front-line areas in Badghis Province fled southward to
Qala-i-Nau, capital of Badghis Province.
</P>
<P>
Another 2,000 to 3,000 people proceeded further south to Herat,
the capital city of Herat Province which borders Badghis, the
release said.
</P>
<P>
Heavy fighting between the Taliban Militia led by Mullah Umer
and the Uzbek Militia led by Rashid Dostum erupted in Badghis at
the end of last month and is still raging on.
</P>
<P>
"More people are arriving in Herat every day, some after
walking for several days and nights," the release said.
</P>
<P>
A UNHCR camp set up in Herat last Wednesday is already full
while a new one is filling up fast.
</P>
<P>
Those arriving in Herat said that due to heavy shelling and
aerial bombardments, many people left their homes so hurriedly
that they were unable to bring any belongings with them.
</P>
<P>
Some of the women and children are reported to be in poor
condition.
</P>
<P>
A 22-truck U.N. convoy was sent from Herat to Qala-i-Nau on
Saturday, carrying 400 family tents and 7,500 blankets as well as
149 tons of food and five tons of high-protein biscuits.
</P>
<P>
The refugees in Herat are also receiving tents, blankets and
food from the U.N. agencies.
</P>
<P>
Last week, some 6,000 to 7,000 Afghan refugees attempted to
escape the fighting on the western front by crossing the border
into Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more than 9,000 displaced people are concentrated
in the northern part of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Around 15,000 people coming from Kabul have crossed the border
into Pakistan since the beginning of October when the Taliban
began to fight with the ousted government troops led by Ahmad Shah
Masood north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
More than 1 million Afghan refugees are staying in Pakistan and
1.4 million in Iran, although 3.8 million Afghan refugees have
returned home since 1989 when Soviet troops withdrew from the
country.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Bangladesh Facing Fresh Political </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After its parliamentary party meeting Sunday evening, the
opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) announced that it
would abstain from the house with effect from the day till its
10-point demand was met.
</P>
<P>
The BNP is asking the government to let it play its due role as
opposition in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The BNP alleged that the ruling party, the Awami league (AL),
"is interested in keeping the opposition in the house only to give
legitimacy to its activities." "The ministers and the Treasury
Bench MPs are delivering unilateral statements attacking the
opposition MPs while the opposition party is deprived of its right
to reply," they noted.
</P>
<P>
But observers here said that the BNP's allegation is just an
excuse for launching street campaign against the government.
</P>
<P>
As the first step to maintain law and order in the country,
the government has launched a massive recovery of illegal arms
since late June when it was installed after winning the June 12
parliamentary elections. The BNP has condemned the government's
actin, alleging that many BNP leaders and workers, especially
those in university campuses, have been harassed, detained,
attacked or killed by the police and AL activists in the name of
recovery of illegal arms.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some BNP leaders, former ministers and top officials
of the ex-government of BNP as well as their relatives including a
son and a brother of BNP chief Begum Khaleda Zia have been
involved in corruption cases.
</P>
<P>
Further more, the government is determined to try all killers
of the father of the nation Sheikh Mujibur Rahman who was
assassinated during a military coup on August 15, 1975 along with
all of his family members except his two daughters including the
present Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Some retired pro-BNP army
officers are allegedly involved in the assassination of Mujibur
and some of his cabinet colleagues have been arrested for trial.
</P>
<P>
All these have demonstrated that the ruling party and its
government is bent on eliminating the BNP by arresting its
leaders, a BNP leader said, adding that "we must fight back
instead of awaiting our doom."
</P>
<P>
BNP chief Khaleda had called for vigorous united mass movement
against the "subservient government with high-sounding excuses".
"We had earlier thought of giving the government time. But, the
existence of the country and lives of the people are at stake due
to misrule and treachery during the last four and a half months of
its rule," she said.
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the BNP has changed its strategy towards the
government. By boycotting the parliament, the BNP is actually
bringing the country towards fresh political crisis.
</P>
<P>
Before holding the 7th parliamentary elections, the country had
experienced two-year long political disturbances due to the then
government-opposition conflict between the BNP and the AL. The
people suffered a lot with thousands of people died in violent
street action including strikes, sieges, blockades, rallies and
demonstrations called by the then opposition AL.
</P>
<P>
Accusing the opposition BNP of leading the country towards
fresh confrontation, Prime minister Hasina urged the abstainers to
go back to the parliament and "giving up the path of violence" to
help ensure sustained development of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
"The people, not the opposition, are the deciding factor about
the tenure of the government," Hasina said, questioning that 'who
has given them the right to speak like not-giving any more time to
the government?"+
</P>
<P>
However, accusation against each other can not save the country
from political crisis. Dialogue is the only way to solve problems,
analysis here pointed out.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea to Force Former President Choi to Appear in Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Seoul High Court decided
today to force former South Korean President Choi Kyu-hah to
testify in the appeal trial for the 1979 military coup and the
1980 military crackdown on the Kwangju civil uprising.
</P>
<P>
Choi has refused to heed previous court orders to show up as a
witness in the trial involving two other former presidents, Chun
Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo.
</P>
<P>
Choi was a caretaker president between the assassination of
presidential strongman Park Chung-hee in 1979 and Chun's violent
grab for power.
</P>
<P>
Chief Judge Kwon Sung of the Seoul High Court said that his
court will order a detention of Choi on November 14 to force him
to testify in the appeal trial if he keeps refusing to appear in
court by today.
</P>
<P>
"We have even proposed that Choi testify in a neutral place,
but our efforts to persuade him to testify voluntarily have
failed," Kwon said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Choi, stepped down in August 1980 shortly before
then army general Chun took office, presented a notice of absence
for the court trial, explaining that there is no change in his
conviction that it is undesirable for a former president to
testify in court.
</P>
<P>
He said that he will continue to refuse testifying even if he
is forced to take the stand in court.
</P>
<P>
The appeal trial of former Presidents Chun and Roh began at the
Seoul High Court on October 7 over guilty verdicts handed down
against them for mutiny and treason.
</P>
<P>
On August 26, the Seoul District Court sentenced Chun to death
and Roh to 22 years and six months in prison respectively on
charges of mutiny, treason and bribery.
</P>
<P>
It also fined Chun 282 million U.S. dollars and Roh 355 million
dollars, representing the bribes they allegedly accumulated while
in office.
</P>
<P>
Chun and Roh appealed to the Seoul High Court on August 30.
</P>
<P>
The mutiny and treason charges stem from the roles played by
Chun and Roh and their cronies in the military coup on December
12, 1979 and the suppression of the civil uprising in Kwangju,
capital of South Korea's South Cholla Province, on May 18, 1980.
</P>
<P>
Chun seized power on August 27, 1980 and ruled the nation until
February 1988. He was followed by his friend, Roh, who stepped
down in February 1993.

<HEADLINE> India Facing Greater Trade Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 11 (Xinhua) -- India's trade deficit may
widen if the slump in export growth continues and jeopardizes the
balance of payment position, the Press Trust of India reported
today, quoting a paper released by the Federation of Indian
Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI).
</P>
<P>
"Unless remedial steps are taken expeditiously, the balance of
payment position is likely to pose a new threat, not experienced
during the last four years of economic reforms," said the paper --
"Reversing the Current Deceleration".
</P>
<P>
The country's export slowdown is caused more by impediments on
the supply side relating to inputs and infrastructure than by the
shrinking growth rate of the world trade, said the FICCI paper.
</P>
<P>
India's industry and exports have suffered a slowdown in growth
in recent months, triggering fears for a possible economic
recession in the country.
</P>
<P>
In addition to removing hurdles on the infrastructure sector,
the government has to put in place a right policy package to
mitigate the current malaise afflicting the Indian economy, the
chamber said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the slump in export growth has gone hand in hand
with slowdown in basic economic activities, the chamber warned
that the industrial production would decelerate to around seven
percent this year against 12.4 percent in the fiscal year of
1995-96.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that India's recent sluggish export performance
is caused more by internal problems than by external factors.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Set Chemical Standards for Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will set standards
for chemical contents in its farm exports to ensure that foreign
buyers have confidence in its raw and processed agricultural
products.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives has
decided to draft the standards following allegations that some
Thai farm exports contain chemical residue.
</P>
<P>
Pitipong Pungbun Na Ayudhya, a deputy permanent secretary of
the ministry, denied that Thai rice contained dangerous chemicals.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Somboon Phathaichan, manager of the Thai Rice Export
Association, described the allegations as unfair and said they had
come mainly from foreign rivals aiming to damage Thai rice
exports.
</P>
<P>
He said his association always tested the quality of export
rice because if the standard was unsatisfactory markets would be
lost.
</P>
<P>
Verapan Sriboonlue, director of the ministry's information
division, also dismissed a Wall Street Journal report that a
farmer in Suphanburi Province, central Thailand, used a chemical
called sodium hydrosulfite, normally used in the textile industry,
to bleach truffles before sending them for canning.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Security Forces Thwart Bombing Attack: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian security forces
last month thwarted a suicide bombing attack in Israel by a
16-year-old Palestinian boy from the Gaza Strip, Israel Radio
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Amir Peretz, Labor Party member of the
Knesset (Israel's parliament), as saying that Islamic Jihad had
offered the boy 50,000 U.S. dollars to carry out the attack.
</P>
<P>
Peretz, chairman of the Histadrut, told Israel Radio that
this was revealed by Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
President Yasser Arafat Sunday during a meeting with a visiting
Histadrut delegation in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
PNA Justice Minister Freih Abu Medein, who also participated
in the meeting, told the visitors that the boy's mother had
contacted Palestinian security officials out of fear for his
life.
</P>
<P>
Abu Medein said that the Islamic Jihad offered the boy 50,000
U.S. dollars, a huge sum in Gaza, to carry out the attack, and
that was in addition to brainwashing they put him through.
</P>
<P>
Abu Medein mentioned the worse economic circumstances in the
Palestinian self-rule areas, saying that the boy's father has
been out of work for over a year because of the closure imposed
by Israel on the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Abu Medein said that Arafat had given the family a check for
5,000 dollars and found work for the father with the PNA.
</P>
<P>
However, Abu Medein said that if the closure continues, there
would be more cases like this, which the PNA would not be able to
stop in time.
</P>
<P>
The eight-month-long closure, imposed following a series of
suicide bombing attacks in Israel which left more than 60 dead
and over 100 injured, has barred tens of thousands of
Palestinian workers from returning to their jobs in Israel.
</P>
<P>
PNA sources estimated that the Palestinians are losing some 6
million dollars daily due to the closure, which has brought more
difficulties to the already troubled economy in the Palestinian
autonomous areas.

JERUSALEM, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli army has put
Israeli-developed armor plating around the U.S.-built Humvee and
plans to use the jeep-like vehicle in its self-styled security
zone in south Lebanon, reported The Jerusalem Post today.
</P>
<P>
The first armored Humvee, known as the Hamar in Hebrew, was
shown to military reporters Sunday. Security sources said the
vehicle is bulletproof and able to absorb shrapnel.
</P>
<P>
Israeli defense officials said the Hamar, which cost 410,000
shekels (some 135,000 U.S. dollars) each and are assembled by the
army's Ordnance Corps, will be the first to be deployed on an
active war front.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, Israel has developed an advanced,
new generation anti-armor weapon, believed to be code-named
Spike, which is able to penetrate tanks and APCs fitted with
top-of-the-line protection.
</P>
<P>
The Spike has a fire-and-forget capability and can also be
fired at a target even if it cannot be seen by the launch
position by using a fiber optic data link. It is said to have
pinpoint accuracy.
</P>
<P>
It also has a tandem, or double high-explosive anti-tank
warhead, so it can penetrate tanks and other armored vehicles
equipped with explosive reactive armor.

187,000 U.S. dollars in bribes in April last year from Daewoo
Heavy Industries Company which asked for a state license to take

<HEADLINE> Kuwait to Pay Last Instalment of Loan for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait will be able to
clear its international debts borrowed to cover the 1991 Gulf War
costs before the end of this year, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
The last instalment of 800 million U.S. dollars that falls
due according to the amortization schedule for the Kuwait state
loan would be settled in December 1996, the Governor of the
Central Bank of Kuwait Sheikh Salem Al-Sabah Revealed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was the last instalment of the loan borrowed
by Kuwait in the wake of the Gulf War in 1991 from certain
international financial institutions to meet the liberation
costs.
</P>
<P>
The loans totaled 5.5 billion dollars and the repayment
schedule was amortized into ten bi-annual instalments.
</P>
<P>
The governor said quick recovery of the Kuwait economy
following the Gulf War and good performance thereafter
contributed much to the settlement of the debt on time and the
settlement of the last instalment along with accrued interest on
schedule by Kuwait would reinforce international confidence in
the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
He stated that the Kuwaiti economy has recovered and
registered a growth of 8.2 percent in 1995 compared to 1.6
percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The monetary sector realized a growth estimated at 10 percent
while the non-monetary sector's growth was estimated at 6
percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said the year 1995 witnessed an increase in
money supply by 9.4 percent compared to 1994. The total money
supply amounted to 7.3 billion Kuwait dinars (24.09 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate of the Kuwaiti dinar vis-a-vis the
U.S. dollar remained stable.
</P>
<P>
National savings were estimated at 1.814 billion dinars
(5.986 billion dollars), providing evidence that the Kuwait
economy has reverted to its position before the Iraqi invasion of
the country in August 1990, he indicated.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Kuwait trade balance of payment recorded a
surplus of 3.944 billion dollars in 1995 comparing to a deficit
at 7.376 billion dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwait stock exchange market has also witnessed brisk
trading performance with the share index keeping soaring during
the past several months, another sign of the increased
confidence in the national economy, he said.

relations between the CPC and the FMNLF.
</P>
<P>
Li also briefed the guests on the remarkable changes that have
taken place in China during its 18-year reform and opening up
period. These changes have shown that China should stick to
socialism while gradually improving its socialist system as the
situation changes, Li noted.
</P>
<P>
Ceren said that the FMNLF places great importance on its
friendship with the CPC, and said he believes that his visit will
help promote relations between the two parties and even between
the two countries.

percent (18 recent for spacing, 11 percent for limiting births),
the report added.
</P>

<P>
In addition, childhood illness levels are highly characterized
by fevers, diarrhoea and vomiting, the report said, adding that
many children survive with low disease immunity and enter
adulthood with poor health.

JERUSALEM, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat met with visiting EU troika delegation
headed by Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring in Gaza Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
Arafat told the European guests that the Palestinians want
Europe to play a greater role in the Middle East peace process,
which is just the aim of the troika's current tour of the region.
</P>
<P>
Spring said after the meeting that EU wants the
Israeli-Palestinian peace agreements to be implemented quickly
without any change.

The EU troika delegation arrived in Gaza from Jordan on their
third leg of the visit, which began in Syria and will take it to
Egypt.

lack of momentum in the peace process. We want the momentum
back ... we want to see agreements being reached for the
withdrawal of troops from Hebron."

Spring, whose country holds the rotating presidency of the
15-nation EU, was accompanied by Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van
Mierlo and Italian diplomat Amedeo de Franchis, who represents
Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini.
</P>
<P>
The troika delegation canceled its originally-planned visit to
Israel due to disagreement over Israel's opposition to its
meeting with Palestinian officials in East Jerusalem's Orient
House, PLO's office in the city.
</P>
<P>
But the delegation is scheduled to meet with Israeli Foreign
Minister David Levy in Cairo. Levy will be in the Egyptian

<HEADLINE> Mbeki Not Heir Apparent, Says Mandela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 11 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela yesterday stunned the highest decision-making body
of the African National Congress (ANC), the National Executive
Committee (NEC), when he surprisingly announced that he had not
chosen his Deputy Thabo Mbeki as heir apparent to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the two-day NEC meeting in Johannesburg, Mandela
told delegates he had not endorsed Mbeki as the next party
leader, saying it was a decision for the party, but not himself,
to make when he retires in 1999, local leading newspapers said
today.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said: "There has been a perception that I have already
chosen my successor. There is talk that Comrade Mbeki is the heir
apparent but all this is not true. I have not chosen anyone to
take over. The whole matter is in the hands of the ANC."
</P>
<P>
According to the newspapers, all the NEC members participating
in the meeting were shocked by Mandela's announcement because the
president had never shown any reservation on Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki, who currently in Europe on a 10-nation tour, has been
welcomed as the heir apparent to the presidency when Mandela
steps down in 1999 at the end of his first term.
</P>
<P>
However, Mandela said the ANC was an organization which
believes in collective leadership. The President to this effect
had no right to choose a successor and "I never did so", he
declared.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the possible presidential candidates, Mandela said the
ANC had a number of competent, gifted and experienced leaders. "Any
one of them could qualify," he added.
</P>
<P>
But Mandela pledged he would support Mbeki if he was elected
as ANC president at the party's next national conference in 1997,
saying Mbeki is a competent man who deserves that position.
</P>
<P>
According to newspapers, apart from Mbeki, possible presidential
candidates includes Mpumalanga Premier Mathews Phosa, Gauteng Premier
Tokyo Sexwale, outgoing ANC Secretary-general Cyril Ramaphosa, and ANC
National Chairman Jacob Zuma.

<HEADLINE> Large Profits From China's New Scientific Research Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Some state science and
technology research projects from the 1991-1995 period have
brought 60 billion yuan (7.5 billion U.S. dollars) in
profits. These projects cover agriculture, raw materials,
equipment, energy, communications, new technology, light textiles,
and social development.
</P>
<P>
A multimedia network giving access to the state's major science
and technology developments over the past five years will be shown
at Beijing's Great Hall of the People tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Deng Nan, deputy minister of the State Science and Technology
Commission said in Beijing that from 1991 to 1995 China put more
than nine billion yuan into 180 major state science research
projects, resulting in over 60,000 scientific and technological
findings.
</P>
<P>
Some 80 percent of China's crops use new seed strains, and new
varieties of rice, wheat, and corn can add 30 billion kilograms of
grain each year. Deng said that dry land improvements in the
northern part of China and in low-yield land in the south have
added output of six billion kilograms of grain over the past five
years.
</P>
<P>
Breakthroughs in oil and gas exploration have also helped China
find some large and medium-sized oil and gas fields. In the Tarim
Basin in northeastern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, nine large
or medium-sized oil and gas fields were found, with 500 million
tons in proven oil reserve and 600 billion cubic meters of gas.
</P>
<P>
China has also seen improvements in the design and manufacture
of equipment for large open pit mines, large thermal power plants,
and heavily-loaded freight trains.
</P>
<P>
The country has had a number of other achievements in
integrated circuitry, computer software, telecommunications, and
digitally-controlled systems.
</P>
<P>
In the field of medicine, China has made advances in the
prevention and treatment of tumors, cardiovascular diseases, viral
hepatitis, and other major diseases. Life expectancy in China has
gone from 68 years five years ago to 70 now.
</P>
<P>
China began to implement its plan of tackling key problems in
science and technology in 1982, and it now focuses on major
problems in national economic and social development.

<HEADLINE> International Seminar on Tungsten Market Held in Nanchang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The price of tungstens is
expected to recover by the end of this year or early next year,
according to the world's major tungsten producers.
</P>
<P>
Experts in the field, who attended a three-day seminar on
tungsten mines recently in Nanchang, the capital of Jiangxi
Province, said that the price of fine tungsten ore has been
falling since 1994, forcing many of the world's tungsten mines to
cut production, with some even suspending it.
</P>
<P>
They said they believe that the serious decrease in Russia's
demand for tungsten and the dumping of many countries' tungsten
reserves on the world market, in addition to lack of controls on
tungsten output from collectively-owned mines in China are the
main factors for supply exceeding demand in the world's tungsten
market.
</P>
<P>
They suggested that all tungsten producing countries take the
initiative in reducing production and sale of the ore for a quick
recovery in the market. So far, however, only a small number of
those countries have adopted the practical measure of limiting
output of fine ore.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has taken the step of purchasing 3,000
tons of fine tungsten ore from state-owned mines which have
reduced their production of tungsten.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by 34 senior officials of tungsten
mines in China, Russia, The United States, Singapore, Portugal,
Viet Nam, Myanmar and Peru.

<HEADLINE> Banks in Shanghai Provide Better Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Citizens in Shanghai, China's
leading banking center, have begun to have a pleasant experience
when they do their banking now.
</P>
<P>
As Shanghai's development speeds up, the old style of banking
just did not satisfy customers' needs,
</P>
<P>
"More foreign banks have opened offices in Shanghai and become
strong competitors with local banks. Therefore, we had to improve
our services and provide satisfactory services," said.Chen Junde,
with the Huaihai Street Branch of the Industrial and Commercial
Bank of China, located in a busy part of downtown Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
"Seeing bank employees in neat uniforms gives me more trust in
banks," one local said happily, to which Chen adds, "As
specialized banks are changed to commercial ones, the competition
among banks becomes more intense. If we don't improve services,
we'll lose our market share."
</P>
<P>
In order to expand its market, the branch has added some new
services, such as foreign exchange deposits for locals, individual
checking, and stock information, in addition to training in
etiquette for both new and old employees.
</P>
<P>
The moves have scored some good results, with deposits climbing
to one billion yuan, against 300 million yuan two years ago.
</P>
<P>
This year, branches of all major banks, such as the Bank of
China, the Industrial and Commercial Bank, and the Construction
Bank of China, have come up with new measures to improve their
services.
</P>
<P>
one survey has shown that bank services provide satisfactory
services for customers, according to Chen.

in the 1950s, are still not out-of-date in the 1990s, even when
market competition is so strong.
</P>
<P>
Wang Guangying, vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress, said at today's meeting that young
people should contribute to the nation in this great period of
time by learning from role models.

<HEADLINE> Polluting Companies Closed To Keep Beijing's Water Clean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDE, November 11 (Xinhua) -- In the tourist city of Chengde,
to the north of the Chinese capital, 610 companies that were
causing pollution have been shut down to keep them from polluting
the water of nearby Beijing and Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
The Chaohe River, which flows through Chengde in Hebei
Province, provides 93 percent of the Panjiakou, and 57 percent of
the Miyun reservoir's water, the two main water suppliers for the
two most important cities in north China.
</P>
<P>
To protect these sources, the Chengdu City government has put a
special group in charge of polluters. Chengde's mayor, Fu Guiwu,
said, "In order to give Beijing and Tianjin's residents clean
water, those of us upstream are willing to suffer economic losses."
</P>
<P>
According to local figures, closing so many companies in
Chengde may result in more than 62 million yuan (about 7.5 million
US dollars) in losses annually.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the province of Liaoning also closed 63 small paper
mills, 14 dye manufacturers with an annual output of less
than 500 tons each, 49 tanneries, and more than 550 companies
involved in oil refining, gold extraction, and asbestos products.

ISTANBUL, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Turkey dominated the full
ninety minutes of their Group seven World Cup qualifying round
against San Marino on Sunday with an easy 7-0 win.
</P>
<P>
Striker Derelioglu Oktay, who plays with '94-'95 Turkish league
champions Besiktas, hammered home four of his team's seven goals.

<P>
He was well supported in his goal hunt by midfielders Kerimoglu
Tugay, Temizkanoglu Ogun and Ercan Abdullah, who ensured the
Turkish side dominated possession.
</P>
<P>
Striker Hakan Sukur, nick-named the "Bull of the Bosporus",
Turkey's internationally best-known player, scored twice in the
second half, but surprisingly missed a few opportunities.
</P>
<P>
San Marino, for their part, only tried to keep the ball out of
their penalty area as much as possible, making almost no efforts
to score.
</P>
<P>
Their goalkeeper Gaperoni, however, made five excellent saves,
preventing an even worse defeat for his side.

<P>
HARBIN, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Heilongjiang Province, one of
China's largest commodity grain production centers, had some
fairly low yields in the past, but has shown great progress thanks
to the use of foreign techniques.

The technique has been used on 180 million mu (10.8 million
hectares) of farmland all over the country, producing an
additional 10.9 billion kilograms of grain a year, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
The province's grain and cash crop output increased by seven
billion kilograms as a result of the use of imported techniques,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Joint Tire Venture In Northeast China Being Negotiated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Italy's Pirelli Group plans
to establish a joint tire venture in Jilin Province's Changchun
to produce 1.5 million radial tires annually.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, negotiations are entering the
final stage and results will be announced next month.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Changchun Song Chunhua, S. Taglioretti, chief

</P>
<P>
The Changchun Tire Factory has an annual production capacity of

</P>
<P>
As China's auto industry develops and more expressways are
built, the demand for radials grows. Radial producers are all

CITIC Pacific to establish Pirelli's first joint venture in Wuxi
City, in east China's Jiangsu Province.

<HEADLINE> Typhoon Leaves 16 Dead, 12 Missing in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Typhoon Ernie blew out of
northern Philippines Saturday night, leaving 16 dead, 5 injured
and 12 missing, according to disaster and weather authorities.
</P>
<P>
Ernie is heading toward the South China Sea, the Philippine
Atmosphere, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration
(PAGASA) said.
</P>
<P>
Ernie had unleashed heavy rains and flash floods to the Visayas
and Northern Mindanao since last week, driving about 5,000 out of
their homes and causing millions of pesos loss in agriculture and
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
At least two highways and a road were closed in the Visayas due
to floods and landslides.
</P>
<P>
President Fidel Ramos Sunday declared a state of calamity in 14
provinces and eight cities ravaged by Ernie, the 16th storm to
enter the country this year.
</P>
<P>
Ramos approved the release of 4.3 million pesos (16,400 US
dollars) from the Calamity Fund for relief and rescue operations.
</P>
<P>
He also directed National Defense Secretary Renato S. de Villa
to alert all regions, especially coastal areas, ships and
fishermen, in the path of another Typhoon, Dale.
</P>
<P>
Weathermen from the PAGASA said Dale is roaring closer to Luzon
Island, packing sustained winds of up to 175 kilometers per hour
and gusts of up to 210 kmh.
</P>
<P>
Dale, which could develop into a "super typhoon," is capable of
"uprooting trees and causing flash floods," they said.
</P>
<P>
But they added that there was a possibility that Dale will not
hit land unless it moves to the west.
</P>
<P>
As of 4 p.m. Sunday, Dale was moving northwest at 26 kmh toward
eastern Luzon and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Storm Signal No. 1 was hoisted over Batanes group of islands,
eastern section of Luzon, including Samar provinces. These areas
will have rains and winds of 30 to 60 kmh beginning Monday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine National Red Cross said it was preparing for
another massive disaster relief operation in the wake of Dale.
</P>
<P>
An average of 20 storms and typhoons hit the Philippines each
year.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Two persons have died and 62
others were hospitalized due to a suspected cholera outbreak in a
town in Negros Oriental province in southwestern Philippines,
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
"We are not certain yet as to what kind of disease that stalked
the area. However, we suspected that it is a cholera outbreak,"
said Dr. Felimon Flores, provincial health official, quoted by the
newspaper the Philippine Inquirer.
</P>

Flores said the disease erupted later last month in at least
eight villages in the town of Bayawan, where several cases of
cholera were reported a few months ago.

<HEADLINE> China Unicom to Gear Up Telecom Development in Fujian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, November 11 (Xinhua) -- A 500 million yuan spending
spree by a Beijing-based telecom giant has dialed success in
east China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
The money has been spent on a range of telecommunications
projects by China Unicom's branch in the province, giving new
impetus to the provincial telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
China Unicom -- the China United Telecommunications Corporation
-- is a major state-owed telecommunications company authorized by
the State Council, China's highest administrative body.
</P>
<P>
It was established by the Ministry of the Electronics Industry,
Ministry of the Power Industry and Ministry of Railways, as well
as being joined by 13 large state-owned enterprises, to provide
basic telecommunications services.
</P>
<P>
Projects funded with the 500 million yuan include the first
phase of construction of the provincial GSM network, switching
networks, and digital microwave transmission trunks linking Xiamen
with the provincial capital of Fuzhou.
</P>
<P>
The Fujian Unicom branch has imported mobile phone switchboards
from Germany's Siemens AG, and radio base stations from the US's
Motorola company, to open a GSM 130 network.
</P>
<P>
The network spans 11 cities and four counties, including
Fuzhou, Xiamen and Quanzhou.
</P>
<P>
Fujian Unicom aims to raise overseas funds to improve the
provincial telecom sector, by expanding coverage of mobile telecom
network, adding long-distance transmission lines, and building
telecom networks integrated with services such as cable TV, and
telephone and data transmission.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Reduce Products Tariffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines plans to bring
down tariffs on all products, except for rice and other "sensitive
agricultural products," traded with the rest of the Asia-Pacific
region to 5 percent in the next eight years, a local newspaper
said today.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines presented to the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum a detailed plan of liberalizing trade and
leveling the playing field to attract more foreign investors,
according to the Individual Action Plan (IAP) which was obtained
by the newspaper Today.
</P>
<P>
"The targeted final rate under the (Tariff Reform Program) is a
uniform rate of five percent by the year 2004, except to sensitive
agricultural products whose tariffs are set inter-alia per (World
Trade Organization) commitments," the document said.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, the Philippine government plans to reduce
tariff levels on petroleum products to 11.33 percent and the
tariff on chemical and photographic supplies to 4.61 percent. It
will also phase down tariffs imposed on countries carrying the
Most-Favored-Nation status.
</P>
<P>
Currently the Philippine government slaps an average tariff
rate of 15.57 percent on the different products entering the
country -- from as high as 27.43 percent on agricultural products,
except fish, to as low as 6.25 percent on non-electrical
machinery.
</P>
<P>
Under the action plan, rice will also be shielded with
non-tariff barriers. Other sensitive agricultural products,
petroleum products and new motor vehicles or trucks have been
stripped off the quota requirements since October last year.
</P>
<P>
The importation of metals, chemical and photographic supplies
and transport equipment will be less costly as import licensing
will eventually be lifted within the eight-year period.
</P>
<P>
On the energy sector, the Philippines projects that "all
regulations on oil price setting, including the Oil Price
Stabilization fund and the foreign exchange cover will be removed"
as the oil deregulation policy matures by the year 2000. The
regulations on the importation of coal will also be lifted by that
time.

<HEADLINE> Russia Vows to Track Down Bombers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin tonight demanded action against gangland bombers who
blew up a cemetery in Moscow killing 13 people and injuring 30.
</P>
<P>
Police have launched a major operation to hunt down the
perpetrators of Sunday's spectacular attack on mourners
commemorating the death of the leader of an Afghan war veterans
group.
</P>
<P>
"This (the incident) is a challenge to the Interior Ministry
and it cannot go unheeded," the prime minister said in a speech.
</P>
<P>
But the chances of the police catching the bombers are slim.
Russia has been swallowed up in a wave of violent organized crime
and mafia style killings have become commonplace since the
collapse of the Soviet Union and the ensuing economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Yet few bombings and gangland murders have been cleared up.
</P>
<P>
The explosion took place about noon (0900 GMT) while a funeral
ceremony was under way at the Kotlyakovaskoye cemetery in southern
Moscow to commemorate Mikhail Likhodei, the former head of the
Afghan War Invalids Foundation, who was murdered near his
apartment block on November 10, 1994.
</P>
<P>
Among those killed today were Likhodei's widow, mother and
uncle and his successor.
</P>
<P>
Police said the bomb, equivalent to between two and five kg of
explosives, went off under a table laden with food and drink for
the 130 mourners.
</P>
<P>
The explosion sent bodies flying across the graveyard and made
a crater four meters wide in the ground, Russian television
pictures showed.
</P>
<P>
The bomb was believed to be a settling of scores among
criminals associated with veterans groups, which benefit from
generous tax breaks.

COLOMBO, November 11 (Xinhua)-- Sri Lanka will launch a school

The plants, mostly of larger varieties, will be supplied by the
forest and agricultural departments.
</P>
<P>
Each student will be given two plants to plant and tender and
will have to look after them by watering them and ensure that they
grow into healthy trees, the release noted.
</P>
<P>
The tree planting campaign will be extended to other districts
when the monsoon rains come in those areas, the release added.

<HEADLINE> More Cases of HIV/AIDS Reported in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Health Ministry
recorded 14 more cases of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and
acquitted immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) at the end of October,
bringing the official total to 463, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures were announced Sunday by Health Ministry
director general for contagious disease eradication Hadi Abednego,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
HIV is a direct cause of AIDS. HIV attacks the body's immune
system, rendering it unable to combat infections. Sixty-six
Indonesians have died from AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Abednego believes that the actual number of people with
HIV/AIDS in Indonesia might be a hundred times the official
figure, with almost 90 percent of them contracting the disease
through intimate sexual (heterosexual or homosexual) contact.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates 25.5 million
adults and 2.4 million children worldwide are currently living
with HIV, 19 million in Sub-Saharan Africa, five million in South
and Southeast Asia and 1.6 million in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
"The global AIDS epidemic is now spreading faster in Asia than
anywhere else in the world. Soon, more Asians than Africans will
be getting infected each year," a WHO official said earlier.

<HEADLINE> No-Man Area Named in Philippines for Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine military
declared Sunday 12 villages in southern Basilan province as "no
man's land" as fierce fighting between the government forces and
the rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) raged there.
</P>
<P>
A local government source, who asked not to be identified, said
the 12 villages in Tipo-Tipo town have been totally deserted by
the residents, who also took their farm animals in evacuating to
safer grounds.
</P>
<P>
The source said air bombardments and massive shelling continued
in the area over the past several days.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said the military ordered the evacuation of the
civilians not only to get them out of harm's way, but also to
prevent them from helping the rebels, some of whom are their
relatives.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, hundreds of government reinforcements have arrived
in the region to help the troops who have fought the MILF rebels
for weeks.
</P>
<P>
Major General Rene Dado, commander of the Army's 1st Infantry
Division, said the entire Armed Forces in Basilan are preparing to
storm the MILF's last camp in Tipo-Tipo, Camp Parang. The MILF
lost the other three major camps in the region last week.
</P>
<P>
Dado said they have already taken a sketch of the
heavily-fortified rebel camp where remnants of the MILF force in
Tipo-Tipo and the newly arrived reinforcements from North Cotabato
and Zamboanga Del Sur were currently stationed.
</P>
<P>
As of Saturday, 31 government soldiers and 95 MILF guerrillas
have been slain since the fighting started between the two sides
on October 16, the military said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Buy Satellite Air Navigation System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines has planned to
buy a modern satellite-based air navigational system to replace
its limited-range land-based radar system for air traffic
controllers, the Air Transportation Office (ATO) said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Tanega, ATO chief, said the Philippines is among the
pilot areas in Asia where validating satellite stations will be
located to process data for the Global Positioning System (GPS)
and Global Navigational Satellite System (GNSS).
</P>
<P>
Tanega said the GPS and GNSS constitute a tracking scheme which
gives the precise locations of all flying aircraft around the
world.
</P>
<P>
Aircraft with the GPS continuously send out digital signals to
the satellite-based GNSS, which automatically computes their
locations, heading and altitude, which are relayed to validating
satellite stations around the world.
</P>
<P>
"All air traffic around the world will soon be controlled by
GPS and GNSS, allowing airlines to fly shorter routes to their
destinations and cutting operational costs. Under the new systems,
planes will also be allowed to fly closer to one another with less
fear of mid-air collision," Tanega said.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish government will install the stations in the country
and the system is expected to be operational in three to five
years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ATO will start using 130 million pesos (5.23
million US dollars) worth of assorted navigational aids, including
a new instrument landing system and multi-directional radar in
time for the arrival of leaders and officials for the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation meetings this month.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Current Account Surplus Falls a Third </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Japan's current account surplus
for the first half of the 1996 fiscal year dropped more than one
third from a year earlier as imports continued to grow strongly,
the Kyodo News Service reported today.
</P>
<P>
The surplus for the April-September period dropped by 35.3
percent to 3,332 billion yen (30 billion U.S. dollars) from 5,149
billion (46.4 billion dollars) a year before, according to a
Finance Ministry release.
</P>
<P>
The surplus was brought down by continued strong imports of
oil, computers and other products as well as an increase in
spending by Japanese traveling abroad, the Finance Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The current account balance measures the flow of goods and
services in and out of the country as well as investment income
and other monetary transfers.
</P>
<P>
The surplus was a six-year record low for half-year periods
since the 2,193 billion yen (19.8 billion dollars) in the second
half of fiscal 1990.
</P>
<P>
The first-half current account surplus also posted a decrease
for the sixth consecutive half-year period, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Japan's surplus in goods and services plunged 80 percent to
692.4 billion yen (6.2 billion dollars), representing a fall for
the sixth straight half-year period, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
In September alone, Japan's current account surplus fell 35.6
percent from a year earlier and the surplus in goods and services
trade fell a sharp 60 percent, the 22nd consecutive monthly
decline.
</P>
<P>
September exports edged ahead 0.3 percent to 3,766 billion yen
(34 billion dollars), an increase for the 14th straight month, but
imports jumped 15.4 percent to 2,792 billion yen (25.2 billion
dollars), up for the 26th month in a row.
</P>
<P>
Kyodo quoted an unnamed Finance Ministry official as predicting
that Japan's current account surplus will continue to show a
downward trend for the time being.
</P>
<P>
But he said the dollar's resurgence against the yen is unlikely
to have a large influence on the trend.
</P>
<P>
"The ministry's recent survey showed that few Japanese
companies plan to increase the ratio of domestic production and
lower overseas output amid the dollar's rebound against the yen,"
the official said.
</P>
<P>
The dollar slipped below 80 yen in April 1995, hitting its
postwar global low, but it recovered to 100 level late last year.
</P>
<P>
The dollar has recently been changing hands at levels over 110
yen. A weaker yen makes Japanese products more competitive on
overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
Shigeru Saito, economist at the Daiwa Institute of Research,
said Japan's current account surplus is expected to remain on a
downtrend, although the pace of decrease may slow.
</P>
<P>
"Even though the dollar's strength may slow down the pace of
import growth, Japan is expected to see its import increase
outpace its export growth for the time being," he said.

<HEADLINE> Cigarette Smuggling in Bangladesh Causes Huge Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to officials in the National Board of Revenue (NBR),
the loss figure is based on an estimate that revealed a total of
460 million sticks of the popular Benson and Hedges cigarettes
were smuggled into the country during the period.
</P>
<P>
Of the total amount, 58 million sticks entered the local market
in September and 65 million sticks in October, the officials said,
adding that "this is open secret now. Most people know about the
powerful trio engaged in this illegal trade."
</P>
<P>
No detail about the powerful trio was disclosed, but the
officials complained that the brands of cigarettes had been
entering into Bangladesh mainly through Chittagong, the largest
port city in the country's southeastern part, despite navy patrol
in the Bay of Bengal.
</P>
<P>
The officials suggested that there had been two ways to stop
the trade -- an anti-smuggling drive at the entry point and
frequent raid in the retail shops, but the drive should be
strengthened.

<HEADLINE> Progress Reported In North China Poverty Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, November 11 (Xinhua) -- During a 10-day inspection tour
of Shanxi Province, a World Bank official expressed confidence in
a poverty reduction project there in 20 of the poorest counties in
Yuncheng and Luliang prefectures.
</P>
<P>
The project involves 100 million U.S. dollars in World Bank
loans to improve the lives of three million rural residents in
north China's Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The seven-year project has 10 sub-projects: increasing
agricultural output and doubling annual incomes of 750,000 farmers
by improving terraced fields and irrigation; improving rural roads
so that 350,000 people in remote areas won't have to worry about
transportation any more; providing safe water for nearly 700,000
people; and helping women by offering them small business loans.
</P>
<P>
Juergen Voegele, a project official with the World Bank,
visited four counties in the province. He praised the
organization, saying that local people have shown a great interest
in the project, and that the speed of the renovation could be
considered a model for World Bank loan.
</P>
<P>
"Shanxi has been very cooperative in conducting the Shanxi
Poverty Alleviation Project with World Bank loans," said Voegele,
noting that the sub-projects will help change the conditions of
local people, and that it inspires World Bank's confidence in the
work.
</P>
<P>
"The project is being conducted smoothly," Voegele said,
commenting on wild jujubes, which are common to the area, bearing
fruit the same year they were grafted.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Governor of the New Zealand
Reserve Bank Don Brash today urged politicians negotiating a
coalition to consider the plight of exporters when proposing any
rise in spending.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Southland Federated Farmers, he said the NZ dollar
is staying high because people expect the next government to spend
more.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the high dollar has hurt the incomes of exporters,
he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He warned that further tax cuts planned by the National Party
government may need to be put off if the government's spending
increases.
</P>
<P>
The three parties of Labor, Alliance and New Zealand First all
promise to put more money in social areas like health and
education.
</P>
<P>
Increased spending will lead to higher inflation, forcing the
Reserve Bank to raise interest rates, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Power Price Agreement to Be Signed by Kenya, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 11 (Xinhua) -- A three-year agreement on
power price was reached in principle last week by Kenya and
Uganda for the formal endorsement of both sides, The East African
weekly reported today
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the paper said, from October 1996 to
October 1997, Uganda will supply a minimum 10 megawatts of power
between 5 am and 6 pm at 6.50 U.S. cents per unit, and as much
power as Kenya requires at night at 6 U.S. cents per unit.
</P>
<P>
Over the following two years to October 1999, the unit cost
increases to a maximum of eight U.S. cents, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a spokesman for the Uganda Electricity Board
as saying that a team from the Kenya Power and Lighting Company
was expected in Kampala soon for a follow-up meeting and possibly
the signing of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Under the old agreement signed during the colonial days in
1954, the two neighbouring east African countries have been
confined to a price of two U.S. cents per unit of electricity.
</P>

The Kenya-Uganda negotiation on power prices began when
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni hinted on October 4 that power
supplies to Kenya might be endangered unless both sides agreed to
a realistic new price.
</P>
<P>
The old agreement stipulated that Uganda should supply Kenya
with 30 megawatts of power subject to revision of the colonial
pact by the year 2004.

<HEADLINE> Two Israeli Soldiers Wounded in Lebanese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Two Israeli soldiers were
wounded in attacks by Shiite guerrillas of the Lebanese
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or party of God, in south Lebanon early
today.
</P>
<P>
The attacks took place less than 24 hours after Hezbollah
militants attacked the same Israeli position, destroying an
Israeli Merkava tank, killing one Israeli soldier and wounding
three others, said security sources in the Israeli
self-proclaimed "security zone" in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Guerrillas launched two successive attacks at the Israeli
position of Blat in the buffer zone at 8:40 a.m. (06:40 GMT) and
9:45 a.m. (07:45 GMT), in which they used anti-tank rockets and
machineguns, the security sources said.
</P>
<P>
They added that the Israeli forces at Blat and Hezbollah
guerrillas also exchanged artillery fires, and the guerrillas
fired more than 20 mortar shells at the vicinities of Blat and
Jcbal Al-Basi.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli forces, on the other hand, fired 155mm and 120mm
mortar shells at suspected guerrilla targets on hills and heights
opposite the Israeli-occupied border strip, and some 90 shells
hit the areas in a couple of hours, the sources noted.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Islamic Resistance, the military wing of
Hezbollah, announced that its fighters launched an attack at an
Israeli force near Blat this morning when it was advancing out of
the position by tanks and armored vehicles.
</P>
<P>
A violent clash erupted between the guerrillas and the Israeli
force, which "led to the destruction of two Israeli Merkava
tanks, and the killing and wounding of several Israeli soldiers,"
the statement added. But the security sources could not confirm
the claim.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have shrouded south Lebanon since the Saturday attack
at Blat in which one Israeli soldier was killed, three others
wounded, adding to 24 the Israeli soldiers killed in south
Lebanon since this year.
</P>
<P>
In retaliatory bombardment by Israeli forces at south Lebanese
villages following the attack, at least one civilian was wounded.
</P>
<P>
A militiaman of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army (SLA),
which patrols the 1,100-square-kilometer buffer zone, was also
killed in another attack by Hezbollah guerrillas at the SLA
position of Alman Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Paris-based Orient Radio quoted Israeli security sources
in Jerusalem as saying that the Jewish state has put its troops
in south Lebanon on a high alert.
</P>
<P>
They said that no weeks had passed without a rocket being
launched by Hezbollah guerrillas at Israeli tanks.
</P>
<P>
But the Israeli army was puzzled this time by the destruction
of the Merkava tank Saturday for this kind of tank is equipped
with rocketproof devices, which used to be effective in
protecting the tanks from the guerrillas' anti-tank weapons.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army described the incident as a "dangerous
development," according to the Israeli sources.
</P>
<P>
Hit-and-run attacks by guerrillas and bombardments by Israeli
forces constitute a daily scene on the last battle front of the
Arab-Israeli conflict, where Hezbollah plays a major role in the
guerrilla warfare against the Israeli occupation.

<HEADLINE> Diplomats in Zimbabwe Concerned About Muggings of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Some diplomatic missions in
Zimbabwe have expressed concern over the rising incidences of
mugging of tourists, which lately have become more violent.
</P>
<P>
According to Zimbabwe National News Agency today, the missions
said they had warned potential tourists in their home countries
about the imminent danger of being mugged while visiting
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Tourist muggings could retard growth of the tourism industry
which is rising to be among the country's top foreign currency
earners.
</P>
<P>
Last year over one million tourists arrived in Zimbabwe and
the industry is expected to grow so rapidly that by 1998 it could
earn 400 million U. S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
"In terms of bag snatching, we get about three to four reports
a week, but our concern is that the attacks are becoming more
violent with knives or other weapons sometimes being used," a
spokesman for the Australian High Commission said.
</P>
<P>
He said some of the incidents went unreported as tour groups
sometimes helped the victims make alternative travel
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
"Most of those who come to the embassy would be needing
assistance with air tickets or passports," he said.
</P>
<P>
The British travel and tour agencies had been notified about
the lurking danger of tourists being mugged, said British High
Commissioner Martin Williams.

<HEADLINE> Algeria to Conquer 15 Percent of European Gas Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Algeria opened a second gas
pipeline across the Mediterranean on Saturday, aiming to conquer
15 percent of the gas market in Europe, the Agence France Presse
(AFP) reported.
</P>
<P>
The energy minister of Algeria, Amar Makhloufi Guerraoui,
pushed the button of the Maghreb-Europe Gas Pipeline (GME) at
Hassi R'Mei in the Saharan desert in the presence of his
counterparts from Morocco, Spain, and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
The GME, which cost 2.3 billion U.S. dollars, will supply gas
to Spain and Portugal first, and will be extended to France and
Germany later.
</P>
<P>
AFP quoted Portuguese Minister of Energy Jose Benedos as saying
that GME "is a good example of cooperation between the two sides
of the Mediterranean and of Euro-Mediterranean partnership."
</P>
<P>
The GME, which starts from Hassi R'Mei, the largest gas field
of Algeria, is invested by the Export-Import Bank of the United
States and the European Bank of Investment, and is jointly built
by the U.S. company Bechtel and the Italian company SAIPEM.
</P>
<P>
The present gas producing capacity of GME is about 10 billion
cubic meters, and will be extended by 20 billion cubic meters by
the year 2,000 with the construction of five compression stations.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian national hydrocarbon company, the Sonatrach,
estimates that the GME will double from the year 2,000 its annual
export to 60 billion cubic meters, earning 1 billion dollars a
year.
</P>
<P>
Algeria's first gas pipeline, Transmed, which began to provide
gas to Italy through Tunisia in 1980, has attained a production
capacity of 20 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Algeria, with a hydrocarbon reserve of some 4.2 billion tons
equivalent to petroleum, is providing one quarter of gas
consumption in Southern Europe.

the two countries and hence great potential for developing their
economic and trade ties.
</P>
<P>
China, standing for trade based on equality and mutual benefit
among all countries in the world, has taken many measures to
attract foreign investments and facilitate the entry of foreign
commodities, said Li, who arrived in Brazil last Thursday.

Li described his talks with Brazilian President Fernando
Cardoso as fruitful, saying they exchanged views on a broad range
of issues.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier: Socialism Full of Vitality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAO PAULO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- China is conducting steady
political reform while introducing the socialist market economy
with a view to building China into a society with socialist
democracy and legal system that conform to China's conditions, said
Chinese Premier Li Peng here today.
</P>
<P>
Li was speaking in an interview with major Brazilian media
organizations during his official visit to the country.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions on whether China still follows the
socialist road when its economy has opened to the rest of the
world, Li Peng said China has chosen its own way of development in
line with its conditions and the course of history will prove that
China's road of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is
full of vitality.
</P>
<P>
Since China pursued the reform and opening policies 18 years
ago, Li said, its economy has been developing steadily, the
national strength has kept growing and the people's livelihood has
continued to improve. The world people, either those friendly to
China or those with biases toward China, maintain that the trend
of China's economic development is irresistible, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li spoke on how China has combined its communist model with the
market economy, how China has been controlling inflation while
maintaining the economic growth momentum, and on how China has
striven to narrow the gap between the rich and the poor.
</P>
<P>
"Without any doubts, China's long-term objective is to realize
communism, but she is at the present stage building socialism with
Chinese characteristics," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The market economy is something unique to capitalism, he said.
</P>
<P>
While devoting to building the socialist market economy, China
encourages some region or some people to become rich before the
objective of common prosperity is achieved, Li Peng said.
</P>
<P>
Li said the Chinese government has adopted a series of measures
to support the economic development in the underdeveloped regions.
</P>
<P>
One of the measures, he said, is to develop natural resources
and improve transportation and tele-communications conditions in
the regions, in addition to raising the purchasing price of
primary products, mainly agricultural produce, petroleum and coal,
and encouraging foreigners to invest in the regions. Other
measures include the levying of income tax, like that of all other
countries in the world, he added.
</P>
<P>
China is at present tackling the task of correctly handling
relations between reform, development and stability, Li said.
</P>
<P>
"Development is our objective, reform is the driving force of
development, and stability is the prerequisite of reform and
development. And in turn, it is necessary to consolidate social
stability through reform and development," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng stressed that too quick economic growth or too big
reform steps might bring about certain imbalance, thus negatively
affecting social stability. It is necessary to conduct
macro-readjustment to help balance the relations, he said.

<HEADLINE> Clashes Continue in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Clashes between Lebanese
Hezbollah (Party of God) gunmen and Israeli troops continued in
south Lebanon today, when three Israeli soldiers were wounded.
</P>
<P>
According to an Israeli Radio report, the soldiers were
injured in a Hezbollah attack on an Israeli army position in the
western sector of the Israeli self-declared "security zone" in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah fired mortars and missiles at the outpost in
Karkum, in Jabal Balat region, the same position which was under
Hezbollah attack Saturday, when one Israeli soldier was killed,
and three others wounded.
</P>
<P>
During today's incident, all together very similar to
Saturday's clashes, Hezbollah anti-tank missile again directly
struck an Israeli tank at the same Israeli army outpost.
</P>
<P>
All three wounded Israeli soldiers were evacuated to the
Rambam Hospital in Haifa, in north Israel, where doctors said
one of the them was seriously hurt and has been undergoing
operation, while the two others were lightly injured.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile in Lebanon, Beirut Radio also reported exchange of
fire between Hezbollah and Israeli troops in the western sector
of the "security zone."
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a statement issue by Hezbollah as saying
that Hezbollah forces again fire missiles today on the same
Israeli army outpost they attacked Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In response, according to an Israel Television report,
Israeli artillery pounded Hezbollah positions in the region, and
Israeli Air Force jets also participated in the action.
</P>
<P>
The injuries today brought to 88 the number of Israeli
soldiers wounded in south Lebanon since the beginning of this
year, while 24 have been killed, said the report.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, there have been more than 300 attacks
on Israeli army and its surrogate South Lebanon Army (SLA)
targets in the "security zone" and the SLA-controlled Jezzine
enclave north of the zone.
</P>
<P>
Hit-and-run attacks by Hezbollah guerrillas and shellings by
Israeli occupation forces at south Lebanese villages constitute a
daily scene on the last active battlefront of the Arab-Israeli
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the "security zone" in south Lebanon in
1985 as a buffer to shield its northern Jewish settlements from
cross-board guerrilla attacks.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The EU troika delegation led
by Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring left here this afternoon
after a two-day visit to Syria.
</P>
<P>
At a joint news conference held by the Irish foreign minister
and his Syrian counterpart Farouq al-Shara at the airport, Shara
said the talks with the troika delegation demonstrated agreement
and identity in views regarding the necessity of resumption of
the peace process from the point it had already reached.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed that commitments undertaken by the
previous Israeli government had to be respected and negotiations
be resumed on the basis of international legitimacy resolutions
and the land-for-peace formula, Shara said.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian foreign minister praised the stance of the EU in
pushing the peace process forward, describing it as "identical or
very close" to the Arab stance.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring said that the
delegation exchanged views with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
on the present status of the Middle East peace process,
particularly the prospects of the process on the Syrian-Israeli
track.
</P>
<P>
Spring disclosed that Assad had assured the delegation of
Syria's commitment to the peace process, pointing out that the
Israelis ought to respect the agreements already signed in order
to make progress in the process.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that the Syrian president welcomed an EU role in
the regional peace process as well as the dispatch of a special
EU envoy to the region so that the European role might join hands
with that of the two co-sponsors of the peace process, namely,
the U.S. and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The three-man troika delegation comprising the representatives
of Ireland, Holland and Italy arrived in Damascus Saturday on an
official visit to Syria.

<HEADLINE> Israel Launches Air Strike at Lebanese Guerrilla </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli forces launched this
afternoon an air raid at Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah (Party of
God) guerrilla bases in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The move was in retaliation for the killing of one Israeli
soldier and the wounding of five others by guerrilla attacks
since Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in south Lebanon reported that Israeli jet
fighters carried out the air raid at the guerrilla bases at 4:50
p.m. (14:50 GMT).
</P>
<P>
They said that one Israeli warplane fired two air-to-surface
missiles at targets on the east side of Ein Buswar village at
Iglim Al-Toffah in the Province of Apple, about 65 kilometers
southeast of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Another Israeli warplane flew over the area in the meantime,
providing a cover for the plane executing the attack, the
security sources said.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah guerrillas fired upward with a SAM-7 surface-to-air
missile and other anti-air weapons without hitting the target.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Army forces around the area also opened fire at the
invaders, the security sources added.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes flew reconnaissance missions since 3:30
p.m. (13:30 GMT) over the area of Nabatiyeh and Iglim Al-Toffah,
a mountain area often used by Moslem guerrillas as a springboard
to attack the Israeli occupation forces in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Today's air raid came when the situation in south Lebanon is
deteriorating following a series of exchanging fires between
Israeli forces and Hezbollah guerrillas since Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in the Israeli self-proclaimed "security
zone" in south Lebanon reported that two Israeli soldiers were
wounded, including one seriously, in attacks by Hezbollah
guerrillas earlier today at the Israeli position of Blat in the
occupied border strip.
</P>
<P>
Guerrillas launched two successive attacks at Blat at 8:40
a.m. (06:40 GMT) and 9:45 a.m. (07:45 GMT), in which they used
anti-tank rockets and machine guns, wounding two Israeli
soldiers, the security sources said.
</P>
<P>
Two militiamen of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army were
also injured in the fightings, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military wing of Hezbollah, has
claimed responsibility for the operations.
</P>
<P>
Following the attack, Israeli artillery shelled suspected
guerrilla targets on the hills and heights opposite the buffer
zone, no casualties were reported by security sources.
</P>
<P>
At least one civilian was wounded when Israeli forces
bombarded south Lebanese villages Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hit-and-run attacks by guerrillas and bombardments by Israeli
forces in south Lebanon constitute a daily scene on the last
battle front of the Arab-Israeli conflict, where Hezbollah plays
a major role in the guerrilla warfare against the Israeli
occupation.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the 1,100-square-kilometer "security zone"
in south Lebanon in 1985 as a buffer to guard against cross-board
guerrilla attacks on its northern Jewish settlements.

<P>
TEHRAN, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The International Conference on
Indian Ocean Community opened here today with the participation of
government officials and specialists from 30 Indian Ocean littoral
states and Central Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the conference, Iranian President Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani called on regional countries to join hands
to preserve security and boost cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The president warned that the detrimental and destructive
impacts of disputed regions and centers of danger on the
international security and peace are extensive.
</P>
<P>
Thus, he urged the regional countries to take positive move
to prevent emergence of any crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Ocean region covers 53 coastal nations with
diverse spectrum of culture and a population of 1.5 billion
equivalent to one fourth of the world's total population.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference is seeking to work out ways of
solving regional problems and also assess the present situation
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Countries represented at the conference include Australia,
Indian, Indonesia, Iran, Kenya, Omen, Zimbabwe, Georgia,

Velayati said the Indian Ocean region is suitable for setting up a
regional grouping.
</P>
<P>
He said the Indian Ocean is the world's third largest ocean in
terms of area and one of the richest in terms of minerals.
</P>
<P>
The oil and natural gas reserves of the Indian Ocean region
accounts for 35 percent of the entire oil and gas reserves of the
world, Velayati noted.
</P>
<P>
He said if the oil and natural gas resources of the Caspian
Sea and Central Asian region are taken into account, the
strategical importance of cooperation among the Indian Ocean
littoral states will become clearer.

<HEADLINE> China's Entry Into WTO Benefits World: Li Peng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAO PAULO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said
today that China will continue to strengthen its economic
cooperation and trade with the rest of the world and China's entry
into the World Trade Organization (WTO) will benefit the whole
world.
</P>
<P>
Li, now making an official visit in Brazil, made the remarks in
an interview with major Brazilian media organizations on the
question of China's entry into the WTO and of regional economic
development.
</P>
<P>
China has made great efforts in this regard, Li stated, citing
the huge reduction of tariffs from 35.9 percent to 23 percent as
of last April. The fact is known to the world, Li Peng said.
However, he said, China is still excluded in the organization, and
"this is is not just."
</P>
<P>
The exclusion of China in the WTO will incur losses to China
and will also bring more disadvantages to all the trade partners,
Li said.
</P>
<P>
On regional economic development, Li Peng said the integration
of Latin America has been advancing rapidly and this is the
specific demonstration of Latin America's efforts to maintain
world peace and promote economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"We are not in favor of trade protectionism as the world
development needs increasing exchanges. However, efforts to
establish a common market for common interests are entirely a
different thing," he said.
</P>
<P>
Though China and Brazil are separated afar, they should
strengthen contacts and exchanges and the prospect for their
cooperation and common development is bright, Li Peng noted.

SAO PAULO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng

with Brazilian President Fernando Cardoso in Brasilia Friday, he

The accelerated development of the world toward
multipolarization benefits world peace, security and stability,
said the Chinese premier.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier, who is now in Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest
city, to continue his visit to Brazil, arrived in the country on
November 7. Brazil is the second leg of his Latin America tour

<HEADLINE> Yemeni, Saudi Ministers Discuss Border Disputes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni Deputy Prime
Minister Abdel Karim Al-Aryan and his Saudi Arabian counterpart
Prince Sultan Bin Abdel Aziz today held talks on latest
developments in solving the border disputes between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait News Agency reported from Saudi capital Riyadh that
their talks held there were conducted when the two countries are
making joint efforts to reach a comprehensive and satisfactory
settlement to their border dispute.
</P>
<P>
Al-Aryani, who is also the Yemeni foreign minister, arrived at
Riyadh Saturday and discussed with Saudi Interior Minister Prince
Naif Bin Abdel Aziz on how to end the border dispute.
</P>
<P>
His Saudi tour was the second in 10 days, in an apparent step
to quicken the process of normalization of bilateral relations
through solving the prolonged border disputes.
</P>
<P>
The disputes date back to the 1960s when Britain ended its
domination of the Gulf, leaving ill-defined frontiers separating
the countries.
</P>
<P>
Serious efforts to settle the issue were made by both the
countries in the past two years and progress was attained since
they signed a Memorandum of Understanding in February 1995 aimed
at eradicating tense situation along the border areas and
promoting realization of normal bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Recent months have seen a flurry of exchanges of official
visits and contacts between the two countries, resulting in a
number of agreements on cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Yemeni Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Ahmad Mohammad Al-Kabab was
quoted by KUNA as saying that the exchange of visits was
constructive for the promotion of relations.
</P>
<P>
He said all the meetings and contacts would help facilitate
the work of the joint border committee assigned with the task of
working out details for boundary demarcation according to the Memo.
</P>
<P>
He denied the presence of any disputes obstructing the work
of the committee, which last met in Sanna, Yemen, in August.

<HEADLINE> Humanitarian Groups Ready to Enter Zaire to Rescue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- International humanitarian
groups are ready to enter Zaire to rescue some 1.2 million
refugees faced with death, but they have yet to get the support of
the international community and the green light of the Tutsi
rebels who control the Rwandan-Zairean border.
</P>
<P>
The French humanitarian group Medecins sans Frontiere (MSF)
today became the first to be allowed by the Banyamulenge Tutsi
rebels to enter Zaire from Bukavu, South Kivu, to send two
truck loads of food and medical materials to the refugees, the
Agence France Presse (AFP) quoted MSF officials as saying in
Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, witnesses from the refugees in eastern Zaire said
that it might be already too late for the international community
to intervene as the refugees are dying in thousands of hunger,
thirst, weakness and epidemic diseases such as diarrhoea, cholera
and chronic vomiting.
</P>
<P>
The Tutsi rebels accused the Zairean government forces and Hutu
extremists of holding hundreds of thousands of refugees as
hostages and human shields, while preparing to take back the Kivu
region from the Tutsis, according to AFP reports.
</P>
<P>
AFP quoted the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) as saying in Nairobi that many Hutu refugees who have
returned to Rwanda have wounds from gunshots on their backs.
</P>
<P>
The refugees accused the former Rwandan Hutu Interahawe
militias of shooting at them to stop them from returning to
Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The Interahawe militias, held responsible for the 1994 genocide

human exodus of some 1.2 million refugees from refugee camps in

ANKARA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Deputy Prime Minister
and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller is expected to pay a two-day
working visit to Jordan Monday to discuss recent developments in
the Middle East with one of Turkey's closest neighbors.

Industry and Trade Minister Yalim Erez, and Energy Minister
Recai Kutan.

<HEADLINE> Report Calls for Evacuation of Jews From Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 10 (Xinhua) -- A confidential security
report calls on the Israeli government to pull out the 400 Jewish
settlers from the West Bank city of Hebron, an Israeli Television
report said tonight.
</P>
<P>
The report, called Operation Transfer of the Peace, says that
it is impossible to find a viable solution to Hebron, where about
400 Jews live among some 120,000 Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Reportedly compiled by senior officers of the Israel Defense
Forces (IDF), General Security Service and Police, the report
recommends evacuating the settlers, adding that, otherwise, it
will not be a question of whether, but when, clashes will erupt
between Jews and Palestinians in the city.
</P>
<P>
The report claims that two settler women may try to burn
themselves alive. In addition, it says there is also the
possibility that armed settlers will enter the Palestinian part
of Hebron sparking a major clash.
</P>
<P>
Government sources have denied the report findings. The Prime
Minister's Office today totally rejected any idea of evacuating
Jewish settlement from Hebron, saying that on the contrary, the
government is committed to preserving their wellbeing.
</P>
<P>
President Ezer Weizman today urged the government to carry
out redeployment from Hebron as soon as possible. He also
appealed to Jews, both right and left, not to raise their hands
against each other.
</P>
<P>
Security forces have recently arrested an activist of a Jewish
terrorist organization, and more rightwing extremists are
expected to be held under administrative detention ahead of
Israeli troop withdrawal.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier on Sino-Brazilian Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAO PAULO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng has
said that China and Brazil share identical or similar views on
many international issues and their partnership based on common
goals, equality and mutual benefit will serve the interests of the
people of both countries.
</P>
<P>
Brazil, as the largest developing country in Latin America and
a member of the South American Common Market, could play an
important role in promoting economic and trade cooperation between
China and Latin America, Li said in an interview with four
Brazilian news organizations during his current visit to Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Li said that economic and trade relations between the two
countries have developed remarkedly with the bilateral trade
volume nearly hitting 2 billion U.S. dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
He said there exists strong economic complementality between
the two countries and hence great potential for developing their
economic and trade ties.
</P>
<P>
China, standing for trade based on equality and mutual benefit
among all countries in the world, has taken many measures to
attract foreign investments and facilitate the entry of foreign
commodities, said Li, who arrived in Brazil last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Li described his talks with Brazilian President Fernando
Cardoso as fruitful, saying they exchanged views on a broad range
of issues.
</P>
<P>
He said a number of documents of cooperation were signed and
the two nations' entrepreneurs also reached agreement on
strengthening exchanges and cooperation in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
Brazil is the second leg of the Chinese premier's Latin America
tour which will also take him to Venezuela. He visited Chile on
November 6-7.

<HEADLINE> (Rpt With Correction) Chinese Premier: Socialism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAO PAULO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- China is conducting steady
political reform while introducing the socialist market economy
with a view to building China into a society with socialist
democracy and legal system that conform to China's conditions,
Chinese Premier Li Peng has said.
</P>
<P>
Li was speaking in an interview with major Brazilian media
organizations during his official visit to the country.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions on whether China still follows the
socialist road when its economy has opened to the rest of the
world, Li Peng said China has chosen its own way of development in
line with its conditions and the course of history will prove that
China's road of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is
full of vitality.
</P>
<P>
Since China pursued the reform and opening policies 18 years
ago, Li said, its economy has been developing steadily, the
national strength has kept growing and the people's livelihood has
continued to improve. The world people, either those friendly to
China or those with biases toward China, maintain that the trend
of China's economic development is irresistible, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li spoke on how China has combined its communist model with the
market economy, how China has been controlling inflation while
maintaining the economic growth momentum, and on how China has
striven to narrow the gap between the rich and the poor.
</P>
<P>
"Without any doubts, China's long-term objective is to realize
communism, but she is at the present stage building socialism with
Chinese characteristics," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The market economy is something unique to capitalism, he said.
</P>
<P>
While devoting to building the socialist market economy, China
encourages some region or some people to become rich before the
objective of common prosperity is achieved, Li Peng said.
</P>
<P>
Li said the Chinese government has adopted a series of measures
to support the economic development in the underdeveloped regions.
</P>
<P>
One of the measures, he said, is to develop natural resources
and improve transportation and tele-communications conditions in
the regions, in addition to raising the purchasing price of
primary products, mainly agricultural produce, petroleum and coal,
and encouraging foreigners to invest in the regions. Other
measures include the levying of income tax, like that of all other
countries in the world, he added.
</P>
<P>
China is at present tackling the task of correctly handling
relations between reform, development and stability, Li said.
</P>
<P>
"Development is our objective, reform is the driving force of
development, and stability is the prerequisite of reform and
development. And in turn, it is necessary to consolidate social
stability through reform and development," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng stressed that too quick economic growth or too big
reform steps might bring about certain imbalance, thus negatively
affecting social stability. It is necessary to conduct
macro-readjustment to help balance the relations, he said.

<HEADLINE> (Rpt With Correction) China's Entry Into WTO Benefits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAO PAULO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng has
said China will continue to strengthen its economic cooperation
and trade with the rest of the world and China's entry into the
World Trade Organization (WTO) will benefit the whole world.
</P>
<P>
Li, now making an official visit in Brazil, made the remarks in
an interview with major Brazilian media organizations on the
question of China's entry into the WTO and of regional economic
development.
</P>
<P>
China has made great efforts in this regard, Li stated, citing
the huge reduction of tariffs from 35.9 percent to 23 percent as
of last April. The fact is known to the world, Li Peng said.
However, he said, China is still excluded in the organization, and
"this is is not just."
</P>
<P>
The exclusion of China in the WTO will incur losses to China
and will also bring more disadvantages to all the trade partners,
Li said.
</P>
<P>
On regional economic development, Li Peng said the integration
of Latin America has been advancing rapidly and this is the
specific demonstration of Latin America's efforts to maintain
world peace and promote economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"We are not in favor of trade protectionism as the world
development needs increasing exchanges. However, efforts to
establish a common market for common interests are entirely a
different thing," he said.
</P>
<P>
Though China and Brazil are separated afar, they should
strengthen contacts and exchanges and the prospect for their
cooperation and common development is bright, Li Peng noted.

SAO PAULO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng has
stressed that a world dominated by only one country would be
harmful to all developing countries and to other countries as
well.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with four Brazilian news organizations during

with Brazilian President Fernando Cardoso in Brasilia Friday, he
and Cardoso shared the view that the world now is developing in
the direction of multipolarization.
</P>
<P>
The accelerated development of the world toward
multipolarization benefits world peace, security and stability,
said the Chinese premier.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier, who is now in Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest

<HEADLINE> Turkey Calls on EU To Honor Commitments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has expressed its
displeasure with the European Union (EU) for its failure to honor
its commitments towards Ankara made in a bilateral customs union
accord which came into force at the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller lodged
the complaint to Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring, whose country
holds the EU's rotating term presidency, at a meeting in Istanbul
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement after her two-and-a-half hour meeting,
Ciller said that the EU is not honoring its commitments towards
Turkey despite the conclusion of the custom union.
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament recently voted to halt transition of
credits earmarked for Ankara under the custom union accord citing
human rights conditions in Turkey and alleged aggression by
Turkey in Cyprus, the Aegean and northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
These credits had already been blocked due to a Greek veto. So
the European Parliament's decision to drop the credits only served
to sharpen the Turkish-EU relations.
</P>
<P>
Anatolia News Agency quoted Ciller as describing the blocking
of these credits to Turkey as a "great injustice."
</P>
<P>
Ciller's meeting with Spring was designed to prepare the
groundwork for the upcoming meeting of the Turkish-EU Association
Council which is due to be held in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Displaying Turkey's eagerness to join the EU to Spring, Ciller
also said that Turkey's bid for EU membership should not be pushed
behind those of central and eastern European countries in view of
the Ankara's traditional links with the union.

<HEADLINE> Athens Stock Exchange to Resume Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Greek National Economy Ministry
Secretary General Apostolos Fotiadis announced today that the
Athens Stock Exchange (ASE), which suspended trading Friday, would
be open for business as usual Monday.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after a clean-up operation was decided by
the government at the ASE following a series of meetings between
the Union of Stock Exchange Members and the National Economy
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The ASE suspended trading Friday for the first time in its
120-year-old history following the inability of the Delta S.A.
Brokerage firm to cover cash obligations to the depository of 2.6
billion drachmas (about 11.3 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to reports today, the titles depository has agreed to
guarantee transactions and will cover Delta's debt. Meanwhile, it
was also reported that the brokers have no objection to having
part of the debt covered by the Joint-Surety Fund on the condition
that transactions be covered by a legislative amendment
prohibiting cash being transferred to brokerage firms owing
titles.
</P>
<P>
Fotiadis stressed that in the future, any company that broke
the rules would be forced to discontinue transactions and would be
fined 50 million drachmas (about 210,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Athens' public prosecutor George Koliokostas filed charges of
criminal fraud against Delta's chairman, vice-president and a
board member Friday and prohibited them from leaving the country.

<HEADLINE> France Accuses British Shop of Cheating Customers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The French government today
accused the British shop, Crazy George's, of cheating customers
with posters giving deceptive prices and treatments.
</P>
<P>
French Minister of Economy and Finances Jean Arthuis today
ordered Crazy George's, which opened Saturday a shop in Bovigny,
northeast of Paris, "to wait a couple of days before receiving new
customers."
</P>
<P>
Crazy George's, which caters for customers of low incomes,
invites people to buy its furniture, electric appliances and
Hi-Fi's with treatment of paying the products in several years.
</P>
<P>
The posters put out by the shop have the price to be paid on a
weekly basis written in big characters, but hide the fact that the
price for commodities sold this way can double in a three-year
period.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France Presse (AFP) quoted good sources as saying
that the heads of Crazy George's have decided to close their shop
for one week.
</P>
<P>
"Crazy George's cannot resume its business as long as it does
not respect the law," said Arthuis, while denying that the
government had resorted to administrative measures to close the
shop.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the shop pulled down all the posters it had put
out tonight, it could open Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
"To certain degrees, the shop has jumped over the yellow line.
I urge all its leaflets to conform with the law," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) member states have rejected Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu's suggestion on the establishment of a
Palestinian self-rule entity in association with Israel,
according to reports reaching here today from Doha, Qatar.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hamad Bin Jaber al Thani, Qatari Minister of Foreign
Affairs, made the remarks today at a news conference held in Doha
upon the conclusion of the 61st session of the GCC foreign
ministers in preparation of the 17th GCC summit due to take place
in Doha in December.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari minister pointed out the necessity of Israel's
adherence to the agreements signed with the Palestinian side,
underlining the importance of resuming negotiations on the Syrian
and Lebanese tracks.
</P>
<P>
He underscored that the GCC will closely follow the situation,
and will take necessary measures in response to any attempt of
Israel to disavow its previous pledges, hoping that the Israeli
government will reconsider its stances toward the peace process
and adhere to the accords that have already been signed.
</P>
<P>
He added that during the third sitting of the GCC foreign
ministers in Doha today, within the context of the GCC
ministerial conference, discussions covered ways and means of
strengthening joint cooperation among GCC member states in the
political, economic, military, security and information fields.
</P>
<P>
The GCC ministers also discussed Arab and international issues
of common interest, as well as the works of the two previous
closed sittings which were held Saturday to draft an agenda for
the upcoming GCC summit, said the Qatari foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
The 61st session of the GCC foreign ministers began in Doha
Saturday.

<P>
PARIS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- France today asked the United
States to assume the command of a multinational force likely to be
deployed in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette said on Radio France
Internationale that the participation of the United States was
indispensable because it would make the operation a purely
humanitarian one without any suspected national interests involved.
</P>
<P>
France has been accused by Rwanda of having its own interests by
calling for the deployment of an international force in eastern
Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"It is so true that we have said from the beginning of the game
that we don't want the command of this operation. We don't want that
it (the command) would be French. We proposed that it should be
American," said de Charette.
</P>
<P>
The United States is highly reserved over a French proposal to
have a 5,000-man multinational force deployed in eastern Zaire to
rescue more than 1 million refugees faced with death.

PARIS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The Zairean Tutsi rebels today
said that the multinational intervention force to be deployed in
what they called "liberated zones" of Zaire must be "absolutely
impartial."
</P>
<P>
The Agence France Presse (AFP) quoted Laurent Kabila,
coordinator of the Alliance of Democratic Force for the Liberation
of Congo-Zaire (ADFLCZ), as saying that humanitarian groups should
first contact the ADFLCZ for authorization for entering Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Giving a press conference in a villa beside the Lake Kivu in
Goma, the Zairean Tutsi leader said that his soldiers could also
open another human corridor toward the refugee camp of Mugunga,
where 400,000 refugees are on the verge of death.
</P>
<P>
The Mugunga camp is reportedly controlled by Zairean troops and
Rwandan Hutu extremists, who were accused by the ADFLCZ of using
refugees as human shields in resisting the advance of Tutsi
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Some 700,000 other refugees are stacked in a small bay beside
the Lake Kivu, 27 kilometers from Goma.
</P>

<HEADLINE> American Tax Crackdown Mission Costs Greece 1.8 Mln Dlrs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- American experts from the U.S.'
Internal Revenue Service (IRS), who came here last August to help
the Greek government catch tax evaders, will cost Greece over 414
million drachmas (1.8 million U.S. dollars) to no avail -- for the
time being at least.
</P>
<P>
The infuential Greek weekly To Vima (tribune) said today that
the American experts have found their mission a tougher going than
they had expected and declared their efforts as pointless as a
result of the chaos and corruption surrounding the Greek state.
</P>
<P>
As time rolls on, the IRS officials are all the more convinced
that, as things currently stand, nothing can be done to clamp down
effectively on rampant tax evasion due to the country's outdated
tax system.
</P>
<P>
The paper alleged that Greece's Tax Department is not backed by
a computerized system which would allow for direct access to
details on taxpayers, while banks and insurance companies keep
financial details of their clients under wraps. Furthermore, local
tax officials are inadequately trained for the job.
</P>
<P>
As for the remuneration packaged for the IRS officials, the
paper said they will each receive 314,302 U.S. dollars for the
first year and 321,391 dollars for the second. Travel allowance
money has been set at 100,998 for year one and 114,854 for the
second, while contingency spending has been set at 9,400 and 8,000
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Greece's Finance Ministry has put together a coordinating
committee which controls two teams, each comprised of four local
tax officials, and set up specifically to collaborate with the IRS
tax experts.
</P>
<P>
Greece is well known for its tax evasion and according to the
latest report, the total back taxes owed by private citizens and
public utilities total 2.2 trillion drachmas (about 95.7 billion
U.S. dollars), about 10 percent of Greece's gross domestic
product.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Manufacturers on Government's 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Manufacturers in Nigeria today
suggested that the government should place the main thrust of its
budget for 1997 on growth stimulation, while addressing the
problem of low industrial capacity utilization and high level of
unsold inventories.
</P>
<P>
Domestic demand should be stimulated in the first half of 1997
to reverse the slow-down in economic growth and the dismal
performance of the manufacturing sector which now has a capacity
utilization of only 31 percent, according to the pre-budget
memorandum of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN).
</P>
<P>
The document stressed monetary and fiscal policies should be
sufficiently reflationary to stimulate growth and employment.
</P>
<P>
This suggestion echoes that of the National Association of
Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA).
</P>
<P>
In its memorandum to the federal government concerning the
composition of the 1997 budget, the NACCIMA suggested acclerated
economic recovery and growth stimulation through cautious
reflatory measures and controlled inflation.
</P>
<P>
The MAN documents, citing available data from the World Bank,
said gross savings and investments in Nigeria between 1995 and
1996 are projected at less than 15 percent of the gross domestic
product.
</P>
<P>
In order to increase savings and investments, particularly
foreign direct investment, the MAN said, efforts should be made
to reduce inflation substantially and avoid volatility in real
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign investor-friendly climate, efficient bureaucracy and
good returns on investment are necessary, not only to reverse the
recent trend of divestment of foreign investors, but also attract
and sustain fresh foreign direct investment," it said.
</P>
<P>
Both the MAN and the NACCIMA believe that their suggestions
can be achieved through consistent policies in an environment of
political stability, security of life and property and improved
social and economic infrastructure.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Maj.-Gen. Pero Colic, who
replaced Gen. Ratko Mladic as the new Serb army commander, said in
Pale today that the efforts to reorganize the Serb army and make
it professional would continue.
</P>
<P>
Priority would be given to personnel matters and the matter of
financing the army, Colic told reporters after he was sworn in as
the chief of staff of the Serb army.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was attended by Serb President Biljana Plavsic,
who signed the decree Saturday to dismiss Mladic "due to strong
international pressure." She also replaced more than 80 other
senior officers.
</P>
<P>
"The general staff is composed of competent and proven fighters
for Republika Srpska," the Tanjug news agency quoted Colic as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The Serb Supreme Defense Council Saturday appointed Gen. Colic
chief of staff, and Maj.-Gen. Dragan Josipovic the deputy
commander.
</P>
<P>
The army's supreme command, which was headed by Gen. Mladic,
was renamed the general staff under a parliament decision on
September 12.
</P>
<P>
Mladic led the Bosnian Serb army throughout the three and half
year civil war and was the most popular military leader in the
Serb republic. He was indicted in November 1995 by the Hague-based
U.N. War Crimes Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and was banned
from taking public office by the Dayton peace agreement.

<P>
The Eurotunnel shares have been among the most volatile of all
those quoted on the London and Paris stock markets, making them a
more likely target for inside trading.
</P>
<P>
The French police authorities have reportedly alleged that
sensitive commercial information about the financial restructuring
of Eurotunnel has been leaked to speculators.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman stressed that the information to be
gathered by the SFO would be for the French authorities only. "We
don't have grounds to investigate allegations of market
manipulations on a domestic level," he said.

<HEADLINE> US President Says Balanced Budget to Be Top Priority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
has pledged that the top priority of his new administration will
be to agree with Republicans on a balanced budget.
</P>
<P>
"That's plainly the message of the election," Clinton said in
an interview with ABC which was broadcasted today. He said he
thought that "psychologically and in fact economically it is very
important for America to have a balanced budget."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that if he could pass only one thing in the coming
year, it would be a balanced budget plan to open the door for more
Americans to attend college and continue efforts to broaden health
care coverage.
</P>
<P>
Under strong pressure from Republicans, President Clinton
signed on to the need for a balanced budget timetable last year.
But he vetoed twice the packages for balancing the budget put
forward by Republicans because of a big difference between the
government and Republican-controlled Congress on the plan.
</P>
<P>
The battle over the balancing the budget about a year ago, a
prelude of this year's presidential election, resulted in two
partial government shutdowns totaling 27 days.
</P>
<P>
However, President Clinton said in the interview that his
balanced-budget talks with Republicans came very close to success.
</P>
<P>
"We were very very close in dollar numbers, so I would think it
would be easily achievable," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is to meet with U.S. Congressional leaders this week to
discuss the agenda for the 105th Congress which will begin in
coming January.

<HEADLINE> No Turning Back On Europe In UK: CBI/BCC Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARROGATE, ENGLAND, November 10 (Xinhua) -- British business
remains firmly committed to the UK's membership of the European
Union (EU) and strongly supports keeping open the option of
joining the European Monetary Union (EMU), according to a major
new survey released here today.
</P>
<P>
The key results of the survey show: 87 percent of the firms
conducted think the UK's best interests are served by staying in
the EU. Only 8 percent favor withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-eight percent believe the single market has improved
business opportunities within the EU, with 13 percent disagreeing.
Fifty-one percent believe it has brought real benefit to their
individual company, against 25 percent who have not directly
benefited.
</P>
<P>
However, 32 percent still feel that it has failed to remove
previous barriers to trade in the EU, while 40 percent believe it
has.
</P>
<P>
Thirty percent of those questioned say the UK's membership of
the EU has made it more likely for them to invest in the UK, while
only 3 percent think it less likely.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-six percent of firms support the principle of the UK
participating in the EMU, while 30 percent are opposed.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the survey, David Richardson, president of the
British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said, "This survey indicates
yet again that business has no doubts whether we should be in or
out of Europe."
</P>
<P>
"It believes that we are in, we are right to be in and we
should stay in. There is a strong view that it is our politicians
that are letting us down."
</P>
<P>
"The message from business is clear: stop playing games with
our future in Europe. What business needs is a government which is
clearly committed to Europe, influential in the key decisions in
Europe and able to give business the certainty with which to plan
for the future," he added.
</P>
<P>
Colin Marshall, CBI president, also said this afternoon at a
press conference, "Firms remain very positive about membership of
the European Union, for practical not starry-eyed reasons...to
reject it now would give us no say as to how the Euro-coin
eventually falls."
</P>
<P>
The survey shows there is continued concern over the level of
the debate on Europe in the UK. Fifty-eight percent of firms think
that the political debate has harmed the government's ability to
influence EU policy.
</P>
<P>
On the EMU, 61 percent of firms think they do not have enough
information to plan effectively should the UK join a single
currency. And 57 percent think they are ill-informed as to how to
plan if the UK stays out.
</P>
<P>
Concerns remain about continued unfair competition, although
this figure is down on last year. Forty-nine percent said they
continued to experience unfair competition in the single market:
of these 32 percent blame uneven enforcement of EU legislation in
other member states, and 30 percent complain of over-zealous
implementation by UK authorities.
</P>
<P>
There is strong support in the survey for Britain's opt-out
from the Social Chapter. Seventy-three percent agree it should be
retained with 20 percent disagreeing.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted independently by MORI on a random
sample basis on behalf of the CBI and BCC.

LONDON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Ireland dropped their first

MOSCOW, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Croatian Goran Ivanisevic
claimed the title by beating Russian favourite Yevgeny Kafelnikov

</P>
<P>
Ivanisevic, sporting a newly grown pony-tail, handed

<HEADLINE> Half of Beijing Middle School Students Want to Be Scientists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Results of a latest survey
show that one out of every two middle school students in Beijing
wants to be a scientist in the future.
</P>
<P>
According to China Youth Daily, 50.7 percent of all students
polled would choose to be scientist when they grow up. Another
32.8 percent have yet to decide their ambitions.
</P>
<P>
Among those who want to be scientists, 16.5 percent would like
to be medical scientists, a higher ratio compared to would-be
computer scientists, physicists, biologists, geologists and
environment scientists.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted in 12 middle schools in
Beijing. Students sampled are from both junior and senior middle
schools. But the newspaper did not say how many students received
the survey.
</P>
<P>
About two thirds of those who take "being a scientist" as their
ideal explained that to be a scientist accords with their own
interests and hobbies. That scientists are great contributors to
human beings prompted 48.2 percent of the students to make the
choice.

<HEADLINE> Martin, Fung Win Hong Kong Badminton Open Titles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Third-seeded Fung Permadi
from Chinese Taipei and Denmark's second seed Camilla Martin
defeated their opponents in the finals to win the men's and
women's singles titles at the 1996 Hong Kong Badminton Open
Championships here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian-born Fung, 29, defeated unseeded Indonesian
Salim 15-12, 15-10. Salim upset third-seeded Dane Thomas
Stuer-Lauridsen 15-11, 15-10 Saturday to qualify for the final.
</P>
<P>
Fung moved to Taiwan two years ago for a better chance for his
career and has been playing for the Taiwan Cooperative Bank. The
winner of the recent China Open in Dongguan, South China, said he
felt better there as the tournament drew more top-level players.
</P>
<P>
"We'll try to extend our contract with him after the current
contract expires next spring," said Yeh Kuo-Huei, manager of the
Chinese Taipei team.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that Fung act as a playing coach in the future so as
to bring up more players for the team.
</P>
<P>
Martin, ranked eighth in the world, scored a comparatively easy
 11-8, 11-6 victory over the 17-year-old Indonesian sensation.
</P>
<P>
She owed much of her victory to the numerous unforced errors
made by her opponent.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't use any special tactics today. I just played my
normal game," she added.
</P>
<P>
"I've played so many tournaments since the Olympic Games, and
Ireally felt very tired today," admitted Audina.
</P>
<P>
"And the injuries on my body did affect my performance today,"
she added.
</P>
<P>
But she still plans to compete in the coming Thai Open, the
Grand Prix Finals and perhaps the World Cup later this year.
</P>
<P>
Men's doubles top seeds Antonius and Deny Kantono beat
second-seeded Malaysians Yap Kim Hock and Cheah Soon Kit 15-6,
15-3 for the title.
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Danes Marlene Thomsen and Lisbet Stuer-Lauridsen in
the women's doubles downed second-seeded Indonesians Indarti
Isolina and Deyana Lomban 15-9m 15-12 to take the title.
</P>
<P>
The mixed doubles title went to second-seeded Michael Sogaard
and Rikke Olsen who downed fifth seeds Ericksen and Mariene
Thomsen 15-8, 15-11.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Abderrazak Haki of Morocco
won the men's title and Tatiana Titova was awarded the women's
champion of the 17th annual Columbus Marathon held in Columbus,
Ohio today.
</P>
<P>
Haki and Titova finished their races in 2 hours, 17 minutes and
28 seconds and in 2:28:05 respectively in the 26.2-mile
(42.195-km) event joined by more than 4,000 others.
</P>
<P>
They were each awarded 5,000 U.S. dollars, while the
second-place finishers each received 2,500 dollars and third-place
runners, 1,500 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Haki, 24, was the first man to have won a consecutive title in
the Columbus event since 1993. He won last year's title in
2:15:56 in his first marathon.
</P>
<P>
The 1992 and 1993 titles winner was Brad Hudson of Oregon of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Haki was running with four other leaders in most of the race,
but he began to take the lead in the 22th mile and covered the
final 4.2 miles in 21:44.
</P>
<P>
Peter Fleming of Scotland won the second-place and South
Africa's Hendrick Maako finished third.

first mile and finished about one minute ahead of U.S. runner
Wendy Nelson-Barret.

GENEVA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland's chances of
reaching the 1998 World Cup finals took a battering in Berne on
Sunday as they suffered their second Group 3 defeat against
Norway, who maintained their 100 percent record with a 1-0 victory.
</P>
<P>
Wimbledon midfielder Oyvind Leonhardsen hit the decisive goal
on 32 minutes, snapping up a rebound after Swiss keeper Marco
Pascolo had parried a drive from Tore Andre Flo.

Thereafter the visitors kept their shape at the back to deny a
Swiss side visibly short on confidence since losing their opening
qualifying match in Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland, who reached the second phase of the 1994 World Cup
in the United States, now have a mountain to climb if they are to
qualify for the finals in France. Earlier Sunday, Hungary's 3-0
win in Azerbaijan hoisted them into second place.

BELGRADE, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Favourites Bosnia handed
Slovenia their fourth successive World Cup qualifying defeat when
they scored a 2-1 victory in group one in Ljubljana on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The loss left Slovenia with no chance of reaching the World
Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
It was Bosnia's second victory against two defeats in the
group.
</P>
<P>
Bosnia set the early pace and striker Elvir Bolic opened the
scoring in the fifth minute when he ploughed through Slovenia's
weak defence and fired in a high shot over goalkeeper Bosko
Boskovic's head.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian goalkeeper Mirsad Dedic denied Slovenia an equaliser
in the 26th minute when he safely caught a thundering 20-metre
free kick from forward Alfred Jermanis.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Meho Kodro made it 2-0 when he dribbled past three
Slovenian defenders and the goalkeeper to net from close range in
the 32nd minute.
</P>
<P>
The Slovenians were awarded a penalty after goalkeeper Dedic
fouled forward Saso Udovic. It was converted by midfielder Zlatko
Zahovic in the 41st minute.

Real Madrid striker Predrag Mijatovic struck on 18 minutes
following an astute through pass by Juventus star Vladimir Jugovic

game safe for the hosts, while Japan-based Dragan Stojkovic and

<HEADLINE> Chinese-Made Coins Sold Overseas Flowing Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese coins are best-sellers
for foreign coin merchants at the ongoing '96 Beijing
International Coin Convention, which features more than 70
overseas participants and 40 local mints and dealers.
</P>
<P>
Chinese-manufactured gold and silver coins are now flowing back
to their homeland through various channels, according to many coin
collectors and merchants attending the exhibition, the second of
its kind held in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Fred Weinburg, an American coin dealer since the early 80s,
said that most Chinese coin buyers are true collectors, while in
the US, coin buyers are more likely to be investors.
</P>
<P>
In the past, European and US coin markets were hot, Weinburg
said, but China's is now hotter.
</P>
<P>
A German dealer from the Hamburger Coin Trade Co. Ltd. said the
prices of Chinese coins are currently 50 percent lower in price in
Germany than in China.
</P>
<P>
"I'm regretting that I have brought too few Chinese coins here,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Becker predicted that the prices in Chinese and foreign markets
will soon be leveled, due to the rapid flow of information about
the field.
</P>
<P>
China issued its first commemorative coins in 1979, and since
then has sold 100,000 to 200,000 ounces of gold coins a year,
mostly to overseas markets, according to Yang Fuji, Deputy General
Manager of China Gold Coin Incorporation.
</P>
<P>
He said the problem of the returning of Chinese coins to China
should be tackled, but it is complicated and its solution takes
time.
</P>
<P>
Some local experts said many Chinese stamp collectors have
turned to coins in response to the long-time sluggish stamp trade
in the country.

<HEADLINE> Russia Vows to Track Down Bombers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin tonight demanded action against gangland bombers who
blew up a cemetery in Moscow killing 13 people and injuring 30.
</P>
<P>
Police have launched a major operation to hunt down the
perpetrators of Sunday's spectacular attack on mourners
commemorating the death of the leader of an Afghan war veterans
group.
</P>
<P>
"This (the incident) is a challenge to the Interior Ministry
and it cannot go unheeded," the prime minister said in a speech.
</P>
<P>
But the chances of the police catching the bombers are slim.
Russia has been swallowed up in a wave of violent organized crime
and mafia style killings have become commonplace since the
collapse of the Soviet Union and the ensuing economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Yet few bombings and gangland murders have been cleared up.
</P>
<P>
The explosion took place about noon (0900 GMT) while a funeral
ceremony was under way at the Kotlyakovaskoye cemetery in southern
Moscow to commemorate Mikhail Likhodei, the former head of the
Afghan War Invalids Foundation, who was murdered near his
apartment block on November 10, 1994.
</P>
<P>
Among those killed today were Likhodei's widow, mother and
uncle and his successor.
</P>
<P>
Police said the bomb, equivalent to between two and five kg of
explosives, went off under a table laden with food and drink for
the 130 mourners.
</P>
<P>
The explosion sent bodies flying across the graveyard and made
a crater four meters wide in the ground, Russian television
pictures showed.
</P>
<P>
The bomb was believed to be a settling of scores among
criminals associated with veterans groups, which benefit from
generous tax breaks.

<HEADLINE> Typhoon Leaves 16 Dead, 12 Missing in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Typhoon Ernie blew out of
northern Philippines Saturday night, leaving 16 dead, 5 injured
and 12 missing, according to disaster and weather authorities.
</P>
<P>
Ernie is heading toward the South China Sea, the Philippine
Atmosphere, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration
(PAGASA) said.
</P>
<P>
Ernie had unleashed heavy rains and flash floods to the Visayas
and Northern Mindanao since last week, driving about 5,000 out of
their homes and causing millions of pesos loss in agriculture and
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
At least two highways and a road were closed in the Visayas due
to floods and landslides.
</P>
<P>
President Fidel Ramos Sunday declared a state of calamity in 14
provinces and eight cities ravaged by Ernie, the 16th storm to
enter the country this year.
</P>
<P>
Ramos approved the release of 4.3 million pesos (16,400 US
dollars) from the Calamity Fund for relief and rescue operations.
</P>
<P>
He also directed National Defense Secretary Renato S. de Villa
to alert all regions, especially coastal areas, ships and
fishermen, in the path of another Typhoon, Dale.
</P>
<P>
Weathermen from the PAGASA said Dale is roaring closer to Luzon
Island, packing sustained winds of up to 175 kilometers per hour
and gusts of up to 210 kmh.
</P>
<P>
Dale, which could develop into a "super typhoon," is capable of
"uprooting trees and causing flash floods," they said.
</P>
<P>
But they added that there was a possibility that Dale will not
hit land unless it moves to the west.
</P>
<P>
As of 4 p.m. Sunday, Dale was moving northwest at 26 kmh toward
eastern Luzon and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Storm Signal No. 1 was hoisted over Batanes group of islands,
eastern section of Luzon, including Samar provinces. These areas
will have rains and winds of 30 to 60 kmh beginning Monday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine National Red Cross said it was preparing for
another massive disaster relief operation in the wake of Dale.
</P>
<P>
An average of 20 storms and typhoons hit the Philippines each
year.

MANILA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Two persons have died and 62

<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, November 11 (Xinhua) -- A 500 million yuan spending
spree by a Beijing-based telecom giant has dialed success in
east China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
The money has been spent on a range of telecommunications
projects by China Unicom's branch in the province, giving new
impetus to the provincial telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
China Unicom -- the China United Telecommunications Corporation
-- is a major state-owed telecommunications company authorized by
the State Council, China's highest administrative body.
</P>
<P>
It was established by the Ministry of the Electronics Industry,
Ministry of the Power Industry and Ministry of Railways, as well
as being joined by 13 large state-owned enterprises, to provide
basic telecommunications services.
</P>
<P>
Projects funded with the 500 million yuan include the first
phase of construction of the provincial GSM network, switching
networks, and digital microwave transmission trunks linking Xiamen
with the provincial capital of Fuzhou.
</P>
<P>
The Fujian Unicom branch has imported mobile phone switchboards
from Germany's Siemens AG, and radio base stations from the US's
Motorola company, to open a GSM 130 network.
</P>
<P>
The network spans 11 cities and four counties, including
Fuzhou, Xiamen and Quanzhou.
</P>
<P>
Fujian Unicom aims to raise overseas funds to improve the
provincial telecom sector, by expanding coverage of mobile telecom
network, adding long-distance transmission lines, and building
telecom networks integrated with services such as cable TV, and
telephone and data transmission.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Reduce Products Tariffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines plans to bring
down tariffs on all products, except for rice and other "sensitive
agricultural products," traded with the rest of the Asia-Pacific
region to 5 percent in the next eight years, a local newspaper
said today.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines presented to the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum a detailed plan of liberalizing trade and
leveling the playing field to attract more foreign investors,
according to the Individual Action Plan (IAP) which was obtained
by the newspaper Today.
</P>
<P>
"The targeted final rate under the (Tariff Reform Program) is a
uniform rate of five percent by the year 2004, except to sensitive
agricultural products whose tariffs are set inter-alia per (World
Trade Organization) commitments," the document said.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, the Philippine government plans to reduce
tariff levels on petroleum products to 11.33 percent and the
tariff on chemical and photographic supplies to 4.61 percent. It
will also phase down tariffs imposed on countries carrying the
Most-Favored-Nation status.
</P>
<P>
Currently the Philippine government slaps an average tariff
rate of 15.57 percent on the different products entering the
country -- from as high as 27.43 percent on agricultural products,
except fish, to as low as 6.25 percent on non-electrical
machinery.
</P>
<P>
Under the action plan, rice will also be shielded with
non-tariff barriers. Other sensitive agricultural products,
petroleum products and new motor vehicles or trucks have been
stripped off the quota requirements since October last year.
</P>
<P>
The importation of metals, chemical and photographic supplies
and transport equipment will be less costly as import licensing
will eventually be lifted within the eight-year period.
</P>
<P>
On the energy sector, the Philippines projects that "all
regulations on oil price setting, including the Oil Price
Stabilization fund and the foreign exchange cover will be removed"
as the oil deregulation policy matures by the year 2000. The
regulations on the importation of coal will also be lifted by that
time.

ISTANBUL, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Turkey dominated the full
ninety minutes of their Group seven World Cup qualifying round
against San Marino on Sunday with an easy 7-0 win.
</P>
<P>
Striker Derelioglu Oktay, who plays with '94-'95 Turkish league
champions Besiktas, hammered home four of his team's seven goals.
</P>
<P>
He was well supported in his goal hunt by midfielders Kerimoglu

Turkish side dominated possession.
</P>
<P>
Striker Hakan Sukur, nick-named the "Bull of the Bosporus",
Turkey's internationally best-known player, scored twice in the
second half, but surprisingly missed a few opportunities.
</P>
<P>
San Marino, for their part, only tried to keep the ball out of
their penalty area as much as possible, making almost no efforts
to score.
</P>
<P>
Their goalkeeper Gaperoni, however, made five excellent saves,
preventing an even worse defeat for his side.

<HEADLINE> Polluting Companies Closed To Keep Beijing's Water Clean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDE, November 11 (Xinhua) -- In the tourist city of Chengde,
to the north of the Chinese capital, 610 companies that were
causing pollution have been shut down to keep them from polluting
the water of nearby Beijing and Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
The Chaohe River, which flows through Chengde in Hebei
Province, provides 93 percent of the Panjiakou, and 57 percent of
the Miyun reservoir's water, the two main water suppliers for the
two most important cities in north China.
</P>
<P>
To protect these sources, the Chengdu City government has put a
special group in charge of polluters. Chengde's mayor, Fu Guiwu,
said, "In order to give Beijing and Tianjin's residents clean
water, those of us upstream are willing to suffer economic losses."
</P>
<P>
According to local figures, closing so many companies in
Chengde may result in more than 62 million yuan (about 7.5 million
US dollars) in losses annually.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the province of Liaoning also closed 63 small paper
mills, 14 dye manufacturers with an annual output of less
than 500 tons each, 49 tanneries, and more than 550 companies
involved in oil refining, gold extraction, and asbestos products.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Abderrazak Haki of Morocco
won the men's title and Tatiana Titova was awarded the women's
champion of the 17th annual Columbus Marathon held in Columbus,
Ohio today.
</P>
<P>
Haki and Titova finished their races in 2 hours, 17 minutes and
28 seconds and in 2:28:05 respectively in the 26.2-mile
(42.195-km) event joined by more than 4,000 others.
</P>
<P>
They were each awarded 5,000 U.S. dollars, while the
second-place finishers each received 2,500 dollars and third-place
runners, 1,500 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Haki, 24, was the first man to have won a consecutive title in
the Columbus event since 1993. He won last year's title in
2:15:56 in his first marathon.
</P>
<P>
The 1992 and 1993 titles winner was Brad Hudson of Oregon of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Haki was running with four other leaders in most of the race,
but he began to take the lead in the 22th mile and covered the
final 4.2 miles in 21:44.
</P>
<P>
Peter Fleming of Scotland won the second-place and South
Africa's Hendrick Maako finished third.

first mile and finished about one minute ahead of U.S. runner
Wendy Nelson-Barret.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland's chances of
reaching the 1998 World Cup finals took a battering in Berne on
Sunday as they suffered their second Group 3 defeat against
Norway, who maintained their 100 percent record with a 1-0 victory.
</P>
<P>
Wimbledon midfielder Oyvind Leonhardsen hit the decisive goal
on 32 minutes, snapping up a rebound after Swiss keeper Marco
Pascolo had parried a drive from Tore Andre Flo.
</P>
<P>
Thereafter the visitors kept their shape at the back to deny a
Swiss side visibly short on confidence since losing their opening
qualifying match in Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland, who reached the second phase of the 1994 World Cup
in the United States, now have a mountain to climb if they are to
qualify for the finals in France. Earlier Sunday, Hungary's 3-0
win in Azerbaijan hoisted them into second place.

<P>
BELGRADE, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Favourites Bosnia handed
Slovenia their fourth successive World Cup qualifying defeat when
they scored a 2-1 victory in group one in Ljubljana on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The loss left Slovenia with no chance of reaching the World
Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
It was Bosnia's second victory against two defeats in the
group.
</P>
<P>
Bosnia set the early pace and striker Elvir Bolic opened the
scoring in the fifth minute when he ploughed through Slovenia's
weak defence and fired in a high shot over goalkeeper Bosko
Boskovic's head.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian goalkeeper Mirsad Dedic denied Slovenia an equaliser
in the 26th minute when he safely caught a thundering 20-metre
free kick from forward Alfred Jermanis.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Meho Kodro made it 2-0 when he dribbled past three
Slovenian defenders and the goalkeeper to net from close range in
the 32nd minute.
</P>
<P>
The Slovenians were awarded a penalty after goalkeeper Dedic
fouled forward Saso Udovic. It was converted by midfielder Zlatko
Zahovic in the 41st minute.

BELGRADE, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia gained a vital
three points with a 1-0 win over Czech Republic 1-0 in a World Cup
group six qualifier here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Real Madrid striker Predrag Mijatovic struck on 18 minutes
following an astute through pass by Juventus star Vladimir Jugovic
to the delight of a 50,000 crowd as his side made it four wins out
of four.
</P>
<P>
The Czechs stepped up the pressure in the remainder of the
first half and Pavel Kuka spurned two good chances when he had
only keeper Aleksandar Kocic to beat.
</P>
<P>
Just after the restart, Jugovic missed a chance to make the
game safe for the hosts, while Japan-based Dragan Stojkovic and
Sasa Curcic of English Premiership side Aston Villa also came
close.
</P>
<P>
Liverpool's Czech star Patrik Berger then saw a late drive
beaten out by Kocic as the Yugoslavs held on to stay top of the
group with 12 points, three ahead of Slovakia who play Spain on

<HEADLINE> Chinese-Made Coins Sold Overseas Flowing Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese coins are best-sellers
for foreign coin merchants at the ongoing '96 Beijing
International Coin Convention, which features more than 70
overseas participants and 40 local mints and dealers.
</P>
<P>
Chinese-manufactured gold and silver coins are now flowing back
to their homeland through various channels, according to many coin
collectors and merchants attending the exhibition, the second of
its kind held in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Fred Weinburg, an American coin dealer since the early 80s,
said that most Chinese coin buyers are true collectors, while in
the US, coin buyers are more likely to be investors.
</P>
<P>
In the past, European and US coin markets were hot, Weinburg
said, but China's is now hotter.
</P>
<P>
A German dealer from the Hamburger Coin Trade Co. Ltd. said the
prices of Chinese coins are currently 50 percent lower in price in
Germany than in China.
</P>
<P>
"I'm regretting that I have brought too few Chinese coins here,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Becker predicted that the prices in Chinese and foreign markets
will soon be leveled, due to the rapid flow of information about
the field.
</P>
<P>
China issued its first commemorative coins in 1979, and since
then has sold 100,000 to 200,000 ounces of gold coins a year,
mostly to overseas markets, according to Yang Fuji, Deputy General
Manager of China Gold Coin Incorporation.
</P>
<P>
He said the problem of the returning of Chinese coins to China
should be tackled, but it is complicated and its solution takes
time.
</P>
<P>
Some local experts said many Chinese stamp collectors have
turned to coins in response to the long-time sluggish stamp trade
in the country.

the survey.
</P>
<P>
About two thirds of those who take "being a scientist" as their
ideal explained that to be a scientist accords with their own
interests and hobbies. That scientists are great contributors to
human beings prompted 48.2 percent of the students to make the
choice.

<HEADLINE> Martin, Fung Win Hong Kong Badminton Open Titles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Third-seeded Fung Permadi
from Chinese Taipei and Denmark's second seed Camilla Martin
defeated their opponents in the finals to win the men's and
women's singles titles at the 1996 Hong Kong Badminton Open
Championships here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian-born Fung, 29, defeated unseeded Indonesian
Salim 15-12, 15-10. Salim upset third-seeded Dane Thomas
Stuer-Lauridsen 15-11, 15-10 Saturday to qualify for the final.
</P>
<P>
Fung moved to Taiwan two years ago for a better chance for his
career and has been playing for the Taiwan Cooperative Bank. The
winner of the recent China Open in Dongguan, South China, said he
felt better there as the tournament drew more top-level players.
</P>
<P>
"We'll try to extend our contract with him after the current
contract expires next spring," said Yeh Kuo-Huei, manager of the
Chinese Taipei team.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that Fung act as a playing coach in the future so as
to bring up more players for the team.
</P>
<P>
Martin, ranked eighth in the world, scored a comparatively easy
 11-8, 11-6 victory over the 17-year-old Indonesian sensation.
</P>
<P>
She owed much of her victory to the numerous unforced errors
made by her opponent.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't use any special tactics today. I just played my
normal game," she added.
</P>
<P>
"I've played so many tournaments since the Olympic Games, and
Ireally felt very tired today," admitted Audina.
</P>
<P>
"And the injuries on my body did affect my performance today,"
she added.
</P>
<P>
But she still plans to compete in the coming Thai Open, the
Grand Prix Finals and perhaps the World Cup later this year.
</P>
<P>
Men's doubles top seeds Antonius and Deny Kantono beat
second-seeded Malaysians Yap Kim Hock and Cheah Soon Kit 15-6,
15-3 for the title.
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Danes Marlene Thomsen and Lisbet Stuer-Lauridsen in
the women's doubles downed second-seeded Indonesians Indarti
Isolina and Deyana Lomban 15-9m 15-12 to take the title.
</P>
<P>
The mixed doubles title went to second-seeded Michael Sogaard
and Rikke Olsen who downed fifth seeds Ericksen and Mariene
Thomsen 15-8, 15-11.

LONDON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Ireland dropped their first
points of the World Cup qualifying campaign after finishing a
goalless draw with Iceland in Dublin on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Two headers by Tony Cascarino in the first half were just wide
of the mark and a virtuoso display by comeback man Roy Keane
brought occasional cheer to the 33,869 fans.

With the draw, Ireland dropped to the second place in group 8
after Macedonia's massive 11-1 hammering of Liechtenstein on
Saturday.

Goal difference keeps the Macedonians ahead and they provide

<HEADLINE> No Turning Back On Europe In UK: CBI/BCC Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARROGATE, ENGLAND, November 10 (Xinhua) -- British business
remains firmly committed to the UK's membership of the European
Union (EU) and strongly supports keeping open the option of
joining the European Monetary Union (EMU), according to a major
new survey released here today.
</P>
<P>
The key results of the survey show: 87 percent of the firms
conducted think the UK's best interests are served by staying in
the EU. Only 8 percent favor withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-eight percent believe the single market has improved
business opportunities within the EU, with 13 percent disagreeing.
Fifty-one percent believe it has brought real benefit to their
individual company, against 25 percent who have not directly
benefited.
</P>
<P>
However, 32 percent still feel that it has failed to remove
previous barriers to trade in the EU, while 40 percent believe it
has.
</P>
<P>
Thirty percent of those questioned say the UK's membership of
the EU has made it more likely for them to invest in the UK, while
only 3 percent think it less likely.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-six percent of firms support the principle of the UK
participating in the EMU, while 30 percent are opposed.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the survey, David Richardson, president of the
British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said, "This survey indicates
yet again that business has no doubts whether we should be in or
out of Europe."
</P>
<P>
"It believes that we are in, we are right to be in and we
should stay in. There is a strong view that it is our politicians
that are letting us down."
</P>
<P>
"The message from business is clear: stop playing games with
our future in Europe. What business needs is a government which is
clearly committed to Europe, influential in the key decisions in
Europe and able to give business the certainty with which to plan
for the future," he added.
</P>
<P>
Colin Marshall, CBI president, also said this afternoon at a
press conference, "Firms remain very positive about membership of
the European Union, for practical not starry-eyed reasons...to
reject it now would give us no say as to how the Euro-coin
eventually falls."
</P>
<P>
The survey shows there is continued concern over the level of
the debate on Europe in the UK. Fifty-eight percent of firms think
that the political debate has harmed the government's ability to
influence EU policy.
</P>
<P>
On the EMU, 61 percent of firms think they do not have enough
information to plan effectively should the UK join a single
currency. And 57 percent think they are ill-informed as to how to
plan if the UK stays out.
</P>
<P>
Concerns remain about continued unfair competition, although
this figure is down on last year. Forty-nine percent said they
continued to experience unfair competition in the single market:
of these 32 percent blame uneven enforcement of EU legislation in
other member states, and 30 percent complain of over-zealous
implementation by UK authorities.
</P>
<P>
There is strong support in the survey for Britain's opt-out
from the Social Chapter. Seventy-three percent agree it should be
retained with 20 percent disagreeing.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted independently by MORI on a random
sample basis on behalf of the CBI and BCC.

<HEADLINE> US President Says Balanced Budget to Be Top Priority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
has pledged that the top priority of his new administration will
be to agree with Republicans on a balanced budget.
</P>
<P>
"That's plainly the message of the election," Clinton said in
an interview with ABC which was broadcasted today. He said he
thought that "psychologically and in fact economically it is very
important for America to have a balanced budget."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that if he could pass only one thing in the coming
year, it would be a balanced budget plan to open the door for more
Americans to attend college and continue efforts to broaden health
care coverage.
</P>
<P>
Under strong pressure from Republicans, President Clinton
signed on to the need for a balanced budget timetable last year.
But he vetoed twice the packages for balancing the budget put
forward by Republicans because of a big difference between the
government and Republican-controlled Congress on the plan.
</P>
<P>
The battle over the balancing the budget about a year ago, a
prelude of this year's presidential election, resulted in two
partial government shutdowns totaling 27 days.
</P>
<P>
However, President Clinton said in the interview that his
balanced-budget talks with Republicans came very close to success.
</P>
<P>
"We were very very close in dollar numbers, so I would think it
would be easily achievable," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is to meet with U.S. Congressional leaders this week to
discuss the agenda for the 105th Congress which will begin in
coming January.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb Army New Commander to Reorganize Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Maj.-Gen. Pero Colic, who
replaced Gen. Ratko Mladic as the new Serb army commander, said in
Pale today that the efforts to reorganize the Serb army and make
it professional would continue.
</P>
<P>
Priority would be given to personnel matters and the matter of
financing the army, Colic told reporters after he was sworn in as
the chief of staff of the Serb army.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was attended by Serb President Biljana Plavsic,
who signed the decree Saturday to dismiss Mladic "due to strong
international pressure." She also replaced more than 80 other
senior officers.
</P>
<P>
"The general staff is composed of competent and proven fighters
for Republika Srpska," the Tanjug news agency quoted Colic as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The Serb Supreme Defense Council Saturday appointed Gen. Colic
chief of staff, and Maj.-Gen. Dragan Josipovic the deputy
commander.
</P>
<P>
The army's supreme command, which was headed by Gen. Mladic,
was renamed the general staff under a parliament decision on
September 12.
</P>
<P>
Mladic led the Bosnian Serb army throughout the three and half
year civil war and was the most popular military leader in the
Serb republic. He was indicted in November 1995 by the Hague-based
U.N. War Crimes Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and was banned
from taking public office by the Dayton peace agreement.

<HEADLINE> Britain's SFO to Investigate Eurotunnel Share Dealings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Serious Fraud Office
(SFO) has agreed to investigate claims made by the French
authorities about market manipulation in Eurotunnel shares
dealings dating back to 1994.
</P>
<P>
SFO spokesman James O'Donoghue said earlier today that the SFO,
which is responsible for investigating major financial crimes,
"has agreed to investigate on behalf of the French authorities
allegations of market manipulation in Eurotunnel shares."
</P>
<P>
The Eurotunnel shares have been among the most volatile of all
those quoted on the London and Paris stock markets, making them a
more likely target for inside trading.
</P>
<P>
The French police authorities have reportedly alleged that
sensitive commercial information about the financial restructuring
of Eurotunnel has been leaked to speculators.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman stressed that the information to be
gathered by the SFO would be for the French authorities only. "We
don't have grounds to investigate allegations of market
manipulations on a domestic level," he said.

<HEADLINE> Zairean Tutsis Want "Absolutely Impartial" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The Zairean Tutsi rebels today
said that the multinational intervention force to be deployed in
what they called "liberated zones" of Zaire must be "absolutely
impartial."
</P>
<P>
The Agence France Presse (AFP) quoted Laurent Kabila,
coordinator of the Alliance of Democratic Force for the Liberation
of Congo-Zaire (ADFLCZ), as saying that humanitarian groups should
first contact the ADFLCZ for authorization for entering Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Giving a press conference in a villa beside the Lake Kivu in
Goma, the Zairean Tutsi leader said that his soldiers could also
open another human corridor toward the refugee camp of Mugunga,
where 400,000 refugees are on the verge of death.
</P>
<P>
The Mugunga camp is reportedly controlled by Zairean troops and
Rwandan Hutu extremists, who were accused by the ADFLCZ of using
refugees as human shields in resisting the advance of Tutsi
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Some 700,000 other refugees are stacked in a small bay beside
the Lake Kivu, 27 kilometers from Goma.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that the refugees, especially children and the
elderly, are dying in thousands while diarrhoea, cholera and other
epidemics are spreading among them.

<HEADLINE> American Tax Crackdown Mission Costs Greece 1.8 Mln Dlrs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- American experts from the U.S.'
Internal Revenue Service (IRS), who came here last August to help
the Greek government catch tax evaders, will cost Greece over 414
million drachmas (1.8 million U.S. dollars) to no avail -- for the
time being at least.
</P>
<P>
The infuential Greek weekly To Vima (tribune) said today that
the American experts have found their mission a tougher going than
they had expected and declared their efforts as pointless as a
result of the chaos and corruption surrounding the Greek state.
</P>
<P>
As time rolls on, the IRS officials are all the more convinced
that, as things currently stand, nothing can be done to clamp down
effectively on rampant tax evasion due to the country's outdated
tax system.
</P>
<P>
The paper alleged that Greece's Tax Department is not backed by
a computerized system which would allow for direct access to
details on taxpayers, while banks and insurance companies keep
financial details of their clients under wraps. Furthermore, local
tax officials are inadequately trained for the job.
</P>
<P>
As for the remuneration packaged for the IRS officials, the
paper said they will each receive 314,302 U.S. dollars for the
first year and 321,391 dollars for the second. Travel allowance
money has been set at 100,998 for year one and 114,854 for the
second, while contingency spending has been set at 9,400 and 8,000
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Greece's Finance Ministry has put together a coordinating
committee which controls two teams, each comprised of four local
tax officials, and set up specifically to collaborate with the IRS
tax experts.
</P>
<P>
Greece is well known for its tax evasion and according to the
latest report, the total back taxes owed by private citizens and
public utilities total 2.2 trillion drachmas (about 95.7 billion
U.S. dollars), about 10 percent of Greece's gross domestic
product.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Manufacturers on Government's 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Manufacturers in Nigeria today
suggested that the government should place the main thrust of its
budget for 1997 on growth stimulation, while addressing the
problem of low industrial capacity utilization and high level of
unsold inventories.
</P>
<P>
Domestic demand should be stimulated in the first half of 1997
to reverse the slow-down in economic growth and the dismal
performance of the manufacturing sector which now has a capacity
utilization of only 31 percent, according to the pre-budget
memorandum of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN).
</P>
<P>
The document stressed monetary and fiscal policies should be
sufficiently reflationary to stimulate growth and employment.
</P>
<P>
This suggestion echoes that of the National Association of
Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA).
</P>
<P>
In its memorandum to the federal government concerning the
composition of the 1997 budget, the NACCIMA suggested acclerated
economic recovery and growth stimulation through cautious
reflatory measures and controlled inflation.
</P>
<P>
The MAN documents, citing available data from the World Bank,
said gross savings and investments in Nigeria between 1995 and
1996 are projected at less than 15 percent of the gross domestic
product.
</P>
<P>
In order to increase savings and investments, particularly
foreign direct investment, the MAN said, efforts should be made
to reduce inflation substantially and avoid volatility in real
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign investor-friendly climate, efficient bureaucracy and
good returns on investment are necessary, not only to reverse the
recent trend of divestment of foreign investors, but also attract
and sustain fresh foreign direct investment," it said.
</P>
<P>
Both the MAN and the NACCIMA believe that their suggestions
can be achieved through consistent policies in an environment of
political stability, security of life and property and improved
social and economic infrastructure.
