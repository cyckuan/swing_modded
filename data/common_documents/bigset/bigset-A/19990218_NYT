GIULIANI WARMS TO TALK ABOUT SENATE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York City may be consistently coy
about his precise political aspirations these days, but the hosts
of the Cable News Network's ``Crossfire'' are paid to get to the
point. ``We are all salivating for the mother of all campaigns,''
Bill Press bluntly told the mayor, who smiled broadly through his
appearance on the show on Wednesday night. ``I hope you don't
disappoint us.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasing speculation that Hillary Rodham Clinton might
challenge the mayor in a race for the U.S. Senate next year _
fueled this week by comments from the president and the first lady
herself _ has had Giuliani ducking questions daily about his own
plans. (He cheerfully acknowledges, however, that his three
political fund-raising committees are chugging steadily ahead.)
</P>
<P>
   But aglow in the national spotlight of CNN on Wednesday night,
Giuliani softened a bit. ``Ha ha ha,'' the mayor laughed before
telling Press that while he has not made any definite plans, ``I
enjoy politics, I wouldn't be in it if I didn't, and I can
understand the kind of fascination with the idea of a race like
this.'' It was an unusual admission that he, too, is enjoying all
of the speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of decisions that I have to make about the
mayoralty, the job that I am doing right now, succession to it,''
Giuliani said. ``But I guess I would _ I'd be be less than candid
if I didn't say that the idea of a race like this is kind of
intriguing. I mean, it would be a very important race nationally.
It would contrast two very different philosophies of governing, and
it'd be an interesting race.''
</P>
<P>
   Press, quoting a poll by the Marist Institute showing that Mrs.
Clinton would beat the mayor handily, goaded him, suggesting that
he might not be up to the fight. ``So, are you saying Hillary is
not going to scare you off?'' he asked. The mayor maintained the
light vein. ``Oh come on,'' Giuliani said, ``you know that that's
not the case. Come on.''
</P>
<P>
   The interview had its serious moments, with Giuliani responding
to questions about the Republican Party, about the shooting death
of an unarmed immigrant by four police officers and about his
controversial remarks that other states should gladly accept New
York City's trash in exchange for enjoying the city's cultural
life.
</P>
<P>
   If Giuliani seemed more willing to discuss a prospective Senate
run, there were also moments when he backed off. Asked if he would
turn controversies surrounding the Whitewater land deal or the FBI
files that involved Mrs. Clinton into issues in a Senate campaign,
he refused to say. ``I am not going to focus on a hypothetical race
like that and the questions that I would ask or not ask,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But when his hosts suggested that he return to debate Mrs.
Clinton on ``Crossfire,'' he graciously accepted. Smiling broadly
again, Giuliani said: ``That would be great fun.''

SIMPSON AUCTION ITEMS TORCHED IN RALLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PETER HARTLAUB  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Colorado-based World Wide Web site rushed $16,000
worth of O.J. Simpson memorabilia from the auction block to the
downtown criminal courthouse steps Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Then they smashed the cache and set it on fire.
</P>
<P>
   Their point?
</P>
<P>
   ``We want legal reform!'' Denver radio personality Bob Enyart
screamed to a crowd of about 500, as men in ``ShadowGov.com''
T-shirts attacked two Simpson jerseys and two trophies with a
sledgehammer and lighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judges and lawyers in this courthouse share the guilt for
the bloodshed in this city,'' Enyart added.
</P>
<P>
   Like an audience from ``The Jerry Springer Show,'' most who
showed up for the demonstration had a hostile reaction toward the
participants, but kept watching anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's wrong,'' Dorothy Evans said as the remains of
Simpson jerseys smoldered a few feet away. ``Why (are) they burning
up the man's clothes when they could give them to the Salvation
Army?''
</P>
<P>
   The 30-minute event promoted by ShadowGov.com was part Springer,
part Gallagher, part Beavis and Butt-head, and all by the book,
according to fire and police officials who were on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pre-approved event,'' said Los Angeles fire
Inspector Ben Flores. ``They called for permits (last week) and
they got them.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that there weren't any rules. Enyart and his cohorts were
restricted from using lighter fluid, and the area had to be taped
off by police before the protest could begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the crowd was out of control, it wouldn't have happened,''
Flores said. ``If the weather was adverse it wouldn't have
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, it was a beautiful day to smash O.J.'s stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Unless, of course, you were among the vocal portion of the crowd
who started protesting the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway through the presentation, Alex Fernandez grabbed a
ShadowGov.com shirt and threw it on the burning pile of Simpson
jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles resident said he thought the conservative group,
which passed out Christian literature after the protest, came with
racist intentions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just kept getting angrier and angrier the more they
talked,'' Fernandez said after it was all over.
</P>
<P>
   Evans screamed ``Idiots!'' at the protesters when they started
attacking the trophies with tentative blows.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could have sent those clothes to someone on the East
Coast,'' the 57-year-old grandmother from Los Angeles said. ``It's
cold out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of ShadowGov.com spent $4,750 on the jerseys and $10,000
on Simpson's professional football Hall of Fame award during
Tuesday night's auction, during which more than $430,000 worth of
Simpson memorabilia was sold.
</P>
<P>
   They carried off the debris in a box and announced plans to melt
down the metal and mold it into a knife with the inscription ``O.J.
did it. June 12, 1994'' -- all for display on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In a very un-L.A. move, the protesters were whisked away in
taxicabs.
</P>
<P>
   While the dissenters were the loudest, there were plenty in the
crowd who didn't have a problem with the protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``They own it,'' said Michael Sriro of Beverly Hills. ``I guess
they can do what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Legally, Sriro is correct, said Los Angeles police Sgt. Gary
MacNamara.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously not everyone was happy but, hey, they've got a right
to free speech, too.''

FOX SETTLES MATTER OF SIXTH MAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Rick Fox's sore feet made way for Kobe Bryant's new
career as a starting forward, and Bryant's breakthrough
performances have made the arrangement all but permanent.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Del Harris wouldn't say so, but now Fox will. Concerned
that a controversy could be brewing, Fox volunteered Wednesday to
be the Lakers' sixth man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leave it at that. Put that to rest. I'm the guy that comes off
the bench,'' Fox said. ``Del's letting it go, so I'm putting an end
to it.''
</P>
<P>
   In training camp, Harris had toyed with the idea of a three-man
rotation of Fox, Bryant and Eddie Jones at the small forward and
shooting guard positions, primarily as a means of getting Bryant
some starts.
</P>
<P>
   He ditched that decidedly unpopular plan, then fate took care of
the rest. Fox was dealt sore feet and knees, Robert Horry missed
games because of illness and his son's birth, and Bryant seized the
opportunity. He's averaging 19.9 points and 9.0 rebounds as a
starter.
</P>
<P>
   But with Fox ready to return to full-time duty, he's hearing
chatter _ mostly from outside the Forum _ that there's some kind of
struggle for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing could be further from the truth, said Fox, who has
maintained all along that he'll do whatever the team needs. And
he's certainly not willing to let the issue become another
distraction to a team that has too many already.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm settling it, because my name is in it, and I'm tired of
hearing that I have a problem with my teammate,'' Fox said. ``My
brother calls me and says he hears on the radio that (Kobe and I)
have a beef or something. Please.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing to hear the things people come up with.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox scored a team-high 20 points off the bench Tuesday, after
recovering from a viral infection.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said who starts should never be an issue and that the
lineup will still be subject to change, but he seemed pleased with
Fox's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds good,'' he said. ``What I'm hoping to hear is that
everyone is willing to accept a role on the team. That's what good
teams are made of.''
</P>
<P>
   Worm watch: Another day, another rumor, another denial.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report published Wednesday, the elusive Dennis
Rodman spoke with Lakers executive Jerry West by phone Tuesday and
explained he would make a decision on whether to join the team
after consulting with wife Carmen Electra.
</P>
<P>
   Not true, said West.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an absolute fabrication,'' West said. ``I did not talk
to Dennis Rodman, period. I don't know where people are getting
these stories. It gets to the point where you wonder, `Where the
hell are these things coming from?' ''
</P>
<P>
   And no one seems to know if or when Rodman will finally make up
his mind. He reportedly was set to join the Lakers, but a series of
media reports pegging his arrival date have been off the mark.
</P>
<P>
   The latest popular theory has Rodman signing in time to make his
debut on Friday's nationally televised game against San Antonio.
West said he didn't know when to expect Rodman and seemed irritated
by the waiting game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get through this just like everyone else,'' he
said.

<P>
   a week since I got the hot ``tip'' about discrimination against
students at Shadow Mountain High School, and the young man on the
telephone wanted to know why I hadn't done anything about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was officially sanctioned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know,'' he's told. ``I spoke to the principal about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's racism! Doesn't that bother you, man?'' he said, his
anguished voice rising in hope of unearthing some shred of human
decency and fair play.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he was told.
</P>
<P>
   Several parents also called. And other students.
</P>
<P>
   It was bigotry, they all said, the kind of blatant bias based on
skin color that people like me are supposed to expose, to hold up
for public ridicule and condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would write about it if the situation were reversed,'' one
parent told me. ``And the TV people would be all over it, too. It
would be a BIG story all over the country. Can you imagine?''
</P>
<P>
   If the situation were reversed, the story would go something
like this:
</P>
<P>
   White students at Shadow Mountain High School were invited to
listen to a speech by a successful White man in connection with an
ongoing series of school-sanctioned programs celebrating White
History Month. Pizza was served at the event. No Black students
were invited.
</P>
<P>
   And, yeah, every hack in town, me included, would have jumped
it.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't happen that way.
</P>
<P>
   It involved Black History Month.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators at overwhelmingly White Shadow Mountain arranged
for a principal at another high school, a successful
African-American man, to speak to Black students at the Shadow
Mountain. About 50 attended, Principal Connie Liddle told me. Free
pizza was served.
</P>
<P>
   The event was followed, almost immediately, by whining.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never occurred to me it would be taken that way,'' said
Principal Liddle. ``It was really very much of a surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   The principal's office took complaints. The newspaper. Talk
radio stations. From behind the high walls of their red-tiled
enclaves in north Phoenix, lily-white crusaders stormed forth,
armed with the swords of self-righteousness and the shields of
moral indignation.
</P>
<P>
   They believed the attention to Black History Month had gone too
far. It was political correctness in the extreme, they said, and
they were determined to fight it _ with even MORE political
correctness.
</P>
<P>
   Which would be silly if it weren't so unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   For most kids, I'd guess the only thing worse than being
excluded from a Black History Month lecture _ or any speech about
history _ is being ``invited'' to such a lecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had calls from parents because the kids went home and said
it was unfair,'' Principal Liddle said. ``I've said to those
parents, `Apparently, I made a mistake.' Sometimes you do.
Sometimes you misjudge. If I erred, then I apologize.''
</P>
<P>
   Will administrators face the same problem on Cinco De Mayo? And
Columbus Day? And St. Patrick's Day?
</P>
<P>
   Will there be an uproar when non-members of the track team or
marching band or chess club aren't invited to a group meeting?
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly will think twice before I do anything like that
again,'' Liddle said. ``All we can do is to try to enjoy each
other's differences, and to develop awareness as much as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking as a longtime White man, I might be able to provide
some insight into the expressed outrage.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, we're a fair-minded, fair-skinned people. We
accept and even encourage minority groups who want to celebrate
their uniqueness.
</P>
<P>
   We've adapted to changes in public policy and personal conduct.
We've adjusted to alterations in language and lifestyles. But, even
we can be pushed too far, and in this case, I believe we we were.
</P>
<P>
   You can deny us our own special minority status, our own special
lingo, our own special history month. You can deny us access to any
lecture you want.
</P>
<P>
   But, when you start denying us free pizza . . . &QL;

GERMANY, CLINTON JOIN DRIVE TO STOP EXECUTION OF 2 BROTHERS IN
ARIZONA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK SHAFFER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ From President Clinton to Gov. Jane Hull, the German
government is putting on a full court press to try to save the
lives of two brothers scheduled to be executed for a grisly 1982
murder.
</P>
<P>
   German citizens Karl and Walter LaGrand, who were born in
Germany and raised in southern Arizona, are scheduled to go to the
gas chamber at the Arizona State Prison in Florence, Karl next
Wednesday and Walter on March 3, for the 1982 murder of Marana bank
manager Kenneth Hartsock.
</P>
<P>
   That the brothers chose gas for death, given the country's Nazi
Holocaust past, isn't the only thing unusual. Four of the five
German nationals on death rows in U.S. prisons are in Florence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone back decades and decades looking for other German
nationals executed in the U.S. and haven't found any,'' said Jean
Pierre Rollin, Germany's deputy counsel general in Los Angeles.
``Now, we possibly have two in Arizona in the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very strange. It certainly has raised a lot of attention
in Germany and throughout Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   The other two Germans, brothers Rudi and Michael Apelt, are on
death row at Florence for the 1988 killing of Michael Apelt's
U.S.-born wife in hopes of cashing in on a $400,000 insurance
policy. The only other German death-row inmate is in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   German officials are hoping for the same results as Mexican
diplomats, who were instrumental in getting the death sentence of
double murderer Ramon Martinez-Villareal stayed by the U.S. Supreme
Court in 1997. Efforts by the Honduran government to save the life
of citizen Jose Roberto Villafuerte last April were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Hull met for 30 minutes with Germany's top two diplomats in the
U.S. on Tuesday about the cases. Top German government officials in
Bonn also have contacted President Clinton, Attorney General Janet
Reno and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, pleading for
clemency. German representatives of Amnesty International are
planning to file an appeal in the World Court.
</P>
<P>
   A large contingent of German officials and media are expected to
attend Karl LaGrand's hearing before the State Board of Executive
Clemency next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   From Munich to Hamburg, the media have been saturated in recent
weeks with death-row feature stories about the LaGrand brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Hull listened to all of their concerns,'' said Francie
Noyes, the governor's spokeswoman. ``But one thing in her mind
always is the victim and family members of the victim.''
</P>
<P>
   According to court records, 35-year-old Karl LaGrand was the
third of three illegitimate children from different GI fathers born
to their German mother, Emma, in the small Bavarian city of
Augsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Their mother then married a U.S. Army soldier, who adopted the
children, and the family moved to this country in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Karl was a troubled child who first got in trouble with the law
at age 9 when he stole $9.69 from a store in Sierra Vista and a
pair of shoes from another store two months later. Emma LaGrand
said that Karl and Walter also set fire to a golf course, which did
$20,000 damage, while the family lived at a military post in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Karl bounced between home, programs for troubled youths and
juvenile centers until he and Walter were convicted of the armed
robbery of three Tucson supermarkets in a six-day period in 1981.
They both were imprisoned at that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Karl never wanted to learn. He always got F's in school,''
Emma LaGrand told Pima County probation workers. ``They (Karl and
Walter) liked to run around like dogs. They should be treated like
dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   After their release, the brothers wanted a quick fix for their
money woes.
</P>
<P>
   So, they drove north on Interstate 10 to the Valley National
Bank in Marana at dawn on the morning of Jan. 7, 1982, waiting for
bank personnel to come to work. They brought a briefcase with a
steak knife, bandanas, electrical tape, police radio scanner and
toy gun inside.
</P>
<P>
   Hartsock, the bank manager, showed up a few minutes later and
brought the U.S. and Arizona flags outside to be raised for the
day. Karl pulled the toy gun and ordered him inside the building.
</P>
<P>
   A 20-year-old female teller pulled up a few minutes later. The
two told the LaGrand brothers that they only knew half of the
combination to the safe and that they would have to wait for a
third bank employee to report to work before it could be opened.
Hartsock and the woman were then bound and gagged.
</P>
<P>
   The LaGrands became increasingly anxious as the other employee
failed to show up. Hartsock, believing that Karl LaGrand was about
to attack the woman, kicked him in the shins. A savage response
ensued.
</P>
<P>
   Hartsock's throat was slashed and he suffered 23 other knife
wounds, at least six of which could have been fatal, investigators
said. The woman also was stabbed seven times in the head, side and
shoulder but survived.
</P>
<P>
   Carla Ryan, Karl LaGrand's Tucson attorney, said she thinks she
has ``a good shot'' at getting his death sentence commuted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing planned. It was just part of a terrible
accident,'' Ryan said. ``When the victim kicked Karl in the leg, he
grabbed a letter opener and just freaked out. They had been about
to give up and leave at that point.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan also said she hopes the clemency board will consider the
prolonged suffering that inmate Donald Eugene Harding suffered when
he was executed by the use of gas in 1992. Lethal injection has
been used in other executions since that time.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, German press accounts have focused on the veritable
German colony of death-row inmates that has come about at the
Florence prison, noting that the Apelt brothers are only a couple
of cells removed from the LaGrands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, everybody goes nuts time and again,'' Karl LaGrand told
one German reporter. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   White students at Shadow Mountain High School were invited to
listen to a speech by a successful White man in connection with an
ongoing series of school-sanctioned programs celebrating White
History Month. Pizza was served at the event. No Black students
were invited.
</P>
<P>
   And, yeah, every hack in town, me included, would have jumped
it.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't happen that way.
</P>
<P>
   It involved Black History Month.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators at overwhelmingly White Shadow Mountain arranged
for a principal at another high school, a successful
African-American man, to speak to Black students at the Shadow
Mountain. About 50 attended, Principal Connie Liddle told me. Free
pizza was served.
</P>
<P>
   The event was followed, almost immediately, by whining.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never occurred to me it would be taken that way,'' said
Principal Liddle. ``It was really very much of a surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   The principal's office took complaints. The newspaper. Talk
radio stations. From behind the high walls of their red-tiled
enclaves in north Phoenix, lily-white crusaders stormed forth,
armed with the swords of self-righteousness and the shields of
moral indignation.
</P>
<P>
   They believed the attention to Black History Month had gone too
far. It was political correctness in the extreme, they said, and
they were determined to fight it _ with even MORE political
correctness.
</P>
<P>
   Which would be silly if it weren't so unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   For most kids, I'd guess the only thing worse than being
excluded from a Black History Month lecture _ or any speech about
history _ is being ``invited'' to such a lecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had calls from parents because the kids went home and said
it was unfair,'' Principal Liddle said. ``I've said to those
parents, `Apparently, I made a mistake.' Sometimes you do.
Sometimes you misjudge. If I erred, then I apologize.''
</P>
<P>
   Will administrators face the same problem on Cinco De Mayo? And
Columbus Day? And St. Patrick's Day?
</P>
<P>
   Will there be an uproar when non-members of the track team or
marching band or chess club aren't invited to a group meeting?
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly will think twice before I do anything like that
again,'' Liddle said. ``All we can do is to try to enjoy each
other's differences, and to develop awareness as much as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking as a longtime White man, I might be able to provide
some insight into the expressed outrage.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, we're a fair-minded, fair-skinned people. We
accept and even encourage minority groups who want to celebrate
their uniqueness.
</P>
<P>
   We've adapted to changes in public policy and personal conduct.
We've adjusted to alterations in language and lifestyles. But, even
we can be pushed too far, and in this case, I believe we we were.
</P>
<P>
   You can deny us our own special minority status, our own special
lingo, our own special history month. You can deny us access to any
lecture you want.
</P>
<P>
   But, when you start denying us free pizza . . . &QL;

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ The apparel-collecting Astros fan will want to
add the team's new batting-practice cap to his or her collection.
It features a slightly different logo; the familiar open star now
has an orbital-like circle around it.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps a bull's eye would have been more appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   As back-to-back defending champions of the National League
Central, the Astros are the prime target for the Cardinals, Cubs,
Reds, Brewers and Pirates. It's a new role for the Astros, who have
grown accustomed to being one of the hunters rather than the
hunted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact some people may consider us the favorite is
different, but in the final analysis it's all the same,'' Astros
manager Larry Dierker said. ``All you can try to do is win as many
games as you can and hope it's enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros were unlikely division champions in Dierker's rookie
season despite winning a modest 84 games. The team exceeded almost
everyone's expectations in 1998, capturing a franchise-record 102
games and repeating as the division winner. A level of success
somewhere between Dierker's first two seasons would seem enough to
put the Astros in position for a third consecutive title.
</P>
<P>
   But Dierker realizes several variables to which the Astros
seemed immune last season could come into play in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have to be cognizant of the fact it's possible to have a
letdown and that some things may go wrong,'' he said. ``But instead
of trying to force the issue, we may have to remind the guys that
if we're going to win this thing, we're going to have to earn it.''
</P>
<P>
   Preparation begins today, when pitchers and catchers hit the
practice fields for their first workout of the spring. While little
is ever accomplished before the full squad reports, Dierker and his
staff hope to use the remainder of the week to familiarize
themselves with some of the new pitchers in camp.
</P>
<P>
   It's an opportunity for roster candidates such as Dean Crow,
Brian Powell, Brian Williams, Jeff McCurry and Bob Scanlan to plant
an early seed in the manager's head. For youngsters such as Wade
Miller, Derek Root and Tony McKnight, it's a chance to strut their
stuff before major-league coaches for the first time. And then
there are pitchers such as Chris Holt and Jose Cabrera, who will
try to re-establish themselves after missing last season because of
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm anxious to see all of the new guys,'' Dierker said. ``I'm
also anxious to see Holt. I saw him pitch a little bit at the
Astrodome, but I'm anxious to see him down here. I'm excited to see
Cabrera and where he is with his arm right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Barring a trade for Roger Clemens _ still a possibility _ the
real excitement is likely on hold until the position players report
Monday. Shortly thereafter, Dierker hopes to see the Astros develop
the hunger that made them twice-crowned champions of their
division.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're probably not going to win 100 games again, and it's
probably not going to be as easy as it was last season,'' Dierker
said. ``But we have to want it just as much. If we still want it
just as much, then we have just as good a chance of winning as
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you right now I think we have a better team coming
into spring training than we had at this time a year ago. But it's
still unlikely _ even with a better team _ that you win 100 games.
It just doesn't happen that often. We could have more injuries. We
could have some guys who don't have good years. It's just not
likely that everything will fall into place the way it did last
year. But you still have to like our chances a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Astros are favorites to win their division, general
manager Gerry Hunsicker still believes the underdog tag fits his
team in relation to the postseason. The Astros are 1-6 in the
playoffs under Dierker, having been eliminated in the first round
in each of the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have challenges,'' Hunsicker said. ``After last
season, people were questioning whether we had the right mix. They
think something is missing because we haven't gotten past the first
round.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to win the division again and then win the World
Series. I think there is more pressure to win now because the
expectation is that we'll win our division; it's almost a foregone
conclusion. We really lost a great opportunity last season. Not
only did we have a good club on paper, but everything just went
right. Now, we have to prove that we can get past the first round,
and that's pressure.''

INTEL DEBUTS NEW PENTIUM III CHIP, PROCESSOR BUILT FOR HIGH
GRAPHICS   
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Watch a movie on your computer and you get to
pick the ending. Or surf the Web and see 3-D images. Or tour a
model home that hasn't been built.
</P>
<P>
   Intel Corp. gave a preview Wednesday of some 200 applications
that use the strengths of its new Pentium III, the world's fastest
desktop processor.
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest chipmaker says the Pentium III and its
applications will add new life to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology is very good and could be groundbreaking in
terms of graphics,'' said Scott Hudson, senior analyst for PC
technology at Scottsdale-based Cahners In-Stat Group.
</P>
<P>
   But he and others say the glitzy new features will be a tough
sell to business users who may balk at the price.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that people will be very impressed with this, but
most people will say, `That's nice, but I'd just as soon pass,' ''
Hudson said.
</P>
<P>
   Elaborate graphics, video and sound quality typically don't
prompt most businesses to plunk down big bucks for a new computer,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentium III begins rolling out of Intel's U.S. manufacturing
plants in Chandler and Albuquerque on Feb. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Software optimized for the new processor promises improvements
in voice recognition and in video streaming and 3-D animation for
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the Pentium III will have a clock speed of 500 Mhz.
Intel is expected to release a 550 Mhz version in the second
quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   With a background of bouncy swing music, Intel launched a $300
million marketing campaign for Pentium III, its largest ever.
</P>
<P>
   The blitz, including commercials promising that the Pentium III
will make the Internet ``a whole lot more fun,'' is more than just
an effort to sell the processor. It may also be a fight to curb the
trend of people prefering cheaper computers, said Van Baker, an
analyst with Dataquest, a San Jose research firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's a pretty important campaign for Intel,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the biggest names in computing, including Microsoft and
IBM, came out for Wednesday's preview in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharper Image was there, showing off its Web site with 3-D
drawings of 25 products that users can move and turn around.
</P>
<P>
   If you have unique products, customers need to be able to see
what they are like, said Richard Thalheimer, The Sharper Image's
chairman and founder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so much more fun for the customer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Excite also showed its 3-D Web search engine, called
Excitextreme, that lets users pick where they want to go from a
rotating carousel of topics.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the right way for people to navigate the Web,'' Baker
said.
</P>
<P>
   A space-age, 3-D, shoot-'em-up game by British-based Rage Games
Ltd. showed flowing water, cracks in the ground and other details.
</P>
<P>
   ``It added another level of realism,'' Rage sales director
Philip Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   Several business applications were also on display, including
speech dictation products with greater accuracy, speed and
vocabulary. Pentium III-powered computers can learn a new user's
voice in about five minutes, while other machines typically take
half an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy concerns have overshadowed the processor's debut.
</P>
<P>
   Each chip comes with an identifying serial number intended to
enhance e-commerce security and help corporations track computers.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy rights groups were furious and demanded that Intel
change the signature setup, saying it would allow companies to
build detailed consumer profiles that could be sold. Intel
responded by changing the identifying system so that it can be
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   The processor also comes with 70 new multimedia instructions
that improve graphics and video performance.
</P>
<P>
   The new chip will compete with Intel's own Pentium II, a 450 Mhz
processor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a relatively minor enhancement over the Pentium II,''
said Peter Glaskowsky, a senior analyst with ``The Microprocessor
Report,'' a newsletter published in Sunnyvale, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   But the new Pentium III does not make the Pentium II obsolete,
Intel argues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (the Pentium II) is still a great machine,`` spokesman Tom
Waldrop said. ``This is the march of technology.
</P>
<P>
   Intel won't announce the processor's cost until it begins
shipping them. Typically, Intel starts its new processors at around
$800. That price results in a complete computer for about $2,000.
The processor price generally drops by half in about nine months.
</P>
<P>
   Some think the Pentium III could start much lower than $800, as
competition among top-speed processor manufacturers drives prices
down.
</P>
<P>
   Intel is battling to prevent rivals such as Advanced Micro
Devices from stealing market share. Intel remains the world's
largest chipmaker, with $26.2 billion in sales last year.
</P>
<P>
   As prices drop, analysts expect the Pentium III to gain
popularity by the end of this year, if not sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just depends on the wow factor,'' Hudson said. &QL;

CLOCK BEGINS TICKING TO AVERT STRIKE AGAINST AMERICA WEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAWN GILBERTSON AND PETER CORBETT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ With America West jets taking off every few minutes in
the background, the airline's flight attendants on Wednesday
started a countdown to a strike that would ground flights at a few
minutes' notice.
</P>
<P>
   The clock on the federally mandated 30-day cooling-off period
between management and the Association of Flight Attendants union
has started ticking and officially ends at 10 p.m. Arizona time on
March 19, a Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Unless a contract agreement is reached by then _ something both
sides say they will strive for in stepped-up talks over pay issues
_ the union will start its long-threatened CHAOS campaign.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative to a total walkout, CHAOS stands for Create Havoc
Around our System and involves intermittent walkouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can design it any way we want to,'' Bill McGlashen,
president of the AFA Council 66 at America West, said in announcing
the strike countdown at Sky Harbor International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be one-hour strikes here and there. It could be strikes
on flights headed to the East Coast, or flights heading to the West
Coast. A two-day shutdown. A four-day shutdown.''
</P>
<P>
   America West won't know what's on tap until it gets a call from
a union official saying that flight attendants won't be staffing
certain flights, McGlashen said. That could occur as little as 15
minutes before takeoff, he said. Flight attendants will not walk
off any flights after they have boarded, however, because that
would be illegal.
</P>
<P>
   America West, Sky Harbor's busiest carrier, with 214 daily
departures, could opt to shut down entirely to avoid a string of
last-minute surprises for customers.
</P>
<P>
   CHAOS ``may require AWA to shut down its operations and furlough
many of its employees in order to protect our customers from
service disruptions,'' Richard Goodmanson, president and chief
operating officer, said in a memo to employees last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The notice about possible layoffs, which the airline said could
occur as early as March 15, is required by the Worker Adjustment
and Retraining Notification Act.
</P>
<P>
   A strike, which would hit in the peak of the Valley's tourist
season, would come after four years of often tense negotiations
between the two sides. A tentative contract was overwhelmingly
rejected by the flight attendants in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Other offers have been bandied about, but union leaders say
America West's offer is $16.5 million less than what they are
seeking for the 2,400 America West flight attendants. Over a
five-year contract, that amounts to $3.3 million a year in salary
that divides the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   The union wants to increase top salaries from about $22,000
annually to $32,000.
</P>
<P>
   America West says on average its flight attendants are paid
$22,856 annually for about 29 hours per week of work, which does
not include their time for layovers or overnight stays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not here because we want to get rich and we have dollar
signs in our eyes,'' McGlashen said. ``We're here because we want a
fair, reasonable agreement. That's what the union has on the table.
What the company has on the table . . . doesn't recognize the
sacrifices that employees have made'' since the carrier's
bankruptcy reorganization in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers will hear plenty from the flight attendants in the
next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Friday at the Camelback Esplanade in Phoenix, the
union will hand out pamphlets warning of the strike and the union's
position. The campaign will continue with meetings with companies
that book a lot of travel on America West, as well as students
planning spring break trips.
</P>
<P>
   The union is calling it an educational campaign, but the intent
is clear: Get the public to put more pressure on America West
management to settle.
</P>
<P>
   No negotiations are now scheduled, McGlashen said, but the plan
is to have non-stop talks to reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   America West concurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Number One goal is to reach a fair and responsible
agreement with the flight attendants and avoid any disruption of
service to our customers,'' Greg Garger, vice president of labor
relations, said in a statement. ``We are hopeful we will achieve
that over the next 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   A settlement would be welcome news to the Valley's tourist
industry and the throngs of travelers who live here and help make
America West the top airline at Sky Harbor International Airport,
with about 42 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
   The strike would start the weekend that the NCAA West Regional
mens basketball tournament is to be played at America West Arena.
Games are scheduled March 18 and March 20. Also that weekend is the
LPGA Standard Register Ping golf tournament.
</P>
<P>
   There would be 10 days of spring training baseball games left, a
couple of big conventions, and countless vacations scheduled at the
Valley's resorts and hotels.
</P>
<P>
   For local travelers, it could disrupt spring break plans,
business trips and, possibly, Easter vacations. &QL;

DODGERS GIVING FANS TICKET PLAN OPTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Editors: Also moving in the ``a'' national and ``n'' California
news files.) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Almost everything concerning the Los Angeles
Dodgers this year is new: their manager (Davey Johnson), their ace
pitcher ($105 million man Kevin Brown), their road uniforms (``Los
Angeles'' on the front), their look (no facial hair), and their
great expectations.
</P>
<P>
   OK, those are the same old expectations, but spring training
starts today so the expectations feel new.
</P>
<P>
   That newness extends into the stands, as well.
</P>
<P>
   The team is offering up a new pitch when it comes to buying
tickets and, well, the front office expects it to be a home run
among the fans.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the truest blue can buy tickets in 15- or
20-game blocks. And, in a carry-over from last year, the team is
offering 81-game season tickets at half price in one of the upper
decks.
</P>
<P>
   In most major-league cities this would not be unusual, but the
Dodgers are steeped in tradition, including a more traditional way
of selling tickets: Just roll out the baseballs and either sell
tens of thousands of season tickets or make the faithful buy them
one game at a time.
</P>
<P>
   So the new marketing plan is, well, as radical as an exploding
scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   It is also not an idea original to the Dodgers. Teams swap
players and recycle the same old managers all the time so boosting
ticket sales by lifting a good idea from, say, the hated San
Francisco Giants, is not as felonious as stealing their signs.
</P>
<P>
   The home team says it is fielding these ticket-buying plans to
make it easier on the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we found in our research is a large portion of our fans
came to 10 to 20 games a year, which works out to two to three a
month. And what they were doing was (forming) into groups and
getting season tickets and dividing them up,'' said Bob Wymbs, the
Dodgers director of marketing. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The new plan makes it less expensive, and less complicated, for
fans to satisfy their baseball cravings.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, fans had to buy either season tickets for all 81
regular-season games or purchase each game separately.
</P>
<P>
   Season tickets for box seats and the preferred reserved section
usually cost a dollar or two less on a per-game-basis. But the cash
outlay still could range from $891 to $1,134 for one season ticket.
Toss a couple of friends or family members into the mix and you're
getting into the new car or home down-payment league.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, making it to Dodger Stadium for every home game can
become an obligation rather than fun.
</P>
<P>
   The 15- and 20-game packages are priced at $6 (the top deck and
pavilion) and $16 (field level) on a per-game basis, the same as if
tickets to each game were purchased separately. But they also come
with an option to buy tickets for the playoffs or World Series,
should the team finally play up to its great expectations.
</P>
<P>
   And while these plans have a ``miniseason ticket'' feel to them,
there is one big difference from the real deal: ``Mini'' holders
are not guaranteed the same seat for every game, though they will
be in the same general area. And, to put it mildly, they won't
exactly be the best seats in the house.
</P>
<P>
   The very best seats always go to full season ticket holders, and
Dodgers officials say there probably will be about 22,000 full
season ticket holders this year. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The Dodgers, ever shrewd marketers even as the team's on-field
skills eroded over the past few years, gave the new campaign a
retro look and have given each package a theme.
</P>
<P>
   One of the 15-game packages, for example, is the ``Home Run
Derby'' and it features games against St. Louis (with home run
champ Mark McGwire), Seattle (Ken Griffey Jr.) and the Chicago Cubs
(Sammy Sosa).
</P>
<P>
   Fans can also choose a package of any 20 games, including an
opening-day epic that features ace Brown against his Arizona
Diamondbacks counterpart Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Two other 15-game plans can be arranged around weekends or those
special give-a-ways for which baseball is famous. These include
home run champion McGwire's Bean Bear, runner-up Sammy Sosa's Bean
Bear and the KISS-FM Rock Around the Park Concert featuring Bryan
Adams, a rocker, not a slugger.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers officials say they are traveling this marketing route
because they want to, while other teams have done it because they
had to.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Anaheim Angels, one of the least popular
attractions in Walt Disney Co.'s empire, implemented a 20-game
``you pick 'em'' plan. The team sold 8,000 packages, which put the
success rate in ``Fantasyland.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was beyond our wildest dreams,'' said Larry Cohen, the
team's director of ticket sales. ``I think people like the option
of picking the games they want to go to.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The Giants were one of the originators of the minipackages and
have been among the most successful at selling them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't sell full season tickets and the Dodgers market
can,'' said Mark Norelli, the Bay Area team's vice president of
ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   Norelli said it's tougher for the Giants to sell full season
tickets because the price is higher and demand isn't as great as
supply. It costs more because the Giants don't own the stadium they
play in so they have to charge more for tickets and demand doesn't
suck up the supply because the Giants stadium seats more than
65,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people can come to the gate any time and buy a ticket
there is no sense in buying a season ticket,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Dodger Stadium has about 56,000 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, when the Giants move into a new stadium next year,
the partial season packages may be phased out. After all, there
will be the attraction of a new stadium to draw fans, plus with
only 42,000 seats the supply will be more limited.
</P>
<P>
   Norelli wondered whether the Dodgers are doing the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are taking a huge gamble here, in my estimation. It's
none of my business what they do but when you start selling smaller
packages, guess what, people start buying smaller packages,'' he
said. ``But they are also exposing the game to a lot more people.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Dodgers often can flub up on the field, market analyst
David Carter at the Los Angeles-based Sports Business Group said
the team rarely makes errors at the gate.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said the new plan puts a block of games with season
ticket cache within economic reach of families with young children.
</P>
<P>
   Just possibly, new family traditions, and a whole bunch of
potential season ticket holders at some future date, will be born
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the general things that happens with the Dodgers is
that they do a tremendous job of marketing. And they don't always
make their market strategy and maneuvers well known,'' Carter said.

DODGERS GIVING FANS TICKET PLAN OPTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Almost everything concerning the Los Angeles
Dodgers this year is new: their manager (Davey Johnson), their ace
pitcher ($105 million man Kevin Brown), their road uniforms (``Los
Angeles'' on the front), their look (no facial hair), and their
great expectations.
</P>
<P>
   OK, those are the same old expectations, but spring training
starts today so the expectations feel new.
</P>
<P>
   That newness extends into the stands, as well.
</P>
<P>
   The team is offering up a new pitch when it comes to buying
tickets and, well, the front office expects it to be a home run
among the fans.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the truest blue can buy tickets in 15- or
20-game blocks. And, in a carry-over from last year, the team is
offering 81-game season tickets at half price in one of the upper
decks.
</P>
<P>
   In most major-league cities this would not be unusual, but the
Dodgers are steeped in tradition, including a more traditional way
of selling tickets: Just roll out the baseballs and either sell
tens of thousands of season tickets or make the faithful buy them
one game at a time.
</P>
<P>
   So the new marketing plan is, well, as radical as an exploding
scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   It is also not an idea original to the Dodgers. Teams swap
players and recycle the same old managers all the time so boosting
ticket sales by lifting a good idea from, say, the hated San
Francisco Giants, is not as felonious as stealing their signs.
</P>
<P>
   The home team says it is fielding these ticket-buying plans to
make it easier on the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we found in our research is a large portion of our fans
came to 10 to 20 games a year, which works out to two to three a
month. And what they were doing was (forming) into groups and
getting season tickets and dividing them up,'' said Bob Wymbs, the
Dodgers director of marketing. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The new plan makes it less expensive, and less complicated, for
fans to satisfy their baseball cravings.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, fans had to buy either season tickets for all 81
regular-season games or purchase each game separately.
</P>
<P>
   Season tickets for box seats and the preferred reserved section
usually cost a dollar or two less on a per-game-basis. But the cash
outlay still could range from $891 to $1,134 for one season ticket.
Toss a couple of friends or family members into the mix and you're
getting into the new car or home down-payment league.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, making it to Dodger Stadium for every home game can
become an obligation rather than fun.
</P>
<P>
   The 15- and 20-game packages are priced at $6 (the top deck and
pavilion) and $16 (field level) on a per-game basis, the same as if
tickets to each game were purchased separately. But they also come
with an option to buy tickets for the playoffs or World Series,
should the team finally play up to its great expectations.
</P>
<P>
   And while these plans have a ``miniseason ticket'' feel to them,
there is one big difference from the real deal: ``Mini'' holders
are not guaranteed the same seat for every game, though they will
be in the same general area. And, to put it mildly, they won't
exactly be the best seats in the house.
</P>
<P>
   The very best seats always go to full season ticket holders, and
Dodgers officials say there probably will be about 22,000 full
season ticket holders this year. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The Dodgers, ever shrewd marketers even as the team's on-field
skills eroded over the past few years, gave the new campaign a
retro look and have given each package a theme.
</P>
<P>
   One of the 15-game packages, for example, is the ``Home Run
Derby'' and it features games against St. Louis (with home run
champ Mark McGwire), Seattle (Ken Griffey Jr.) and the Chicago Cubs
(Sammy Sosa).
</P>
<P>
   Fans can also choose a package of any 20 games, including an
opening-day epic that features ace Brown against his Arizona
Diamondbacks counterpart Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Two other 15-game plans can be arranged around weekends or those
special give-a-ways for which baseball is famous. These include
home run champion McGwire's Bean Bear, runner-up Sammy Sosa's Bean
Bear and the KISS-FM Rock Around the Park Concert featuring Bryan
Adams, a rocker, not a slugger.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers officials say they are traveling this marketing route
because they want to, while other teams have done it because they
had to.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Anaheim Angels, one of the least popular
attractions in Walt Disney Co.'s empire, implemented a 20-game
``you pick 'em'' plan. The team sold 8,000 packages, which put the
success rate in ``Fantasyland.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was beyond our wildest dreams,'' said Larry Cohen, the
team's director of ticket sales. ``I think people like the option
of picking the games they want to go to.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The Giants were one of the originators of the minipackages and

GORE JUST MISSES BIG HOMECOMING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ He's not playing in the Nissan Open this week, but
give Jason Gore time. That's all he needs.
</P>
<P>
   The former Hart High star, two-time individual Pac-10 champion
at Arizona and leader of Pepperdine's charge to the 1997 NCAA team
championship, came within one round of setting up a memorable
homecoming last week.
</P>
<P>
   After shooting 7-under-par 65 in a Monday qualifier for the
Buick Invitational in San Diego, Gore opened 68-68-70 at Torrey
Pines and was tied for 13th at 10 under par entering the final
round of a competition that would earn its top 10 finishers
automatic berths into the next PGA Tour event.
</P>
<P>
   That would be this week at Riviera Country Club, close enough to
Gore's Valencia home to call home.
</P>
<P>
   But the burly, good-natured former state amateur and state open
champ couldn't quite keep up the pace on Sunday, slumping to a tie
for 26th.
</P>
<P>
   Even that disappointment left him smiling, as Gore finished
eagle-eagle in a closing round of 73.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of rare feat that wowed the CBS announcers
covering the event and confirmed the suspicion of Gore's caddie,
Winston Prince, that he was on the bag of another winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've caddied for David Duval,'' Prince said, ``and I'm not
prejudiced or anything, but Jason physically has the same skills
and ability David did when I saw him when he was younger.''
</P>
<P>
   Prince, who caddied for Gore last year on the Nike Tour, thinks
it's just a matter of time before Gore will break through to earn
his tour card.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen him play as well as some of the top players in the
world,'' Prince said. ``I've been fortunate to see a lot of good
golfers, and he's got the potential to be right up there with any
of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gore is learning from the lumps of the game after a
sensational 1997, when he followed an NCAA team title and two state
individual championships with a berth on the U.S. Walker Cup team,
then got to the final stage of Tour Qualifying school before
burning out short of his goal.
</P>
<P>
   On the verge of earning PGA Tour status or at least full-time
Nike Tour privileges, he had to settle instead for conditional Nike
status. Then, after struggling there last year, Gore was no longer
eligible for Nike participation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a quick fall,'' he said. ``It happens, and you just try
to keep smiling, I guess. You get up and you do your thing. You
mature very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore is trying to build his game back up with plenty of
practice and participation on the Teardrop Tour and other
mini-tours, he showed last week at Torrey Pines that he isn't far
away from realizing his goal.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe next year at Riviera. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Call him ace: Westlake High senior J.T. Kohut is at it again. On
the first day of practice, on the first hole, he hit another
hole-in-one. This would be his 14th ace and his second on a par-4.
Kohut drove the near-300-yard first at Westlake Village to get his
season started fast. Last year, he aced a par-4 at Sunset Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Kohut, who has narrowed his college choices to USC and UCLA,
expects to make a decision by April. He kept alive the recruiting
interest last week before his latest double-eagle ace, nearly
qualifying for the Nissan Open. Kohut lost in a three-way playoff
for the second and final berth after shooting 2-under-par 72 at Los
Serranos South on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Cougar watch: College of the Canyons, which has won six Western
State Conference championships during the 1990s, could be fielding
another team as strong as its 39-1 edition of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Gary Peterson returns Alex Kuyumjian and Carlos Robledo,
who finished 1-2 in conference last year, and adds a strong new
player in Pat Kelly from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Other top prospects include Mike Applegate, son of Antelope
Valley pro Steve Applegate, redshirts Travis Matye and Sean Oriti
and freshmen Adrian Tan and Geoff Volker Hart and Mike Scott from
Alemany.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson, who has produced three state finalists, including a
state champion in 1993, thinks this team could be as strong as any
he has fielded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never had any previous team shoot below 404 at
Brookside,'' he said. ``This team shot 384 there. They're good, and
the competition on the team will make them better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars will hold their annual fund-raising tournaments
Monday and March 1 at Valencia Country Club. Entry fee of $125 per
player in the five-man scramble format will go to support Canyons
golf. Information: (805) 259-7800.
</P>
<P>
   Police fund raiser: Officers of the West Valley Community Police
Station are sponsoring the first WVal Open, March 1 at Braemar
Country Club. Entry fee to the scramble competition is $115 per
player. Proceeds will help finance station participation in several
LAPD athletic competitions throughout the year. Information: (818)
756-8550. &QL;

UCLA EARNS VOLLEYBALL SWEEP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cal State Northridge's men's volleyball team might not believe
it, but UCLA's Adam Naeve was sick Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   No one could tell because Naeve gave Northridge a queasy feeling
with 15 kills and just two errors in the No. 2-ranked Bruins' 15-2,
15-6, 15-3 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation victory at
Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one other fact to make Matadors fans ill: The 11 points
scored is the third fewest in school history. CSUN scored 10 each
against UCLA in 1997 and Penn State in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``God, this is pitiful,'' Northridge coach Jeff Campbell
muttered after his team lost its seventh straight match and dropped
to 1-8, 1-7. ``We played pretty poorly tonight. It's a combination
of them being very good and us not very good. It's as bad as we've
played all year.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA (10-2, 8-1) outhit Northridge 58-27. Beside Naeve, Mark
Williams got 13 kills and Danny Farmer got 10 kills.
</P>
<P>
   No Matador finished with more than Eckhard Walter and Junior
Mosones' eight kills apiece.
</P>
<P>
   One area the Matadors are deficient is in the middle. No one can
stop the 6-foot-9 Naeve, in part because no one in the middle is
tall enough. The two tallest middles, 6-7 Adam Black and 6-8 Brian
Hughlett, combined to play three games. Each finished with two
kills and two errors.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Naeve, a junior, is that good. He is being considered for
the U.S. National team.
</P>
<P>
   Yet on Wednesday, he was feeling the effects of a virus, so he
wasn't sure how he would perform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't as motivated,'' he said. ``Being sick, you either
play really bad or you play pretty good to make up for being
sick.''
</P>
<P>
   After being set once in the first game, Naeve got his share in
the final two games, partially because setter Brandon Taliaferro
decided to set him more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of three sets, Naeve's going to get one,'' Taliaferro
said. ``Everyone goes to stop Naeve, but they can't. He comes to
work, gets his kills, gets his blocks (four Wednesday), serves his
aces (zero) and goes home, and doesn't say anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell had plenty to say about Naeve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naeve's probably the best middle blocker in the country right
now,'' Campbell said. ``No one will stop him. It's just a matter of
stopping the other guys. He's that good.''
</P>
<P>
   There isn't much time for the Matadors to recover. Their next
match is Friday against LaVerne, which beat Northridge for the
first time in 19 meetings earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to focus on LaVerne,'' Campbell said. ``Sometimes you
have to take a step back to step forward.''

CALVIN KLEIN CANCELS ADS WITH CHILDREN AMID CRITICISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Calvin Klein decided on Wednesday to cancel an
advertising campaign for his new line of children's underwear after
heavy criticism from conservative groups, psychologists and the
mayor, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Klein Inc. had planned to unveil a huge billboard in
Times Square on Thursday _ in the middle of Fashion Week _ showing
two boys who appeared to be about 6, one clad only in jockey
shorts, the other in boxers, standing on a sofa and arm-wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   But after The New York Post published an article about the
advertisements on Wednesday, the designer apparently got an earful
from critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The comments and reaction that we have received today raised
issues that we had not fully considered,'' the company said in a
brief statement issued on Wednesday night. ``As a result, we have
decided to discontinue the campaign immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   A full-page version of the advertisement ran on page A5 of The
New York Times on Wednesday, and it is also in the March issue of
the magazine Martha Stewart Living. A two-page ad, featuring the
boys on one page and two little girls on another, will also appear
Sunday in The New York Times Magazine, which has already gone to
press.
</P>
<P>
   The big ad was to go up on the billboard outside the defunct
Times Square Theater, a state-owned building on the northwest
corner of Seventh Avenue and 42d Street that currently features an
ad for Calvin Klein underwear for adults.
</P>
<P>
   The new campaign for boys' and girls' underwear, developed by
the company's in-house agency, CRK Advertising, and shot by the
fashion photographer Mario Testino, ``was intended to show children
smiling, laughing and just being themselves,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to capture the same warmth and spontaneity that you
find in a family snapshot,'' the statement continued.
</P>
<P>
   But critics were unimpressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're in very bad taste,'' Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
said Wednesday before the company announced that it was pulling the
ads. ``But I can't stop them. I mean, there's the First
Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Donald E. Wildmon, the president of the American Family
Association in Tupelo, Miss., told The Associated Press that the
photo would appeal to pedophiles and was ``nothing more than
pornography.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the latest in a long string of Calvin Klein ad campaigns
that have drawn fire for what was perceived to be sexual content.
</P>
<P>
   Twice within three months in 1995, the company canceled ad
campaigns under barrages of criticism. One, for jeans, featured
teen-age models in poses and settings that critics said reeked of
cheap X-rated movies. The other showed men modeling underwear in
what some said appeared to be a state of arousal.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the company, Robert Triefus, declined to answer
questions on Wednesday night and deferred to the statement.

SOLEMN STARS UNHAPPY AFTER DEFEATING PANTHERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Times are tough at Reunion Arena when the Stars
outshoot an opponent 29-16, take a 2-1 victory and still have much
to complain about.
</P>
<P>
   That was the case last night as the Stars dispatched a scrappy
Florida Panthers team to stretch their current winning streak to
four games and still stood in a solemn dressing room afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times wins feel like losses around here,'' said Stars
center Mike Modano.
</P>
<P>
   Modano was one of the reasons for the glum feeling. The Stars'
top scorer had one of his worst performances of the season and
complained that he felt extremely tired. ``My legs had nothing in
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And while the second line of Joe Nieuwendyk, Pat Verbeek and
Jamie Langenbrunner picked up the slack and had a hand in two
third-period goals to break a scoreless tie, Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock was more concerned with the defensive lapses from his
second line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked that line, but it has to be stronger defensively,''
Hitchcock said. ``They had too many just-abouts out there where
they weren't in position.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the way of life when you're at the top of the NHL and
everyone is shooting at you. The Stars move to 34-10-8 with the
victory and are 7-1-1 since the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think either team played well. I guess we were
fortunate,'' said Stars captain Derian Hatcher, who scored the
game-winning goal on a power-play slap shot from 40 feet at the
9:29 mark of the third period.
</P>
<P>
   That goal proved critical when the Panthers (20-21-14) scored
with 3:46 remaining in the game and then sent a flurry of shots at
goalie Roman Turek (10-1-2) in hopes of tying the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had trouble protecting leads at home, and I don't know
why,'' Hitchcock said, citing his main reason for dissatisfaction
with his team's performance. ``We haven't had any trouble at all on
the road, but it's like we watch the clock at home. I'm concerned,
and I hope the players are concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe not as concerned as the coach would like.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard protecting leads,'' Hatcher said. ``But we protected
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe more of a concern is the fact Modano said he doesn't know
how he will recover from the fatigue while facing a stretch of four
games in six days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, I like to skate, I feel better \Rpracticing\S,''
he said. ``but maybe I need to ask for a day off.''
</P>
<P>
   Modano's bad game had an obvious effect on linemates Brett Hull
and Jere Lehtinen, and Hitchcock moved Modano off that line and
replaced him with Tony Hrkac for a brief stint to start the third
period.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when we probably got our biggest energy burst,''
Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Hrkac line didn't score, the surge in energy helped
the Stars, Hitchcock said. Minutes later, Langenbrunner drove to
the net to score his eighth goal and second in the past four games.
Less than four minutes after that, and Hatcher scored off a
Nieuwendyk feed and the Stars had the lead they needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have been better and we'll have to be better,''
Hatcher said. ``But it was a win.''

TROJANS' NIT HOPES FADING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With only four games left, USC is running out of
chances to compile enough victories for any hope of advancing to
the National Invitation Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Following their narrow 68-63 loss to UCLA on Wednesday night at
Pauley Pavilion, the Trojans dropped to 12-11 overall. They
probably will need at least 15 wins to be considered for the NIT.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a shot,'' said USC center Brian Scalabrine.
``We still believe we can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   About the only person who doesn't want to talk about USC's
postseason chances is coach Henry Bibby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't thought about that. I'm not thinking about that,''
Bibby said. ``We're shooting to build. To grow from game to game.
If we work hard, then we'll be where we want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans will probably have to sweep their final two homes
games next week against the Washington schools, and then split in
Arizona, if they harbor any postseason aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   Still on fire: Scalabrine, who had a game-high 22 points against
Stanford and hit the game's key shot with a 3-pointer in overtime,
didn't let up against UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Scalabrine made five of his first eight shots and had 14 points
in the first half against the Bruins. He finished with 20.
</P>
<P>
   One problem for the Trojans was that point guard Brandon
Granville did not duplicate his offensive effort against Stanford.
Granville, who had 21 points against the Cardinal, went scoreless
in the first half against UCLA, missed eight straight 3-point
attempts and finished with just two points.
</P>
<P>
   Granville was hurt in the final 30 seconds while falling hard to
the floor. Play was halted for several minutes, but Granville
returned to the game and appeared to be OK.
</P>
<P>
   Granville wasn't the only Trojan who cooled off. Sophomore Jeff
Trepagnier didn't take a shot in the first half and went scoreless,
following a 19-point scoring spree in the two Bay Area games.
</P>
<P>
   Trepagnier rebounded with eight points in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   No sympathy: Although UCLA forward Jerome Moiso (foot) did not
suit up, and reserves Sean Farnham and Brandon Loyd started because
of a lack of effort by other players against California, Bibby
wasn't empathizing with the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can never catch UCLA off. UCLA can use every ploy they
want,'' Bibby said. ``I don't care if their coming off a tough loss
or they're hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Confidence boost: Granville said the Trojans were not
intimidated playing UCLA at Pauley Pavilion, especially after
upsetting Stanford last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``That gives us confidence to show we are a good team and can
compete with the top teams in the nation,'' Granville said.
</P>
<P>
   Happy birthday: Sophomore forward Shannon Swillis got a present
on his 21st birthday Wednesday. After not playing in USC's previous
three games, Swillis was inserted with 19 seconds left in the first
half against UCLA. He got a steal and then closed out the
possession with a dunk, his first points since Jan. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby even played him briefly in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   His roommate, forward Jarvis Turner, got his first minutes since
Feb. 6 and had two points in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   One Trojan who didn't play was sophomore center Greg Lakey, his
first shutout in minutes since Jan. 4.

WALKER'S AGENT SAYS MAVERICKS DRAGGING FEET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The agent for Mavericks forward Samaki
Walker said yesterday that there has been no contact between him
and the Mavericks in 2 1/2 weeks in his bid to get a contract
extension for his client.
</P>
<P>
   Norm Nixon also said he doubts Walker will be signed by the
March 13 deadline to sign players who are in their third season in
the NBA, and that his client may wind up playing somewhere else
next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If \RWalker\S is supposed to be a big part of their
organization, why hasn't there been more contact?,'' Nixon asked.
``They haven't spoken to me but 10 minutes since this whole thing
started.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't seem like anyone feels an urgency to try to get a
deal done.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon said at least three teams have expressed an interest in
signing Walker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Samaki loves Dallas and wants to be there,'' Nixon said. `'But
he has to be ready to go play somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker said as of yesterday, he will no longer discuss his
contract situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to spend my energy and time worrying and talking
about it,'' Walker said. ``I just want to concentrate on playing
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks have offered Walker a four-year, $20 million
contract extension. He and Nixon have countered with two proposals
_ a four-year, $30 million deal and a six-year, $42 million
contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   Walker has until March 13 to sign with the Mavericks, or he'll
become a free agent on July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, Walker and Nixon had lunch together yesterday.
Nixon sat at a courtside seat at last night's game between the
Mavericks and Los Angeles Lakers, and clapped every time Walker did
something positive.
Movie preview
Mavericks guards Robert Pack and Steve Nash attended the private
screening for the movie ``Passing Glory'' on Tuesday night in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The TNT movie, scheduled to be aired on the cable channel at 7
p.m. CST Sunday, has Magic Johnson and Quincy Jones as two of its
executive producers. The movie depicts the racial tension that
existed at two New Orleans high schools, predominantly black St.
Augustine and predominantly white Jesuit.
</P>
<P>
   NBA players Avery Johnson, Kerry Kittles and Donald Royal
attended St. Augustine, and former Rangers first baseman Will Clark
attended Jesuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie brought back a lot of memories for me,'' said Pack,
who attended Lawless High School in New Orleans. ``As I was
watching it, they showed the projects and some of the places where
I used to hang out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a true story, and a real good movie.''
Harper happy
Los Angeles Lakers guard Derek Harper believes he now has his best
chance to win an NBA title since the 1993-94 season, when he was
with the New York Knicks and lost in the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a chance to win every night,'' Harper said. ``So
you've got to enjoy that.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper is in his first season with the Lakers. He previously
played for the Mavericks, Knicks and Orlando, and still makes his
off-season home in Carrollton.
Briefly
With Cedric Ceballos in the starting lineup last night for the
first time, the Mavericks have now used five starting lineups in
their eight games this season. The move was made because the
Mavericks are searching for an offensive spark to prevent them from
falling into a first-quarter hole.
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks coach/general manager Don Nelson was a guest on ESPN's
``Up Close''. The show was taped Tuesday and aired nationally
yesterday.

EPA PLANNING TOUGHER VEHICLE EMISSION RULES- 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency plans to propose to the
White House a crackdown on tailpipe pollution from cars and light
trucks along with tighter standards for the cleanliness of
gasoline, people who were told of the plans said on Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would drastically reduce pollution from so-called
light trucks, a category that includes sport utility vehicles,
pickup trucks and mini-vans. Until now, light trucks have been
allowed to produce up to three times as much pollution per mile
driven as cars, because regulators have regarded light trucks as
work vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   But with light trucks now accounting for nearly half the new
family vehicles sold, regulators have decided that light trucks
must start meeting the same rules as cars. ``They're being used in
a way that Congress, when it first passed the Clean Air Act, never
contemplated,'' an EPA official who insisted on anonymity said last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed rules that the EPA will soon send to the
White House for an interagency review, the allowable pollution for
cars would be cut by more than half by 2004, and light trucks would
be required to meet that standard by 2009. Allowable pollution by
some of the larger light trucks would have to be reduced by more
than 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While the broad outlines of rules on emissions and gasoline have
been known for several months, the final details have only been
settled this week, as the EPA prepares to send its plan to the
Office of Management and Budget.
</P>
<P>
   The last sticking point, resolved only in the last several days,
was whether full-sized sport-utility vehicles, like the Ford
Expedition, Dodge Durango and Chevrolet Tahoe would be required to
meet the car standard. The final compromise was that these large
vehicles, with large pickup trucks and a few large vans, would be
given until 2009 to comply, while smaller light trucks would have
to comply by 2007.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA also plans to require that oil companies remove almost
all of the sulphur in gasoline, reducing the concentration of the
contaminant to just 30 parts per million. Sulphur clogs the
surfaces of a car's catalytic converter, reducing its effectiveness
and dramatically increasing air pollution even from vehicles
equipped with the latest and most sophisticated emissions control
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the proposal were first reported in Thursday's
Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   The sulphur rules could add anywhere from a cent to several
cents to the price of a gallon of gasoline, studies have predicted.
The emissions rules could add hundreds of dollars to the cost of
making light trucks. Automakers have also warned that they might
have to make some light trucks less powerful, notably for towing,
to comply.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental agency plans to submit its proposal by next
Monday, which will start an interagency review. While the Clinton
administration's final stance on the issue is not yet clear, some
version of the proposal is likely to be issued as new regulations
in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown on sport-utility vehicles in particular represents
a big shift in thinking at the EPA, which until recently had been
reluctant to tighten rules on the popular and profitable vehicles.
``We don't want to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs for the
domestic industry,'' a senior EPA official said in in the fall of
1997.
</P>
<P>
   But rising sales of light trucks and growing awareness of their
pollution created pressure to act. The EPA was legally required to
draft new emissions rules to take effect in 2004.

SEASON'S FIRST PLATE RACE SHIFTS CUP LANDSCAPE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seven-time NASCAR Winston Cup champion Dale Earnhardt flat-out
hates restrictor-plate racing.
</P>
<P>
   Car owner Jack Roush says that if all NASCAR did was race with
carburetor-restrictor plates, he and Mark Martin would go fishing.
</P>
<P>
   At its best, two-time and reigning Daytona 500 champion Jeff
Gordon calls plate racing the great equalizer, which perhaps
explain the roll call of unfamiliar names in the first top-10
points chart after the Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 Winston Cup season opener ended with a classic 10-lap
shootout that saw Gordon _ the 1997 Daytona 500 winner _ edge 1998
race champion Earnhardt. Based upon preseason testing, Gordon's
pole-winning lap and Earnhardt's annual Twin 125-mile qualifying
race victory, that result played to form. Gordon and Earnhardt
stand 1-2 in points after the first of 34 races.
</P>
<P>
   But the top-10 chart is dotted with drivers who seldom whiff
that rarefied air. Kenny Irwin (third), Michael Waltrip (fifth) and
Kyle Petty (seventh in the race/eighth in points) combined for 11
top-10 finishes in 97 starts last year.
</P>
<P>
   Ninth and 10th Sunday, and in the points, are Chad Little and
Rick Mast. They combined to rack up more Did Not Finish results
(14) than top 10s (eight) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A Cup driver's success rate certainly is linked to his victory
total, as Gordon proved with his record-tying 13 checkered flags in
1998. But the NASCAR points system rewards consistency over the
34-race haul, the kind of grind-out-the-laps mentality that saw
Gordon record 28 top-10s en route to his third title in 1998.
Similarly, championship runner-up Mark Martin (seven victories)
bagged 26 top-10s and third-place Dale Jarrett (three victories)
notched 22.
</P>
<P>
   For fans weary of watching Gordon and The Usual Suspects run
away with race after race, the Daytona 500 provided a respite.
Aided by a 12-car wreck that eliminated Jarrett, Martin and
ever-consistent Terry Labonte, these drivers stepped up with the
plate:
</P>
<P>
   Irwin (third) scored the highest finish of his career for Robert
Yates Racing.
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip delivered a top five in his debut for team owner Jim
Mattei.
</P>
<P>
   Petty is halfway to matching his top-10 output of 1998 (two).
</P>
<P>
   Little upstaged high-profile Roush teammates Martin and Jeff
Burton.
</P>
<P>
   And Mast boosted morale for car owner Cale Yarborough and his
hastily re-assembled team.
</P>
<P>
   Rising star Mike Skinner (fourth), tough-luck Daytona 500
contender Rusty Wallace (sixth) and veteran Ken Schrader (seventh)
also occupy top-10 points slots as the series rolls into North
Carolina Speedway this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's results certainly were skewed by the great equalizer
that is the restrictor plate. As Jeremy Mayfield noted, ``Every
year you see guys who have a great Daytona 500, and then you
couldn't find them on a milk carton the rest of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield, relegated to a 20th-place finish by a cut tire,
expects to rebound into the top 10 along with Jarrett, Martin and
Labonte. But even if the current lineup fails to last, it still is
a welcome breath of restricted air.
SPOTLIGHT ON...
Winless Michael Waltrip knows the drill, accepts it
</P>
<P>
   It has gotten to the point that, after 395 NASCAR Winston Cup
starts, the question has become ``de rigueur'' in any interview
with Michael Waltrip.
</P>
<P>
   How does it feel to never have won a Cup race?
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter now many times it's asked, somebody hasn't asked
it,'' said Waltrip, who has more starts without a victory than any
other current Cup driver. ``It's part of it. You can look at it as
a hassle or you can look at it as part of the responsibility. You
\Rmedia\S folks have got a job to do, got questions to ask. I'm OK
with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip finished fifth in the Daytona 500 in his debut for car
owner Jim Mattei. The euphoria was short-lived. On Tuesday, Waltrip
and crew chief Bobby Kennedy were busy sorting out spring and shock
combinations in Greenville, S.C., in preparation for the
Dura-Lube/Big Kmart 400 at North Carolina Speedway this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind Sunday's race is only the second of 34 on the
schedule, then check out Waltrip's mind-set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started this season thinking this could be my last season,''
said Waltrip, driver of the No. 7 Philips Chevrolet Monte Carlo.
``I've got a great ride, a great team, a great sponsor. If I don't
run well I might not get a ride next year. So it's worth listening
to everybody reminding me I never won a race. ... I'll never feel
like I'm accepted until I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip did win The Winston, the series' all-star race, while
driving for the Wood Brothers in 1996. But no points are awarded
for The Winston, and Waltrip remains 0-forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started with the Wood Brothers in 1996, I felt we
could do good,'' said Waltrip, 35, whose lone second-place finish
was recorded for car-owner Chuck Rider in 1988. ``We won The
Winston and were really competitive, and, for some reason, we let
it slip away. But I'm back up, and I feel with this organization we
can do it. It's an exciting feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the confidence I need to win. It's just putting the
people together. I'm trying to have a relationship with my crew
chief and car owner where we all think alike. That's our goal.
That, I think, is the key to getting into Victory Lane. There's no
tricks to this business. It's just hard work.''
QUICK HITS A RATINGS WINNER
</P>
<P>
   CBS' broadcast of the Daytona 500 captured the Fort Worth/Dallas
television war on Sunday, outdrawing the NBA, NHL and college
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gordon's run to Victory Lane posted a 6.0 Nielsen rating/16
share locally. The Buick Open, won by Tiger Woods, enjoyed a 6.4
rating/14 share and was not nearly as loud.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Daytona 500 and the Buick Open pretty much tied on the
ratings points, but Daytona had a much higher share of the
viewers,'' said Max Robinson, national sales manager for CBS
affiliate KTVT/Channel 11. Share is the percentage of TV households
in use in the area that are tuned to a program. Rating is the
percent of all TV households watching in the area.
</P>
<P>
   A Nielsen-estimated national viewership of 29.5 million tuned in
to the race, up 13 percent from last year's 26.2 million viewers.
GORDON COOL TO F1'S LURE
</P>
<P>
   Former three-time Formula One champion Jackie Stewart of
Scotland says Jeff Gordon would be a welcome addition to the series
for the inaugural United States Grand Prix at the Indianapolis
Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's clearly an enormously talented driver,'' said Stewart, an
F1 team owner who toured construction under way at IMS on Tuesday
in preparation for the return of the U.S. Grand Prix in 2000.
``Unfortunately, Jeff Gordon is making so much money now in his own
little area that it would be difficult for him to see the logic of
leaving that guaranteed marketplace and going into Formula One
racing.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, a three-time NASCAR Winston Cup champion who began his
career in open-wheeled cars, said Monday that he remains
``fascinated'' by F1's technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a lot of interesting offers and talked about a lot of
things, but I've never taken them serious,'' said Gordon, a
two-time winner of NASCAR's Brickyard 400 at IMS. ``NASCAR Winston
Cup is where it's at.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon added that if the opportunity arose to drive an F1 car _
just for grins _ ``You'd better bet that I'd jump on it.''
INDY 500 ENTRIES MAILED
</P>
<P>
   Entry invitations are in the mail for the 83rd Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   Forms were mailed Tuesday to teams eligible to compete in the
May 30 event. Entry deadline is April 9.
</P>
<P>
   The most anticipated returned form is from Treadway Racing,
which is expected to field two-time Indy 500 champion Arie
Luyendyk. The Dutchman plans to retire after the big race.
</P>
<P>
   Opening day at the 2.5-mile oval is May 15, with Pole Day
qualifications scheduled for May 22. As was the case last year,
qualifications will conclude with a second session May 23.
LAST WORDS
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the same thing as winning for us. That's about as good
as I've ever run in the 500.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Kyle Petty, after his seventh-place finish in NASCAR's Daytona
500

LAKERS FLEX THEIR MUSCLES AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ What the Lakers needed most after a sluggish,
criticism-inspiring, speculation-creating 3-3 start to the season
was a blowout. Now they have two straight, and all the pesky
questions and doubts suddenly seem a little less pressing.
</P>
<P>
   The cure for all ills Wednesday night was the Dallas Mavericks,
who kindly rolled over for a 101-88 rout before 13,492 at the
Forum. Combined with Tuesday's 28-point drubbing of Charlotte, the
victory provided the Lakers a second straight night of renewed
confidence _ and a bit of momentum heading into the next grueling
stretch of the compact season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess temporarily it's cool,'' Derek Fisher had said
earlier. ``We still have a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Their winning ways will be put to the test immediately, with
eight games in 11 days, starting Friday when San Antonio comes to
the Forum. Included in the run is the Lakers' first
three-games-in-three-nights experience _ Sunday, Monday and
Tuesday, at Seattle, Denver and Vancouver. They then return to L.A.
for a pair of games with the Clippers, a home game against Houston
and a road trip to Phoenix to end the 11-day grind.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's rout was as automatic as a Shaquille O'Neal dunk and
a Kobe Bryant baseline drive. The Lakers' new one-two punch
combined for 30 of the Lakers' first-half points as they took a
53-37 lead that was never threatened.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal finished with a game-high 24 points in 28 minutes of
work, and Bryant scored 23. Eddie Jones chipped in 20, and the
much-maligned Fisher posted a season-high 12 points to go with five
rebounds and six assists.
</P>
<P>
   For Fisher, there was some redemption. Though he's the starting
point guard, Fisher's been giving up the majority of minutes to
Derek Harper, particularly late in games, and has struggled with
the ambiguity of his role.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Trent led the Mavericks with 15 points off the bench, and
Michael Finley added 12.
</P>
<P>
   Like most recent meetings between the two teams, this one was
over by halftime, the Lakers leading by 16.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal's 18 first-half points represented more output than
Dallas' entire starting five could muster _ Dirk Nowitzki, Cedric
Ceballos, A.C. Green, Michael Finley and Steve Nash combined for
16, and the Mavericks shot 36.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers outrebounded the Mavericks 30-20 in the half, shot an
even 50 percent, and Bryant also reached double figures in scoring,
with 12. Jones had nine.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, the Lakers picked up where they left off the night
before in their rout of the Charlotte Hornets. Like Charlotte,
Dallas also came to the Forum with just one win to its credit, and
played like it.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers had an 18-10 lead seven minutes into the game, with
all the points provided by the Big Three of O'Neal, Jones and
Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   By early in the second quarter, Dallas had cut the deficit to
26-22, but the proximity was short-lived. Bryant scored eight
points in just over two minutes to push the lead to 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks made it to within six again, but that was it for
the night. An 11-0 Lakers run, punctuated by a fast-break jam by
Jones, pushed the lead to 17, and the suspense was pretty much
gone.

KANSAS TAKES A TUMBLE IN STATURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kansas coach Roy Williams has experienced a winter of discontent
as the mighty Jayhawks have fallen into the category of mere
college basketball mortals.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas entered last night's game against Kansas State at 16-8
overall and 8-4 in the Big 12, trailing Texas, Oklahoma, Missouri
and Nebraska in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching mortal status wasn't easy. Junior forward Paul Pierce
left for the NBA. Soaring glass cleaner Lester Earl has been
grounded by sore knees. Transfer power forward Ashante Johnson tore
up a knee before the season began. Don't forget that Raef LaFrentz
and Billy Thomas, the most prolific 3-point shooter in school
history, were seniors last season.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa ended the Jayhawks' 62-game winning streak in Allen
Fieldhouse. Kansas lost consecutive games for the first time in 165
tipoffs. The Jayhawks fell from The Associated Press rankings for
the first time in 144 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's been all that laundry to do.
</P>
<P>
   Huh?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done five loads of wash the last two weeks,'' Williams
said with some pride. ``I'm getting good at it. Maybe if I ever get
fired I can get a job as a cleaning person.''
</P>
<P>
   As if Williams' didn't have enough to contend with, his wife,
Wanda, slipped on a patch of ice two weeks ago and broke the large
bone in her upper left arm where it fits into the shoulder socket.
So one of America's most distinguished basketball coaches has dealt
with a slew of heretofore unfamiliar household chores on top of
dealing with daily analysis of college basketball's winningest
program of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately,'' Williams said, ``we've had help from so many
friends that so far Wanda hasn't had to eat any of my cooking.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Williams' team has had to eat some crow as Kansas has
stumbled to as many as eight losses for only the third time in
Williams' 11 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been an interesting year,'' said senior guard Ryan
Robertson, who has played on three previous teams with a combined
98-11 record. ``We've had some really great moments and some
moments that make you scratch your head. It's interesting to see
how people react.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny when you think about some of the things we've done.
You look at our record, our position, and there's still an outside
shot we could pull off the conference championship. We are very
probable for the NCAA Tournament, and there are a lot of people
around here who can't believe we've lost a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``But at the same time, these type programs attract those type
expectations year in and year out.''
</P>
<P>
   They also attract players like freshman point guard Jeff
Boschee, one of the Big 12's top newcomers and likely a key player
in Kansas' future.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they announce your name at Allen Fieldhouse and the crowd
goes nuts, it still sends chills up and down my spine,'' Boschee
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I was listening to the radio the other night to what some
people are saying about us. A lot of them were bashing us, saying
we're not going to do anything in the tournament. People have their
doubts about us. It's the same with every big-time team when
they're losing. Everybody loves a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas may not return to its domination of the Big 12 for yet
another year, but the program is far from dire straits. Robertson
is the lone senior. Texas transfer Luke Axtell becomes eligible
next season. And Williams signed three players in November who many
rank as the best class he has recruited.
</P>
<P>
   Williams says he's very encouraged about the future of the
program, but refuses to look that far ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very strongly that I can't just think about the
future,'' Williams said. ``That would be like cheating the kids we
have now. If I were to totally think about that, I'd be a sorry
individual, and I like to think I'm not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am getting a lot more suggestions this year than in the
past. But we're working just as hard _ no more, no less. We feel
very comfortable with our philosophy. ... Yet, we've got to
understand that sometimes you have to give the other team credit.
And that's the hardest thing for our fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he agonizes that this team has had to be a part of
things like seeing the end to the winning streaks. But he admits
the season has been hard on him, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been the toughest year I've had in coaching,'' he said.
``And that includes our first year \R1988-89\S when we were dealing
with the probation and just trying to piecemeal things together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that I was ready for it. Yet I'm glad I wasn't,
because I don't like it. And I'm not comfortable with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorting the wash into colors and whites has been easier to
adjust to.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRAN BLINEBURY  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
MINNEAPOLIS _ It was an anniversary of sorts. Exactly seven years
to the night since a ragtag collection of frisky Timberpuppies came
from 24 points down midway through the third quarter in Houston to
defeat the Rockets in overtime.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A notable occasion not just for the height of the swan dive or
the magnitude of the crash, but because it marked the end of a
tenure and the beginning of an era.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, gentlemanly Don Chaney was fired and Rudy
Tomjanovich became the Rockets' reluctant head coach, and all the
rest, as they say, is history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some change, huh?'' Rudy T said through a pained laugh after
watching the now-grown-up Timberwolves gnaw on his Rockets 116-102
on Wednesday night. ``Times like this, it seems like a lot longer
than seven years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets could have played till dawn and never come up with
an answer for Stephon Marbury, who sliced through the lane, cruised
on the baseline and stuck jumpers like pins into a voodoo doll for
a career-high 40 points. The Timberwolves wore down the Rockets,
gobbling up offensive rebounds in the second half and dominating
play on the inside.
</P>
<P>
   Fatigue, quite obviously, was a factor for the Rockets, who now
move on to face the Nets in the swamps of New Jersey to close out a
grueling stretch of three games in three nights before tackling a
torturous weekend in Florida against Miami and Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   ``O-o-o-o-o-o-o-h!'' said Tomjanovich. ``I have no idea what you
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Except that you know somehow, some way, he will find something
to do to keep the leaky ship afloat until the walking wounded of
Charles Barkley, Stanley Roberts, Antoine Carr and Rodrick Rhodes
can make it back onto the court to give the Rockets the roster they
believe can contend for the NBA title.
</P>
<P>
   It's what Rudy T does best _ he survives, even thrives, when the
outlook is the bleakest and the odds are the longest. Which is why
his jewelry drawer at home already holds a pair of championship
rings from 1994 and 1995 and why the powers that be of USA
Basketball will name him today as the head coach of the American
team for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   It is, in part, a reward for the job Tomjanovich did last summer
in Athens, Greece, when the NBA labor lockout pulled the rug out
from under him at the last minute and forced him to lead a team of
CBA lifers and European-league castoffs into the World
Championships. Barely given a chance to survive the first round of
the tournament, the underdogs won the bronze medal, and Rudy T won
the respect of the international community.
</P>
<P>
   It is also recognition that in the seven years since he was
practically shoved into the spotlight role by his buddy Carroll
Dawson, Tomjanovich has made himself into one of the best in his
profession, while also transforming the Rockets into one of the
NBA's elite franchises, a magnet that now attracts upper-echelon
players.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley wanted to come to Houston to play for Rudy T, and he was
willing to sign this season for the minimum salary to stay with
Rudy T. Scottie Pippen singled out Tomjanovich and the atmosphere
he has created as one of his major attractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I'm most proud of,'' Rudy T said. ``That we have
built our team and organization into one where players want to come
and be a part of it. I never thought about coaching when I was a
player. But I always did know how I felt at various points in my
career based on the way I was treated by different people. I never
wanted to make any of the same mistakes. I never want my players to
feel like they have anything less than my total support.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it is down 3-1 to Phoenix without the home-court
advantage in a best-of-seven playoff series or playing through an
injury-plagued season like a year ago when the Rockets struggled to
finish 41-41 and limped into the playoffs against Utah, his belief
in his players never wavers and any concern or criticism of them
will never be made public.
</P>
<P>
   There is a reason why Marbury walked out of the layup line just
before this game and said to Rockets trainer Keith Jones, ``I still
haven't signed that new ($70 million) deal yet.''
</P>
<P>
   They want to come to Houston. They want to play for him.
</P>
<P>
   Hakeem Olajuwon and Pippen respect him. Barkley genuinely likes
him. Othella Harrington wanted to go nowhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Michael Dickerson, a Rocket for barely a month, gives
credit to Rudy T for sticking by him through his early shooting
woes and now is on an offensive tear.
</P>
<P>
   Nights like this one against the Timberwolves seem so long, and
yet seven years go by in a flash. With a winning percentage of .618
with two titles, he is second only to Utah's Jerry Sloan in being
on the job with the same team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never wanted to do this for life,'' Tomjanovich said. ``But
I feel good, my nervous system is better and I've learned how to
deal with the ups and downs of the league without going crazy. It's
funny after the way it started. I like this job.''
</P>
<P>
   And it shows, shining like Olympic gold.

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
MINNEAPOLIS _ The problem, Stephon Marbury decided, was that the
Timberwolves had just been too ``professional.'' They needed, he
said, to play ``like thugs.'' Either that, or like John Stockton
and Karl Malone.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some might question the difference between Utah's Stockton and
Malone and Marbury's notion of thugs. But the Rockets were not
ready for either Wednesday night. When the Timberwolves got going
in the second half, it seemed that only a stay of execution from
Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, seated in the front row, could save
them. Such a reprieve did not come, as the Timberwolves ran away
for a 116-102 win at the Target Center.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury had a career-high 40 points and still found time for 12
assists and four rebounds. Kevin Garnett, playing the role of
Malone, chased a triple double, totaling 23 points, nine rebounds
and nine assists.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets, playing the second of three games in three days,
were able to keep pace for a while but did not have near the
reserve necessary to stop the Timberwolves' roll once it got going.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of that going around,'' Rockets coach Rudy
Tomjanovich said of the perils of the NBA's sprint of a season.
``We hung in there for a while. Defense has been our foundation so
far, but for a great part of the game we couldn't get them stopped.
When they missed, they got the offensive rebound and put it back
in. But they didn't miss many.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be tempting to say the Rockets hit the back-to-back
wall and collapsed. But when Marbury did his human-blur thing,
Garnett glided impossibly high above the court, or just about any
gunner the Timberwolves put on the court could not miss, the
Rockets' fatigue did not seem the issue in the snapping of their
five-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought me and Kevin worked really well,'' Marbury said.
``We looked like Stockton and Malone on the pick-and-rolls.''
</P>
<P>
   Marbury was especially unstoppable, making 16 of 24 shots,
including eight of 11 in the second half. The Timberwolves ran him
through everything, from a series of pick-and-rolls to clearouts.
He pulled up on breaks and went one-on-one. The Rockets tried Matt
Maloney, Brent Price, Cuttino Mobley and Michael Dickerson on the
precocious point guard, and none had any lasting success.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have time to prepare for him,'' Mobley said.
``Steph's a great point guard, don't get me wrong. But if you give
him the easy shots in the beginning, he's hard to stop at the
end.''
</P>
<P>
   Marbury, however, had made only 39.3 percent of his shots this
season coming in. He had been averaging just 13.3 points per game,
his previous high a relatively calm 21.
</P>
<P>
   But with his brother Don, a former Texas A&AMP;M player, on hand,
Marbury was determined to come out of his shell.
</P>
<P>
   ``He flew in today,'' Marbury said, ``and was like, `What's
wrong, man? You ain't playing (like) yourself. You worked so hard
in the summer. You did all that shooting every day. You're not
shooting with confidence.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to run the team, make sure everybody comes out
and plays aggressive and runs all the right plays, to do everything
perfect. (Anthony Peeler) says not to play like professionals, to
play like thugs. Thugs play harder.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets could not match that. Othella Harrington scored 23
points for them, making seven of 14 shots, but had just seven
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Hakeem Olajuwon scored just 14 points, consistently drawing
fouls inside but failing to make the Timberwolves pay, making just
four of eight free throws.
</P>
<P>
   And when the Timberwolves turned the game into a shapeless
scramble, Scottie Pippen could not control it as he had Tuesday's
17-point win over the Suns. Pippen (12 points, four assists) took
seven shots total and just two in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   So clearly drained were the Rockets that they had just three
second-half rebounds. And their 61 field-goal attempts were the
fourth-fewest in club history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play smart,'' Pippen said, discounting the effect of
fatigue. ``We didn't handle the ball well. We should have tried to
control the tempo. When you don't control the tempo on the road,
this is the result we get.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Rockets might have made a move to begin the fourth
quarter, drawing fouls almost every time down the court and
reducing a 13-point hole to a more manageable nine.
</P>
<P>
   But they never could stop the Timberwolves or even do much to
step in their path. With the exception of a rushed miss to beat the
third-quarter buzzer, Minnesota scored on 17 consecutive trips down
the court. While the Rockets made an occasional free throw, the
Timberwolves were infallible.
</P>
<P>
   From a 58-58 tie, the Timberwolves had an 18-5 run to a 76-63
lead. In that five-minute stretch, they made nine of 12 shots,
getting a follow on each of the misses, while the Rockets had just
one field goal, three turnovers and three missed free throws. And
if the Rockets barely had the strength to keep pace until then,
there was little left to mount a fourth-quarter rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always tough back-to-back against a young, energetic,
athletic team,'' Price said. ``We had a really good first half.
Stephon had a great game, and they got the big fella (Garnett)
going. It's tough. We kind of got out of our game plan, and they
got rolling. They just fed off each other.''

DAVIS POINTS THE WAY FOR UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC had the smarts, the shooters and the savvy to
conjure its second upset in five days, but the Trojans didn't have
the legs, and they did not have Baron Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Ferocious offensive rebounding and a 16-foot jumper by Davis
were enough to push the Bruins past USC 68-63 Wednesday night at
Pauley Pavilion in a taut, entertaining game.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins trailed 54-50 with eight minutes left when their
defense began to slowly smother USC. Relentless offensive
rebounding by JaRon Rush (10 rebounds) and Earl Watson _ and the
ensuing free throws _ gave the Bruins a 65-61 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The margin was 65-63 when Davis converted a spinning, fade-away
jumper with 36 seconds left that secured the victory _ UCLA's 10th
consecutive in the city series.
</P>
<P>
   The win also ended UCLA's two-game losing streak and marked a
return of the energy that evaporated last weekend in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the last two seasons have been a roller coaster off
the court,'' UCLA forward Sean Farnham said. ``On the floor, it
seems we're struggling now. What we need to do is find a way to get
all 13 guys competing at the highest level until we reach our
potential.''
</P>
<P>
   No one was more frustrated with UCLA's performance at Cal than
Davis, who singlehandedly kept the Bruins breathing with a
career-high 27 points. Afterward, Davis ripped his teammates and
vowed to improve UCLA's attitude in practice, even if it meant
stepping on fragile egos.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday afternoon, he pronounced the situation solved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen some intensity and passion, and we needed that
back,'' he said. ``Everybody practiced except Jerome (Moiso), and
had two good quality practices.''
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the Bruins used an unconventional starting lineup
Wednesday, with senior Brandon Loyd and Farnham joining Watson,
Rush and Davis. Walk-on Todd Ramasar was the sixth man. Moiso did
not play because of tendinitis in his right foot.
</P>
<P>
   Loyd, for one, was thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is the message that's sent,'' he said. ``I'm
excited to get a chance. It'll be fun to start, but my overall goal
is for the team. It's a great lesson to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Fresh off its stunning upset of Stanford, USC used a standard
starting lineup, which meant the rejuvenated Brian Scalabrine at
center. He scored 22 points at Stanford and continued that pace in
Pauley, hitting several early jumpers and keeping USC close with 14
points in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's reserves-cum-starters held their own until the regulars
returned. Farnham was the most effective, and after an early exit
he returned to help contain Scalabrine. Eventually, though, it was
reserve forward Matt Barnes who did the best job, holding
Scalabrine to six points in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Bruins led for most of the first half, it was a
tenuous advantage. Each time they seemed poised to grab control,
the Trojans responded with a big basket _ either a 3-pointer or a
Scalabrine jumper. After Watson's third foul with 3:41 left in the
half, the Bruins bolted to their largest lead, 32-25, when Davis
found Farnham for a lay-up.
</P>
<P>
   But with Watson and Davis on the bench in the final minute, UCLA
committed three turnovers in four possessions. Shannon Swillis'
dunk trimmed USC's halftime deficit to 34-31.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans maintained that momentum when the second half began.
Scalabrine connected from the right wing, then hit a mid-range
fade, and suddenly USC was within a basket. The Trojans took their
first lead since 7-6 when Sam Clancy scored with 15 minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' biggest problem _ Scalabrine aside _ was poor
continuity on offense. They did not react well to USC's changing
defenses, and Davis committed several turnovers trying to force the
ball into traffic.
</P>
<P>
   When the Bruins did execute, they failed to convert from the
foul line. Barnes' missed free throws translated into an Elias
Ayuso jumper and a 51-47 USC lead with just over 10 minutes
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA tightened its defense in the late stages and held the
Trojans to one basket in a five-possession span. But the Bruins
missed five free throws and held a meager 64-61 with 2:18 left.
Watson increased the lead to 65-61 a minute later, capping a
three-shot possession with one free throw.

DUCKS SLUGGISH IN 6-2 LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ When it comes to the .500 mark, the Mighty Ducks are
getting into the habit of firing and falling back.
</P>
<P>
   With a chance to move a game above .500 and open a seven-point
advantage on eighth-place Edmonton, the fifth-place Ducks were just
the tonic the struggling Oilers needed in a 6-2 victory over
Anaheim at the Pond on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   A sluggish power play, turnovers and a miserable third period
were enough to drive the majority of the crowd of 14,540 home
early.
</P>
<P>
   They also were enough to once again drop the Ducks, who had won
six of their seven previous games, one game under .500 (23-24-9).
Anaheim has reached the .500 mark nine times this season only to
fall back each time.
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers broke open a 2-1 game in the third period when they
scored four consecutive goals (three by Alexander Selivanov) in
just over three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   A helpless Guy Hebert gave up Edmonton's first five goals,
before he was mercifully replaced midway through the third period .
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks' feeble response was Steve Rucchin's 21st goal of the
year after the Oilers had taken a 6-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks were outshot (10-8) and outscored (1-0) in the first
period despite controlling much of the play.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim failed to score during its 5:28 of power play time and
it gave up a shorthanded goal to Mats Lindgren to make things
worse.
</P>
<P>
   Ranked fourth in the league on the power play, the Ducks
struggled to control the puck in the Edmonton zone and managed but
one shot with the man advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers were unable to generate any pressure at even
strength, but they took the lead at 16:49 when Lindgren knocked in
a rebound of Rem Murray's backhander after the Ducks lost control
of the puck at the Edmonton blue line.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks did have several great chances to score earlier in the
period, but Mikhail Shtalenkov was more than up to the task.
</P>
<P>
   The former Duck turned aside Paul Kariya on a shorthanded
breakaway, Teemu Selanne on a partial break, Ted Drury's one-timer
from the right circle and Fredrik Olausson's long shot through a
screen in the final minute of the period.
</P>
<P>
   The power play did break through 26 seconds into the second
period when Selanne knocked in a rebound of Olausson's shot from
the right point for his 27th goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But a little over four minutes later the Ducks' No. 1 line
struggled to get the puck out of their zone. It eventually turned
the puck over and gave up a two-on-one break that the Oilers' Mike
Greer converted with a rebound shot from the slot.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonton had a great chance to take a two-goal lead when it had
a 50-second two-man advantage. The Oilers, however, managed but one
shot _ a 15-footer from the slot by Bill Guerin that Hebert turned
aside.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks' best chance to score came near the end of their two
consecutive penalties when Rucchin broke in alone from the blue
line. He was pulled down from behind, but referee Stephen Walkom
did not call a penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it would have mattered. When the Ducks did get another
power-play chance they generated zero shots. &UR; !dlim!!end! &LR;  &QL;

LAKERS LOOK AHEAD AFTER ROUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ What the Lakers needed most after a sluggish,
criticism-inspiring, speculation-creating 3-3 start to the season
was a blowout. Now they have two straight, and all the pesky
questions and doubts suddenly seem a little less pressing.
</P>
<P>
   The cure for all ills Wednesday night was the Dallas Mavericks,
who kindly rolled over for a 101-88 rout before 13,492 at the
Forum. Combined with Tuesday's 28-point drubbing of Charlotte, the
victory provided the Lakers a second straight night of renewed
confidence _ and a bit of momentum heading into the next grueling
stretch of this compact season.
</P>
<P>
   But after the ups and downs of the season so far, no one was
exactly busting out champagne bottles over a pair of easy wins, but
rather looking ahead to the next challenge _ the Spurs arrive
Friday to start a stretch of eight games in 11 nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think every individual on our team, we have to have a
realistic view,'' said Eddie Jones, ``mainly because the team
that's coming in here Friday is San Antonio, and we know they're
capable of doing a lot of good things. We have to be a team where
we see what's in front of us.... It's good that we won those two
games so that we have a little confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no shortage of that quality Wednesday night, as the
Lakers cruised to a 16-point lead by halftime and extended it to 25
early in fourth quarter. Overconfidence, suddenly, was the problem.
</P>
<P>
   With mostly reserves on the floor, the Lakers watched Dallas
mount a 19-6 run, slicing the lead to 96-84 with 3:15 to go. That
forced coach Del Harris to send Kobe Bryant and Rick Fox back in
the game to prevent a catastrophic collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did some good things for three quarters,'' Harris said,
``then we kind of played fat-cat ball the last quarter.... We
didn't play real basketball for the fourth quarter. That happens
sometimes with a 25-point lead, but you never like to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially when the coach is trying to use the final 12 minutes
as nap time for his starters. And they certainly need the rest for
the upcoming stretch of of the schedule. After San Antonio on
Friday, the Lakers face their first three-games-in-three-nights
experience, all on the road, at Seattle, Denver and Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   So it was certainly a priority to have Shaquille O'Neal, Jones
and Bryant on the bench late in the game. All had earned the
respite, scoring 24, 23 and 20 points, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   However, the most encouraging line of the night belong to Derek
Fisher, who posted a season-high 12 points to go with six assists
and five rebounds. The Lakers' starting point had battled criticism
and his own confidence in struggling through the first two weeks of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   And he put all of his worst tendencies on display to start
Wednesday's game, with three turnovers in the first three minutes.
Harris yanked Fisher in favor of Derek Harper, but when Fisher
returned, he was aggressive and effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the way I started tonight, I figured it couldn't really
get any worse than that,'' Fisher said. ``So I just went out there
and let it all hang out.''
</P>
<P>
   He took the early benching, he said, ``for what it was,'' then
thanked Harris for sending him back out to earn some redemption.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just sensed that I played as if I was in the third grade and
I was playing with a bunch of men,'' Fisher said. ``I really just
had to tell myself that I belong here. I'm confident enough in my
ability to just go out and let it all hang out.''

BC WAY OFF MARK AGAINST HOYAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A chance was all they really wanted. And that's
precisely what the players on the Boston College men's basketball
team had with two seconds left. One last chance.
</P>
<P>
   But the Eagles failed to capitalize when they failed to get off
a potential game-tying shot in Wednesday night's 57-54 Big East
loss to Georgetown before 8,399 at the MCI Center.
</P>
<P>
   Georgetown's Daymond Jackson, who gave BC its last possession
when he stepped out of bounds trying to chase down Trez
Fitzpat-rick's long inbounds pass, atoned by tipping away Dwayne
Pina's inbounds lob intended for Willie Deane to pin the Eagles
(6-17, 3-12 Big East) with their third straight conference loss.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that BC was within striking distance was, in the words
of sophomore guard Kenny Harley, ``a little mind-boggling.'' After
all, the Eagles shot a dreadful 26.7 percent from the field (8 of
30) in the second half, missing 18 consecutive shots, and, worst of
all, were missing one of their leading scorers and ballhandlers in
junior forward Michael Cotton, who sprained his left ankle late in
the first half and sat out the remainder of the game. Cotton may
not play Saturday, when BC hosts Pittsburgh at noon.
</P>
<P>
   And yet for all those shortcomings, the Eagles were still alive
when they emerged from a huddle after diagramming their last
inbounds play, which was designed to create a logjam in the middle
and free up a cutter deep in the backcourt for a 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we came out, I looked up (at the scoreboard) and thought,
`Hey, we've got a shot,''' said Harley, who led the Eagles by tying
a career high with 19 points on 7-for-17 shooting, including a
3-pointer with two seconds left that drew BC within 3 (57-54). ``I
thought we were going to get one of those miracle plays and send it
into overtime. If we had sent it to overtime, I think we might have
won it because we would've had all the momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles squandered any momentum they had built in taking a
30-24 halftime lead by lapsing into a dreadful 11-minute-7-second
stretch in which they missed 18 consecutive shots. Kenny Walls, who
had 12 points and a career-high nine rebounds, finally snapped the
skein with a fast-break dunk that pulled BC within 7 (42-35) with
8:18 to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, I can't say it nearly enough, these guys just
continue to fight and battle back,'' said BC coach Al Skinner.
``But we can't afford to lose anyone, and when Cotton went down, it
hurt us.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Braswell and Nat Burton also proved to be pains for the
Eagles by leading the Hoyas (13-12, 5-10) with 14 points apiece.
Ruben Boumtje-Boumtje, who gave Georgetown the lead for good,
34-33, on a jump hook with 15:47 to go, chipped in 10 points, 13
rebounds, and 6 blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
   Still, BC nearly pulled it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the tapes I've watched of them, they are a very scrappy
team,'' said Georgetown coach Craig Esherick, who assumed the reins
when John Thompson stepped down Jan. 8. ``I was hoping that it
wouldn't be that close at the end, but I knew it was going to be a
tough game for us.''

UMASS CAN'T DIG OUT OF HOLE AGAINST GW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As they walked up the corridor steps, they engaged
in an energetic, hand-clapping, finger-popping chant that would
have impressed the best a cappella groups.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Massachusetts men's basketball team entered
Wednesday night's Atlantic 10 contest against George Washington
with loads of enthusiasm; the players were so noisy in the corridor
they didn't hear the national anthem being sung on the court, and
when officials silenced them, backup center Anthony Oates fired
back, ``You're disrupting our flow.''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed as if beleagured UMass was eager to make a statement
against one of the A-10's top teams.
</P>
<P>
   Then the game began.
</P>
<P>
   Starting center Lari Ketner picked up his first foul seven
seconds into the contest. UMass' first 12 possessions produced just
3 points, along with four turnovers. It took the Minutemen 9:28 to
reach the 10-point mark.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the enthusiasm was gone, replaced by a somber state
that has typified many UMass games this season. After trailing by
14 points at halftime and 15 in the second half, the Minutemen
recaptured enough of a spark to stage several rallies. But the
subpar start was too much to overcome. GW sank its free throws down
the stretch after UMass cut the deficit to 5 and held on for a
hard-fought 78-72 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Lari got that foul and it just started escalating from
there,'' said forward Chris Kirkland (26 points, 12 rebounds, both
career highs), who led a UMass charge that outscored GW, 67-54,
over the last 32 minutes. ``We lost our composure. We were up there
bouncing around before the game and then when things went wrong
guys put their heads down.''
</P>
<P>
   Monty Mack had 24 points and several UMass reserves played
solidly. But coach Bruiser Flint benched senior starters Ketner (no
first-half points) and Charlton Clarke over the last 15 minutes.
``Some guys came to play and some didn't,'' Flint said.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was the Minutemen's third in five games. It left them
11-14 overall, 7-6 in league play. A team that was one of the most
prolific in the 1990s must now win its last three games (against
Xavier, La Salle, and Temple) to avoid its first losing regular
season of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a tough season and now we have to find out who wants
to finish out, who isn't quitting,'' said Flint.
</P>
<P>
   GW (17-6, 11-2) was led by Mike King (22 points), Yegor
Mescheriakov (20 points, 12 boards), and Shawnta Rogers (15 points,
6 assists).

<P>
   BOSTON _ Wednesday night's crowd at Conte Forum was rather
quiet, which could have been a bad thing. But instead, it was a
good thing. A very good thing, as the Boston College fans watched
the women's basketball team pick apart Villanova.
</P>
<P>
   But with a minute to go in the game, the hoots and hollers from
the 2,137 in attendance began. This was no time to be docile, no
time to be polite.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles, who led virtually from start to finish, soundly
defeated Villanova, 65-39, improving to 19-6 overall and 11-6 in
the Big East, good for fourth place in the conference. Villanova
dropped to 12-12, 8-8.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman forward Becky Gottstein, who leads the team in field
goal percentage (56.4), led the Eagles with 16 points (on 7-for-12
shooting) and eight rebounds. Forward Alissa Murphy added 13 points
and center Jamie Cournoyer had 10.
</P>
<P>
   No Wildcats broke double digits, as sophomore guard Lauren
Pellicane led Villanova with 8 points.
</P>
<P>
   BC coach Cathy Inglese said there was one reason for Villanova's
abysmal shooting (19 percent in the first half, 23 percent for the
game) _ her team's defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our zone was a major key because they run such movement and
motion and cause everyone havoc,'' said Inglese. ``This zone, a 3-2
zone, we just gave to the kids yesterday in practice and that was
the key.''
</P>
<P>
   After a basket by Pellicane, BC went on a 10-point run to secure
a 12-2 lead with just more than 14 minutes to go in the half.
Villa-nova coach Harry Perretta promptly called a timeout and
summoned forward Stephanie Baker to go in for Brandi Barnes to try
to stem the tide.
</P>
<P>
   The move paid off in the short term as Baker promptly scored a
layup. But long term was another matter. BC's defense under the
basket forced the Wildcats to pass the ball around the perimeter
and take shots they couldn't hit. And the Eagles capitalized by
rebounding the misses; at the half, BC had 20 defensive rebounds to
Villanova's 12.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats tried to narrow the margin on 3-point shots, as
Pellicane and forward Jenea Skeeters each hit long balls, bringing
the Wildcats within 7 (17-10). But BC answered with treys by Murphy
and guard Nicole Conway and took off on a 7-2 run. Another
3-pointer by Pellicane with less than a minute to go and a jumper
by Jenn Sliwa with five seconds left cut the BC lead to 29-17 at
the half.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles pulled away after intermission, hitting 65 percent
from the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We followed our game plan by keeping down their outside shots
and limiting them to one shot, then kicking it up the floor as fast
as we can,'' said Gottstein.

 NO. 7 STANFORD AWAITS WASHINTON'S BEST SHOT  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ They are the Pac-10's most powerful team, blending
talent with grace, smarts with strength. And yet the Stanford
Cardinal has been rocked of late, a supposed national championship
candidate exposing its weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Washington will discover whether Stanford is
suddenly vulnerable or still formidable when the two teams square
off at Hec Edmundson Pavilion. Oddsmakers consider the game a
tossup.
</P>
<P>
   Seventh-ranked Stanford arrives with better credentials, leading
the conference with a 10-2 record, relying on five returning
starters who led the Cardinal to the Final Four last year. That was
a magical trip. This year's journey has been more difficult,
opponents gunning for Stanford as much as the hoop.
</P>
<P>
   Until last Saturday, Stanford craftily avoided a major crack-up.
Then USC showed up as a 16{-point underdog at Maples Pavilion with
its 3-9 Pac-10 record and left with a victory in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Losses to Connecticut, North Carolina, Maryland and Arizona were
all acceptable. But USC? It was at the same time baffling and
revealing, putting Stanford in a position of having to search for
more than open teammates.
</P>
<P>
   The answers are not particularly evident, but coach Mike
Montgomery has been attempting to come up with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The approach this year is `Don't give up anything on the
perimeter and foul the big guys,''' he said. ``We're not getting
anything out of the foul situation.''
</P>
<P>
   This was USC's plan. Taller Trojans like Enumclaw's Brian
Scalabrine muscled Tim Young and Mark Madsen underneath. For all of
his grit, Madsen is known as ``Mad Dog.'' But he's a mutt at the
free-throw line, hitting 56 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the floor, Scalabrine played farther out
than usual, attracting defenders, creating more room and
opportunities for free-lancing and penetrating teammates like
Brandon Granville.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies will have to leave lumbering Todd MacCulloch inside
where he is most productive. But the three left-handed forwards _
Chris Walcott, Thalo Green and Grant Leep _ might drift outside,
drawing Madsen away from the basket.
</P>
<P>
   Husky coaches can concentrate on strategy, knowing that focus
and motivation will not be a problem with the players. When
Stanford's in town, it's a big game. The Cardinal grabs your
attention like Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a big bull's-eye,'' said Washington coach Bob
Bender. ``They're getting everybody's best shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford faces full-court, halfcourt and off-the-court pressure
in terms of meeting expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we do, if it's not perfect, seems to be a negative
for us,'' Montgomery said. ``Subconsciously it's taken a toll on
us.''
</P>
<P>
   But for every chink, there is considerable armor. Everyone might
rev it up for Stanford, but there is something else at work in the
mind _ doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams get so focused on `Wow, we're playing Stanford,''' said
Husky point guard Senque Carey, who believes that intimidation
frequently benefits the Cardinal and contributes to poor shooting
by opponents. ``They also play great defense and take away a lot of
things.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Huskies are an average Stanford adversary, they will
shoot 38 percent and score 59 points. They will lead at halftime
because the trend has Stanford trailing at the break in each of its
last seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Cardinal will rally, perhaps belatedly but more than
likely in time to track down the hunted. Washington discovered as
much in Palo Alto on Jan. 3 when Arthur Lee scored seven points in
the final minute to hold off the Huskies 67-60.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's matchup with Carey should be pivotal. It should favor Lee,
a senior schooling a freshman, an All-America candidate humbling a
blossoming newcomer. But Carey has been a dazzling director thus
far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have time to be a freshman anymore,'' Carey said.
``The team doesn't need me to be a freshman. It needs me to be a
point guard.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies are as confident as Carey, especially now that
they're home again. Bender's squad is 15-8 overall and 8-5 in the
Pac-10, tied for third with UCLA and in excellent position to
secure an NCAA tournament bid.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off a loss at Oregon last Saturday, Washington remains
unbeaten at Hec Ed this season, winning nine in a row. The Huskies
have also proven worthy in Seattle battles against ranked
opponents, beating No. 11 New Mexico at KeyArena and No. 11 UCLA
and No. 10 Arizona at Hec Ed.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Thursday, if Stanford's smudges are glaring, the chants of
``overrated'' will echo from the student section again.

PAYTON'S GREATNESS CAN'T HIDE FACT HE NEEDS HELP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ So what if Jason Williams looks so young his favorite
TV show could be ``Teletubbies''?
</P>
<P>
   Williams, the prince of the Kings, has been a nightly highlight
on ``SportsCenter'' in this 50-game nutball season. The 6-foot-1,
190-pounder is a certified pistol _ as in Pistol Pete Maravich.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived in the NBA this season packing a pop, racking up
points and assists and making Sacramento forget it ever drafted
Bobby Hurley.
</P>
<P>
   With his hesitation moves and cross-over dribbles, Williams can
flat-out break ankles.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a lot of heart. He can play. He's got a little spunk
in his game,'' Gary Payton said.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday night was a significant milestone in Williams'
infant but wildly promising career. He stopped by Payton's house.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA's leading candidate for Rookie of the Year found himself
up against the leading man for MVP in this post-Jordan era.
</P>
<P>
   The Glove, folks, was in.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, for each of the Sonics' first seven games, Gary Payton
has not only been in, he's been on _ and on fire at that. Each of
the Sonics' six wins is directly attributable to the sheer will and
unique talent of the Sonics' point guard.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Payton led the Sonics in scoring for the
seventh straight game, racking up 34 points in 49 minutes. But the
Sonics lost in overtime to the Kings, 109-106.
</P>
<P>
   For Sonic watchers, these past few years of Paytonism has been
something to behold. It is the game within a game that Payton plays
so well. And it comes against the wave of point guards who come to
town looking to make an impression.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, the rookie up to bat was Williams _ and from
him, one drive-by was all Payton was going to stand for.
</P>
<P>
   And Payton did stand there, flat-footed, as the NBA's latest,
greatest addition to the point-guard ranks blew by him. Williams
broke clear and elevated for the uncontested layup.
</P>
<P>
   Payton, ever the one to know a dramatic moment, let the kid have
his moment of fun, but then put an end to it. Smiling, sneering,
Payton relished the chance to put some relish on the 23-year-old
kid who, despite the tattoos and big-time confidence, knew it was
his turn in this NBA fraternity to be schooled.
</P>
<P>
   But as Payton was schooling Williams in the art of being a class
NBA point guard _ complete with pointers on taking charges and
talking trash _ Payton's teammates stood around and watched as the
Kings whittled a 17-point third-quarter lead into a 75-all tie with
less than six minutes left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the Kings and resurgent power forward Chris Webber were
off to the races.
</P>
<P>
   Who cares about three games in three nights? The Kings knew
Payton was not getting consistent help and that the Sonics were
ripe for the taking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vin (Baker's) a great player but I didn't want to be the guy
he broke out of his slump against,'' Webber said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also knew Vin is a little tentative in the block so we
wanted to make him shoot a lot of turnaround jump shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker had 17 points on 8-for-20 shooting. Hersey Hawkins had 18
points off the bench and Detlef Schrempf added 13.
</P>
<P>
   Payton could draw only one conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to get some more help from everybody else
because right now, we're watching,'' he said. ``I'll be more than
glad to sit out there and dish to everyone else. It doesn't make no
difference to me. If you want to get involved in the game, that's
great.
</P>
<P>
   ``But putting me in the block, it's going to have to cease. We
need practice. We've got a lot of new guys who need to be in a
practice situation for our offense to click. We haven't had that.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton was not frustrated ... yet. But the nine-year veteran was
certainly the most pointed and poised he has ever been in handing
out a post-game critique of his Sonics, demonstrating perhaps a
keener interest in steering this Pacific Division ship.
</P>
<P>
   Payton picked up the NBA's Player of the Week honors for the
first week of the season. He has turned some other kind of corner,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Gary wants to be the best,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, he's considered one right now. And I think he wants
to win the title. Those are the two things: Win the title and be
considered the best _ in that order. And Gary hates to lose,''
Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not kidding. He hates to lose. He's afraid to lose. He
will keep me up playing pool until 2 or 3 in the morning until he
has beaten everybody. He won't leave a pick-up game on a loss. Even
video golf. The man is crazy about not wanting to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams got a taste of that Wednesday, but Payton's points and
energy could not solve the problem. Now the Sonics will have to
take Payton's advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need practice, practice, practice,'' Payton said.
</P>
<P>
   They also need someone else besides the Glove to take Sonic
opponents to school.
</P>

CELTICS PREVAIL IN 3 OVERTIMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER _ At this rate, you're going to get to see the
Celtics' games live on ``Good Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston and Vancouver dueled into the late British Columbian
night Wednesday, matching improbable 3-pointers, dealing with
questionable calls and enduring three overtimes before a survivor _
the Celtics _ finally emerged with a 131-129 victory. The game was
won on an old-fashioned 3-point play by, of all people, Andrew
DeClercq, who had 7 points in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Six players had 20 points or more, led by Vancouver's Shareef
Abdur-Rahim (39), while Ron Mercer and Antoine Walker each had 27
for the Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   Boston scored 5 points in the final 56 seconds to win.
DeClercq's play came with 15.8 seconds left and the Grizzlies' last
chance fizzled on their 31st turnover _ and rookie Paul Pierce's
seventh steal.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA season may still be lacking substance and style, but, in
the case of the last two evenings with these two teams, it has not
lacked drama.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver was playing a triple OT game on the heels of a double
OT game the night before in Anaheim. The Celtics were coming off an
emotional loss in Sacramento that seemed longer than regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Boston was lucky to even get to OT, needing a Dana Barros trey
with a half-second left in regulation to tie the game at 94.
Vancouver matched that in the second OT, with Sam Mack tying the
game on a 3-pointer from the corner. In between, there was a blown
8-point lead (Boston), some maddening calls (and non-calls), nine
lead changes, four foul-outs, and a bunch of players getting by on
fumes.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver led most of the third overtime, building a 4-point
lead on two occasions, the time at 129-125 on a runner by
Abdur-Rahim. But hoops by Pierce (26 points) and DeClercq's big
3-point play finally ended things.
</P>
<P>
   Boston trailed by 10 heading into the fourth, but needed only
4:10 to take its first lead, 80-79. The lead changed hands seven
times over the rest of regulation with the biggest lead by either
team being 4.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams were in a serious sleep deprivation situation heading
into the game. Each had played the night before. Each game had gone
down to the wire and, in Vancouver's case, to a second and third
wire. Each team then had an overnight flight into town, landing in
the wee hours.
</P>
<P>
   It was not surprising, then, to see both teams stumble a bit out
of the gate. The Celtics, however, continued to play under water
for most of the first quarter, recreating their role from the night
before. The result was a 9-point Vancouver lead after one.
</P>
<P>
   As was the case the night before in Sacramento, there was a
collective awakening in the second quarter. Mercer, Pierce, and
Walker picked it up offensively, enabling Pitino to press and trap,
a rarity this season. (Don't think that doesn't make him furious.)
The Grizzlies responded with a slew of turnovers and Boston got to
within a point (33-32) after a Pierce bomb from somewhere near
Whistler.
</P>
<P>
   Two things then happened. Abdur-Rahim started to score inside _
he had 8 of his 16 points in the final four minutes _ and Walker
started to look a lot like Eric Montross at the line. Walker was 1
for 6 from the line in the quarter, and the Celtics again fell
behind by 9, 47-38, in the closing seconds.
</P>
<P>
   But, on Boston's last possession, Walker freed himself up for a
long trey and, of course, it hit nothing but net. That gave him 11
points for the half and brought the Celtics within 6 (47-41) at the
break.
</P>
<P>
   Neither coach was able to inspire his troops at halftime as the
third quarter basically was an extension of the first two. The
Grizzlies got the lead back up to 9 until Mercer hit three straight
hoops offset only by a Mike Bibby free throw. The Celtics were back
within 4, but got no closer in the third.

SONIC PERFECTION SLIPS AWAY AS KINGS WIN IN OVERTIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Sonics forward Vin Baker finally made a free throw on
a night when the Sonics' free ride came to an end.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics, the NBA's only undefeated team going into the game,
failed to compensate for poor shooting and a lack of offensive
continuity during a 109-106 overtime loss to the Sacramento Kings
Wednesday night at KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   Despite posting a season-high point total, the Sonics (6-1) shot
a season-low 36 percent from the field. They squeezed off 110 shots
but missed 70 of them and are shooting 42 percent for the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not on the same page offensively,'' Sonics point guard
Gary Payton said. ``Our offense is not clicking and that's the
problem. When the play is called, we don't know what we should do.
We need to practice.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics had been riding Payton's hot hand and a sturdy
defense during their winning streak. Wednesday, Payton led the
Sonics in scoring for the seventh straight game with 34 points.
Payton, though, ran out of gas against the Kings. He shot 11-of-27
from the floor and was 1-of-3 in the extra period.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle dominated on the boards, grabbing 25 offensive rebounds
compared with eight for the Kings, and got 21 more field-goal
attempts than Sacramento, and still couldn't win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we approached this game the way we should
have,'' center Olden Polynice said. ``They have a good team. I knew
we weren't going to go undefeated. In some ways, this loss takes
the pressure off.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics were playing the second half of back-to-back games
after Tuesday's win against Utah. The Sonics held the Jazz to 56
points, fewest ever by a Seattle opponent.
</P>
<P>
   They continued the trend Wednesday, making key stops late in the
fourth quarter and in overtime. But the Kings took advantage of
their second-chance opportunities while the Sonics shot blanks.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento opened the overtime period by outscoring the Sonics,
9-2, capped by Chris Webber's dunk with 2:05 remaining. The Sonics
fought back with Detlef Schrempf's two free throws. Then, a layup
from Hersey Hawkins got the Sonics within 103-100 with 1:22 left.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Dale Ellis hit a 3-pointer that got the Sonics within
105-103. But Kings center Vlade Divac grabbed a loose ball and
scored a layup that put Sacramento ahead 107-103. Vernon Maxwell
iced the victory with two free throws.
</P>
<P>
   Webber's 23 points paced the 4-3 Kings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we overlooked them. We knew how talented they
are,'' said Hawkins, who chipped in with 18 points off the bench.
``It was one of those games where you let a team hang around and
they catch fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento overcame a 17-point deficit and led 89-83 with two
minutes left in regulation. But Baker answered with a fade-away
basket and Payton sank a 3-pointer to keep the Sonics close.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics later fell behind 94-92 when Webber converted a
three-point play with 12 seconds remaining. Hawkins, though,
grabbed Schrempf's missed jumper with .02 seconds remaining and
scored a layup that tied game at 94 and forced the extra period.
</P>
<P>
   By the fourth quarter, Sacramento hardly looked like a team
playing its third game in as many days.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics lost a 17-point lead in the third and clung to a
70-61 advantage at the start of the fourth quarter. Sacramento
battled back by outscoring the Sonics 9-1 to start the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a big third quarter,'' Sonics coach Paul Westphal
said. ``It was big enough that we didn't knock them out. We still
need a lot of work on our offensive execution.''
</P>
<P>
   About the only consolation in the loss was a mini-revival from
Baker.
</P>
<P>
   After missing his first four shots from the foul line Wednesday,
Baker finally broke a dreadful 0-for-18 streak. Baker stepped to
the charity stripe with 10:32 left in the fourth quarter to an
ovation.
</P>
<P>
   He appeared calm and hoisted a shot that touched nothing but
net. The struggling all-star missed his very next free throw, but
then delivered another season-first by being productive down the
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Baker scored 9 of his 17 points in the fourth quarter before
fouling out with 4:31 to play in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been kind of brainlocked on the floor,'' said Baker, who
now is 1-for-20 from the foul line. ``Hopefully I can use this game
to get back to playing the way I can play. I've been looking for
anything to springboard me, but unfortunately we lost. We should
have won the game.''

UCLA HOLDS OFF USC
</HEADLINE>

By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC had the smarts, the shooters and the savvy to
conjure its second major upset in five days, but the Trojans didn't
have the legs, and they did not have Baron Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Ferocious offensive rebounding in the final minutes and Davis'
16-foot jumper in the final seconds were enough to push the Bruins
past USC 68-63 Wednesday in one of the most entertaining games the
crosstown rivals have played in years.
</P>
<P>
   The 11,601 at Pauley Pavilion saw 10 lead changes in the second
half and a matchup reminiscent of the Harold Miner-Don MacLean
showdowns of the early '90s. There were no technical fouls, no
fights, just 40 minutes of energy and rhythm, passion and
performance _ from USC center Brian Scalabrine's first-half
shooting show to Davis' 16-foot fadeaway that gave the Bruins a
67-63 lead with 36 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had to shoot a mid-range jumper,'' Davis said. ``If I
had gone to the rim, I'd have picked up my fifth foul. They were
waiting to take a charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``See, I'm getting smarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis' mind was in better shape than his body.
</P>
<P>
   ``An hour before the game, I didn't think I was going to play,
but I wanted to tough it out,'' Davis said. ``I had the stomach
flu, and I was up until 3 a.m. (Wednesday morning). I didn't even
watch TV, that's how bad it hurt. I was just rolling in bed, hoping
it would go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis' shot, similar to his game-winner against Oregon two weeks
ago, extended UCLA's city series winning streak to 10 games and
ended its two-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   USC, meanwhile, was denied its second consecutive upset and
departed Pauley Pavilion pondering an opportunity lost. The Trojans
led 54-50 with 8:30 left when UCLA's full-court press turned up the
tempo and discombobulated USC's attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure dramatically changed the look of the game,''
Bruins coach Steve Lavin said. ``They were in such a nice rhythm
and getting into their sets.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans (12-11, 4-10) made one basket and scored just four
points in the final 5:43. Tired and overmatched athletically, they
were helpless against the Bruins' offensive rebounders in the final
minutes. Forward JaRon Rush had 25 percent of UCLA's 40 rebounds
and single-handedly kept several possessions alive.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, UCLA corralled 14 offensive rebounds while
USC had 10 defensive rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we came out as sharp as we did against
Stanford,'' Scalabrine said. ``(This) game was a little more of a
struggle. (UCLA) played more physical than Stanford. They did to us
what we did to Stanford.''
</P>
<P>
   The third component to UCLA's winning formula was its defense on
USC's leading scorers, Scalabrine and guard Elias Ayuso.
</P>
<P>
   Ayuso scored 13 points in the first 32 minutes and none in the
final eight. Scalabrine scored 20 points in the first 35 minutes
and none in the final 15, as Matt Barnes and Travis Reed played
denial defense all over the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of played a box-and-one out of our man-to-man,'' Lavin
said. ``We wanted to cut down their catches and make somebody else
beat us.''
</P>
<P>
   No one did. USC point guard Brandon Granville was 0 of 10.
Sharpshooter Adam Spanich was 2 of 6 and played one minute in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scalabrine did well tonight, and we didn't have too many other
people play well,'' Trojans coach Henry Bibby said. ``We can't beat
anybody that way.''
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the Bruins (18-7, 9-5) used an unconventional
starting lineup, with senior Brandon Loyd and junior Sean Farnham
joining Watson, Rush and Davis for the tipoff. Walk-on Todd Ramasar
was the sixth man and played two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   (Forward Jerome Moiso did not play because of tendinitis in his
right foot but might play Sunday against Syracuse.)
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's reserves-turned-starters held their own until the
regulars returned. Farnham was the most effective; after an early
exit, he returned to help contain Scalabrine and provide muscle
underneath. Playing like Bob Myers did several years ago, Farnham
finished with six points in a career-high 18 minutes and helped
UCLA regain the passion it lost in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can play better, but we played hard,'' Davis said. ``That
was my biggest concern. The stuff we didn't do well, we can clean
up in practice.''

DUCKS SLUGGISH IN DEFEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Success can be intoxicating, especially to a team not
all that familiar with it.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night the Mighty Ducks appeared drunk with the success
of six wins in their seven previous games. As a result, they
stumbled badly in a 6-2 loss to Edmonton at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you get too high or too content, things like this
happen,'' Ducks center Matt Cullen said. ``We just played and let
things happen instead of making things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Oilers were intent on making things happen,
especially in the third period when they turned a 2-1 lead into a
6-1 advantage in just over three minutes. Alexander Selivanov
scored three of the goals, including a deflection of a shot by Jana
Niinimaa at 4:42 that gave Edmonton a 3-1 lead and all but sent the
Ducks into a coma.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another lesson,'' said Anaheim coach Craig Hartsburg, who
mercifully pulled Guy Hebert in favor of Dominic Roussel after
Edmonton's fifth goal. ``Hopefully it's a mental wakeup call. When
you have success, you have to stay hungry. When good teams win they
move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim had a chance to move a game over .500, open a
seven-point advantage on eighth-place Edmonton and pick up two
points each on St. Louis and San Jose. But the fifth-place Ducks
(23-24-9) were just the tonic the struggling Oilers, 3-6-1 in their
previous 10 games, needed. The victory Edmonton moved six points
ahead of ninth-place Calgary and eight ahead of the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   A sluggish power play (1 of 7), turnovers and the miserable
third period combined to make it an early night for the crowd of
14,540, and the Ducks themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just played horrible,'' said Paul Kariya, who was
especially upset at the way the Ducks lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams like Dallas, Detroit, Philadelphia, win or lose they
play the same game night in and night out. Some games you are just
going to get beat, but tonight we beat ourselves from the drop of
the puck.''
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim has reached the .500 mark nine times this season only to
fall back each time.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks' feeble response to Edmonton's third-period outburst
was Steve Rucchin's 21st goal of the year after the Oilers had
taken a 6-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim failed to score during its 5:28 of power-play time in
the first period and it gave up a shorthanded goal to Mats Lindgren
to make things worse.
</P>
<P>
   Ranked fourth in the league on the power play, the Ducks managed
but one shot with the man advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers were unable to generate any pressure at even
strength, but they took the lead at 16:49 when Lindgren knocked in
a rebound of Rem Murray's backhander after the Ducks lost control
of the puck at the Edmonton blue line.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks did have several great chances to score earlier in the
period, but Mikhail Shtalenkov was more than up to the task.
</P>
<P>
   The former Duck turned aside Kariya on a shorthanded breakaway,
Teemu Selanne on a partial break, Ted Drury's one-timer from the
right circle and Fredrik Olausson's long shot through a screen in
the final minute of the period.
</P>
<P>
   The power play did break through 26 seconds into the second
period when Selanne knocked in a rebound of Olausson's shot from
the right point for his 27th goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But a little more than four minutes later the Ducks' No.1 line
turned the puck over and gave up a two-on-one break that the
Oilers' Mike Greer converted with a rebound shot from the
slot. &UR; !dlim!!end! &QL;

SCALABRINE GETS LITTLE HELP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After having so many players play a part in the
victory over Stanford, USC coach Henry Bibby didn't even need to
see a box score to figure out who contributed during Wednesday's
68-63 loss to UCLA before 11,601 at Pauley Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Center Brian Scalabrine had an inspired performance with 20
points and eight rebounds, and after that . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian played very well,'' Bibby said. ``We really didn't have
any other people playing well.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides guard Elias Ayuso, who added 13 points, no other USC
player scored in double figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody didn't show up to play tonight,'' Ayuso said. ``One
or two guys can't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of negative facts for the Trojans to ponder.
</P>
<P>
   _Point guard Brandon Granville was 0 for 10 from the field,
including 0 for 8 on his 3-point attempts.
</P>
<P>
   _Forward Jeff Trepagnier was 2 for 6 on free throws in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   _The Trojans did not score a field goal in the final three
minutes, 48 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the game was tied at 61 after Sam Clancy's follow shot
with less than four minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were still in the game even when people weren't playing
well,'' Bibby said. ``That's probably the worst we've played in the
last seven or eight games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a chance to win the game. We didn't make some shots we
normally make. Brandon is 0 for 10 from the field. He makes three
shots and we win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   No one was more dumbfounded than Granville, who scored 21 points
against Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what happened. I like playing at this place, too.
I couldn't get it to go down,'' Granville said. ``I couldn't hit
one bucket. That really hurt the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Without help, Scalabrine eventually wore down physically. He
didn't score another point after hitting a jumper with 15:24
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe I did (get tired). That's something I need to work
on,'' Scalabrine said. ``I think games like this where we play hard
and battle, this will help us in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   What about the NIT? The Trojans (12-11, 4-10) probably need to
win three of their final four games if they harbor any aspirations
of playing in the National Invitation Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three wins. And probably a win at Arizona,'' Scalabrine said.
</P>
<P>
   Ayuso was even tougher on the Trojans' chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to win all of them. All four games,'' Ayuso said.
</P>
<P>
   That would mean a huge upset over Arizona at McKale Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, we can't worry about that,'' Ayuso said. ``It's four
games or nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivalry lesson: Scalabrine believes he has a much better idea
about the intensity of the rivalry, especially after he barely gave
it much thought before the teams' first meeting in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I figured it out a little bit about USC-UCLA,''
Scalabrine. ``Last time we played, it was just another game.''
</P>
<P>
   Injury report: Granville suffered a bruised back and Ayuso a
bruised hip, but neither was considered serious and each should be
fine for next week's games.
</P>
<P>
   Happy birthday: Sophomore forward Shannon Swillis got a present
on his 21st birthday Wednesday. After not playing in USC's previous
three games, Swillis was inserted with 19 seconds left in the first
half against UCLA. He got a steal and then closed out the
possession with a dunk, his first points since Jan. 28.

 BROUHAHA OVER AMA JOURNAL'S POWER STRUGGLE  &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  The new editors of the scientific journal published by the
American Medical Association charged Wednesday that their former
boss, who was fired last month, had to fight off ``threats'' and
``intimidation'' from the organization's top brass and from
political enemies outside the AMA.
<P>
   The accusation adds another blow to the leadership of the
embattled medical association, which has long spoken and lobbied as
the voice of organized medicine but officially represents fewer
than 300,000 of the nearly 740,000 physicians in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. George D. Lundberg, the outspoken editor of the prestigious
journal for 17 years, was fired January 15 by Dr. E. Ratcliffe
Anderson, a retired Air Force brigadier general and the AMA's chief
executive officer. Anderson said publicly he had ``lost
confidence'' in Lundberg because his editor had published a Kinsey
Institute study detailing how college students define the words
``having sex'' in the midst of President Clinton's impeachment
trial over the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Lundberg had been under fire for many years because he
insisted on publishing controversial commentaries by leading
physicians on medical issues as well as studies detailing
professional shortcomings among many doctors.
</P>
<P>
   But immediately after he fired Lundberg, Anderson named two
senior editors of the journal to run it until a search committee
finds a successor.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the two ``interim'' editors, Dr. Phil B. Fontanarosa
and Dr. Richard M. Glass, issued a statement declaring, ``There
have been instances involving substantial pressure, threats,
intimidation and attempts both within the AMA and from others
outside the organization'' to influence the journal's policies and
content.
</P>
<P>
   The editors said it was Lundberg's ``steadfast and
uncompromising'' resistance to the interference that maintained the
journal's ``editorial independence'' in the face of repeated
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 editors of the world's leading scientific and
medical journals, including the prestigious New England Journal of
Medicine, have defended Lundberg and condemned the AMA chief for
compromising JAMA's editorial independence.
</P>
<P>
   Since Lundberg's firing, neither the AMA's senior management nor
its powerful Board of Trustees has made any effort to control the
journal's content, the interim editors said.
</P>
<P>
   Fontanarosa said in a telephone interview Wednesday that issuing
the statement was ``entirely our own decision'' and that he and
Glass had not consulted with Lundberg before issuing it.
Fontanarosa would not describe any of the specific instances of
``threats'' or ``intimidation'' that he and Glass said Lundberg and
his staff had encountered.
</P>
<P>
   The statement was e-mailed to reporters in response to an
interview in Wednesday's Chicago Tribune quoting Lundberg as
declaring:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think a day went by in considering what to publish
that I and my editorial staff didn't have to worry about offending
AMA members, AMA politicians and the AMA Washington office by what
we published.''
</P>
<P>
   The interview also quoted Lundberg as saying that the AMA's
public relations staff had tried _ in vain _ to get advance copies
of articles being considered for publication in the journal so they
could ``spin them for the AMA's corporate interests.''
</P>
<P>
   An AMA spokeswoman said last night that Anderson had seen the
statement by Glass and Fontanarosa but would not comment on it.
Lundberg was on his way to Harvard, where he lectures once a week,
and was unavailable.

   1. SIERRA LEONE IS NO PLACE TO BE YOUNG Conscripted into a

TODAY? A tough-parenting movement is telling permissive baby
boomers they've been doing it all wrong. And John Rosemond is the
pro-punishment Spock. Among an every-growing group of usually
conservative, often Christian givers of authoritarian child-rearing

HOW I WON THE MINNESOTA STATEHOUSE, BY JIMMY (BIG BOY) VALENTE AS
TOLD TO GARRISON KEILLOR This is a satire chronicling the rise of a

BOMB AGAIN ANOTHER DAY The stand-off missile and the smart bomb
seem to have become America's reflex answer to the dilemma of using
force without risk of being hit back. It has become so persuasive,
if only in Washington, that it distracts from the real issue of
force, which is : to achieve what? It has even come to block the
old routine question of how much damage was done, in order to judge
the value of the raid. By Flora Lewis. 800 words.

NOW IT'S PLANET MTV, ACTING GLOBALLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The slogan ``I want my MTV'' is now global, as the cable channel
keeps expanding at a relentless pace. MTV is in 70 million homes in
the United States but has mushroomed to 100 million homes in Asia _
including 30 million in China and 12 million in India, said MTV CEO
Tom Freston, who spoke at the Harvard Business School this week.
MTV is now in 79 countries.
</P>
<P>
   MTV launched last fall in Russia, where Freston said viewers
love the game show ``Singled Out'' (now canceled stateside), but
hate hip-hop, a staple in this country.
</P>
<P>
   MTV tailors its programming to the countries. In Russia, half
the content consists of Russian bands. And in Brazil, the station
is loose enough to run ads showing some nudity.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the toughest part of his job? ``Jet lag,'' said
Freston, who spends ``one-third to one-half of my year'' running
around to MTV's 42 offices worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Back in this country, MTV has refocused on music programming,
with an increase in prime-time videos and specialty shows such as
``Revue'' and ``Biorhythm,'' featuring individual artists. Also,
``Total Request Live,'' which airs from Times Square, runs in the
afternoons. ``The changes have helped bring ratings up 20 percent
in the last year,'' said Freston, adding that MTV may even bring
back the once-popular ``Headbangers' Ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, MTV doesn't play as many new acts as it used to (``We're
more mainstream,'' he conceded). Questioned about the controversy
of MTV playing more hip-hop than rock acts, he said, ``Hip-hop has
become the dominant music for people under 25. Who would have
thought that 10 years ago?''
</P>
<P>
   MTV's parent company, Viacom, also owns Nickelodeon and VH1.
Nickelodeon is the most popular of the outlets (with MTV second and
VH1 third) and celebrates its 20th anniversary on April 1. MTV
started in 1981 and VH1 in 1985. VH1's older-demographic audience
consists of ``graduates of MTV who still love music,'' said
Freston.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Kurds? Kurds? Whatever happened to the Chechnyans?
 &HT;    (For release Sunday, Feb. 21, 1999.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Let me see if I can understand this,'' I remarked to a
colleague who had spent time with Kurds in northern Iraq and Turkey
in the days immediately after Desert Storm. ``We are in daily
combat with Iraqi defenses over no-fly zones that we established
for reasons that included protecting Kurds from Saddam Hussein's
attacks and now the Kurds are attacking the embassies of our NATO
allies and others because a Kurdish leader, who many identify as a
terrorist the like of Osama bin Laden, has been jailed in Turkey,
which Saddam Hussein now says may be targeted by Iraqi missiles
because our planes take off from Turkey and bomb Iraqi defenses in
the zones in which we are protecting Kurds.''
</P>
<P>
   He told me I was correct. I told him I was confused. He laughed
a knowing laugh. So goes this tangled world.
</P>
<P>
   For most of this decade, I've been so overwhelmed trying to
understand previously obscure Kosovo and, earlier, Chechnya and
before that Bosnia and Herzagovina _ and always Northern Ireland,
and the Israelis and Palestinians _ that I wasn't ready for
Abdullah Ocalan and the Kurds.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, I'm still trying to understand why Idi Amin is
allowed to live in Saudi Arabia under Saudi protection when he
really needs to be brought to justice for the many atrocities he
committed in Uganda. We're chasing after Bosnians (or are they
Yugoslavs?), trying to prosecute them for war crimes committed in
this decade while Amin keeps fat and well-fed in Saudi Arabia,
which we protect from Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us cannot comprehend what is going on in tribal and
ethnic Africa, but a lot of people are dying there. The same is
true in the lower Asian archipelagoes.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know how the State Department keeps all this stuff
sorted out. Likely, they don't.
</P>
<P>
   On the periphery of world grievances, I have heard of the
incessant Kurdish goal of independence, an autonomy denied them in
the contiguous lands where they have lived for centuries: across
northern Turkey, Iraq and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   But it's always been a back-of-the-room item for the rest of the
world. Other conflagrations based on ethnicity and religion were on
the front burner. So, with bin Laden still not caught and vanished,
with Amin living off the Saudis, with any number of people being
sought for war crimes, with the pending extradition of Augusto
Pinochet from England to Spain, with U.S. planes in combat over
Iraq and with U.S. troops and warplanes about to head off to
Kosovo, the Kurdish revolt spreads itself, tout de suite, in a
cellular phone-coordinated assault, across the capitals of Europe
and Asia (and where else?), until it forces itself to the top of
the news.
</P>
<P>
   If the so-called ethnic Albanians can do it, if the Chechnyans
can do it, if any of the long-suppressed cultures of the Balkans,
the former U.S.S.R. and the Middle East can, by creating trauma,
bring the world's attention to their cause, why not? It seems to
work; seems to instill in the collective global conscience a desire
to settle a smoldering issue.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, it will not be surprising to see more of these flare
up.
</P>
<P>
   If laws were made to be broken, then borders also were created
to break down.
</P>
<P>
   My problem, however, is that I've lost track of who are the good
guys and who are the bad guys, and why sometimes we get ourselves
so tangled up that we are protecting bad guys within the framework
of trying to help good guys.
</P>
<P>
   As my wise old editor always said: ``This is not a simple life,
my friend, and there are no simple answers.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Making a federal case of everything
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the realm of duh: The main reason for the rash federalizing
of street crime of late is that federal crime legislation is
politically popular.
</P>
<P>
   No kidding? It took a high-powered task force impaneled by the
American Bar Association nearly two years to figure this out? It
did, and don't scoff. Sometimes even the self-evident needs a
ramrod to get through to the politically obtuse.
</P>
<P>
   It should help, too, that the task force was chaired by Edwin
Meese III, President Reagan's attorney general and no stranger to
law-and-order hustles himself. Count this a welcome case of it
takes one to know one.
</P>
<P>
   The ABA task force report tries to wave Congress off from the
accelerating trend to boost every new fad crime into the federal
code.
</P>
<P>
   Is car-jacking the crime du jour? Drive-by shootings? Failure to
report child abuse? Murder by escaped prisoners? Increasingly, the
spastic answer has been to make it a federal crime. Members of
Congress shy from blocking any such pitch out of the fear _ and
it's a reasonable fear _ that they'll be demagogued as soft on
crime in the next election.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the ABA report can help break that cycle. The report
convincingly argues that federalizing what ought to be state crimes
is worse than useless. It makes matters worse.
</P>
<P>
   The process upsets the proper constitutional balance between
national and local authority. It gums up federal courts with cases
that need not be there, to the neglect of cases that should. It
creates unfairness by making sentences dependent upon whether
defendants are charged under a federal or a state law, which
usually have different penalties for the same crime. It leads to
prosecutorial abuses because most federal crime statutes passed as
symbolic gestures are infrequently enforced, and infrequently
enforced laws are, almost by definition, enforced arbitrarily and
often for hidden agendas.
</P>
<P>
   And all to no useful end. The report bluntly concludes: ``There
is no persuasive evidence that federalization of local crimes makes
the streets safer for American citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   The Meese findings reinforce the plea in Chief Justice William
Rehnquist's 1998 report to end this practice. Federal crimes
filings increased 15 percent last year. Congress, Rehnquist wrote,
``contributed significantly ... by continuing to federalize crimes
already covered by state laws.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal courts,'' the chief justice wrote, ``were not
created to adjudicate local crimes, no matter how sensational or
heinous the crimes may be. State courts can, do and should handle
such problems.''
</P>
<P>
   With Meese and Rehnquist here, we finally have a couple of
conservatives acting conservatively, rather than like Robespierres
of the right.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, in a reverse-spin way, President Clinton's theft of the
law-and-order issue from Republicans, his willingness to match them
excess for excess in the bidding war, has opened some political
space in which at least a few on both sides of the ideological line
can stop posturing symbolically and begin thinking rationally about
criminal justice.

 &HT;    Miami Circle surrounded by preservation efforts
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Jenny Staletovich
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Near the mouth of the Miami River, where a rare chunk of
empty land forms a canyon among the condos and high-rises, the
discovery of an ancient Indian structure is changing the nature of
this city's sometimes impersonal self: devoted protesters linger
with candles, leaving behind birdseed and mementos, happy motorists
blast encouraging honks while a bridge tender blasts gawkers with
his loudspeaker, and bicycle cops joke with the lunchtruck driver.
</P>
<P>
   The site, part of an old Tequesta Indian village and dubbed the
Miami Circle by a growing number of followers, has fueled a sense
of preservation not seen here since, well, almost never.
</P>
<P>
   In the eight months since archeologists unearthed it, the
mysterious Circle cut into the oolite has captured national
attention, sent government into a bureaucratic tailspin, landed the
developer in a publicity nightmare, attracted all forms of UFO and
spiritualist enthusiasts, spawned a Web site with its own Web cam
and even brought Andy Rooney to the 8-foot fence that encloses it.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the fevered pitch rose another degree when
Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas vowed to seize the property
under the ominous domain law.
</P>
<P>
   To a bank of television cameras at the site, Penelas announced
that he could not ``stand by and let an important piece of this
city's history be destroyed,'' and would ``preserve it for present
and future generations of Miamians.''
</P>
<P>
   And none too soon.
</P>
<P>
   Developer Michael Baumann, who plans to erect twin, luxury condo
towers on the 2-acre site, has told county archeologist Bob Carr
that he has until Feb. 26 to complete his work. On Wednesday,
stonecutters from ABC Cutting Contractors arrived to size up the
job of excising the circle, 38-feet in diameter, from its bedrock
home.
</P>
<P>
   Also joining the fray Wednesday was former state representative
and Boca Raton attorney Barry Silver. Silver said he plans to sue
the city and Baumann on behalf of Bobby Billie, the spiritual
leader of the Independent Traditional Nation of Florida who claims
he is descended from the Tequesta, the American Indian Movement and
some others.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, a town where developers routinely pave over the past
for today's high-rises, this site has caused a stir like no other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done dozens of digs since '79,'' Carr said. ``And I've
never seen anything like it in my life. Maybe it's the location,
maybe the ceremonial nature, or that it's cut into the rock. In the
past when we made a discovery, we'd pick it up and take it to a
museum, but here it's a more daunting task.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Paul Onewalker, a member of the eastern band of Cherokee
who played in a quartet of ceremonial drummers Wednesday: ``If you
take the rock out of there, it's like taking your heart out of your
chest.''
</P>
<P>
   The structure was discovered during a routine archeological
survey performed by the county in June. By January, archeologists
had learned enough to conclude that the site was 500 to 800 years
old, possibly a tribal gathering place. Excited by what they
considered a unique discovery, Carr, his assistant and a handful of
amateur archeologists were busily excavating.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Circle, most artifacts from the old Tequesta
settlement had been found on the south side of the river. The
Circle constitutes the first significant discovery on the south
side.
</P>
<P>
   Archeologists were impressed by its architecture and
engineering. Four cardinal points are precisely aligned. The circle
itself is shaped by 30 holes in the bedrock while another 600 or so
surround it. Archeologist John Ricisak, who believes the site was
inhabited as long as 2,000 years ago, first theorized it might be
an observatory or celestial calender. Now he and others believe it
was a council meeting place used for, among other things, trading
with outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would make sense to put it across (the river) from the
village. They were inherently suspicious,'' said Danny Gregory, an
archeologist with the Archeological and Historical Conservancy.
</P>
<P>
   As word of the discovery spread, interest multiplied. When news
of the developer's deadline surfaced, what started as an
interesting, mostly academic endeavor with a mildly weird element
turned into a majorly weird carnival.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, protesters snuck onto the site and danced on the
circle. On a fence that has been erected in the last month to
enclose an original fence, a page from Dr. Seuss's ``The Lorax'' is
posted alongside a petition and other signs. Daisies and roses hang
from the fence's links. One sign announces daily vigils at ``6 and
12.'' Inevitably, they coincide with the arrival of television
satellite trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was kind of funny because there will be two
people and three TV crews,'' said Ted Ruffle, a Tampa visitor
attending a conference at the neighboring hotel, who stopped on the
bridge during an afternoon jog. ``I don't think it's going to do
anything. If you look around, there's 50 condos on the block.''
</P>
<P>
   But Moses Raudez, who joined the protest for the first time
Wednesday, waving a sign from the bridge at traffic, remained
blissfully optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least I know I tried,'' he said. Then screamed ``yeah'' at
a passing car.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a block away rests another remnant of the Tequesta,
uncovered when the city built its convention center nearly two
decades ago. At the time, city leaders agreed to set aside land as
a memorial and dubbed it Fort Dallas Park. Today, Bijon Nakhjavan,
who moved to Miami from Iran 27 years ago, operates his Bijon's On
the River at the site. Standing outside his restaurant, he points
to the nearby Hyatt Regency swimming pool, which he says rests
above ground because a burial site lies below it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should build around it,'' he says of the Circle, ``like
Jerusalem.

 &HT;    Ohio lawmakers try to decriminalize breast feeding
 &HT;    By Jennifer Chorpening
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Doctors say breast milk is best _ but Ohio law
says women who breast feed their infants in public could be
arrested for indecency. That's why two female Dayton legislators
are working on a bill to decriminalize what many mothers consider a
natural act.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio Sen. Rhine McLin (D-Dayton) and Rep. Dixie Allen (D-Dayton)
announced they will introduce a bill next week to change Ohio law,
which currently considers breast-feeding in public as a
fourth-degree misdemeanor, on a first time violation.
Breast-feeding itself is not illegal, just the public showing of
the nipple.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth-degree misdemeanor conviction can result in up to 30
days in jail and-or a $250 fine.
</P>
<P>
   This bill would give ``lactating mothers the right to nurse
their children without harassment,'' McLin said. And while she
doesn't know of any women actually charged for breast-feeding,
women have been harassed and told to stop, or go to the restroom,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you would like to have your dinner served in a
toilet or the facilities of a toilet,'' McLin said.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Twiggs, president of the Ohio Lactation Consultants
Association, spoke in support of the bill, and noted that one
reason women stop breast-feeding is because of the harassment they
receive in public places.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants to stay hidden in their house all the time,''
Twiggs said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill grants a mother the right to breast-feed her child in
any public or private location where the mother and child are
allowed to be present. The bill declares that ``nudity'' does not
mean the showing of a mother's breast during, or incidental to,
nursing.
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1995 study by Columbus-based Ross Products, a
division of Abbott Laboratories, about 21.6 percent of mothers
breast fed their infants for up to six months. McLin said she
looked at studies which suggest that breast-fed infants have more
natural immunity against diseases and infections.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, restrooms are less likely to be accommodating and
contain lounges than in past years, McLin said.
</P>
<P>
   If enacted, Ohio would join 22 other states that have similar
legislation, she said.

 &HT;    Car costs topped affordability charts in 1998
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ A new car _ anything from a Mercedes-Benz to a
Chevrolet _ was more affordable last year than at any time in
nearly two decades, a national study shows.
</P>
<P>
   The study, conducted by the Detroit-based Comerica Bank, reports
that it took 24.6 weeks of median pretax family income to buy an
average-priced new vehicle last year. That compares with 25.5 weeks
in 1997, according to the bank's Auto Affordability Index.
</P>
<P>
   The average price of a new vehicle last year was slightly more
than $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, vehicles were at the most affordable level since
1980, when new vehicle purchases absorbed an average 23.5 weeks of
income,'' Comerica chief economist David Littmann said.
</P>
<P>
   The index, compiled annually from Commerce Department and
Federal Reserve Bank data, is based on the total cost of a vehicle
divided by median family income.
</P>
<P>
   Automotive experts say a booming economy and less expensive cars
have made it a good time to buy a new car, truck or sport utility
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Annual income for Americans' grew 5 percent last year compared
with 1997, the study found. And many of the world's largest
automakers _ General Motors Corp., DaimlerChrysler and Ford Motor
Co. _ have either frozen or decreased sticker prices on popular
1999-model cars and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the low prices for most vehicles are going to stick
around for a while,'' said Jimm Horvath, director of the
Dayton-area Auto Dealers Association. ``There were 15.6 million
vehicles sold in the U.S. last year and that is considered an
incredible year. It would have been even bigger if GM hadn't been
shut down for two months with the strikes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Used cars were also moved off dealer lots at a record pace last
year. More than 40 million used cars were sold in 1998, the highest
figure since 1985 when ADT Automotive started releasing its 1999
Used Car Market Report. Used vehicle sales represented 72 percent
of all vehicle sales in the United States last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a strong economy and all the nice incentives being
offered by manufacturers, there really hasn't been a better time in
recent history to buy a car,'' said Craig Voss, marketing director
for the Voss Auto Network. ``And all signs point to vehicle sales
remaining strong.''

 &HT;    Stop me if you've heard these
 &HT;    By Ernest Murray
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ Here's three stories passed on to me that will
make you go ``hmmm,'' ``awww'' and ``argghh'' _ not necessarily in
that order:
</P>
<P>
   STORY ONE
</P>
<P>
   A man left the snow-filled streets of Chicago for a vacation in
Florida. His wife was on a business trip and was planning to meet
him there the next day.
</P>
<P>
   When he reached his hotel, he decided to send his wife a quick
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to find the scrap of paper on which he had written her
e-mail address, he did his best to type it in from memory.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, he missed one letter, and his note was directed
instead to an elderly preacher's wife, whose husband had passed
away only the day before.
</P>
<P>
   When the grieving widow checked her e-mail, she took one look at
the monitor, let out a piercing scream, and fell to the floor in a
dead faint. At the sound, her family rushed into the room and saw
this note on the screen:
</P>
<P>
   Dearest Wife,
</P>
<P>
   Everything prepared for your arrival tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Signed, Your eternally loving husband.
</P>
<P>
   PS. Sure is hot down here.
</P>
<P>
   STORY TWO
</P>
<P>
   This past Christmas, a fellow walks in on his 3-year-old
daughter wasting a roll of gold wrapping paper. Money was tight,
and he became infuriated when the child tried to decorate a box to
put under the tree.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the little girl brought the gift to her father the
next morning and said, ``This is for you, Daddy.'' He was
embarrassed by his earlier overreaction, but his anger flared again
when he found the box was empty.
</P>
<P>
   He yelled at her, ``Don't you know that when you give someone a
present, there's supposed to be something inside it?''
</P>
<P>
   The little girl looked up at him with tears in her eyes and
said, ``Oh, Daddy it's not empty. I blew kisses into the box. All
for you, Daddy.''
</P>
<P>
   The father was crushed. He put his arms around his little girl,
and he begged her forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   He keeps that gold box by his bed now. Whenever he is
discouraged, he takes out an imaginary kiss and remembers the love
of the child who had put it there.
</P>
<P>
   STORY THREE
</P>
<P>
   A man walking along a beach comes upon an ancient bottle.
Thinking he had little to lose, he rubbed it and to his surprise a
genie materialized.
</P>
<P>
   The genie, angry at being awakend, said, ``I've been doing this
for two millennia now and I'm sick of it. No three wishes for you,
only one, and make it snappy.''
</P>
<P>
   The man thought a moment and said, ``You know I've always wanted
to go to Hawaii, but I don't like to fly and I get seasick. I wish
for a bridge to Hawaii so I may drive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you crazy,'' the genie shot back. ``Do you realize how
much engineering it would take? I would have to sink concrete
pillars into the ocean floor. No. Too much trouble. Think of
something else.''
</P>
<P>
   The man thought a moment and said, ``Well, how about impeaching
Clinton?''
</P>
<P>
   The genie looked at him a long moment and said, ``You want that
bridge two-lane or four-lane?''
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, maybe they were in that order.

 &HT;    Polls miss passion of the true believers
 &HT;    By Arnold Garcia
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ There was a stark contradiction between the
national polls about the public's attitude toward the president's
impeachment and what my colleagues and I heard from readers and
callers.
</P>
<P>
   If those polls were to be believed, those respondents didn't
want the president removed and wanted the episode behind them.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, my mail, e-mail, phone messages and personal contact
indicated the opposite. I got some pretty good chewings-out from
supporters of the president and supporters of the special
prosecutor, but mostly the latter. The former thought our
editorials made too much out of nothing and the latter thought that
I was shirking my journalistic duty by not demanding William
Jefferson Clinton's head on a pike while we pondered a severe
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   The juxtaposition between polls and personal contact caused me
to repeat more than once the words of that immortal philosopher
Yogi Berra. Asked about a restaurant once, the baseball legend said
this: ``Nobody goes there anymore. It's too crowded.''
</P>
<P>
   If the polls were right, most people quit going to Chez
Impeachment. But if you judge Chez Impeachment by our callers and
letter writers, it was jammed.
</P>
<P>
   The great thing about the above Berra-ism is that the longer you
think about it, the clearer you see its truth.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent study on newspaper credibility by Chris
Urban, a widely respected communications industry consultant, 11
percent of people she surveyed had ever contacted a newspaper
editor about anything.
</P>
<P>
   Are you ready for the big surprise? In Austin, that figure was 8
percent. That 8 percent is fiercely committed to its viewpoint,
though, and is not the least bit shy about articulating it.
</P>
<P>
   The comments directed toward us by that 8 percent also reminded
me of another of Berra's observations: ``It was deja vu all over
again.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter-writers and callers took me back to the Watergate
days when I was but a young pup in this business. Though a young
pup, I caught plenty of hell from Republicans for what the news
media was doing to Nixon and plenty of hell from Democrats who
decried what the media wasn't doing to Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   It is to be expected that an issue of such grave national import
would arouse passion. If such an issue didn't arouse passion,
something would be terribly wrong, so the contradiction between the
national polls and personal experience never really bothered me.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was the experience covering Austin city politics over
the years that prepared me to deal with the contradiction.
</P>
<P>
   All that national hand-wringing about the loss of civility in
politics and the probing into personal lives bemused me. Here in
Austin, we pioneered that. Name-calling, assignment of motive,
guilt by association, ad hominem attacks and high-octane hyperbole
are just another way of saying ``howdy.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the yelling and screaming that usually surrounds an
Austin municipal election or issue, voter turnout _ the only true
test of interest _ is dwindling. Berra's comment about the
restaurant really applies here.
</P>
<P>
   A connection between attack politics and the drop in voter
turnout or even interest is long suspected, but we keep doing that
both in Austin and around the country. Consultants love that
wedge-issue stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe getting this close to the edge of a constitutional chasm
will cause a change, but I don't have much hope. Political
consultants want voters bases mobilized, and the best way to
mobilize is to dangle red meat.
</P>
<P>
   The more politicians pander to the extremes, the greater the
loss of the middle. The more that happens, the wiser Yogi Berra
gets. Nobody goes to the polls any more. They are too crowded by
true believers.
</P>
<P>
   There was an article last week about how the president was going
to target House managers of the impeachment case. He's going to rub
them out at the polling places, or try to anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope the president abandons that plan in favor of
salvaging what's left of his legacy. A fellow so concerned about
his place in history should work to be remembered as something
other than a punch line to a dirty joke.

 &HT;    Raising eyebrows, Perry's longtime friend expands his
legislative grasp
 &HT;    By David McNeely
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It was a weird press conference that revealed a
little tension over protocol in the usually clubby Texas Senate.
Although the Senate is almost by definition a room full of egos,
Sen. Troy Fraser (R-Horseshoe Bay) raised some eyebrows by moving
onto turf identified with other senators _ and seemed to be reined
in a bit by his friend and Senate presiding officer, Lt. Gov. Rick
Perry.
</P>
<P>
   The press conference had been called for Thursday upon
adjournment of the Senate by State Sen. David Sibley (R-Waco).
Sibley, considered the ranking Senate expert on telephone
regulation matters, wanted to discuss a bill he plans to introduce
dealing with the access fee local telephone companies charge
long-distance carriers.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, Fraser had held his own press conference to
discuss his filing of a telephone access charge bill. It came three
hours after Sibley had posted notice he would hold one on Thursday.
Reporters learned of Fraser's press conference just an hour before
it occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser's filing came as a surprise to Sibley and his staff. For
the past five years, Sibley has been studying the telephone issue
and overseeing interim studies on it.
</P>
<P>
   But since Perry took over the Senate's helm, other senators have
watched, wondering if Fraser, now in his third year in the Senate,
would be getting special treatment. Perry and Fraser have known
each other since they were 16, and Fraser joined Perry in the Texas
House of Representatives in 1989 after Perry encouraged him to run.
</P>
<P>
   Perry created a special Subcommittee on Technology and Business
Growth, chaired by Fraser, within the Economic Development
Committee that Sibley has chaired. The creation followed weeks of
rumors that Perry planned to jerk tort reform issues away from
Sibley and give them to Fraser to help curry favor with people like
David Weekley, the main figure identified with Texans for Lawsuit
Reform, a group pushing to cut down on consumer lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Perry did leave Sibley as chairman of Economic Development. But
he created the five-member standing subcommittee, with Fraser as
chair, in the midst of the seven-member committee.
</P>
<P>
   Then last week, some senators and other observers clucked as
Fraser, who is about as subtle as an unfiltered Camel cigarette,
jumped into issues identified with some of his Republican
colleagues. He introduced a bill concerning class-action lawsuits
on the same day that Teel Bivins (R-Amarillo) had. And he held a
press conference laying claim to the so-called Y2K issue, about
computer problems caused by the arrival of the year 2000, for which
Robert Duncan (R-Lubbock) had already proposed legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Add those to the seeming competition with Sibley, and a pattern
seemed to be developing.
</P>
<P>
   Back to the weird press conference, which indicated that Fraser
may finally have figured out he was stepping on some toes. After
Perry talked to both men, and Fraser talked to Sibley, Fraser
accompanied Sibley into a committee room for the press conference.
</P>
<P>
   With Fraser beside him, Sibley told the reporters present that
while he had planned to discuss his proposed legislation, ``we
anticipate coming back to you next week ... Sen. Fraser and I will
be co-authoring a bill.''
</P>
<P>
   The press conference lasted less than a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Later that afternoon, Sibley put out a brief press release that
said since Fraser had already filed a bill, ``we decided it would
be more productive and more beneficial to work together on this
issue.'' The idea of co-authoring the bill, Sibley said, is ``being
encouraged and supported'' by Perry.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Fraser's seeming intrusions into areas where Duncan and
Bivins had already been working, they dismissed the notion of any
turf wars.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan, a lawyer, confirmed businessman Fraser's assertion that
the two had been working cooperatively for months on Y2K. ``I
wouldn't say that he's been horning in,'' Duncan said. ``He hasn't
been out of line with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bivins, who has been considered the leader among the senators on
class-action matters for months, said he had talked to Fraser and
concluded introduction of class-action bills on the same day was an
``honest coincidence.'' Bivins said he had been working on the
legislation with representatives of a group called Texans for Civil
Justice, while Fraser had been working with Weekley's Texans for
Lawsuit Reform.
</P>
<P>
   When they discovered they were on the same path, Bivins said,
``we just threw in together.''
</P>
<P>
   Fraser said Thursday he plans to let the other senators in each
case take the lead on the issues, and would co-sponsor their bills.
Whether that means he will go at a slower pace on trying to insert
himself into some major issues remains to be seen.

 &HT;    Masseur has magic touch, but here's the rub: He treats your pets
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ When you're a pioneer in medicine, you
stick your neck out a little. And when your job involves
therapeutic massage of dogs and cats, well, you become easy prey
for jokesters.
</P>
<P>
   Pet masseur and animal behavior expert Michael Holloway knows
this. After he was quoted in a recent article in Time, he was
invited on a morning radio show.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to poke a little fun,'' Holloway says. ``They made
a few jokes.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's clear no matter how odd his line of work sounds, his
Boca Raton business, Pet Massage Rehabilitation Services, has found
a niche in a booming market. More and more owners who contribute to
the $21 billion pet-care industry are willing to pay extra dough
for alternative treatments: Acupuncture, herbal mood enhancers and,
yes, pet massage.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, business for Holloway _ who is a licensed
massage therapist (for humans) and former veterinary assistant _
has grown sevenfold.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway uses deep-tissue massage to facilitate recovery from
surgery and treat physical problems such as hip dysplasia. Therapy
is intended to work in tandem with whatever is prescribed by the
animal's veterinarian, much the way a physical therapist might
rehabilitate a human patient who had knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   But massage also heals behavioral problems, such as ``contact
phobia'' experienced by dogs who become fearful when approached by
strangers.
</P>
<P>
   Judy and Michael Odsess of Boca Raton turned to Holloway to help
their Old English sheepdog, Nathan.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan, now 6, suffered as a puppy from a shoulder disorder
caused by his rapid growth. After he underwent surgery to remove
damaged cartilage, the Odsesses hired Holloway, who began weekly
massage sessions. He also added two- to four-mile walks three times
a week.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Odsess said that when Nathan's veterinarian recommended
massage therapy, ``I thought it was insane. But it made sense.
Massage does work.''
</P>
<P>
   And the several hundred dollars they spend a month for the
treatments?
</P>
<P>
   ``I totally think it's worth it,'' Judy Odsess said. ``He's a
happier dog. He feels better. If Nathan needed acupuncture I'd get
that too.''

 &HT;    Nazis took away everything but her soul
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In the Auschwitz death camp and for the
following 50 years, Irene Zisblatt kept silent about the horrors
she saw and lived through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that silence was very, very important to our survival,
because if you weren't silent they took you right away,'' says
Zisblatt, 68, sitting in the living room of her Century Village
apartment in Pembroke Pines.
</P>
<P>
   Persuaded finally to tell her story to the Survivors of the
Shoah Visual History Foundation, the nonprofit organization founded
by filmmaker Steven Spielberg, Zisblatt discovered a new wave of
liberation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like inside me, this second life, an inner life that I
didn't release,'' she said. ``When I broke my silence, all these
memories that I suppressed for all these years, they just popped
right back. The pain was not important anymore. What was important
to me was I needed to share my pain with the world, so they cannot
let anybody be painful like this again.''
</P>
<P>
   And now, Zisblatt's story is a key part of the Oscar-nominated
documentary feature, ``The Last Days,'' which opens today. (There's
also a special screening to benefit the foundation at Mar-a-Lago in
Palm Beach on Sunday.)
</P>
<P>
   The film concentrates on the end of World War II, when Germany
realized defeat was inevitable, but continued exterminating the
Jews. Specifically, it focuses on the Hungarian Jews, who were
forced into ghettos, herded onto boxcars and transported to Poland.
</P>
<P>
   Zisblatt was born in the lush resort town of Poleno,
Czechoslovakia, which was later annexed into Hungary. A handful of
Nazi officers occupied the town, but her family was able to hide
for two weeks in their home, which had been sealed to suggest it
had been vacated. Eventually, they were betrayed by neighbors, sent
to the ghetto and then to Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen-year-old Irene was transported to the camp with her
mother, brother and sisters, all of whom would be killed soon after
arrival.
</P>
<P>
   In the film's most memorable sequence, Zisblatt talks of her
mother sewing diamonds into her daughter's skirt, telling her to
use them when necessary to buy bread. But the detainees were
stripped of their clothes, so Zisblatt quickly hid the gems in her
mouth. When she saw others being examined for gold fillings,
Zisblatt swallowed the diamonds. Throughout her many months in the
camp, she would retrieve them from her excrement and swallow the
diamonds again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because that was the only connection to my mother,'' Zisblatt
explains. ``By not giving up the diamonds it was holding on to a
past, holding on to a strength and (to) my mother's wish to buy
bread so I could be strong and work.''
</P>
<P>
   Zisblatt was determined not to be broken by her Nazi captors.
``I felt that there was something that they wanted from us,'' she
says softly. ``They already took our possessions, they already took
my family, they already took my freedom, they already branded me
with a number and took my name away. So there was something they
needed to take away in order to kill us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured the only thing that's left is my soul and they're
not going to take that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there were many times when Zisblatt's will to live ebbed.
``When I was ready to die _ like on a death march, where they were
shooting the ones that couldn't keep up with the march, they left
them on the road _ and I was ready for that,'' she says. At those
times, she recalls an older teen-age girl pulling her back on her
feet, repeating their joint pledge, ``Now remember, we're not going
to be ashes.''
</P>
<P>
   Zisblatt eluded the crematoriums and was freed by U.S. troops,
but she soon landed in another camp for displaced persons. A
soldier being shipped home took her name and background particulars
and placed them in an ad in a New York newspaper. There it was read
by her deceased father's oldest brother, who sent her a letter
asking her plans and enclosing a check for $500.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was overwhelmed,'' says Zisblatt. ``I sent back the check,
because I couldn't buy anything, I had no use for it.'' But she
wrote that she wanted to be with family, to rebuild her life and
start a new family.
</P>
<P>
   She moved to New Jersey, attended night school to learn English,
worked for RCA on a filament assembly line and eventually was sent
to Rutgers University to be able to work with the company's
engineers. ``I kissed the ground that I walked on where I was, that
I was given the opportunity to be in this country and be free and
not to ever be afraid again.''
</P>
<P>
   Zisblatt married, had two children and moved to South Florida in
1989 to alleviate her Krone's disease, which doctors said is
aggravated by conditions in the North. It is unclear whether the
disease is related to her confinement in Auschwitz, but she feels
that is likely.
</P>
<P>
   Pictures of her grandchildren fill many frames in Zisblatt's
kitchen, but the inscribed photograph that dominates her living
room is of ``The Last Days''' executive producer _ Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   All through her interviews in Los Angeles, she hoped to
encounter the director of ``Schindler's List.'' ``I didn't know
what to expect, but I figured, well, if we're going to work on this
for so long, I'm sure to meet him, right?''
</P>
<P>
   But it was not to be, until the documentary premiered. ``At the
screening, I figured, `Well, he's going to come for a few minutes.
He's going to run in, he's going to say `hello,' he's going to take
a picture and then be on his way, out the back door.'''
</P>
<P>
   However, Spielberg stayed to watch the film and spend time with
Zisblatt and the other four featured interview subjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the most compassionate, the most wonderful, caring
person,'' she says. ``To meet him and to touch him, it was like
touching an angel.''
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg had only one request. He knew she had the diamonds
from the concentration camp made into a tear-shaped pendant. She
had only worn it twice, at her children's weddings. But she wore it
to the premiere and Spielberg asked to touch it, to connect with
the triumph and the loss that it represents.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he took these diamonds and he kissed them like it was a
mezuzah,'' an ornamental scroll holder proclaiming one's Judaism,
says Zisblatt. ``And I cried for 24 hours after that.''
</P>
<P>
   As to watching the film that night, well, ``Half of the film, I
didn't even see, because I was crying so hard,'' she says.

   ROSENFELD-SHORTTAKES _ So, now that It is over, what has the
mainstream press learned? Frankly, not an awful lot: Something's
out of kilter in the news trade. (Arnold Rosenfeld is senior editor
of Cox Newspapers.) MOVED WEDNESDAY.

   ERNIEMURRAY-COLUMN _ LUFKIN, Texas _ Here's three stories passed

The Lufkin Daily News) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   GARCIA-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ AUSTIN, Texas _ There was a
stark contradiction between the national polls about the public's
attitude toward the president's impeachment and what my colleagues
and I heard from readers and callers. If those polls were to be
believed, those respondents didn't want the president removed and
wanted the episode behind them. (Arnold Garcia is the editorial
page editor of the Austin American-Statesman) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   MOVEDMCNEELY-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ It was a weird press
conference that revealed a little tension over protocol in the
usually clubby Texas Senate. Although the Senate is almost by
definition a room full of egos, Sen. Troy Fraser (R-Horseshoe Bay)
raised some eyebrows by moving onto turf identified with other
senators _ and seemed to be reined in a bit by his friend and
Senate presiding officer, Lt. Gov. Rick Perry. (McNeely, Austin
American-Statesman) MOVED

   BOOKS-SKUBE _ Translation is not a matter of searching out exact
equivalents. ``If I had to describe what I do,'' says Edith
Grossman, who has translated several of Gabriel Garcia Marquez's
works from Spanish into English, ``I would say that it's a matter
of ear and voice.'' Marquez's Spanish, for example, can be as
elaborate as Faulkner's English, but Grossman ``made no effort to
make his language more concise.'' The translator who sets out to
render Marquez in English must ``hear that voice in Spanish and
then try to find the best way to convey the same emotional impact
in English.'' The art is in adapting one language to another.

FAMILIES TODAY 
 THE GREAT TOILET-TRAINING DEBATE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ------------------------------------------------------
</P>
<P>
   EDITOR'S NOTE: What follows is a sample of Dr. T. Berry
Brazelton's column ``Families Today,'' which is distributed by The

is Professor Emeritus at Harvard Medical School, which recently
named a chair in his honor. In his weekly column ``Families
Today,'' Dr. Brazelton guides readers through a child's
development, from teething to the terrible twos and beyond, in
essays and Q&AMP;As.
</P>
<P>
   The following essay is about the hot-button topic of potty
training, which has been in the news lately _ including a front
page New York Times article featuring Dr. Brazelton. Another sample

</P>
<P>
   &UR; By T. BERRY BRAZELTON, M.D. &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``When should we begin to teach our child to use the potty?''
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the most common questions I am asked by parents _
especially lately, since this issue has been in the news.
</P>
<P>
   I still offer the same advice I've always given: Only a child
can decide when the time for toilet training has come. Any pressure
parents may feel from grandparents, nursery schools or friends
should be ignored. It's got to be the child's achievement, not
theirs.
</P>
<P>
   There are certain signs of readiness that parents can look for
to know when it's time to begin training. These include a good
understanding of words, concepts and instructions; a desire to
imitate important adults; an urge to put things where they belong;
and the waning of negativism. This will probably happen sometime
during the third year. I like to start at the age of 2 to show
children what we expect of them. Each step can then be theirs, if
parents watch their signals.
</P>
<P>
   When the time is right, here's what I recommend:
</P>
<P>
   1. Give the child a potty chair on the floor, so he can take it
wherever he wants. Call it his and let him get used to it as his.
</P>
<P>
   2. After a week, take him to sit on his toilet, in his clothes,
while you sit on yours. Read to him or give him a cookie to keep
him there momentarily. This is just to establish the daily routine
of sitting on it. If you take his clothes off, it's too invasive
and may frighten him.
</P>
<P>
   3. The next week, ask him if it's OK to take his diaper off so
he can sit on the potty, once a day. You sit on your potty, he sits
on his. Tell him: ``This is what Mommy and Daddy do every day.''
</P>
<P>
   4. The third week, take him to his pot with his dirty diaper,
undo it, then drop it in the toilet. Meanwhile, say something like:
``This is where you can go someday to do your b.m. This is what
Mommy and Daddy do. This is your pot. This is mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't flush his b.m. away while he watches. The child feels it
is part of him and wonders where it goes when it disappears. Don't
get rid of it until he loses interest and walks away.
</P>
<P>
   5. The next step is completely at the discretion of the toddler.
In fact, if at any time he resists a step, forget training for a
while.
</P>
<P>
   If he's been interested in the previous steps, however, you can
offer to take his clothes off and let him run around with a bare
bottom. Offer to put the potty in his room so he can go to it
himself when he wants to. Then, offer to remind him every hour to
try to go.
</P>
<P>
   If he's ready, he will be able to cooperate on the pot. If he
does produce something, congratulate him, but don't overdo it. Too
much praise can take away his own excitement about his achievement.
</P>
<P>
   6. If he's really ready, you can leave his pants off for longer
periods. If he has an accident on the floor, go right back to
diapers. Don't make a fuss. Simply say, ``We'll try again. There's
no hurry. Someday you'll do it like Mommy and Daddy.'' You are
depending on his desire to imitate and identify with you.
</P>
<P>
   Each step must be at his timing. If he gets worried or
resistant, pull back quickly. Offer him back his diapers, and try
to forget training for a while. He knows now what you are expecting
of him, and he'll do it when he's ready.
</P>
<P>
   7. Night training shouldn't begin until he's dry at his nap and
until he gives some signal that he wants to stay dry at night. Wait
until he has dry diapers or no urine for at least four to six hours
a day.
</P>
<P>
   A child will have to be really ready to cooperate to make night
training worthwhile. Unless he asks you to help _ or does it
spontaneously _ I'd eliminate nighttime as a project until he's at
least 3. Most children aren't ready until 4 or 5.
</P>
<P>
   As a society, we are far too uptight about pushing children to
be trained. The incidence of failures _ including children
withholding b.m.s and urine _ is rising today. Perhaps this is due
to the pressure on busy parents to have children trained by 3 for
nursery school. Fight that pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's due to confusion children feel when their parents
share the training steps with day-care providers. Don't do this.
For the best chance of success, toilet training should be something
personal between you and your child.
</P>
<P>
   In future columns Dr. Brazelton will answer selected questions
from readers. Questions or comments should be addressed to Dr. T.
Berry Brazelton, care of The New York Times Syndication Sales
Corp., 122 E. 42nd St., New York, N.Y. 10168. Questions of general
interest will be answered in this column; Dr. Brazelton regrets
that unpublished letters cannot be answered individually. &QL;

   &UR; By T. BERRY BRAZELTON, M.D. &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: My 9-year-old son is in the gifted and talented
program at school. Though he excels in music and arts and his
intelligence level is way beyond his years, he is easily
frustrated, cries frequently and does not do what he is told.
</P>
<P>
   His teachers call me all the time, telling me he is a discipline
problem and will not finish his work. He also does not seem to get
along with other children and is very unorganized.
</P>
<P>
   Could he be ADHD _ even though he makes straight A's when he
chooses to do his work? _ R.H., Guilford, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   DR. BRAZELTON: The diagnosis of ADHD _ Attention Deficit
Hyperactivity Disorder _ doesn't occur to me. Too many adults
(teachers and parents) use it as a sort of wastebasket diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, I would think that your son is feeling too much
pressure to perform. He may be a perfectionist and may not want to
take chances on being anything but perfect.
</P>
<P>
   The gifted program may be too pressured an environment for an
already inner-pressured child. Hearing that other children shun him
and that he is disorganized worries me. I urge you to have your son
evaluated by a child psychologist or therapist. It sounds as if he
may be feeling overwhelmed or depressed.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: Our 26-month-old son is very loving and well-behaved,
but when he gets mad or frustrated he acts out by hitting, kicking
or throwing things.
</P>
<P>
   What would you suggest we do? When we put him in timeout, he
gets frantic and more out of control _ not calmer. _ R.H., Missouri
City, Texas
</P>
<P>
   DR. BRAZELTON: His out-of-control, hurting behaviors are a mark
of how frightening it is to lose control. He needs you to help him
regain control and to help him understand his behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Hold him or contain him when he gets out of control (a timeout
is just for that purpose). As soon as you break the cycle, tell him
that you understand how upset he is but that you also want to help
him learn to control himself.
</P>
<P>
   It's too frightening to everyone (including him) when he loses
it.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: When my 4-year-old son wakes up at night, he comes
into our bed, saying he is afraid. We welcome him with open arms
and do not take him back to his bed. My question: By allowing him
to come into our bed, are we preventing him from learning to
overcome his fears and anxieties? Or is he learning a sense of
love, security and self-importance from us? _ M.J.M., Boca Raton,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
   DR. BRAZELTON: Both. You are certainly offering him security by
accepting him. But you aren't helping him overcome his
age-appropriate fears and nightmares. These are normal at his age,
when he is learning about his own aggressive feelings.
</P>
<P>
   During the day, he will need your help with those fears and your
understanding. He will best learn how to handle angry and
aggressive feelings from you and your spouse by modeling on you
both as you handle your own feelings.
</P>
<P>
   I won't tell you when to begin helping him go back to his own
bed, but it should be a goal. He'd be proud if he could learn to
handle his own fears.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: I am very upset about my 4 1/2-year-old grandson. He
is a bright, happy, verbal youngster at home. However, in
daycare/nursery school, he will not speak with the children or
teacher. This has been the problem since he started daycare at 2
1/2.
</P>
<P>
   His parents have been going with him to therapy for 16 months _
with two different therapists. He still won't speak in school,
though he participates in all activities.
</P>
<P>
   What are your thoughts? _ R.W., Baltimore, Md.
</P>
<P>
   DR. BRAZELTON: I assume that his parents have gotten an
evaluation from the therapists about whether your grandson has a
hypersensitive hearing problem or a sensory integration problem,
which can lead to an autistic-like interference in handling complex
environments. If he hasn't been evaluated, he should be.
</P>
<P>
   But if your grandson is not plagued with such a problem, he may
just be a child who participates visually. I have seen children who
are part of the group without ever participating openly.
</P>
<P>
   If no one pushes him, he'll probably start communicating on his
own.
</P>

   FAT-PREJUDICE (San Francisco) _ San Francisco may make it
illegal to discriminate against fat people. It's already against
the law here to discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color,
ancestry, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability
and place of birth. By RACHEL GORDON.
</P>
<P>
   HILLARY-SENATE (Albany, N.Y.) _ Although few political pundits
will bet on Hillary Rodham Clinton entering the Senate race in New
York, some think her nonresidency is a non-issue. Indeed, history
shows that Robert Kennedy, James Buckley and others dodged the
carpetbagger label to win or run well in the state. By JAMES M.
ODATO.
</P>
<P>
   COSMETIC-SURGERY (San Francisco) _ Infuriated by slick but
deceptive cosmetic surgery ads and enraged by a mounting death
toll, some California senators want to toughen laws to better
protect the public from unscrupulous or poorly trained doctors.
Current regulations are failing to safeguard patients, putting them
at risk in elective cosmetic procedures, a state Senate committee
was told. By ELIZABETH FERNANDEZ.
</P>
<P>
   SF-SCHOOLS (San Francisco) _ A legal settlement that jettisons a
15-year-old federal desegregation formula governing San Francisco's
public schools comes at a time when parents are waiting to hear
where their children will be enrolled. The end of the race-based
admissions system will have the greatest and most immediate impact
on Latino and black parents, whose children were readily enrolled
in the schools of their choice because of ethnicity. By JULIAN
GUTHRIE.

   AOL-NETSCAPE (San Francisco) _ While America Online Chairman and
CEO Steve Case barnstormed around Northern California talking up
his company, AOL announced that Netscape Communications' co-founder
Marc Andreessen will become its chief technology officer when the
merger of the two firms closes this spring. By EDWARD IWATA.
</P>
<P>
   MARC-ANDREESSEN (San Francisco) _ Marc Andreessen, the
hyperactive 27-year-old co-founder of Netscape Communications
Corp., who will soon become the chief technology officer for
America Online, gives an interview. By MATT BEER.
</P>
<P>
   INTEL (San Francisco) _ It's shocking. Craig Barrett, the
tanned, rock-jawed CEO of computer chip-making giant Intel,
confessed something Silicon Valley executives rarely utter out
loud: Many computer users probably really don't need to buy the
Santa Clara-based company's latest product. By MATT BEER.

   CELEBRITIES-SHAPE (Calabasas, Calif.) _ The bedrooms make a
Motel Six look glamorous. The meals are hardly enough to feed a
sparrow. The grueling schedule includes a daily 15-mile mountain
hike over terrain so steep that one stretch is known as
``Heartbreak Hill.'' And the cost _ $2,700 a week _ would cover a
down payment on a car. So why is the The Ashram such a popular
getaway spot for celebrities who want to get in shape? By CLIFFORD
PUGH.

<P>
   STUDENTS-DIET (Troy, N.Y.) _ Much like the middle-age spread
confronting baby boomers, the ``freshman 15'' _ that tendency to
gain about 15 pounds in the first year of college _ is greeted with
both humor and dread. But because it occurs at a vulnerable time,
college weight gain also causes considerable worry, particularly
among young women. By MICHAEL LOPEZ.
</P>
<P>
   BETSEY-JOHNSON (New York) _ Betsey Johnson doesn't just throw a
fashion show. She gives the very best party, where the hoi polloi
rub everything from noses and elbows to lips and thighs with such
amiable creatures as Amanda LaPore, a ``shemale'' who shows ``her''
assets every moment she can, and Frankey the Fabric guy, who does
Betsey's cloth, whose mid-back dreads have been growing for 10
years and who sports a tattoo on his chin. By CYNTHIA ROBINS.

   TRAVEL-CONSTANCE (Mainau, Germany) _ Lake Constance, or the
Bodensee as Europeans know it, borders three nations _ Germany,
Switzerland and Austria _ and Europeans have long treasured it as a
favored playground. Americans who venture there will discover an
entire island dedicated to flowers, one of Germany's nicest
wine-growing areas and several enchanting villages. It's an ideal
destination for a romantic holiday. By HARRY SHATTUCK. (Photos

   EASY-CLEANUP (Albany, N.Y.) _ Often it's not the cooking that's
so inconvenient, it's the cleanup. If scrubbing pots and pans for
an hour after dinner isn't for you, try cooking everything in one
skillet. The process is simple and can be adjusted for whatever
ingredients you are using. By RUTH FANTASIA.

<P>
   SURF-CHAMP (Princeton-by-the-Sea, Calif.) _ At the end of the
long and grueling day, it took a Flea to conquer a mountain. Darryl
``Flea'' Virostko, a 27-year-old surfer from Santa Cruz with a
strange nickname and an even stranger hairstyle _ bleached platinum
with dark leopard spots _ earned a place in surfing history by
winning the first-ever Men Who Ride Mountains contest at Mavericks,
the surf spot off Pillar Point known for its enormous, deadly
waves. By JANE GANAHL.
</P>
<P>
   BKC-STANFORD (San Francisco) _ Look who's back. The Stanford
University women's basketball team has ended its vanishing act, and
the rest of the Pac-10 must be just thrilled. By GWEN KNAPP.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   SALTER-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ I saw a billboard not long ago
that featured a pastoral scene very much like one I had found in
France. My eyes sucked in the pristine countryside. My ears could
``hear'' the peace. Then I read the billboard's printed message:
``Wherever you're going _ we're already there.'' It was an
advertisement for cellular phone service. Say it ain't so. By
STEPHANIE SALTER.

   FAT-PREJUDICE (San Francisco) _ San Francisco may make it
illegal to discriminate against fat people. It's already against
the law here to discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color,
ancestry, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability
and place of birth. By RACHEL GORDON.
</P>
<P>
   HILLARY-SENATE (Albany, N.Y.) _ Although few political pundits
will bet on Hillary Rodham Clinton entering the Senate race in New
York, some think her nonresidency is a non-issue. Indeed, history
shows that Robert Kennedy, James Buckley and others dodged the
carpetbagger label to win or run well in the state. By JAMES M.
ODATO.
</P>
<P>
   COSMETIC-SURGERY (San Francisco) _ Infuriated by slick but
deceptive cosmetic surgery ads and enraged by a mounting death
toll, some California senators want to toughen laws to better
protect the public from unscrupulous or poorly trained doctors.
Current regulations are failing to safeguard patients, putting them
at risk in elective cosmetic procedures, a state Senate committee
was told. By ELIZABETH FERNANDEZ.
</P>
<P>
   SF-SCHOOLS (San Francisco) _ A legal settlement that jettisons a
15-year-old federal desegregation formula governing San Francisco's
public schools comes at a time when parents are waiting to hear
where their children will be enrolled. The end of the race-based
admissions system will have the greatest and most immediate impact
on Latino and black parents, whose children were readily enrolled
in the schools of their choice because of ethnicity. By JULIAN

   MARC-ANDREESSEN (San Francisco) _ Marc Andreessen, the

Corp., who will soon become the chief technology officer for

<P>
   INTEL (San Francisco) _ It's shocking. Craig Barrett, the
tanned, rock-jawed CEO of computer chip-making giant Intel,
confessed something Silicon Valley executives rarely utter out
loud: Many computer users probably really don't need to buy the
Santa Clara-based company's latest product. By MATT BEER.

   CELEBRITIES-SHAPE (Calabasas, Calif.) _ The bedrooms make a
Motel Six look glamorous. The meals are hardly enough to feed a
sparrow. The grueling schedule includes a daily 15-mile mountain
hike over terrain so steep that one stretch is known as
``Heartbreak Hill.'' And the cost _ $2,700 a week _ would cover a

   To some, they're frightening. To others, they seem almost
magical. Their webbed wings help them soar through the night sky.
Their echolocation skills are a wonder. They are bats, one of the
most successful creatures on the planet: One out of every four
mammal species is a bat. Bats have left few fossils behind, so
their evolution remains an enigma among researchers. One of the
major points of contention is which came first, echolocation or
flight. Carl Zimmer, senior editor at Discover magazine, discusses
the debate in the scientific community over these unusual
creatures.

hasn't happened, although flaws have been found in certain e-mail

   Nancy Simmons went down to the jungles of French Guiana in 1991
with the seemingly simple mission of determining how many species
of bats live in one place. She surveyed her site for three field
seasons. She was overwhelmed by the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ended up getting 78 species of bats from an area that was
within a three-kilometer walk of our camp, just a pinprick on the
map.''
</P>
<P>
   The great variety of bats seen today is just part of the larger
evolutionary mystery surrounding these creatures. Simmons, who
works at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, is a
paleontologist by training. Before she entered the jungle to look
for live bats, she had spent years studying a miserably scrappy
record of bat fossils.
</P>
<P>
   Bats are not good candidates for paleontological study. When
they die, they usually disappear. Often they are eaten by
scavengers; if not, they decompose on the ground. The muscles and
membranous skin that make up their wings rot away. As a result
there are only a handful of complete bat fossils in the entire
world.
</P>
<P>
   Paleontologists like Simmons have studied those few relics
assiduously because, living or dead, bats pose one of evolution's
supreme puzzles. A few other mammals may be able to glide from tree
to tree, but only bats have evolved true powered flight. In fact,
only two other vertebrates _ birds and pterosaurs _ ever managed
this feat. But with little fossil evidence to go by, it's hard to
figure out how bats did it.
</P>
<P>
   What did the first bat look like, and how did it survive? And
how did bats diverge into the forms they take today? Piecing
together the story of bat evolution requires researchers to
determine in what order bats' marvelous flying and echolocating
(locating objects by means of reflecting sound waves) equipment
developed.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s one intriguing scenario was constructed by Brock
Fenton, a zoologist at York University in Ontario. Fenton suggested
that bats became echolocaters first and only later acquired the
ability to fly.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that a bat ancestor running through trees at night
on four legs, catching insects to survive, might have found it
could hear the faint echo of its calls as they bounced off a bug
flying past. Its descendants might have started to reach for
passing insects, and evolution would then have favored protobats
with longer and longer arms, and with webbing between their fingers
to help them catch their prey.
</P>
<P>
   Their calls would have become more focused and powerful, and
they might have been able to start gliding from tree to tree.
Eventually their descendants could fly under their own steam and
catch insects in midflight.
</P>
<P>
   That model came under fire, however, when John Speakman, a
zoologist at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, measured the
metabolic cost of an echolocating pulse and found that it cranked
up the animal's metabolism by a factor of nine. And that was for a
stationary bat _ how could a bat handle both that cost and the huge
metabolic cost of flight simultaneously?
</P>
<P>
   But when Speakman then measured the energy expenditures of bats
while they are flying, he got a surprising result. Bats, it turns
out, can use the energy required for flying to echolocate for free.
</P>
<P>
   The contracting muscles not only move the bat's wings but also
squeeze its rib cage, pushing the air out of its lungs and through
its voice box, creating the echolocating pulses.
</P>
<P>
   These results have led Speakman to question whether the earliest
bats could have evolved echolocation before flight, since it takes
so much effort while perching. Instead he has suggested that flight
and echolocation evolved hand in hand, improving by little steps
together.
</P>
<P>
   As with any transition in evolution, you can craft all sorts of
plausible scenarios for how bats came to be. The genealogy of bats
is a murky matter, though, and has inspired some pretty exotic
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, for example, John Pettigrew of the University of
Queensland in Australia suggested that megachiropterans, the giants
of the bat world, weren't bats at all but were actually closer to
primates.
</P>
<P>
   Largely in response to Pettigrew's work, there was an avalanche
of bat research in the late 1980s and the 1990s. Simmons was one of
those involved.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of paleontologist Jonathan Geisler, also of the
American Museum of Natural History, Simmons gathered together the
findings of other bat experts and examined many species of bats
herself.
</P>
<P>
   Based on her studies she adds her support to the idea that
megachiropterans are indeed bats and not primates with wings, as
Pettigrew claimed.
</P>
<P>
   The similarity of their wiring to that of the brains of
primates, she says, is just a sign that both groups got their start
using vision to live nocturnally. Thus all bats seen today, from
large, big-eyed fruit eaters to small, echolocating insect hunters,
descend from a common ancestor.
</P>
<P>
   Yet she also concludes that the megachiropterans did split away
from other bats long ago. Those fossil bats, she says, are actually
on the path toward microchiropterans, or ``little bats,'' the
suborder to which most bats belong.
</P>
<P>
   That means, Simmons points out, that the common ancestor of all
today's bats and the known fossils could already fly. And that
megachiropterans, while they have undergone a fair amount of
evolution since those early days, are in some ways relic
representatives of those first forms. Those ancient bats, she
reasons, couldn't echolocate. The few megachiropterans that can
echolocate today seem to have evolved the ability independently
from their smaller cousins.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to test the ideas of Simmons and Speakman and
others will be to get more evolutionary information. But
considering how hard it is to find bat fossils, it may be quite
some time.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Simmons will be returning to the jungles of
South America (this time Peru) to catch more living bats. There are
enough mysteries flying around in the night to keep her busy.

 By COREY S. POWELL  
 c.1999 Discover magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   A computer virus that could hide in an innocent-looking e-mail
message, slip past antivirus software and erase the files on your
hard drive would be a hacker's dream _ and a nightmare for the rest
of us. Fortunately, there is no such virus _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   But in July, computer engineer Marko Laakso and his colleagues
at the University of Oulu in Finland found a worrisome security
hole in three popular e-mail programs _ Microsoft Outlook Express,
Outlook 98 and Netscape Mail. A clever hacker, the Finnish
researchers warned, could exploit this flaw and transform an
ordinary bit of e-mail into a carrier for a data-destroying virus.
</P>
<P>
   The flaw arose not from some fancy new software feature but from
an old problem common to many e-mail programs. The programs'
designers assumed that the name of an e-mail attachment (something
linked to the message, such as another document or an image) would
be fairly short, so they set a 200-character limit for the length
of the name. If the name exceeds that limit, the extra data could
cause your computer to crash or possibly even instruct it to run a
rogue program hidden in the e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a common flaw, but one that's easy to fix,'' says
security specialist William Orvis of the Computer Incident Advisory
Capability at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in
California. The almost embarrassingly simple solution is to rewrite
the software so that the program shortens names longer than 200
characters.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and Netscape quickly publicized the problem and
offered free corrective software on their Web sites. A few days
later, Qualcomm announced that its popular Eudora e-mail software
contained a different flaw, which could allow a seemingly innocuous
Web link contained in an e-mail message to trigger a virus program.
The solution again was relatively simple. Despite the quick fixes,
however, the media and the Internet buzzed with news of a
frightening-sounding and pervasive vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   Those fears were largely groundless, says Orvis, who points out
that there has never been a documented case of a virus infecting a
computer as a result of someone reading e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't herd of anyone bitten by this attack,'' he says.
``Not that many people know how to exploit it. And if you did, the
FBI would be on your case very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the negative media coverage focused on everybody's
favorite villain, Microsoft. The software giant was charged with
skimping on security and offering an initial software fix that did
not cover all the potential weak spots in its Outlook e-mail
programs. But Laakso cautions that ``most of the major vendors make
the same kind of mistake.'' Moreover, other computer security
problems are far more serious than the threat posed by e-mail
viruses.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Hernan, who works at the Computer Emergency Response Team
at Carnegie Mellon, points to the much greater danger of intruders
who hack their way into Internet service providers _ the companies
that provide connections to the Internet. He notes that CERT has
received reports of interlopers invading computer systems operated
by hospitals, corporations and software vendors. Hernan blames
these broader security problems on sloppiness among the companies
that develop and sell the susceptible software _ and on the people
who buy their products.
</P>
<P>
   ``They produce what the public demands: feature-rich, faster,
easier-to-use products,'' he says. Security usually ranks very low
on the list of consumer concerns.
</P>
<P>
   People and companies that depend seriously on the sanctity of
their communications will need to be more cautious, says Orvis. He
gives this advice: Be careful and be prepared (in other words,
don't ever take candy _ or any free software _ from strangers, and
don't leave the only copy of your magnum opus on your hard drive).
Keeping on top of software updates and paying close attention to
security advisories will also help.
</P>

   A computer virus that could hide in an innocent-looking e-mail
message, slip past antivirus software and erase the files on your
hard drive would be a hacker's dream _ and a nightmare for the rest
of us. Fortunately, there is no such virus _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   But in July, computer engineer Marko Laakso and his colleagues
at the University of Oulu in Finland found a worrisome security
hole in three popular e-mail programs _ Microsoft Outlook Express,
Outlook 98 and Netscape Mail. A clever hacker, the Finnish
researchers warned, could exploit this flaw and transform an
ordinary bit of e-mail into a carrier for a data-destroying virus.
</P>
<P>
   The flaw arose not from some fancy new software feature but from
an old problem common to many e-mail programs. The programs'
designers assumed that the name of an e-mail attachment (something
linked to the message, such as another document or an image) would
be fairly short, so they set a 200-character limit for the length
of the name. If the name exceeds that limit, the extra data could
cause your computer to crash or possibly even instruct it to run a
rogue program hidden in the e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a common flaw, but one that's easy to fix,'' says
security specialist William Orvis of the Computer Incident Advisory
Capability at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in
California. The almost embarrassingly simple solution is to rewrite
the software so that the program shortens names longer than 200
characters.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and Netscape quickly publicized the problem and
offered free corrective software on their Web sites. A few days
later, Qualcomm announced that its popular Eudora e-mail software
contained a different flaw, which could allow a seemingly innocuous
Web link contained in an e-mail message to trigger a virus program.
The solution again was relatively simple. Despite the quick fixes,
however, the media and the Internet buzzed with news of a
frightening-sounding and pervasive vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   Those fears were largely groundless, says Orvis, who points out
that there has never been a documented case of a virus infecting a
computer as a result of someone reading e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard of anyone bitten by this attack,'' he says.
``Not that many people know how to exploit it. And if you did, the
FBI would be on your case very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the negative media coverage focused on everybody's
favorite villain, Microsoft. The software giant was charged with
skimping on security and offering an initial software fix that did
not cover all the potential weak spots in its Outlook e-mail
programs. But Laakso cautions that ``most of the major vendors make
the same kind of mistake.'' Moreover, other computer security
problems are far more serious than the threat posed by e-mail
viruses.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Hernan, who works at the Computer Emergency Response Team
at Carnegie Mellon, points to the much greater danger of intruders
who hack their way into Internet service providers _ the companies
that provide connections to the Internet. He notes that CERT has
received reports of interlopers invading computer systems operated
by hospitals, corporations and software vendors. Hernan blames
these broader security problems on sloppiness among the companies
that develop and sell the susceptible software _ and on the people
who buy their products.
</P>
<P>
   ``They produce what the public demands: feature-rich, faster,
easier-to-use products,'' he says. Security usually ranks very low
on the list of consumer concerns.
</P>
<P>
   People and companies that depend seriously on the sanctity of
their communications will need to be more cautious, says Orvis. He
gives this advice: Be careful and be prepared (in other words,
don't ever take candy _ or any free software _ from strangers, and
don't leave the only copy of your magnum opus on your hard drive).
Keeping on top of software updates and paying close attention to
security advisories will also help.
</P>

   Nancy Simmons went down to the jungles of French Guiana in 1991
with the seemingly simple mission of determining how many species
of bats live in one place. She surveyed her site for three field
seasons. She was overwhelmed by the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ended up getting 78 species of bats from an area that was
within a three-kilometer walk of our camp, just a pinprick on the
map.''
</P>
<P>
   The great variety of bats seen today is just part of the larger
evolutionary mystery surrounding these creatures. Simmons, who
works at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, is a
paleontologist by training. Before she entered the jungle to look
for live bats, she had spent years studying a miserably scrappy
record of bat fossils.
</P>
<P>
   Bats are not good candidates for paleontological study. When
they die, they usually disappear. Often they are eaten by
scavengers; if not, they decompose on the ground. The muscles and
membranous skin that make up their wings rot away. As a result
there are only a handful of complete bat fossils in the entire
world.
</P>
<P>
   Paleontologists like Simmons have studied those few relics
assiduously because, living or dead, bats pose one of evolution's
supreme puzzles. A few other mammals may be able to glide from tree
to tree, but only bats have evolved true powered flight. In fact,
only two other vertebrates _ birds and pterosaurs _ ever managed
this feat. But with little fossil evidence to go by, it's hard to
figure out how bats did it.
</P>
<P>
   What did the first bat look like, and how did it survive? And
how did bats diverge into the forms they take today? Piecing
together the story of bat evolution requires researchers to
determine in what order bats' marvelous flying and echolocating
(locating objects by means of reflecting sound waves) equipment
developed.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s one intriguing scenario was constructed by Brock
Fenton, a zoologist at York University in Ontario. Fenton suggested
that bats became echolocaters first and only later acquired the
ability to fly.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that a bat ancestor running through trees at night
on four legs, catching insects to survive, might have found it
could hear the faint echo of its calls as they bounced off a bug
flying past. Its descendants might have started to reach for
passing insects, and evolution would then have favored protobats
with longer and longer arms, and with webbing between their fingers
to help them catch their prey.
</P>
<P>
   Their calls would have become more focused and powerful, and
they might have been able to start gliding from tree to tree.
Eventually their descendants could fly under their own steam and
catch insects in midflight.
</P>
<P>
   That model came under fire, however, when John Speakman, a
zoologist at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, measured the
metabolic cost of an echolocating pulse and found that it cranked
up the animal's metabolism by a factor of nine. And that was for a
stationary bat _ how could a bat handle both that cost and the huge
metabolic cost of flight simultaneously?
</P>
<P>
   But when Speakman then measured the energy expenditures of bats
while they are flying, he got a surprising result. Bats, it turns
out, can use the energy required for flying to echolocate for free.
</P>
<P>
   The contracting muscles not only move the bat's wings but also
squeeze its rib cage, pushing the air out of its lungs and through
its voice box, creating the echolocating pulses.
</P>
<P>
   These results have led Speakman to question whether the earliest
bats could have evolved echolocation before flight, since it takes
so much effort while perching. Instead he has suggested that flight
and echolocation evolved hand in hand, improving by little steps
together.
</P>
<P>
   As with any transition in evolution, you can craft all sorts of
plausible scenarios for how bats came to be. The genealogy of bats
is a murky matter, though, and has inspired some pretty exotic
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, for example, John Pettigrew of the University of
Queensland in Australia suggested that megachiropterans, the giants
of the bat world, weren't bats at all but were actually closer to
primates.
</P>
<P>
   Largely in response to Pettigrew's work, there was an avalanche
of bat research in the late 1980s and the 1990s. Simmons was one of
those involved.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of paleontologist Jonathan Geisler, also of the
American Museum of Natural History, Simmons gathered together the
findings of other bat experts and examined many species of bats
herself.
</P>
<P>
   Based on her studies she adds her support to the idea that
megachiropterans are indeed bats and not primates with wings, as
Pettigrew claimed.
</P>
<P>
   The similarity of their wiring to that of the brains of
primates, she says, is just a sign that both groups got their start
using vision to live nocturnally. Thus all bats seen today, from
large, big-eyed fruit eaters to small, echolocating insect hunters,
descend from a common ancestor.
</P>
<P>
   Yet she also concludes that the megachiropterans did split away
from other bats long ago. Those fossil bats, she says, are actually
on the path toward microchiropterans, or ``little bats,'' the
suborder to which most bats belong.
</P>
<P>
   That means, Simmons points out, that the common ancestor of all
today's bats and the known fossils could already fly. And that
megachiropterans, while they have undergone a fair amount of
evolution since those early days, are in some ways relic
representatives of those first forms. Those ancient bats, she
reasons, couldn't echolocate. The few megachiropterans that can
echolocate today seem to have evolved the ability independently
from their smaller cousins.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to test the ideas of Simmons and Speakman and
others will be to get more evolutionary information. But
considering how hard it is to find bat fossils, it may be quite
some time.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Simmons will be returning to the jungles of
South America (this time Peru) to catch more living bats. There are
enough mysteries flying around in the night to keep her busy.

   A computer virus that could hide in an innocent-looking e-mail
message, slip past antivirus software and erase the files on your
hard drive would be a hacker's dream _ and a nightmare for the rest
of us. Fortunately, there is no such virus _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   But in July, computer engineer Marko Laakso and his colleagues
at the University of Oulu in Finland found a worrisome security
hole in three popular e-mail programs _ Microsoft Outlook Express,
Outlook 98 and Netscape Mail. A clever hacker, the Finnish
researchers warned, could exploit this flaw and transform an
ordinary bit of e-mail into a carrier for a data-destroying virus.
</P>
<P>
   The flaw arose not from some fancy new software feature but from
an old problem common to many e-mail programs. The programs'
designers assumed that the name of an e-mail attachment (something
linked to the message, such as another document or an image) would
be fairly short, so they set a 200-character limit for the length
of the name. If the name exceeds that limit, the extra data could
cause your computer to crash or possibly even instruct it to run a
rogue program hidden in the e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a common flaw, but one that's easy to fix,'' says
security specialist William Orvis of the Computer Incident Advisory
Capability at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in
California. The almost embarrassingly simple solution is to rewrite
the software so that the program shortens names longer than 200
characters.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and Netscape quickly publicized the problem and
offered free corrective software on their Web sites. A few days
later, Qualcomm announced that its popular Eudora e-mail software
contained a different flaw, which could allow a seemingly innocuous
Web link contained in an e-mail message to trigger a virus program.
The solution again was relatively simple. Despite the quick fixes,
however, the media and the Internet buzzed with news of a
frightening-sounding and pervasive vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   Those fears were largely groundless, says Orvis, who points out
that there has never been a documented case of a virus infecting a
computer as a result of someone reading e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard of anyone bitten by this attack,'' he says.
``Not that many people know how to exploit it. And if you did, the
FBI would be on your case very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the negative media coverage focused on everybody's
favorite villain, Microsoft. The software giant was charged with
skimping on security and offering an initial software fix that did
not cover all the potential weak spots in its Outlook e-mail
programs. But Laakso cautions that ``most of the major vendors make
the same kind of mistake.'' Moreover, other computer security
problems are far more serious than the threat posed by e-mail
viruses.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Hernan, who works at the Computer Emergency Response Team
at Carnegie Mellon, points to the much greater danger of intruders
who hack their way into Internet service providers _ the companies
that provide connections to the Internet. He notes that CERT has
received reports of interlopers invading computer systems operated
by hospitals, corporations and software vendors. Hernan blames
these broader security problems on sloppiness among the companies
that develop and sell the susceptible software _ and on the people
who buy their products.
</P>
<P>
   ``They produce what the public demands: feature-rich, faster,
easier-to-use products,'' he says. Security usually ranks very low
on the list of consumer concerns.
</P>
<P>
   People and companies that depend seriously on the sanctity of
their communications will need to be more cautious, says Orvis. He
gives this advice: Be careful and be prepared (in other words,
don't ever take candy _ or any free software _ from strangers, and
don't leave the only copy of your magnum opus on your hard drive).
Keeping on top of software updates and paying close attention to
security advisories will also help.
</P>
<P>
   That may seem like an awful lot of effort to the casual computer
user. But when it comes to computer security, the options are few.
People could choose to disconnect from the Internet _ an isolated
computer is, after all, a completely secure one. Or they could just
accept that sometimes things will go wrong.

IMPEACHMENT _ MISSING THE OLD DAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tell the truth: You miss it, don't you?
</P>
<P>
   You thought that you wouldn't _ you knew that you wouldn't _ but
now that the impeachment ordeal is officially concluded, you really
do miss it.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind all those polls that said the American people were
tired of impeachment and sick to death of the scandal that caused
it. Those polls obviously reflected the views of people who had
better things to do and more important things to think about _
people who had a life, in other words.
</P>
<P>
   But the pollsters never checked with you and me, did they? Mr.
Gallup never bothered to sample the vast silent majority that lived
for the impeachment drama in the same way that some folks live for
``Days of Our Lives'' or ``General Hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   The polls never measured the substantial segment of the
population that devoted every spare moment _ and some moments that
weren't so spare _ to reading about impeachment, to watching the
impeachment talk shows on television, to listening to the
impeachment discussions on radio.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a member of the Obsessive-Compulsive Impeachment Fan
Club, please raise your hand. If you are not a member, please get
your grubby fingers off the remote control; it's time to tune in
``Geraldo Live'' for a post-impeachment retrospective on the
political and legal ramifications of the latest escape by Bill
``Houdini'' Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it, fellow impeachment addicts: We are suffering
severe withdrawal symptoms in the aftermath of last week's
acquittal of the president in his Senate trial on charges of
perjury and obstruction of justice. Impeachment chief prosecutor
Henry Hyde hasn't been on television for days; Clinton's spokesman
hasn't stepped in front of the White House microphones to blast the
president's detractors for at least a week.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Monica Lewinsky's ex-friend Linda Tripp is making
the rounds of TV talk shows and is expected to write a book that
will help keep the Monica and Bill Show alive for months or years
to come.
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton pal James Carville is still breathing fire and
spewing invective in the direction of presidential nemesis Ken
Starr. So it's not as if the media's impeachment/scandal machine
has shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Well, OK, the machine hasn't even slowed down all that much. The
pundits are making noises about dumping the Clinton sex-and-lies
scandal in favor of even older news such as the JonBenet Ramsey
murder investigation, but any serious preoccupation with other
stories will have to wait until we've waded through the outpouring
of post-impeachment analysis.
</P>
<P>
   There are still winners and losers lists to ponder, and
speculation about Clinton's legacy in the wake of impeachment. And
what about all those examinations of the effects of impeachment on
Al Gore's presidential campaign, on Hillary Rodham Clinton's
possible Senate campaign, on the New York Yankees' chances of
winning another World Series?
</P>
<P>
   No doubt about it, folks _ there is much to do and much to say
about impeachment before we can relegate this story to the archives
of media insanity.
</P>
<P>
   Even beyond the regurgitation and recapitulation, the
Clinton-Lewinsky scandal has the potential to plow much new ground
in the way of news. Starr is said to be considering criminal
charges against Clinton, either now or after the president leaves
office in January 2001. And the independent counsel's office still
has several fringe players to harass and/or prosecute.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, impeachment aficionados will suffer temporarily if the
scandal train pauses to refuel. But it won't be long before we're
rolling down the tracks, full steam ahead, whistles blowing and
crossing signals flashing.
</P>
<P>
   Impossible, you say? Sensible people have had it up to here, you
say? The country simply won't allow this thing to drag on forever?
</P>
<P>
   Fine. Let's hope that just this once, restraint and common sense
will prevail. Let's hope that we can all move on, as Clinton likes
to say, and start focusing on the country's problems.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope. But let's don't hold our breath.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: MOVING FREELY THROUGH CYPERSPACE
 &HT;    Moving in (k) commentary and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday,
 &HT;    Feb. 21.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Americans pride themselves on leading the world in
the digital quest to conquer cyberspace. But Britain, which
introduced the first mass postal service some 160 years ago, has
leaped ahead by letting anyone with a computer and a phone line
access the Internet at no cost.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of Internet service providers now offer Britons free
unlimited access to the Internet, along with e-mail and large
blocks of data storage space. Earlier this month, giant British
Telecom waived all access fees for its online customers.
</P>
<P>
   How long before this tide crosses the Atlantic? No doubt, that
question must vex the folks at America Online Inc., which has
upwards of 16 million paid Internet subscribers in the United
States. (Britain's 900,000 AOL subscribers still pay the equivalent
of $34 per month.)
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing truly new here: Inexpensive safety razors
induced shavers to purchase blades. Nowadays, cheap cameras prompt
customers to buy film. Most U.S. newspapers are priced below cost
and depend on advertising to keep them whole.
</P>
<P>
   The Brits have come up with various marketing gimmicks to offset
the newly free links. (British Telecom can recoup because local
calls to the Internet are usually metered.)
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Internet technology is fast changing conventional
pricing for telecommunications as compressed data packets fly from
router to router at close to the speed of light.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, U.S. phone firms may soon move toward flat rate
billing, without regard to time or distance. Mobile telephony is at
the forefront. How long before this pattern is also widely adopted?
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the mobile phone market remains an unholy mess.
While digital connections, which are better than analog ones, are
taking hold, uniform standards have yet to be set. Moreover,
regulators need to forge regional mobile networks into a cohesive
national grid. And the policy of charging the party who gets a
call, rather than the party who makes one, makes no sense. (In
early Victorian times, a similar policy curtailed the use of the
Royal Mail.)
</P>
<P>
   In the world today, there are some 800 million fixed-line
subscribers, about 200 million mobile phone users and another 200
million people hooked up to the Internet, about a third of them in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   By 2005, according to projections by Motorola, there will be 1
billion fixed-line, 1 billion wireless and 1 billion Internet
users. (Motorola has recently placed some big bets that a large
chunk of these people will be wireless Internet users.)
</P>
<P>
   Esther Dyson was among the first of a growing group of digital
gurus who correctly sensed that information prices would fall on
the Internet. Says Dyson: ``While not all content will be free, the
new economic dynamic will operate as if it were.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason why few Internet firms, aside from those in
the connectivity business, make money. Some are draining capital
fast. Competition is rising because barriers to new entrants remain
nil. So far, the winners are the world's consumers, who are getting
more and better choices at ever lower prices.

   Dozens of Internet service providers now offer Britons free
unlimited access to the Internet, along with e-mail and large
blocks of data storage space. Earlier this month, giant British
Telecom waived all access fees for its online customers.
</P>
<P>
   How long before this tide crosses the Atlantic? No doubt, that
question must vex the folks at America Online Inc., which has
upwards of 16 million paid Internet subscribers in the United
States. (Britain's 900,000 AOL subscribers still pay the equivalent
of $34 per month.)
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing truly new here: Inexpensive safety razors
induced shavers to purchase blades. Nowadays, cheap cameras prompt
customers to buy film. Most U.S. newspapers are priced below cost
and depend on advertising to keep them whole.
</P>
<P>
   The Brits have come up with various marketing gimmicks to offset
the newly free links. (British Telecom can recoup because local
calls to the Internet are usually metered.)
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Internet technology is fast changing conventional
pricing for telecommunications as compressed data packets fly from
router to router at close to the speed of light.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, U.S. phone firms may soon move toward flat rate
billing, without regard to time or distance. Mobile telephony is at
the forefront. How long before this pattern is also widely adopted?
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the mobile phone market remains an unholy mess.
While digital connections, which are better than analog ones, are
taking hold, uniform standards have yet to be set. Moreover,
regulators need to forge regional mobile networks into a cohesive
national grid. And the policy of charging the party who gets a
call, rather than the party who makes one, makes no sense. (In
early Victorian times, a similar policy curtailed the use of the
Royal Mail.)
</P>
<P>
   In the world today, there are some 800 million fixed-line
subscribers, about 200 million mobile phone users and another 200
million people hooked up to the Internet, about a third of them in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   By 2005, according to projections by Motorola, there will be 1
billion fixed-line, 1 billion wireless and 1 billion Internet
users. (Motorola has recently placed some big bets that a large
chunk of these people will be wireless Internet users.)
</P>
<P>
   Esther Dyson was among the first of a growing group of digital
gurus who correctly sensed that information prices would fall on
the Internet. Says Dyson: ``While not all content will be free, the
new economic dynamic will operate as if it were.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason why few Internet firms, aside from those in
the connectivity business, make money. Some are draining capital
fast. Competition is rising because barriers to new entrants remain
nil. So far, the winners are the world's consumers, who are getting
more and better choices at ever lower prices.

PUTTING THE KIDS TO BED 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARY J. LOFTUS   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When we had one child, our bedtime routine never seemed
overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   A few books, lights out, a make-believe story or flashlight
shadows on the ceiling. It was our special time to share, when our
son cuddled more freely and shared his fears readily.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with two children, my husband and I often play tag-team,
swapping rooms in the middle of the routine so each parent has a
few minutes with each child.
</P>
<P>
   With Sarah in her footie pajamas or purple nightgown and Adam in
one of our oversized T-shirts, this is a time of whispered secrets
and tickle fights, ``I Spy'' picture hunts and chapter book
cliffhangers.
</P>
<P>
   But I always feel like it slips away from us.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah wants daddy to lie down on the floor beside her crib. Adam
wants to sleep in his Batman sleeping bag. Sarah wants the door
left open. Adam wants his music on. Often, one or the other ends up
in tears.
</P>
<P>
   Bedtime's rough, admits New York City therapist Anne Grizzle,
author of ``Mother Love, Mother Hate: Breaking Dependent Love
Patterns in Family Relationships.'' (Fawcett Columbine, $17.)
</P>
<P>
   But setting the right habits early and keeping them in place is
vital to helping a child develop independence later.
</P>
<P>
   ``One mother and father I know would both jump out of bed and
rush into their son's room at the sound of any little whimper. They
would always give him a glass of juice or something to eat, and
they'd either hold his hand until he fell back to sleep or take him
into bed with them.'' Grizzle recounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He actually got into the habit of waking up once or twice in
the middle of the night ... to enjoy a snack and his parents'
companionship.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other extreme, she says, some parents don't do enough
with their children to ease the transition into sleep:
</P>
<P>
   ``Another mother I know was usually quite tired when she came
home from work. She felt she had no time or energy to deal with
what she called the `little games' that her 4-year-old daughter
liked to play at bedtime. All the girl wanted was a few minutes of
hugging and chatting with her mother before she drifted off to
sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   I know parents who let their children ``put themselves to bed
when they're sleepy,'' and have no rituals at all. Then I know
parents who, like us, have let bedtime evolve into such an
elaborate system of stories and rituals that it can interfere with
the actual goal: going to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Most elementary kids need at least nine hours of sleep, with
some needing 10 or more. (A good rule of thumb is how long they
sleep when no one wakes them.) Sleepy kids are irritable, moody,
can't concentrate and are often hyper or lethargic - not the ideal
condition in which to send them off to school.
</P>
<P>
   Grizzle, and other therapists, suggest these simple steps: Have
a set bedtime that doesn't vary, a 15- to 30-minute routine with
plenty of hugging, reading and chatting about the day, a firm
good-night, and a one-time callback agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best payoff for parents is that their own
relationship may improve, once their children's bedtime becomes
less demanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a number of occasions, I've counseled couples whose main
problem with each other was that they were both tired,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``They simply weren't getting enough sleep, often because the
children were keeping them awake.''
</P>

FULL MEALS CAN COME FROM A SINGLE SKILLET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH FANTASIA  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Often it's not the cooking that's so
inconvenient, it's the cleanup. If scrubbing pots and pans for an
hour after dinner isn't for you, try cooking everything in one
skillet. The process is simple and can be adjusted for whatever
ingredients you are using.
</P>
<P>
   Just keep a few things in mind.
</P>
<P>
   To get a balanced meal out of the skillet, put a balanced meal
into it. Start with a protein such as meat, beans or legumes. Then
add a starch (rice or potatoes), liquid to keep the ingredients
bubbling, and at least two vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Place ingredients in the pan in the order in which they need to
be cooked. For instance, if you want the meat browned, cook it
first. Then add the starch and liquid. Add vegetables or fruit that
cook quickly such as corn, peas and apples last.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cover the skillet while cooking if the dish includes rice or
another grain that needs to absorb the liquid.
</P>
<P>
   _ Microwaving potatoes and carrots before adding them to the
skillet partially cooks dense vegetables so they come out tender
and roasted instead of hard and raw tasting.
</P>
<P>
   Practice the one-skillet cooking method with these recipes. Then
alter them to fit your family's preferences.
</P>
<P>
   Sausage Skillet: Peel 3 potatoes and cut into 3/4-inch cubes.
Microwave potatoes and 1 tablespoon water, covered, for 7 to 8
minutes. Drain. Cut 1 pound kielbasa into 1-inch pieces. Brown
sausage lightly in skillet over medium heat. Add potatoes and stir.
Cook until potatoes begin to brown with sausage. Add a small onion,
cut into wedges and 2 or 3 Granny Smith apples, cored and cut into
wedges. Cook another 10 minutes or until apple and onion pieces are
tender. Makes 4 servings.
</P>
<P>
   Pork Chops With Spanish Rice: Brown four to six pork chops in a
large skillet over medium heat. (Buy the least expensive pork chops
you can find. The very lean chops will not work in this recipe, as
they tend to become tough). Sprinkle 1/2 cup converted rice over
chops. Add 1/2 green bell pepper, chopped; 2 (14 1/2-ounce) cans
chopped tomatoes; 1/2 onion, chopped; salt and pepper. Cover
skillet and reduce heat to low. Simmer mixture until rice has
absorbed the liquid and chops are tender, about 45 minutes. Makes 4
to 6 servings.
</P>
<P>
   Cannellini Beans with Tomatoes: Saute 2 cloves garlic, thinly
sliced, in 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat. Add 2 cups
canned tomatoes, 2 teaspoons coarsely chopped sage leaves, salt and
pepper. Simmer for 5 minutes, breaking tomatoes up with a wooden
spoon. Add 4 1/2 cups cannellini (white kidney) beans and 1 1/2
cups of the bean liquid. Simmer, uncovered, 30 minutes. Add more
bean liquid if mixture becomes too thick. From ``The Four Seasons
of Italian Cooking'' (Time Life, 1998)
</P>
<P>
   One-Pan Greek Potatoes and Chicken: Cut 1 1/3 pounds potatoes
into 3/4-inch cubes. Cover with plastic wrap, venting one corner
and microwave 8 to 10 minutes. Cook 1 pound, boneless, skinless
chicken breast, cut into pieces in oil in a 12-inch skillet. Add
potatoes and cook about 5 minutes or until potatoes lightly brown.
Mix in 1/4 cup pitted olives, 1 tablespoon oregano, salt, pepper
and 1/3 cup crumbled feta cheese. From the National Potato
Promotion Board.

COLLEGE STUDENTS STRUGGLE WITH DIET CHANGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL LOPEZ  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TROY, N.Y. _ Much like the middle-age spread confronting baby
boomers, the ``freshman 15'' _ that tendency to gain about 15
pounds in the first year of college _ is greeted with both humor
and dread.
</P>
<P>
   The freshman 15 does spawn some jokes. But because it occurs at
a vulnerable time, college weight gain also causes considerable
worry, particularly among young women who are faced with the
strongest cultural messages about the slender ideal.
</P>
<P>
   Ask college-age women about it and they, in turn, will describe
a spectrum of reactions, from the lucky ones who have gained no
weight to others who valiantly are trying to balance their diet _
and perspective _ during the tumultuous freshman year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a normal part, but I don't want it to be my
normal part,'' said Russell Sage College freshman Meredith Patik,
19. On a recent evening at campus fitness center, a group of
students, including Patik, described textbook reasons why freshmen
gain weight.
</P>
<P>
   Patik, who gained 15 pounds, would overcompensate at mealtime to
accommodate her erratic schedule. ``If I knew I wouldn't be eating
for a while, I'd eat a really big meal, then end up finding a way
to make up what I didn't eat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely don't eat healthy, the way I should,'' said a
classmate, Rebekah Lancto, 19, who, on the run, grabs chips or
cookies. Her weight has fluctuated within a 10-pound range.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman weight gain is hardly surprising, given the enormous
changes these students face. Moving from home _ where someone else
is deciding the menu _ to college, freshmen are granted a newfound
freedom that extends to food.
</P>
<P>
   The dining hall food court has become a double-edged sword,
offering more variety than a generation before, but in unlimited
quantities.
</P>
<P>
   Also, people find company, and comfort, in food. Sitting around
the television often means eating popcorn or pizza. Weekends are a
caloric burst of pizza, wings, soda and beer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Food is a friend. It's very familiar and it can act as a
negative coping mechanism at times,'' said Paula Poulette, director
of counseling services at Sage's Wellness Center.
</P>
<P>
   For some women, the freshman 15 and decisions about diet can
lead to the recurrence or development of eating disorders, usually
characterized by the restrictive dieting of anorexia nervosa or the
cycle of bingeing-and-purging of bulimia.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Seattle-based Eating Disorders Awareness &AMP;
Prevention nonprofit organization, 91 percent of women recently
surveyed on one college campus said they had tried to control their
weight by dieting; 22 percent said they often or always dieted.
Women and girls comprise about 90 percent of people who have eating
disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists consider the transition from home to college life to
be a high-risk time for some women to develop eating disorders.
</P>
<P>
   A Sage junior, Nicole Cuesta, 20, said she had an eating
disorder in high school, which, though never formally diagnosed,
included compulsive exercising and restrictive dieting.
</P>
<P>
   The freshman 15 ``was something I knew about before coming to
college. I was worried about it and it still happened.''
</P>
<P>
   She slowly gained about 15 pounds, compensating for her dislike
of dining hall food by having food in her room, but then eating at
both places anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Cuesta, an athletic trainer, came to a realization. ``I felt
unhealthy. I felt very unhealthy and knew I had to do something
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now living off-campus and managing a lighter academic workload,
Cuesta is cooking for herself, eating a good breakfast and not
eating late.
</P>
<P>
   Modifications to diet constitute a large part of the advice
doctors and dietitians dispense about balanced eating. Exercise is
the other part of the equation for maintaining weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can maintain an exercise schedule, so that it happens
as regularly as your other courses, that will go a long way in
preventing major weight changes,'' said Dr. Sharon Alger, associate
professor in the division of clinical nutrition at the Albany
Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Freshmen, coping with academic and social stress, could benefit
from the calming benefits of exercise, also thought to help curb
the appetite, Alger said. Following the easy guidance of the food
pyramid and consuming adequate amounts of water also help to
promote a healthy diet.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has struggled with weight gain knows the simple
advice is easier said than done, but possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me three years to figure out what I needed to do,''
Cuesta said. ``I took on more responsibility for my own health.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _It's been a while since President Clinton was known
to play the saxophone.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, though, while dining with his Mexican counterpart,
Ernesto Zedillo, near the Yucatan city of Merida, Clinton sat in on
a small combo and laid down an impromptu rendition of the torch
standard, ''My Funny Valentine.''
</P>
<P>
   A paean to the two leaders' wives, no doubt, Clinton might just
as well have been playing to his host.
</P>
<P>
   A major theme of Clinton's presidency, after all, has been the
courtship of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   His whirlwind Merida summit with President Zedillo last week was
nothing less than a diplomatic lovefest, meticulously scripted to
send the message that relations are fundamentally sound between two
very different countries that just happen to share a
2,000-mile-long border.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are more than neighbors,'' Clinton proclaimed in a speech.
''More and more, we belong to the same American family . . . What
binds us together is far, far more important than what divides
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Optimism has become a cornerstone of Clinton's foreign policy,
whether the goal is to press for democratic change in China, force
a Balkans truce or craft a lasting Mideast peace -- objectives
that, to be sure, require mountains of faith to even pursue.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts, though, are arguing for a bit less window
dressing and a lot more candor from the White House when it comes
to U.S.-Mexico relations, particularly in such thorny areas as
trade, immigration and drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Few expect Clinton to change his tune this week(CQ), when he
decides whether to certify to Congress that Mexico is cooperating
fully with U.S. efforts to combat the scourge of illegalse
countries are cooperating fully with U.S. anti-narcotics efforts.
Countries whose programs are decertified face immediate suspension
of most U.S. aid -- humanitarian and counter-narcotics assistance
are excepted -- unless the president decides to sustain assistance
for national security reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress has 30 days in which to overturn the president's
certification recommendations, through a joint resolution, or allow
the White House ruling to stand.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim begins here.)
</P>
<P>
   Frustration among Congressional members -- and constituents
angered by the flood of drugs from Mexico -- has crested for the
past two years with vocal, if unsuccessful, legislative efforts to
decertify Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   More sound and fury is expected this time around, particularly
if the Clinton administration paints too rosy a picture of Mexico's
failed anti-drug policies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just can't ratify, nor sanction, a concept that tells the
people of both republics that this is coming along,'' sae.
</P>
<P>
   ``The data remains terribly disturbing,'' he said. ''We've got a
lot of work to do here.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends here.)
</P>
<P>
   The annual certification imbroglio gnaws at a relationship also
strained by immigration and economic issues.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans and Americans will make some 250 million legal border
crossings this year, one indicator of the growing economic and
cultural integration of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''With each crossing,'' said Clinton, ''we move beyond mere
diplomacy, closer to genuine friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, though, Clinton sees a glass that's half full.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 150,000 Mexicans immigrate legally to the United States
each year, adding richly to the country's pool of some 15 million
Americans of Mexican descent, but also competing with native
Americans for jobs while taxing the services of state and local
governments.
</P>
<P>
   At least as many slip into the country illegally. But while
numbers of illegal entries are fuzzy, Mexicans make up the largest
block of the estimated 400,000 people of various nationalities who
enter the country illegally each year, according to the Center for
Immigration Studies, a Washington, D.C. think tank.
</P>
<P>
   What drives the mass movements is the vast disparity between
living standards in Mexico, a nation of 95 million people with an
average per capita income of $4,400 per year, and the United
States, where, with 250 million people, per capita income averages
seven times that amount.
</P>
<P>
   That wage gap has also driven a major restructuring of American
industry, as thousands of U.S. manufacturers and suppliers have set
up shop in Mexico, aided by the low tariffs and investment
guarantees embodied in the North American Free Trade Agreement, or
NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who ramrodded the NAFTA through a reluctant Congress in
his first major, and still most dramatic, legislative victory,
hails the integration of the two economies as a step forward for
both countries. NAFTA, said Clinton, has strengthened both
economies, providing a buffer from the ravages of the global
economic crisis and a model for broader trade agreements he hopes
might one day link the entire Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, as U.S. exports to hard-pressed Pacific Rim nations
plummeted by 19 percent, two-way trade between the United States
and Mexico grew 11 percent to nearly $175 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That placed Mexico in third place, behind Canada and virtually
neck-and-neck with Japan, among U.S. trading partners. Mexico is on
track to eclipse Japan this year as this country's number-two
trading partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must expand this oasis of confidence and growth in our
hemisphere,'' Clinton said, reiterating his call for a Free Trade
Area of the Americas stretching from the Yukon to the southern tip
of Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, true to form, there's a flip side to the cheery
portrait Clinton paints of the cross-border economic ties.
</P>
<P>
   NAFTA opponents complain bitterly that the agreement, which was
negotiated by the Bush administration, has put to flight hundreds
of American factories, large and small, which have invested some
$30 billion building new plants in Mexico, sending good-paying jobs
south of the border.
</P>
<P>
   The trade picture, moreover, is grossly distorted, these critics
assert, because it counts as U.S. exports tens of billions of
dollars each year of relatively low-value parts and raw materials
that are shipped south and used to manufacture or assemble finished
goods that Mexico then exports to this country.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're processed in Mexico and sent right back here and the
only effect it has on U.S. employment is to reduce it and the only
effect it has on U.S. wages and incomes is to lower them,'' said
trade expert Alan Tonelson, research fellow with the U.S. Business
and Industry Council, a trade association representing more than
1,000 small and medium-sized
</P>
<P>
   manufacturing companies.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is simply a trade policy that's designed to encourage
outsourcing,'' said Tonelson, ''to encourage U.S. corporations to
move to Mexico and take advantage of low wages, lax regulations,
etcetera.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Charles McMillion(CQ), chief economist for the Washington
consulting group, MBG Information Services, ''It has the effect of
squeezing profits and squeezing wages in these companies and
forcing them, if they possibly can, to move at least some of their
production to Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Said McMillion, ''It's put incredible pricing pressure on them
over the last couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of other experts disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm an unapologetic optimist on this,'' said Chandler Stolp,
director of the U.S.-Mexican Policy Studies Program at the
University of Texas in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The shifts decried by NAFTA's critics, Stolp said, merely
represent the rational corporate response to a low-wage base on the
country's southern doorstep. That sort of integration, Stolp said,
helps U.S. companies compete favorably against their overseas
rivals, even as it offers Mexican workers a ladder up from poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ''If trade were just a matter of selling finished products to
each other, then Mexico and the United States really have very
little to do with each other,'' said Stolp. ''We're not competing
with Mexico, we're partnering with Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, for his part, concedes that the U.S.-Mexico economic
relationship is imperfect, as are links on immigration and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   What's important, he maintains, is not to curse the darkness,
but rather to light those candles that might be lit.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any complex relationship will have its ups and downs,''
Clinton said last Monday in Merida. ''But we know our differences
cannot divide us.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _It's been a while since President Clinton was known
to play the saxophone.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, though, while dining with his Mexican counterpart,
Ernesto Zedillo, near the Yucatan city of Merida, Clinton sat in on
a small combo and laid down an impromptu rendition of the torch
standard, ''My Funny Valentine.''
</P>
<P>
   A paean to the two leaders' wives, no doubt, Clinton might just
as well have been playing to his host.
</P>
<P>
   A major theme of Clinton's presidency, after all, has been the
courtship of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   His whirlwind Merida summit with President Zedillo last week was
nothing less than a diplomatic lovefest, meticulously scripted to
send the message that relations are fundamentally sound between two
very different countries that just happen to share a
2,000-mile-long border.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are more than neighbors,'' Clinton proclaimed in a speech.
''More and more, we belong to the same American family . . . What
binds us together is far, far more important than what divides
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Optimism has become a cornerstone of Clinton's foreign policy,
whether the goal is to press for democratic change in China, force
a Balkans truce or craft a lasting Mideast peace -- objectives
that, to be sure, require mountains of faith to even pursue.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts, though, are arguing for a bit less window
dressing and a lot more candor from the White House when it comes
to U.S.-Mexico relations, particularly in such thorny areas as
trade, immigration and drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Few expect Clinton to change his tune this week(CQ), when he
decides whether to certify to Congress that Mexico is cooperating
fully with U.S. efforts to combat the scourge of illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has patently failed to thwart a massive narco-crime
industry that U.S. authorities say will smuggle perhaps $30 billion
worth of drugs into the United States this year -- about 60 percent
of all the illicit drugs that will make their way onto the nation's
streets.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't expected to stop Clinton from giving Mexico's counter
drug efforts a passing grade; he signaled as much during last
week's summit by praising Zedillo's commitment to a U.S.-Mexico
alliance against drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond his instincts to put the best possible face on a messy
problem, Clinton is downplaying the failings in Mexico's anti-drug
efforts because to decertify would trigger painful sanctions
against Mexico, a key U.S. economic partner, and risk shattering
the relationship Clinton and Zedillo have met worked hard to forge.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clinton is clearly doing backflips to be able to send up
certification language to the Hill,'' said Mexico expert George
Grayson, professor of government at the college of William &AMP; Mary,
in Williamsburg, Va. To do otherwise, said Grayson, would ''poison
the relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Every year at this time, that relationship is tested by what has
become a diplomatic rite of spring, when the White House grades the
counter-narcotics efforts of Mexico and some 30 other countries
that are major sources or distribution channels for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1986 law, the president must certify to Congress by
March 1 of each year whether these countries are cooperating fully
with U.S. anti-narcotics efforts. Countries whose programs are
decertified face immediate suspension of most U.S. aid --
humanitarian and counter-narcotics assistance are excepted --
unless the president decides to sustain assistance for national
security reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress has 30 days in which to overturn the president's
certification recommendations, through a joint resolution, or allow
the White House ruling to stand.

   Frustration among Congressional members -- and constituents
angered by the flood of drugs from Mexico -- has crested for the
past two years with vocal, if unsuccessful, legislative efforts to
decertify Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   More sound and fury is expected this time around, particularly
if the Clinton administration paints too rosy a picture of Mexico's
failed anti-drug policies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just can't ratify, nor sanction, a concept that tells the
people of both republics that this is coming along,'' said Sen.
Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., a major player in the issue as chairman of
the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on the Western
Hemisphere. ''They need to make sure that it's absolutely clear
that the progress has been limited.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico detests the certification process and the annual
criticism it foments from its overbearing neighbor to the north.
</P>
<P>
   It is American drug consumption, Mexicans are quick to point
out, that provides the rich incentives for narco-criminals, whose
work undermines law and order in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel that it's a unilateral, subjective and unfair
process,'' Mexico's former ambassador to the United States, Jesus
Silva-Herzog, said in a telephone interview from Mexico City.
''It's difficult for us to understand how is it possible that the
largest consumer of drugs in the world becomes the judge.''
</P>
<P>
   Many in Washington recognize the Mexican government's
frustration, and Coverdell said Zedillo -- who just two weeks ago
earmarked for counter-narcotics efforts another $500 million --
deserves support for devoting high-level attention to the drug
problem.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Coverdell said, Mexico has done far too little to
combat narco-traffickers, or to rid the country of the official
corruption that enables them to operate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The data remains terribly disturbing,'' he said. ''We've got a
lot of work to do here.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ These are among the twists and turns in
King Norodom Sihanouk's life:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  April 1941 _ The French-educated prince is placed on the
throne at the age of 18 by Vichy French colonial administrators who
considered him pliable.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1940s _ Sihanouk takes his cousin Norodom(CQ) as his first
official wife and forms liaisons with scores of palace concubines.
``As king, we were not allowed to have more than one queen, but we
were allowed hundreds of mistresses,'' Sihanouk would later tell an
interviewer.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1952 _ Sihanouk divorces Norodom and takes up with Monique
Izzi, the daughter of a French-Italian father and a Cambodian
mother, whom he spotted in a beauty contest. Monique would become
his lifelong companion and is now his Queen.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1953 _ Sihanouk travels to France and convinces a weakened
French government to grant Cambodia independence. He remains bitter
at the United States because the U.S. State Department gave him a
brush-off.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  March 1955 _ The king dumbfounds Cambodia by abdicating in
favor of his father. Retaining his princely prerogatives as
``Citizen Sihanouk,'' he would rule Cambodia as an autocratic prime
minister denying Cambodians democratic rights, but giving them
nearly 15 years of peace, prosperity and international prestige.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  April 1955 _ Resisting American pressure to join the Southeast
Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO), Sihanouk becomes a Cold War
neutralist. He reaches world prominence at the Afro-Asian
nonaligned conference in Bandung and befriends Yugoslavia's Tito,
India's Nehru, Indonesia's Sukarno and China's Zhou Enlai.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1963 _ Angry at American intervention in South Vietnam,
Sihanouk calls on Cambodians to wear red arm bands in celebration
of the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy and the
deaths of two right-wing Southeast Asian dictators. The three will
``all meet in hell,'' Sihanouk exclaims.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1965 _ Bored with statecraft, Sihanouk throws himself into
cinematography, horseback riding and playing jazz saxophone. In the
next four years, he writes, directs, and produces nine feature
films, sometimes acting the romantic lead opposite his wife
Monique.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  By 1966 _ Sihanouk makes a secret military alliance with North
Vietnam, under which the North Vietnamese win permission to station
troops inside Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  October 1967 _ Sihanouk signals a warming with the United
States by receiving the widowed Mrs. Jacqueline Kennedy in
Cambodia's famed temples at Angkor Wat.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  January 1968 _ Sihanouk tells U.S. diplomat Chester Bowles
that he wouldn't protest if American troops crossed into Cambodia
in ``hot pursuit'' of enemy Vietnamese forces.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  March 1969 _ With Sihanouk silent, President Nixon orders a
secret operation in which B-52s drop 100,000 tons of explosives on
Cambodian villages and Viet Cong strongholds in eastern Cambodia
over four years.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  March 1970 _ Sihanouk is overthrown in a military coup led by
Cambodian Gen. Lon Nol. Though the right-wing general had tacit
approval from mid-level U.S. intelligence contacts, no clear
evidence has emerged to support Sihanouk's insistence that the CIA
overthrew him.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1970 _ Sihanouk goes into exile as guest of the Chinese and
North Korean rulers. He serves as figurehead leader of an alliance
of pro-Sihanouk and pro-Chinese guerrillas fighting against the Lon
Nol government. Sihanouk nicknames the latter group the ``Khmer
Rouge'' (Red Cambodians).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  April 1975 _ Ultra-Maoist Khmer Rouge guerrillas seize the
Cambodian capitol Phnom Penh, ordering a mass evacuation for forced
labor in the countryside. A murderous reign of terror begins under
the leadership of Pol Pot in which up to 2 million people perish.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  September 1975 _ Pressured by the Chinese, the Pol Pot regime
allows Sihanouk to return to Cambodia as its nominal head of state.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  March 1976 _ Upset by sights of destruction, Sihanouk tries to
resign and return to Beijing, but the Pol Pot regime refuses.
Instead, he and Monique begin three years of house arrest inside
the royal palace in Phnom Penh. Sihanouk later says that the Khmer
Rouge occupation led to the deaths of his five children, 14
grandchildren and four cousins.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1979 _ Vietnamese invaders defeat Pol Pot, capture Phnom Penh
and free Sihanouk, who flies out to resume his exile in Beijing.
Sihanouk becomes head of a guerrilla coalition that includes
remnants of the defeated Khmer Rouge. The coalition, now backed
both by the United States and China, aims to end Vietnam's military
occupation of Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1991 _ With the collapse of the Soviet Union, Vietnamese
forces pull out of Cambodia. Cambodian factions agree to a United
Nations call for a cease-fire. The following month, Sihanouk
brokers a crucial agreement among the factions that leads to a
peace settlement, along with the decision to place him back on the
throne.

   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ Only a few monarchs left in the world
really matter.
</P>
<P>
   And not one has mattered for longer than King Norodom Sihanouk,
Cambodia's master of dramatic intrigue for the last 58 years.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1940s, Sihanouk acted the playboy king with scores of
mistresses, the self-described ``randy rabbit.'' In the fifties, he
became the father of Cambodian independence from France and the
slippery Cold War neutralist.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixties, he occupied himself as the absolute ruler who
doubled as a film-maker. In the seventies, he became the figurehead
of the genocidal Khmer Rouge guerrillas and then the Khmer Rouge's
gilded prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, when Sihanouk was an exiled prince with slim
prospects of reclaiming his country, he was told by former U.S.
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger that he was as good an actor as
Sir Laurence Olivier.
</P>
<P>
   Now Sihanouk is back on the throne, playing the most improbable
role of his checkered career.
</P>
<P>
   At 76, history has cast him as the indispensable pacifier in a
country still traumatized by the Vietnam War and the subsequent
butchery of up to 2 million Cambodians in the ``killing fields'' of
the Khmer Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 12 million Cambodians are frightened that without
the king to balance the factions, Cambodia's 20-year civil war
could burst out again. Others fear that Sihanouk's death would
remove the last roadblock to dictatorial rule by Cambodia's Prime
Minister Hun Sen, a former communist with close ties to Vietnam and
China.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are lucky to have the king around with us,'' says former
government adviser Ok Serei Sopheak, coordinator of the Cambodian
Center for Conflict Resolution. ``But we have to ask ourselves how
to prepare for the day when he is not around. It is too easy every
time there is a problem just to turn to the king to solve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Few expected that then-Prince Sihanouk would make so much
difference when the political parties agreed to allow him to
reclaim his throne in 1993, after United Nations-brokered
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was head of Cambodia's 800-year-old royal family and a
descendant of Cambodia's great 12th century god-king Jayavarman
VII, he was relegated by the new constitution to ``reign but not
rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides that handicap, Sihanouk had been beset with colon
cancer, high blood pressure, diabetes and several minor strokes.
</P>
<P>
   But over the last six years, Sihanouk has emerged as a mixture
of Machiavellian politician and godlike Buddhist patriarch who is
summoned at the last moment by the squabbling politicians to save
his 12 million ``children'' from chaos. And for now, his cancer has
gone into remission.
</P>
<P>
   The king commands no armies. But when he enters a room, his
subjects kneel and try to touch him. When he wants to tame the
rival factions, he often does it by pulling one of his virtuoso
dramatic exits.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, King Sihanouk brought Prime Minister Hun Sen to heel
when he suddenly left his palace for the airport and caught a
commercial flight to Beijing, ostensibly for routine medical
treatment in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot stay in Cambodia with those republicans because they
are terribly unjust and barbarous to me,'' complained Sihanouk, in
a message to his subjects.
</P>
<P>
   At first, a newspaper loyal to Hun Sen chastised Sihanouk,
saying if he couldn't be a full-time king, he should ``let someone
else be a real king for Cambodia.''
</P>
<P>
   But a week later, Hun Sen backed down. ``We want to invite him
back,'' said the prime minister. ``The presence of the king is very
important for the continuity of the state . . . I beg the
newspapers not to criticize the king so harshly.''
</P>
<P>
   Last July, Sihanouk's importance increased. Another round of
elections produced an uncomfortably narrow edge for Hun Sen's
Cambodian People's Party over the royalist FUNCINPEC party, led by
the king's 54-year-old eldest son Prince Ranariddh.
</P>
<P>
   For three months, almost all ministries were paralyzed by
factional struggles, as the two main parties resisted a coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
   With rumors of coups roiling the city, the king put out the word
that he was leaving Cambodia for medical treatment in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen all but begged Sihanouk not to leave the country until a
government was formed. ``If the king leaves, we will miss legal
procedure,'' said a spokesman for Hun Sen. ``For example, who would
be the acting head of state if one were needed?''
</P>
<P>
   After a show of reluctance worthy of Shakespeare's Hamlet, the
king canceled his departure and spent a month conferring with one
faction and then another. Finally he worked out the coalition: Hun
Sen would become the sole prime minister, and Prince
Ranariddhntries are cooperating fully with U.S. anti-narcotics
efforts. Countries whose programs are decertified face immediate
suspension of most U.S. aid -- humanitarian and counter-narcotics
assistance are excepted -- unless the president decides to sustain
assistance for national security reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress has 30 days in which to overturn the president's
certification recommendations, through a joint resolution, or allow
the White House ruling to stand.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim begins here.)
</P>
<P>
   Frustration among Congressional members -- and constituents
angered by the flood of drugs from Mexico -- has crested for the
past two years with vocal, if unsuccessful, legislative efforts to
decertify Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   More sound and fury is expected this time around, particularly
if the Clinton administration paints too rosy a picture of Mexico's
failed anti-drug policies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just can't ratify, nor sanction, a concept that tells the
people of both republics that this is coming along,'' said Se250
million legal border crossings this year, one indicator of the
growing economic and cultural integration of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''With each crossing,'' said Clinton, ''we move beyond mere
diplomacy, closer to genuine friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, though, Clinton sees a glass that's half full.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 150,000 Mexicans immigrate legally to the United States
each year, adding richly to the country's pool of some 15 million
Americans of Mexican descent, but also competing with native
Americans for jobs while taxing the services of state and local
governments.
</P>
<P>
   At least as many slip into the country illegally. But while
numbers of illegal entries are fuzzy, Mexicans make up the largest
block of the estimated 400,000 people of various nationalities who
enter the country illegally each year, according to the Center for
Immigration Studies, a Washington, D.C. think tank.
</P>
<P>
   What drives the mass movements is the vast disparity between
living standards in Mexico, a nation of 95 million people with an
average per capita income of $4,400 per year, and the United
States, where, with 250 million people, per capita income averages
seven times that amount.
</P>
<P>
   That wage gap has also driven a major restructuring of American
industry, as thousands of U.S. manufacturers and suppliers have set
up shop in Mexico, aided by the low tariffs and investment
guarantees embodied in the North American Free Trade Agreement, or
NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who ramrodded the NAFTA through a reluctant Congress in
his first major, and still most dramatic, legislative victory,
hails the integration of the two economies as a step forward for
both countries. NAFTA, said Clinton, has strengthened both
economies, providing a buffer from the ravages of the global
economic crisis and a model for broader trade agreements he hopes
might one day link the entire Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, as U.S. exports to hard-pressed Pacific Rim nations
plummeted by 19 percent, two-way trade between the United States
and Mexico grew 11 peused to manufacture or assemble finished goods
that Mexico then exports to this country.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're processed in Mexico and sent right back here and the
only effect it has on U.S. employment is to reduce it and the only
effect it has on U.S. wages and incomes is to lower them,'' said
trade expert Alan Tonelson, research fellow with the U.S. Business
and Industry Council, a trade association representing more than
1,000 small and medium-sized
</P>
<P>
   manufacturing companies.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is simply a trade policy that's designed to encourage
outsourcing,'' said Tonelson, ''to encourage U.S. corporations to
move to Mexico and take advantage of low wages, lax regulations,
etcetera.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Charles McMillion(CQ), chief economist for the Washington
consulting group, MBG Information Services, ''It has the effect of
squeezing profits and squeezing wages in these companies and
forcing them, if they possibly can, to move at least some of their
production to Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Said McMillion, ''It's put incredibty.
</P>
<P>
   ''If trade were just a matter of selling finished products to
each other, then Mexico and the United States really have very
little to do with each other,'' said Stolp. ''We're not competing
with Mexico, we're partnering with Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, for his part, concedes that the U.S.-Mexico economic
relationship is imperfect, as are links on immigration and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   What's important, he maintains, is not to curse the darkness,
but rather to light those candles that might be lit.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any complex relationship will have its ups and downs,''
Clinton said last Monday in Merida. ''But we know our differences
cannot divide us.''

   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ If life in this faded regal city were a
Russian novel, the heroine's tragic death would not have been in
vain.
</P>
<P>
   But the chronicle of Galina(CQ) Starovoitova's life is not
fiction. In the ugly world of Russian politics, there is no
storybook consequence to her murder last fall at the age of 52.
</P>
<P>
   In what appeared to be a political assassination last November,
the federal legislator from St. Petersburg was shot three times in
the head as she climbed the stairs of her apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, she was viewed by her allies as a martyr whose
shocking death would surely inspire some essential changes to
Russia's faulty experiment with democracy.
</P>
<P>
   But three months later, her death is merely another in the long
list of grisly murders that have distinguished the state of
post-Soviet affairs in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The crime has not been solved; her political movement has not
been galvanized.
</P>
<P>
   With its crude democracy and volatile economy, Russia mocracy.
</P>
<P>
   Three former prime ministers and 10,000 mourners attended her
funeral. Some 1.8 million households in Russia dimmed their lights
on a night last November in her memory, according to the national
power company.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin and the nation's top leaders promised
that her killers would be caught and justice would be swift. A bank
offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and
conviction in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Liberals expressed outrage at Starovoitova's murder and promised
to work together to carry on her dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``The democrats are fighting among themselves,'' Ruslan Linkov,
a Starovoitova aide who was seriously wounded in the Nov. 20 gun
attack, saidg to run for the regional governorship in St.
Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   While popular and prestigious, she had little real power. In
part, Starovoitova was hampered because she was a woman. Men still
hold most positions of power in Russian politics and in this
male-dominated society there is no popular sentiment for that to
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is more of a public, than a real political figure. She
didn't affect anything . . . Galya(CQ) had authority over the
population, but she didn't have the authority to unite them,'' said
Kesselman.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Maybe because she was a women, maybe because she was
(seen as) naive -- today's condition requires a bit of cynicism.''

<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ These are among the twists and turns in
King Norodom Sihanouk's life:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  April 1941 _ The French-educated prince is placed on the
throne at the age of 18 by Vichy French colonial administrators who
considered him pliable.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1940s _ Sihanouk takes his cousin Norodom(CQ) as his first
official wife and forms liaisons with scores of palace concubines.
``As king, we were not allowed to have more than one queen, but we
were allowed hundreds of mistresses,'' Sihanouk would later tell an
interviewer.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1952 _ Sihanouk divorces Norodom and takes up with Monique
Izzi, the daughter of a French-Italian father and a Cambodian
mother, whom he spotted in a beauty contest. Monique would become
his lifelong companion and is now his Queen.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1953 _ Sihanouk travels to France and convinces a weakened
French government to grant Cambodia independence. He remains bitter
at the United States because the U.S. State Department gave him a
brush-off.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  March 1955 _ The king dumbfounds Cambodia by abdicating in
favor of his father. Retaining his princely prerogatives as
``Citizen Sihanouk,'' he would rule Cambodia as an autocratic prime
minister denying Cambodians democratic rights, but giving them
nearly 15 years of peace, prosperity and international prestige.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  April 1955 _ Resisting American pressure to join the Southeast
Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO), Sihanouk becomes a Cold War
neutralist. He reaches world prominence at the Afro-Asian
nonaligned conference in Bandung and befriends Yugoslavia's Tito,
India's Nehru, Indonesia's Sukarno and China's Zhou Enlai.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1963 _ Angry at American intervention in South Vietnam,
Sihanouk calls on Cambodians to wear red arm bands in celebration
of the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy and the
deaths of two right-wing Southeast Asian dictators. The three will
``all meet in hell,'' Sihanouk exclaims.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1965 _ Bored with statecraft, Sihanouk throws himself into
cinematography, horseback riding and playing jazz saxophone. In the
next four years, he writes, directs, and produces nine feature
films, sometimes acting the romantic lead opposite his wife
Monique.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  By 1966 _ Sihanouk makes a secret military alliance with North
Vietnam, under which the North Vietnamese win permission to station
troops inside Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  October 1967 _ Sihanouk signals a warming with the United
States by receiving the widowed Mrs. Jacqueline Kennedy in
Cambodia's famed temples at Angkor Wat.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  January 1968 _ Sihanouk tells U.S. diplomat Chester Bowles
that he wouldn't protest if American troops crossed into Cambodia
in ``hot pursuit'' of enemy Vietnamese forces.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  March 1969 _ With Sihanouk silent, President Nixon orders a
secret operation in which B-52s drop 100,000 tons of explosives on
Cambodian villages and Viet Cong strongholds in eastern Cambodia
over four years.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  March 1970 _ Sihanouk is overthrown in a military coup led by
Cambodian Gen. Lon Nol. Though the right-wing general had tacit
approval from mid-level U.S. intelligence contacts, no clear
evidence has emerged to support Sihanouk's insistence that the CIA
overthrew him.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1970 _ Sihanouk goes into exile as guest of the Chinese and
North Korean rulers. He serves as figurehead leader of an alliance
of pro-Sihanouk and pro-Chinese guerrillas fighting against the Lon
Nol government. Sihanouk nicknames the latter group the ``Khmer
Rouge'' (Red Cambodians).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  April 1975 _ Ultra-Maoist Khmer Rouge guerrillas seize the
Cambodian capitol Phnom Penh, ordering a mass evacuation for forced
labor in the countryside. A murderous reign of terror begins under
the leadership of Pol Pot in which up to 2 million people perish.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  September 1975 _ Pressured by the Chinese, the Pol Pot regime
allows Sihanouk to return to Cambodia as its nominal head of state.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  March 1976 _ Upset by sights of destruction, Sihanouk tries to
resign and return to Beijing, but the Pol Pot regime refuses.
Instead, he and Monique begin three years of house arrest inside
the royal palace in Phnom Penh. Sihanouk later says that the Khmer
Rouge occupation led to the deaths of his five children, 14
grandchildren and four cousins.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1979 _ Vietnamese invaders defeat Pol Pot, capture Phnom Penh
and free Sihanouk, who flies out to resume his exile in Beijing.
Sihanouk becomes head of a guerrilla coalition that includes
remnants of the defeated Khmer Rouge. The coalition, now backed
both by the United States and China, aims to end Vietnam's military
occupation of Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1991 _ With the collapse of the Soviet Union, Vietnamese
forces pull out of Cambodia. Cambodian factions agree to a United
Nations call for a cease-fire. The following month, Sihanouk
brokers a crucial agreement among the factions that leads to a
peace settlement, along with the decision to place him back on the
throne.

would become president of the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   As the king approaches the 58th anniversary of his first
coronation this April, the Cambodian capital has been in the grip
of the latest royal intrigue: who will succeed Sihanouk?
</P>
<P>
   He does not have the power wielded by the late King Hussein of
Jordan, who just weeks before his death stunned his family and
nation by withdrawing the title of crown prince from his brother
and conferring it upon his son, Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Ranariddh, who has commanded Cambodian troops and served
as co-prime minister in the early 1990s, is easily the best-known
of the princes. But he is not the consensus choice.
</P>
<P>
   Sihanouk's current wife, Queen Monique, is widely suspected to
be collaborating with Prime Minister Hun Sen to arrange for the
eventual accession of the king's oldest son by Monique, Prince
Sihamoni, 46. Sihamoni _ a ballet dancer and U.N. official living
in France -- is viewed by many as a less contentious choice.

<P>
   The Cambodian constitution leaves it to the Council of the
Throne -- made up of Buddhist leaders and top parliamentary and
government figures -- to choose a male successor from the royal
family within one week of the king's death.
</P>
<P>
   Though few believe it, King Sihanouk insists he won't be part of
the closing drama. ``I have no right to designate (or suggest the
designation of) my successor or a regent,'' he said.

   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ If life in this faded regal city were a
Russian novel, the heroine's tragic death would not have been in
vain.
</P>
<P>
   But the chronicle of Galina(CQ) Starovoitova's life is not
fiction. In the ugly world of Russian politics, there is no
storybook consequence to her murder last fall at the age of 52.
</P>
<P>
   In what appeared to be a political assassination last November,
the federal legislator from St. Petersburg was shot three times in
the head as she climbed the stairs of her apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, she was viewed by her allies as a martyr whose
shocking death would surely inspire some essential changes to
Russia's faulty experiment with democracy.
</P>
<P>
   But three months later, her death is merely another in the long
list of grisly murders that have distinguished the state of
post-Soviet affairs in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The crime has not been solved; her political movement has not
been galvanized.
</P>
<P>
   With its crude democracy and volatile economy, Russia often is
compared to the American Wild West. If so, Starovoitova was viewed
by many as one of the white hats. She was an articulate and popular
campaigner for human rights and democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Three former prime ministers and 10,000 mourners attended her
funeral. Some 1.8 million households in Russia dimmed their lights
on a night last November in her memory, according to the national
power company.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin and the nation's top leaders promised
that her killers would be caught and justice would be swift. A bank
offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and
conviction in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Liberals expressed outrage at Starovoitova's murder and promised
to work together to carry on her dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``The democrats are fighting among themselves,'' Ruslan Linkov,
a Starovoitova aide who was seriously wounded in the Nov. 20 gun
attack, said in a recent interview with the Cox News Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even after these tragic events. A lot of people cannot
overcome their political and personal ambitions,'' he said from the
sanatorium outside St. Petersburg where he is convalescing.
</P>
<P>
   No arrests have been made and the investigation into her death
has been clouded by charges that prosecutors are on a political
witch-hunt -- against Starovoitova's allies and journalists
covering the case.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors abound about the motive for her killing: published
reports in Russian newspapers that she had possessed incriminating
evidence linking St. Petersburg's incumbent governor Vladimir
Yakolev with organized crime; another report suggesting it was an
inside job by her own allies looking to manufacture a political
crisis; a third alleging that she had extensive business interests
and the murder may have been over money, not ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Many here, in St. Petersburg believe the truth will never be
known.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interested parties surrounding this crime are just clouding
the investigation,'' said Mikhail Ivanov, St. Petersburg editor of
the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda.
</P>
<P>
   Starovoitova emerged as a public figure in the energetic days of
perestroika, when the Soviet Union was compelled to relax its grip
on the people. She was pointedly anti-communist and worked to
protect dissidents and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   An early supporter of Yeltsin, she became a prominent legislator
in the years after the fall of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the best intentions of Russians who had hoped to find
meaning in Starovoitova's murder, the political void was too big
for one dead gentlewoman to fill.
</P>
<P>
   The democratic movement, dynamic at the start of the decade when
the Soviet Union was crumbling, is now tainted by failure. It is
marked by years of Yeltsin's inability to produce a working
democracy, and by rabid profiteering and corruption that has
produced an elite class of wealthy Russians and masses of poorer
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Russia remains in the throes of an economic crisis that began
last summer, and still delivers more pain. Little wonder that
Russians believe, not in the promises of their politicians, but in
trying to feed and clothe themselves. In opinion polls, the
Communist Party continues to cling to its lead in Russia, though
with no more than 20 or 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Russians wholly embrace neither communism nor democracy. There
are no dead martyrs in today's Russia, just as there are no living
heroes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody has to raise this symbol, and there is no one like
that,'' said Leonid Kesselman, a democratic activist and political
analyst in St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   That's unfortunate in a country with a broken economy and the
elections of a new parliament and president scheduled to take place
in the next 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the so-called ``young reformers'' fired last year from
government amid the country's economic turmoil -- including Boris
Nemtsov and former prime minister Sergei Kiriyenko -- have formed a
loose political coalition that thus far has failed to gather
momentum. They seem to be vying for the relatively sparse
constituency of an existing minority party, the Yabloko headed by
Western-style liberal Grigory Yavlinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But ironically, had she lived, Starovoitova did not appear to
have a niche to fill in today's ambiguous political landscape,
though there was talk she may have been intending to run for the
regional governorship in St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   While popular and prestigious, she had little real power. In
part, Starovoitova was hampered because she was a woman. Men still
hold most positions of power in Russian politics and in this
male-dominated society there is no popular sentiment for that to
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is more of a public, than a real political figure. She
didn't affect anything . . . Galya(CQ) had authority over the
population, but she didn't have the authority to unite them,'' said
Kesselman.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Maybe because she was a women, maybe because she was
(seen as) naive -- today's condition requires a bit of cynicism.''

PRIMAKOV EMERGING AS KREMLIN POWER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ He has cracked down on his enemies, scaled to heights
on popularity polls, and assumed command of Russia's powerful
security forces.
</P>
<P>
   Is Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov ready to challenge
openly the one man still above him, President Boris N. Yeltsin?
</P>
<P>
   Primakov, 69, emphatically denies any intention to replace
Yeltsin before the president's term is scheduled to end next year.
But as Primakov gradually marginalizes the ailing, 68-year-old
Yeltsin, all signs point to an impending confrontation between the
two.
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday, an influential think tank close to Primakov
publicized a program suggesting that Russia's best course lies in
Yeltsin's resignation on health grounds. That move would trigger
early elections in which Primakov, for the first time since he took
office last September, would be the frontrunner, according to a
poll released Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   These two events follow moves over the past month that have
solidified Primakov's position.
</P>
<P>
   First, Primakov won broad support for a ``political stability
pact,'' which essentially mandates that Yeltsin and parliament not
fire him. Then he called for a war against corruption and backed it
up with a series of high-profile raids by riot police against Boris
Berezovsky, a leading businessman and power broker with rumored
ties to Yeltsin's family.
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown was bound to improve Primakov's standing with
ordinary Russians, for whom Berezovsky epitomizes the small clique
of insiders who have grown rich at the expense of the rest of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The power play against Berezovsky also demonstrated Primakov's
control over security forces that previously answered only to
Yeltsin. Primakov has solidified his control over the media,
industry, and national security forces by appointing what one
Moscow newspaper referred to as ``the men in black'' _ former spies
whom Primakov knows from his days as a KGB Middle East specialist
and head of Russia's foreign intelligence service.
</P>
<P>
   Among these ``men in black'' are his chief of staff, Yury
Zubakov, a former comrade in the foreign intelligence service; Yury
Koboladze, the former intelligence service spokesman who is now
deputy head of the Itar-TASS official information agency; and Lev
Koshlyakov, a former KGB general who is in charge of news for state
radio and television.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin has had ambitious subordinates before, but never in his
seven-year presidency has anyone so openly challenged his
supremacy. Anyone who did quickly lost his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Primakov is boldly going where no prime minister has gone
before,'' said Alan Rousso, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov's rapid ascent has defied all expectations. When he was
appointed in September, few saw him as more than a caretaker until
Russia's next presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday's poll of 1,500 Russians by the Moscow-based Public
Opinion Foundation indicated that Primakov would beat any of the
likely candidates for the presidency: Communist leader Gennady
Zyuganov, Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov, Krasnoyarsk Governor Alexander
Lebed, and legislator Grigory Yavlinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Rousso and other analysts are unsure about Primakov's plans.
Is Primakov, a master of Kremlin political intrigue and adviser to
four Soviet leaders dating back to Leonid Brezhnev, preparing a
Soviet-style power play that would eventually force Yeltsin to step
down?
</P>
<P>
   If so, analysts say, Primakov will have to move quickly. He has
temporarily maintained a semblance of stability. But he has failed
to ease the country's huge domestic and foreign debt, chronic
revenue shortfalls, and other woes. But if, as some economists say,
Russia is facing a new bout of hyperinflation, Primakov's
popularity could plunge with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Primakov has an interest in becoming president, he has to
start pushing Yeltsin out now,'' Rousso concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Or is Primakov trying to position himself as the candidate of
choice, or the kingmaker, in 2000? He could even be acting with
Yeltsin's blessing. As Yeltsin has yet to react in public, it is
hard to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is whether Yeltsin has decided that he doesn't
want to be the head of the (Kremlin) anymore,'' commented Sergei
Markov of the Institute of Political Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov has been trying to prevent Yeltsin from making changes
in government with his ``stability pact.'' The plan won support
from the Council on Foreign and Defense Policy, a loose
confederation of leading politicians and businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the Council went further. ``Obviously, Yeltsin's
voluntary resignation on health grounds and the scheduling of new
elections would be optimal for the country,'' the Council's program
asserted.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov quickly distanced himself from the idea of early
elections, perhaps recalling the fate of one of his predecessors,
Viktor Chernomyrdin, whom Yeltsin fired in a surprise move last
March. Unlike Chernomyrdin, who openly coveted Yeltsin's job,
Primakov has consistently denied he wants the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   This is perhaps Primakov's wisest move. As weak as Yeltsin is,
he cannot yet be dismissed. As legislator Yavlinsky recently said,
``He'll still have a cold at your funerals.''

HANDICAPPING THE EMPIRE STATE'S DREAM RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You can hear it in the voice of every local politico
and columnist who brings up the subject _ a tremble of excitement,
a wavelet of giddiness, the palpable thrill that comes with the
hope or dread of witnessing history.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton versus Rudolph W. Giuliani, for the title
of US senator from New York: The notion of such a fight, once the
puffery of daydreams, has suddenly taken on the hard edge of
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Polls, furthermore, show Mrs. Clinton leading the mayor, 51-42.
But these are early polls. Election Day 2000 is still 18 months
away. The question that many are starting to contemplate _ not
least Giuliani and Clinton, neither of whom has yet declared
candidacy _ is what kind of campaign would be involved and whether
she would really win.
</P>
<P>
   Some are skeptical of the flushed optimism displayed by many
Democrats, eager to send one of their own to fill the seat of their
senior senator, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who announced last fall he
would not run for another term.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Mercurio, a leading Republican consultant, said
Wednesday: ``She could become the Geraldine Ferraro of the next
Senate race.'' Ferraro, the TV personality and former vice
presidential candidate, was thought to be a shoo-in when she
entered last fall's Senate race _ and then lost the primary, to
Charles E. Schumer, by 25 points.
</P>
<P>
   Mercurio predicted that, like Ferraro, Mrs. Clinton could start
out ``very big in the polls, partly because of fame. Then she's
fleshed out on issues; she has no set of accomplishments you can
point to, and so she starts to slide.''
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Carroll, head of the Quinnipiac College Polling
Institute, which took the survey showing Mrs. Clinton beating the
mayor, said, ``It's probably true'' that her ratings now are as
high as they will get.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her negatives are plenty,'' Carroll said. She will have to
walk ``a difficult tightrope'' if her husband _ who would still be
president during the campaign _ took a position unpopular with many
New Yorkers. And there is her widely quoted statement of favoring a
Palestinian state, which would alienate many Jewish voters.
</P>
<P>
   John Faso, a Republican state assemblyman, said Mrs. Clinton's
own bag of scandals will be fair game _ her involvement in
Whitewater and the suspiciously quick fortune she once made in
trading cattle futures.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is the carpetbag issue. ``Why should we elect
someone who's never lived in New York?'' Faso asked.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Observer, a weekly paper far friendlier to Mrs.
Clinton, raised the same point in Wednesday's issue: ``What does
she know about Utica and White Plains and the F train?''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, even her critics acknowledge that Mrs.
Clinton would come to the race with many strengths.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost is her fame and popularity. President Clinton enjoys
very high ratings all over the state and his wife seems, if
anything, even more admired. Last fall, when she campaigned for
Schumer in his successful race against the incumbent Republican
senator, Alfonse M. D'Amato, her speeches were big hits at
corporate luncheons and union rallies alike.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Moynihan said ``she'd be welcome and she'd win.''
</P>
<P>
   She would have the strong support of women, without _ at least
so it seems in New York _ alienating many men. The Quinnipiac Poll
shows her leading Giuliani among both genders.
</P>
<P>
   She would have the overwhelming support of minorities, who might
turn out at the voting booths in greater numbers than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats also reject the idea that Mrs. Clinton would be
hurt by being from out of state. ``What did Bobby Kennedy know
about New York?'' former New York Mayor Edward I. Koch asked
rhetorically. Kennedy won the state's Senate seat in 1964 without
living here. ``That's not an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the polls show her creaming Giuliani in New York City _
64 to 31 _ and at least doing well elsewhere, tying him upstate and
trailing by 5 points in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's own popularity may be heading south. A citywide
Quinnipiac poll released Wednesday shows the mayor's positive
ratings declining from 60 percent last November to 44 percent last
week. His negative ratings, over the same period, have gone from 33
percent to 47 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll speculated that the mayor's handling of the Amadou
Diallo shooting _ in which four policemen fired 41 bullets at an
unarmed African immigrant in his own Bronx doorway _ may be partly
responsible for the decline. But he added, ``It's not just Diallo.
It's his whole fortress attitude toward governing.''
</P>
<P>
   John Podhoretz, the conservative editorial-page editor of the
New York Post, said Tuesday night, at a panel on mayoral politics
sponsored by The New Yorker magazine, that Giuliani might not even
run for Senate if Mrs. Clinton entered the race. Asked why, he
replied, ``Because I don't see any way that she doesn't win _ to my
regret.''
</P>
<P>
   However, a Republican with ties to the mayor said Wednesday:
``If Hillary runs, Rudy will be more inclined to run. He will
relish Hillary Clinton. She's unproven, she's never run for office.
Bring her on!''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Giuliani would see the contest as a ``philosophical'' battle, which
he enjoys confronting.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the source said, ``By beating her, he would be one of the
leading, if not one of the top two or three, Republicans in the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican, who also asked not to be identified,
dismissed this as ``tough talk'' and expressed doubts that the
mayor would run in any race that he had a serious chance of losing.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, for some time, has been courting Texas Governor
George W. Bush, a leading prospect for the Republican presidential
nomination, and many have speculated he might prefer being his vice
president or a Cabinet officer. Or he might prefer to wait until
George S. Pataki gets tired of being New York governor and run for
that job. Or he could even wait till 2005 _ four years after his
second and, by law, final consecutive term as mayor expires. By
sitting out four years, he could run for mayor again.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, of whatever stripe, agrees that if Giuliani runs and
Mrs. Clinton does not, then Giuliani probably cannot be beat.
Similarly, if Mrs. Clinton runs and Giuliani does not, then she
probably cannot be beat. This may be another reason why the
politically interested _ eager for drama, if nothing else _ are
hoping that both join up for what would be a battle of titans.

TO CURB FIGHTS, TEACH ALTERNATIVES TO AGGRESSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With 600 students, six recesses, and six lunch periods at the
Mather Elementary School, principal Kim Marshall says that two or
three fights a day are typical. ``With those numbers, flare-ups are
inevitable,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   What sometimes surprises him, however, is that the students who
get into fights are not just those who pose chronic discipline
problems; many of them are students teachers consider ``good
kids.'' Then there's the issue of what prompts a fight: Sometimes
all it takes is being jostled in line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the problem as an inability of children, boys in
particular, not to `step up,' '' says Marshall, using the kids'
jargon in Boston for fighting.
</P>
<P>
   That children fight is nothing new. But stepping up seems to be
heating up all over the country, according to educators and
researchers, and judging by the frequency of media accounts about
shootings by children at schools.
</P>
<P>
   All this raises many questions for parents. Are we raising a
generation of citizens who will not value peace or know how to
engage in peacemaking? Are our schools dangerous? And how do we
talk to our children about fights they witness or are part of?
</P>
<P>
   According to researchers, the answer lies in giving young
children a repertoire of alternatives to physical aggression. The
earlier the better, too. Social behaviors are harder to change
after age 8, according to early childhood educator Nancy
Carlsson-Paige, who researches children's violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that, it's harder for kids to resist the impulse to
fight or know what else to do,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall offers a good example. At recess recently, a
second-grader and a third-grader were ``play-fighting,'' imitating
head and leg locks they'd seen on TV wrestling. ``They weren't
angry; in fact, they were friends,'' he says. But a third child,
``not a troublemaker,'' Marshall is quick to point out, thought the
fight was real and jumped to one child's defense.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, he ripped the child's shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, says Marshall, there was a real fight with tears and
outrage because that child was so angry his shirt was torn.
</P>
<P>
   That it escalated so quickly bothers Marshall. ``We tried to get
the message across that tearing a kid apart was not as good a
solution as working it out and getting a new shirt,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The message was heard, but he isn't sure it was absorbed.
</P>
<P>
   How a child responds to provocation is a combination of
developmental stages and learned responses. Preschoolers, for
instance, lash out physically not only because it is an immediate,
concrete, and satisfying response, but also because they have
little impulse control.
</P>
<P>
   ``One child wants a ball and grabs it from the child who has it.
That child pushes the other. Both fall, both cry, both feel
wronged,'' says Wheelock College professor Diane Levin.
</P>
<P>
   Even with children this young, the adult response sets the stage
for what they will do later. Ascribing blame to the child who
pushed, for instance, can make him angry and resentful. ``What he
learns is that he has to be constantly vigilant to be safe,'' says
Levin. ``Clearly he can't count on the adults; he was infringed
upon and yet he was punished.'' Two or three years later, this
could be the child who interprets a jostle as something he needs to
defend against, she says.
</P>
<P>
   The response Levin recommends is to say, ``It looks like there's
a problem here,'' and to name the problem: ``There's only one ball
and two of you want it, huh?'' Then, she says, be very specific in
helping them formulate alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if what they hear from you is, `Use your words, not your
fists,' they're confused because what they see in the popular
culture glorifies violence,'' says Levin. And even if a 4-year-old
says, `We could share,' it doesn't mean she knows how to implement
sharing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Provide the words: `You could ask, ``Can I have the ball when
you are done?'' ' Show them how to share: `You could share by
rolling it back and forth or you could share by waiting until he's
finished and then having your turn.' '' Levin is the author of
``Teaching Young Children in Violent Times'' (Educators for Social
Responsibility).
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in about third grade, when children are enamored of
the power their words and behaviors have to hurt or exclude peers,
fights escalate from built-up tension. ``You see a lot of this in
fifth grade,'' says Carlsson-Paige, a professor at Lesley College.
Her newest book about dealing with conflict, ``Best Day of the
Week'' (Redleaf Press), is for 4- to 7-year-olds. She and Levin
have coauthored a companion book for parents and teachers, ``Before
Push Comes to Shove.''
</P>
<P>
   If a child comes home and says, ``I was in a fight'' or ``I saw
a fight,'' ``Tell me what happened'' is better than simply, ``What
happened?,'' says Carlsson-Paige. The former shows interest and
concern while the latter is more likely to be interpreted as
judgmental. Once she starts to give you details, reflect back what
you hear without shading it: ``You were feeling like you really
hated Amy . . .''
</P>
<P>
   By middle school, sometimes earlier, what leads to fights has
more to do with posturing and peer group issues than threats.
``Even kids who have skills to resolve conflict without fighting
might succumb to fighting under group pressure. It's a test of
loyalty,'' says Carol Staszewski, who trains teachers on how to
help children deal with conflict through Wellesley College's
``Reach Out to School Social Competency Program,'' also known as
Open Circle.
</P>
<P>
   Staszewski says the strength of Open Circle is twofold: Not only
does it change the culture of the school but it helps children
manage feelings. Only then, she says, can they move into
problem-solving. ``Not `who's right?' and `who's wrong?' but, `We
all get upset, sometimes so upset we feel like hurting someone, so
how do we keep ourselves from doing that?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Students themselves say they don't know how. In a national
Survey on Youth Violence of 1,558 seventh- through 12th-graders,
one-third of the students agreed with the statement, ``When I'm
angry, there is no way I can control myself,'' and 41 percent said
when they are challenged, they will fight.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes what makes them angry is physical provocation _ ``He
punched me!'' _ or a dispute involving a girlfriend. But they also
get angry and fight over nonphysical provocations, like a dis, even
a dis that comes via the rumor mill, says Penelope J. Greene,
director of research at the Center for Health Communication at the
Harvard School of Public Health and lead author of the
Harvard-MetLife Survey on Youth Violence.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but when there is a physical impetus such as
being jostled in line, ``Even though it could easily be an
accident, they act as if there is intentionality,'' says Greene.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy Open Circle promotes is for children to get away or
get help from an adult when a situation seems about to erupt.
Staszewski urges parents to sign on to this strategy but also to
talk with children about other ways to be assertive.
</P>
<P>
   While some parents endorse self-defense, Carlsson-Paige cautions
against blanket approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can acknowledge that hitting back is an option,'' she
says, ``but don't stop there: `Sometimes it's smart to run the heck
out of there. Sometimes it's smart to confront with words or to say
nothing, and sometimes it's smart to hit back.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Staszewski says self-defense is a matter of personal values. Her
advice is that if you want to tell your child, ``Defend yourself if
someone tries to hurt you,'' ``at the very least, talk about how to
gauge the degree of hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting children to be willing to walk away from conflict is no
small task, of course, especially when the culture labels that as a
wimp's way out. A national Harvard-initiated media campaign called
Squash It! may help turn the tide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know there's a disconnect between what kids think they are
supposed to do _ step up _ and what they secretly would like to do
_ have the guts to walk away,'' says Jay Winsten, Squash It!
spokeswoman and associate dean of the Harvard School of Public
Health. The Squash It! gesture of a clenched fist with a flat hand
on top is a way for kids to say: ``This isn't worth it.'' Winsten
says it's gaining popularity in some cities and neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIPS FOR PARENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Children who are frightened by fighting in school need
reassurances about what the school is doing to help. If you think
the school isn't handling it well, talk to the principal and tell
your child you are working to help the school improve. One way is
to set up a parent committee to push for a conflict resolution
curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   --If you take a stand against fighting, don't make an exception
for play-fighting. Even though it's often a way for boys to show
emotion in a culture where you're not supposed to touch, and even
though it's often engaged in affectionately with kids who like each
other, it's easy for someone to get hurt. Besides, it sends a mixed
message.
</P>
<P>
   --Parental modeling influences how children resolve conflict. If
you fight physically, your children likely will, too.
</P>
<P>
   --If your child talks about a fight, it may not be what you
think. Ask him, ``What does that mean, a fight?'' For some kids, a
threatening voice is a fight.

ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE IS THIS MAN'S FORTE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GRIFFITH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Mercedes-Benz first offered 24-hour roadside assistance as
``standard equipment'' on its vehicles more than a decade ago, the
general reaction was, ``Sure, but who's going to make those road
calls on a nice summer Sunday afternoon or, even worse, at 2 a.m.
on a snowy winter's night.''
</P>
<P>
   Say hello to Tom Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he got an award from Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   It was a jacket, a distinctive leather jacket you can't buy.
</P>
<P>
   That jacket signified that he had answered every roadside
assistance call over a four-year period. Four years. 1461 days and
nights (including a Leap Year).
</P>
<P>
   He wears the jacket proudly because he earned it the hard way.
</P>
<P>
   He was called away from New Hampshire International Speedway,
where he was working as part of a racing team. He was called on
Christmas Eve . . . three times. He misses supper at home a couple
of times a week.
</P>
<P>
   Bad enough if that were his main job, but it's not: he's shop
foreman at Dreher Holloway Mercedes in Exeter, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roadside assistance was part of the Mercedes-Benz program,''
said Bacon. ``And they needed someone to cover it.''
</P>
<P>
   Which he's done . . . and done.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Paul Holloway, Bacon's boss, also has been chairman of the
National Automobile Dealers Assn. for the past year.
</P>
<P>
   He recently spent an evening with the New England Motor Press
Assn., sharing a dealer's view on his industry. He talked frankly
about how the internet is affecting sales, about the overcapacity
for production that's plaguing the industry, the impending mergers
of automakers, and the trend to bigger and more factory-dealer
partnerships . . . but in the end it came down to why employees
like Tom Bacon are so important.
</P>
<P>
   ``Programs such as guaranteed roadside assistance are called a
promise of the brand,'' said Holloway.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they're (programs) only as strong as the smallest
independent dealer of that brand,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, Holloway cites an industry problem _ the plight
of the small dealerships that have been targeted by the
manufacturer as ``not viable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They've basically put that dealer in limbo. He can't afford to
retire, and he can't sell his franchise because the banks won't
lend to a buyer if the manufacturer doesn't consider the business
viable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think that dealer is going to have someone available
for roadside assistance 24 hours a day?'' Holloway asked, then
answered his own question. ``I don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``So when a customer breaks down in his area and doesn't get the
assistance, what does he do? He tells everyone he knows that the
system is a crock, and those negative feelings cost you customers
you're never going to regain.''
</P>
<P>
   To Holloway, the Mercedes roadside program has been the most
successful one of its kind in the industry because it's run by
Mercedes and not subcontracted.
</P>
<P>
   So there's little wonder why Mercedes was as proud to present
Mr. Bacon with that jacket as he was to receive it.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly dealerships have come a long way since the horse 'n
buggy days.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But, according to Holloway, those horse 'n buggy days still have
a major impact on how we in the Northeast buy our cars and have
them serviced.
</P>
<P>
   Before the automobile, every neighborhood had a stable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Around here, those stables all became garages, then
dealerships,'' said Holloway.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result some areas of the country _ notably the Northeast
_ are overdealered.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example, he noted that the Boston advertising ADI (area of
dominant interest) has more than 40 Pontiac dealerships while the
Greater Dallas area has four.
</P>
<P>
   What does it mean?
</P>
<P>
   For one thing that newspapers are filled with auto ads by
dealers bashing each others' bumpers over a $50 difference in
price.
</P>
<P>
   And, for another, that the dealer isn't going to make a whole
lot of profit selling you a new car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nationally, dealers made 1.4 percent profit on $508 billion in
car sales in 1997'' That's $200-$300 per car, hardly enough to keep
a dealership rolling.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So how do dealerships survive?
</P>
<P>
   ``They adapt . . . or they're gone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (auto dealership) is a service industry. It's about
building relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   He should know. He's been a successful dealer for more than 30
years, starting with the acquisition of Dreher Buick in 1967 and
now holding Buick, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Chevrolet, Chevy Truck,
Mercedes-Benz and BMW franchises.
</P>
<P>
   ``It starts with the new car sale. Then, you work like hell to
service it (new car).
</P>
<P>
   ``With luck, you'll sell a used car to one of the family's
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, if you've treated the family well over this time,
hopefully they've been telling their friends, neighbors, family and
coworkers and sending you referrals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the value of a customer over a lifetime. It's what
this business is about now.''
</P>
<P>
   It includes millions invested in equipment and people.
</P>
<P>
   For his service department, he exclusively and aggressively
recruits people with AA degrees from Voc Tech colleges.
``Outstanding technicians are worth their weight in gold,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the president of the NADA mentions his man Tom
Bacon in speeches all across the country.

ELBOW INJURY GAVE ROSE A JOLT OF REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ One year and an elbow injury later, Brian
Rose comes to Red Sox camp not in search of stardom, but survival.
</P>
<P>
   At 23, there's plenty of time left to be the hometown hero, even
if it must be a dream deferred. For the native of South Dartmouth,
Mass., the urgency of this spring is defined in much simpler terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it's in Triple A or the big leagues,'' Rose said
Wednesday, ``I want to be healthy, and to see if I can pitch the
way I did in 1997, when I was getting people out and leaving games
with my team ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   The early indications are encouraging. Rose threw off a mound
Wednesday for the second time this spring, all fastballs, no more
than 30 pitches, but he walked away feeling no tightness in the
elbow that betrayed him last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to rush it,'' he said, ``but I don't want to
take it too slow, either, fall too far behind the other guys. I've
been down here since the second week in January, and right now
things are looking pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose did not have surgery, but endured a maddening sequence last
season in which the severity of his injury went undetected by the
ballclub and his willingness to pitch through pain was questioned
by general manager Dan Duquette. It wasn't until Rose went to see
noted orthopedist James Andrews that it was discovered he had a
stress fracture and bone spur that was tugging on the ligament in
his elbow every time he threw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, that was what upset me,'' said Rose, who was originally
diagnosed with an inflamed elbow last May after a start in Texas
and was sent back to Pawtucket on a rehabilitation assignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I needed a second opinion. I know me, and when I'm
facing the same guys I faced the year before and they're telling me
I don't look the same, I knew it had to be one of two things: My
mechanics were really messed up, or there was something wrong with
me. And my mechanics have always been good.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose was so distressed, he said he went up to a player on
another team, Detroit Tiger farmhand Frank Catalanotto, in search
of answers. ``I knew Frank from the (Triple A) All-Star Game, so I
asked him, `What the hell's the difference?' '' Rose said. ``He
told me I didn't have quite the same look, and I wasn't throwing
inside like I had the year before. Now I was almost afraid to pitch
inside.''
</P>
<P>
   When another player in Durham delivered a similar message, Rose
decided he needed another look at his elbow. Andrews found the
stress fracture, and Rose was done for the year. Surgery remains an
option, but so far rest appears to have facilitated the healing
process. Rose paid his own way this winter for Andrews to take
another look, and Andrews reaffirmed the opinion of team doctor
Arthur Pappas that the elbow was mending on its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just needed Andrews to take another look for my own peace of
mind,'' said Rose, a 17-game winner with Pawtucket in 1997 who at
one time, with Connecticut native Carl Pavano, was viewed as a
homegrown hope for the Red Sox rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Pavano made it to the big leagues, but only after he was traded
to the Montreal Expos in the Pedro Martinez deal. He went 6-9 in 23
starts last season for the Expos, but his most notable achievement
was yielding home run No. 70 to Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing wrong with that,'' said Rose, who has remained friends
with Pavano and spoke to him just a couple of days ago. ``He's in
the Hall of Fame _ or at least his glove is.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose made it to the big leagues, too, opening the season in the
Sox rotation, but in his zeal to arrive, he now admits he may have
ignored some warning signs in his elbow last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt funny in spring training,'' he said. ``We kept an eye
on it and kept hoping it would get better, but it never did. It
kept escalating.
</P>
<P>
   ``And me being the rockhead that I am, I'm stubborn. I kept
trying to throw through it, and it didn't work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose made just eight starts for the Red Sox, finishing with a
1-4 record and 6.93 ERA. He made an additional six starts in
Pawtucket, in which he was rocked for 15 runs in 17 2/3 innings,
before shutting it down for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I was afraid,'' Rose said. ``I think my future wife
(high school sweetheart Tara Best) had more faith than I did.''
</P>
<P>
   The anxiety didn't lessen when he tried to throw this winter at
home and developed inflammation in his shoulder. That was to be
expected, since he hadn't thrown in months, but it wasn't until
Rose arrived here last month that the arm responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why, but when I got down here, I felt like a
hundred bucks,'' he said. ``I just felt 100 percent better. Just
getting in the heat helped. Down here, you sweat, man.''
</P>
<P>
   As things stand, Rose figures to start the season back in
Pawtucket. The Sox acquired two veterans this winter, Mark Portugal
and Pat Rapp, to fill out their rotation, and Rose will need some
time to build back his arm strength.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, a return to the minors would have come as a defeat
to the righthander. Not this time. For inspiration, he said, he
looks to veteran Bret Saberhagen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a guy who had total shoulder reconstruction and he was
dealing last season,'' Rose said. ``He didn't just bounce back, he
worked his butt off. That's the type of guy I look up to.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see what he did, that gives you hope.''

FASHION SHOW FEATURES PRINCESSES OF DARKNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA ROBINS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Betsey Johnson doesn't just throw a fashion show.
</P>
<P>
   She gives the very best party, where the hoi polloi rub
everything from noses and elbows to lips and thighs with such
amiable creatures as Amanda LaPore, a ``shemale'' who shows ``her''
assets every moment she can; Frankey the Fabric guy, who does
Johnson's cloth, whose mid-back dreads have been growing for 10
years and who sports a tattoo on his chin; the ``new Carrie'' from
``Carrie II,'' Emily Bergl, who appears in ``The Lion in Winter''
with Laurence Fishburne and Stockard Channing; and Nick Graham, the
brains behind Joe Boxer, who sat in the front row showing off his
white sweat socks.
</P>
<P>
   The show was in the Mercedes-Benz dealership (garage, I
presume), and everything had an eerie green cast to it. Johnson's
name was emblazoned in green neon in a doorway above an expensive
and very black Benz with bright green headlights, and posters for
the ``7 Sisters'' show _ a lovely shade of chartreuse _ were pasted
to the front of the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson sent seven groups of clothes down the runway,
representing her own seven ages of woman, I presume. The whole
collection, including these funereal Morticia Addams weeds, was
very Victorian _ necklines buttoned up to the chin, leg-o-mutton
sleeves, long skirts with hankie hems or tiers of unfinished
flounces.
</P>
<P>
   Very ragbag and quite Gothic, as if these clothes had been
moldering in somebody's crypt for a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Victoriana was mitigated by built-in or strapped-on corsets and
sheer fabrics. Outfits had kicky names like Indulgence and Lust.
And before Johnson sent some sweetness and light down the longest
runway I've ever seen (it must have stretched a whole city block
with 1,000 souls, all dressed in black, squished into seven rows of
chairs plus standing room), she presented her version of The Baby _
short (mid-thigh) baby-doll empire dresses with a macabre twist.
They were mostly black.
</P>
<P>
   These were jumpers over black blouses with white collars and
cuffs, a la Kitty Foyle. (For those who haven't seen that old
weeper on television, Ginger Rogers won an Oscar as the secretary
who fell in love with someone above her station; her signature look
was dark dresses with fresh white collars and cuffs).
</P>
<P>
   After last year's flamenco cocktailers with massive crinolines,
Johnson's fall dresses look drab, especially the flour-sack,
patch-work dresses _ an homage to Dolly Parton's youth? There were
peasant frocks made from thermal letter-printed cotton combined
with tiers of ruffles, as if someone reached into a ragbag and just
sewed.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Johnson presented some pretty, froufrou, honeydew
melon-colored confections with bustles, floaty trains and built-in
corsets ... which still looked Gothic, only without the black.
</P>
<P>
   Models wore hair extensions, kelly-green eye shadow and black
Converse sneaks. They also looked liked they had been in bed for a
week.
</P>
<P>
   As for Amanda LaPore: ``She'' wore fine golden chains, large red
lips and the best pair of breasts that money can buy. Johnson's
frocks would have been an absolutely moot point.

WITH TECHNOLOGY, CHUCK D FIGHTS THE POWER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the words of Cornel West, he's ``a freedom fighter of his
generation.'' In the words of Spike Lee, he's ``one of the most
politically and socially conscious artists of any generation.'' But
forget the superlatives. Chuck D, founder of the rap group Public
Enemy, has roared about the Three E's: education, economics, and
enforcement (as in law). Now he's aiming at another alphabetical
trio, an Information Age version of the three Rs _ record
companies, radio stations, and retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the person who waves a flag for the artists to have a fair
shot,'' Chuck D says during a phone interview from Atlanta. ``The
record companies hide behind bushes when I talk because I'm the
mouth that roars. They're full of `No comments.' ''
</P>
<P>
   His latest rap condemns the music industry. ``If you don't own
the master/then the master owns you,'' the song proclaims,
comparing the artist-industry relationship to slavery. ``Dollar a
rhyme/but we barely get a dime.'' Needless to say, you won't find
record company executives touting the tune, you won't hear it on
the radio, and you won't find it in retail stores. It's available
only on the Internet at www.public-enemy.com.
</P>
<P>
   The provocative song is the latest salvo fired in Chuck D's
dispute with his former label Def Jam Recordings and its parent
company Polygram (now part of Universal Music Group). Now, you
could write this off as a typical artist-management skirmish if it
didn't involve a technological advance that is rapidly changing the
way music is produced, marketed, and distributed. The record
industry is facing its most monumental shakeup, more daunting than
what happened when vinyl gave way to the CD. It's all thanks to a
simple but groundbreaking computer format that rhymes with MTV.
</P>
<P>
   They call it MP3.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial format enables anyone with a modem and a mouse
to download digital copies of recorded music that sound almost
exactly like the originals. It's the hottest thing in cyberspace
these days, and companies like Lycos and JamTV are racing to come
up with products and services as fast as you can say, ``I want my
MP3!'' Depending on who you talk to, though, MP3 is either the
beginning of a brave new world of artistic freedom or a return to
the days when the pirates ruled the seas.
</P>
<P>
   Certain artists (including Public Enemy, Billy Idol, The Beastie
Boys, and the surviving members of the Grateful Dead) are way ahead
of the industry executives, who are scrambling to catch up with the
chaotic, constantly changing world of cyberspace. Public Enemy, for
instance, used the MP3 format to post recordings from its
unreleased remix album on its Web site late last year. Def Jam
demanded that the band remove the songs from the site, and Public
Enemy eventually severed its ties with the label, which has
produced every Public Enemy album since its debut in 1987. ``That
was the straw that broke the camel's back,'' says Chuck D.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the split, a Def Jam spokeswoman said, ``No
comment.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Recording Industry Association of America is hardly
hiding behind bushes. ``With the touch of a button, any 13-year-old
can make music available to millions of people around the world,''
says Cary Sherman, the industry group's senior executive vice
president and general counsel. ``We're talking about a whole new
dimension of piracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck D, however, downplays these fears. ``They're trying to
come up with a two-minute offense,'' he says. ``That's what we say
in football when you're behind and you come up with some rush
plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's the play by play: The recording industry association has
been scouring the Internet to shut down illegal MP3 sites, and in
December, it launched the Secure Digital Music Initiative, or SDMI,
a plan to develop standards to protect copyrighted music in
cyberspace. When the Internet portal Lycos launched an MP3 search
engine last week, the industry association forced the company to
vow it would not link to illegal sites offering bootleg music.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 files, after all, aren't scratchy cassette tapes with gaps
between tracks. They're high-quality recordings. Many Web sites,
including www.mp3.com and www.goodnoise.com, offer legal MP3
recordings to download for about $1 a song; the files are
compressed, so it takes only a minute or so to download a track
using a high-speed modem. Browsers can then play the tunes right on
their computer using one of the free players, such as Real Player,
that are readily available on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 is all the rage among today's technologically savvy college
students, who can easily use ``ripper'' software to copy their CDs
into the MP3 format and distribute it for free _ or for profit _
over the Internet. David Weekly, a 20-year-old Arlington native and
a computer science student at Stanford University, put his entire
music collection up on his Web site two years ago, and his site was
so popular it almost crashed the university's server. He took the
collection down after a representative from Geffen Records
contacted the school.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't have to be a computer science student to use the
technology, and you don't have to be glued to your computer,
either. In December, the first portable device designed to play MP3
files hit the market. Called the Rio PMP300, it's smaller than a
Walkman and retails for $200. You hook it up to your computer and
download your music files into its memory chip. Chuck D's
grandmother could listen to MP3 recordings on a Rio while she's
baking cookies in the kitchen. It's that simple. The device worried
the recording industry association, which unsuccessfully tried to
block its introduction in stores last year.
</P>
<P>
   But Chuck D, whose longtime mantra has been ``Don't believe the
hype,'' thinks the paranoia about the technology is inflated. ``The
big five labels are going to catch up,'' he says. ``They're going
to develop their own supersites, and there will be updated
futuristic record clubs.'' However, he and other artists contend
that the technology can level the playing field, enabling musicians
to control their own work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day of the demo is dead,'' Chuck D says. ``We're going to
have 500,000 labels and a million artists.'' Musicians might also
be able to leverage a better profit margin, more than the usual
dime-per-dollar percentage most artists receive from the major
labels. ``Every artist contract should be 50-50,'' Chuck D says.
</P>
<P>
   The prophet of this new cybernation is putting his modem where
his mouth is. He plans to launch his own interactive label _ one of
the projected 500,000 _ on the Internet. It's called slamjamz.com,
and is due to be up later this month. It will offer albums by such
bands as Hyenas in the Desert and Virus.com.
</P>
<P>
   Slamming the music industry is nothing new to this prophet of
rage, who has blasted record companies for making ``mad loot'' off
young rappers. As it turns out, he's not new to cyberspace, either.
Back in 1994, when most folks thought the Internet was some weird
thing that had to do with MIT and the military, Chuck D and Public
Enemy were aware that a cultural sea change was imminent. Its 1994
CD, ``Muse Sick-N-Hour Mess Age,'' includes a track called ``Harry
Ellis' Interactive Superhighway Phone Call to Chuck D,'' a
manifesto urging musicians to stay in tune with the changing
technology. ``We're talking about a shift in the way this music is
distributed,'' the track warns. ``The music companies are trying to
make sure that . . . they are ahead of the curve.''
</P>
<P>
   The track seemed like a bizarre rambling back in 1994: ``People
were, like, who, what, huh, duh,'' Chuck D recalls. But the
prophesy turned out to be right and wrong at the same time. The
technology has evolved, but it's the musicians who are ahead of the
curve _ so far. It's two-minute defense time for the industry, and
possibly by the end of the year, all the major record labels will
be offering encrypted MP3 songs for sale on the Internet. That's OK
with Chuck D, because the implications of the technology are
daunting. ``It means the beginning of the end of domination,'' he
says, announcing that he's roared enough for now. ``Just boost our
site,'' he adds before ending the interactive superhighway phone
call. That would be public-enemy.com.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chuck D is all over the technology, but that doesn't mean he
wants to give all of his music away free. MP3 provides a great way
to market albums by offering free samples, though, and a handful of
artists have been using it with varying responses from the labels
that own their distribution rights.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Idol, for instance, sold two singles on the popular
www.mp3.com site, but his label, Capitol Records, insisted that he
remove them. Ditto for The Beastie Boys, who received pressure from
Capitol after posting promotional tracks on their Web site,
www.beastieboys.com. Frank Black, formerly of the Pixies, is
selling his latest album in MP3 format at another popular site,
www.goodnoise.com. A few independent labels have jumped into the
fray, too: Salem-based Rykodisc has made 200 tracks available for
purchase on goodnoise.com, and Spin Art is selling its entire
catalog on line.
</P>
<P>
   If any band seems a natural for the technology, it's the
Grateful Dead, which has always encouraged its fans to tape its
concerts and share the goods with fellow Deadheads.
</P>
<P>
   The band, re-formed as The Other Ones in the post-Jerry Garcia
era, recently posted samples and a free single from its upcoming
album (``The Strange Remain'') at www.otherones.evolve.com. But
spokesman Dennis McNally warns that the band isn't eager to see its
music trade hands illegally in MP3 files.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is different from free audience taping because it's
digitally identical to what we recorded,'' McNally says. ``It's a
great marketing tool, but that doesn't mean the Grateful Dead has
decided to give up the rights to sell its music.''
</P>
<P>
   Great marketing tool, indeed. Some 10,000 fans have already
downloaded the free copy of ``Mississippi Half Step.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dead has always been on the cutting edge of technology, but
when it comes to MP3, McNally is ambivalent, bordering on cautious.
``The ramification of digital copying is a headache that's going to
have to be dealt with,'' he says. ``We're watching it with interest
to see how it all works out.''

FOR MAINE TOWN, NO MILL MEANS NO FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILLINOCKET, Maine _ The rambling paper mill by the river gave
birth to this town and for a 100 years its belching smokestacks
have been its steady pulse _ through depression and war, boom times
and bust, moonshine and moonshots.
</P>
<P>
   Like a rich and doting father, the mill paved the roads, built
the schools, paid the bills, and ceaselessly pumped the economic
and emotional current that lit up a proud, sturdy village on the
edge of an enormous industrial forest.
</P>
<P>
   But now, the Great Northern Paper Co.'s tall chimneys are
spewing question marks.
</P>
<P>
   The white smoke hovering high above Millinocket's main street is
either the last gasp of a dying factory that has been a bystander
to the nation's boisterous economic parade, or the early sign of
shaky new life for hundreds of blue-collar workers seeking
investors to help buy the plant and preserve a tradition hewn by
their pioneering grandfathers.
</P>
<P>
   It is an against-the-odds effort that has been replayed in small
towns and big cities across the nation as the United States'
information-age economy makes millionaires on Wall Street, but can
be merciless on aging manufacturing firms that cannot keep pace.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials said it is the first time employees have
sought to buy out a US paper mill, plants that anchor several New
England cities and ride an economic roller coaster tracked to
cyclical paper prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could go off the cliff here,'' said James Hamilton,
president of the mill's plumber and pipe fitter union. ``If we
don't pull this thing together, there's a possibility that the mill
could go down. That's enough to give people daily anxiety. They've
got kids in college and bills and mortgages. It doesn't make for a
pleasant time.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as town manager Paul Bird put it: ``This is a community
under siege. They're proudful people devastated by this news.
Everybody's cycle is wheeled to that mill.''
</P>
<P>
   That mill has stood in the shadow of Mount Katahdin, Maine's
tallest peak, since 1899 when the first roll of newsprint was
produced on a November morning, spit out from a machine powered by
the waters of Millinocket Stream, a tributary of the west branch of
the Penobscot River.
</P>
<P>
   And for the century that has followed, they have made paper in
this town _ and little else. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Mill, town interlinked &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It has always been said that if you didn't work in that mill
you didn't work in this town,'' said Don Raymond, a 44-year-old
computer shop owner who was issued his brown boots out of high
school and worked in the mill briefly. ``Everything is in support
of the mill, right down to the barber shop. Tourists don't come
here for a hair cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``That mill has been so stable for so long that nobody could
fathom it would ever go away. Until last year that is.''
</P>
<P>
   After a succession of owners, Great Northern's latest corporate
parent, South Carolina-based Bowater Inc., announced in January
1998 that it wanted to sell the mill that no longer fit into the
nation's largest newsprint producer's corporate future.
</P>
<P>
   In Millinocket, along a main street already staggered by
incremental cutbacks at the mill, the news of the plan to imperil
850 jobs was met with evolving emotions of denial, frustration,
anger, fear, anxiety, and _ finally _ resolve.
</P>
<P>
   With no known buyer interested in a mill whose newest machine is
27 years old, nine local unions last month signed a deal with an
investment banking firm now working to assemble the mill's
corporate life preserver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you could look at Maine now as being not that
different from Pennsylvania and Ohio 15 or 20 years ago,'' said
David Ehrenfest-Steinglass, an investment banker with American
Capital Strategies.
</P>
<P>
   A Bowater spokeswoman said the deadline for bids passed on
Friday and that the employees' preliminary offer is under study.
</P>
<P>
   American Capital, with $250 million in capital resources, has
helped employees in 28 companies, including those at the Biddeford
Textile Co. two years ago, buy their company by trading wages and
benefits now for a chance of equity in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paper workers are proud people with generation after
generation of making paper in the woods of Maine,''
Ehrenfest-Steinglass said. ``I think they're prepared to do what it
takes to keep the business going. And they particularly like the
idea of owning it.''
</P>
<P>
   During a meeting at a second-floor union conference room last
week, the leaders of Great Northern Paper Co.'s unions made it
clear that they like very little about their plight. The employee
buyout, they said, is a last resort and hardly a buoyant exercise
in entrepreneurship.
</P>
<P>
   Like their grandfathers who followed a narrow, winding, and
muddy road to the woodlands 75 miles north of Bangor, they are in
unfamiliar territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first started, it was like pushing a rock up a hill
with a rope,'' said John Davis, president of the mill's pulp and
sulfite workers union. ``But now, as we go along, I think we can
make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   Making it work will be painful for the union's 659 workers
accustomed to average yearly paychecks of about $38,000. But
confronted with a declining appetite for its product, new
competition from papermakers in Asia and South America, and scant
local capital investment in a business that punishes those who
neglect their machinery, the unions are in a box.
</P>
<P>
   And they know it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a great deal of anticipatory fear in the mill,'' union
leader Hamilton said. ``We just need to have people to have courage
that we're going to do the best we can do and create something that
is going to allow a portion of the people in this area to have
continued employment and enjoyment of the job. And maybe bring new
people in here to raise families and buy some of the houses.''

   TAKE-BOS  
 MILLNOCKET, Maine: ... the houses.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``This is a great at-risk area right now,'' he added. ``This was
very much a family-oriented company before it was invaded by
outside forces.''
</P>
<P>
   That ``invasion'' and the bitterness that accompanies that image
were unthinkable when Millinocket's turn-of-the-century mill, with
eight papermaking machines, was the largest in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Great Northern's first real estate agent, George Stearns, was
responsible for selling the building lots on company lands. He
became chairman of Millinocket's board of selectmen, built the
first schoolhouse in 1901, hired some of the state's best teachers.
Today, the local high school still bears his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my father was alive, you couldn't say a bad word about
Great Northern. I'll tell you it was a damn good company,'' said
Carmen Brigalli, 75, who for 40 years worked at the mill across a
stream from his home in Millinocket's ``Little Italy''
neighborhood. ``When the superintendent used to walk through the
mill, he knew your name. The men in the mill used to go to work an
hour early just to shoot the bull.''
</P>
<P>
   Brigalli said the workers loved their employer back then. And,
he said, the feeling was mutual. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The way it was &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The company sent its heavy equipment to build local playgrounds.
The goalposts at the high school came from a mill machine shop. If
a child got injured, the company airplane was summoned for a free
trip for emergency treatment in Boston. If someone died, the mill
sent a cooked ham and coffee to the wake.
</P>
<P>
   In one year, it paid 72 percent of the town's taxes. At
Christmastime, the company bought and wrapped toy guns for the
town's boys and cute dolls for the girls. It made sure the school's
industrial arts department got new lathes. It built wheelchair
ramps for the handicapped. Once, when workers showed up to retile a
large tank inside the mill, the company sprang for a big buffet
lunch at the Elks lodge and bought beers for the boys.
</P>
<P>
   Schoolboys used to race from high school graduation to the
company's timekeeper in the administration building. The faster the
new graduates would sprint, the higher they would be on the
seniority list. There were jobs for the whole class.
</P>
<P>
   There were two movie theaters and several grocery stores in a
downtown where now there are none. The bars were packed and the
streets crowded on Friday nights ``when people came out of the
woods.''
</P>
<P>
   For the cost of a few cases of Schlitz beer, a new homeowner
could count on the company to send over equipment to dig out a new
cellar hole and pour the cement for the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was to their benefit,'' said James Mingo, a member of the
town's seven-seat council, who worked at the paper mill for 45
years before retiring recently at age 62. ``They needed people
living here for a steady operation. Now, I think people are coming
around to the realization that it's never going to be the same
around here.''
</P>
<P>
   The paper plant here sits on a small rise at the edge of
downtown, a labyrinth of stacks and pipes, ducts and towers.
Inside, where workers produce paper for telephone directories for
companies like Bell Atlantic and for catalogs for mail-order houses
like Victoria's Secret, the place is a hard-hatted nexus of cranes
and winches, of hissing, hot drums.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not their grandfather's paper mill anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tell us we're good at what we're doing and yet they don't
need us,'' said Bob Murray, 50, who went to work at the mill after
he graduated from Stearns High School in 1966. ``That's hard to
swallow.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray, sipping an after-work beer at the downtown Scootic In,
said the pride of worksmanship is slipping and workers have long
stopped debating deeper questions about what the corporation owes
to a little town it created and now threatens. &QL; 
 &QL; 
`People are worried' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Do any of them care? You tell me. Do any of these big
corporations really care?'' Murray asked. ``No one ever dreamed of
this 30 years ago. That mill was going to run forever. We never
thought of this. Who could? I'll tell you, it's nerve-wracking. And
it's affecting a lot of people in this town. People are worried.
They don't know where they're going to be tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Millinocket today is a place where handsome houses that would
fetch $275,000 in suburban Boston sit idle on the market for
$68,000. The population, now 6,000, is aging and declining.
Neighborhood schools have been closed and consolidated. Any flight
into the small local airport sparks another pell-mell round of
rumors about an 11th-hour buyer who might rescue the mill.
</P>
<P>
   The days of the town's housing shortage of the 1950s, of the
annual black-tie papermakers' ball, of the children who would run
into the yard with their father's dinner pails, are now distant,
melancholy memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gone,'' said Vincent J. Brunette, a real estate broker
and the town's part-time assessor. ``It's dead here.''
</P>
<P>
   John F. DiCentes, who went to work in the mill in 1955 and
stayed 39 years until his retirement, said he is not sanguine about
the employee buyout's chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would bet money that it's going to be gone,'' DiCentes said.
``We just don't stand a chance now. I tell people: Get an education
and get out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a union hall downtown, the sons and daughters of men who
raised their families and built their homes on paychecks from the
mill are planning for an uncertain future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a chance to have a say in our future,'' said Eddie
Dempsey, president of the local papermakers union, ``to be the
owners with somebody else in return for some sacrifices.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our best chance,'' Dempsey added, ``is ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   And then he and eight other union presidents excused themselves,
closed their office door, and continued a complex review process
that will decide whether the people of Millinocket can own the mill
they have counted on for a century.

THE UGLY TRUTH: US BOMBED A PHARMACEUTICAL PLANT IN SUDAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Aug. 20, 1998, the United States launched cruise missile
attacks on two targets, one in Afghanistan and one in Sudan. The
target in Afghanistan was a terrorist camp. The target in Sudan was
a pharmaceutical plant.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials maintain that both targets were
part of the ``infrastructure'' of Osama bin Laden's terrorist
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Osama bin Laden is widely believed to have masterminded the Aug.
7 bombings of two US embassies in Africa. US intelligence officials
contend that he and his associates are doing everything they can to
obtain chemical weapons for use against US troops in Saudi Arabia.
US national security policy makers described the strikes on bin
Laden's ``infrastructure'' as both necessary and appropriate,
sovereignty issues notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   About the camps in Afghanistan, we may never know. But about the
pharmaceutical plant in the Sudan, we now know a lot. Almost
everything we know conflicts with the Clinton administration's
stated reasoning for the attack. And the more we learn, the more
disturbing the picture becomes.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to include the Al Shifa pharmaceutical facility on
the target list was a last-minute affair and was based on bad
intelligence and science. The intelligence was frightfully bad. US
officials said that Al Shifa was part of the Sudanese
military-industrial complex. It was not. US officials maintained
that Al Shifa produced no medicinal products. In fact, Al Shifa
produced more than 50 percent of all pharmaceuticals consumed in
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, on almost every important point of fact, the Clinton
administration's description of the facility's operation and
capabilities has been contradicted by independent research. Major
news organizations, including the investigative unit of ABC News
and The New York Times, have reduced to rubble the administration's
claim that Al Shifa was a chemical weapons factory.
</P>
<P>
   US intelligence about the facility was so bad that officials did
not even know that it was privately owned by a merchant banker
named Saleh Idris.
</P>
<P>
   When they found out (from the press), they quickly switched
gears and maintained that Idris was a front man or agent for bin
Laden. There is no evidence that this is true.
</P>
<P>
   Idris, who made his fortune in Saudi Arabia, is now fighting
back. He has engaged the legal services of Akin, Gump in Washington
and the public relations counsel of John Scanlon in New York. Akin,
Gump, in turn, retained Kroll Associates, a private investigative
firm, to conduct two inquiries: one into Idris's background, the
other to look into the ``evidence'' that served as the pretext for
the cruise missile attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Both investigations are now complete, and an executive summary
of the findings has been shared with reporters from The New York
Times, The Washington Post and The Independent in London. Kroll's
investigation of Idris contradicts virtually everything US
officials have said about him. Kroll's scientific investigation,
overseen by Tom Tullius, a BU chemistry professor, found that there
was no evidence that chemical weapons were being developed at the
Al Shifa site and that the ``soil sample'' cited by US intelligence
officials as ``proof'' was, almost certainly, a false positive
reading.
</P>
<P>
   Chemical and Engineering News, the leading US trade publication
in the field, reviewed the Tullius investigation and on Monday will
publish an editorial that is scathing in its assessment of the
government's scientific procedures and protocols. A separate
analysis done by the Defense Intelligence Agency, according to ABC
News, confirms the Tullius investigation's findings.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence mounts of bad intelligence and bad science, US
national security officials have started to add the combustible
element of bad faith.
</P>
<P>
   A high-ranking officer of the National Security Council told The
Washington Post: ``If Akin, Gump would take a look at the State
Department's terrorist list, they'd find Sudan at the top, and they
should think twice about the kinds of clients they are
representing.''
</P>
<P>
   This salvo was ill received at the offices of Vernon Jordan and
Robert Strauss, both of whom are partners at the firm. Jordan and
Strauss have now taken an active interest in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The element of bad faith haunts the Aug. 20 attack on Al Shifa.
Many members of the defense intelligence community believe that the
missile strikes had little to do with global terrorism and
everything to do with the president's pathetic admission, on Aug.
17, of an ``inappropriate'' relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the evidence clearly points to a major mistake in US
antiterrorism policy, the US Senate should appoint an independent
commission to investigate what happened and why.

WINTER TIME A GOOD TIME TO CATCH UP ON WHAT'S NEW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RUTH S. FOSTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What do your friendly landscapers do during winter? Why they go
to professional trade shows and seminars to learn what's new and
how to serve you better. One of my favorites is New England Grows,
which in seven years under executive director Virginia Wood has
become the second largest in the country with 12,000 attendees.
</P>
<P>
   Professional meetings used to be mostly about science. Now they
seem to be more about business and what sells. There's lots of talk
about vertical marketing, which is when big conglomerates,
sometimes multi-nationals, own everything from the farms that grow
the products to the distribution network to the advertising to the
retailers. Nurseries don't grow 100 of a plant anymore, they grow
monocultures of 10,000 and 20,000 to supply these huge retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Branding of plants is a big thing. This means introducing
``new'' plants with a ``special'' name or brand to advertise so
you, the consumer, will remember it. Anything to get you to buy
more.
</P>
<P>
   Branded means identical cookie-cutter plants, produced by the
thousands, that will grow anywhere. The effect will be to limit
horticultural diversity and interesting varieties and to turn
plants into a commodity like bananas or cotton.
</P>
<P>
   These mega-trends mean that small businesses, especially our
farms and nurseries that care about quality and experimentation,
are being squeezed out. I care about them.
</P>
<P>
   To compete they've been advised to expand what they offer.
Specialty foods, local produce, seasonal festivals, hay rides,
pick-your-own pumpkins and raspberries, events that make the trip a
fun outing. Personally, I'm hoping Victoria's Secret will have a
his-and-hers fashion show at my local farm stand.
</P>
<P>
   Another victim of this mega-conglomerate commercialism has been
agricultural funding for university research. Government budgets
have been cut. Corporate money keeps some experimentation alive,
mostly directed to the corporations' bottom lines. But at least
scientists are getting some funding. In Europe, which is ahead of
us, most research is sponsored by businesses. That's why we buy
expensive red, yellow, and orange peppers grown hydroponically in
greenhouses in Holland.
</P>
<P>
   I went with eager anticipation to a scientific lecture titled
``Marvelous Microbes for Managing Malicious Insects.'' We are all
looking to new biological pesticides for safer help with pests.
Unfortunately, several hundred serious professionals, mostly mature
muscular men long active in the landscape business, were treated to
a lecture punctuated with humor more suitable to the professor's
college students.
</P>
<P>
   How these hopeful biological products work was confusing despite
a green handout with enough Latin names to make Linnaeus turn over
in his grave. When, how, and for what each is useful is still being
tested. Biologicals are very specific and have limited windows of
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Biologicals are bacteria, the well known Bts plus other newer
microbes (trade names Conserve, Avid, and Greyhound). Also fungi
(Naturalis, Botaniguard) and nematodes (Ecomask, Heteromask,
Scanmask). You'll be hearing more about them.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that they are still in field trials by many
farmers and nurserymen. Don't spend a pile of hopeful money on them
yet. But if you do want to try some (which I have been doing), grow
some control plants without them. I'd be interested in your results
if you'd be kind enough to put them on a postcard. If I get a lot
of results that seem to indicate usefulness, I'll report it to you
all.
</P>
<P>
   I went to another lecture on industry trends. That university
handout commented, ``Color will always sell.'' People buy flowers.
So stores carry plants in flower. Now you may think they will
become permanent houseplants, but unless you have a greenhouse,
they are more a substitute for cut flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Catch you on a whim? They caught me. I have some miniature rose
plants from my local supermarket, which I grabbed with the potatoes
one dreary winter day. They were covered with red buds that never
opened.
</P>
<P>
   A commercial grower from Canada explained to me that most
flowering plants won't get enough light in a house in winter for
the buds to open. In his greenhouses they are grown under sodium
vapor lights, and his roses take three months to come into bloom.
</P>
<P>
   The flowers on rose plants should be open when you buy them.
They'll last two to three weeks, then they should be cut back and
new growth will come. (Mine have new growth.) When the weather
warms, they can be planted out in the garden like regular rose
bushes (April in Zone 5 around Boston). With monthly fertilizer and
regular deadheading, they should produce a new flush of flower buds
about every 30 days. And with proper winter protection, they should
overwinter. So says the Canadian grower. We'll see.
</P>
<P>
   I always like to glean tips from these knowledgeable
professionals. Chrysanthemums, when bought, should have open
flowers, too. Buds less than the size of a quarter won't open in
ordinary house light.
</P>
<P>
   Cyclamen should also have three or four open flowers and lots of
buds when you buy them. Why do mine always do poorly? He said I
should water from the bottom and don't rot the tubers with
overwatering.
</P>
<P>
   Kalanchoe, like chrysanthemums, needs short days, which is why
it, too, should be bought with flowers. It will keep flowering once
bud set is triggered. Hibiscus can be kept alive during northern
winters but generally won't bloom except in a very, very sunny
window or with lots of supplemental light.
</P>
<P>
   In the landscape industry, one of the biggest problems is a bad
shortage of labor. Landscaping is hard work, and few strong young
men are into digging holes these days.
</P>
<P>
   So there are more and more machines that dig and do chores.
Forget sweeping with a broom, the labor saving power blower is in.
And with all this noisy machinery, more and more communities are
legislating ordinances on noise and air pollution from the multiple
machines.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, you'll see lots of advertising, all geared at the
media (me) to get to the consumer (you), to get you to want to buy
more. You have to give credit to Martha Stewart, the ultimate media
seductress. On TV she shyly murmured that hydrangeas were ``a good
thing'' and they sold out all over the country. If the muscular men
left in landscaping turn to Martha's model, heaven help the poor
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the bottom line for all of us in the big purchasing
pool of garden goodies? It's probably Buyer Beware of the Hype. Buy
locally grown stuff when you can, both for better quality and to
keep our local agriculture alive. And while you're at it, enjoy the
pies, bread, ice cream, and entertainment at your friendly family
farms, nurseries, and garden centers.

GETTING A JUMP ON SPRING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROL STOCKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's almost two months until daffodils trumpet the end of
winter, but you can get an advance taste of spring by checking out
a flower show or greenhouse, or by working on landscape plans.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The flower show season in New England begins with the opening
of the Rhode Island Spring Flower &AMP; Garden Show, running through
Sunday, Feb. 21, at the R.I. Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   Though the March 13-21 New England Spring Flower Show at the
Bayside Exposition Center in Boston is still the region's biggest,
oldest, and best, the six-year-old Providence show is one of almost
a dozen upstarts that have sprouted in the hinterlands and is
well-timed for anxious gardeners. (See sidebar)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before you get busy sowing seeds, this is the time to assess
your most important plants: trees.
</P>
<P>
   Last year was hard on them. After a terrible ice storm in the
north, a quirky spring caused frost damage, followed by unrelenting
rains that spawned fungus problems for dogwoods and maples. When
this was followed by pear thrips, canker worms, and a droughty
summer, maples and some other trees started dying.
</P>
<P>
   So take a good look at your trees this year. If you had a lot of
branch dieback last year, mulch and fertilize this spring, and
water through the summer.
</P>
<P>
   If you were terrorized by millions of canker worms that denuded
your trees last year, then dangled into your yard, this is the time
to call an arborist about spraying, before eggs hatch and you get a
repeat attack that could finish off your maples. Always make sure
to hire an arborist with a pesticide license and insurance for any
pesticide work or spraying.
</P>
<P>
   Ash trees are suffering from the mysterious ``ash yellows'' or
``ash dieback.'' The best thing is simply to keep them well-watered
as this is really a wetland species that has suffered during recent
summer droughts.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious scourge tree lovers face, however, is the
hemlock-killing woolly adelgid. These tiny white aphidlike insects
from Asia are now showing up and in Massachusetts and southern New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Hemlock owners who find white woolly rows of the tiny insects
lined along the undersides of hemlocks where the needles join the
branches face the difficult choice of letting the tree die or
hiring a certified arborist for expensive treatment.
</P>
<P>
   I owned a single afflicted hemlock and paid a tree company $250
to inject the soil around it with the new pesticide, Merit, which
has a 100 percent kill rate for woolly adelgid. My hemlock has been
cured for three years now, but if it gets reinfected from
``blow-ins,'' I'll have to pay for another treatment.
</P>
<P>
   A cheaper though less effective response is spraying with
horticultural oil, which will also smother rust mites, pests that
turn needles yellowish and are not killed by Merit. This may be a
better bet if you own several hemlocks, and will cost about $125
for an average yard.
</P>
<P>
   But you may not have to pay for hemlock treatment forever.
Scientist Mark McClure of the Connecticut Agricultural Experimental
Station has already tested and released thousands of imported
ladybugs that eat woolly adelgids in Connecticut, Virginia, and New
Jersey. Massachusetts may get some this year. But it will take
years for the ladybugs to spread to all the affected areas,
assuming all goes according to plan. Meanwhile, these insects can
kill a tree in three years. So I think of spraying or inoculating
afflicted hemlocks as keeping the patient on medication to prolong
life until doctors deliver the cure.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian hemlocks, American dogwoods, and white ash are trees to
avoid planting now (nota bene builders of new homes). What are some
alternatives?
</P>
<P>
   The Leyland cypress is worth trying as a Canadian hemlock
substitute south of Boston. Yews are shade-tolerant evergreens but
small and slow-growing, as are blue hollies (see below).
</P>
<P>
   Kousa dogwoods and the new Rutger hybrids between Kousa and
Cornus florida are substitutes for the much-loved but
disease-devastated traditional dogwood, as is the cornelian cherry.
If you have trouble with fruit tree diseases, entomologist Donald
Booth of the Bartlett Tree Co. recommends planting Asian pears,
especially the Shinko variety. Cross-pollinators are usually
unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We have such a long dormant season that we need to plant for
winter interest first,'' said Michael J. Arnum of the Worcester
County Horticultural Society's Tower Hill Botanic Garden. This,
plus disease resistance and cold hardiness, are key criteria for
selecting this year's Cary Award-winning plants.
</P>
<P>
   They include (drumroll, please) the cornelian cherry dogwood
(Cornus mas), a 20-foot-tall, disease-resistant dogwood that
produces tiny yellow flowers in late March, making it one of our
earliest bloomers. Exfoliating foliage also provides winter
interest and late summer berries attract birds.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Princess and Blue Prince holly (Ilex x meserveae) are truly
great plants and good candidates for an evergreen hedge in sun or
partial shade; they grow slowly to 15 feet. Hollies have genders
and you need one Blue Prince to pollinate all your Blue Princesses,
which will reward you with decorative red berries in time for
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Bearberry (Arctostaphylos uva-ursi) is a fine evergreen ground
cover with flowers and fruit that tolerates salt spray and thrives
on the sandy beaches of Cape Cod.
</P>

Cary Award highlights several plants each year chosen by a blue

<P>
   An automatic back-seat driver is being tested by researchers in
Germany. But rather than nagging and telling the driver to slow
down on empty roads, this back-seat driver can take control of the
car and maneuver it out of danger.
</P>
<P>
   Having taken charge of the accelerator, brakes and steering, the
intelligent car drives autonomously in urban traffic and will even
indicate when it is about to change lanes. If the driver wants to
regain control, he/she simply has to grab the wheel and start
driving again.
</P>
<P>
   Basic automatic ``co-pilots,'' such as the Distronic system in
the S Class Mercedes, are already on the market. But these simply
regulate the distance between cars and have no control over the
steering. And this sort of system is limited to motorway driving,
where there is more room to maneuver and there are clearer road
markings.
</P>
<P>
   The new system, developed at the Fraunhofer Institute for
Information and Data Processing in Karlsruhe, is meant to cope with
busy urban conditions. Andrew Plummer, a mechanical engineer at
Leeds University who was recently given a grant by BMW-owned Rover
to build an intelligent car, says this type of driving is
particularly challenging. ``It's the most difficult environment
because there's so much going on,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   What makes urban conditions so difficult, says Frank Heimes, the
co-pilot's engineer, is that it is not always obvious what counts
as a road lane. Other drivers frequently ignore lane markings,
which can obscure them and can sometimes make them redundant.
</P>
<P>
   The Fraunhofer car overcomes this problem by ``going with the
flow.'' To avoid complications it simply stays in line with the
other cars, speeding up when they do and slowing or stopping when
necessary. A result of this, Heimes says, is that the car won't
automatically observe speed limits.
</P>
<P>
   Two microprocessors figure out where the car is at any time, in
relation to other cars and to the boundaries of the road. To do
this the car uses stored 3-D models of what different types of road
_ such as intersections, two-lane and three-lane roads _ should
look like, as well as cars, trucks and pedestrians. By comparing
images captured by two forward-facing cameras with models in its
database, the computer works out where the car is and what vehicles
and people are around.
</P>
<P>
   The test system has its weaknesses, not least the fact that it
depends on a database of ideal roads of specified widths. The
system also works better at slow speeds. ``But humans have their
weaknesses too,'' Heimes says.
</P>
<P>
   He says it will be a long time before we see such vehicles on
the road, because the electronics are still too big to fit in most
of today's cars. That's not the only obstacle: In many countries,
the law would have to be changed. In Britain, for example,
automatic control of steering and brakes is illegal _ and drivers
would still be liable for any accidents. &QL;

SIGRID OLSEN: ON THE BRINK OF FASHION FAME

 By SUZANNE C. RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's 9 a.m. and the city is fogbound, but designer
Sigrid Olsen is grinning ear to ear.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve models are parading her clothes on a runway, and editors
from Vogue, Allure, and Mode are in the audience for Wednesday's
unveiling.
</P>
<P>
   It's a thrilling moment for her, since this is her first New
York fashion show as a member of the prestigious Council of Fashion
Designers of America. ``This is a huge step up,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   No kidding. Many lesser-known fashion houses would have no hope
of drawing such important editors to a first show during Fashion
Week, especially since Ralph Lauren is showing his fall collection
across town in less than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   But Olsen has become a fashion force. Her clothes are hot. (She
sold $60 million worth last year to stores such Bloomingdale's and
Nordstrom's.) And the woman is savvy: Last month she agreed to sell
84.5 percent of her Wakefield, Mass. company, Segrets Inc., to Liz
Claiborne Inc. Olsen will remain creative director.
</P>
<P>
   The sale makes Olsen one of the Boston area's most successful
designers ever. With Claiborne as a financial partner and an
experienced adviser, Olsen can increase her production,
advertising, and purchasing power exponentially. ``I hope we become
a household name eventually,'' says the 45-year-old divorced mother
of two.
</P>
<P>
   That appears likely. At Olsen's show Wednesday (which was almost
a coming-out party), Claiborne's chairman and chief executive
officer Paul Charron and president Denise Seegal seemed almost
giddy about the deal. ``We're absolutely thrilled,'' said Seegal.
``We've been watching her for about four years. She has an
unbelievable sense of colors and fabrics.'' Added Charron, ``Sigrid
is a very talented woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Fashion editors at the show were equally excited. ``I think her
clothes are great,'' said Samira Nasr, market editor at Allure.
``They're simple, easy, and'' appealing to ``so many different
women,'' said Gretchen Gunlocke, market editor at Vogue.
</P>
<P>
   So who is Sigrid Olsen? Fifteen years ago, she was a Rockport,
Mass. artist making potholders, quilts, and T-shirts using fabric
she'd hand-printed with stamps made from potato wedges. Working out
of a cooperative craft gallery, she mixed her paints in egg cartons
and sold her goods to the public and to five specialty stores. Her
lifestyle was anything but glamorous.
</P>
<P>
   But with the encouragement of business partner Peter Wagner,
Olsen began to grow her wearable-art business in 1984. She hired a
New York factory to silk-screen her fabrics rather than print them
herself. A Worcester, Mass. factory sewed samples of her casual
resort wear, and Wagner organized a national sales force to place
the goods in specialty stores in Massachusetts, Florida, and
California. An Asian factory then produced the clothes. Gradually,
she expanded her efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, with an influx of money from another investor, David
Peipers, Olsen was able to hire more staff, expand her clothing
line, open a showroom in New York (for retailers to come and see
the line), attend trade shows, and advertise. By the late 1980s,
her company, called Segrets Inc., secured its first major account,
Nordstrom's. Macy's West soon followed. Its specialty store
distribution _ which accounts for half of its sales _ now includes
more than 1,500 stores in the United States, Canada, the United
Kingdom, Germany, and Scandinavia.
</P>
<P>
   Just call Olsen a poster girl for the motto ``Do what you love,
and the money will follow.'' Growing up in Connecticut and New
York, the designer _ whose father was a painter _ says, ``I've been
an artist since I was old enough to hold a pencil.''
</P>
<P>
   In her eighth-grade yearbook, she wrote that she wanted to
become a textile designer. That's why, in the early 1970s, Olsen
moved to Massachusetts to attend the Montserrat School of Visual
Art (now called the Montserrat College of Art) in Beverly. She
majored in painting and printmaking.
</P>
<P>
   Olsen says her $40 to $200 clothes (divided into work and
evening wear, sportswear, and jeans labels) are unusual because
they're ``art-driven.'' In an age of fashion minimalism, her
fabrics are textured, colorful, or decorated with prints. ``All my
clothes work together to create a vision,'' she says. ``It's like a
painting . . . I'm still an artist.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, her 1999 spring line being shown in New York this week
includes a plum floral dress suitable for a party, a sky-blue
wraparound skirt in Indian print appropriate for a casual
workplace, and a pink and purple-striped chenille cardigan with
coordinating jeans useful for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many designers, Olsen doesn't do much of the sketching
for her clothing line. As creative director these days, she's more
like a CEO. She decides the direction of each collection: whether
the silhouette will be soft or hard, long or short, tailored or
loose. She collaborates with five staff designers on colors and
fabrics, and works with an outside studio on print designs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't design the prints myself,'' she says. ``But I will
change the colors, spacing or'' pattern ``size. So I'm still
interpreting as a designer.''
</P>
<P>
   Olsen splits her workweek between New York City and her
Wakefield headquarters, which has 70 employees. In New York, her
typical day includes in-store appearances, lunches with magazine
editors, and meetings with her advertising and public relations
staff. The high-energy Olsen might observe a photo shoot for an ad
campaign or meet with retail customers in her showroom. Her 10-hour
days usually conclude with a charity dinner or a cocktail party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight, I'm going to a Glamour magazine party for its first
issue with Bonnie Fuller,'' the magazine's new editor, she said
last week. ``I'll go and stay about 45 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   In Wakefield, Olsen _ who despite her love of color, tends to
dress in all black _ focuses on design and is much more low key.
``There's something about being outside of New York that keeps us
calmer,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Olsen's 17-year-old daughter lives with her in Cambridge, Mass.,
along with a nanny. Her 20-year-old son lives in Vermont. ``Neither
of them is interested in the business,'' she says. ``My son is into
computer design,'' graphics and digital imaging, ``and my daughter,
acting.'' The designer says her daughter is ``my muse. If she
thinks something is cool, I know it's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering the size of Olsen's company, you'd expect her
wardrobe to be immense and date back years. But the 5-foot-6-inch
blonde keeps her closets updated; they always feature only clothes
from her most current collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``My closet cleaning episodes are legendary,'' she says. Three
times a year, she dumps a huge pile of clothes on her living room
floor and leaves her door unlocked when she leaves for work. ``My
sister and friends come and have a ball,'' she says. Alas, they
have to stay trim. Olsen wears a sample size _ 6 or 8.
</P>
<P>
   In her new relationship with Claiborne, Olsen concedes that
there will be pressure to increase sales. Indeed, Claiborne has
already said it hopes to make Segrets a $200 million company in
five years. But the creative director isn't worried. ``We already
had an ambitious sales plan,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``My ultimate goal is to continue developing my talents as a
designer and expand my horizons in terms of the kind of product I
develop, whether it's accessories or home furnishings. I want to
grow the brand and become well known while holding on to the
integrity of who we are.''
</P>
<P>
   She'd even like to pick up those potato wedges again. ``I
definitely would like to go back to doing art,'' she says. ``I'd
like to get back in the studio.''
</P>
<P>
   But first things first. ``I'm having fun here,'' Olsen says,
after air-kissing several fashion editors after Wednesday's show.
``The art can wait.''

STYLE MAG TELLS ALL FOR IVANA-BES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The multimedia entrepreneur formerly known as Ivana Trump has a
glossy new lifestyle magazine, ``Ivana's Living in Style.'' I say
``formerly known as Ivana Trump'' because she seems to have dropped
the surname and now goes simply as Ivana, as befits her superstar
status.
</P>
<P>
   Ivana doesn't need The Donald connection anymore, which must
delight her. She's now a tycoon in her own right. She's on QVC
hawking her House of Ivana clothing, jewelry, scents, shoes,
cosmetics, etc. She collaborates with ghostwriters on novels and
nonfiction. She lends her name to an advice column, ``Ask Ivana,''
in the tabloid weekly Globe. Now she's given us her magazine, so we
can aspire to emulate Ivana's sense of style.
</P>
<P>
   There's so much to love about ``Ivana's Living in Style.'' Where
to begin? Perhaps with a question she puts to several men,
including ``Count Roffredo Gaietani (my boyfriend).'' Ivana asks:
What do men really want women to wear? The count replies, ``I've
always loved the elegant miniskirt, especially on girls with
fabulous legs like Ivana's.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivana is a perennial girl, even though she must be pushing 50.
But it's not enough just to have the elegant miniskirt, you must
also have the sexy shoes. In a story titled ``Fancy Footwear:
Killer Heels and How to Wear Them,'' Ivana answers all those
questions you've been longing to ask about the dos and don'ts of
wearing 4-inch stilettos. Here's one of her handy tips: Don't wear
spike heels to outdoor events. ``If there is grass or sand in
sight, you will sink faster than the Titanic and there's always a
chance you'll become landlocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivana shares more of her wisdom in another story, ``Picture
This! How to Look Great in a Photo.'' The piece is lavishly
illustated with photographs of Ivana, but then the entire magazine
is a photographic tribute to its creator. I counted 56 photos of
her in 84 pages. Well, no one has ever accused her of being
camera-shy. Obviously she knows how to pose. Here's an invaluable
piece of advice from ``one of the most photographed women in the
world:'' If someone is pointing a camera at you, try not to smile
and eat at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite feature in ``Ivana's Living in Style'' is ``The Joy
of Not Cooking.'' With this story Ivana stakes a persuasive claim
to being the anti-Martha Stewart. It's an illustrated guide to
passing off takeout as your own homemade. Really, you have to love
the woman.
</P>
<P>
   The main trick, according to Ivana, is knowing how to arrange
takeout food attractively. She suggests appropriate garnishes for
Chinese, Mexican and Italian takeout. She also offers ``10 Takeout
Tips'' for fooling your guests. Number 4 seems crucial: ``Destroy
the evidence. Hide takeout containers really well and make sure
they're not visible if your guests open the garbage can.'' I also
like tip number 9: ``Don't make any `mmm' sounds or exclaim, `This
food is delicious.' You're supposed to be feigning modesty over
your wonderful home cooking.''
</P>
<P>
   All in all, ``Ivana's Living in Style'' outstripped my fondest
hopes for it, which is saying a great deal. But I was a little
disappointed, too. Like so many women, I have wondered how, with
all her money and all her resources, Ivana manages to look so . . .
well, to look the way she does. I didn't feel that the magazine
provided much insight into the wellspring of Ivana's peculiar sense
of style.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a tantalizing insight into the how, if not
the why, of her fashion sense in a feature titled ``Ivana Look Like
You!'' in which she shows readers how to acquire her look at
bargain prices. Ivana is pictured modeling her own black minidress,
an Oscar de La Renta number that goes for $1,950. On a rack beside
her is another little black frock, from Victoria's Secret, for $99.
Here's a clue to the mystery of Ivana's style. She knows how to get
that cheesy Victoria's Secret look at haute couture prices. Thanks,
Ivana, for sharing.

HOW TO REMOVE STAINS FROM A BRICK FLOOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Two of my floors are antique brick in a nice herringbone
pattern and mortared. It is a fine floor, but it gets a lot of
stains. You name it and it has been on my floor: peanut butter,
jam, coffee, tea, cake, bread, butter, oleo. I tried Simple Green
without success. TSP and water also didn't work for me, even when I
used a wet vac to take up all the water. How can I clean that floor
and, equally important, how can I keep it clean?
</P>
<P>
   E. H., Atkinson, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   A. If the brick has not been sealed in any manner, then cleaning
stains will be doubly difficult. But we Americans don't use our
cleaners properly. We scrub our floors with all kinds of cleaners,
but are not quite satisfied. That is because we do not let the
cleaner do its work to dissolve the dirt and stains. This is what
to do: Make a double-strength solution of TSP or Spic and Span and
water, apply this heavily to the floor, and let it sit there for
several minutes. Then scrub, and take up all liquids with the wet
vac.
</P>
<P>
   This will at least clean the brick, but may not remove all the
stains, particularly if they are oily. The only way to get oily
stains out is to apply paint thinner, then add generous amounts of
baking soda to absorb the thinner and the stains.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if the bricks are reasonably clean, you can seal them
with a masonry sealer or tile sealer, which will make the bricks a
little more water resistant and therefore stain resistant.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My one-piece, steel bulkhead with sides, steps, bottom, and
doors at the top is beginning to rust out, and it leaks like a
sieve when it rains. What can I do to stop the leaks?
</P>
<P>
   CARL DOUHAN, Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Those steel bulkheads are great when new, but steel does not
last very long in such a situation, and even faithful maintenance
in keeping it painted will not help much. Make a proper repair by
digging it out and replacing it with an all-concrete (except for
the doors) bulkhead that can be dropped in the original opening
with a minimum of adjustment. If you do this, hope that the
connection betweeen the bulkhead and the foundation is tight; that
is where most bulkheads leak.
</P>
<P>
   A temporary expedient if you leave the steel unit in place is to
cut through the steel bottom and dig a hole as big as the area at
the bottom of the steps and about 12 inches deep. If the water
level underground is not too high, this hole _ a sump, really _
will collect and absorb water as it comes in, and prevent it from
flooding the basement floor. If this works, you can postpone
replacing the bulkhead.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. We plan to put in a new Corian countertop in our kitchen. Are
there any negatives about this material as a countertop?
</P>
<P>
   MARGARET &AMP; JOHN BRENNAN, Massachusetts
</P>
<P>
   A. No negatives, on Corian and its competitors, in my opinion,
except cost. It is expensive. I speak from experience, having
owning two Corian vanity tops for at least 10 years. Corian resists
absorption of stains and anything else, and stains and other
blemishes can be sanded off with fine sandpaper or emory cloth.
Scratches can also be sanded off with no adverse effects; it will
take a little longer to eliminate scratches. You can use cleansers
or abrasive pads, but these will take even longer. Chips, I
believe, can be filled with a liquid repair solution and sanded
smooth.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am having my hardwood floors refinished. The refinisher
said he specializes in moisture-cured polyurethane. Is it good?
</P>
<P>
   SHEILA STEMPECK, Reading, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Is it good? I think it is the best onsite finish you can get.
Jim Richards, who heads up Marco Products of Marblehead, Mass.,
says his product (ASTM Type II moisture-cured aliphatic
polyurethane) is the best. It is rarely if every applied by the
do-it-yourselfer because it is very toxic and unhealthy to be
around as it cures. Because of its toxicity, it is suggested the
homeowner leave the house for a few days while the material is
installed.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Toilet stains seem to plague everyone, and there are so many
so-called cures out there that it's difficult to make a choice, or
to tell which is better.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what E.I. found for the stains: Pumice on a Stick, in
the Vermont Country Store catalog. You can also buy pumice blocks
in hardware stores. To use the stick or block to abrade the stain,
rub and rub and rub some more. To treat stains under water, drain
the toilet first by closing the intake valve to the tank and
flushing. Rubbing with pumice may dull the vitreous china of the
toilet, but will do no harm.

FREEING THE MIND TO HEAL THE BODY 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My friend Christina went to see her oncologists, reconciled to
having an operation to remove her tumor, along with one kidney, as
a way of dealing with her fourth recurrence of cancer. When she
next spoke with her doctors, however, they informed her that they
were planning chemotherapy, perhaps to be followed by a colostomy.
</P>
<P>
   Taken by surprise, she felt overwhelmed and angry, as if her
thoughts and feelings had no place in her treatment. It was as if
the intuitive self she'd always counted on for guidance was
confused and off center. More than medical treatment, she felt the
need to sort out her feelings and to deal with the emotional
aspects of her illness.
</P>
<P>
   She decided to spend two weekends working with healers, one in
Toronto, one in Michigan, whom friends had recommended. Through the
use of visualizations, a sweat lodge ceremony, and past-life
regressions, she tried to make sense of what was happening to her.
She discovered that she was living with a deep sense of being a
victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``It suddenly became clear to me that all my life I've lived
with a sense of not being good enough for those who are important
to me,'' she reports. ``The man in Canada asked me, `When are you
going to stop trying to please other people? You've been hanging on
that cross, making a martyr of yourself, long enough. Get yourself
off before it kills you.' And I started to wonder, `Why do I push
myself so hard? Why don't I allow myself to have more fun? I'm so
exhausted from this life. Do I really want to live?' ''
</P>
<P>
   She desperately wanted to be able to answer those questions.
</P>
<P>
   When she began working with the woman in Michigan, Christina
came across a belief she'd never consciously acknowledged before,
her conviction that someone was out to get her. When she visualized
her cancer, she saw it as a malevolent ``curse.'' When she imagined
who might have cast this evil spell upon her, she identified an
entity within herself as a ``cursing lady.'' With shock, she
recognized it as the part of her mother that had often referred to
Christina as ``the nail in my coffin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She was tough to get rid of,'' Christina says. ``My mother
felt unloved and isolated. I was my father's favorite and so I
became my mother's whipping post. In order to please her and win
her approval I took on her burdens in the world. I decided I would
make her happy and protect her, the role I've played with many
people in my life, thinking that someday I would finally be
affirmed as lovable.''
</P>
<P>
   As we all discover, that kind of someday is always out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   The healer pointed out Christina had a choice. The cursing lady
could not remain without Christina's permission. ``As a child, you
allowed that entity to have a hold on you, but you're not
necessarily at her mercy. Your body is your secure space. You can
choose to be free of her.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had times I was so scared that I said, `God, you have to
come stand by me. I can't stand alone,' '' Christina recalls. But I
finally found the courage to confront that demon and say, ``Thank
you for whatever good you've done, but you are no longer welcome
here.'' When this symbolic exorcism was over, Christina felt free
for the first time in her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel perfectly OK about having chemotherapy now,'' Christina
says. ``Nineteen ninety-nine is going to be my year of health. I'm
going to go for it because I'm finally out of shackles. For the
first time I feel that I deserve my freedom. Now I want to live in
this freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   These are Christina's plans for the future. Between now and May,
she's going accept treatment for her cancer, not as a reluctant
victim, but as someone who is actively choosing to become healthy.
As the owner of a home furnishing business, she's rethinking her
career goals. She's going to replace the press of obligations with
the pleasure of speaking her mind, replace pleasing others with
listening to her own heart. She's always wanted to be an artist.
She's always dreamed of living on a houseboat in Sausalito. She's
always hoped to find a man who would love her for her true self.
Now she feels, for the first time, that she has a responsibility to
choose to follow her dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always knew that death wasn't the problem,'' she says. ``The
real problem is how to live every day of your life. When you reach
this degree of clarity in your life, you have faith that the
universe will be there to support you.'' She smiles, her eyes
meeting mine. ``I'm willing to trust that if I do my part, the rest
will come knocking on my door.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In last week's column, it was stated that air pollution
increased the risk of cancer by 1 in 10,000 per year. According to
the EPA, that is a lifetime, not a yearly, risk.

<P>
   Hostility to genetically modified food has exploded in Britain
amid claims that it is being rammed down the public's throat
without proper safety testing. At the center of the storm is a
researcher who argues that genetically engineered foods could
create unforeseen hazards.
</P>
<P>
   At face value, Arpad Pusztai's findings cast a pall over the
entire genetically engineered food industry. His results, obtained
at the Rowett Research Institute in Aberdeen, suggest that
procedures routinely used in genetic engineering can make plants
harmful. The British public and media are up in arms.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Pusztai's data remain mired in confusion. His claim that
rats are harmed by eating a particular kind of genetically
engineered potato has yet to be confirmed. And even if the potatoes
are harmful, this may not have any relevance to genetically
engineered crops approved for sale. Any ill effects could have been
caused by something specific to the transgenic potatoes he used _
which were never intended for human consumption _ rather than the
process of genetic engineering itself.
</P>
<P>
   Pusztai was trying to discover if a protein taken from snowdrops
could harm rats when fed to them in potatoes. Several labs are
investigating whether the gene for this protein, which is of a type
known as a lectin, could be added to crops such as rice to make
them resistant to sap-sucking insects. So data on its safety are
important.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Pusztai's rats were fed ordinary potatoes laced with the
lectin. Others ate potatoes genetically engineered to make the
lectin themselves. A control group of rats ate ordinary potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Pusztai found differences in the size of several organs in young
rats eating the transgenic potatoes, and evidence of damage to
their immune systems. Rats eating the lectin-spiked potatoes showed
no such effects, he claims, suggesting that something other than
the lectin caused the damage. One suggestion is that the problem
lies with what genetic engineers call the ``construct'' _ the
package of DNA introduced along with the foreign gene.
</P>
<P>
   This DNA includes a gene that makes the potato resistant to the
antibiotic kanamycin and another that makes a substance which
stains blue. These extra genes give researchers a convenient way to
identify plants that have incorporated the lectin gene into their
DNA. The construct also includes a ``promoter'' sequence from a
cauliflower mosaic virus, which boosts the production of the lectin
protein.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that such a construct is a health risk flies in face of
the conventional biological wisdom. But given that similar
constructs are found in other genetically modified plants, it's a
disturbing suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   One of Pusztai's supporters, Stanley Ewen, a pathologist at the
University of Aberdeen, has made further observations that add to
the controversy. When Ewen examined samples of gut lining from rats
which had eaten the transgenic potatoes, he saw abnormalities such
as increased production of cells in intestinal crypts, the clefts
between the fingerlike villi that line the wall of the small
intestine.
</P>
<P>
   Pusztai's own report on his experiments, which he sent to Rowett
director Philip James in October, was released last week by the
environmental group Friends of the Earth at a press conference
attended by scientists sympathetic to Pusztai. They are angry with
the institute for disciplining Pusztai after he spoke out on
television.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of researchers are unconvinced by Pusztai's data and
skeptical of the theory that the construct is to blame. One problem
is that Pusztai's report does not include key raw data on the
spiked potatoes needed to verify his claim that the genetic
manipulation was the source of the problems.
</P>
<P>
   The most likely explanation, says Willy Peumans, whose team at
the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium has supplied Pusztai
with lectins to feed to rats, is that the process of inserting the
lectin gene into potato cells and their growth in tissue culture
disrupted the behavior of the potatoes' other genes. This may have
altered the plants' biochemistry and made them produce high levels
of other toxic substances, such as alkaloids.
</P>
<P>
   This theory is strengthened by the fact that the protein, starch
and glucose levels of the transgenic potatoes all differed markedly
from those of the natural plant. They contained 20 percent less
protein than normal, for example, and Pusztai had to add protein
supplements to the rats' meals.
</P>
<P>
   If the altered potatoes' strange biochemistry, rather than the
inserted DNA, lies behind their toxic effects, the implications for
food safety are less serious. Crop engineers already test for
altered biochemistry, and regulators won't approve such a plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would chuck it out straight away,'' says Mike Gasson of the
Institute of Food Research in Norwich, who sits on the British
government's Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that produce genetically modified crops claim that
their own toxicity tests would have identified similar problems.
James Astwood, head of product safety at Monsanto's headquarters in
St. Louis, says the company routinely carries out feeding trials on
mice in which internal organs are closely examined and weighed.
Novartis of Basel, Switzerland, which makes maize with a gene for
an insecticidal toxin, says that mice were unharmed when they ate
the maize.
</P>
<P>
   On one thing, however, everyone agrees. Answering all the
questions raised by Pusztai's preliminary findings will require
tests on plants engineered to contain DNA constructs, but lacking
genes for lectin or the other genes added in commercially grown
genetically modified crops. ``What we need is a set of data from
experiments with the construct alone,'' Ewen says. &QL;

<P>
   Does the prospect of developing an effective AIDS vaccine
justify condemning chimpanzees to death? That's the stark question
dividing biomedical researchers in the United States, now that
virologists know that some strains of HIV cause the same fatal
illness in chimps as they do in people.
</P>
<P>
   Already, several chimps have been deliberately infected with HIV
strains that can kill them. And the researcher who discovered that
chimps can develop AIDS plans to expose up to four more animals to
this lethal virus.
</P>
<P>
   These experiments could be the prelude to vaccine experiments
involving larger numbers of apes. That prospect has outraged animal
welfare campaigners _ and many researchers. No scientist would
infect a person with HIV deliberately, they point out. Being our
closest living relatives, they argue, chimps should be treated with
similar respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can compare a chimp to a mildly retarded child. Just
because it's mildly retarded doesn't mean you abuse it,'' says
Alfred Prince, a virologist at the New York Blood Center. Along
with 11 other scientists, he has sent a letter to the journal
Science raising ethical and scientific objections to the use of
lethal HIV strains in chimps. Another of the signatories is
primatologist Jane Goodall, famous for her studies of wild chimps
in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Chimps are no longer used in research in many countries,
including Britain and Australia. But in the United States, more
than 100 of the apes have been infected with different strains of
HIV since the early 1980s. Until recently, it seemed that HIV never
causes AIDS in chimps. This meant that chimps fell from favor as an
animal model for AIDS research and limited the controversy
surrounding the experiments.
</P>
<P>
   But that all changed in 1997, when Frank Novembre of the Yerkes
Regional Primate Research Center in Atlanta reported a single case
of HIV causing AIDS in a chimp. Since then, the virus responsible
has been deliberately passed on to a handful of other chimps. None
of these animals has yet developed AIDS, but some have extremely
low levels of CD4 cells, the white blood cells that are destroyed
by HIV. This suggests that it is only a matter of time before they
become sick and die.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is that we now have a pathogenic HIV model in a
chimp,'' says Alan Schultz, head of preclinical research in the
AIDS vaccine program of the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases near Washington DC. ``The bad news is that to
do meaningful vaccine experiments, we will have to put chimps'
lives at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   The NIAID is now funding Novembre to expose up to four more
chimps to lethal HIV strains, with the aim of working out the
smallest dose needed to establish an infection via the rectum.
Novembre and virologist Patricia Fultz of the University of Alabama
at Birmingham have already exposed chimps with good immune
responses to less virulent strains of HIV to one of the new
aggressive strains. The existing infection appeared to offer some
protection.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes for a vaccine that can completely prevent HIV infection
are fading, however, so attention is shifting toward vaccines that
might slow the progression to AIDS. These could be tested in chimps
infected with the lethal strains. The alternative _ going straight
into tests on people with HIV _ is complicated by the widespread
use of anti-retroviral drugs, which also delay the progression to
AIDS. This would make it difficult to distinguish the effect of the
vaccine from that of the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Fultz argues that terminal experiments involving chimps are a
necessary evil. ``With 40 million people infected in the world,
there is a great need for a vaccine'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But Prince claims the chimp experiments are flawed. The virulent
HIV strains are more aggressive than the strains that usually
infect people, he says, so potentially effective vaccines could get
overlooked. Fultz disagrees: ``The strain I have is very much like
HIV in humans.''
</P>
<P>
   Irrespective of the scientific arguments, however, many people
would oppose the experiments on ethical grounds _ particularly in
the light of current efforts to grant legal rights to chimps and
other great apes.
</P>
<P>
   Prince hopes his letter to Science will provoke sufficient
public outcry to prompt a moratorium on potentially terminal AIDS
experiments involving chimps. &QL;

<P>
   Does the prospect of developing an effective AIDS vaccine
justify condemning chimpanzees to death? That's the stark question
dividing biomedical researchers in the United States, now that
virologists know that some strains of HIV cause the same fatal
illness in chimps as they do in people.
</P>
<P>
   Already, several chimps have been deliberately infected with HIV
strains that can kill them. And the researcher who discovered that
chimps can develop AIDS plans to expose up to four more animals to
this lethal virus.
</P>
<P>
   These experiments could be the prelude to vaccine experiments
involving larger numbers of apes. That prospect has outraged animal
welfare campaigners _ and many researchers. No scientist would
infect a person with HIV deliberately, they point out. Being our
closest living relatives, they argue, chimps should be treated with
similar respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can compare a chimp to a mildly retarded child. Just
because it's mildly retarded doesn't mean you abuse it,'' says
Alfred Prince, a virologist at the New York Blood Center. Along
with 11 other scientists, he has sent a letter to the journal
Science raising ethical and scientific objections to the use of
lethal HIV strains in chimps. Another of the signatories is
primatologist Jane Goodall, famous for her studies of wild chimps
in Tanzania.
</P>

<P>
   An automatic back-seat driver is being tested by researchers in
Germany. But rather than nagging and telling the driver to slow
down on empty roads, this back-seat driver can take control of the
car and maneuver it out of danger.
</P>
<P>
   Having taken charge of the accelerator, brakes and steering, the
intelligent car drives autonomously in urban traffic and will even
indicate when it is about to change lanes. If the driver wants to
regain control, he/she simply has to grab the wheel and start
driving again.
</P>
<P>
   Basic automatic ``co-pilots,'' such as the Distronic system in
the S Class Mercedes, are already on the market. But these simply
regulate the distance between cars and have no control over the
steering. And this sort of system is limited to motorway driving,
where there is more room to maneuver and there are clearer road
markings.
</P>
<P>
   The new system, developed at the Fraunhofer Institute for
Information and Data Processing in Karlsruhe, is meant to cope with
busy urban conditions. Andrew Plummer, a mechanical engineer at
Leeds University who was recently given a grant by BMW-owned Rover
to build an intelligent car, says this type of driving is
particularly challenging. ``It's the most difficult environment
because there's so much going on,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   What makes urban conditions so difficult, says Frank Heimes, the
co-pilot's engineer, is that it is not always obvious what counts
as a road lane. Other drivers frequently ignore lane markings,
which can obscure them and can sometimes make them redundant.
</P>
<P>
   The Fraunhofer car overcomes this problem by ``going with the
flow.'' To avoid complications it simply stays in line with the
other cars, speeding up when they do and slowing or stopping when
necessary. A result of this, Heimes says, is that the car won't
automatically observe speed limits.
</P>
<P>
   Two microprocessors figure out where the car is at any time, in
relation to other cars and to the boundaries of the road. To do
this the car uses stored 3-D models of what different types of road
_ such as intersections, two-lane and three-lane roads _ should
look like, as well as cars, trucks and pedestrians. By comparing
images captured by two forward-facing cameras with models in its
database, the computer works out where the car is and what vehicles
and people are around.
</P>
<P>
   The test system has its weaknesses, not least the fact that it
depends on a database of ideal roads of specified widths. The
system also works better at slow speeds. ``But humans have their
weaknesses too,'' Heimes says.
</P>
<P>
   He says it will be a long time before we see such vehicles on
the road, because the electronics are still too big to fit in most
of today's cars. That's not the only obstacle: In many countries,
the law would have to be changed. In Britain, for example,
automatic control of steering and brakes is illegal _ and drivers
would still be liable for any accidents. &QL;

CELLUCCI BILL DEAD ON ARRIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIAN WALKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; To the surprise of no one, Governor Paul Cellucci and
Lieutenant Governor Jane Swift have begun the annual saber-rattling
for the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   While no one knows for sure what the outcome this year will be,
the shape of the new bill makes passage even less likely than in
years past.
</P>
<P>
   As you may recall, the death penalty lost last year by literally
the narrowest of margins, coming to a tie vote in a bitterly
divided House. The uncertainty over its prospects this time owe
much to the large number of open seats _ currently four, probably
six by spring _ that must be filled in special elections. How these
question marks will vote is unknown. But many of the 21 freshman
legislators have indicated they would support only a narrowly drawn
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Yet inexplicably, Cellucci and Swift have loaded this year's
bill with even more circumstances under which the death penalty
could be imposed, making it even less likely that legislators on
the fence will embrace their cause.
</P>
<P>
   Defeat of the death penalty this time around would come as good
news to many, myself included. It's hard to understand what a state
with a plunging violent-crime rate _ and far fewer murders than
such temples of death-penalty doom as Texas and Florida _ would
gain from a death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   And that is even without taking into account the compelling
arguments that blacks receive the death penalty at a hugely
disproportionate and discriminatory rate, and that innocent people
do get convicted of capital crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the debate this time seems likely to take place
without the kind of public outrage over the murder of 10-year-old
Jeffrey Curley that last year propelled the measure closer to
passage than ever before. That fact alone has heartened death
penalty opponents in the House, who believe that the public
normally opposes capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   The new bill would include as capital crimes 16 types of murder,
including murder committed in the course of drug trafficking,
murder committed by the use of a bomb, or murder committed by an
inmate while incarcerated. Last year's bill included 12 types of
murder.
</P>
<P>
   Why would Cellucci take that approach if he really wanted the
bill to pass? Because his bill is little more than a symbolic
gesture.
</P>
<P>
   Barely 10 years ago, Cellucci was a state senator opposed to the
death penalty. When he contemplated a run for governor in 1990, he
became a supporter of capital punishment for cop killers. Now he
supports it for more and more types of crime each year.
</P>
<P>
   Swift is even more confused. She never supported the death
penalty until the day she was unveiled as Cellucci's third-choice
running mate. Now her death penalty support comes wrapped in the
pro-family blanket in which she has cloaked herself since her
inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reinstating the death penalty will prevent murderers from
claiming another victim, amd will bolster our efforts to protect
children, families, and police officers across the Commonwealth,''
she said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As their decision to broaden the bill demonstrates, Cellucci and
Swift are primarily seeking a flag to wave before as many victims
of as many types of crime as possible. They will insist that they
tried to get tough on crime, and leave it to the Legislature to
reject the bill as unwieldy.
</P>
<P>
   During his years as lieutenant governor and governor, Cellucci
has increasingly moved to the right on crime issues. He was
initially inspired by his desire to be more in tune with
then-Governor William F. Weld. Now, as he seeks to rejuvenate the
Massachusetts Republican Party and win the respect of its more
conservative members, he is forced to resist what they would view
as a watered-down death penalty bill.
</P>
<P>
   He could very well win the fight for a death penalty, but only
at the cost of accepting the limitations championed by the
Democratic legislature. He has instead chosen the grand gesture,
death penalty for any shocking homicide.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts does not need a death penalty. It has just as
little need for an effort more calculated to win political support
than to actually pass. Not for the first time, Paul Cellucci's
position on capital punishment is as much a reflection of his
political goals as his view of appropriate punishment.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel and Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``Affliction'' R (profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nick Nolte and James Coburn.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar nominee Nick Nolte gives a searing, career-defining
performance in this soul-weary study of one of the walking dead.
Nolte plays a troubled New England cop whose ``afflictions''
include an angry ex-wife, a frightened young daughter, a boss who
belittles him and a roaringly abusive father (James Coburn, also
Oscar-nominated). 1 hour, 44 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Blast From the Past'' PG-13 (profanity, sex, drug references)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Brendan Fraser, Christopher Walken and Sissy Spacek.
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Fraser does another culture-clash, fish-out-of-water
flick, playing a guy who climbs into the '90s after spending all
his life in a bomb shelter. You wait for the high-concept comedy to
make some smart observations (or at least some decent jokes) about
the collision of the '60s and '90s. But the humor and the plot are
amateurish, leaving its cast flailing. 1 hour, 52 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``A Bug's Life'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of Dave Foley, Kevin Spacey, Julia
Louis-Dreyfus.
</P>
<P>
   A multi-legged wonder. The newest computer-animated feature from
the makers of ``Toy Story'' is the eye-popping, witty tale of an
ant named Flik (voice of Dave Foley), who recruits a bunch of
circus bugs to battle evil grasshoppers (the chief villain is
voiced by Kevin Spacey). There's enough going on here to keep every
adult, child or arachnid vastly entertained. 1 hour, 34 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Central Station'' R (profanity and mature themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Fernanda Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   In this tender and unexpectedly moving Brazilian film, a sour
old woman (Oscar nominee Fernanda Montenegro) takes a motherless
boy she barely knows into rural Brazil to find the father he's
never met. Montenegro's performance is a beautiful study in
bitterness dissuaded, of possibility and optimism stumbled on after
too long an absence from someone's life. Subtitles. 1 hour, 55
minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``A Civil Action'' PG-13 (profanity and mature themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Travolta and Robert Duvall.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a true story, this legal thriller stars John Travolta
as a small-time personal injury lawyer who tackles two giant
corporations. Oscar nominee Robert Duvall is his cagey opponent.
Travolta is miscast and the movie can't quite decide what its focus
is. Still, it more than makes its case with intelligence and
old-fashioned Hollywood ``let us entertain you'' craft. 2 hours. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Down in the Delta'' PG-13 (profanity, drug references)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Alfre Woodard and Al Freeman Jr.
</P>
<P>
   This warm, funny, utterly engaging family film insists you can
go home again, even if you've never been there before. Alfre
Woodard stars as a messed-up Chicago single mom with two kids. Her
own mother (Mary Alice) ships her south to Mississippi to stay with
her uncle
</P>
<P>
   (Al Freeman Jr.) and try to get her life straight. 1 hour, 41
minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Elizabeth'' R (violence and sex)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush.
</P>
<P>
   This opulent period film puts a slight feminist gloss on the
early reign of 16th-century monarch Elizabeth I, showing her
transformation from a radiant, saucy innocent to a polished,
guarded ruler. Oscar nominee Cate Blanchett gives a luminous
portrayal, and Geoffrey Rush, also an Oscar nominee, gives her
sturdy support as court politics and intrigues swirl about. This is
a really good story. 2 hours, 4 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by David Breashears.
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' David
Breashears'
</P>
<P>
   documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm that
killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.''44 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Gods and Monsters '' Not rated but sexual themes and brief
nudity.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ian McKellen and Brendan Fraser.
</P>
<P>
   Three Oscar nominations. A brilliant reimagining of the final
days of gay British director James Whale. Whale, best known for his
classic horror movies (``Bride of Frankenstein''), died
mysteriously in 1957. Played here by the marvelous Ian McKellen
(best actor), he's an isolated, forgotten recluse who becomes
interested in the hunky new gardener (Brendan Fraser). 1 hour, 35
minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Hilary and Jackie'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Emily Watson and Rachel Griffiths.
</P>
<P>
   Never quite hitting its intended crescendo, this real-life
psychological drama about the relationship between two musical
sisters still strikes some major chords. Oscar nominee Emily Watson
(``Breaking the Waves'') stars as Jacqueline du Pre, a world-famous
cellist who died in 1987 of multiple sclerosis. Rachel Griffiths,
also nominated, plays her sister, Hilary. 2 hours. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Jawbreaker'' R (profanity, sexuality and violence, all
involving teens)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Rose McGowan, Rebecca Gayheart and Judy Evans Greer.
</P>
<P>
   Rose McGowan is the queen of mean in this high school comedy
about four teen girls who terrorize the hallways. Things get
complicated when one of the four accidentally dies, and her friends
cover it up. The black comedy borrows heavily from ``Carrie'' and
``Heathers,'' but it has a snappy style all its own.1 hour, 27
minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Life Is Beautiful'' PG-13 (Holocaust-related atrocities)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Roberto Benigni.
</P>
<P>
   Seven Oscar nominations including best picture, best actor and
best screenplay. An Italian Jew shields his son from the horrors of
a concentration camp by pretending their predicament is part of a
big, complicated game. Roberto Benigni's low-comedy slapstick
approach isn't entirely convincing and is often chillingly
wrongheaded. Subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   At metro theaters. 2 hours, 2 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Little Voice'' R (profanity, brief nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jane Horrocks, Brenda Blethyn and Michael Caine.
</P>
<P>
   British actress Jane Horrocks, who can belt out tone-perfect
impersonations of everyone from Judy Garland to Shirley Bassey, is
pretty much the whole show here. The rest of the film is a fairly
feeble show-biz fable in which her blowzy mom (Oscar nominee Brenda
Blethyn) and a seedy agent (Michael Caine) try to get this shy
recluse onstage.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 30 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Message in a Bottle'' PG-13 (profanity and sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Costner, Robin Wright Penn and Paul Newman.
</P>
<P>
   Two messages here: Old-fashioned romances still work, and Kevin
Costner needs an ego check. Badly. For a good while, the movie lets
us luxuriate in the pleasures of sailboats, sunsets, candlelit
dinners, etc. Plus, there's comic relief courtesy of Paul Newman
and Robbie Contrane. But the last 15 minutes are a lunkheaded
embarrassment and Costner (he co-produced) is to blame.2 hours, 12
minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``My Favorite Martian'' PG (violence, partial nudity and
profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jeff Daniels, Christopher Lloyd.
</P>
<P>
   A big-screen remake of the '60s TV series, with the annoying and
unsubtle Christopher Lloyd as the Martian who camps in Jeff
Daniels' living room. The movie is cobbled together with cheesy
special effects and easy gags. But for kids, it's an OK babysitter.
1 hour, 33 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``October Sky'' PG (profanity, sensuality, alcohol use, some
thematic elements)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Chris Cooper and Laura Dern.
</P>
<P>
   Deeply satisfying tale of West Virginia teen Homer (Jake
Gyllenhaal) and three friends who, in the 1950s, began to build and
shoot off model rockets. Their goal: to win a science fair, which
could help them escape a future of working in the coal mine of
their small town. Based on Homer Hickman's autobiography ``Rocket
Boys,'' it makes the process of learning seem as exciting as a
special FX-driven action flick.1 hour, 48 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Office Space'' R (profanity, partial nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ron Livingston, Jennifer Aniston, Stephen Root, Gary
Cole.
</P>
<P>
   An amusingly and eerily familiar comedy for anyone who's ever
struggled against the monotonous mind control of a large corporate
workplace. After wittily building audience resentment for nearly 90
minutes, writer-director Mike Judge (TV's ``Beavis &AMP; Butt-head,''
``King of the Hill'') seems to pull his punches with a
less-than-apocalyptic ending.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 30 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Patch Adams'' PG-13 (profanity, crude humor)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robin Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Williams plays a renegade med student who believes the
rigid rules of health care could use a few laughs. It's ``Dead
Poets Society'' with lab coats. The laughs are good, but when it
tries to get serious (often), the flick is as deep as a bedpan. 1
hour, 56 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Payback'' R (violence, profanity, drug and sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mel Gibson and Gregg Henry.
</P>
<P>
   A by-the-numbers vengeance thriller starring Mel Gibson. It's as
generic as its unnamed, dull gray city. 1 hour, 42 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``The Prince of Egypt'' PG (violence, intense themes)
</P>
<P>
   With the voices of Val Kilmer and Ralph Fiennes.
</P>
<P>
   A spectacular animated musical epic that retells _ with some
embellishments _ the Book of Exodus. Val Kilmer is the voice of
Moses, God's choice to lead the Hebrew people from slavery in
Egypt. Ralph Fiennes speaks for the Pharaoh, Moses' ``adopted''
brother. Other talent includes Michelle Pfeiffer, Jeff Goldblum and
a host of animators. The movie is visually impressive, insistently
reverential.1 hour, 39 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Rushmore'' R (profanity and brief nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Olivia Williams.
</P>
<P>
   This original prep school fable pits 15-year-old Max (Jason
Schwartzman) against a tycoon (Bill Murray) in a battle for the
love of a schoolteacher (Olivia Williams). The second film from
director Wes Anderson and co-writer Owen Wilson proves that they
haven't lost the off-kilter wit and viewpoint they first showed in
``Bottle Rocket.''
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 33 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan'' R (extreme violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Hanks, Matt Damon and Edward Burns.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven Oscar nominations including best picture. Part gung-ho
heroism, part in-your-face horror show, Steven Spielberg's superb
film shows us World War II as we've never seen it before. Tom Hanks
leads a courageous squad on a mission to find a private whose three
brothers have already been killed in combat. 2 hours, 50 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare in Love'' R (sexuality, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow and Geoffrey Rush.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen Oscar nominations including best picture. Poor,
overworked Will Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) has to finish his play
``Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter'' and try to win the hand
of noblewoman Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow) in this witty comedy that
uses some of the Bard's more outrageous plot devices. 2 hours, 2
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``She's All That'' PG-13 (profanity, sexual innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Freddie Prinze Jr., Rachael Leigh Cook.
</P>
<P>
   High school star Zack (Freddie Prinze Jr.) accepts a bet to turn
geeky Laney (Rachael Leigh Cook) into a prom queen, and falls in
love with her. An amusing, genial reworking of ``Pygmalion,'' the
comedy has one big problem: Its leads are beautiful, but distant. 1
hour, 37 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``A Simple Plan'' R (profanity, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton and Bridget Fonda.
</P>
<P>
   Anything but simple, this is a character-driven black comedy
with some powerful moral-qualm undercurrents. In the deep snows of
rural Minnesota, two brothers (Bill Paxton, Oscar nominee Billy Bob
Thornton) and a pal (Brent Briscoe) find a downed plane with $4
million in cash. Their ``simple plan'' to split the money leads to
a chain of increasingly disastrous events. 1 hour, 57 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Steam: The Turkish Bath'' Not rated but has adult sexual
themes.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Alessandro Gassman.
</P>
<P>
   Did not open last week as indicated. An Italian yuppie goes to
Istanbul to dispose of the property left him by his aunt. He
intends to sell everything and get home quickly, but once there,
he's seduced. By the city, by a warmhearted Turkish family, by a
new sense of himself and his sexuality. The plot is soggily
familiar, but as a love letter to Istanbul, it is quite wonderful.
Subtitles. 1 hour, 34 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Stepmom'' PG-13 (profanity, adult themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Susan Sarandon, Julia Roberts and Ed Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts play competing moms _ one
biological, the other step _ in this comedy/weepie that tackles
some complex ``blended family'' issues, then cops out by giving a
character a fatal disease. Still, the sturdy cast does much to
redeem the mush-headed script (add Ed Harris in the dishonest role
of doting dad who somehow never sees his kids).2 hours. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thin Red Line'' R (profanity and war violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sean Penn, Jim Caviezel, Nick Nolte, Woody Harrelson
and Adrien Brody.
</P>
<P>
   Seven Oscar nominations including best picture. Less a war movie
than a meditation on life, death, love, hate, man and nature.
Terrence Malick puts his unmistakable stamp on the drama of an Army
division's struggle to capture Guadalcanal from the Japanese during
World War II. 2 hours, 50 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``T. rex: Back to the Cretaceous'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   Starring Liz Stauber and Peter Horton.
</P>
<P>
   The IMAX film has awesome special effects but, as a fictional
story, is too short. Ally Hayden (Liz Stauber) is a budding teenage
paleontologist who wants to go on a dig with her dino-hunting dad
(Peter Horton). When her dad brings what could be a dinosaur egg
into his lab, Ally, alone with it, accidentally cracks it and is
thrust back in time 65 million years, when the big beasts roamed
the Earth. 40 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The 24 Hour Woman'' R (profanity and sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Rosie Perez.
</P>
<P>
   Starts so well and ends so woefully that you wish it had been
called ``The 12-Hour Woman.'' Rosie Perez is a producer of one of
those generic daytime TV shows, whose pregnancy it chronicles. The
bit is a rating bonanza, but possible casualties include her
privacy, her sanity and her marriage. Nice idea, but soon the movie
turns as frantic and shallow as the TV show it so expertly
lampoons.1 hour, 36 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Varsity Blues'' R (profanity, sexuality, nudity, substance
abuse)
</P>
<P>
   Starring James Van Der Beek and Jon Voight.
</P>
<P>
   James Van Der Beek plays a high school football player in this
insulting mix of beery teenage humor and rampant sexuality. 1 hour,
40 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``Waking Ned Devine'' PG (sexual themes, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ian Bannen and David Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   A broad, twinkly Irish comedy about what happens in a tiny
village when it's discovered that one of the residents is the
holder of a lottery ticket worth nearly $7 million. The movie is a
little too eager to please, a little too Lucky Charms Irish. But
the two leads, devilish old-pro codgers Ian Bannen and David Kelly,
are practiced charmers, and there are lots of winning little
moments along the way.1 hour, 30 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``You've Got Mail'' PG
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   This Internet-era update of ``The Shop Around the Corner'' stars
Tom Hanks as a book-chain magnate and Meg Ryan as the small-store
owner he's putting out of business. Little do they know that
they're each other's e-mail sweethearts. ``Sleepless in Seattle''
director Nora Ephron gets the charm working again in a remake that
delivers. 2 hours. B

 &HT;    Mommy track has many bumps
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The 24 Hour Woman'' starts out so well and ends so woefully
that you wish it had been called ``The 12 Hour Woman'' instead. In
other words, it's too bad this movie couldn't have quit while it
was ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The film's title actually refers to a TV show _ one of those
generic daytime mishmashes of celebs, psychics, chefs and
``pantyhose victims'' _ where Grace (Rosie Perez) works as a
producer. Her husband, Eddie (Diego Serrano), is the program's
twinkly, insistently upbeat co-host. When Grace discovers she's
pregnant, her boss (Patti LuPone) decides to chronicle every
conceivable post-conception moment on the air, from weigh-ins to
morning sickness to an only-on-daytime-TV aerobics hybrid called
strollercizing.
</P>
<P>
   The having-my-baby bit is a ratings bonanza. By the time Grace
has her little girl, the show has gone network. But Grace's private
life is an early casualty, followed by her sanity, her professional
life and, possibly, her marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The movie makes some fine points along the way. It looks at
parenting woes _ how baby-shower coos can turn so quickly to
three-in-the-morning wails _ as well as the ongoing pressures
facing working parents. Especially working moms who can barely do
it all, much less have it all. Plus, writer-director Nancy Savoca
gets off some hilarious satiric jabs at the morning-show mentality
and its chirpy condescension toward its audience. The intro for
``The 24 Hour Woman'' goes something like this: ``Whether you're
running with the wolves or running to work!!!!''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the movie itself turns as silly and frenetic as
the show it lampoons. The energy that made the early scenes crackle
lapses into bothersome static as the script loses its way. A
promising subplot concerning Grace's assistant, ``Secrets &AMP; Lies'''
Marianne Jean-Baptiste as a working mother with three kids and a
stay-at-home husband, never takes off. And while Savoca is savvy
enough to pinpoint workplace tensions _ ``Boy, I'd like to be part
of the Mommy Club and have an eight-hour day,'' snipes another
producer _ there's no follow-up.
</P>
<P>
   The good news, though, is Perez. She chucks her feisty sex-toy
shtick and shows us a mature, multifaceted woman. Yet she still
remains adorable enough to get away with an eight-month-and-holding
whine to Eddie: ``I'm tired of being pregnant. You take over.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The 24 Hour Woman'' is one of those bits-and-pieces pictures.
You have to take the good bits with the bad pieces. Too bad so much
of the good is at the beginning and so much of the bad is at the
end. It leaves you thinking it's a far worse movie than it actually
is. Well, make that a far more painful experience than it actually
is.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 24 Hour Woman''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Starring Rosie Perez. Directed by Nancy Savoca. Rated R for
language and sexual situations. At Phipps. 1 hour, 36 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A good idea poorly executed.

 &HT;    Hip high school flick makes grade
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Jawbreaker,'' the sweet treat of the title turns out to be
the devil's candy.
</P>
<P>
   That's because stringy-haired geek Fern (Judy Evans Greer)
virtually sells her soul to become one of ``the flawless four.''
They're the icy beauties who prowl the halls of her high school,
led by the porcelain-skinned, peerlessly snide Courtney (Rose
McGowan).
</P>
<P>
   Fern gets to join their ranks because the foursome has dwindled
to two. One of the girls, Julie (Rebecca Gayheart), has abandoned
the Lycra-clad clique in disgust over their actions: namely, the
accidental murder of the fourth girl, Liz (Charlotte Roldan), and
the cover-up of their crime.
</P>
<P>
   See, Liz choked to death on, yes, a jawbreaker during a birthday
prank her friends pulled. For Courtney, Liz's death is about as
distressing as a broken nail. Actually, less distressing. Taking
charge of the freaked-out Julie and Marcie (Julie Benz), Courtney
takes a certain glee in arranging the virginal Liz's corpse to
suggest some sleazy foul play.
</P>
<P>
   This is the moment when Fern accidentally stumbles onto the
scene and has to make a choice: become a new member of this
fashionista coven, or possibly wind up like Liz. What's a girl to
do?
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Darren Stein's stylish, Day-Glo black comedy
borrows heavily from ``Heathers'' and ``Carrie.'' (He acknowledges
the debt, slyly casting ``Carrie'' actors P.J. Soles and William
Katt as Liz's parents.) The movie twists the makeover plot line
that drives the current romantic piffle ``She's All That'' into
something much more sinister. And funny. Courtney and crew rename
Fern ``Vylette,'' transforming the stalky, gawky teen into a model
of skin-and-bones, bleach-blond chic. (``We never, ever eat at
lunch break,'' she's warned when she makes the mistake of eyeing
her tray.)
</P>
<P>
   But ``Jawbreaker'' eventually runs into the same problems
``Heathers'' did: How do you maintain a sprightly, satiric tone
when people are dying? (The stag-party-from-hell movie ``Very Bad
Things'' also took a skid on this issue.)
</P>
<P>
   The movie never convinces us that these are real kids. It
doesn't try. Stein is more interested in the visual grace notes,
such as the comic sight of the girls lugging Liz's body along _
wobbling on their candy-colored stiletto heels. It's like an
``Alfred Hitchcock Presents'' stretched out to feature length and
remade in the style of an MTV special.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason to watch is McGowan, filling the screen with her
delectable-diabolical persona. The movie also gets mileage from a
crack supporting cast including Pam Grier, Carol Kane and a cameo
by Brian Warner (better known as shock rocker Marilyn Manson,
McGowan's offscreen boyfriend).
</P>
<P>
   ``Jawbreaker'' is a lick mix of the sour and the sweet. This
week's latest teen movie, it has all the staying power of candy.
You'll enjoy it, but it melts away almost before you've left the
theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jawbreaker''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Rose McGowan, Rebecca Gayheart and Judy Evans Greer.
Rated R for sexuality, language and violence, all involving
teenagers. At metro theaters. 1 hour, 27 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: The latest weekly teen comedy, but at least this
one has style and edge.

 &HT;    `Office' rings with an eerie familiarity
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the more wittily ironic _ if not the subtlest _ plot
points in ``Office Space'' concerns a midlevel corporate computer
drudge named Peter and his visit to an ``occupational
hypnotherapist'' in hopes of relieving his work malaise.
</P>
<P>
   When the hypnotherapist drops dead before removing the
therapeutic trance he has induced, Peter (Ron Livingston) never has
to come out of his dreamlike state. Suddenly, work no longer is an
angst-filled, cubicle-ridden minefield; it's not even something he
has to bother showing up on time for, let alone in a suit and tie.
In fact, one day Peter goes fishing, then arrives in shorts to gut
his catch right there atop spreadsheets on his desk at Initech
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   All this naturally captures the attention of consultants brought
in by Initech to help it ``make some changes'' (translation: fire a
bunch of people). Peter is great management material, they decide,
and hand him a big promotion.
</P>
<P>
   It's all just exposition, a way of setting up the main story
line about Peter and his fired friends' scheme to rip off Initech.
And yet it's also what hits home most clearly in this largely
amusing live-action feature debut from Mike Judge, creator of the
animated TV hits ``Beavis &AMP; Butt-head'' and ``King of the Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who succeed in the modern-day workplace, Judge seems to be
saying, are victims of a sort of corporate-induced mind control.
Unfortunately, so are the ones who don't succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Take Joanna (Jennifer Aniston), the waitress Peter lusts for at
a TGI Friday's-cum-Bennigan's chain eatery, where the employees'
suspenders are covered with sloganeering buttons known as ``flair''
(sample: ``We're not in Kansas anymore!'') that the restaurant
supplies. Joanna's 15 flairs meet the chain's daily minimum
requirement, but they still leave her about 20 behind another eager
beaver.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do want to express yourself, right?'' the manager asks
her, without a hint of irony, but with plenty of implied threat, in
his voice.
</P>
<P>
   Or take Peter, who early on commits the cardinal sin of sending
on a complete piece of work sans the cover sheet that has been the
subject of a companywide memo. We know this because no fewer than
four management types stop by his cubicle to wonder aloud, ``Didn't
you get the memo?''
</P>
<P>
   The master of this bland, brainwashing form of managementspeak
is Bill Lumbergh (Gary Cole), Peter's uberboss and a man with a
seemingly limitless supply of suspenders and sherbet-colored dress
shirts.
</P>
<P>
   If this or any other aspect of ``Office Space'' ends up hitting
uncomfortably close to home, well, join the club. About halfway
through the movie, you'll probably stop thinking, ``Thank God I
don't work at Initech,'' and start wondering, ``My God, do I work
at Initech?''
</P>
<P>
   Creating that rueful sense of self-recognition may be what
``Office Space'' does best, but it also creates the biggest
letdown. After nearly 90 minutes of having our resentment toward
Initech and its honchos stoked, we can't help but feel cheated by
the film's less-than-apocalyptic conclusion. While that's not to
say we needed to see Lumbergh and one of his sherbet shirts riddled
with bullets, we at least deserved to find out what eventually
became of him.
</P>
<P>
   Peter may not have needed that sharp wake-up snap to
successfully complete his work-related therapy. But viewers of
``Office Space'' do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Office Space''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ron Livingston, Jennifer Aniston, Gary Cole, Stephen
Root and Diedrich Bader. Written and directed by Mike Judge. Rated
R for language and sexual situations. 1 hour, 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: If you've ever worked, ``Office Space'' does too.

   When it comes to dodging disaster, the champions of the insect
world have to be cockroaches. Biologists in Israel have found that
the scavengers can twist and turn up to 25 times per second, making
them the most nimble-footed creatures known in the animal kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   As cockroaches are nocturnal and can run at nearly 1 meter per
second, Jeff Camhi and his colleagues at the Hebrew University of
Jerusalem wanted to find out how they avoid blundering into
obstacles. Other nocturnal animals rely on nonvisual cues. Bats,
for example, use echolocation.
</P>
<P>
   The team put roaches through their paces in a circular enclosure
bisected by a tin wall. The insects usually ran along beside this
wall and were filmed with a high-speed video camera recording 250
frames per second.
</P>
<P>
   The cockroaches maintained a constant distance from the wall
during their runs, the team found. The insects appeared to be using
their long antennae to achieve this feat, because they almost
always kept one antenna in contact with the wall.
</P>
<P>
   When the researchers swapped the straight wall for one that
zigzagged in and out, the roaches still managed to follow its
contours, making rapid turns to avoid colliding with the
projections. In some of the runs, they managed 25 turns per second.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know of no other orientation behavior in any animal capable
of such a high frequency of body turning,'' Camhi says. ``If the
cockroach were not such a bad house guest, it would no doubt
receive the admiration it richly deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   To check the bugs weren't using visual cues to steer round the
projections, Camhi blindfolded them with blobs of darkened wax.
Still the insects twisted and turned. They even navigated correctly
with the bases of their antennae immobilized by glue. But with the
tips of their antennae removed, the roaches constantly bumped into
the zigzagging wall. The researchers conclude that they navigate by
using the changing bend in the tips of their antennae.
</P>
<P>
   The quick reactions of cockroaches suggest they have unusually
efficient nervous systems. ``Once the nerve signals reach the
brain, giant neurons are ready and waiting to carry these signals
to the leg-control centers,'' Camhi says. However, it is unclear
how signals to change direction manage to reach the brain so
quickly. The sensory nerve fibers in the tips of cockroach antennae
have narrow diameters, and would be expected to conduct signals
relatively slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most talented roboticist in the world is not going to come
close to what a cockroach can do,'' says Roy Ritzmann, who studies
cockroach behavior at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.
He points out that cockroaches have had several million years in
which to hone their reflexes. ``When I'm studying them in the lab,
I'm amazed by them.'' &QL;

OCTOBER SKY A REFRESHING '50S COMING-OF-AGE DRAMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The coming-of-age drama has been the most cliche-driven and
overworked movie genre of the last 30 years, mostly in the field of
independent and foreign films, but also in Hollywood, which has
lately given us such sour apples in that particular box as ``Simon
Birch'' and ``The Mighty.''
</P>
<P>
   But every so often, a film comes along that fits snugly in this
category, and follows its formula to the letter, yet still manages
to be something more than the sum of its familiar parts: a film
like ``The 400 Blows,'' ``My Life as a Dog'' or ``A River Runs
Through It.''
</P>
<P>
   Another is ``October Sky,'' a coming-of-age in the '50s drama
that follows its well-trodden path with such faith in its material,
and such a strong cast and well-crafted script, that it all seems
to be happening for the first time. All told, it's as enriching a
movie experience as the new year has given us.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the best-selling memoir, ``Rocket Boys,'' and set in a
West Virginia coal-mining town in 1957, it's the true story of
Homer Hickam, a 17-year-old who glimpses nirvana the night he sees
Sputnik shooting across the sky and decides, on the spot, to be a
rocket scientist.
</P>
<P>
   He soon recruits his three best pals and starts making his own
amateur rockets, to the chagrin of his father (Chris Cooper) and
the whole town, but supported by his teacher (Laura Dern), who
encourages the boys to enter the National Science Fair in hopes of
winning a scholarship, and even becoming part of America's
fledgling space program.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you read correctly. This is a serious drama about a group
of teenagers trying to expand their horizons and escape their
dreary, dead-end existence not via crime, prize-fighting or the
other methods typically glamorized by Hollywood movies, but by
going to college! And it's not a bit boring.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it does start off rather shakily, like maybe a dozen
other movies you may have seen in the '90s alone, with too many of
the same '50s rock songs on the sound track, too many familiar
scenes establishing small-town high school life, and too many
unknown actors striving too hard to make a first impression.
</P>
<P>
   But somewhere near the middle of the first act, ``October Sky''
suddenly gets good, and stays good straight to its tear-dabbing
fadeout. It finally works on at least three levels: as an
irresistible competition movie, an unusually poignant family drama,
and an authentic slice of small-town life in the '50s.
</P>
<P>
   After its opening cliches, the script by Lewis Colick (``Ghosts
of Mississippi'') quickly finds its grove and never once descends
into the kind of gratuitous teenage vulgarity and schtick that
seems to infest every movie that Hollywood touches these days. Its
characters come off as very real people of their era.
</P>
<P>
   The cast has no weak links, but its standouts are the always
reliable Chris Cooper (``Lone Star'') as the stern father who wants
his son to follow in his footsteps and Jake Gyllenhaal (son of
director Stephen Gyllenhaal), who, as Homer, gives a performance of
such effortless honesty that one suspects he'll spend his whole
career trying to top it.
</P>
<P>
   Director Joe Johnson (``The Rocketeer'') also deserves a lot of
credit for bringing off what must have seemed a very risky project
with such uncompromising integrity, and for making a mostly
intellectual pursuit like rocket science seem as dramatic, as
emotionally fulfilling and as visually exciting as any ``Rocky''
movie.
</P>
<P>
   October Sky. Directed by Joe Johnston. Screenplay by Lewis
Colick. Cast: Jake Gyllenhaal, Chris Cooper, Laura Dern, William
Lee Scott, Chris Owen, Chad Linberg. Universal Pictures. 110
minutes. Rated PG for a few scenes of intense family conflict.

 &HT;    Flashes of brilliance fill `October Sky,' an all-American story
about coming of age
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The irresistible ``October Sky'' is a movie that takes its idea
of uplift literally.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Homer H. Hickam Jr.'s autobiography, ``Rocket Boys,''
the drama centers on four teenagers obsessed with building and
launching model missiles . . . preferably without killing any
bystanders or setting the mountains on fire.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as the supportive mother of young Homer (Jake Gyllenhaal)
puts it, ``Just don't blow yourself up.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie has plenty of explosions. But its core excitement
comes from watching these self-proclaimed ``hillbillies'' discover
their own worth _ and build futures they never dreamed of _ by
using their brains.
</P>
<P>
   ``October Sky'' makes old-fashioned learning seem sexy. There's
a classroom scene involving a blackboard math formula that's as
riveting as all the bombs, smashed glass and gunfire of an entire
summer's action flicks. It's the antithesis of most current teen
movies (``She's All That,'' ``Jawbreaker''), which depict high
school as a place where you flirt, show off your new clothes and
kill time until the next keg party.
</P>
<P>
   In ``October Sky,'' the year is 1957. The place is tiny
Coalwood, W.Va. The boys' fascination with rockets ignites with a
single ``wow.'' That's Homer's response when he sees the
just-launched Soviet satellite Sputnik speed past in the starry
October sky.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have beaten the United States into space, so it's
partly national pride that makes Homer seek the help of school geek
Quentin (Chris Owen) in learning about aerodynamics. But when
Homer's pals Roy Lee (William Lee Scott) and O'Dell (Chad Lindberg)
get involved with the rocket building, you realize there's
something going on besides patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   More than a hobby, this is a chance for the boys to win the
regional science fair and escape the coal mines that swallow up
every able-bodied man of the town. That includes Homer's father,
John (Chris Cooper), the mine superintendent. In a movie full of
countdowns, he has the shortest fuse around.
</P>
<P>
   Dad is the opposite of Homer's inspiring teacher Miss Riley (a
radiant, wry Laura Dern). Early on, she reminds the boy that
science requires study and discipline: ``You can't just dream your
way out of Coalwood, Homer.'' But Homer's father thinks that's
exactly what his son is doing. Until now, the only way anyone left
town was on a football scholarship _ which is what Homer's older
brother Jim (Scott Miles) is counting on.
</P>
<P>
   The men of Coalwood don't want their kids to fail. But they've
learned the hard way that dreams can turn to dust. Coal dust. The
film's dramatic glue is the struggle of Homer and his father to
reach a truce, if not understanding. Lewis Colick's screenplay
makes young Gyllenhaal deliver a you're-my-hero speech that verges
on Hollywood cheesiness, but for the most part it doesn't betray
the precarious, love-hate dynamic between father and son.
</P>
<P>
   Better known for action films, director Joe Johnston (``Honey, I
Shrunk the Kids,'' ``Jumanji'') delivers a movie rich in texture
and place (Tennessee subs here for West Virginia). It can remind
you, favorably, of Michael Apted's ``Coal Miner's Daughter.''
Although the pace never dawdles, we get plenty of time to know the
residents of Coalwood. (One exception: the underdeveloped O'Dell,
who comes off as the Zeppo Marx of the group.)
</P>
<P>
   Gyllenhaal makes a soulful young hero, and he's well-matched by
the smoldering Cooper. Dern brings to her role a grit that keeps it
from becoming too saintly. And Natalie Canerday as Homer's mother
strikes the right notes as a woman caught between two men who can
barely stand to be in the same room.
</P>
<P>
   Massaging some of the details in ``Rocket Boys'' (which was
slightly fictionalized by Hickam), ``October Sky'' has occasional
moments of formulaic Hollywood hokum. But its genuine warmth for
its characters and the sharp ensemble performances keep you hooked.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is as corny as they come. It's also deeply satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   And just try not to cheer when, after many goof-ups, the boys
shoot off a rocket that pierces the clouds.
</P>
<P>
   ``October Sky''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Chris Cooper and Laura Dern. Rated PG
for language, brief teen sensuality and alcohol use and for some
thematic elements. 1 hour, 48 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict:
</P>
<P>
   A terrific memoir about looking for life beyond small-town
expectations.

Y2K: THE NEXT CANDIDATE FOR OVERKILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the media search for the next all-consuming saga to follow in
the footsteps of O.J., Princess Di, and Monica, one credible
candidate seems to be emerging: Y2K. The impending (or overhyped)
computer crisis possesses three crucial ingredients for a
megastory.
</P>
<P>
   First, the headlines are scary. Nightmare scenarios abound as
citizens consider stockpiling food and withdrawing their money from
the banks. The level of concern has already reached critical mass
with 53 percent of respondents to a January poll by the Media
Studies Center indicating that Y2K is one of the most critical
problems facing the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Second, like all big events, Y2K is shaping up as a TV story.
More than half the respondents say they're relying on television
for Y2K information, as opposed to only 17 percent who cite
newspapers as their medium of choice. Not surprisingly, television
also seems to be ratcheting up the anxiety quotient. According to
Media Studies Center research director Larry McGill, a quarter of
those who rely on TV for Y2K information think drastic preventive
measures may be necessary, as opposed to only 14 percent of those
who are primarily reading about Y2K in newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Finally _ and perhaps most crucially _ the public seems ready to
blame journalists. The Media Studies Center has convened public
meetings in New York City and Nashville to discuss press coverage
of the computer bug. And the consensus is that stories swerved
between nonchalance and sensationalism, with little in between.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see it addressed in a more mature manner,''
asserted one woman at the Jan. 29 New York forum. ``It's either
completely superficial or handled like a joke. Or they tend to
discuss the lunatic fringe, those who were packing up groceries and
stocking up the cabin in the woods.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They may have a new owner, but don't expect the Star and the
National Enquirer to start covering Social Security and taxes.
Instead, look for the supermarket tabloids to expand the brand into
the Internet, cable television, and new publications.
</P>
<P>
   Despite steadily declining readership thanks to the spread of
salacious celebrity journalism into the mainstream media, the two
tabloids (with a combined circulation of 4.1 million) are not
expected to undergo major surgery after their purchase by the New
York investment firm of Evercore Partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want us to do what we do best,'' says National Enquirer
editor Steve Cos. ``We may become a little more
advertiser-friendly,'' notes Star editor Phil Bunton. But the
magazine won't change in ``any dramatic way.''
</P>
<P>
   What is in the offing is an expansion of the tabloid franchise,
with some modifications. Any new teen magazine, Bunton says,
``would be in the same basic (tabloid) family, but we would not be
doing teen sex scandals.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to name a possible new Enquirer TV program, Cos came up
with ``must-view TV, a true pop culture show for the millennium.''
In this age of scandal, he may be right.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Let's borrow a page from Slate magazine's The Week/The Spin
feature. Here are two views of its decision to waive the $19.95
subscription fee that made Microsoft's journal of politics _ run by
former New Republic editor Michael Kinsley _ one of the few on-line
publications to charge for content.
</P>
<P>
   Slate's Spin: We'll more than make up for those fees with
growing advertising revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Cynics' Spin: Traditional journalism has yet to prove a
marketable commodity in cyberspace. And it may never be.
</P>
<P>
   On-line ``consumers haven't yet shown that they're ready to pay
widespread money . . . for published editorial material, what
people call content,'' says Robert Broadwater, of the investment
banking firm of Veronis, Suhler &AMP; Associates. ``It's hard to say
that a subscription dollar will never get paid by a consumer. But
it's difficult for me to say when or where or why . . . I wonder
whether traditional editorial material will work onscreen.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Broadwater, J.D. Lasica, who covers new media for the
American Journalism Review, believes only certain narrow on-line
niches _ like financial news _ can afford to dun the user. And
Slate's strategy of taking ``a highbrow literary and political
magazine and just graft(ing) it onto the Web,'' was ill-conceived.
``Journalism is not dead on the Web,'' he says, citing CNN
Interactive, Salon magazine, and MSNBC's site as more successful
examples. ``But it certainly takes a lot of time.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After years of accusing the news media of liberal bias, some
conservatives are ready to declare a ceasefire. In opening a Center
for Media and Public Policy to bridge the ``communications gap''
between the media and the right, the Heritage Foundation wants to
patch up that frayed relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The liberal press-bashing ``probably has gone on a little too
long,'' says James Hill, the former Arizona Republic opinion pages
editor who is the center's manager of professional development and
training.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Hill _ who cites media bias or hostility to
everything from the Christian Coalition to school vouchers _ thinks
conservatives get a fair shot in the mainstream press. It's just
that in trying to generate a dialogue between conservatives and
journalists, the center has decided to catch more flies with honey
than vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, says Hill simply, is to ``restore this idea of
diversity of thought.''

   Behind Garage Door No. 1: a 1999 Hyundai Sonata GLS. Price tag
roughly $18,000, plus delivery.

<P>
   Behind Garage Door No. 2: a 1999 Audi 8 Quattro. Price tag

</P>
<P>
   I was standing in the driveway and reluctant to choose either
door . . . for very different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai's reputation, shall we say, has preceded it. I can
remember the times I've turned onto a highway on-ramp, all set to
hit the gas and get up to a reasonable merging-into-traffic speed
only to see an Excel, spewing black smoke and struggling to make
headway.
</P>
<P>
   The gleaming Audi, on the other hand, with more bells and
whistles than an Inspector Gadget nightmare and its stated ambition
to bring the luxury automobile to a higher level, seemed far too
valuable to be driven on a mere roadway.
</P>
<P>
   Colleague John White solved the dilemma. His driving report on
the Audi appeared last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   So it was ``Hello, Mr. Hyundai.''
</P>
<P>
   A quick walk-around fortunately showed no family resemblance
between this restyled-for-'99 Sonata and its forebears.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the walk showed a nicely styled mid-sized family sedan
that is happy to present a new and distinctive face to the world it
hopes to conquer _ a pug-nose of a grille and amoeba-shaped
headlights.
</P>
<P>
   A price tag of just under $20,000 will get you a fully appointed
Sonata _ 2.5-liter V6, automatic transmission, air conditioning,
cruise control, leather, power moonroof, ABS, 120-watt sound system
with CD player. Our tested version came in right about $18,000,
minus the leather, ABS or moonroof. That's not cheap, until you
compare it to the competition: the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, and
Mitsubishi Galant.
</P>
<P>
   Venturing further, actually inserting key into driver's door,
the power locks opened and a surprisingly roomy interior was
revealed.
</P>
<P>
   If you get the idea I wasn't in an all-fired rush to take off
into Friday afternoon traffic, you're right.
</P>
<P>
   So we sat awhile, looking.
</P>
<P>
   Usually a few controls in an unfamiliar car will bring forth a
``Whuzzthatdo?'' but not this time.
</P>
<P>
   The Hyundai was designed intuitively. Controls were clearly
marked and where they should be. The heater buttons didn't appear
to be the sturdiest, but worked fine.
</P>
<P>
   I tried the back seat _ plenty of space for two adults of any
size. This clearly is shaping up as a reasonably-priced family
sedan.
</P>
<P>
   Still procrastinating, I grabbed the owner's manual, determined
to find a ``nugget'' to share with anyone still waiting for me to
take this car on the road.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, it was in the introduction, and we quote:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hyundai realizes that success in the American marketplace can
only be achieved by total commitment to customer satisfaction.
Consistent with this understanding Hyundai is endeavoring to insure
that its products receive the best public acceptance of any product
in automotive history.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai didn't get to be multinational manufacturing success by
building junk . . . even though their early American-market cars
are now mostly just that. And they recognized that the likes of me
weren't going to be eager to jump on their bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   And they're backing up those words.
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai is standing behind the Sonata with an unsurpassed _
especially for this segment of the market _ five-year, 60,000-mile
bumper-to-bumper warranty. All Hyundais now feature an eye-opening
drivetrain warranty of 10 years or 100,000 miles and body panel
rust-through warranty for 5 years or 100,000 miles. Plus, Hyundai
is offering a five-year roadside assistance plan, including towing
and lockout service.
</P>
<P>
   That's got to be an irresistible deal for those folks who live
their lives according to the dictums of financial gurus who buy a
car with the idea of driving it for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Now that we know we can be driving this car in 10 years, it's
time to turn the key and hit the road.
</P>
<P>
   And, guess what, just like that dreaded speech or trip to the
doctor, the anticipation was far worse than the reality.
</P>
<P>
   The V6 had plenty of zip and we had not a whit of difficulty
zipping around Morrissey Boulevard and up the ramp onto Route 93
northbound, melding smoothly with the inbound traffic towards
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   For once, the congestion isn't bad (everyone must be still
recovering from what the traffic reports had made out as a
certified ``worst day ever'' of a morning commute).
</P>
<P>
   The car warms up extremely quickly (a big plus in my book) and
the heater and defroster quickly melt what is left of my reluctance
to be on my way.
</P>
<P>
   This obviously isn't your father's Excel. All the
``mechanicals'' work just fine and the front-wheel drive proves
just fine in this winter's minor snows.
</P>
<P>
   A few nits to pick: The gear selector likes to slide past drive
to third when you engage the transmission and the seat belt warning
chimes are particularly annoying.
</P>
<P>
   Our 23.9 miles per gallon on a test tank falls right in the EPA
range of 20-29 mpg. Tip: Don't try to top off this tank. When the
gas nozzle clicks off, it's full.
</P>
<P>
   All of which brings us back to the lingering question: How far
will this Hyundai go and how reliable will it be?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe far enough and dependably enough to make Door 1 a good
choice. After all, Hyundai is willing to guarantee it.

WORKERS CAN IDENTIFY WITH AMUSING `OFFICE SPACE'  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's something pleasantly old-fashioned about the new Fox
comedy, ``Office Space,'' and it's even more of a surprise coming
from Mike Judge, the creator of TV's youth-oriented, animated
farces, ``Beavis and Butt-head'' and ``King of the Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   The film's theme is actually quite timely. It's an office comedy
set in a modern high-tech company, populated with a variety of
contemporary dysfunctional characters who have lost their souls
``sitting in tiny cubicles staring at computer screens.''
</P>
<P>
   But it has no ``Airplane'' visual absurdities, no Jim Jarmusch
deadpan, no Jim Carrey mugging, no gross-out, black or camp humor:
in fact, none of the many faces of '90s movie comedy. It's as
straight as ``I Love Lucy.'' A few four-letter words aside, it
could have been made in 1959, not 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Judge's ``Milton'' animated shorts, it's about Peter
(Ron Livingston), a lowly functionary at INITECH, a company that
makes a product no one can quite define, who loathes everything
about a job that requires absolutely no creativity and is
supervised by eight bosses.
</P>
<P>
   One day, something snaps in Peter. Suddenly, he no longer gives
a damn. He starts coming in late, wearing sweat shirts, acting
disrespectful of his superiors. When he's interviewed by a team of
efficiency consultants, he happily tells them the truth about his
senseless job.
</P>
<P>
   The joke is that this behavior is recognized by the team as
first-rate upper-management potential. And from here, as Peter
becomes even more drunk with irreverence, ``Office Space'' becomes
a caper comedy with Peter and his pals trying to rip off the
company with a scheme they borrow from the script of ``Superman
III.''
</P>
<P>
   With no stars (except Jennifer Aniston in a throwaway supporting
role) and a fairly predictable plot-line, the film often seems as
slight as one of Judge's animated shorts. If it has a drawback,
it's that it ``feels'' like a studio-era B-movie, something that
would appear on the bottom half of a double bill 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's amusing. It was a big disappointment to the Beavis
and Butt-head fans who sat behind me at the Seattle press preview,
and vocally expressed their opinion that the movie ``sucked.'' But
a more sophisticated audience will find its characters and
situations inventive and funny, if never quite a laugh riot.
</P>
<P>
   And it's also a film with which many people will identify on a
personal level. It's filled with computer rage and the absurdities
and injustice of office culture. No office worker of the '90s will
be able to resist the scene in which Peter and his two down-sized
pals steal an expensive copying machine that never seems to work,
and ritually pound it to smithereens. It makes terrific therapy for
the cubicle-ally oppressed.
</P>
<P>
   Office Space. Directed and written by Mike Judge. Cast: Ron
Livingston, Jennifer Aniston, David Herman, Ajay Naidu, Stephen
Root. 20th Century-Fox. 90 minutes. Rated R for language and sexual
references.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-

ELITE CALIFORNIA RETREAT A BOOT CAMP FOR THE STARS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Calif.) 
 
By CLIFFORD PUGH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALABASAS, Calif. _ The austere bedrooms make a Motel 6 look
glamorous.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartan meals _ orange juice for breakfast, soup for dinner
_ are hardly enough to feed a sparrow.
</P>
<P>
   The grueling schedule includes a daily 15-mile mountain hike
over terrain so steep that one stretch is known as ``Heartbreak
Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   And the cost _ $2,700 a week _ would cover a down payment on a
car.
</P>
<P>
   So why is the Ashram such a popular getaway spot for celebrities
who want to get in shape?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like going to war,'' said Anne Marie Bennstrom, founder
of the ``funky little place'' tucked in the hills above Los
Angeles. ``The most memorable part of your life is afterward, isn't
it?''
</P>
<P>
   Entertainer Barbra Streisand is said to have called the retreat
``a boot camp without food.'' Its guest list includes such notables
as pro basketball superstar Charles Barkley, talk-show host Oprah
Winfrey and model Cindy Crawford, who give up their lavish
lifestyles for a week in a no-frills house where participants bunk
with roommates and share bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell no, you don't get treated any different (as a
celebrity),'' Barkley, the outspoken Houston Rockets forward,
recalled recently. ``You get treated worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Barkley, who got off to a fast start in the NBA season
before injuring his knee, credits his newly found gung-ho attitude
to the retreat, where he took part in a weeklong program in
December.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ain't no joke,'' he said. ``Just hiking 15 miles every day
on an apple. I thought, boy, that was discipline there.''
</P>
<P>
   The 36-year-old basketball star said he lost 17 pounds while at
the Ashram and came away in excellent physical condition and with
more mental toughness. His doctors said his improved conditioning
would help him recover more quickly and effectively from
arthroscopic surgery performed Sunday on his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   The word ``ashram'' usually refers to a Hindu retreat where
religious meditation is practiced. But this ashram is different.
</P>
<P>
   While there are daily yoga classes in a geodesic dome, there is
little time for organized meditation. Instead, each day is filled
with a five-hour hike, weight training, water volleyball and one
treat _ a massage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could do more of the `spiritual aspect,' but the day is so
fully loaded with just playing and moving and being,'' said
Bennstrom, a charismatic 68-year-old whose motto is ``There is
nothing in life worth being serious about.''
</P>
<P>
   But a week at the Ashram is not many people's idea of play.
</P>
<P>
   When Dagny Shaw, a former Katy, Texas, resident who now lives in
Laguna Nigel, Calif., told friends she was going to a ``health
spa,'' they raved about the facials, pedicures, mudpacks and
pampering she would receive.
</P>
<P>
   But she knew better.
</P>
<P>
   And a friend who was familiar with the retreat's regimen told
her, ``I don't know anybody who would pay that kind of money for
that kind of abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Shaw's husband was worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your idea of camping out is going some place with room
service,'' he told her.
</P>
<P>
   When he realized she was determined to go, he filled her
suitcase with trail mix, beef jerky and energy bars so she wouldn't
starve on the 800-calorie-a-day mostly vegetarian diet.
</P>
<P>
   As she ended her time at the retreat, however, Shaw had eaten
only a couple of energy bars out of the stash. And despite hitting
a low on a particularly hard hike midweek, she was exuberant at
what she had accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've surprised and amazed myself,'' she said. ``Here I am 50,
and I can do what I couldn't do at 20. I did all sorts of things my
husband didn't think I could do, and I did them just fine, thank
you very much. Wouldn't he be surprised?''
</P>
<P>
   Bennstrom believes the program transforms people because it
presents them with challenges to overcome and gives them a sense of
accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am surprised myself because it's so simple,'' she said. ``It
is a no-frill fare, totally.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennstrom, who studied biochemistry and nutrition in her native
Sweden, developed the idea after coming to the United States and
working at the Golden Door health spa, where she taught aerobics to
Jane Fonda and invented the Thighmaster.
</P>
<P>
   She longed to create ``a little place with no mercy and no
compromise,'' but wasn't sure what form it would take until she
spent six months in the jungles of Guatemala. While there she
simplified her life, walked a lot and ate natural fruits.
</P>
<P>
   ``That taught me what I needed to do,'' she said. ``You need to
go away to find the answer for yourself sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   When she returned to California, she opened the Ashram in 1974
on a small piece of secluded property off a long dirt road about a
10-minute drive inland from Malibu Beach.
</P>
<P>
   She purposely limits the number of guests to those who would fit
into the five-bedroom house and out on the porch _ 12 people in all
_ and believes keeping the group small is the main reason the
program works.
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes a family that suffers and laughs and plays
together,'' she said. ``It becomes very much bonding.''
</P>
<P>
   But the bonding varies with the group. Barkley didn't mix much
with his crew, which included a number of Germans, some U.S.
businessmen and a couple of ``rich old ladies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a great mixture of people, but there ain't a lot of
talking going on there, just a lot of hunger and a lot of
tiredness.''
</P>
<P>
   Guests are encouraged to pack only underwear, socks, a bathing
suit and walking shoes. The retreat provides red sweats and Ashram
T-shirts for the trail and a robe for trips to the shower.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very simple, and that's what they love about it, don't
you think?'' Bennstrom said. ``It's walking on the trail and
reflecting on your life and wondering what you're here for in this
world and ... starting to feel good. When you do that, everything
falls into place.''
</P>
<P>
   But participants must make some mental adjustments. When Carrie
Angelakis had her first meal at the Ashram, she thought the salad
was fine and was waiting for the main course until she realized she
had just eaten dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so hungry I was ready to eat the roses on the table,''
said Angelakis, a 39-year-old mother of four who lives in Orange
County, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   But by the end of the week, she found that food was not so
important. Even the blisters on her feet from hiking more than 75
miles in six days didn't deter her enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing what a week does to your body,'' marveled
Angelakis, who has been to the retreat twice in less than a year.
``Even the whites of my eyes are whiter.''
</P>
<P>
   She found out about the retreat from her cousin, who quit after
two days because it was so grueling. But she was looking for a
challenge and had found other health spas too wimpy. At another
famous spa she could always convince employees to bring her more
food. But not at the Ashram.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no cheating,'' she said. ``You can't get an extra
scoop of hummus.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the severity, the place is booked several months in
advance (currently through May). Repeat customers like Angelakis
are common, which is one reason the program has been toughened up
over the years with longer hikes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Angelakis and Shaw, last week's group included
two members of a famous Dallas real estate family, the wife of the
president of one of the nation's most popular department stores,
the fashion editor of a trendy magazine and a model who will appear
on the cover of Vogue magazine in a few months.
</P>
<P>
   The model, who took cigarette breaks on her hikes, had come
because her agent told her she needed to lose weight before a major
photo shoot. She dropped 10 pounds but, of all the participants,
seemed the least sure it was worth the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the most energetic person in the world,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the week, the class was longing for more comforts
of the outside world. As the van drove them to the start of a
trail, they passed through Malibu, where the sight of a Starbucks
brought cries of longing. Coffee is not allowed at the Ashram.
</P>
<P>
   The leader for the day, Arun Wylie, joked that he might have to
blindfold them so they wouldn't see signs advertising strawberries,
shrimp and Big Macs.
</P>
<P>
   Most participants list losing weight, getting in shape and
pushing themselves to the limit as their goals, but Bennstrom
insists weight loss should be a secondary consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them you can put that (weight) on in a few days again.
But it is the feeling of expansion of self that makes a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Some change their lifestyles dramatically upon leaving the
retreat, but a lot don't. Barkley admitted he still smokes cigars
and stays out late if he feels like it. But he eats less fast food
and believes he is more disciplined.
</P>
<P>
   But couldn't he have done just as well with a trainer on his
own?
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't do that stuff on your own,'' he said. ``People don't
work out on their own. They only work out when people push them.''

JASPER JURY SHOWN RACIST, SATANIC TATTOOS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See JASPER-TRIAL) 
 
By RICHARD STEWART 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ John William ``Bill'' King is a walking gallery
of skin art _ prison-made tattoos ranging from reminders of time in
a particular prison to a demonic Woody Woodpecker peeking from
under a Klan hood and pointing to a black figure hanging from a
tree.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper Police Detective Rich Ford took the jury for a
photographic tour Wednesday of the tattoos of King and the other
two white men charged with dragging a black man, James Byrd Jr., to
death.
</P>
<P>
   There was little reaction in the courtroom other than an
occasional gasp as the racist and satanic tattoos were displayed.
</P>
<P>
   As defense attorneys lodged continuing protests, Ford used a
laser pointer to guide the jury through giant projected blow-ups of
the three men's tattoos _ mainly King's.
</P>
<P>
   King is festooned with figures, including an upside-down
pentagram on the back of his head. His arms are a melange of
figures, unintelligible except in close-ups.
</P>
<P>
   There are demonic figures, reproductions of Church of Satan
founder Anton LaVey preaching and goat heads. A Madonna holds what
looks like a baby Jesus with horns. Valentine hearts are turned
upside down _ a symbol of hate, Ford testified.
</P>
<P>
   There are several allusions to ``peckerwoods,'' a name Ford said
stands for white men in prison. One tattoo says ``100 percent loco
wood,'' and another reads ``PWCCA,'' standing for Peckerwood
Confederate Coalition of America, Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   On one arm is the wild-eyed, demonic-looking, hooded woodpecker
pointing to one of the smallest drawings in the nightmare mixture
of ink. It is a tiny figure of a black man hanging from a tree.
</P>
<P>
   One tattoo may predict King's future if the jury convicts him of
capital murder _ it is of playing cards showing aces and eights,
the traditional dead man's poker hand.
</P>
<P>
   Another tells of his past _ it is a dragon emblazoned with
``Beto I'' _ the Texas prison unit where he got most of the tattoos
while incarcerated there from 1995 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagrams _ a five-pointed star inside a circle _ itself a sign
of evil, and its upside-down and even worse version, the bathomet,
is found on the back of his scalp.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray introduced a
life-sized photograph of King holding his left arm up, displaying a
bathomet in his left armpit.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said the tattoos show that the men _ especially King and
former prison buddy Lawrence Russell Brewer Jr., were racists and
were in a frame of mind to kill a black man.
</P>
<P>
   Both King and Brewer have large crests symbolizing the
Confederate Knights of America _ a Klan-related prison group they
both belonged to. On Tuesday, prosecutors introduced King's
writings found in his apartment that showed he was forming a
Klan-type group called Texas Rebel Soldiers, an offshoot of the
Confederate Knights of America.
</P>
<P>
   Their tattooed shields include Confederate-style stars and bars,
blazing crosses, Nazi-style ``SS'' lightning bolts and the slogan,
``Aryan Pride.''
</P>
<P>
   Brewer has almost as many tattoos, including one that looks like
a pirate, a patch over one eye, his lips sewn shut and a rope
around his neck.
</P>
<P>
   A sort of white supremacy time line winds around one arm, with
Norsemen giving way to pirates, then cowboys and modern-day bikers,
Ford explained.
</P>
<P>
   One tattoo reads ``CKA,'' meaning Confederate Knights of America
and ``Death before dishonor.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared to the other two, Shawn Allen Berry's tattoos are mild.
</P>
<P>
   He has a death's head in a three-horned helmet, emblazoned with
the slogan, ``Brotherhood.'' He also has a grim reaper, but no
tattoos that indicated Klan-like sympathies.
</P>
<P>
   Among items introduced Wednesday was a King mimic of the 23rd
Psalm that he called ``The Psalm of Tattoos.'' It began:
</P>
<P>
   King Tattoo is my shepard, (sic) I shall always want
</P>
<P>
   He maketh me be stung by the needle
</P>
<P>
   He coloreth me with the evil waters
</P>
<P>
   He remaketh my soul
</P>
<P>
   King's attorneys said the tattoos were protected by their
client's first-amendment right to free expression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think just the tattoos themselves make him a racist,''
said King's attorney, C. Haden ``Sonny'' Cribbs Jr.

<HEADLINE>
MS DRUGS CENTER OF A NATIONAL BATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; It used to take Allan Bowlby five excruciating minutes to
button his shirt. Bowlby's hands and limbs were ravaged by multiple
sclerosis. He had difficulty walking. Completely demoralized, he
talked to his employer about retiring early or taking a disability
leave.
</P>
<P>
   Then in the mid-1990s, he started taking Rebif, which at the
time was an experimental drug developed by Serono Laboratories Inc.
in Norwell, Mass. ``It was a little short of a miracle,'' Bowlby, a
computer consultant in Attleboro, said of the drug. ``Now I feel
normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Rebif, however, is not available in the United States because it
has not been approved for sale here by the US Food and Drug
Administration. To get the drug, Bowlby makes pilgrimages into his
native Canada, where Rebif is approved for sale, for his six-month
supply.
</P>
<P>
   That's just fine with Biogen Inc., whose executives prefer that
Rebif were kept off pharmacist shelves in the United States until
2003. The reason: Biogen makes a drug called Avonex, which is
chemically identical to Serono's Rebif. Biogen in 1996 won
exclusive rights from the FDA to sell Avonex in the United States
under the Orphan Drug Act, a designation that is supposed to
prevent identical drugs from competing with Avonex for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Biogen executives call Rebif ``an inferior knockoff'' of Avonex.
Just 25 miles away from Biogen's Cambridge, Mass. headquarters,
Serono executives in Norwell strenuously disagree, saying Rebif
provides ``significant advantages'' over Avonex and should be
approved for sale here.
</P>
<P>
   The verbal fisticuffs are about more than semantics. At stake is
a $500 million annual market for multiple sclerosis treatments in
the United States, a market that Biogen currently shares with just
one other pharmaceutical company. Wall Street analysts say the
market could easily grow to $1 billion within a few years.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Bowlby and more than 300,000 people in America
who suffer from multiple sclerosis await word from the FDA, which
is expected to decide in the next several weeks whether to allow
Rebif into the United States. Many of them, including Bowlby, say
they want the ability to judge the drugs for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Multiple sclerosis strikes about 200 additional people in
America each week. At first, symptoms are subtle. There is
temporary blurred vision, then a slight tingling in the hands.
Other symptoms include dizziness and a loss of balance. Often, the
signs are so mild, they can be dismissed as fatigue. Many people
with multiple sclerosis live normally for years.
</P>
<P>
   For some, however, the disease gradually becomes more
pronounced. Muscle spasms, slurred speech, vision loss, and
weakness in the limbs are common developments. Simple tasks _
buttoning a shirt, walking, opening a medicine bottle _ become
maddeningly difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Many patients describe MS as a ``short circuit'' in the brain.
In fact, it's a breakdown in the protective coating, the myelin
sheath, that surround nerves.
</P>
<P>
   There is no cure for multiple sclerosis. Instead, there are a
number of treatments that help delay the disease's progress,
including beta interferons. In 1993, the FDA approved Betaseron, a
form of beta interferon produced by Berlin-based Schering AG and
its US affiliate, Berlex Laboratories in Richmond, Calif. In 1995,
the FDA approved Avonex, also a beta interferon, produced by
Biogen.
</P>
<P>
   Betaseron and Avonex were approved under the Orphan Drug Act,
which was passed by Congress in 1983 to encourage pharmaceutical
companies to develop drugs for rare diseases. Because treatment for
illnesses that affect relatively few people can be unprofitable,
Congress tucked in several incentives in the Orphan Drug Act to
entice companies to research and to develop drugs for such
diseases. The most important incentive is the exclusive right to
market the drug for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   There are exceptions. If a new drug is safer, more effective, or
provides a ``major contribution to patient care,'' it is allowed on
the market. Avonex itself was allowed on the market because Biogen
was able to demonstrate to the FDA that it was safer than
Betaseron. Patients who used Avonex were less likely than Betaseron
users to develop skin ulcers from the injections, according to Dr.
Burt Adelman, vice president of medical research at Biogen.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes Rebif, developed by Serono Laboratories, a US
affiliate of the Ares-Serono Group, a Geneva-based pharmaceutical
company.
</P>
<P>
   After spending nine years and nearly $150 million developing
Rebif, Serono has launched a major campaign to convince the FDA and
the public that its product, Rebif, is clinically superior to
Avonex, even though the two are chemically identical.
</P>
<P>
   Hisham Samra, Serono's president, said three things set Rebif
apart. The first is that it was tested at much higher doses than
Avonex. Samra said studies suggest higher doses are more effective
at combatting multiple sclerosis. Second, Rebif comes pre-mixed in
syringes, ready for injection. Avonex users must mix that drug with
sterile water before injecting. Finally, Avonex must be injected
directly into muscle, while Rebif is injected under the skin, a
method Samra maintains is more comfortable for patients.
</P>
<P>
   To further its cause, Serono asked politicians to write to the
FDA on its behalf, including Senator John F. Kerry and
Representative Henry A. Waxman, who was principal author of the
Orphan Drug Act. In addition, Serono's Canadian sister company
placed ads in the January issue of a major medical journal, Annals
of Neurology, to promote Rebif.
</P>
<P>
   All this has Biogen fuming.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been very displeased with the way they've been
approaching this,'' said Michael Astrue, vice president and general
counsel of Biogen. ``We didn't spend million of dollars on
legislative lobbying, getting patients to call the agency, on
deceptive advertising. They've really tried to mislead patients
into thinking that there's some new therapy out there when there's
not. I think that's very sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling Rebif an ``inferior knockoff'' of Avonex, Astrue said
the two drugs are identical ``from a biochemical perspective.'' He
also attacked Serono's claim that higher doses of the drug are
better. ``They really have no science to back that up,'' said
Astrue.
</P>
<P>
   Astrue accused Serono of flouting FDA rules banning
advertisements of drugs that are not yet approved by the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Serono officials said the ad promoting Rebif was properly placed
by its sister company in Canada, where Rebif has been approved for
sale. Samra also said that patients are better served if there are
more choices of drugs available.
</P>
<P>
   In the medical community, opinions on the matter differ.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any of us can say one is better than the other,
because the clinical trials were designed so differently,'' said
Dr. William McIlroy, the national medical director for the Multiple
Sclerosis Society of Canada. ``What everyone here is saying is that
we'll never know unless there is a head-to-head trial of the two
drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Others believe having a drug approved for a higher dose can help
patients. Dr. Paul O'Connor, director of the Multiple Sclerosis
Clinic at St. Michael's Hospital at the University of Toronto in
Ontario, who prescribes both Rebif and Avonex to his patients,
said: ``The real issue is the dose. There are studies that seem to
indicate higher doses are better, especially if the patient has
more disability.''
</P>
<P>
   Rebif comes in doses of up to 132 micrograms per week in Canada,
while Avonex is approved for only 30 micrograms per week in Canada
and the US.
</P>
<P>
   Why not just prescribe double or triple doses of Avonex?
O'Connor pointed out that the Canadian insurance system pays for
only one dose. Extra prescriptions can be prohibitive. Better to go
with Rebif, said O'Connor. ``There's a practical tendency to make
sure that the patient is covered by receiving enough drugs,'' said
O'Connor, who has done research for both Biogen and Serono.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the FDA has refused to comment on the Rebif
application. The agency is expected to issue its decree on the drug
within the next few weeks, according to Serono officials.
</P>
<P>
   The financial stakes are huge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Avonex is extremely vital to Biogen,'' said David Molowa, a
biotechnology analyst with Bear, Stearns in New York. ``It is
Biogen's primary source of revenue and earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, 71 percent of Biogen's $558 million annual revenues
came from Avonex, which Biogen spent a decade and $250 million to
develop.
</P>
<P>
   For Allan Bowlby, the FDA's decision will also have its
consequences. Because he was part of a clinical trial, Bowlby gets
free supplies of Rebif until the end of this year. Next year, if
Rebif is not approved in the United States, Bowlby will either move
back to Canada, or switch to Avonex or Betaseron.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never tried Avonex,'' said Bowlby. ``The results I got
with Rebif were so positive that I quite frankly have no incentive
to switch to anything else.''

SMALL BANKS SAY ATM FEES HAVEN'T HURT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Massachusetts' big banks began charging noncustomers to use
their automated teller machines last fall, two big fears were
raised: that consumers would be gouged and that small banks would
lose customers to the big guys.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to be precise on the first count, but consumers
apparently have reacted to the fees much the way they have to
President Clinton's personal scandals: They don't like them, but
they have learned to live with them.
</P>
<P>
   On the second count, however, the early evidence is clear:
Small-bank customers are staying put.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to lose any customers and we don't think we
have,'' said James McDonough, president of Abington Savings Bank, a
small South Shore bank.
</P>
<P>
   Executives from other small and midsize banks say the same
thing: They are hearing no complaints about the fees from
customers, defections are few and far between, and life goes on
much as before. ``The whole thing hasn't been an issue,'' said John
McCarthy, president of the tiny Wakefield Cooperative Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that customers would vote with their feet
certainly seemed real last year when the Legislature wrestled with
the ATM question. The logic was straightforward: If Fleet Financial
Group Inc. and BankBoston Corp. started levying fees on
noncustomers, people would be in a real bind. The two big banks,
after all, control 65 percent of the state's ATM machines. Rather
than pay the fees, the thinking went, customers would flock to join
the big banks. And when the Legislature refused to block the fees,
bowing to the influence of House Speaker Thomas Finneran, the small
banks prepared for the worst.
</P>
<P>
   Why were the pessimists wrong? For one thing, they
underestimated the power of inertia. Changing banks is a pain in
the neck; people don't switch unless they are seriously annoyed.
The pessimists may also have overestimated the importance of ATM
machines to small-bank customers. In a study he did for the
Massachusetts Bankers Association in April, economist Edward
Moscovitch found that only about 5 percent of the state's
small-bank customers were heavy users of the ATM networks run by
the biggest banks. Only 30 percent of small-bank customers even use
ATM cards regularly, Moscovitch discovered.
</P>
<P>
   But the little banks haven't just been lucky. They've also been
smart. Shut out of the club by the two big banks, they created
their own, the SUM network. Banks that join agree not to levy ATM
fees on the customers of other member banks. Think of it as a
tariff-free zone or a mutual nonaggression pact. The SUM machines
are marked by little yellow signs. Organized only last October,
mainly through the efforts of the Massachusetts Bankers
Association, the network includes 200 banks and 1,200 ATM machines.
BankBoston, by contrast, has about 1,500 machines in Massachusetts;
Fleet has nearly 500.
</P>
<P>
   Participating banks seem delighted by the new network's early
success. ``It's a good example of the free market at work,'' said
Mark Primeau, executive vice president of Eastern Bank in Lynn.
According to Primeau, consumers are actually changing their
behavior and seeking out the SUM machines. Preliminary numbers
gathered by NYCE, the New Jersey company that handles the
electronic side of the operation, show that the average monthly
traffic on the SUM machines has increased nearly 40 percent since
the program was launched. Consumers, apparently, will go out of
their way, at least a little, to save a buck. (BankBoston charges a
$1 fee; Fleet charges 75 cents).
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers are more intelligent than we give them credit,''
said McCarthy of the Wakefield Coop.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence gathered from other states where ATM fees have been
imposed suggests consumers are ducking the fees in other ways. They
are taking out more money each time they visit a machine and they
are getting cash back when they use debit cards at the supermarket.
And sometimes, when they haven't planned ahead, they are getting
stuck paying the fee. That can be incredibly galling, but not
galling enough to make most of us look for another bank.
</P>
<P>
   Politically the issue is not as charged as it once was. No one
today is quite as steamed as former state Senator Paul White, who
in 1997 declared: ``Nobody should have to pay for the right to use
an ATM machine,'' apparently putting free ATM use in a league with
``life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   Still there are a number of bills pending in the Legislature
that would ban the fees, and it is hard to predict if the issue
will resurface. Based on their experience in the post-fee era,
executives from small banks suggest the Legislature should find
something else to do.
</P>
<P>
   Said Primeau of Eastern Bank: ``Anyone who says customers are
being held hostage by these fees is sorely mistaken.''

HARD REALITY UN-VAILED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ski fans will have plenty of different highlights to remember in
the recently completed World Alpine Championships in Vail, but it
is likely everyone will remember the same low point.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the competition, the US Ski Team had little in the
way of prospects, what with the retirement of Tommy Moe, AJ Kitt,
Hillary Lindh, and the disabling of Picabo Street.
</P>
<P>
   Bode Miller, the 21-year-old from Carrabasset Valley Academy,
was only a remote hope for a medal, as was Chad Fleischer and a
trio of 19-year-old women.
</P>
<P>
   So the one hope was slalom specialist Kristina Koznick, who was
second in the World Cup slalom standings a year ago and had a
legitimate reason to think she would do well before her home fans.
In fact, Saturday, the morning of the race, Koz woke up thinking,
``In a few hours, I'll have a medal around my neck.''
</P>
<P>
   The huge crowd of fans on hand that morning to see her first run
had their American flags out and were eagerly looking forward to
blowing horns and clanging cowbells at the Austrians, who had
dominated the games.
</P>
<P>
   The roar went up as Koznick kicked out of the start, and 16
seconds later, it was over. A sudden slip, an edge break, she was
down and out of competition. A hush fell over the crowd, which sat
there stunned, watching Koz pick herself up and, looking
bewildered, ski down the hill. The quiet was, one fan said, ``kind
of spooky.''
</P>
<P>
   A few people in the crowd shed tears openly, as did Koznick,
who, much to her credit, stuck in there trying to explain what had
happened to an insistent press crush around her. ``I don't know
what happened; I just don't know,'' said the 24-year-old from
Burnsveille, Minn. ``I just couldn't believe it. I wanted to go
back up and start over.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, perhaps the whole US effort would like to start the
games over. Except for the '92 Worlds when Gulf War politics kept
them from traveling, the team has won at least one medal every
year.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the '88 Olympics in Calgary, in fact, has the team
been skunked in a big international competition. They were so bad
in Calgary and in subsequent years leading to the Lillehammer games
that Sports Illustrated ran its now famous ``lead-footed snowplow
brigade'' preview story.
</P>
<P>
   Famous because the first skier in the first race of the games,
Tommy Moe, won a gold medal, setting the tone for the biggest US
Olympics _ five medals _ in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   This result created the enduring myth that US skiers may not do
much in World Cup, but they ``rise to the big events.'' The problem
for Koznick was that this myth has been repeated so often, people _
including herself _ assumed it's true.
</P>
<P>
   When she woke up on race day thinking about wearing a medal in a
few hours, Koz had bought into the notion that her talent and
training (she is among the very best slalom skiers in the world)
would somehow merge with a home-field advantage and the notion that
she is overdue for a major-event medal. That, and the fact she
skied out in Nagano should have taught her something, hardened her
to veteran status.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention the two weeks of hype. Since this was her one
serious event, the daily press update was a kind of countdown to
Koz day. In some way, she acknowledges, Koznick had come to think
she deserved a medal.
</P>
<P>
   Of course she knew _ everyone knows _ slalom is the event in
which skiers are most likely not to finish. In terms of injuries
it's not as dangerous as the faster races that don't require half
the turns. It's a little like boxing, Phil Mahre used to say.
Mistakes are relatively easy to make. An average two-run slalom has
maybe 90 turns, each of them a potential catch of a tip, loss of an
edge, twist by a gate.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, that Koznick had been set up for a huge letdown is not
as bad as the well publicized criticism from Ski Team management
the day after her race.
</P>
<P>
   ``No excuses,'' fumed US Ski and Snowboard president Bill
Marrolt. ``We did not perform. We underachieved. This is our lowest
point of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Marrolt did not exactly single out Koznick by name, but coming
the day after the race in which a medal was perhaps too heavily
expected, the entire bag of bile broke right over Koznick, who made
the rueful comment: ``Apparently, another day will come.''
</P>
<P>
   Koznick added that she hopes some of the young hopefuls _
Caroline Lalive, Sarah Schlepper, Alex Shaffer, Jonna Mendes, and
Katie Monahan _ develop fast, and take some of the pressure off her
head. But judging from competition last week, the youngsters on the
team have a long way to develop before they'll be skiing at top
elite levels, if they ever get there.
</P>
<P>
   And meanwhile, Americans find themselves in a familiar spot:
looking at a dismal record in the last few years, broken only
temporarily, it seems, when a Picabo Street or Tommy Moe come
breaking out of no where.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Marrolt may be right: ``You can't just invent
the talent. Either the skiers are there or they're not.''
</P>
<P>
   We need not here point out the painfully obvious.

BALSAMS GUESTS BASK ON FINE TRAILS, LUXURIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DIXVILLE NOTCH, N.H. _ One of the many luxuries of cross-country
skiing at the Balsams Wilderness resort in the Great North Woods
here is that you can have perfectly groomed trails all to yourself.
</P>
<P>
   In our two days of exploring the 85-kilometer trail system, with
views so dramatic they call this area the ``Switzerland of
America,'' we encountered only four other skiers.
</P>
<P>
   The other luxuries we experienced while staying at the four-star
hotel: gourmet meals, well-appointed rooms, and great service.
</P>
<P>
   The Balsams Wilderness, which Ski Magazine includes on its top
12 list of the world's poshest ski hotels, knows how to pamper its
guests, whether their winter sport of choice is cross-country or
downhill skiing, snowshoeing, or just sitting around a roaring
fireplace.
</P>
<P>
   And the fact that we visited midweek during the first plentiful
snow of this season, with relatively few other guests around, made
us feel even more spoiled. The resort, one of the last remaining
grand hotels from a bygone era, lets midweek visitors make free and
unlimited use of trails even after noon checkout on their day of
departure.
</P>
<P>
   We stayed at the resort as part of a weeklong cross-country
skiing vacation, after having read for years about the destination.
We knew a visit to the Balsams, nearly five hours north of Boston,
could not be squeezed into a regular weekend and had to be
specially planned.
</P>
<P>
   We were not disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   From the bellhop who took our luggage and showed us our room, to
the prime rib dinner with all the fixings, we felt we were in the
lap of luxury.
</P>
<P>
   Even the snow and trail conditions were perfect.
</P>
<P>
   We hit the trails in the early afternoon the day of our arrival.
Several inches of powdery snow had fallen the night before, and few
other skiiers had gotten on the trails since they were groomed that
morning.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, we saw only four other skiiers during the course of our
four-hour, 14-kilometer ski that day, much to our delight. We were
the only ones to have made it to the most remote part of the trails
that day, judging by the unmarred tracks, and we had the trail
system's strategically placed warming hut all to ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   As we came out of the hut, we encountered one of those skiers, a
local who holds a season pass to the Balsams' trails. He had left a
package of crackers a few days earlier in the warming hut, with a
note asking other skiers to feed the birds, and asked us if the
crackers were still there. ``The Canadian jays will eat right out
of your hands,'' he told us.
</P>
<P>
   The jays had to wait for another day, though, since we had
kilometers to go, before it got too late.
</P>
<P>
   Being advanced intermediate skiers, we inevitably gravitate
toward the more challenging trails, so we headed to the remote
Sugar Hill Run, considered a more difficult trail. But we were a
little disappointed that afternoon at the slow conditions coming
down.
</P>
<P>
   About half of Balsams' cross-country trails are in the more
difficult and most difficult categories and the rest are considered
easy, giving skiers of all levels plenty to choose from. While most
of the trails lead from the hotel door, another set of
cross-country trails are at the Balsams' downhill ski area, across
Route 26.
</P>
<P>
   We had better luck getting a fast run the next morning, when we
took the most difficult Peregrine trail, on our way to what is
considered one of the most scenic spots along the trail system, the
Panorama Golf Clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   This day, we saw no other skier, just the groomer setting
tracks. The main trail out to the clubhouse, closed for the winter,
is an easy route along an unplowed road, with the Peregrine side
trail offering a challenging alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the skies were overcast when we got to the
panorama. On clear days, we were told, you can see the mountains of
Vermont and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Later, we drove over to the other side of the trail system, by
the downhill ski area, to check out the facilities. We were too
exhausted to put the skis on again, but we thoroughly enjoyed the
relaxing, laidback atmosphere of the downhill ski lodge. Being
midweek, there were few people there.
</P>
<P>
   We stayed only one night at the Balsams, since we didn't want to
get pampered too much, but got two full days worth of skiing and
plenty of royal treatment. A one-night stay in winter starts at
about $150 per person, double occupancy, plus tax and service
charge, and includes dinner, breakfast, and free, unlimited use of
the facilities. The resort also provides free child care to guests,
nightly entertainment, and a host of other activities.
</P>
<P>
   The resort, under the same management since 1971, treats its
employees like family, who in turn treat guests like one of their
own. In the dining room, we had a table reserved with our name and
were served by the same waitress for both dinner and breakfast. The
only thing to remember is that dinner is a dressy affair, with
jackets required for men, and informal evening wear for women. A
breakfast buffet is offered every morning, in addition to the a la
carte menu. For dinner, there is sometimes a grand buffet.
</P>
<P>
   We wished the resort had an indoor pool and a hot tub, however.
After a long cross-country trek, we usually like to take a swim and
relax in a hot tub. The two most luxurious rooms at the hotel, the
Tower and the 1896 suites, do have their own private hot tubs,
however, and the resort offers an outdoor pool in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   We enjoyed reading about the history and traditions of the
Balsams and roaming the common areas of this historic hotel, from
the library to the TV room. The resort was established in 1866 as a
small summer inn and expanded over the years to accommodate 400
guests.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel has two distinctive wings _ the New England style
Dixville House, with its white clapboard and shutters, and the
European-style Hampshire House, the first concrete and steel
structure ever built in New Hampshire. And, with its surrounding
15,000 acres, the resort is larger than the island of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In a time-honored tradition, on the night of the nation's first
presidential state primary, the hotel's Ballot Room serves as the
voting place for Dixville Notch, the first community to report its
polling results.
</P>
<P>
   We enjoyed our experience at the Balsams and would go back
again. There are still many trails we haven't explored. And,
chances are, with the resort so far north, there will be good
cross-country skiing to be had there late into the season.

BIG BROTHER IS RINGING 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In the late spring of 1992, I was riding in a
rental car with a friend on a two-lane country road in the gentle
foothills that lead to Chamonix, France.
</P>
<P>
   We rounded a bend and the greenest, most gorgeous meadow _
grazing sheep and all _ came into view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pull over,'' I told my friend. ``I have to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a handful of other spots that I've happened upon and
occupied for a fraction of my life _ there was a beach, 27 years
ago, on the north coast of Crete _ the French meadow had stirred in
me a profound sense of peace. I needed to stand in it and stop
time.
</P>
<P>
   Not a believer in reincarnation, I have nevertheless felt in
such places as though I'd somehow ``come home.''
</P>
<P>
   I mention all this because I saw a billboard not long ago that
featured a pastoral scene very much like the one I found in France.
My eyes sucked in the pristine countryside. My ears could ``hear''
the peace. Then I read the billboard's printed message: ``Wherever
you're going _ we're already there.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an advertisement for cellular phone service.
</P>
<P>
   Say it ain't so. This portrait of natural perfection, this
heavenly respite from the daily grind _ and ``they'' already had
invaded it. Worse, by their presence, they had made the spot about
as special and bucolic as a sports arena.
</P>
<P>
   I felt like Zippy the Pinhead when he's stunned into chanting
some stupid slogan, over and over. Wherever you're going, we're
already there. Wherever you're going, we're ...
</P>
<P>
   Satellites are up there now. By the hundreds, they circle the
globe, receiving and transmitting signals, shoving ``civilization''
into every corner of the Earth and transforming each special nook
into just another scenic overlook on the communications highway.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever you're going, you can't escape.
</P>
<P>
   Last month I read a depressing travel feature about how cruise
ships have turned themselves inside out to accommodate
communications-addicted passengers. While ship-to-shore phone
service is still extremely expensive, savvy cruise lines now offer
e-mail and fax services, 24-hour-a-day CNN and ESPN, on-line
newspapers and laptops for rent.
</P>
<P>
   One cruise line has a financial fax that allows passengers to
keep daily tabs on dozens of stocks and mutual funds while they're
kicking back and chilling out at sea. The service includes business
roundups from the Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   You know it's only a matter of time before ``they'' find a way
to shove cheap cell phone technology into the maritime mix.
</P>
<P>
   At last count (an hour ago?) there were some 65 million cell
phone users in the United States alone, blabbing $30 billion worth
of business a year. Another 15 million Americans are expected to
hook up this year; at least 110 million should be using cell phones
by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   While it is true that no law dictates I must join this insanity
_ not yet, anyway _ I do have to live in it. To the dark forces of
the cell phone I already have surrendered restaurants, bars, shops,
the city's sidewalks and public parks and my personal safety in a
car.
</P>
<P>
   Now I know that, no matter where I go, I've already surrendered
that peaceful space, too. In the foothills of Chamonix, on the
beaches of Crete, at the depths of the Black Sea or the summit of
Everest, ``they'' are there.
</P>
<P>
   If reincarnation does exist, is this their way of telling me to
``call home''?

TWISS CUTS OUT MIDDLE MAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I am envious of Jeff Twiss. OK, I said it. Why lie? Twiss has
been the Celtics' public relations director for 18 years. He is
from Vergennes, Vt., famous for being the smallest city in America.
He's a nice guy. He had been cool with me until Wednesday night,
when I realized I have issues with the man. Am I bitter? Not yet.
But in this self-diagnosis, it's only fair to admit to jealousy.
</P>
<P>
   Twiss was 3,000 miles, another country, and three time zones
away from Boston. The Celtics played the Grizzlies in Vancouver,
British Columbia. That's not the bothersome part. Vancouver is a
beautiful city, but I don't miss it in February and I certainly
don't miss the $7 tax you have to pay before you leave the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Here's where my pettiness takes over: Twiss (play-by-play) and
Cedric Maxwell (color commentary) handled the radio broadcast for
Boton station WEEI. Part of Twiss's regular job is to distribute
mostly favorable team information to the media. So you will never
see a Celtics press release dogging Pervis Ellison or questioning
the team's giveaway of Eric Williams. There are annoying media and
fans for that.
</P>
<P>
   Twiss was both PR man and media man. Most of the time, people
criticize you for being on both sides of an issue. For one night,
Twiss was paid for it. How beautiful is that? How could you not be
envious?
</P>
<P>
   And if that weren't enough, Twiss's night of double duty seemed
like it would never end. Triple overtime. A game nearly four hours
long. Unbelievable.
</P>
<P>
   I'd actually pay to be in Twiss's dual position. For example, as
a reporter paid to cover the Red Sox, I'd question the moves of Dan
Duquette and John Harrington. And when I got bored with that, I'd
come back as a Sox PR man and put out a press release, bashing the
media for being irresponsible, reactionary, inaccurate and, most
important, painfully bad dressers.
</P>
<P>
   I'd use football to boost my self-esteem. So as a Patriots
reporter, I'd tell you that ``team sources'' say that Dave
Wohlabaugh could be headed to the Cleveland Browns because the
Patriots have no money. And then I'd put out a terse press release
the next day: ``As the brilliant Globe reporter wrote Wednesday,
we're broke. We don't have a center, running back, or punter. And
our best receiver is recovering from a broken ankle. See you in the
fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Twiss said before's game that he didn't plan to abuse his
considerable power. In fact, he acknowledged that if he had to,
he'd bite his tongue before telling New England radio listeners the
intimate secrets of the Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got that right,'' he said. ``This is a one-shot deal. I
don't want to stick my size 11s in my mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   So if two Celtics had been unable to play because they had
injured themselves popping each other upside the head, Twiss The
Media Man would have had to morph into Twiss The PR Man. You love
to hear about tales of chaos when you're a reporter; you learn to
convert chaos into euphemism when you're in PR.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, it wasn't uncommon for pro teams to have their
PR people simultaneously handle media roles. Howie McHugh, the
Celtics' first PR director, used to do commentary with the
legendary Johnny Most. During one game in Philadelphia, McHugh
learned working with Most could be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, a heckler was irritating Most while he tried to
describe the action between Wilt Chamberlain and Bill Russell. So
Most told McHugh to tell the fan he'd punch him out at halftime if
he didn't shut up. McHugh turned and recognized the fan. It was
Joey Giardello, a middleweight boxer who, according to a Globe
story ``was once sentenced to six to 18 months in jail for
participating in the beating of a gas station attendant.'' After
learning who was making all the noise, Most decided that the
heckling was not so bad after all.
</P>
<P>
   It also wasn't unusual for reporters to do PR. Longtime Globe
readers may remember the late Herb Ralby, who covered the Bruins
while also being the team's director of publicity. You can look in
the Bruins' 1970-71 media guide _ the season after they won the
Stanley Cup _ and see Ralby listed as PR director. During that same
time, he also wrote a column called Off The Cuff.
</P>
<P>
   Twiss doesn't have any plans to be The Slash of media and PR.
``I don't want to be the next Howard David or Johnny Most,'' he
said. He found himself in a broadcast position only after David,
the team's regular broadcaster, had a death in his family. When
WEEI program director Jason Wolfe learned of that, he began looking
for replacements. He got former 'EEI personality Sean Grande for
Tuesday's game in Sacramento. Dave Shore, who worked with Rick
Pitino at the University of Kentucky, will do Friday's game in
Portland, Ore. But there was a hole for Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Boston broadcaster Ted Sarandis was not available. Neither was
Boston's Sean McDonough. Doug Brown had a TV commitment with
Channel 68-TV in Boston. Finally, Twiss spoke up. He was on the
mike when the University of Vermont upset Ohio State in 1977, but
that was it. Shortly after, Twiss was preparing to brush off 20
years of radio rust, no catch-phrases necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't, as Johnny would say, fiddle and diddle,'' he said.
``One thing Red (Auerbach) told me long ago was that there are two
things people care about on radio: what's the score and how much
time is left?''
</P>
<P>
   So there was Twiss, getting advice from four-year veteran
Maxwell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an easy job,'' Maxwell said. ``In baseball, you have
enough time to talk about your grandma, what kind of pie she made,
and what kind of pie her grandma made. Basketball, you have to make
your points quick and get outta there.''
</P>
<P>
   Twiss did that. Then he went back to his day job. I'm still
envious. I'd feel better if I came in the office one day and they
told me I was also the guy in charge of bonuses.
</P>

WOHLABAUGH: NO SNAP DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Former Patriots center Dave Wohlabaugh admits, unlike
many athletes, that he listens to radio talk shows and reads the
newspapers. And lately he hasn't liked what he's heard or read.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are just some things that I've said that have been
manipulated and twisted and turned,'' said Wohlabaugh, who signed a
seven-year, $24.6 million deal with the Cleveland Browns Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, it bothered me when I read that the Patriots
didn't do everything they could to sign me after my talks with the
Browns had broken down on Saturday. My wife and I had left
Cleveland knowing this is where we wanted to play because the
proximity of this area to our family and the fact that we really
enjoyed the area, but at the time there was no signing bonus in the
contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not more than a half hour after I got home that night, Pete
(Carroll) was on the phone with me and asked me what happened and
what the Patriots could do. I told him that we would start
negotiating with him on Monday because Cleveland had fallen
through. Between my agent (Alan Herman) and me, we talked to Pete,
Bobby Grier, and Bob Kraft. They showed me all kinds of attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what happened was about four hours later, the Browns came
up with the signing bonus and we took the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Wohlabaugh said that he never wanted to pit the Patriots against
the Browns. ``The Patriots did everything they could possibly do,''
said Wohlabaugh. ``I felt they would have worked out a deal for me
had we not accepted the Cleveland deal and we would have gone back
to New England.''
</P>
<P>
   Wohlabaugh had trips planned for New Orleans and Miami, but he
said he had no real intention of considering those teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things that really bother me from what I've heard
and I just wanted to clear them up,'' he said. ``The other thing
was that I left because I didn't like Pete. That's the furthest
thing from the truth. I enjoyed playing for Pete and I respected
him. There are a lot of players in my boat on that one. He's an
excellent coach, and I think the future will show that.''
</P>
<P>
   Wohlabaugh said he has complete faith in Heath Irwin as his
replacement if the Patriots don't look elsewhere, and said
second-year center Jason Andersen, a seventh-round draft pick from
Brigham Young, also could do the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason is a big, strong kid who already knows the offense and
the signals,'' Wohlabaugh said. ``What he, like all of us who first
start out, have to learn is the technique of the position. Heath,
too, knows the offense. What he has to do is learn to play with one
hand more and just get better technique as a center because he's
spent most of his career as a guard.''

COPYRIGHTS AND WRONGS

 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A little more than a decade ago, Lotus Development Corp.
reinvented the spreadsheet. A small group of developers at the
company's Advanced Technology Group, including Pito Salas, Paul
Kleppner, and Lynda Urgotis, started with the mission of making
spreadsheets dramatically easier to use.
</P>
<P>
   A big problem that many people have building complicated
spreadsheets, they realized, was organizing the data. What should
go in the horizontal rows? What should go in the vertical columns?
Spreadsheets like Microsoft Excel and Lotus 1-2-3 allow users to
put any number or any formula in any cell on a huge two-dimensional
array. Unfortunately, for most users, that flexibility provides
more power than is needed, and creates a lot of confusion in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   A few months after moving into an empty library in Cambridge,
Mass., the group had come up with a better way. Instead of making
the user type seemingly meaningless formulas like ``C1(EQ)A1-B1,''
and then having to replicate these formulas throughout the
spreadsheet, the group created a prototype that let the user type
meaningful formulas, like ``PROFIT(EQ)PRICE-COST.'' Many cells
could then be labeled as PROFIT, PRICE, or COST cells, and the
formula would automatically be applied to each one. Users might
create separate PROFIT, PRICE, and COST cells for each year that
they were analyzing. Or they might have one for each region of the
country. Or _ and this was the really radical idea _ they might
have different PROFIT, PRICE, and COST cells for different regions
and for different years, creating a three-dimensional spreadsheet.
The user might then add a fourth dimension, to investigate
different business scenarios, and a fifth dimension, to look at
different products.
</P>
<P>
   Salas took a demo of his ``Modeler'' program on tour to some of
Lotus's largest accounts in the spring of 1987 and got rave
reviews. In September 1988 the company committed to the project,
code-named ``Back Bay.'' The following month Steve Jobs visited the
company, and convinced Lotus Management to put Back Bay on Jobs's
new computer, a black magnesium machine called the Nextcube. The
product, which debuted in February 1991, was called Lotus Improv.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the story is better known. Jobs didn't do too
well with Next: he never sold more than 100,000 of the black
computers. So in 1992 Lotus ported Improv to Microsoft Windows 3.1.
But it didn't do too well there, either. According to Kate
Monaghan, a spokeswoman for Lotus, ``Improv won numerous awards as
an innovative spreadsheet tool but was discontinued in April 1996
due to low sales. Customers had a hard time deciding between 1-2-3
or Improv and so stuck with 1-2-3, the industry standard.'' Today
the standard is no longer 1-2-3: it's Microsoft Excel. While Excel
has a few of the features of Improv, it lacks the fundamental core.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't really think much about Excel's shortcomings until a
few months ago, when I started trying to build a series of
extremely complicated Excel spreadsheets. I was doing some
financial projections for a friend's company. I wanted to chart the
sales of several products over time, exploring different economic
and pricing scenarios. Then we wanted to look at different funding
scenarios. That's five dimensions right there. Excel has a feature
called ``pivot tables,'' but it only works with two dimensions. You
can also stack multiple Excel spreadsheets together to create a
third dimension. But after that, Excel is rather helpless.
</P>
<P>
   I am one of the few people who had a Next machine back in 1992,
and I got to be pretty skilled at using Improv. So after spinning
my wheels with Excel and buying more than $100 worth of books that
promised to solve my problems, but delivered far less, I started
hunting on the Internet. My Holy Grail was a 1993 copy of Lotus
Improv 2.0 for Windows 3.1. After a lot of searching I found
somebody who had an old copy, and I bought it for $75. I'm pleased
to report that the program runs like a champ under Windows '98. And
it's remarkably small: the entire program, including the help
files, the multimedia tutorial, and the example models, takes just
9 megabytes of space on my hard drive. I haven't given up on Excel,
but quite frankly I haven't found a need for it since switching.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, that's the end of the story. I'm legally
prohibited from making copies of Improv for my friends and
coworkers. Improv is protected by copyright, and even though Lotus
no longer sells or supports the product, that protection still
holds. In a very real way, this is a kind of crime against society.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of copyright under our legal tradition is to give
authors protection for their intellectual works, so that they will
be motivated to produce new ones. It is a bargain between society
and the inventor. If a company like Lotus reneges on its side of
the bargain _ and in the case of Improv, Lotus surely has _ I think
that the works that were protected by copyright should become
public property. That is, I think that they should go into the
public domain.
</P>
<P>
   The implications of this argument go far beyond Lotus and
Improv. In recent years dozens of software publishers have gone out
of business, and taken their wares with them. Just imagine what the
world would be like today, if instead of killing their products,
these companies had been forced to release their programs into the
public domain. Today there would be more than a dozen free word
processors and spreadsheets available for Windows, giving Microsoft
a real run for its money. And if the companies had been compelled
to release the source code for these products as well, then
enterprising hobbyists would have ported these applications to the
Linux operating system.
</P>
<P>
   One of the prime offenders in this world of dead software is
Apple, which has mothballed the Newton and all but given up on the
Nextstep operating systems. Ultimately, it would probably be in the
best interest of both Apple's shareholders and society as a whole
for companies like Lotus and Improv to release their failed
products to the public.
</P>
<P>
   There is a simple reason that they do not: if the public did a
better job with the software, then it would prove that these
products died because of mismanagement, and not because of the
competitive environment.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Well, it looks like those grizzled old on-line libertarians
were right. On the Internet, information really does want to be
free _ along with just about anything else that might entice
consumers to plug in.
</P>
<P>
   I figured the great Internet giveaway would be long over by now,
as companies would grow weary of pouring millions into on-line
businesses whose ``customers'' never coughed up a nickel. Not so.
The Web is turning all of us into high-tech moochers, eager to
satisfy our Internet desires on somebody else's dime.
</P>
<P>
   The latest evidence comes from Microsoft, which tends to give
away products only when it's getting beaten by a competitor. And
that's what Microsoft has just decided to do with its on-line
magazine Slate.
</P>
<P>
   You remember Slate. Founded in 1996 and edited by former New
Republic editor Michael Kinsley, it was one of the first attempts
to do serious journalism on the Web, with no less a firm than
Microsoft paying the freight. Slate had the eyeballs, the
mindshare, the buzz.
</P>
<P>
   And then, last year, Microsoft began charging for it. Now ask
yourself: When's the last time you heard people arguing about an
article in Slate?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, with its bare-knuckled attacks on conservative
critics of Bill Clinton, the free Internet publication Salon has
become the most controversial magazine on the Web, quoted by
newspapers and TV networks around the world. And all this attention
should soon translate into profits. Salon's marketing director
Patrick Hurley tells me that Salon expects to make money this year,
by selling ad space and reprint rights to its articles.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Microsoft's comic fumbling of its antitrust lawsuit, the
company isn't run by fools. If giving away Slate will get it in the
black, fine, they'll give it away. Now they just need to run some
mean-spirited, below-the-belt articles on Henry Hyde.
</P>
<P>
   Future readers of Slate may be doing their Web surfing on free
computers. When a California outfit called Free-PC.com announced it
would give away 10,000 of them earlier this month, 300,000 people
signed up.
</P>
<P>
   The idea's not nearly as daft as it sounds. With PC prices at
$500 and still falling, computers are well on their way to being
almost disposable, just like cell phones. Free-PC figures to make
its money the same as Salon, by pumping ads over the Internet and
constantly flashing them on the computer screens. If it makes money
on the first 10,000 users, it will keep giving machines away.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry watchers have ripped the idea, suggesting that
only low-income households will put up with a constant barrage of
Free-PC ads. ``By definition, these ads are reaching the wrong
people,'' industry expert Evan Schwartz told CNet News. Instead of
getting the sort of affluent geek who reads Wired magazine, Free-PC
might attract the kind of user who watches Jerry Springer.
</P>
<P>
   OK, but where's the downside in that? There are about 8 million
Springer fans, and they've got money to spend. Besides, I'd rather
have them surfing the Internet than roaming the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Even investors have developed an Internet freebie fetish. They
bid up the prices of Web stocks that specialize in giving away
information and punish companies that look for old-fashioned
income. Consider the strange case of Lycos Inc. The Waltham-based
Internet company saw its stock soar as long as it stayed in the
business of handing out free information, free e-mail, and free Web
pages. Then Lycos does a deal with the Home Shopping Network and
Ticketmaster that would have the company selling real stuff for
real money, and what happens? Meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   This one leaves me confused. Eventually these Internet firms
will have to make money. They can't all rely on advertising;
there's only so many banner ads to go around. And as Slate has
proven, people won't pay for information, opinion, attitude, when
others are giving them away.
</P>
<P>
   The big profits for Internet firms will come from selling
traditional products and services, as Lycos hopes to do. Web
companies that want to justify their monstrous stock prices are
bound to head this way. But they must still woo us to their sites,
which is why I figure the Internet's freebie bonanza has only just
begun.

_WEAPONS AGAINST BACTERIA WEAKEN

_MEDITERRANEAN DIET WINS AGAIN  
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Weapons against bacteria weaken
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, only four cases have been documented of resistance to
a last-ditch antibiotic in a common yet potentially deadly
bacteria. But already, the cases have set off public health alarms.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to better understand the emerging antibiotic
resistance of the bacterium staphylococcus aureus, researchers
detail three of the known cases in the current New England Journal
of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   One involved a 59-year-old Michigan man with diabetes and
chronic kidney failure, while another, a 66-year-old New Jersey man
with diabetes. The third was a 79-year-old New York man with
end-stage kidney disease.
</P>
<P>
   The staph infection in the three men's bodies showed signs of
resistance to what has long been considered the antibiotic of last
resort, vancomycin, according to the two research groups reporting
their findings.
</P>
<P>
   While a combination of antibiotics eventually eradicated the
infection in two of the patients, they died from other
complications. The third patient died the day after an antibiotic
combination was started in an attempt to fight off the infection.
</P>
<P>
   (The world's only other known case of vancomycin-resistant
staph, not detailed in the current journal, has been previously
described in Japan.)
</P>
<P>
   New antibiotics in the pipeline may help, writes Dr. Francis A.
Waldvogel of Switzerland in an accompanying editorial, but ``the
outlook is rather grim . . . since none of these agents have been
tested clinically on a sufficient scale.''
</P>
<P>
   What's needed instead, Waldvogel writes, is a ``major war
against the misuse of antibiotics.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A cancer-fighter with those fries? &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A tomato a day to keep cancer away?
</P>
<P>
   That's the implication of the most comprehensive review so far
of the scientific evidence for eating fresh and processed tomatoes
and reducing the risk of some cancers.
</P>
<P>
   The report, in the current Journal of the National Cancer
Institute, looked at 72 studies and found that 35 of them showed a
statistically significant lower cancer risk among people who ate
more fresh tomatoes and tomato-based products like sauce.
</P>
<P>
   The ingredient in tomatoes hypothesized to have the apparent
anti-cancer effect is lycopene, which gives the fruit its
characteristic red color. But more research needs to be done before
cause and effect can be established, said Dr. Edward Giovannucci, a
Harvard researcher who authored the review.
</P>
<P>
   Some tomato processing companies have already latched onto the
emerging evidence. H. J. Heinz Co. launched an ad campaign last
month, touting its ketchup as America's favorite source of
lycopene, to the dismay of Giovannucci and other researchers, who
say it's too early to say lycopene prevents cancer. They have not
received funding from Heinz.
</P>
<P>
   But Giovannucci and other researchers participated in a
telephone news conference sponsored by Campbell Soup Company
Wednesday, to highlight what was billed as the conclusion of a
``Harvard scientific review,'' that ``eating processed tomato
products may lower risk of cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Giovannucci said that he has not directly received funding from
Campbell Soup for his research, although he added that company
gifts have funded research assistants in his department. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Mediterranean diet wins again
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's a tasty way to possibly prevent a second heart attack:
The Mediterranean diet, featuring plenty of fruits, vegetables,
fish and beans, and the use of unsaturated fats like olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   In a study in the current Circulation: Journal of the American
Heart Association, involving more than 400 men and women who had a
first heart attack, those who followed a Mediterranean diet for
nearly four years had a 50 to 70 percent lower risk of a second
heart attack, compared with those prescribed a low-fat Western
diet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Results of the studies are not surprising as they rather
confirm previous. . .studies showing that the Mediterranean
population may be relatively protected from coronary heart disease
because of the foods they eat,'' said Dr. Michel de Lorgeril, who
headed the French study.

SOME NEW YORKERS DOUBT HILLARY CLINTON WILL RUN FOR SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES M. ODATO  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Although few political pundits will bet on
Hillary Rodham Clinton entering the U.S. Senate race in New York,
most think her nonresidency is a non-issue.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, history shows that Robert Kennedy, James Buckley and
others dodged the carpetbagger label to win or run well in New
York. Kennedy and Buckley preceded Daniel Patrick Moynihan in the
Senate seat that Moynihan plans to vacate in 2000 and which
Democrats hope Clinton would fill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state didn't give Lew Lehrman any trouble,'' said former
Gov. Mario Cuomo, who won his first term of office in 1982 after
taking 50.9 percent of the vote to Lehrman's 47.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   From Cuomo's point of view, Lehrman ranks among the opportunists
known as carpetbaggers _ those who seek office outside their home
territories. Their name arose when Northerners carrying belongings
in carpetbags ventured to the South after the Civil War for
financial gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never voted here, didn't live here, didn't pay taxes
here,'' Cuomo said. ``And he almost became governor.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehrman did arrive from Pennsylvania, but he owned a Manhattan
apartment and paid income taxes in New York prior to his
gubernatorial run.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Constitution says anyone who is at least 30 and who has
been a U.S. citizen for at least nine years can run for Senate. The
successful candidate must be a resident of the state by Election
Day.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, whose residences included Illinois and Arkansas before
Washington, D.C., shouldn't run into too much trouble in the Empire
State.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Sheinkopf, a New York City-based consultant for Democrats,
said she could raise the millions needed to run for Senate in New
York. He predicts that Republicans would have a strategic problem
going after her because any attack on the first lady would be an
attack on the president, whose popularity is high despite his
scandals and impeachment by the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you attack the president in New York State you're
committing political suicide, unless his popularity comes down,''
Sheinkopf said.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo pointed out that former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, and other
Republicans, showed reluctance to call for impeachment of the
president during last fall's campaign, indicating they did not want
to stir up voters.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's stature could score big points in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary Clinton can't be a carpetbagger because she's on
television in your living room every day,'' Sheinkopf said. ``That
makes her a New Yorker. Nobody belongs anyplace any more; we have a
celebrity culture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a non-issue,'' said Assembly Speaker Sheldon
Silver, a Democrat from Manhattan. ``Bobby Kennedy had the same
allegation ... When she comes to New York ... people would rally
around her candidacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy moved to New York in August 1964 to run against
Republican Sen. Kenneth Keating. That November he demolished
Keating at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Cunningham, an Albany banker who worked with Moynihan, said
the first lady would be better off staying out of the Senate race
because the job would be a step down and would eat at her ability
to raise money for her family and prevent her from campaigning for
other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think she will (run). She has a grand stage in
Washington and there are some major issues standing _ saving Social
Security and Medicare,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   John Zogby, of the Utica-based Zogby International polling firm,
said he would not be surprised if Clinton passes on the Moynihan
seat because there are many other opportunities for her.
</P>
<P>
   Although some polls show she could defeat New York City Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, a possible Republican nominee, Zogby found her
losing by six points in a December poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's a Giuliani/Clinton matchup, they're going to pull out
all the stops to attack this woman. They'll bring up Whitewater,
they'll bring up every single piece of scandal,'' said political
strategist Libby Post.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders are already rolling up their sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'd bring in a lot more baggage than the carpetbag,'' said
Terry O'Brien, spokesman for the New York Republican State
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's plans to wait until later this year to announce
her decision blocks other Democrats from starting campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York Democrats would be lucky to have her, but every day
she delays is another day another challenger loses,'' Sheinkopf
said. ``She needs to make the decision sooner rather than later.''

   AMMAN _ It's not so long ago that a well-known Israeli
politician _ now a declared enemy of the Oslo peace agreement _ was
publicly advocating the expulsion of Palestinians from their West
Bank and Jerusalem homes to an exile in Jordan. Jordan, he said,
would become Palestine.
</P>

   That man, Ariel Sharon, is now foreign minister of Israel.
</P>

   Microsoft is exploring the possibility of forming a strategic

<P>
   The alliance would strengthen Microsoft's grip on another

<P>
   Microsoft entered the UK cable TV sector on Jan. 25 when it
invested in NTL, Britain's third-largest cable TV company, and a
tie-up with Orange would be seen as another step down the same
road.

   BEIRUT _ The Kurds' most radical leader, Abdullah Ocalan _ whose

   The Kurdish PKK party, which organized the mass takeover of
Greek embassies around Europe Tuesday, is a hard outfit. No one
should be in any doubt about that. Nor should there be any doubt
about the party's leader, Abdullah Ocalan, whose rapid ejection
from the Greek embassy in Nairobi and extradition to Turkey has set
off this explosion of protest.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan is a terrorist with an appalling record of murder and
torture.
</P>
<P>
   But, like the IRA, the PKK is a mirror image of the forces that
have suppressed it. These are peoples for whom history has shown no

impeachment trial of Bill Clinton, and with it almost six months of
Congressional drama, it is surely time to recognize some of those
involved whose performances delighted and embarrassed us by turns

   With President Bill Clinton's impeachment acquittal Friday, the
world can breathe a sigh of relief and turn to more important
matters. Clinton has a world to lead and a place in history to
secure.
</P>
<P>
   And it is in foreign policy that he needs to work hardest in
order to make up for lost time. For, although the agonies and
distractions of the impeachment process have had surprisingly few
ill effects in domestic affairs, damage has been done to America's
moral authority abroad.

   Microsoft is exploring the possibility of forming a strategic

industry sources.

<P>
   The alliance would strengthen Microsoft's grip on another
platform of the converging computer, telecoms and broadcast
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft entered the UK cable TV sector on Jan. 25 when it
invested in NTL, Britain's third-largest cable TV company, and a
tie-up with Orange would be seen as another step down the same
road.

   ``It may or may not come off, but the Orange thing is part of a

   The Kurdish PKK party, which organized the mass takeover of
Greek embassies around Europe Tuesday, is a hard outfit. No one
should be in any doubt about that. Nor should there be any doubt
about the party's leader, Abdullah Ocalan, whose rapid ejection
from the Greek embassy in Nairobi and extradition to Turkey has set
off this explosion of protest.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan is a terrorist with an appalling record of murder and
torture.
</P>
<P>
   But, like the IRA, the PKK is a mirror image of the forces that
have suppressed it. These are peoples for whom history has shown no
remorse... &QL;

 &HT;    Art of translation calls for ear attuned to human emotion

   Southern fiction since Faulkner's time has been a peculiar
enthusiasm of the French. Early in her career, Kaye Gibbons had as
many French readers as American, and the translation of her first
novel, ``Ellen Foster,'' was a best seller in France. Told in the
voice of a young girl, the story situates a reader in a locale that
could only be the American South.
</P>
<P>
   In Faulkner's case, the irony is that he was one expatriate
American who went to Paris in the years between the two world wars,
found he didn't much like it and came home. The ground he tilled
was the postage stamp of Mississippi soil he called Yoknapatawpha.
The social backdrop of his novels _ a decaying Southern
aristocracy, an upstart clan from the hills, the complex relations
between blacks and whites _ might be familiar enough to literate
Europeans. But you wonder how that convoluted prose, an obstacle
even in English, must sound in French. You wonder what a French
reader makes of Faulkner even at his most straightforward. ``Light
in August'' begins:

   ``Sitting beside the road, watching the wagon mount the hill
toward her, Lena thinks, `I have come from Alabama: a fur piece.
All the way from Alabama a-walking. A fur piece.' ''
</P>
<P>
   I asked someone who has studied in France and is fluent in
French to render Faulkner's English into Francais. She read for a
moment and said, ``Translating it literally wouldn't be so much a
problem, but. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone can anticipate the problem: A literal translation would
not be Faulkner in French.
</P>
<P>
   `Not done with tracing paper'
</P>
<P>
   Translation is not a matter of searching out exact equivalents.
``A fur piece''? ``If I had to describe what I do,'' says Edith
Grossman, who has translated several of Gabriel Garcia Marquez's
works from Spanish into English, ``I would say that it's a matter
of ear and voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Marquez's Spanish, for example, can be as elaborate as
Faulkner's English, but Grossman ``made no effort to make his
language more concise.'' The translator who sets out to render
Marquez in English must ``hear that voice in Spanish and then try
to find the best way to convey the same emotional impact in
English.''
</P>
<P>
   The art is in adapting one language to another, knowing the
intonations and inflections of English well enough to reproduce the
sound and the sense of the Spanish. ``Translation is not done with
tracing paper,'' Grossman says. ``I think literal translation is a
great trap. Linguistic equivalence is not an emotive exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hardest with idioms and curses. When Grossman was
translating Marquez's ``Love in the Time of Cholera,'' she came
upon a word whose meaning in English was clear, but the sentence
itself couldn't be rendered literally. ``I played around with it
and finally made it `To hell with the archbishop,' '' she says.
When the book came out, she got a letter from a man in Mexico City
chiding her prudery. What she had translated as ``hell,'' he
advised her, was a certain scatological term familiar in every
language, including English.
</P>
<P>
   True enough, and yet the sound of the passage in Spanish had
escaped him. ``I could have translated it literally and it wouldn't
have sounded like Marquez,'' Grossman says. ``I think my obligation
is fidelity to the emotive effect on the reader.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bible lacking resonance
</P>
<P>
   Translations of great works are forever in dispute, as any
reader of the King James Bible knows. The Living Bible might be
contemporary English, but it is an English entirely without
resonance. It might as well be a commercial on radio.
</P>
<P>
   When the first English translation of ``Dr. Zhivago'' appeared
in England in 1958, Max Hayward and Manya Harari were hailed for
capturing Boris Pasternak's dense lyricism _ and this under the
pressure of deadline induced by the Cold War. Soon after, an
Americanized version appeared, and Edmund Wilson _ who had taken it
upon himself to learn Russian so that he might read the
19th-century masters in the original _ wrote a review in The New
Yorker that nailed Hayward and Harari on several points. (In a
letter, Wilson smugly wrote that Hayward himself was embarrassed by
it: ``I was right in thinking they had not had time to do it
properly.'')
</P>
<P>
   The errors might have been real, and yet the sweep and feel of
events _ the Russian Revolution, the religious symbolism, the
conflict between civilizing impulses and the madness of Bolshevism
_ somehow survived intact. Edmund Wilson pronounced the French
translation best. But surely the point was how well tragedy in one
language could be experienced in another, and with something close
to high fidelity.

 &HT;    `Why Not Me?' posits Franken as a gonzo candidate for prez
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, Feb. 21.
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the current political climate, it's become almost impossible
to write satire that outstrips reality. Political gadfly Al Franken
has wisely pretty much ignored the current Washington shenanigans
in his latest book of political humor, going straight for
unvarnished fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   Franken, of course, is the former ``Saturday Night Live'' star
who invented the ``Al Franken Decade'' back in the '70s and then
went on to write the sucker-punching No. 1 best seller ``Rush
Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot and Other Observations'' and to create
and star in the NBC sitcom ``Lateline.''
</P>
<P>
   His latest writing effort is the improbable story of how he runs
for president in 2000, gets elected and lasts a mere 144 days in
office before resigning due to a total personal meltdown. It's told
in a pastiche style that includes fake news articles, his campaign
diary, transcripts of CNN interviews and the definitive Bob
Woodward behind-the-scenes chronicle, which skewers the
journalist's omniscient style mercilessly.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are plenty of pointy elbows thrown at other real
people _ Al Gore, Clarence Thomas, David Brinkley, adviser Dick
Morris, think-tank wonk Norman Ornstein, CNN's Jeff Greenfield (a
friend of Franken's) _ it is Franken himself, or the fictionalized
facsimile, who gets it the worst.
</P>
<P>
   The real Franken is a pretty smart guy, but the book's Franken
is a total dolt. His single issue is reducing ATM fees, and his
foot is never far from his mouth. He keeps a campaign diary in
which he calls New Hampshire residents ``inbred retards'' and
``feebleminded mouth breathers'' (the diary becomes public, of
course) and tells a sick but funny joke about the assassination of
John F. Kennedy _ to the Knights of Columbus. Blissfully unaware
that his presidential bid has been hijacked by big-money interests,
Franken is interested mainly in bedding hookers, napping and
whining, while his campaign is run by users and losers.
</P>
<P>
   Franken is gleefully aggressive in trashing the tenets of
political correctness, from his inaugural speech, in which he
apologizes for slavery by quoting, in dialect, from the movie
``Mandingo,'' to his insistence on having an all-Jewish cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why Not Me?'' bogs down at some points (just like a real
presidency!) but offers up a delightfully wicked take on our
political process.
</P>

   Why Not Me? The Inside Story of the Making and Unmaking of the
Franken Presidency. By Al Franken. Delacorte. $23.95. 289 pages.

WRENCHING `AFFLICTION' DONE IN BY CLUMSY ENDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The film adaptation of Russell Banks' dreary, wintry novel
``Affliction'' is probably going to be an acquired taste, with men
liking it better than women.
</P>
<P>
   Its a guy's rite of passage film, written and directed by Paul
Schrader, who is good at making movies that appeal to the masculine
sense of ritual and isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Nolte plays Wade Whitehouse, a puppet sheriff in a corrupt
town. Wade drinks too much and is prone to violent outbursts. His
anger has alienated him from his first wife, Lillian (Mary Beth
Hurt), and his daughter Jill (Brigid Tierney). Wade dates Margie
Fogg (Sissy Spacek), a waitress at the local diner. It's a place _
and life _ that has no future and rarely changes over time.
</P>
<P>
   Wade's brother Rolfe (Willen Dafoe) left town years before for
the big city and he's become a respected professor, loathe to
return to his economically depressed Lawford, N.H., home. Wade
calls him almost nightly to voice his troubles and Rolfe listens,
knowing his big brother will never change either.
</P>
<P>
   But Wade is smart enough to smell trouble and after his friend,
Jack Hewitt (Jim True), guides a union boss on a hunting trip and
the man is found accidentally shot to death. Wade begins to take
his duties as sheriff seriously and, when he unravels a plan that
could devastate the already decrepit town, the high-up resistance
to his discovery leads to darker, scarier waters.
</P>
<P>
   Schrader is attracted to lost men who stumble and bumble about
in their own lives. ``Affliction'' features a fine, gravelly
performance by Nolte, an actor who generally wears his technique on
his sleeve. Here he fills a character fumbling through middle age
and wreaking havoc on those around him. His performance earned him
a best actor Oscar nomination.
</P>
<P>
   James Coburn co-stars as Wade's father, a similarly alcoholic
abuser who terrified his children and wife, and refuses to grow up
or take responsibility for his actions.
</P>
<P>
   Wade swears he was ``never afflicted by that man's violence,''
but Banks' novel _ and Schrader's script _ present a different
story, the sad saga of a man destined to live in the footsteps of
his father because he cannot control his own temper or emotions.
</P>
<P>
   The film struggles structurally with its parallel stories of
family and of greed and power, with Schrader using the device of
Dafoe reading from Banks' book as prelude and epitaph to the film.
The ending undercuts everything that has come before. After
journeying with these characters, we want more than simple still
photographs and prose that clumsily gives closure to a wrenching,
harrowing tale.
</P>
<P>
   Affliction. Directed and written by Paul Schrader. Cast: Nick
Nolte, Sissy Spacek, James Coburn, Jim True, Willem Dafoe. Lions
Gate Films. 114 minutes. Rated R for language, violence.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-

FRENETIC `24 HOUR WOMAN' IS AN ENGAGING PUZZLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Director Nancy Savoca has always made challenging movies that
instill real dimension, conflict and integrity into her
idiosyncratic female protagonists.
</P>
<P>
   They chafe against Hollywood's mainstream female sterotype of
the sexy woman who supports her superhero man because they're
smart, earthy and in touch with reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``True Love,'' ``Dogfight'' and ``Household Saints'' featured
strong women struggling against the tide _ to an often unorthodox
result. ``The 24 Hour Woman'' is kin to those films in that it's
just as provocative _ if, sadly, less successful.
</P>
<P>
   The movie stars that acquired taste of an actress, Rosie Perez,
as Grace Santos, producer of a New York-based early morning TV show
geared to women called ``The 24 Hour Woman.'' Grace's husband,
Eddie (Diego Serrano), co-hosts the show with Margo Lynn (Karen
Duffy), an energetic ball of fire who one day surprises the world
(and Eddie and Grace) by casually announcing on air that the couple
is expecting a child.
</P>
<P>
   They deal with the event by becoming media celebrities _ which
eventually strains their once happy marriage. Eddie wants to be in
movies and he takes off more frequently for auditions in L.A., and
Grace can't decide whether she wants to stay at home or be producer
of the show, which has just been picked up by a major network.
</P>
<P>
   This dilemma is played against that of Madeline Labelle
(Marianne Jean-Baptiste), a mother of three with an unemployed
husband who dropped out of the TV rat race six years earlier to
raise the kids and now needs a job. She's hired by Grace as her
low-paid assistant because Madeline can calmly manage the chaos of
a 24-hour-a-day job.
</P>
<P>
   Perez is terrific as Grace but Marianne Jean-Baptiste, so
quietly honest in Mike Leigh's ``Secrets and Lies,'' comes off as a
tepid plot point that doesn't fit into the rest of the film's
energy and pace.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Savoca packs so much into ``The 24 Hour Woman''
that the viewer doesn't know where to focus. It's a frenetic,
chaotic, interesting mess of a movie that engages as much as it
puzzles.
</P>
<P>
   And Savoca and co-writer Richard Guay ultimately sell out a good
cast _ especially Perez _ and an interesting story by pandering to
a lower denominator focused on daytime TV and its sorry, cheap
theatrics.
</P>
<P>
   The 24 Hour Woman. Directed by Nancy Savoca. Written by Richard
Guay, Nancy Savoca. Cast: Rosie Perez, Marianne Jean-Baptiste,
Patti LuPone, Diego Serrano. The Shooting Gallery. 95 minutes.
Rated R for language, mild violence, sexual themes.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+

   PARIS _ If you listened to the album ``From There to Here''
(Columbia) not knowing what it was, you'd be surprised to learn
that the bass player was the leader and that he was Clint
Eastwood's son.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kyle Eastwood says the name has disadvantages as well
as advantages, the fact remains that it's not a bad name at all.
What he means is it balances out _ good luck and good genes on one
hand, questionable authenticity on the other.
</P>
<P>
   Without the name it would have been a lot more difficult for him
to reach, let alone persuade, such musicians as Billy Childs, Oscar
Brashear, Plas Johnson (the saxophonist who played the ``Pink
Panther'' theme), the percussionist Peter Erskine (Weather Report)
and Joni Mitchell (singing Marvin Gaye's ``Trouble Man'') to record
on his debut album.
</P>
<P>
   Remember though: Name or no name, people of such reputation and
caliber would not lend their own names to a faulty project.
</P>
<P>
   Playing the contrabass is far from the easiest way to capitalize
on the name of a nabob film-star father. As a child, Kyle played a
role in his father's movie, ``Honkytonk Man,'' and it would have
been easier and more lucrative to follow that career than learning
how to play the jazz bass.
</P>
<P>
   It's a high-risk job, a lot of responsibility and potential
grief _ there's a special circle in hell reserved for bad bass
players.
</P>
<P>
   If you are ambitious for fame or fortune, the odds are against
you. People go to the restroom during a bass solo. But there's a
lot of pride involved.
</P>
<P>
   Bass players are aware, even if the average listener is not,
that they have the real power and that the musicians know it. They
play the only truly essential instrument in the band. Without a
sturdy bass line, the center will not hold.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood is confident enough to lay back on his first record
under his name. True to the nature of his function, he has been
careful not to put himself in front of the other players. There is
a modest number of bass solos, and his walking is not
ostentatiously mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Presentation is varied _ standards, originals, instrumentals,
vocals (by Julia Fordham and Diana King as well as Mitchell), a
combo, and the big band version of Tom Waits's ``I Beg Your
Pardon,'' featuring Mark Isham and David Sanchez, sounds like a Gil
Evans/Miles Davis collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   The casting is intelligent, the style consistent, the pattern
obviously cut from one piece of cloth. It's more than a merely
respectable first record.
</P>
<P>
   He feels no pressure to prove anything to anyone. He speaks
slowly, shyly, convincingly: ``If I let it bother me every time
people asked me about my dad then I'd be bothered a lot. He's
always been my dad, always will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can do is do the best I can and people either accept it
or they don't. If they don't, there's not much I can do about
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jazz was always in the house. He and his parents listened to
Charlie Parker records together. When his father was producing a
jazz documentary called ``Straight No Chaser,'' they sat around for
hours watching a stack of Thelonious Monk videotapes. Quality
time. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The bass caught his ear early on. He found that he was usually
paying attention to the lower register. One thing he likes about
the bass is that its role is essential for both rhythm and harmony.
</P>
<P>
   He started on the electric bass-guitar in Pebble Beach High
School, near Carmel, Calif., of which his father was the mayor for
a while. Once he learned basic tuning, scales and chords it became
fairly easy for him.
</P>
<P>
   He learned R&AMP;B, Motown and reggae tunes by ear. He had friends
who played jazz and they were always looking for a bass player.
Everybody needs a bass player. They'd ask him if he knew this or
that standard. If not, he figured it out quickly. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Growing up with Clint Eastwood, you meet interesting people. The
young Kyle met the legendary Ray Brown, Ron Carter and Lennie
Niehaus, who wrote the score for his father's movie ``Bird.''
</P>
<P>
   When he switched to the contrabass, he began to practice all day
long. It is both a mentally and physically difficult instrument.
Whole days would go by and he wouldn't leave the house. He
practiced bowing, improved his intonation, learned the repertoire,
got more comfortable with improvising.
</P>
<P>
   His father likes to play Fats Waller tunes and boogie woogie on
the piano. He has a good left hand and he showed his son how it
worked. Maybe that had something to do with Kyle's original choice
of instrument _ with paying attention to the bottom in the first
place. They still jam together. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 200 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 825) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Starting off his career, Kyle moved down to Los Angeles for
eight years. He got the opportunity to play with Jack Sheldon,
Mundell Lowe, Teddy Edwards and Clark Terry. But time began to be
on his hands there, and he moved to New York City.
</P>
<P>
   He says he likes the ``craziness'' in New York. There was more
of an opportunity to play there and ``along with my family, playing
music is the only thing that is important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   He lives in TriBeCa with his wife, the Spanish actress Laura
Gomez, and their 5-year-old daughter, Graylen.
</P>
<P>
   Since the album was released last autumn, his quintet has worked
fairly steadily. Leading a working band means that the music has
the opportunity to evolve. It has come together in only a few
months.
</P>
<P>
   A month-long European tour in April will include France,
Britain, the Netherlands, Austria, Spain and the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   It's his band: He hires the guys, directs the rehearsals, picks
the tunes, accepts the gigs. All in all, he says with a grin, it's
a ``fairly democratic'' group. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As far as the future is concerned, he is sure of one thing _ he
wants to continue making music one way or another. Along the line,
he'd like to learn arranging.
</P>
<P>
   He feels at home being part of the expanded family of musicians.
``The musicians have been pretty accepting. When they first hear
the last name they get a weird look sometimes. Once they hear me
play, though, it's usually O.K.'' &QL;

`JAWBREAKER' IS A PATHETIC, SLOPPY DUD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A nifty soundtrack and a stylish visual eye don't compensate for
unoriginality, incomplete storylines and a silly premise in this
sorry ``girl version'' echo of last year's ``Very Bad Things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jawbreakers'' is Darren Stein's wish fulfillment fantasy about
sexually provocative high school girls who accidentally kill one of
their own and then must cover up the terrible deed by letting the
class nerd into the clique. It has little resonance or credibility,
and will have viewers wondering just what the heck Hollywood is
trying to tell kids these days.
</P>
<P>
   The trend to equally sexualize and make high school girls evil
bumped into high gear with ``Heathers'' and has morphed during the
decade since its cult ascendance into movies like ``The Craft.''
But at least ``The Craft'' didn't turn its subjects into
jiggly-breasted Penthouse centerfolds.
</P>
<P>
   Stein might hope to get a date through this pathetic exploration
of high school politics and proms, but he still has a lot to learn
about women.
</P>
<P>
   He also fails to stay on course with his pale story and terrible
plotting. The film falls apart several times over and then totally
bombs in its weak senior prom finale, a pallid ripoff of Brian
DePalma's ``Carrie.'' Stein hasn't an original thought or voice,
and his hip whitewash doesn't disguise a real sense of loathing for
that which he purports to admire.
</P>
<P>
   Jawbreakers. Directed and written by Darren Stein. Cast: Rose
McGowan, Rebecca Gayheart, Pam Grier, Julie Benz, Judy Evans Greer.
TriStar Pictures. 90 minutes. Rated R for violence, sexual content,
language.

 BC- GETAWAY19-COX &HT;    Jack Daniel's distillery part of village culture
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LYNCHBURG, Tenn. _ Jack Daniel is more than the name of a man
and a whiskey. It's a culture. And the 361 people in this village,
many of them workers at the Daniel distillery, are bound and
determined to perpetuate the image.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors from the snowy North may have never heard such
``aw-shucks'' folksiness as that of potbellied guide Morgan
Steelman. Jack Daniel's mesh cap atop his balding head, Steelman
dishes out on a tour of one of the best-smelling manufacturing
plants this side of the Mississippi River.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's oldest registered distillery (started in 1866),
where Steelman estimates about 32,000 gallons of Tennessee sipping
whiskey are turned out each day, draws around 250,000 visitors a
year for tours that last about 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But it is only one of several spirit-filled stops in southern
Tennessee, including the George Dickel plant, a smaller distillery
in the larger town of Tullahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Several wineries have also been established in the vicinity
since 1977, when, for the first time since Prohibition, state laws
changed to allow establishment of farm wineries. Monteagle Wine
Cellars in Monteagle, for example, has a tasting room likely to be
hosted by a John Deere cap-clad pourer and a glass window
overlooking the winemaking in the basement.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers who grow impatient on I-75 can also visit the tasting
room at the Georgia Winery, just off the interstate at Chickamauga
on the way. (Here, salesclerks say, they separate the Yankees from
the Southerners by the way they prounounce ``muscadine.'')
</P>
<P>
   At the Daniel distillery, Steelman advises visitors to ``walk
slow and breathe deep. You might come out feelin' better,'' as he
leads them off a shuttle bus into a warehouse where barrels of
whiskey are stacked seven stories high. The distillery has 48
warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're far apart in case of fire,'' he explains, pronouncing
the words that mean distance and flames the same way. The barrels,
Steelman says, are made in Kentucky, used once, and cost $87
apiece.
</P>
<P>
   As he walks through the walls of whiskey, Steelman mingles
production figures with bits of the myth, legend and facts about
Jack Daniel, the man and the business.
</P>
<P>
   One learns that:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Jack Daniel, the 10th child of his father, ran away from home
to live with a neighbor at 6, moved in with a lay Lutheran pastor a
few years later and bought a still from the preacher at age 16
after a traveling evangelist convinced the church its leaders ought
not to be making whiskey.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Daniel was only 5 feet 2 inches and wore a size 4 shoe, but a
white marble statue of him that guards the famous limestone spring
on the distillery premises has feet a size larger. Otherwise, the
statue would topple from top-heaviness.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The distinctive square bottle that holds the whiskey was
preferred by Daniel because it stood apart from the round bottles
used by other distillers. It is preferred by Steelman because ``it
don't roll off the car seat.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Jack Daniel, the man, died in 1911, six years after he kicked
a safe in his little distillery in frustration when it wouldn't
open. The resulting gangrene cost him a leg and, eventually, his
life. The distillery was taken over by the bachelor Daniel's
nephew, Lem Motlow, who saw that the company survived
``Pro'bition,'' and then by Motlow's sons before being sold out of
the family.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  One of the greatest insults to Jack Daniel's, the whiskey, is
to refer to it as ``bourbon,'' that drink from Tennessee's northern
neighbor. The difference is that Tennessee whiskey is filtered
through charcoal made from burning local maple. (The company now
also sells the charcoal briquets.)
</P>
<P>
   The distinction was recognized by the U.S. government in 1944,
when it proclaimed that the whiskey had ``characteristics
unbeknownst to a bourbon or a rye.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors can no longer tour the Jack Daniel's bottling
operation, Steelman says, because government regulations require
that anyone in the vicinity remove all jewelry and wear hairnets
and earplugs. ``Don't know what we ever done without 'em,'' he
remarks sarcastically about the rules. Instead, guests are invited
to sit in high-backed wooden rocking chairs and watch a video whose
narrator is every bit the old mountain boy Steelman is.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you see up here is what we are,'' says Roger Brashears,
spokesman for the distillery. ``Marketing gurus and MBAs and
everybody else has wanted us to get them fade-in-and-out
projectors. I'm the old fogey that says this is the way we've
always done it.''
</P>
<P>
   Brashears claims he came to work at the distillery 35 years ago
``right after they invented dirt and before they invented soap.''
If the sound on the presentation doesn't always match the picture,
that's just the way it is, he says.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the tour, visitors are invited up to the bar for a
free slug of _ believe it or not _ lemonade. There are no free
samples here. But bottles are available in a gift shop. Downtown in
the village of Lynchburg, more souvenirs are for sale in shops
around the square.
</P>
<P>
   For those who choose to make a purchase at the distillery, guide
Steelman has a word of advice he says came down from his daddy, who
sent him to buy moonshine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't drive and drank,'' he says. ``You might spill it.''
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: From Atlanta take I-75 north. The tasting room
for Georgia Wines Inc., is about 80 miles from Atlanta at Exit 141
in Chickamauga. Take a left off the exit; the winery is about 300
yards past the bridge on the right. From I-75 north, take I-24 west
through Chattanooga. Monteagle Wine Cellars is on U.S. 41A at the
Sewanee-Monteagle exit. Take a left off the exit. Winery is on the
right, less than a mile away. To get to Tullahoma and the George A.
Dickel &AMP; Co. Distillery, follow I-24 to Exit 111 at Manchester.
Take Tenn. 55 south to Tullahoma. Farther south off Tenn. 55 is
Lynchburg and the Jack Daniel Distillery. Or, from Monteagle, take
U.S. 41A northwest to Tenn. 55 and into Lynchburg.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Staying over: Besides the usual chain motels, the Monteagle
area offers several distinctive choices. Perhaps the most elegant
is the Adams Edgeworth Inn, a 14-room bed-and-breakfast, which also
offers dinner for an additional charge. The Victorian residence is
on the National Historic Register. Rates range from $95 to $175,
with most rooms in the $125-$145 range. 931-924-4000. Nearby is the
smaller North Gate Inn, with only seven rooms ranging from $80 to
$110. Dinner is available on weekends in the winter. 931-924-2799.
Both Adams Edgeworth and North Gate are on the grounds of the
Monteagle Assembly, a turn-of-the-century community of summer homes
developed by families who gathered there for educational, artistic
and religious enrichment.
</P>
<P>
   For a very different atmosphere, consider Jim Oliver's Smoke
House Lodge, which offers 96 motel rooms and 14 cabins with a
restaurant on the premises. Rooms are $59.95 Mondays through
Thursdays, $69.95 on weekends; one-bedroom cabins are $110 Mondays
through Thursdays, $141 weekends.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Dining: For a fine restaurant, Pearl's sits in a most unlikely
place, beside U.S. 41A between Monteagle and nearby Sewanee, home
of the University of the South. The restaurant is open for dinner
beginning at 5 p.m. Tuesdays through Sundays. Among the highlights
are fish specialities in the $15-$20 range. Reservations are
usually required. 931-598-9568. Beer is available. Wine may be
brought in. For soup and sandwiches in an interesting setting, try
Shenanigans in the village of Sewanee. A popular hangout for
University of the South students, the cafe is decorated with local
artwork and pottery. A gallery is in the back.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Information: Georgia Wines, open 11 a.m.-6 p.m.
Mondays-Saturdays, 706-937-2177; Monteagle Wine Cellars, open 8
a.m.-5 p.m. Mondays-Saturdays, noon-5 p.m. Sundays, 1-800-556-9463;
George A. Dickel &AMP; Co. Distillery, open 9 a.m.-3 p.m. Mondays
through Fridays, 931-857-3124; and Jack Daniel Distillery, open 8
a.m.-4 p.m. daily, 931-759-6180. All tours and tastings are free.

 &HT;    Island courses may be tough, but they're easy on the eyes
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, Feb. 21.
 &HT;    By Jeffry Scott
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KITTY HAWK, N.C. _ Golf is a sport, like baseball, so impossibly
tedious to people who don't play, or enjoy watching it, that it
gets elevated by those who do into a kind of near-mystical
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Something that transcends life, yet somehow reflects it.
</P>
<P>
   What then to make of my first three shots off the first tee at
Sea Scape Golf Links?
</P>
<P>
   One shot rattled off the roof of a condominium along the right
side of the fairway. The second landed in the condominium parking
lot. The third bounced off what appeared to be, from the tee box, a
Ford Taurus.
</P>
<P>
   Was the first shot my first marriage? The second my retirement
plan? The third my last girlfriend, who left me for a guy who
delivers pizza?
</P>
<P>
   I had come expecting pain. Life is pain. Golf is pain.
</P>
<P>
   But did the three major tragedies of my recent adult life have
to get played out on the first hole, out of the first tee box, with
three $3 Titleists?
</P>
<P>
   The Outer Banks of North Carolina is like that for golfers.
</P>
<P>
   The barrier island's eight courses _ four of which I played in a
three-day bout of duffer's delirium _ is the best test of a
golfer's woods, irons and mettle this side of Scotland's Auld Sod.
</P>
<P>
   It's a place where 20 and 30 handicappers go from misery to
martyrdom. The lowly golfer is lifted to glorious demise by
conditions that can easily _ and heroically _ be blamed on the
gods.
</P>
<P>
   Some courses are tougher than others. Yet all are beleaguered by
the same British Open-like conditions of wind and rain. And most
are designed in the links style, with remorselessly unforgiving
rough and bumpy fairways that can kick well-placed shots into
bunkers and bad lies.
</P>
<P>
   By reputation, the Outer Banks is one of America's most
beautiful and last unspoiled littorals. In the last five years, it
also has turned into a golf boomtown.
</P>
<P>
   The area around Kitty Hawk, Kill Devil Hills and Nags Head is
chockablock with condos, beach houses, hotels, fast food joints,
tourist spots and strip malls.
</P>
<P>
   During the morning and afternoon rush hour, in high season,
traffic slows to a crawl along the island's main drag, N.C. 158. No
sooner do you curse the congestion, however, than you realize that
less than 10 miles away lie beaches unspoiled since English
settlers arrived in the late 1500s.
</P>
<P>
   South of Nags Head, at Pea Island National Wildlife Refuge on
Hatteras Island, miles of shoreline are littered only by shells,
trundled only by crabs and the scurrying of seabirds, bordered by
majestic dunes, and disturbed only by the salutary song of sea
breezes rustling sea grass.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make you forget golf.
</P>
<P>
   And remember that you brought along friends and family and
maybe, just maybe, there's more to life than making a nasty, 4-foot
sidehill putt _ to break 100.
</P>
<P>
   Nurse that thought, with a brew, between rounds, lolling on the
beach.
</P>
<P>
   Rise early and watch the morning sun burn the fog off the
Atlantic. Hear the crash of roiling waves that make for some of the
best surfing on the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Stop and smell the salt air.
</P>
<P>
   The Outer Banks can be the best of both worlds for the golfer
who questions his very existence after every shanked shot.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a roundup of four courses where shanking is always in
season:
</P>
<P>
   Sea Scape Golf Links
</P>
<P>
   My first course was a beer.
</P>
<P>
   I had it in the clubhouse bar at Sea Scape, the Outer Banks'
first golf course, built in 1968 and designed by Masters champion
Art Wall, and recently redesigned by Jack Nicklaus Jr.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to get a feel for the place, the island, my fate.
</P>
<P>
   I asked one of the sunburned regulars, who was sipping a Miller
Lite and watching the Clinton-Lewinsky soap opera on CNN, how often
he played the club.
</P>
<P>
   He waved at a buddy sitting down at the other end of the bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to have a regular tee time at 4 p.m.,'' he said. ``But
it's getting too crowded. Now, I usually just come here to drink.''
</P>
<P>
   With that bit of wisdom, I went to the first hole, a par-4, and
carded a 9.
</P>
<P>
   It was early October (golf season is from March through October,
though it's the South, and spring is apt to show up any Tuesday),
and conditions were doggedly immaculate. Sunny, just a whiff or
breeze, and the temperature in the low 70s.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing to blame for that Baghdad treatment of the condo. Except
my swing, a long loopy affair that has earned me two nicknames:
Sluggo and Corkscrew.
</P>
<P>
   It's the reason we have chiropractic clinics.
</P>
<P>
   I started on the 10th hole (the first tee was backed up), and
quickly became acquainted with what's meant by ``links style''
layout.
</P>
<P>
   It means if you don't hit your drive down the middle and land in
the rough you'll be unlucky if you find the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Likely, the grass, or sand, or bush you've landed in will cost
you a stroke. There's little point in trying to advance the ball.
Just chip out. Hit your next shot toward the green, and pray for
bogey.
</P>
<P>
   A drive down the middle is no guarantee of prosperity, either.
Over the course of the course, several of my fairway shots hit
mounds and bounced into the rough.
</P>
<P>
   By links course standards, most of Sea Scapes fairways are
graciously wide (not that it mattered this day: I hit only 6 of
18). And the course's bent grass greens putted true and not too
fast.
</P>
<P>
   The longest hole was No. 1, a Par 5, 592 yards from the back
tees, and straight. But bunkers bedeviled the landing areas for the
drive and approach shots.
</P>
<P>
   I managed a bogey with a 1-putt.
</P>
<P>
   The course winds through the dunes and maritime forest with no
parallel fairways. From the 15th and 18th holes, the ocean is
visible.
</P>
<P>
   The hole I enjoyed most was No. 13, a 130-yard Par 3, from a
steeply elevated tee. A huge sandtrap fronts the green. I choked up
on a wedge and landed on the front edge and two-putted for a par.
</P>
<P>
   Lasting impression: A decent, forgiving course on a calm day.
(In the wind, add 5 strokes to my score of 98.)
</P>
<P>
   Nags Head Golf Links
</P>
<P>
   Wake up and smell the sea breeze. It's gusting 20 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   There was little news value in the starter telling me this at 8
a.m. on the first tee at Nags Head: ``You don't need your driver
much because it's a short course. But you will need to be
accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   I played with a threesome of fellows from Philadelphia who
insisted I join them in a side bet, a game called ``Wolf,'' which I
still don't understand, but it only cost me $7.
</P>
<P>
   This was my favorite course.
</P>
<P>
   More posh than Seascape, and immaculately groomed, Nags Head
starts on the beach side of the island and winds around to the east
side. Four holes skirt Currituck Sound.
</P>
<P>
   Dunes intrude on play everywhere, as do birds, wildflowers,
bottlenecked fairways, nasty doglegs and the overpowering urge to
pull out the driver.
</P>
<P>
   My advice: Hmmm. Ask me after it lands.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite hole: No. 5, a Par 5, bordered on the left by the
sound. There were three reasons to love it.
</P>
<P>
   The view of the sound was spectacular, egrets soaring overhead,
sailboats on the water. The hole is reachable in two (the drive
over a bog; the second shot over a pond).
</P>
<P>
   And I parred it, landing short in two, chipping on and
two-putting.
</P>
<P>
   Toughest hole: No. 18, a 583-yard Par 5 from an elevated tee.
The second shot is through a narrow chute between dunes on the
left, trees on the right. Currituck Sound laps the right side of
the hole. I shot 8, and lost a ball.
</P>
<P>
   Second toughest hole: No 12. Uphill, 431 yard Par 4, over a pond
on the second shot to an elevated, bunkered green, which I'm still
trying to reach.
</P>
<P>
   Lasting impression: Nags Head is the Outer Banks' foremost
course. This is a good walk unspoiled, no matter what you shoot.
</P>
<P>
   The Currituck Club
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the club.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four courses I played, Currituck was the only one where I
felt like they'd kick me off if somebody checked my credit
references.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Golf Magazine voted Currituck _ which opened in 1996 as
the sister club to Nags Head _ as one of America's Top 10 New
Courses.
</P>
<P>
   The starter, a brisk man, informed me that I was lucky it wasn't
March or the conditions would be ``just like the British Open.
Wind, rain, and cold.''
</P>
<P>
   The course is, like Nags Head, immaculately groomed and staked
off for distances.
</P>
<P>
   The layout winds through the maritime forest, past swamps and
between dunes, with many elevated tees and stunning holes.
</P>
<P>
   The fairways offer more predicable bounces than Nags Head or
Seascape. The rough is evil as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Toughest and favorite hole: No. 7, 502-yard Par 5, with
Currituck Sound on the left. Lined by live oaks, with a huge
landing area, the hole begs for you to swing as hard as you can and
easily reach it in two. So I tried it _ and reached it in four, and
three-putted.
</P>
<P>
   Second favorite hole: No. 15, a gorgeous, 174-yard Par 3 that is
so primordially beautiful (with a pond, and the maritime forest and
swamp bordering it) it feels like your hitting into the Triassic
age.
</P>
<P>
   Lingering impression: A posh, beautiful course, a bit too
country clubby to feel like, even under the worst conditions, it's
as bad as it ought to be.
</P>
<P>
   The Pointe Golf Club
</P>
<P>
   Opened in 1995 at the site of what used to be a sod farm, The
Pointe is uncommonly flat, but makes up for it with devilishly fast
greens.
</P>
<P>
   The day I played it rained. Still, The Pointe was my second
favorite course.
</P>
<P>
   It's the most forgiving of the four I played, with parallel
fairways, no sand dunes, rough easy to hit from and negligible
wind.
</P>
<P>
   Water comes into play on 12 holes. And the slick greens, for me,
made three putts routine.
</P>
<P>
   Favorite hole: No. 12, Par 4, where the tee box is back in a
swamp and you hit 170 yards to clear the hazard, bordered tightly
on each side by cypress. Then hit to a heavily bunkered green.
</P>
<P>
   Toughest hole: No. 8, 459-yard, Par 5, dogleg right. Easy to
reach in two if you cut the corner right with a drive. But just try
to sink a putt on the three-tiered green. I chipped on in three and
carded a 6, three-putting from 7 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Lingering impression: Not a characteristic Outer Banks course,
but a good place to get in the first round of your trip as a
warm-up.
</P>
<P>
   Postscript
</P>
<P>
   Golf is supposed to be a game of leisure. I wouldn't recommend
playing more than one round a day on the Outer Banks.
</P>
<P>
   I played Nags Head and Currituck the same day, and managed to
squeeze in all 36 holes, but it began feel less like a vacation
than it did survivalism.
</P>
<P>
   The wind, sun, and all that whacking balls out of the rough and
going into the wallet to buy more has a draining effect.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four rounds, I broke 100 three times. My best score was
at The Pointe, a 92. My average score was 98. I had figured about
right. The elements could be blamed for an average of six strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner and a drink beckoned.
</P>
<P>
   I drove up to Duck, a little town north of Kitty Hawk on N.C.
12. It's like Buckhead, with a splash. Art galleries, boutiques,
restaurants and bars.
</P>
<P>
   I sat on the dock, had a beer, and contemplated the day. I gazed
over a water hazard I wouldn't have to hit across, Currituck Sound,
and watched the sun plunge into it.
</P>
<P>
   I tried not to think of it as a metaphor.

MUCH-HYPED INTEL CHIP FACES PERFORMANCE QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Craig Barrett, the tanned, rock-jawed chief
executive of computer chip-making giant Intel Corp., confessed
something Silicon Valley executives rarely utter out loud: Many
computer users probably really don't need to buy the company's
latest product.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, if you're doing regular, text-based business applications,
you really don't need the Pentium III,'' Barrett said Wednesday as
he paused between kiosks at the company's Pentium III kickoff event
at the San Jose Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, how fast can someone type?'' Barrett said, then
quickly changed his tune.
</P>
<P>
   The new chip, he said, would make for a ``richer World Wide Web
experience ... And that's the killer app now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is where the eyeballs are, where the customers
are. And that's where the future of business really lies,'' Barrett
said.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's newest microprocessor _ that wafer of etched silicon
that is the brains of a computer _ is off to a less than stellar
start.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentium III, Intel says, has beefed-up capabilities that
enable it to process graphics and other multimedia data faster. It
is being positioned as the enhanced doorway to the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   That message is backed by a $300 million marketing campaign, the
most expensive Intel consumer push ever, which features a symbolic
Intel blue doorway into an Internet chock full of full-motion
video, smooth animations and surround-sound soundtracks.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Clara-based chip maker's efforts behind the Pentium
III also reflect analysts' contentions that the new chip is Intel's
response to competing chip makers such as Advanced Micro Devices
Inc. of Sunnyvale, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Intel now controls about 80 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pentium III name suggests a new generation of a successful
brand,'' said Claude Hazen, a senior semiconductor analyst who
studies Intel for C.E. Unterberg Towbin, the New York investment
bank that took Intel public in 1971. ``It really attacks the
performance market. You could also see it as a response to AMD's
push into the market.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barrett dismisses rivals _ sort of. ``As the market leader,
we look ahead,'' he said, although Intel Chairman Andy Grove
``keeps me paranoid by telling me about the competition.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentium III has already hit a few potholes. Intel executives
went out of their way Wednesday to recast the controversy
surrounding the Pentium III's embedded serial number feature. This
lets a computer containing the chip be tracked on a network,
including the Internet. Intel says the feature is to provide
enhanced security for consumers but privacy advocates protested the
feature.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Intel vowed to ship the Pentium III with the
feature turned off. A user will then have to use software to turn
on the tracking feature. ``Intel heard the input, and we
responded,'' Barrett said.
</P>
<P>
   There are already grumblings that the Pentium III chip may not
deliver on all its promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will Pentium III live up to its hype?'' says the headline over
a critical review of the chip posted on computer publisher Ziff
Davis' Web site. ``Pentium III debuts to yawns,'' proclaimed
another recent headline on CNet.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the growing trade press ennui about the Pentium
III is its visible performance. Barrett brushed those criticisms
aside, saying that the chip will, in time, show its true power.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a preview of things to come,'' he said.

SLIMY RICHARD CHAMBERLAIN SHINES IN DORIS DUKE TELEFILM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Portraying the ickiest piece of slime this side of Snidely
Whiplash, Richard Chamberlain saves ``Too Rich'' from being too
thin. But given its complete title _ ``Too Rich: The Secret Life of
Doris Duke'' _ the four-hour, two-night telefilm can't possibly be
considered a complete success.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain is marvelous as Bernard Lafferty, the obsequious
butler who befriended and, some say, defrauded Duke in her
declining years. But his performance puts the lie to the movie's
title. It is less the secret life of Doris Duke and more the
weasely machinations of the guy who may have had a hand in her
death. The film's chief failing, in fact, is an inability to get
under Duke's skin, to shed light on anything more than her
monumental insecurity at not being loved.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the facelift Duke had at age 79 is to blame: Tough to look
beneath anything tied down that tight. Maybe it was her
reclusiveness: Tough to get to know someone who guards her privacy.
More likely, though, is the decision to boost the film's marquee
value with the legendary Lauren Bacall.
</P>
<P>
   Bacall gets to play Duke in the latter stages of her life, from
the 1970s to the 1990s. (Duke died in 1993 at age 80.) But Bacall
really plays Bacall, gravelly growl and all _ and her version is
not entirely consistent with Lindsay Frost's more generous
portrayal of Duke from age 22 to 40-something.
</P>
<P>
   One could argue that Duke, burned by a succession of failed
relationships, grew darker and more cynical in her dotage. But the
difference between Frost's portrayal and Bacall's is more
pronounced than anything that might be ascribed to creeping
embitterment. While the chameleonlike Frost is made to resemble
Bacall, the emotion she brings to the screen is as different from
Bacall's as a million is from a billion.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, it is Bacall's melancholy performance that may be closer
to true. When Duke laments in the film that she has never been able
to attract people she respects, Louis Bromfield, the Pulitzer
Prize-winning author who was probably the love of her life, says:
``You attract who you are.''
</P>
<P>
   As a streetlight attracts moths, Duke throughout her life
attracted a succession of manipulative fortune hunters eager to
snag a share of the enormous wealth she inherited from her father,
James Buchanan ``Buck'' Duke, co-founder of the American Tobacco
Co. and a principal benefactor of Duke University.
</P>
<P>
   Doris was an adolescent when Buck Duke died and left her a ton
of money (at least $100 million in 1925) and a warning to be wary
of those who would lay claim to her heart.
</P>
<P>
   She took the money but not the advice, and wound up regretting a
lot of choices she made. That much is clear in ``Too Rich.'' Less
clear is the nature of Duke's personality. The film begins with the
drugged and groggy heiress on her deathbed, a tragic-looking
figure. The story then flashes back and forth, sometimes
confusingly, to take in the breadth of Duke's ill-starred choices:
a first marriage to a lying (but well-bred) toad, a fling with
Hawaiian surfing legend Duke Kahanamoku (resulting in pregnancy and
a stillborn daughter), an unlucky marriage to playboy Porfirio
Rubirosa, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a big-name cast that includes Brian Dennehy (as
Bromfield), Michael Nouri (as Rubirosa), Joe Don Baker (as Buck
Duke) and Kathleen Quinlan as Doris' hateful mother, Nanaline, only
Chamberlain, Bacall, Frost and Mare Winningham have enough screen
time to make an impact.
</P>
<P>
   Winningham plays Charlene ``Chandi'' Heffner, a scheming
golddigger whom Duke adopted about five years before she died. She
makes the most of the opportunity, delivering a charming, scheming
Chandi who's as despicable as Lafferty.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain, however, carries the day with a wincing performance
that makes it seem as if Lafferty sucked on lemons all his life.
</P>
<P>
   Even though a police investigation in 1996 cleared Lafferty and
others who were accused of complicity in Duke's death, director
John Erman leaves no doubt that the butler did it.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Erman's film, the butler did it very well.
</P>
<P>
   Too Rich: The Secret Life of Doris Duke. Four-hour TV movie
about the eccentric tobacco heiress' unhappy life and mysterious
death. Starring Lauren Bacall, Richard Chamberlain, Mare
Winningham, Lindsay Frost, Kathleen Quinlan, Brian Dennehy, Michael
Nouri and Brian Stokes-Mitchell. Sunday and Tuesday onm CBS.
Parental guideline rating: TV-PG.

ROSE MCGOWAN IS NO SHRINKING VIOLET 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 
  
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Rose McGowan shows up for an interview in a
magenta sweater ensemble and black leather pants. But don't think
that means that the actress, 23, is getting conservative in her old
age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diesel (a clothing manufacturer) gave me these for free,'' she
impudently chirps through glossy lips about the skintight trousers.
``And I'm all for free.''
</P>
<P>
   McGowan is one of the few people on Earth for whom wearing
leather is an understatement. Both on and off the screen, she's
cultivated a provocateur's persona almost as potent as that of
shock rocker Marilyn Manson, whose Valentine's Day proposal Rose
just accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Except she's sexier. And a lot funnier.
</P>
<P>
   McGowan was the woman who arrived at the MTV Video Music Awards
ceremonies last year in a see-through mesh number with no back and
only a leopard-skin g-string on underneath (she changed into
something less air-conditioned once she got inside).
</P>
<P>
   Her movie resume includes a psychotronic debut as a very angry,
very indulgent teen-age thrill killer in the micro-budgeted
independent ``The Doom Generation,'' and a memorable bit as the
high school tartlet who got sliced up by an automatic garage door
in ``Scream.''
</P>
<P>
   Now McGowan is playing the despicable leader of a San Fernando
Valley high school clique in the satire ``Jawbreaker.'' As
sadistically inclined, popularity-crazed Courtney, she engineers a
prank that unexpectedly results in a close friend's death, then
uses her exceptional powers of deception and intimidation to
deflect the blame onto others.
</P>
<P>
   Sort of a stylized, brightly colored riff on such teen movie
lampoons as ``Heathers,'' ``Jawbreaker'' gives McGowan her best
opportunity yet to display her bent perspective and cutting wit on
screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say `Jawbreaker' is totally camp, but it's not
particularly reality-based,'' she says. ``Courtney is like a high
school Dorothy Parker, very arch and witty and fast and quick. But
if you can liken movie roles to meals, this is candy. Then there's,
like, your four-course dinner. I've yet to have mine so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Not the most ringing endorsement. But then, kind words are not
McGowan's strong suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rose is a very extreme personality in every way,'' says
``Jawbreaker'' writer-director Darren Stein. ``Her style is
extreme, her opinions are kind of out there, but she very firmly
believes in them. She's just one of those people that exists on
some kind of plane that not many people can relate to because it's
so specific. And the beauty of Rose is that she'll say these things
that you might not agree with, but she can explain to you why she
believes that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rose is a really interesting gal,'' adds ``Jawbreaker''
co-star Rebecca Gayheart. ``We're very different girls but we got
along great _ thank God, because we spent a lot of time together.
Rose was fun to work with; she's very witty and intelligent and
intense.''
</P>
<P>
   McGowan credits her offbeat humor to genetics. Her jaundiced
view of the world can be blamed on her parents, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always had a sense of humor, and that's gotten me through
a lot,'' she affirms. ``But to be honest, my parents are really
funny. They're weird _ my dad is certainly very strange _ but
they're funny. My whole family was always treated as the weirdos on
the block, and I think being an outcast to a certain extent forms a
certain humor.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rose was out of sync even when she was surrounded by weirdos
... uh, that is, people with unconventional lifestyles. Her father,
an Irish photographer, and her mother, a Frenchwoman who now works
for Microsoft, raised Rose, the second of six children, in a
Children of God commune near Florence, Italy. The cult combined
Christian beliefs with what now would be called New Age ideas, but
Rose remembers it as primarily a bunch of hippies trying to live
out vague concepts of spiritual lives (the late River Phoenix's
parents were members of the same organization).
</P>
<P>
   Rose recalls her childhood in Italy as a strange mix of the
idyllic and the absurd. There was lots of romping through daisy
fields with her pet lamb. And there was plenty of inexplicable
adult behavior to inspire her peewee cutup's imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was once told by the people in the commune to sit on my bed
all day and learn how to snap my fingers, otherwise God wouldn't
teach me how to drive a car when I was 16,'' she says, cracking up.
``I did it, but I was laughing. I didn't even really understand
what a car or driving was, but I knew it was ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose's parents left the cult and moved to America when she was
9. The family ultimately settled in the Pacific Northwest, where,
by adolescence, their daughter had entered a gloomy, black-wearing
period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, the more outrageous you are, the more attention you
get in a large family,'' she explains. ``I never really did bad
things _ like my brothers! _ but then there was my sister Daisy,
who had curly, curly blond hair and big, saucer blue eyes. She was
the antithesis of me, so guess who the black sheep was? Of course,
I think she did a lot worse stuff and got away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   When she was 13, Rose got the wrong kind of attention for
something she claims she never did: taking drugs. Locked into one
of those residential treatment programs, she fought what she
considered a Kafka-esque effort to break her will with her already
formidable, authority-tweaking attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even there, I was a smartass as much as possible,'' she
recalls. ``They'd farm us out and try to make us play sports, which
wasn't really my bag. I'd say, `I'm sorry. Because of all the LSD
I've taken, I can't tell if there's one basketball or 20 coming at
me.' Ha ha ha. So I never had to play anything. The whole place was
into, like, breaking you. I refused, and that was a very hard
fight, though something I've come up against in a lot of places.''
</P>
<P>
   McGowan eventually ran away from the drug treatment facility
and, at 14, found herself living on her own with no fixed address.
Begging, scrounging and a variety of odd, brief jobs kept her
alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked at this awful, snooty deli, where rich people would
come in on the weekends in sweat pants and full-length fur coats,''
she says of a typical work experience. ``They'd throw their napkins
on the ground and go, `Pick that up, girl!' I got fired for telling
one what she could do with it _ as any normal person would!''
</P>
<P>
   McGowan's natural combativeness was apparently evident when,
while visiting a friend in L.A., she was spotted outside a gym by
Gregg Araki's casting director. The most underground of independent
filmmakers was looking for an angry girl to star in his
menage-a-maniacs opus ``The Doom Generation,'' and something about
McGowan's take-no-guff toughness fit the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Although she didn't particularly enjoy making the no-budget,
sex-anomie-and-violence frolic, McGowan's ``Doom'' performance did
earn her an Independent Spirit Awards nomination. And even though
she'd never before considered an acting career, there was one thing
about the job that she couldn't say regarding previous employments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was real good at it,'' she recognized. ``And I really got a
lot of satisfaction out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, McGowan is hardly one to view show business through
rose-colored glasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is kind of like being in a hothouse environment that's
really extreme and really constant,'' she explains. ``You
experience horrible rejection, and then you're expected, the next
day, to pick yourself up off the floor and be all razzle-dazzle. It
can kind of kick you around a bit ... And it's voluntary!''
</P>
<P>
   In Manson, who's real name is Brian Warner, McGowan apparently
has found both an unlikely calming influence and a partner in the
art of public outrageousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things make me a lot more upset than they make him,'' McGowan
says of the rock superstar whose androgynous, studiedly profane act
has been attacked by religious and parental groups from coast to
coast. ``He's a lot more mellow.''
</P>
<P>
   Director Stein, who gave Warner a cameo part in ``Jawbreaker,''
describes him as ``nothing like you would imagine him to be. In
person, he's really down-to-earth, kind of gawky and nerdy and very
accessible, quite charming and literate and smart as well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's a freak, and I tend to get very protective
of him,'' McGowan continues. ``He's extremely intelligent, probably
one of the smartest people I've ever met. Pretty much anybody who
is pro-free thought gets battered down in America. But I can't say,
obviously, his vibe isn't to provoke certain reactions.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that she lets the scourge of Western civilization get away
with too much at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if he is a pop-culture icon,'' McGowan says of
Manson. ``I tell him, `Pick up that trash that you just threw on
the floor. That's not OK!'''
</P>
<P>
   As for McGowan's own provocative vibe, ``I think things are
funny and they should be stirred up a little bit, and I don't
believe in being boring. Actually, if you read Hollywood history, a
lot of old stars used to do crazy things. Carole Lombard would pull
up to a premiere in a white ambulance. Two guys would carry her out
on a stretcher and she'd just have white surgical tape on her bits
and pieces. Y'know, just making the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did (things like) that since way before I was acting. The
MTV dress came from that. I actually wanted there to be a little
more of an Erte effect to it, but it worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Distinct as she's made herself from the pack of today's
beautiful young actresses, McGowan is still a work in progress.
Even she's not certain where she stands in the public's
consciousness right now. What's a pretty sure bet, though, is that
she won't be forgotten any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to figure out what my persona is, other than just
being myself,'' she muses. ``But if I'm known for anything, I
imagine it's for being a risk-taker and somebody who isn't afraid
of a lot of stuff. I know that certain roles that I want to do are
probably really dark and harsh. That just comes from knowing that I
can go into a really dark place and come out on the other side;
I've already done it many, many times, all of my life.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have any persona, though, I hope that it's just as a
strong female.''

HIGH SCHOOL SATIRE NIPS RATHER THAN BITES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by LANG partners -- ) 
OUR RATING: 2 1/2 STARS 
 
 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ No film genre needs a black comic lampoon like the
high school movie does. Superficial, prom-obsessed pictures are a
drug on the market right now. They can be made cheaply, and don't
require much talent either, to profitably pander to young audiences
that apparently can't get enough idealized representations of
themselves, no matter how lame or unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jawbreaker,'' sad to say, is not the vicious swat of a satire
this cycle deserves. It's spirit is in the right, mean place, but
the movie's exaggerated teen archetypes are as transparent as the
sweeter films' straight-A quarterbacks and Cinderella shy girls.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't help that newly minted writer-director Darren Stein
(whose first movie, ``Sparkler,'' is scheduled for release next
month) has a sense of satire that veers more toward the outre than
the outrageous. Many of the apparent jokes here are kind of
interesting, but only because they make you wonder why somebody
thought they'd be funny.
</P>
<P>
   Take the main idea, if you will. Three of the most popular girls
at Ronald Reagan High School kidnap a fourth as a birthday prank,
toss her into the trunk of a car and drive to a Denny's, where
they'll presumably perform the humiliating ritual of making her eat
pancakes.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, the buddies gagged their victim with a jawbreaker
and duct tape, the big ball of candy slipped down her windpipe, and
when the trunk is opened, she's dead. Courtney, the sadistic leader
of the clique (played with lip-smacking amorality by the future
Mrs. Marilyn Manson, Rose McGowan), quickly hatches an elaborate
scheme to paint the dead girl as a rough-sex addict who was
murdered by some sleazy pickup.
</P>
<P>
   Of Courtney's compatriots, Marcie (Julie Benz) will go along
with anything to stay in the power group, while Julie (``Urban
Legend's'' Rebecca Gayheart) gets pangs of conscience. Unattractive
dweeb girl Fern (Judy Evans Greer), who worshiped the dead girl
from afar, stumbles onto the conspiracy but is bought off by
Courtney's promise/threat to make her over into a teen queen if she
keeps her mouth shut.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the best efforts of Detective, um, Vera Cruz (Pam
Greer), Courtney's little deception moves along swimmingly. But
then that traitor Julie conspires to embarrass her ex-friend at the
prom ... Which, if successful, would of course be a fate worse than
death.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly ``Heathers,'' but mighty derivative of it, ``Jawbreaker''
gets whatever juice it can claim from McGowan. The girl doesn't
flinch from the vilest, cattiest, pettiest behavior. Indeed, she
revels in cartoon wickedness; her sheer glee at exploring just how
perverse she can get in what is, in the end, a mainstream youth
comedy is infectious.
</P>
<P>
   Stein gussies things up in bright candy colors, fun fashion
atrocities, quirky pop-thrash music and fringe culture cameos (Hey,
isn't that the guy from ``Taxi'' no one remembers? Wow, Marilyn
Manson looks like a chemistry major without his makeup!). None of
it gives the movie narrative energy or a consistent comic tone. If
anything, it plays like a disjointed, hyper-real fever dream of
what bad girls are like but really aren't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jawbreaker'' is not as dumb as your average high school movie.
But it's still bubble gum noir, an awkward blend if there ever was
one.

TALE OF COAL MINER'S SON RISES ABOVE, TOO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 3 STARS 
 
 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``October Sky'' tells the more or less true story
of Homer Hickam, a West Virginia coal miner's son whose youthful
fascination with rocket science eventually led to a career with
NASA.
</P>
<P>
   Some Hollywood rocket scientists _ director Joe Johnston
(``Jumanji''), producer Charles Gordon (``Waterworld,'' ``Field of
Dreams'') and screenwriter Lewis Colick (``Ghosts of Mississippi'')
_ have apparently worked over Hickam's memoir ``Rocket Boys'' to a
commercial fare-thee-well. The thing plays like a ``Rocky'' movie
for physics nerds, with a male weepie subplot of father-son
friction thrown in for good measure.
</P>
<P>
   Cliched as the film may be, though, there are far worse things
than promoting learning in a beat-the-odds, rah-rah manner _ and it
must be noted that ``October Sky'' handles the material in a much
more subdued, naturalistic way than the slicker, superficial ``Dead
Poets Society'' did. We're also fortunate that the skeptical,
hard-bitten dad is played by Chris Cooper, whose convincing,
sympathetic presence has grounded hokum of all stripes (``Lone
Star,'' ``The Horse Whisperer,'' ``A Time to Kill'') in honest
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Young Homer, played earnestly by Jake Gyllenhaal, is, like many
Americans, alarmed and inspired when the Soviet Union launches the
first Sputnik satellite in 1957. Too puny to earn the football
scholarship his older brother (Scott Miles) is headed for, Jake is
expected to go straight to the mines once he graduates high school.
</P>
<P>
   But now his head's in the heavens, not down in the hole. Risking
social ostracism by befriending the school geek Quentin (Chris Owen
of ``She's All That'' and TV's ``7th Heaven''), Homer and his pals
Roy Lee (William Lee Scott) and O'Dell (Chad Lindberg), set to
studying jet propulsion and experimenting with increasingly
powerful _ and unpredictable _ homemade rocket launches.
</P>
<P>
   Such activity is encouraged by Miss Riley (Laura Dern), one of
those super-supportive movie teachers who can't be long for this
world. It's pretty much dismissed as pie-in-the-sky nonsense by
everybody else, most particularly Homer's mine foreman father John
(Cooper). Tensions mount when a predictable cave-in, then a strike,
threatens John's livelihood. But gosh darn it, that national
science fair is coming up, and somebody's got to win it and get
their hand shook by Werner Von Braun.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the filmmakers treat the town's doubters with
respect; in the late '50s, outer space was indeed a fantasy realm,
and why should a culture built on the ultimate down-to-earth
business think otherwise? If Homer or one of his buddies gets
uppity about their self-advancement agenda, a working man soon
comes along to remind them that hard labor is noble, too.
</P>
<P>
   This, like a dozen other crowd-massaging touches (Homer's
spunky, encouraging mom, the girl who likes him for his brain more
than his rising local celebrity, etc.), comes off as manufactured
as the movie's overall, triumphal inevitability. But ``October
Sky's'' love of brainwork is genuine enough, and that's really all
the movie needs to rise above its mundane fundamentals.

   &UR; !text! &LR; Robert De Niro plays Sam, an American veteran of the
espionage game, in the thriller ``Ronin,'' which debuts on video
Tuesday. From the outset, it's quite clear that despite his age and
haggard look, Sam is no burnout. He has survived in his dangerous
profession on skill, wiles and guts.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of guts, in one scene the wounded Sam instructs his
cohorts on how to remove a bullet from his side. ``I once removed a
guy's appendix with a grapefruit spoon,'' he says matter-of-factly.
After steering them through the operation, Sam deadpans: ``You
think you can stitch me up on your own? If you don't mind, I'm
gonna pass out.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran director John Frankenheimer (``The Manchurian
Candidate,'' ``52 Pick-Up'') must have had more than a few moments
of recognition while shooting that scene.
</P>
<P>
   After more than 40 years in the business, Frankenheimer has
endured countless barbs and arrows from critics as well as numerous
ups and downs in the industry. Yet the filmmaker, who turns 69
today, has survived. And unlike a lot of his contemporaries, he's
still in the game.
</P>
<P>
   This is more due to Frankenheimer's adaptability than his
particular style. It's interesting to see what two of the deans of
film criticism in the '60s and '70s said about Frankenheimer. In
1969, critic Andrew Sarris called him a ``director of parts at the
expense of the whole.'' While Pauline Kael complained that the plot
to ``Grand Prix'' was ``kind of cheap,'' she didn't mind the
crashes because they were ``gorgeous.''
</P>
<P>
   Those comments sum up much of the knocks against Frankenheimer.
Having learned his craft in early live TV, he was always willing to
push technique (Frankenheimer was one of the first directors to
extensively use hand-held cameras). But that didn't mean that he
shied away from interesting subjects or didn't address substantive
issues.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1965 film ``The Train,'' starring Burt Lancaster, he asks
if the preservation of art is worth the sacrifice of human life.
And certainly ``Candidate,'' ``Seven Days in May,'' ``Seconds'' and
``The Birdman of Alcatraz'' are thought-provoking films.
</P>
<P>
   But Frankenheimer has never made a great film. Perhaps he
doesn't have the singular artistic vision necessary to do so. That,
however, seems to be his saving grace: smart enough to do something
interesting but flexible enough to roll with the punches. When
Frankenheimer's movie career seemed at an end in the '80s and early
'90s, he returned to television to do movies there. A couple of
Emmys helped resuscitate his career. Now with the success of
``Ronin,'' Frankenheimer isn't thought of as an old-timer past his
prime.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Ronin,'' you can see Frankenheimer's strengths and
weaknesses. Basically a chase movie in which the Irish Republican
Army hires five mercenaries, including De Niro and Jean Reno, to
retrieve a briefcase. (Nobody ever finds out what's in the
briefcase. It's a McGuffin, Hitchcock's term for a plot device that
essentially switches on the action because everybody cares about
it.)
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of stylized action, plus twists and turns in the
plot. The dialogue, which reportedly was punched up by David Mamet,
is suitably professionally tough-guyish. In short, it's an
entertaining thriller; it's just not really about much on that
level.
</P>
<P>
   There is one thread running through it, though, that seems
familiar: Hard-boiled Sam falls for the IRA paymistress, Deirdre
(Natascha McElhone). It seems that no matter how tough the guy is
in a Frankenheimer film, he always has a soft spot, and sometimes
that's good, and sometimes it's not. &UR; !end! &LR;  &QL;

   &LR; This 18-song volume includes single tracks from the greatest
acts in that storied label's prime reggae years, including Bob
Marley, Jimmy Cliff, Toots and the Maytals, Steel Pulse, Junior
Murvin, Aswad, Third World and Black Uhuru. Given the riches
involved, I'd have scrunched down the time frame (only five of
these songs were released after 1980) and luxuriated in a few more
tracks from giants such as Marley, Cliff and Toots Hibbert. But the
volume does give a sense of the form's evolution over nearly a
quarter-century and, as such, exceeds even the soundtrack from
``The Harder They Come'' as a quickie overview of reggae's
essential artists. 4 stars

blends the sounds of loud, angry, teen-age rebellion by such groups
as the Who (``A Quick One While He's Away'') and garage band
Creation (``Making Time'') with bittersweet, folky songs by Cat
Stevens and the Faces (``Ooh La La''). Composer (and former Devo
member) Mark Mothersbaugh adds eight baroque instrumental pieces
that nicely complement the movie's wistful images. You won't find a
better soundtrack this year.

MUSIC MATTERED ON `MY SO-CALLED LIFE'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 
  
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In only 19 episodes, ``My So-Called Life''
developed a strong cult following that endures today.
</P>
<P>
   Deemed by critics one of the best TV shows ever, the 1994
program paved the way for such music-tinged teen favorites as
``Dawson's Creek'' and ``Felicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back at a bunch of episodes recently, what strikes the
viewer is the clever use of music by such acts as R.E.M., the
Cranberries, Afghan Whigs and Live.
</P>
<P>
   The songs often complemented the scenes, commenting on or
extending the feelings of the main characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``My So-Called Life,'' which originally aired on ABC-TV and
recently had a highly rated syndicated run on MTV, centered on the
life of suburban teen Angela Chase, portrayed by Golden Globe
winner Claire Danes.
</P>
<P>
   The often-touching show focused on Chase's friends and family,
her first boyfriend, angst, her parents' middle-age crises and the
general turmoil of teen life, love and friendships.
</P>

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES _ It has suspense and romantic comedy. It has
stories that have appeal for the family-entertainment and
indie-minded film crowds. Yet it's what the Santa Clarita
International Film Festival doesn't have that sets it apart.
</P>
<P>
   No surprises to turn a parent's face beet red.
</P>
<P>
   The credo of this kid-friendly festival, which opens today and
runs through Feb. 26, is: no profanity, no senseless violence or
sex, and no naked bodies strutting across the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth annual festival of features, shorts, animation,
documentaries and student productions will be at the Edwards
Cinemas in the Valencia Town Center.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's featured film, ``Undercover Angel,'' and the short
``Dirt on Mom'' are paired at 8:30 p.m. A struggling novelist's
bachelor lifestyle and his writer's block are turned upside down by
a 6-year-old girl in the charming ``Undercover Angel,'' which stars
ex-``Baywatch'' regular Yasmine Bleeth.
</P>
<P>
   A feature with appeal for children and a lesson in activism is
``No More Baths'' from writer-director Tim Nelson. In this family
drama, the 10-year-old son of legal-aid lawyers stages his own
peaceful protest _ by refusing to bathe _ and enlists his friends
to protect their neighborhood clubhouse from demolition. ``No More
Baths'' screens at 2:15 p.m. Saturday, 10 a.m. Monday through
Wednesday, and noon Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   And how about something for the working mothers out there? That
would be the comedy ``Mixed Blessing,'' co-starring Kelly Curtis
(sister of Jamie Lee Curtis) in her feature debut role as a wife
and mother with a career. As the catastrophes mount, she learns
what working moms know all too well: Juggling home and work is a
mixed blessing. Her co-stars are Timothy Bottoms, Taylor Nichols
and Ed McMahon. It screens at 8:15 p.m. Saturday and 5:30 p.m.
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The festival's squeaky-clean subject matter is no reason for
cinema fans to stay away, however. In the Alfred Hitchcock mold of
thrillers comes ``Stranger in Town,'' starring Harry Hamlin. A
drifter is suspected of murder in a small town, and a 13-year-old
boy investigates the crime in this Canadian-produced thriller from
Hallmark Entertainment. ``Stranger'' screens at 9:30 p.m. Tuesday
and noon Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Smoke Signals'' was a darling of last year's Sundance
Festival, ``Naturally Native'' (showing at noon today and 7 p.m.
Tuesday) shows another side of growing up Indian in modern America.
``Naturally Native'' was invited to the 1998 Sundance Festival only
a day after directors Jennifer Farmer and Valerie Red Horse had
finished the editing. It centers on three sisters who were raised
apart from their tribe, who now struggle to start a business
together. Along the way, they come to grips with personal, family
and tribal issues.
</P>
<P>
   Its producers hope to have this feature in theaters nationwide
sometime in August, when it will show in areas with large American
Indian populations, such as Seattle, Albuquerque and Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The German production of ``Queen of the Lake'' adapts ``Swan
Lake,'' the good-vs.-evil tale that pits a prince against a
sorcerer with a spell over a beautiful girl. It screens at 5:30
p.m. Sunday and 10 p.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to features, animation, shorts, documentaries,
student films and screenplay readings, the festival offers panel
discussion of writers, directors, actors and producers talking
about family entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   A lifetime achievement award for film will be presented to
director Delbert Mann by Ernest Borgnine, who starred in his
Oscar-winning film ``Marty.'' The 1955 film will be screened at
3:30 p.m. Sunday. Animator Chuck Jones is the recipient of the
lifetime achievement award for animation, and his cartoons can be
seen at 2:15 p.m. Saturday.

 &HT;    Imus Award to send King biographer packing
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Author Taylor Branch was delighted to win one of the
Imus American Book Awards this week for ``Pillar of Fire,'' but the
Atlanta native doesn't expect the $50,000 prize to change his life
drastically _ or even interrupt his schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did promise my wife we'd take a vacation next year,'' he
says, ``so I'll use part of it for that. But right now I have to
finish work on the ABC miniseries.''
</P>
<P>
   Branch is working with Harry Belafonte and Jon Avnet, who
directed ``Fried Green Tomatoes,'' on a miniseries based on
``Parting the Waters'' and ``Pillar of Fire,'' the first two books
in Branch's trilogy about the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and the
civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   The miniseries, scheduled to air next February, will focus on
the period from the Montgomery bus boycott of the 1950s to the
Montgomery march in the 1960s. Filming in Birmingham, Montgomery
and Atlanta will begin in mid-May.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Branch is finishing the final book in the trilogy:
``At Canaan's Edge'' will cover the years 1965 to '68.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the titles are out of the Book of Exodus,'' Branch says
of his trilogy. ``The metaphor there is that Moses could not enter
Canaan, but was allowed to look over at the Promised Land.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A writer to watch: Tom Clancy didn't start out as a
best-selling author with a major publisher. The former insurance
agent published ``The Hunt for Red October'' with the Naval
Institute Press, a small publisher that had little experience with
fiction. You know the rest of that story.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Wes DeMott of Naples, Fla., is hoping the same thing
happens to him. The 46-year-old former FBI agent is the author of
``Vapors,'' a political thriller scheduled for publication in April
by Admiral House Publishing. The tiny Florida publisher is betting
the house on DeMott with a $200,000 marketing campaign, full-page
ads in Publishers Weekly and a 35,000-copy first printing.
</P>
<P>
   DeMott, who just finished a national pre-publication tour to
bookstores, describes ``Vapors'' as a political thriller that's
also a love story. ``It's action-packed, but I included a romantic
element because most of the feedback I get is from women. And
that's what they're interested in.''
</P>
<P>
   The plot centers on an aerospace engineer who is trying to save
his job. In the process, he discovers a major accounting fraud in
the firm. ``He gets involved with a woman who works for the
Citizens Coalition Against Government Waste,'' DeMott says. ``He
starts out trying to save his job and ends up trying to save his
life.''
</P>
<P>
   DeMott, a self-taught writer, draws on his FBI experience to
create realistic scenes. ``I've been in lots of fights, been
stabbed, had 16 bones broken. So when I write about a conflict, you
know it's real.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Refreshing reading: If you've picked up a carton of Diet Coke
lately, you probably got a free excerpt from one of six books.
</P>
<P>
   The soft drink company's marketing campaign features samples
from Elmore Leonard's ``Be Cool,'' Maeve Binchy's ``Tara Road,''
Lisa Scottoline's ``Mistaken Identity,'' Barbara Taylor Bradford's
``A Sudden Change of Heart,'' Nora Roberts' ``River's End'' and
``Chicken Soup for the Couple's Soul,'' the latest in Health
Communications' popular ``Chicken Soup'' advice series.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign already has had an impact on book sales. Dan Harvey
of Putnam's says the publisher has increased the printing for
Roberts' novel to 400,000 from an initial 275,000 copies. ``This
can be attributed to Nora's growing popularity, as well as the Diet
Coke promotion,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Be a character: Speaking of Roberts, the best-selling novelist
will make you a character in one of her books if you win a contest
sponsored by Putnam Publishing Group. Readers can enter by clicking
on http://www.barnesandnoble.com on the Internet or by picking up
sweepstakes forms at Barnes &AMP; Noble Booksellers. A random drawing
is scheduled April 13. What kind of character will you be? It's
entirely up to Roberts, who has written about everyone from
princesses to marine biologists.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Rocket man: Astronaut John Glenn has signed a deal with Bantam
to write his autobiography with former Atlanta writer Nick Taylor.
Taylor is the author of ``A Necessary End,'' a 1994 memoir about
dealing with his aging father. The Glenn book will cover his
spaceflight last year as well as his political and personal life.
Bantam plans to publish in the fall.

ROSE MCGOWAN IS NO SHRINKING VIOLET

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Rose McGowan shows up for an interview in a
magenta sweater ensemble and black leather pants. But don't think
that means that the actress, 23, is getting conservative in her old
age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diesel (a clothing manufacturer) gave me these for free,'' she
impudently chirps through glossy lips about the skintight trousers.
``And I'm all for free.''
</P>
<P>
   McGowan is one of the few people on Earth for whom wearing
leather is an understatement. Both on and off the screen, she's
cultivated a provocateur's persona almost as potent as that of
shock rocker Marilyn Manson, whose Valentine's Day proposal Rose
just accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Except she's sexier. And a lot funnier.
</P>
<P>
   McGowan was the woman who arrived at the MTV Video Music Awards
ceremonies last year in a see-through mesh number with no back and
only a leopard-skin g-string on underneath (she changed into
something less air-conditioned once she got inside).
</P>
<P>
   Her movie resume includes a psychotronic debut as a very angry,
very indulgent teen-age thrill killer in the micro-budgeted
independent ``The Doom Generation,'' and a memorable bit as the
high school tartlet who got sliced up by an automatic garage door
in ``Scream.''
</P>
<P>
   Now McGowan is playing the despicable leader of a San Fernando
Valley high school clique in the satire ``Jawbreaker.'' As
sadistically inclined, popularity-crazed Courtney, she engineers a
prank that unexpectedly results in a close friend's death, then
uses her exceptional powers of deception and intimidation to
deflect the blame onto others.
</P>
<P>
   Sort of a stylized, brightly colored riff on such teen movie
lampoons as ``Heathers,'' ``Jawbreaker'' gives McGowan her best
opportunity yet to display her bent perspective and cutting wit on
screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say `Jawbreaker' is totally camp, but it's not
particularly reality-based,'' she says. ``Courtney is like a high
school Dorothy Parker, very arch and witty and fast and quick. But
if you can liken movie roles to meals, this is candy. Then there's,
like, your four-course dinner. I've yet to have mine so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Not the most ringing endorsement. But then, kind words are not
McGowan's strong suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rose is a very extreme personality in every way,'' says
``Jawbreaker'' writer-director Darren Stein. ``Her style is
extreme, her opinions are kind of out there, but she very firmly
believes in them. She's just one of those people that exists on
some kind of plane that not many people can relate to because it's
so specific. And the beauty of Rose is that she'll say these things
that you might not agree with, but she can explain to you why she
believes that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rose is a really interesting gal,'' adds ``Jawbreaker''
co-star Rebecca Gayheart. ``We're very different girls but we got
along great _ thank God, because we spent a lot of time together.
Rose was fun to work with; she's very witty and intelligent and
intense.''
</P>
<P>
   McGowan credits her offbeat humor to genetics. Her jaundiced
view of the world can be blamed on her parents, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always had a sense of humor, and that's gotten me through
a lot,'' she affirms. ``But to be honest, my parents are really
funny. They're weird _ my dad is certainly very strange _ but
they're funny. My whole family was always treated as the weirdos on
the block, and I think being an outcast to a certain extent forms a
certain humor.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rose was out of sync even when she was surrounded by weirdos
... uh, that is, people with unconventional lifestyles. Her father,
an Irish photographer, and her mother, a Frenchwoman who now works
for Microsoft, raised Rose, the second of six children, in a
Children of God commune near Florence, Italy. The cult combined
Christian beliefs with what now would be called New Age ideas, but
Rose remembers it as primarily a bunch of hippies trying to live
out vague concepts of spiritual lives (the late River Phoenix's
parents were members of the same organization).
</P>
<P>
   Rose recalls her childhood in Italy as a strange mix of the
idyllic and the absurd. There was lots of romping through daisy
fields with her pet lamb. And there was plenty of inexplicable
adult behavior to inspire her peewee cutup's imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was once told by the people in the commune to sit on my bed
all day and learn how to snap my fingers, otherwise God wouldn't
teach me how to drive a car when I was 16,'' she says, cracking up.
``I did it, but I was laughing. I didn't even really understand
what a car or driving was, but I knew it was ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose's parents left the cult and moved to America when she was
9. The family ultimately settled in the Pacific Northwest, where,
by adolescence, their daughter had entered a gloomy, black-wearing
period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, the more outrageous you are, the more attention you
get in a large family,'' she explains. ``I never really did bad
things _ like my brothers! _ but then there was my sister Daisy,
who had curly, curly blond hair and big, saucer blue eyes. She was
the antithesis of me, so guess who the black sheep was? Of course,
I think she did a lot worse stuff and got away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   When she was 13, Rose got the wrong kind of attention for
something she claims she never did: taking drugs. Locked into one
of those residential treatment programs, she fought what she
considered a Kafka-esque effort to break her will with her already
formidable, authority-tweaking attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even there, I was a smartass as much as possible,'' she
recalls. ``They'd farm us out and try to make us play sports, which
wasn't really my bag. I'd say, `I'm sorry. Because of all the LSD
I've taken, I can't tell if there's one basketball or 20 coming at
me.' Ha ha ha. So I never had to play anything. The whole place was
into, like, breaking you. I refused, and that was a very hard
fight, though something I've come up against in a lot of places.''
</P>
<P>
   McGowan eventually ran away from the drug treatment facility
and, at 14, found herself living on her own with no fixed address.
Begging, scrounging and a variety of odd, brief jobs kept her
alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked at this awful, snooty deli, where rich people would
come in on the weekends in sweat pants and full-length fur coats,''
she says of a typical work experience. ``They'd throw their napkins
on the ground and go, `Pick that up, girl!' I got fired for telling
one what she could do with it _ as any normal person would!''
</P>
<P>
   McGowan's natural combativeness was apparently evident when,
while visiting a friend in L.A., she was spotted outside a gym by
Gregg Araki's casting director. The most underground of independent
filmmakers was looking for an angry girl to star in his
menage-a-maniacs opus ``The Doom Generation,'' and something about
McGowan's take-no-guff toughness fit the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Although she didn't particularly enjoy making the no-budget,
sex-anomie-and-violence frolic, McGowan's ``Doom'' performance did
earn her an Independent Spirit Awards nomination. And even though
she'd never before considered an acting career, there was one thing
about the job that she couldn't say regarding previous employments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was real good at it,'' she recognized. ``And I really got a
lot of satisfaction out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, McGowan is hardly one to view show business through
rose-colored glasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is kind of like being in a hothouse environment that's
really extreme and really constant,'' she explains. ``You
experience horrible rejection, and then you're expected, the next
day, to pick yourself up off the floor and be all razzle-dazzle. It
can kind of kick you around a bit ... And it's voluntary!''
</P>
<P>
   In Manson, who's real name is Brian Warner, McGowan apparently
has found both an unlikely calming influence and a partner in the
art of public outrageousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things make me a lot more upset than they make him,'' McGowan
says of the rock superstar whose androgynous, studiedly profane act
has been attacked by religious and parental groups from coast to
coast. ``He's a lot more mellow.''
</P>
<P>
   Director Stein, who gave Warner a cameo part in ``Jawbreaker,''
describes him as ``nothing like you would imagine him to be. In
person, he's really down-to-earth, kind of gawky and nerdy and very
accessible, quite charming and literate and smart as well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's a freak, and I tend to get very protective
of him,'' McGowan continues. ``He's extremely intelligent, probably
one of the smartest people I've ever met. Pretty much anybody who
is pro-free thought gets battered down in America. But I can't say,
obviously, his vibe isn't to provoke certain reactions.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that she lets the scourge of Western civilization get away
with too much at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if he is a pop-culture icon,'' McGowan says of
Manson. ``I tell him, `Pick up that trash that you just threw on
the floor. That's not OK!'''
</P>
<P>
   As for McGowan's own provocative vibe, ``I think things are
funny and they should be stirred up a little bit, and I don't
believe in being boring. Actually, if you read Hollywood history, a
lot of old stars used to do crazy things. Carole Lombard would pull
up to a premiere in a white ambulance. Two guys would carry her out
on a stretcher and she'd just have white surgical tape on her bits
and pieces. Y'know, just making the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did (things like) that since way before I was acting. The
MTV dress came from that. I actually wanted there to be a little
more of an Erte effect to it, but it worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Distinct as she's made herself from the pack of today's
beautiful young actresses, McGowan is still a work in progress.
Even she's not certain where she stands in the public's
consciousness right now. What's a pretty sure bet, though, is that
she won't be forgotten any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to figure out what my persona is, other than just
being myself,'' she muses. ``But if I'm known for anything, I
imagine it's for being a risk-taker and somebody who isn't afraid
of a lot of stuff. I know that certain roles that I want to do are
probably really dark and harsh. That just comes from knowing that I
can go into a really dark place and come out on the other side;
I've already done it many, many times, all of my life.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have any persona, though, I hope that it's just as a
strong female.''

   ELEPHANTS-VIRUS (Undated) _ The death of a much-loved baby

that researchers think is a major cause of death worldwide among
young elephants in captivity, and a serious threat to their

AOL NAMES NETSCAPE CO-FOUNDER TO EXECUTIVE POST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARD IWATA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Netscape Communications Corp. co-founder Marc
Andreessen will become the chief technology officer of American
Online when the two companies merge this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Andreessen, 27, will evaluate new technologies and serve as
AOL's liaison to the high-tech world.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Marc Andreessen ... we are taking a major step to ensure
all of our interactive brands will benefit from the latest
technological developments today and in the years to come,'' Steve
Case, the chairman and chief executive of AOL, said Wednesday in
announcing the appointment.
</P>
<P>
   America Online of Dulles, Va., joined the on-line merger frenzy
in November, trumpeting a $4.3 billion stock swap deal with
Mountain View, Calif.-based Netscape. The deal merges AOL, the
world's largest consumer on-line network, with Netscape, the
pioneering company whose browser software popularized the World
Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   AOL is rumbling into the next century as the blue-chip company
of cyberspace. With more than 16 million members, the company had
$88 million in profits on $960 million in revenue in the second
quarter ended Jan. 27.
</P>
<P>
   But AOL stands at a crossroads in its evolution. As Internet
commerce grows, competition promises to get more brutal from media
giants like Walt Disney and NBC. Telecommunication and cable
companies, such as AT&AMP;T and TCI, will offer hungry consumers
greater bandwidth and faster access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Case is optimistic about the future of the united company
and said the merger with Netscape was ``going very well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We like the deal, the people and the products,'' he said. ``We
see Netscape as highly complementary to AOL. Over the past year,
Netscape has smartly repositioned itself for the next stage of the
Internet's development by focusing on the portal and e-commerce
business. So we're looking forward to helping take the Internet to
the next level.''

NETSCAPE ICON SEES GOOD TIMES AHEAD FOR AOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Marc Andreessen, the hyperactive 27-year-old
co-founder of Netscape Communications Corp., will soon become the
chief technology officer for America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Andreessen has had a colorful tenure at Netscape since he
started the company in 1994. He earned notoriety by posing barefoot
on the cover of Time magazine and was once labeled a technological
know-nothing by GQ magazine.
</P>
<P>
   In an telephone interview with Andreessen Wednesday evening, the
Silicon Valley wunderkind discussed his new job and his old image.
Here are excerpts from that interview:
</P>
<P>
   Q: There has been speculation that you were reluctant to sell
Netscape to AOL?
</P>
<P>
   A: No I wasn't. I don't know where that came from. When we got
really serious about talking about this, I was a big fan of the
deal. For the last two years, AOL's been on a tear. They've clearly
figured out how to take the Internet to a mass medium. I was real
impressed with their folks. With their team. Been real impressed.
The opportunity that this company had is so enormous.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How so?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's enormous. AOL and Netscape, by most reckonings, are the
two leading Internet companies. Put the two together, and you have
unquestionably the No. 1 Internet company. And the last five years
have been sort of a prologue. In the next five years, there's going
to be more happening than we have seen so far, by an order of a
magnitude. AOL ought to be in the middle of everything that's
happening.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you see happening in these next five years?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Internet is now mass media, but its only penetrated about
25 percent of American homes. That should go to something very
close to 100 percent. The Internet is going to become incredibly
central to our lives. Sort of medium and technology that will touch
everything that we do. Everything from e-commerce to education to
government to entertainment to communications. New things have
happened in the last year than have happened in all the previous
years put together. It's change after change after change.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How involved were you in the sellout? You were on a leave of
absence, weren't you?
</P>
<P>
   A: I was on my sabbatical for two days. And I was already
starting to climb the walls. And then I came back in, after about
two days, and started working pretty seriously on this, because I
thought I could be useful. I was just coming off a year and half
period where I was running products and marketing. I worked on the
deal for most of my sabbatical.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An unflattering GQ magazine profile basically said you
weren't really doing anything at Netscape. That you were just a
poster boy.
</P>
<P>
   A: Make that imposter boy. Actually, what it said was that I
hadn't had anything to do with Mosaic (the precursor to the
Netscape browser software). That story ended when Netscape started.
So I just basically point to Netscape and say, ``OK, what else do
you want?''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What will be your duties at AOL?
</P>
<P>
   A: At AOL, I'll be looking at a lot of new technologies.
Services over television or over handheld PCs or phones. I'll be
working on AOL's relationship with Silicon Valley. Overseeing the
policy issues that AOL faces.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You have to be very rich by now. Don't you want to kick back
now?
</P>
<P>
   A: My sabbatical was a glimpse of what it would be like to not
do anything. Like I said, I lasted two days.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why doesn't anyone make money on the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's not true. AOL is making a significant amount of money
today. And I think they're in great shape for the future. But a lot
of companies choose not to make money because they're growing their
customer bases by pouring money into marketing. The investors think
that's a much bigger opportunity. It's a massive reallocation of
capital. It's a sloppy process. There's going to be money poured
into companies that will go bankrupt. But it's a process, sort of
American capitalism at its best. New ideas are emerging left and
right, and they're all getting funded. It's developing much faster
than before.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But analysts and business publications are predicting a
crash.
</P>
<P>
   A: AOL is a very instructive lesson on this one. The same thing
was said about AOL for the last five years. Since that time they've
gone from a market cap of $300 million to like $80 billion now.
There are other companies, like AOL, that are going to be huge. To
bet against that is a bet I'm not willing to make.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Show me this Kosovo that needs our
help
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The president wants to send peacekeeping troops to Kosovo.
Opposition is being expressed by the Congress. The Congress is
right.
</P>
<P>
   Who among us can even find Kosovo on the map? That may or may
not be pertinent. But time was when a vast majority of Americans
couldn't have found Vietnam on the map. We learned that one the
hard way.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 10 years, I've traveled to places I'd hardly ever
heard of, places with problems I had a difficult time even
defining. Bosnia comes to mind.
</P>
<P>
   This much I came to understand: Some things aren't ever going to
be right. These are countries and people with too much history and,
worse, too much religion.
</P>
<P>
   The Balkan states, in particular.
</P>
<P>
   They're like the wrong pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. No way they
can be made to fit into a pretty picture.
</P>
<P>
   No way you can bring together the religions of East and West as
good neighbors, not even at the point of a gun.
</P>
<P>
   America always wants to take the side of whichever people is
taking the worst of it. We like to think of ourselves as a nation
that sticks up for the underdog, champion of the downtrodden and
such.
</P>
<P>
   But give them a leg up, and enough weapons, and soon enough
they'll have their foot on the throat of their former oppressors,
and they'll be just as cruel and just as vicious.
</P>
<P>
   Those people have hated each other for centuries. When it's
their turn, they'll not turn the other cheek.
</P>
<P>
   America seems fast on her way to becoming the policewoman of the
world, Lord help us. If so, we're heading in the same direction as
the old Soviet Union, down history's drain.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviets had good reason to be involved. It was their own
back yard, and they managed to keep things together, and keep the
various factions apart, for almost half a century after World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   They did it through the sheer weight of Soviet armor. They set
enough tanks on top of the people to hold them down, and they
finally went bankrupt doing it.
</P>
<P>
   Give them credit. The Soviet Union may well have been the
greatest peacekeeping force the world has ever known, second only
perhaps to the Roman legions of old.
</P>
<P>
   We're just now beginning to appreciate what a good job the
Soviets did, now that we're beginning to take on that job
ourselves.

SAN FRANCISCO WEIGHS LAW ON BIAS AGAINST FAT PEOPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RACHEL GORDON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It's against the law in San Francisco to
discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, ancestry, age,
sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability and place of
birth.
</P>
<P>
   The city may soon make it illegal to discriminate against people
who are overweight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real thing. In the world of stand-up comedy, fat jokes
are standard currency,'' said Board of Supervisors President Tom
Ammiano, himself an occasional stand-up comic. ``When I was a
teacher, I particularly witnessed the persecution of kids who are
heavy. We're programmed to think it's funny, but it's not.''
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano has asked that the city attorney and the Human Rights
Commission look into drafting legislation that would add the
category of fat people to the list of protected classes.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Carole Cullum, who serves on the city's Board of Permit
Appeals and describes herself as a fat woman, said Ammiano was onto
something.
</P>
<P>
   Overweight children, she said, are the last to be picked for the
volleyball team and other activities, and hefty adults face
discrimination in the workplace and in housing. On top of that are
the jokes and verbal taunts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the last safe group to discriminate against,'' she said.
``It's time that it's not safe anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano made the proposal in the aftermath of a protest against
a new advertising campaign for the 24 Hour Fitness centers.
</P>
<P>
   One billboard shows an artist's rendition of a space alien and
reads: ``When they come, they'll eat the fat ones first.''
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators, many of them large, took to the streets Monday
and chanted, danced and waved signs, one of which read: ``Bite My
Fat Alien Butt.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the protesters, Max Airborne, said Ammiano's anti-bias
proposal was ``like a pipe dream.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought something like this would happen in my
lifetime,'' said Airborne, 33, a college student.
</P>
<P>
   Adding protections under city law may make people think twice
about maligning heavy people, advocates say. Violators of the
anti-discrimination law face an investigation by the Human Rights
Commission and possible fines.
</P>
<P>
   Rhea Serpan, executive director the San Francisco Chamber of
Commerce, initially snickered at Ammiano's idea, but after thinking
about it said it deserved serious consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that for some people this is a major concern,'' he
said. ``Clearly we have opposed discrimination wherever it is, and
if something does move forward on the legislative front, we'll look
at it.''

LAKE CONSTANCE: NATIONS SHARE ONE OF EUROPE'S BEST-KEPT SECRETS

<P>
   MAINAU, Germany _ A floral bouquet. A bottle of wine. A
leisurely stroll through an idyllic village. A picnic beside a
lake.
</P>
<P>
   What better ways to celebrate a romantic occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Along Lake Constance _ known here as the Bodensee and one of
Europe's best-kept secrets _ an entire island is dedicated to
flowers. Lush vineyards cover hillsides that slope gently toward
the water. Enchanting towns celebrate the history and culture of
three nations: Germany, Switzerland and Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Although picnicking may have to wait until spring or summer, few
settings are more soothing than a shaded park beside this vast
inland sea, with a sailboat flotilla presenting a rainbow of colors
just offshore. Or forget the worries of the world aboard the top
deck of a sun-kissed passenger ferry as it slowly proceeds from one
community to another.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Europeans have made Lake Constance a favored playground
even as outsiders gravitated to other parts of the continent.
</P>
<P>
   Formed by the Rhine River, this is Europe's third-largest
landlocked lake, its shoreline covering about 108 miles in southern
Germany, 45 miles in northern Switzerland and 17 miles in western
Austria. The lake has three parts: the Obersee, or Upper Lake, that
connects Constance, Germany, and Bregenz, Austria; and fingers to
the west known as the Untersee, or Lower Lake; and the Uberlingen
Sea.
</P>
<P>
   On a clear day, the Swiss Alps provide a riveting backdrop to
the south. Boat excursions allow easy access to picturesque
Stein-am-Rhein and Schaffausen along the Rhine in Switzerland.
Germany's Bavaria and Black Forest regions are only a short drive
or train ride removed.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, you'll be content to linger along the lake.
Constance (Konstanz on most maps and in some guidebooks), at the
western extreme of the Obersee, or Lindau on its northeast shore _
both in Germany _ make ideal bases because of a plethora of hotels
and restaurants. From mid-April to mid-October, a well-coordinated
system of steamers and larger boats connects major destinations.
</P>
<P>
   Many visitors, especially Europeans, prefer to travel between
villages _ or circle the lake _ by bicycle. Cycling and walking
routes are designated, and tourist offices can provide maps.
</P>
<P>
   Highlights are numerous, none more so than Mainau, the flower
island. So let's start there, at the northwest corner of the Upper
Lake, and tour in a clockwise direction. These are among the many
temptations:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MAINAU, GERMANY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Beginning each March, 6,000 types of orchids blossom on this
111-acre island owned by the family of Swedish count Lennart
Bernadotte. And that's just the beginning. Millions of tulips,
hyacinths and daffodils bloom in April; May brings a wondrous
display of rhododendrons; summer showcases 1,200 species and
strains of roses; and autumn welcomes more than 20,000 dahlias.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds more local and exotic flowers abound. So do tropical
fruits normally associated with more southerly climates; they
thrive here because the massive lake retains the warmth of the
summer sun and shares it with the surrounding land year-round.
</P>
<P>
   Mainau also is a preferred location for birdwatchers. About 230
species of birds have been identified in the region; migrating
birds from Scandinavia and Eastern Europe are observed during
spring and fall along the lake.
</P>
<P>
   Other attractions include Germany's largest butterfly house and
an outdoor display of large floral animals. A baroque castle _ now
the Bernadotte family home _ and church date back more than 250
years. Several restaurants provide sustenance.
</P>
<P>
   Cars are banned on the island, and walking paths connect all
areas; a map/guide is essential for full enjoyment and is available
near entrances.
</P>
<P>
   Open year-round, Mainau is close enough to the mainland that a
footbridge provides access. Admission to the island is about $10
per person. City buses cover the approximate five-mile distance
from Constance to the bridge entrance; fare is about $1.40. Or take
boats from Constance or Meersburg, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MEERSBURG GERMANY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This beautifully situated two-tiered town, best appreciated
visually when approaching the harbor by boat, is notable for the
vineyards that hug its center and for its remarkable architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's southernmost wine-growing district, known as Baden,
ends along the northern shore of Lake Constance, and restaurants
and cafes in even the smallest villages serve wine produced within
a stone's throw. The most popular are from Meersburg (population
5,000).
</P>
<P>
   The main structure of Meersburg's renowned Old Palace, a massive
fortress that dominates the Upper Town, originated in the seventh
century. A separate New Palace is ``only'' 250 years old. Guided
tours of various buildings reveal centuries-old paintings,
furnishings, medieval armor and weapons and other artifacts.
Classical music concerts in summer celebrate the medieval
traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Other attractions include separate museums that focus on
religious history, winemaking, German newspapers and airships. Also
enticing is a market square surrounded by gable-walled houses. The
Lower Town is popular for its outdoor eateries and lakeside
promenade.
</P>
<P>
   Good walking shoes are a must to negotiate the hilly terrain.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
FRIEDRICHSHAFEN, GERMANY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With 55,000 residents, this is the second-largest city along the
lake (behind Constance) and is best known as the home of Count
Ferdinand Graf von Zeppelin, who assembled the first dirigible
airship that went aloft over the lake 99 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest exhibition on the history and technology of
airships is housed within the 3-year-old Zeppelin Museum at the
harbor. After a half-century hiatus, zeppelin construction has
resumed, and the first newer-model airship is frequently seen
hovering above the lake.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
LINDAU, GERMANY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Located near the Germany-Austria border on an island connected
to the mainland by road and rail bridges, Lindau offers a
resortlike ambience with a lakeside promenade flanked by hotels,
restaurants and a network of pedestrian-only walkways.
</P>
<P>
   Open-air cafes and restaurants are situated on almost every
corner in the shadow of colorful buildings representing the Gothic,
Renaissance and Baroque eras. There is no better place in this
region for people-watching or relaxing with a loved one.
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent historical attractions date to the 15th
century: the town hall, with an elaborate faade and an
18,000-volume imperial library; and St. Peter's Church, which
contains what are believed to be the only remaining frescoes
painted by Hans Holbein the Elder.
</P>
<P>
   If you are driving and don't have a hotel reservation, consider
parking on the mainland and taking a free shuttle to the island.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BREGENZ, AUSTRIA &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This city is known worldwide for its annual four-week music
festival in July and August. A floating stage provides a
spectacular setting for operas and other performances; terraced
seating accommodates more than 5,000 spectators.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis on culture extends year-round at a new art museum _
the largest museum built in Austria since World War II. Historical
attractions include St. Martin's Tower, the oldest Baroque
structure along Lake Constance.
</P>
<P>
   Also from Bregenz, a cable car rises into the Pfander hills
almost 2,000 feet above the water. A trip here on a pretty day is
rewarded by sweeping views of the lake and is a good starting point
for hikes within the Bregenz Forest.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
RORSCHACH/ST. GALLEN, SWITZERLAND &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This town of 10,000 residents on the southeast shore boasts a
lovely lakeside promenade and park and some of the area's
stateliest homes.
</P>
<P>
   It also serves as the closest gateway to St. Gallen, which is
seven miles off the lake but worthy of a 15-minute train ride (or
car trip) if only because of its world-famous library housed in a
former Benedictine abbey.
</P>
<P>
   The library's Rococo Hall, created in the mid-18th century,
features magnificent stucco work and frescoes. The inventory
includes more than 130,000 books and 2,000 rare manuscripts; some
works from the ninth to 11th centuries originally belonged to the
abbey.
</P>
<P>
   Also in St. Gallen are museums celebrating art, history, natural
history, textiles and music boxes.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CONSTANCE, GERMANY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Believed to be founded as early as the sixth century, the lake
area's namesake town is the site of the only election of a pope
north of the Alps, in 1417 during the Council of Constance.
</P>
<P>
   Constance's rich history remains at the heart of its charm, with
much of the medieval core surviving. The building where Martin V
was elected stands near the water. The Minster of Our Dear Lady
originated in 1052 in the Roman style, and subsequent expansion and
alterations reflect other architectural periods. The gothic Church
of the Holy Trinity dates to 1300, and churches, towers and other
buildings are centuries old.
</P>
<P>
   Even the town's most impressive lodging facility, the
Steigenberger Inselhotel, is steeped in history. The 13th-century
building was once a Dominican cloister, and the original arches
remain. Ferdinand Graf von Zeppelin was born here in 1838.
</P>
<P>
   Step back in time along numerous pedestrian-only walkways and
twisting alleys that spread from the harbor into the old town.
These paths also are lined by shops, pubs, wine taverns and
restaurants whose indoor and outdoor tables are filled with
students from the city's large university. At any moment an
impromptu sing-along or concert may commence.
</P>
<P>
   Constance, with about 75,000 residents, is a center for opera
and theater, and the Rosgarten Museum focuses on the cultural and
artistic history of this entire region.
</P>
<P>
   A five-mile ride by bicycle or bus, across the Rhine River and
through the city's newer section, leads to Mainau.

`PYHROTECHNIC INSANITARIUM': STEP RIGHT UP FOR THE CARNIVAL OF
CHAOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The title of Mark Dery's disappointing new book about millennial
America, ``The Pyrotechnic Insanitarium,'' comes from a phrase once
used to describe the turn-of-the century amusement parks of Coney
Island, a blaze of lights and frenetic rides, a ``carnival of
chaos'' that celebrated and parodied the country's new modernity, a
``madcap celebration of emotional abandon and exposed flesh, speed
and sensory overload, natural disasters and machines gone
haywire.''
</P>
<P>
   A hundred years later, on the brink of the millennium, all of
America, Dery suggests, has become a ``pyrotechnic insanitarium,''
a madhouse reeling from technological change and moral
disequilibrium, a hall of mirrors in which it is increasingly
difficult to separate reality from virtual reality, a world in
which even nature seems out of joint.
</P>
<P>
   In this volume, Dery addresses many of the same issues he
examined in ``Escape Velocity,'' his fascinating 1996 study of
cyberculture. Whereas that earlier book was grounded in Dery's
reporting on fringe subcultures _ on cyberhippies, technopagans,
avant-garde roboticists, virtual reality designers and body-art
performance artists _ ``Insanitarium'' is a far more speculative
work, filled with the observations of other writers and Dery's own
editorial opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those opinions are little more than vague platitudes:
``On the cusp of the millennium, the only certainty seems to be
that the Uncertainty Principle will be an ever-present fact of
everyday life.'' Others are ridiculously broad (and often
ill-informed) generalizations.
</P>
<P>
   Shrugging off the problematic legacy of Russia's Communist past,
Dery grandly declares that the country's current woes are a result
of ``the laissez-faire `shock therapy' of radical free-market
economists like Jeffrey Sachs.'' And in another chapter, he
cavalierly asserts that ``the by now universal realization that the
government does, in fact, flagrantly flout the will of the people,
trample the law and attempt to cover up its skulduggery'' casts ``a
somewhat charitable light on conspiracy theory.''
</P>
<P>
   As Dery sees it, we are living in an ``Age of Extremes'':
``extreme sports, extreme fighting, extreme weather, extreme
science (pigs that produce human hemoglobin), extreme TV (`World's
Scariest Police Chases'), extreme diseases (flesh-eating bacteria),
extreme sex (the mainstreaming of S-and-M via `Basic Instinct' and
bondage couture), extreme art (performance artist Bob Flanagan
nailing his penis to a board), extreme toys (Postal, a thrill-kill
video game that enables kids to waste innocent bystanders as they
beg for mercy), extreme beliefs (the white supremacist Larry Wayne
Harris' dream of unleashing bubonic plague in the New York subway),
extreme behavior (Mike Tyson biting off Evander Holyfield's ear)
and, most profoundly, economic extremes: the yawning income gap
between the economic elite and the overworked, overdrawn
millions.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a time when hyperbole is the order of the day, and books
routinely announce ``The End of Nature'' (Bill McKibben), ``The End
of Work'' (Jeremy Rifkin), ``The End of Science'' (John Horgan),
``The End of Education'' (Neil Postman), ``The End of the Nation
State'' (Kenichi Ohmae and Jean-Marie Guehenno), ``The End of
Affluence'' (Jeffrey Madrick), ``The End of Equality'' (Mickey
Kaus) and ``The End of History and the Last Man'' (Francis
Fukuyama).
</P>
<P>
   Though often cleverly put, much of what Dery says in this book
sounds terribly familiar. That we live in an age fraught with
anxieties about random violence (terrorism, lone psychos, radical
militiamen), nuclear proliferation and terrible new diseases (AIDS,
Ebola, `mad cow disease').
</P>
<P>
   That the digital revolution and advances in genetic engineering
have contributed to our sense of cultural vertigo. That today's
media landscape is dominated by ``solitary obsessions and
subcultural crazes'' from ``alien abductions to encounters with
angels, recovered memories to multiple personalities, satanic
ritual abuse to serial-killer fandom.''
</P>
<P>
   We've heard all of this before, in many cases from the many
cultural critics Dery quotes so copiously in these pages.
</P>
<P>
   When Dery turns from the big picture to specific social
phenomenon, the results are considerably more interesting. He
argues that the image of the ``evil clown'' has recently become a
popular trope _ from the Joker in ``Batman'' to Jack Torrance, the
gleeful ax-wielding killer played by Jack Nicholson in ``The
Shining,'' to the smiling psychopaths in Quentin Tarantino's movies
_ and that such psycho clowns have become the ``crazy-funny''
mascots of ``our chaos culture, with its random acts of senseless
violence, its tabloid feeding frenzies, its mad bombers and
millenarian cults.''
</P>
<P>
   In another chapter, he contends that a growing fascination with
freaks _ evinced by daytime television talk shows, the Broadway
musical ``Side Show'' and the vogue for bodybuilding and
body-piercing _ signals ``a crisis in the dominant culture's
authority to decide who stands in the center and who sits on the
fringes'' while flouting ``the puritanical commandments'' of
William Bennett and his New Victorians.
</P>
<P>
   A similar defiance of the status quo, he suggests, can be found
in the adolescent bathroom humor of ``There's Something About
Mary,'' ``South Park'' and assorted Jim Carrey movies.
</P>
<P>
   Another recurrent theme in ``Insanitarium'' concerns the
body-loathing manifested by digerati, who believe that technology
can liberate the mind from the flesh and replace the real world
with a more perfect virtual realm. This is a view, Dery points out,
not so different from that shared by members of the Heaven's Gate
cult, who committed mass suicide in hopes of shedding their fleshy
vehicles and ascending to a higher level.
</P>
<P>
   Such thoughts on body-loathing were laid out with greater depth
and perspicuity by Dery in ``Escape Velocity.'' Indeed,
``Insanitarium'' often reads like a series of embroidery jobs
perfunctorily worked on that earlier volume.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, the chapters of ``Insanitarium'' do not even
form a coherent or cohesive book, but instead read like a series of
individual essays (many originally appeared in assorted magazines
and online publications in slightly different form), linked only by
repeated observations and motifs.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, an uninspiring performance by a writer capable of
considerably more incisive work.

`OFFICE SPACE': ONE BIG HAPPY FAMILY? NO, NOT AT THIS COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who has endured work as a low-level cog in a corporate
machine should appreciate the acute frustrations of the eager young
beavers who rebel against the system in Mike Judge's moderately
savvy satire ``Office Space.''
</P>
<P>
   The comedy, the first live-action feature directed by the
creator of ``Beavis and Butt-head'' and ``King of the Hill,''
distills the pettiness of office life in its sneakily savage
portrait of a quintessential middle-management boss named Bill
Lumbergh (Gary Cole).
</P>
<P>
   Puffed up with fake jocularity, Bill epitomizes the smiley,
buck-passing, back-stabbing, passive-aggressive office dictator who
fears and despises his underlings while prating nauseatingly about
everybody being one big happy family.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of that family's misery is amusingly revealed at
Bill's office birthday party, at which the employees stand around
scowling grimly as he cuts the cake and dispenses a cheer so
patently false it has a sadistic edge.
</P>
<P>
   The corporation in question is a high-tech outfit named Initech
whose role in the world of information is never specified. The
eager beavers who mount a personal insurrection are three computer
programmers: Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) and his cubicle
neighbors Samir (Ajay Naidu) and the unfortunately named Michael
Bolton (David Herman). Needless to say, the pop singer whose name
the character shares is the butt of much snide humor.
</P>
<P>
   The rebellion begins when Peter's yuppie girlfriend, a control
freak and therapy nut, drags him to a hypnotist to ``work'' on
their relationship. Just at the moment Peter has been eased into a
trance and told not to worry about anything, the therapist drops
dead of a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Permanently suspended in a state of happy nonchalance, Peter is
figuratively re-born as a carefree guy miraculously relieved of all
anxieties regarding work, money and love. He takes days off
whenever he feels like it and shows up at the office at odd hours,
sometimes overturning office furniture just for the fun of it.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed by a pair of consultants brought in to downsize the
company, he impresses them by gleefully confessing his own
uselessness instead of desperately trying to justify his job. His
candid sarcasm, of course, convinces them that he is definitely
upper-management material.
</P>
<P>
   But Peter has no interest in corporate advancement. With his two
cyberwise office mates, he concocts a nickel-and-dime computer
scheme to embezzle small sums of money from Initech that over time
should reap them a fortune without the losses ever being detected.
He also fearlessly pursues a pretty young waitress named Joanna
(Jennifer Aniston) whose boss is the fast-food restaurant
equivalent of Bill Lumbergh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Office Space'' is an expansion of three animated shorts
created by Judge for television over the last decade, and it has
the loose-jointed feel of a bunch of sketches packed together into
a narrative that doesn't gather much momentum. Its conspiratorial
eager beavers are so undeveloped that they could hardly even be
called types. You don't care for a second what happens to them.
</P>
<P>
   By far the richest characters are the genially evil Bill and a
stammering, paranoid, anal-retentive nebbish named Milton (Stephen
Root) who is tongue-tied in front of authority.
</P>
<P>
   We've all met someone like Milton. He is the sort of
eccentrically geeky petty grievance collector who in his heart
would declare war to keep possession of a purloined stapler but is
too intimidated to express himself. An obsessive-compulsive maniac,
Milton is also a ripe candidate for committing mass murder once the
injustices and indignities he has been collecting so assiduously
over the years reach full boil.
</P>
<P>
   In the unlikely event that ``Office Space'' spawns a sequel,
let's hope we see a lot more of Milton, who is the movie's only
inspired creation.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCTION NOTES &QL;

   ``Office Space'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying
parent or adult guardian). It includes some strong language.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You just learned you have high cholesterol. Your
doctor has told you that you're a high-risk candidate for heart
disease and you'd better reduce your fat intake _ starting today.
You want to get on the healthy-eating bandwagon. If you're clueless
about where to turn for help in incorporating changes into your
daily diet, don't despair.
</P>
<P>
   Pick up a copy of the recently released ``The New American Heart
Association Cookbook, Sixth Edition.'' It's brimming with
up-to-date information about cholesterol and heart disease and
offers user-friendly recipes. There's plenty to digest in this
698-page tome that celebrates the association's 25th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Vast changes in nutrition knowledge and scientific views have
occurred since the cookbook first came out 25 years ago. For
instance, back then, whole milk laden with fat was touted as good
for you, even though it may have raised blood cholesterol. Now
nonfat milk is recommended as a far better choice to keep fat in
check in the diet.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the book came out originally in 1973, we did not know the
entire story of the role diet played in cardiovascular disease,''
noted Jane Ruehl, managing editor of consumer publications for
American Heart Association in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, researchers were just beginning to establish the
cause-and-effect link between high fat consumption and high blood
cholesterol. Now we know beyond a shadow of a doubt that too much
dietary fat raises blood cholesterol. This is especially true of
saturated fat.''
</P>
<P>
   So the first and latest editions of the cookbooks differ in
several ways.
</P>
<P>
   Only calories per serving accompanied recipes in the first
edition; successive editions included more detailed nutritional
analysis and information as it became available. The latest edition
now includes amounts of total fat, saturated fat, polyunsaturated
fat, monounsaturated fat, protein, carbohydrates, cholesterol,
fiber and sodium per serving for all recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Another big difference relates to the amount of time consumers
spend in the kitchen cooking, noted Ruehl. Research has indicated
that people spent more time in the kitchen 25 years ago than today,
so the recent revision emphasizes recipes that are easier and
quicker to prepare _ with fewer ingredients, more convenience items
(garlic in a jar, canned broth, etc.) and faster and different
cooking methods (i.e. sauteing instead of roasting).
</P>
<P>
   More than 150 of the 600 recipes in the book are new, but many _
another 150 _ of those in older volumes have been retested, revised
and updated to incorporate the explosion of nonfat, low-fat,
low-salt, salt-free, convenience and newer and trendy ingredients
on the market today that were not available a couple of decades
ago. That includes items like nonfat flavored yogurts, nonfat and
low-fat cheeses and sour cream, portobello mushrooms, fresh ginger,
kiwis, balsamic vinegar and salt-free canned tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Also, about one-third of the new edition, which was three years
in the making, is devoted to quick and easy recipes designed to
inspire busy cooks who want to prepare recipes from scratch when
time is at a premium. But all of the recipes, even the lengthier,
more time-consuming ones, appear straightforward, uncomplicated and
accessible.
</P>
<P>
   Taste was a major emphasis in revamping the recipes and
developing new ones this time around. It is hoped that the recipes
will convince even skeptics that low-fat food can taste fantastic,
said Ruehl, dispelling the image of heart-healthy food as bland and
boring.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the book can deliver palatable, satisfying and flavorful
creations depends on individual tastes and recipe selections. The
Fudgy Buttermilk Brownies (made with unsweetened cocoa powder,
unsweetened applesauce, nonfat buttermilk, egg whites and vanilla)
were rubbery, lacking in chocolate flavor and uninspiring, while
Chocolate Swirl Cheesecake (a combination of fat-free and
reduced-fat cream cheese, nonfat sour cream, egg substitute,
unsweetened cocoa powder and fat-free caramel apple dip) was just
OK. Perhaps flavor could have been improved in both with a little
more fat and cocoa. But the Italian Rice Salad With Artichokes was
a winner.
</P>
<P>
   Cook's tips sprinkled throughout the book should be helpful to
novice cooks unfamiliar with items such as brown rice, lemon grass,
rice vinegar, hazelnuts, instant-read thermometers, and techniques
for cutting sticky foods (use kitchen shears lightly sprayed with
vegetable oil). Time-saving tips are another new feature giving
cooks options such as reducing the simmering time for a spaghetti
sauce from two hours to 30 minutes without much flavor loss.
Another tip suggests preparing more than a single recipe of chicken
so you end up with extra to use in another dish.
</P>
<P>
   In developing new recipes for this volume, testers were given
directives to use the lowest-fat ingredients that would yield the
desired results, said Ruehl. The association's staff scientists
reviewed each recipe. In some cases, testers had to return to the
kitchen to refine recipes and reduce the fat.
</P>
<P>
   Only you have the power to change your diet, reduce the amount
of fat it contains and eat healthfully. Perhaps some of these
recipes from the new cookbook may inspire you to get started
without sacrificing taste, convenience and pleasure. Give them a
whirl. &UR;

REDUCE FAT WHILE ADDING FLAVOR
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When it comes to heart-smart cooking and dining,
try some of these fat-cutting techniques and flavor-enhancing
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   _ Avoid cooking methods that add fat (such as deep-frying) or
allow food to cook in its own fat. Opt instead for roasting,
baking, broiling, braising, poaching, sauteing, stir-frying and
microwaving, which require little or no fat.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use nonstick skillets and nonstick vegetable oil sprays.
</P>
<P>
   _ Trim all fat from meat before cooking, except when roasting
(remove after roasting, prior to eating). Use ground beef, pork or
turkey that is no more than 15 percent fat. Drain off all fat after
browning meats. Brown ground meat without added ingredients, then
rinse with hot water and drain to get rid of as much of the fat as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use skinless chicken parts and remove all visible fat before
cooking. Roast a turkey or chicken with the skin on, but be sure to
remove it before eating.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stretch ground meats and poultry by using finely chopped
veggies. Reduce cholesterol by using less meats and poultry and
more vegetables in soups, salads and other recipes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cook vegetables just until crisp-tender for best flavor and
nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sweeten plain nonfat yogurt with pureed or cut-up fruits, or
undiluted orange or apple juice concentrate to save extra sugar
calories.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use fresh herbs and citrus peels _ and plenty of them _
wherever possible to make up for the flavor you'll be missing from
fat.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use dry mustard for a zesty flavoring in cooking, or mix it
with a little water to make a zippy condiment.
</P>
<P>
   _ Citrus juice and vinegar are excellent flavor enhancers on
fruits, vegetables, fish, chicken, etc.
</P>
<P>
   _ When you desire a burst of flavor, use dried fruits and
vegetables such as cherries, cranberries, tomatoes, mushrooms and
chili peppers, which are more intense than fresh.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use fats and oils sparingly and use those lowest in saturated
fatty acids and cholesterol. Also be aware that although coconut
oil, palm oil and palm kernel oil are vegetable oils and have no
cholesterol, they are high in saturated fatty acids.

BLACK HISTORY, SENIORS AND GETTING OVER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes a song gets grooved into your mind, forming a
soundtrack to whatever else you're thinking and doing.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes you hear it as low background music. Sometimes it
overrides all other thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   The recurrence can last for days.
</P>
<P>
   ``How I got over ... How I got over ...''
</P>
<P>
   For two days running, that gospel classic has been running
through my mind as though it's the only record on an old 78 rpm
phonograph that I can't turn off.
</P>
<P>
   That Mahalia Jackson standard has been echoing and re-echoing
inside my skull ever since I heard Dorethea Moore spellbind an
audience with it on Tuesday at the Fellowship Corner Senior
Citizens Center's Black Heritage program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as soon as I see Jesus,/the man who set me free/How he
bled and suffered/How he died for me ...''
</P>
<P>
   Moore sang without musical accompaniment. She didn't need it.
She sang from the depths of her feelings, from the breadth of her
experience, from the roots of her history, from the height of her
faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to thank him because he taught me./I want to thank him
because he brought me.''
</P>
<P>
   I was the guest speaker for the center's annual black history
program. But I know that I benefited more from being among the
seniors there than they gained from hearing my reflections on the
history of that unique amalgam of people referred to collectively
today as African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Looking out over the packed house at 1601 New York Ave. in Fort
Worth, I was intensely aware that I was addressing people who had
lived far more black history than I had known firsthand or had
studied. And I knew that I should really have been listening to
them instead of speaking to them.
</P>
<P>
   When I read them Sterling Brown's stirring poem about an old
woman's recollections of a race riot in Atlanta, the reactions from
some in the audience clearly indicated both firsthand knowledge of
similar episodes and a grasp of the broader themes of the poem,
which essentially amounts to a capsule of black history.
</P>
<P>
   It's the poem that ends with the race riot ending when all the
black people go home, oil their shotguns and sit on their front
porches. I related a similar episode that I heard had happened in
Fort Worth in which such a show of shotguns prevented a riot. And
some in the audience actually remembered the incident, which
occurred more than half a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Whether I was telling them something they already knew or
something they didn't, they encouraged me with their amens, their
mirth and their expressions of intense interest.
</P>
<P>
   It was both gratifying and humbling to look out over that
assembly of lively bodies and eager faces. There was so much
vitality _ so much more than I had expected to find at a senior
center.
</P>
<P>
   After all, most of the people there were old enough to have been
my father or mother. And I've been hounded by the AARP for more
than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, I thought, there is something going on at that center
and in their everyday lives that helps them get over.
</P>
<P>
   Or course, a whole lot of it is faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm gonna sing, hallelujah. Trouble's over ...''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the camaraderie has something to do with it. Part of
it, too, is just staying active. And it's a good bet that a
sustaining interest in keeping abreast of things and acquiring new
knowledge contributes to it.
</P>
<P>
   Their Black Heritage observance reflects that latter ingredient.
They clearly derived an enormous amount of pride and reinvigoration
from reflecting on how far they and their race have come.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the seniors were dressed in some form of African attire.
That would not have been so 20 years ago. And they looked good in
it.
</P>
<P>
   They formed a colorful and ornate crazy quilt of humanity, like
the quilts that black people used to make out of scraps of fabric _
quilts that inadvertently replicated African art forms _ motifs
quilted into the works of Picasso, Matisse and other modern
artists.
</P>
<P>
   I left the converted fire station that houses the senior center
renewed. I had caught their spirit of optimism and inquisitiveness.
Now, like Dorethea Moore ...
</P>
<P>
   ``My soul looks back and wonders how I got over.''

SHOPPING FOR A MORE HEALTHFUL LIFESTYLE

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There's no time like the present to examine and
change your eating habits to incorporate heart-healthy foods and
eating into your daily diet. Remember that healthy eating begins at
the supermarket _ with what you buy. These shopping tips may help
give you a boost.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Plan your meals for an entire week and make a detailed
shopping list accordingly to save time at the store and reduce
impulse buying. Keep in mind that variety is key to healthful
eating.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Concentrate on shopping the perimeters of the supermarket
where you'll find a wide variety of fruits and vegetables (which
have little or no fat and tend to be low in sodium and high in
fiber and vitamins) and lean meat, poultry and seafood choices.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Read labels carefully.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; When you see foods labeled fat-free, low-fat, low sodium and
the like, here's what they mean according to the Food and Drug
Administration-approved definitions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Fat-free &UR;  &LR; _ less than 0.5 grams of fat per serving.
</P>
<P>
   _ Low-fat &UR;  &LR;  _ no more than 3 grams of fat per serving.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lean (as applied to meats) &UR;  &LR;  _ less than 10 grams of total
fat, 4.5 grams of saturated fat and 95 milligrams of cholesterol
per serving.
</P>
<P>
   _ Extra lean (as applied to meats) &UR;  &LR;  _ less than 5 grams of fat,
2 grams of saturated fat and 95 milligrams of cholesterol per
serving.
</P>
<P>
   _ Light or lite &UR;  &LR;  _ one-third fewer calories or no more than
half the fat of the regular version.
</P>
<P>
   _ Low sodium &UR;  &LR;  _ no more than half the sodium of the regular
version.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sodium-free &UR;  &LR;  _ contains less than 5 milligrams of sodium per
serving.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cholesterol-free &UR;  &LR; _ less than 2 milligrams of cholesterol and
2 grams or less of saturated fat per serving.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Get in the habit of using fat-free or low-fat dairy
products. Opt for nonfat milk, low-fat or nonfat sour cream, cream
cheese and cottage cheese and reduced fat cheeses instead of their
higher fat counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Purchase lean beef cuts _ either USDA Select or Choice
grades _ such as round steak, tenderloin or flank steak _ rather
than more fatty ones such as T-bones or rib eyes, which are higher
in saturated fats.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Choose lean or extra-lean ground beef, and buy turkey or
chicken ground without the skin.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; When shopping, keep in mind that skinless white chicken meat
has half the fat of skinless dark meat. Much of the fat in poultry
is in the skin, so if the poultry you purchase has skin, be sure to
remove it before cooking or eating.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Fresh fish is low in sodium and generally contains less
saturated fat than red meat and about the same cholesterol (shrimp
and crayfish are higher). In general, the whiter the fish, the
lower the fat content.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Avoid hidden salt _ in additives like sodium nitrite, sodium
benzoate, sodium propionate and sodium citrate _ which comes in
many processed foods.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Look for canned or dehydrated varieties of soup with no more
than 2 grams of fat per cup.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; For snacks, look for baked tortilla chips with only a small
amount of fat, or eat pretzels that are fat free.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Select nonfat or low-fat dairy desserts, including frozen
and nonfrozen yogurt, ice cream, ice milk and sherbet.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Polyunsaturated and monounsaturated oils are the kinds of
fat you'll want to include in your daily diet to keep your blood
cholesterol low. According to the AHA, a reasonable total to aim
for is 5 to 8 teaspoons of fat daily, and that includes hidden fat
in baked and snack foods as well as cooking and as spreads.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Use safflower, sunflower, corn, soybean, olive or canola oil
as your primary vegetable oil as they are low in saturated fatty
acids and can help lower cholesterol as part of a diet low in
saturated fatty acids.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; If you are trying to reduce salt in your diet, be aware that
seasonings, condiments and sauces such as steak sauce, ketchup,
MSG, soy sauce, bouillon cubes and salad dressings may contain a
lot of sodium. Look for low-sodium versions.

THE RIGHT STUFF, IF YOU LIKE SWEETNESS AND OPTIMISM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There seems to be a whole new strain of movie in theaters these
days: films without subtext. ``She's All That'' _ the Pygmalion
story as staged for UPN _ is right on the nose, all right in front
of you, crushing nuance and resonance as flat as a Gallo brothers
grape. And ``October Sky,'' the film adaptation of Homer Hickam
Jr.'s memoir ``Rocket Boys,'' is the melodramatic version of this
What You See Is What You Get school of filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   A sweet and wholly predictable chunk of storytelling that whips
itself into a frenzy whenever the biggest, most obvious moments are
on the horizon, ``October Sky'' _ it refers to the time of year
when the Russian Sputnik satellite was launched in 1957 _ follows
the rapt young Homer (Jake Gyllenhaal), a teen-ager fascinated by
the infant space race.
</P>
<P>
   In Coalwood, the small West Virginia mining town where Homer
lives, Sputnik slices across the sky and changes his life. From
that night forward, Homer knuckles down and decides to apply
himself to doing exactly the same thing: seeing his own rocket burn
through the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   To realize his dream, Homer falls in with the class nerd (Chris
Owen, much better used here than he was in ``She's All That''), who
offers a scientific grounding to Homer's aspirations. Before long,
``October Sky'' smoothly melts into If You Launch It, They Will
Come. Homer and his pals build and fire off a series of rockets,
which fail in spectacular ways, and soon the entire town is on
their side. Especially their teacher (Laura Dern, head held high
and teeth gleaming with pride), who pushes them on even after the
principal seeks to muscle the boys into a less lofty hobby _ and
future.
</P>
<P>
   The inspirational element is crucial to ``October Sky.'' It's
something that director Joe Johnston has been moving toward _ the
next logical step after ``Jumanji,'' a raucous fable tinged with
regret. With ``October Sky,'' Johnston and screenwriter Lewis
Colick have built the story around Homer and his no-nonsense
father, the earthbound John, played by Chris Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   It's Cooper, giving the first great performance in a movie this
year, who provides solidity and balance to all of the pounding
waves of go-for-it attitude here. His authority and commitment _
John is never irascible or bluff _ add sinew and sweat to what is a
slightly unbelievable character; there's not a cheap gesture in his
entire performance. This movie is luckier than it deserves, with
such meticulously observed acting.
</P>
<P>
   Even though ``October Sky'' is based on a true story, and
Hickam's book isn't much more complicated than the movie, the movie
feels unreal. In the '50s, with paranoia over the Soviets and
excitement about the mostly unknown bounds of space at their
heights _ remember, Pluto was still a planet in those days _ you'd
think that all of Coalwood would be behind Homer and his friends.
</P>
<P>
   This material could be played as a sprawling, all-American
comedy, with the wide-eyed ingenuity of the kids appalling and
surprising everyone. But the '50s are seen through that patina of
affection that has come to symbolize the past in movies, and most
of the people are benign and well-meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``October Sky'' is an astonishing combination of brazen
sentimentality and solid craftsmanship. (The cold, oppressive
lighting of the scenes in the coal mines says as much as any of the
on-the-nose dialogue, and far more eloquently.) It'll be a hit,
because it's so relentless in its clear-skinned optimism, and it's
very well put together. (Natalie Canerday, as Homer's mother, is
also quite good.) With a subject this good _ and from real life _
we want it to be more thoughtfully dramatized.

HEALTHY ADULTS, TAKE HEART
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
  
By NATALIE HAUGHTON 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Since 1983, the American Heart Association has
recommended the same type of diet for all healthy adults. High
blood cholesterol, high blood pressure and obesity (major risk
factors for heart disease) aren't something you should start
thinking about in your 40s or 50s. The time to start is now.
Following are the AHA's dietary recommendations to reduce the risk
of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Limit total fat consumption to no more than 30 percent of
total calories. That means if you're on a 1,200-calorie-a-day diet,
you should consume no more than 40 grams of fat per day; an
1,800-calorie diet no more than 50 grams fat daily.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Saturated fat consumption should be 8 to 10 percent of total
calories. Limit polyunsaturated fats (corn oil, sunflower oil,
etc.) to no more than 10 percent of total calories. Monounsaturated
fats (canola oil, olive oil, etc.) should be no more than 15
percent of total calories.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Restrict dietary cholesterol intake to less than 300
milligrams per day.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Fiber from food should be 25 to 30 grams per day.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Limit sodium intake to 2,400 milligrams (2.4 grams) per day.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the entire day or week, not each serving of a specific
dish. It's the total overall picture that is important. At times
you may eat some foods such as olive oil, which derive 100 percent
of their calories from fat, while other foods you eat, such as
apples, may contain no fat calories. The key is to balance high-fat
and low- or nonfat foods.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the AHA suggests eating a wide variety of foods,
including plenty of vegetables, fruits and whole grains, using
sugar and drinking alcohol in moderation and balancing food intake
with physical activity to prevent obesity.
</P>
<P>
   To help you visualize what you need for good nutrition daily,
refer to the AHA's Healthy Heart Food Pyramid. More tips are
available in ``An Eating Plan for Healthy Americans,'' ``Tips for
Eating Out'' and ``How You Can Have Your Cake and Eat It Too.'' For
free copies of the brochures, call the American Heart Association
at (800) 242-8721. &UR;

   TINKY WINKY GETS ALL THE INK, BUT `DIPSY' REFLECTS A DEEPER
ISSUE
</P>
<P>
   Teletubbyland, which we've all been reading about lately, is an
inclusive and pluralistic place. The Rev. Jerry Falwell failed to
mention that Dipsy, one of Tinky Winky's friends, is a Teletubby of
color. As the Teletubbies love and accept Tinky Winky without
reference to his orientation (and questionable taste in handbags),
they also love and accept Dipsy without reference to his darker
skin.
</P>
<P>
   But for many children, loving and accepting Dipsy may be a more
difficult and important task than determining Tinky Winky's
ambiguous sexuality. (Slugged TELETUBBY-THEOLOGY. 850 words)
</P>
<P>
   MID-LIFE SPIRITUALITY SHUNS `QUESTION-AND-ANSWER' RELIGION
</P>
<P>
   The spirituality of growing up and being grown-up is not the
same. Youthful spirituality seeks answers for big questions: Who is
God? Who am I? Who will be my life partner? What am I to do in the
world? A quest for order engulfs the young as they become
independent persons. As a result, religions with strict moral
boundaries and clear-cut beliefs appeal to teen-agers and young
adults, providing direction to those otherwise adrift.
</P>
<P>
   By forty, spirituality is no longer about order. Rather, it is
about meaning. For most of us, those ``big questions'' have been
resolved. As the last baby-boomers turn forty, an entire generation
is moving away from question-and-answer religion to narrative faith
-- a shift likely to produce profound consequences for America's
religious institutions and political landscape. (Slugged

`THE APPLE': DAUGHTERS OF DARKNESS WHO DREAM OF THE LIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Apple'' was shown as part of last year's New York Film
Festival. Following are excerpts from Lawrence Van Gelder's review,
which appeared in The New York Times on Sept. 30. The film opens
Friday in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Potent symbolism linked to a bizarre story rooted in fact, set
in Iran and laden with political, social and generational overtones
makes ``The Apple'' one of the more intriguingly resonant features
of the 36th New York Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   This Iranian-French co-production about a repressive father and
his daughters is the work of Samira Makhmalbaf, 17, the daughter of
the Iranian filmmaker Mohsen Makhmalbaf, whose artful ``Gabbeh''
made a striking impression at the festival in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Released as Iran is torn between the isolationism of religious
fundamentalists and efforts to open the nation to the world, ``The
Apple'' re- enacts the story of an uneducated, unemployed,
impoverished 65-year-old man with a blind wife; he kept his two
daughters locked behind walls and bars for all of their 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Understood on one level as an argument against the old ways and
the repression of women or on another as a plea for greater
national freedom, ``The Apple'' possesses a significance beyond the
simple outlines of its story.
</P>
<P>
   These children can barely communicate, possess no skills and
know nothing of the world outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``They must have a future, a role in society,'' says the female
social worker who responds to a petition by neighbors for urgent
action.
</P>
<P>
   In answer to the complaints, the father insists that he has been
slandered and dishonored, especially when the story makes
headlines. ``It's all lies,'' he says, making an assortment of
excuses: his wife's blindness and his need to earn a living; the
possibility that neighboring boys could defile the girls and
dishonor him.
</P>
<P>
   The social worker extracts a promise that the father will free
them. When he reneges, she returns, sets the girls loose and locks
the father in his house. But she arms him with a hacksaw and tells
him that unless he cuts through the bars or breaks the lock, the
girls will be taken away.
</P>
<P>
   As for the girls, their greatest dream is to possess an apple,
and in their journey outside home, they _ and eventually their
mother _ meet a small boy who tantalizes them with an apple laden
with symbolism that he dangles on a string from the end of a stick
just beyond their reach.
</P>
<P>
   Working from a screenplay by her father and using the actual
family involved in this case, Ms. Makhmalbaf elicits remarkably
unaffected performances. If there is a certain repetitiousness in
the early part of this account, there is also much natural humor
and keen observation of the behavior of children once the girls
begin to venture into the world.

   TINKY WINKY GETS ALL THE INK, BUT `DIPSY' REFLECTS A DEEPER
ISSUE
</P>
<P>
   Teletubbyland, which we've all been reading about lately, is an
inclusive and pluralistic place. The Rev. Jerry Falwell failed to
mention that Dipsy, one of Tinky Winky's friends, is a Teletubby of
color. As the Teletubbies love and accept Tinky Winky without
reference to his orientation (and questionable taste in handbags),
they also love and accept Dipsy without reference to his darker
skin.
</P>
<P>
   But for many children, loving and accepting Dipsy may be a more
difficult and important task than determining Tinky Winky's
ambiguous sexuality. (Slugged TELETUBBY-THEOLOGY. 850 words)

   MID-LIFE SPIRITUALITY SHUNS `QUESTION-AND-ANSWER' RELIGION
</P>
<P>
   The spirituality of growing up and being grown-up is not the
same. Youthful spirituality seeks answers for big questions: Who is
God? Who am I? Who will be my life partner? What am I to do in the
world? A quest for order engulfs the young as they become
independent persons. As a result, religions with strict moral
boundaries and clear-cut beliefs appeal to teen-agers and young
adults, providing direction to those otherwise adrift.
</P>
<P>
   By forty, spirituality is no longer about order. Rather, it is
about meaning. For most of us, those ``big questions'' have been
resolved. As the last baby-boomers turn forty, an entire generation
is moving away from question-and-answer religion to narrative faith
-- a shift likely to produce profound consequences for America's
religious institutions and political landscape. (Slugged

 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    On CNN last weekend, the Rev. Jerry Falwell issued an unusual
denial. He claimed that another author had written the
controversial ``Tinky Winky'' piece appearing in one of his
newsletters.
 &HT;    Seems Falwell had never seen a Teletubby -- much less concluding
that one was gay.
 &HT;    The editorial previously attributed to Falwell had ``outed''
Tinky Winky of the PBS children's show, ``Teletubbies.'' The writer
claimed that since Tinky Winky was purple, has an antenna shaped
like an inverted triangle, carries a purse, and sometimes wears a
skirt, he must be gay.
 &HT;    The article further warned parents that ``Teletubbies'' could
undermine the morals of American children by desensitizing them to
the dangers of homosexuality.
 &HT;    As parents of a 1-year-old, my husband and I are avid
Teletubbies fans. Long before Jerry Falwell noticed -- or did not
notice, as he now claims -- we suspected Tinky Winky might be gay.
And we were not the first. Tinky Winky's British fans turned him
into a gay-rights icon months before the show ever aired in the
United States. In the wake of the Falwell-Tinky Winky affair, one
gay activist group invited the Teletubbies to be the marshal at
their annual parade.
 &HT;    In this case liberal parents, gay-rights groups and Jerry
Falwell agree: Tinky-Winky bends gender.
 &HT;    If Falwell considers this further, he might object to Teletubby
theology. There are only four Teletubbies and the other three are
straight. Therefore, Tinky Winky must have been born ``that way.''
In Teletubbyland, homosexuality is nature, not nurture.
 &HT;    Is Tinky Winky dangerous? He does not recruit other Teletubbies
and he appears to be celibate (although Teletubbies do bathe
together and sleep in the same room). The other Teletubbies love
him and he loves them -- platonically.
 &HT;    The danger, it appears, is that Teletubbies love Tinky Winky
without reference to his sexual orientation. If Tinky Winky was
born gay, then the Christian response is to love and accept him
just as good Teletubbies all love and accept each other.
Teletubbies thus undermine pre-schooler morality -- by teaching
toddlers to love others.
 &HT;    Teletubbyland is an inclusive and pluralistic place. Falwell
failed to mention that Dipsy, one of Tinky Winky's friends, is a
Teletubby of color. As the Teletubbies love and accept Tinky Winky
without reference to his orientation (and questionable taste in
handbags), they also love and accept Dipsy without reference to his
darker skin.
 &HT;    For many children, loving and accepting Dipsy may be a more
difficult and important task than determining Tinky Winky's
ambiguous sexuality. A young friend confided to me that her best
friend ``didn't like Dipsy.'' When I asked why, she reluctantly
confessed, ``Because he doesn't look right.'' Recently, when my
very blond, blue-eyed daughter carried Dipsy through an airport,
two African-American women asked to see him, commenting ``how
cute'' he was.
 &HT;    While the Tinky Winky controversy reveals some interesting
dynamics of the current argument in American churches regarding
sexuality, it also obscures the deeper issue of racial prejudice in
those churches. Some people -- like Jerry Falwell -- willingly
display homophobia in public. Yet many of the same people resist
the idea they may be racist. In 1999, most Christians would never
dream of attacking Dipsy as ``dangerous.'' Forty years ago,
however, their grandparents did.
 &HT;    In American churches, racism is a deeply embedded prejudice. It
is harder to address and often more difficult to discern. It is an
underground evil, poisoning much of our national life with little
notice. Even in this still-puritanical nation, we would rather
discuss sex than race in public.
 &HT;    Gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals should take heart -- the
prejudice against them is ``out.'' When one knows the enemy, the
battle is easier. But in the war against racism, the enemy is still
within. And facile political correctness has closeted racism even
deeper in our souls.
 &HT;    When it comes to Teletubbies, Dipsy is the quieter -- and almost
invisible -- Teletubby. Last Christmas, boxed Dipsies still lined
the shelves at my neighborhood store. Po, Laa-Laa, and Tinky Winky
all sold out.
 &HT;    Perhaps Dipsy witnesses to the real danger in American society
-- our silent prejudices. When my little daughter kisses Dipsy, I
envy her. I wish I had grown up in a world where white girls loved
dark-skinned dolls without hesitation. To her, Dipsy is just one
more cherished Teletubby. I hope and pray it will always be that
way.
 &HT;    If Tinky Winky's over-the-top stereotype undermines a
``morality'' of prejudice against gays and lesbians, more power to
him. In Teletubbyland all our prejudices -- overt and covert -- are
thankfully undermined.

 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Long before the Y2K computer glitch, 1999 filled me with fear.
On New Year's 1969, my mother commented, ``Imagine that: thirty
years from now you'll celebrate a new millennium and your fortieth
birthday.''
 &HT;    At ten years old, both sounded apocalyptic. I convinced myself
neither would ever arrive.
 &HT;    The long-dreaded day has come. This month, I turn forty.
 &HT;    Forty? The ``old age of youth and the youth of old age'' is upon
me. Friends who have already passed the mid-life milestone grin
knowingly, ``It's tough. You'll see.''
 &HT;    They are right. Over the last months, a gnawing sense of
mortality keeps me awake nights. My career dissatisfies me. I am
trying to eat better and work out. I even want to buy a
convertible.
 &HT;    A by-the-numbers mid-life crisis.
 &HT;    Recently, I saw a book about spirituality for life's ``second
half.'' Thumbing through the pages, the prospect of the ``second
half'' irritated. Not for me, I mused. I am still young. After all,
I just had a baby.
 &HT;    In many ways, forty is young -- especially now as people live
longer. However, as the distance between my students and me
increases, I know that forty is not youthful. That twenty-year gap
constantly reminds me that I'm not of their generation. They are
growing up; I already have.
 &HT;    The spirituality of growing up and being grown-up is not the
same. Youthful spirituality seeks answers for big questions: Who is
God? Who am I? Who will be my life partner? What am I to do in the
world?
 &HT;    A quest for order engulfs the young as they become independent
persons. As a result, religions with strict moral boundaries and
clear-cut beliefs appeal to teen-agers and young adults, providing
direction to those otherwise adrift.
 &HT;    By forty, spirituality is no longer about order. Rather, it is
about meaning. For most of us, those ``big questions'' have been
resolved. There may or may not be a God. I may or may not ever
figure out who I am. Partners may or may not be for life. My career
may or may not provide meaning or fulfillment. The twenty years
between college and mid-life reveal the messiness of life -- very
little is as we expected it to be. Is there any meaning in the
mess?
 &HT;    Mid-life spirituality seeks to make sense of messiness. There
will always questions. Instead of answers, faith turns to finding
meaning through telling stories. Through story, patterns emerge
that give form to the chaos of adulthood.
 &HT;    Story-telling is an ancient -- and profoundly human -- way of
expressing faith. Every culture told stories of creation,
recreation, and death. A tribe's self-understanding and explanation
of God came from campfire tales -- and were eventually gathered
into sacred books and systematic theologies.
 &HT;    Sadly, in America, we treat the dominant religious book -- the
Bible -- as an answer book. This is an adolescent approach to the
text. The Bible is primarily a storybook -- tales whose collective
narrative shapes us spiritually. Its main story-line is that of a
God who creates and loves a people who, in turn, love God and serve
the world.
 &HT;    This story provides meaning for generations of Jews, Christians
and Muslims. Anyone who has spent time in its pages knows the Book
is riddled with ambiguity and paradox. Even it provides no
clear-cut answers. If so, how could there be so many conflicting
interpretations of its message? The Bible is, after all, a
collection of stories. And story must be experienced as living text
-- not simply memorized as a cheat sheet for God's final exam.
 &HT;    At forty, I find myself living in multiple stories: my own
story, my family's story, my church's story, history's story, and
biblical story. Meaning is multi-layered; truth is textured. Life
experience enriches each interpretation as stories are told and
retold. In the process, both humanity and divinity speak.
 &HT;    Perhaps story-telling as adult spirituality accounts for the
current popularity of spiritual autobiographies. As the last
baby-boomers turn forty, an entire generation is moving away from
question-and-answer religion to narrative faith -- a shift likely
to produce profound consequences for America's religious
institutions and political landscape. We should expect a higher
degree of religious and moral flexibility with an aging population
-- as already evinced by the Clinton scandal.
 &HT;    Life is messy and that's okay. Our stories tell us so.
 &HT;    Contemplating the years ahead, I may never be rich enough to buy
that red Mercedes convertible. But I trust the story will become
richer. Looking back on life's narrative seems fundamentally more
satisfying than finding the answers -- and even makes the prospect
of 2029 interesting rather than fearful.
 &HT;    Imagine that: my daughter will be thirty!

WHEN YOU GO: LAKE CONSTANCE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When to go: Summer is the peak tourism season, but spring and
fall are recommended. July and August can be hot, and even the best
hotels are usually not air-conditioned. Boat service is curtailed
during the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Getting there: Zurich, Switzerland, is the closest gateway for
international flight arrivals; it's about a one-hour drive from the
lake, and frequent rail connections are available. Munich, Germany,
is about 110 miles to the northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Getting around: Boats provide the best perspective and access.
From mid-May to mid-October, services operate east-west along the
northern and southern shores. Passenger-car ferries cross
north-south year-round between Friedrichshafen, Germany, and
Romanshorn, Switzerland. Fares are economical (about $8-$25,
depending on the route), and Bodensee passes are available that
allow unlimited travel (and stops) during a specified time period.
</P>
<P>
   Holders of some rail passes get discounts of up to 50 percent on
boat passes. Call Rail Europe at 800-438-7245. Many cities along
the lake are served by passenger rail.
</P>
<P>
   Crossing borders: Cooperation by nations bordering the lake
ensures that procedures are uncomplicated. But a passport is
essential. And you'll need the currency of each nation you visit.
German is spoken throughout the area; tourism offices in the
largest cities have English-speaking staff members, but English
isn't widely used.
</P>
<P>
   Lodging: The Steigenberger Inselhotel in Constance is ideally
situated beside the lake and within walking distance of boat
departures and most major sites. Write to Steigenberger Inselhotel,
Auf der Insel 1, 78462 Konstanz, Germany. Or a travel agent can
provide details and offer recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Other enticements: Almost every village along or near the lake
has its appeal. The German island of Reichenau, west of Constance,
contains notable examples of Roman architecture. The Ren-
aissance-style buildings in Wasserburg (also in Germany, near
Lindau) are much-photographed. Romanshorn (in Switzerland, along
the south shore) boasts a beautiful harbor and lakeside parks and
trails. An English-language guide, available in many stores, is
helpful.

 &HT;    GOP'S BIG TAX-CUT PLAN WILL BE SCALED BACK
 &HT;    With TAX-DATA. For release Sunday, Feb. 21.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress might pass federal tax cuts this year, but
few believe they'll be as big or broad as those proposed by
Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Across-the-board cuts of 10 percent in income tax rates are at
the heart of the GOP leaders' agenda for this year. Those cuts
would save taxpayers up to $350 billion over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, many Republicans are ignoring that approach and
discussing what kind of smaller, targeted cuts _ such as tax relief
for married couples _ could be crammed into a more modest package
costing $150 billion or less.
</P>
<P>
   Most Republicans still like the big tax-cut package. But their
desire to make an all-out fight for it this year dwindled amid
Democratic attacks on its fairness and a lack of intense public
demand for big tax cuts. Many Republicans also realized that the
deepest cuts couldn't take effect until long after the next
election.
</P>
<P>
   With narrow margins of control in the House and the Senate, many
Republicans decided to settle for less ambitious tax cuts that
would have a better chance of getting enough Democratic support to
pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have to be more cautious than to give 10 percent or
some arbitrary notion across the board,'' said Rep. Mark Foley,
R-Fla., who said voters told him they would rather pay down the
debt than get a tax break.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The party's coming closer to agreement on a more
modest bill (that) doesn't assume that happy days are here again
forever and the bad times will never return.''
</P>
<P>
   In talks in the past week with his constituents, Rep. Bob
Wexler, D-Fla., ``definitely didn't detect an urgency or ground
swell of people seeking 10 percent tax cuts,'' said Eric Johnson,
Wexler's deputy chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coalition on across-the-board tax cuts is starting to
unravel again with this piecemeal approach,'' lamented spokesman
Pete Sepp of the National Taxpayers Union, which favors deep cuts
in tax rates. As Republicans argue with each other about what
should be in the smaller package, ``they're back to washing their
dirty laundry in public,'' Sepp said.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel J. Mitchell, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage
Foundation, was more optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a delightful problem _ to debate how to cut taxes, rather
than how to raise taxes,'' Mitchell said. ``There is no question
that across-the-board rate reductions are the most pro-growth way
of cutting taxes, but I'd be delighted if at the end of the year
they do either one.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., continued to insist
last week that Republicans want to cut tax rates by 10 percent. But
after headlining a GOP-sponsored ``Tax Cuts for Everyone'' rally in
Warren, Mich., he signaled some flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not locked into only this number and that number. Maybe it
should be 8.7 percent, and take the other part and do something
else with it,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was preaching to the faithful and can say anything he
wants,'' said Clint Stretch in the Washington office of Deloitte
and Touche, the U.S. branch of a global accounting firm that serves
business clients in every state.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when he comes back to Washington, the question becomes
whether Republicans in the House can agree on one idea, and if they
do, could they get the Senate to agree on it, and the president to
sign it,'' Stretch said. ``Unless something changes, I would say
this year's effort to do hundreds of billions of dollars (in tax
cuts) over a five-year range ends in a train wreck.''
</P>
<P>
   The wreck is likely because President Clinton ``put a dead cow
on the tracks,'' joked policy analyst Isabel Sawhill at the
nonpartisan Brookings Institution. Clinton said he wouldn't sign
any tax-cut bill until a bipartisan plan has been reached that
would keep the Social Security system solvent for the next 75
years.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders have already agreed in principle to Clinton's
proposal to shore up Social Security by using 62 percent of future
budget surpluses to pay down the public debts run up during the
deficit years. That would close roughly half of the Social Security
system's fiscal shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP's planned across-the-board tax cuts would use up the
other 38 percent of future surpluses. But some of that money might
be needed instead to meet the other half of Social Security's
financial needs.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Clinton proposed using that 38 percent for other
purposes, such as shoring up Medicare, funding increases in defense
and domestic programs, and using tax credits to subsidize
retirement accounts for low-income working people. He also proposed
$33 billion to finance three dozen targeted tax cuts, but they
would be paid for by raising other fees and taxes, rather than by
using the surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   Among the alternatives to the leadership's $350 billion tax
plan, the one with the most open support in GOP ranks was proposed
by Rep. Jerry Weller, R-Ill., and co-sponsored by 209 other
Republicans and 14 Democrats in the House. A similar bill
introduced by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, has been
co-sponsored by 16 Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Their approach would virtually eliminate the ``marriage
penalty,'' tax laws that cause a married couple to pay higher taxes
than two single people with the same income. Over five years,
Weller's plan would reduce tax bills by $150 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Even less expensive to the government is a $100 billion plan
announced this month by Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., and endorsed
by 17 other Republicans. Their approach would eliminate the
marriage penalty for couples in the 15 percent tax bracket and ease
it for some couples in higher tax brackets. It would also eliminate
the alternative minimum tax calculations that plague many
middle-class taxpayers, and would tack on some small, targeted tax
cuts as well.
</P>

   ``The 10 percent across-the-board cuts are a non-starter,'' said
Rep. Robert Matsui , D-Calif. , the second-ranking Democrat on the
tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats are pretty uniform on backing the president's
insistence that we move first on Social Security before we do tax
cuts of any manner,'' Matsui said. ``If we finally do get to tax
cuts, I think most Democrats would settle for a combination of the
president's targeted tax cuts and something like Congresswoman
Johnson's approach.''

BRAND EXPERT REVEALS STRATEGIES FOR MAKING PRODUCT A HOUSEHOLD
WORD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Teresa McUsic 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Hello, Coca-Cola!''
</P>
<P>
   You have just read the two most recognized words in the world.
If that thought frightens you, take solace in the fact that Coke is
the second-most-recognized global word.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is little doubt about the power of a brand name.
And one of the masters of the marketing universe, Frank Delano,
discusses brand naming in his new book ``The OmniPowerful Brand:
America's No. 1 Brand Specialist Shares His Secrets for Catapulting
Your Brand to Global Marketing Stardom'' (Amacom, 272 pages,
$27.95).
</P>
<P>
   The title alone says most of what you need in deciding whether
to buy the book. But what else should you expect from a brand name
specialist? Delano is head of a brand image firm responsible for
such names as Nissan's Pathfinder sport-utility vehicle, the Zoloft
antidepressant drug and Polaroid's Captiva camera.
</P>
<P>
   The book includes the runner-up names of the products that
Delano and his staff worked with, some of them still available. But
you better act quickly. A record 188,080 trademark applications
were filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in 1997. By
2001, the number of names filed is expected to soar to more than
400,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The brand name is no longer just a `silent salesperson' that
appears on the product or the product's packaging,'' Delano writes.
``... The brand will be the name of the game far into the 21st
century.'' After all, corporate raiders since the 1970s have
focused on brands as being the real value at most companies, Delano
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the targeted company's manufacturing plants, R&AMP;D
centers, sales force, distribution networks, management talent, or
patents on new technology _ it was the company's globally
recognized brands,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   Finding that superstar name isn't just a matter of employees
brainstorming around the conference table, however, Delano says.
First, names have to be thoroughly researched to determine whether
they are being used legally or have been dumped historically. Brand
names also have to push the buttons of the targeted consumer group
and must reflect the differences between this product and its
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than pay Delano upward of six figures to develop a name
for your company, you instead can employ seven principles and a
process that he describes for finding a great brand name. Those
include:
</P>
<P>
   [s] Capturing the product's essence, uniqueness or spirit.
</P>
<P>
   [s] Winning the consumers' attention by inspiring their
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   [s] Making sure the sound of the name is appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   [s] Making it simple.
</P>
<P>
   [s] Making it unforgettable with a visual image and sound.
</P>
<P>
   [s] Making the name's sexual image profile fit the product.
</P>
<P>
   [s] Making a believable claim for what the product can deliver.
</P>
<P>
   Using a large number of anecdotes from his own business and the
trade, Delano illustrates these points and more in a book that not
only informs but entertains.
</P>
<P>
   The second half of ``The OmniPowerful Brand'' discusses Delano's
concept of the brand name that does far more for your company than
just identify a product _ ``a brand that transcends the very
product that put it on the map.'' Package design, secondary
products, slogans, advertising, Web sites and alliances with other
powerful brand names all come into play.
</P>
<P>
   Supernames will become much more than their products in the next
century, Delano writes.
</P>
<P>
   The objective is ``to give the brand a free agent status, or the
ability to endorse a wide range of consumer products,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   Examples include Coca-Cola, Mickey Mouse and Martha Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Delano's book is thought-provoking and provides insightful
consulting for much less than his usual fees.

   ``The 401(k) Millionaire''
</P>
<P>
   By Knute Iwaszko
</P>
<P>
   Villard, $19.95
</P>
<P>
   Mostly a primer on personal finance, this book also includes
information on the tax-deferred savings vehicle known as the
401(k). Don't look for too much real insight, though. It mostly
states the obvious tips on how to make money; for example, put the
maximum you can into your 401(k) every year to match company
contributions and lower your tax liability.

   ``HeteroPhobia: Sexual Harassment and the Future of Feminism''
</P>
<P>
   By Daphne Patai

<P>
   Rowman &AMP; Littlefield, $24.95
</P>
<P>
   Have sexual harassment laws for the workplace gone too far?
Self-proclaimed feminist and academic Daphne Patai fears that they
have, and that they will sanitize all relationships and provide a
powerful weapon that women can use against men. She also discusses
what she characterizes as the sexual harassment industry: lawyers
and experts who are turning the law into money. An interesting look
at a controversial topic.

</P>
<P>

DESEGREGATION DEAL WILL HIT BLACKS, HISPANICS HARDEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIAN GUTHRIE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A legal settlement that jettisons the federal
desegregation formula governing the city's public schools will have
the most immediate impact on Hispanic and black children who were
readily enrolled in the schools of their choice because of race.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, reached Wednesday, gives the district until next
October to devise a new admissions policy that will maintain
integration without using race. The district is expected, at that
time, to dramatically reshuffle where students attend school.
</P>
<P>
   ``For now, it's African-American and Latino parents who will not
get the priority consideration they had in previous years,'' said
Assistant Superintendent Anthony Anderson, who oversees the
district's integration department. ``For any other ethnic group,
the factors are constant.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlement comes five years after several Chinese-American
families filed a class-action lawsuit against the district,
alleging that the race-based admissions policy denied them the
equal opportunity to attend the schools of their choice, including
San Francisco's elite Lowell High.
</P>
<P>
   It brings to an end the race-conscious policies created in 1983
as part of a plan to improve educational opportunities for black
and Hispanic students.
</P>
<P>
   While the district is ordered to delete race as a factor in
admissions, enrollment priorities will still be given to students
with brothers or sisters enrolled at a given school; children who
qualify for free or reduced-price lunches; and students living in
subsidized public housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate the district will no longer have this one
tool to help black and Latino children,'' said Michael Harris, a
lawyer for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People, a defendant in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear from all the information the district makes public
that those are the groups of students the district is doing the
worst job with,'' Harris said. ``The district clearly needs to
still take extra steps to help those groups do better.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1983 desegregation system, students were divided into
nine ethnic groups and enrollment was restricted at each school to
no more than 45 percent of any one group. At least four ethnic
groups had to be represented at each school.
</P>
<P>
   Without such racial engineering, schools will swiftly become
less diverse. There already are 27 schools in the district where
one ethnic group comprises more than 45 percent of the student
population.
</P>
<P>
   At top-ranked Lowell High, Chinese-Americans comprise 43 percent
of the student population. Without considering race as a factor in
admission, the school will easily become predominantly
Asian-American.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know exactly what this means for students who applied
to Lowell this year,'' said Marsha Cohen, chairwomen of Lowell's
admissions committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, blacks and Latinos got in if they were in the
range of being qualified. Now, those kids _ it appears _ won't get
in,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen percent of the students in the San Francisco public
schools are black; at Lowell, 4 percent are black. Hispanics
comprise 21 percent of the district's students and 11 percent of
the students at Lowell. There are 62,000 students in the district.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of blacks and Hispanics admitted to Lowell as
freshmen in 1998 would not have been admitted on test scores and
grades alone. They got there through ``value-added diversity
points,'' including race and economic status.
</P>
<P>
   The Lowell admissions committee has scheduled a meeting next
week to debate and determine the enrollment process based on the
settlement, Cohen said.

`OCTOBER SKY:' MOVING UP IN THE WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: W.Va. )  (EDS: Production notes at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   By far the most moving scenes in ``October Sky'' are the
home-movie snippets, circa 1957, that show the real people on whom
the film's characters are based. Otherwise, despite its ``based on
a true story'' opening credit, this earnest, nostalgic film has a
way of seeming too good to be true.
</P>
<P>
   With the gung-ho wholesomeness of a Horatio Alger story by way
of Norman Rockwell, it tells how Homer H. Hickam Jr. grew up in a
West Virginia coal mining town and went from telling schoolmates,
``I'm gonna build a rocket like Sputnik!'' to a career as a NASA
engineer. The difference between aiming sky high or descending into
the mine is heavily emphasized, in both visual and dramatic terms.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Hickam's folksy, best-selling memoir, ``Rocket Boys,''
Joe Johnston's second and better rocket film (after ``The
Rocketeer'') contrasts Homer's high hopes with his all-but-certain
destiny. It makes the tension between this teen-ager and his tough,
coal-mining father its main concern. The senior Hickam, played by
Chris Cooper as a headstrong man to be reckoned with, is a
hard-driving mine foreman who simply has no way of understanding
his son's aspirations. Homer, played with beguiling eagerness by
Jake Gyllenhaal, has to choose between frustrating his father and
shooting for the stars.
</P>
<P>
   Comparisons to ``Stand by Me'' are unavoidable, since ``October
Sky'' has a small-town intimacy, a group of close-knit pals and the
kind of innocence seldom found on screen these days. What it also
has is a predictable trajectory that works against such appealing
simplicity. As adapted by Lewis Colick, the screenplay shifts
busily among the boys' rocket exploits, Homer's family, conditions
at the mine and the influence of a dedicated science teacher (Laura
Dern), but each of these subplots plays out in familiar ways.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the story seems as inevitable as the guy who sidles up
to a rocket launch with a camera around his neck, asking, ``Which
one of you fellas is Homer Hickam?'' In a flash, Homer's picture
winds up in the local paper.
</P>
<P>
   The film watches Homer progress from accidentally blowing a hole
in the family's white picket fence, which virtually adjoins the
mine, to learning how to make a rocket soar. With the aid of his
closest buddies (Chris Owen, William Lee Scott and Chad Lindberg),
Homer draws on limited local resources for his rocketry
experiments. Since this means commandeering metal from railroad
tracks and visiting a still for 100-proof rocket fuel, the story
has its playful side.
</P>
<P>
   In a film that appreciates the advent of ``Jailhouse Rock''
along with that of Sputnik, ``Ain't That a Shame?'' accompanies a
montage of rockets gone kerflooey. A pretty girl is on hand to
sigh, ``It sure was exciting watching your rockets go up!''
</P>
<P>
   Gyllenhaal does seem more like the Columbia University freshman
he is than the rural West Virginian he plays. But he brings such
sincerity to telling his science teacher that a book called
``Principles of Guided Missile Design'' is the best present he has
ever received that his affecting performance is liable to breathe
life into science projects everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Owen, bespectacled and goofy as the stereotypical math geek,
suits the film's taste for typecasting as well as its quaintly
1950s look, which calls for studiously modest props and costumes,
and for townsfolk who are often Rockwellishly agog.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper gives natural authority and a second or third dimension
to the senior Homer, who is here called John and, of course,
eventually comes to appreciate his son's achievements. As Homer's
mother, Natalie Canerday of ``Sling Blade'' shows more zest than
even the niftiest schoolboy rocket launch can provide.
</P>
<P>
   ``October Sky'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It
includes mild profanity and is otherwise quite suitable for
children.

`JAWBREAKER' MAKES SOPHOMORIC ATTEMPT AT DARK HUMOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Jawbreaker'' starts off with such forceful bad taste, it
threatens to turn into ``Very Bad Things at Ridgemont High.'' Only
in this case, it's Reagan High, where things shake up when sweet,
popular teen Liz Purr chokes to death on the title object when her
three best friends stage a fake kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Liz was one of the school's in crowd, and her death changes its
dynamics. Girlfriend/kidnapper Courtney (''Scream's'' Rose
McGowan), who's so popular that she has her own parking space,
masterminds a cover-up, because even an accidental killing can put
a crimp in your social status. Julie (''Urban Legend's'' Rebecca
Gayheart) has the temerity to have a conscience, which gets her
banished from Courtney's inner circle. Marcie Fox (Julie Benz), who
wears a necklace that says ``Foxy,'' sticks with Courtney because
Marcie's a follower _ the movie tells us so, but the real reason
she's a follower is that writer-director Darren Stein can't be
bothered to come up with a character for her.
</P>
<P>
   School outcast Fern Mayo (Judy Evans Greer) stumbles upon the
killing, so Courtney makes her a deal: a makeover in exchange for
silence. Naturally, the makeover turns Fern _ now Vylette _ into a
monster, and in case we miss the point, Stein films the transition
as if it were a combination of a Frankenstein movie and a Vidal
Sassoon commercial. This is quite a makeover: Not only does it make
Fern/Vylette more popular, it lets her afford a new Corvette with
vanity plates.
</P>
<P>
   Fern/Vylette does this without benefit of parents, which
Courtney doesn't have either. Stein stunt-casts former teen-movie
stars P.J. Soles (''Rock and Roll High School''), William Katt
(''Carrie'') and Jeff Conaway (''Grease'') as the other girls'
parental units; maybe he doesn't give Courtney and Fern moms and
dads because he ran out of trivia-question answers.
</P>
<P>
   But then, Stein loves stunts. He's never met a directing trick
he didn't like, and the movie is stuffed with noisy transitions,
pretentious freeze frames and overstated slow motion (not to
mention wall-to-wall alt-rock music cues). The result is a
bizarrely fascinating hodgepodge of ``Heathers,'' Brian De Palma,
bad '60s college-student art films, and even '50s exploitation
pictures such as ``High School Confidential!''
</P>
<P>
   There's not much to say about the performances, because Stein
deals in caricatures, not characters, although McGowan has a
commanding witchiness and Greer an appealing delicacy that keep
their roles from getting lost. Pam Grier is wasted as investigating
Detective Vera Cruz _ it took imagination to come up with that
name, huh? _ and Carol Kane is simply casting shorthand as the
school's eccentric principal. McGowan's real-life paramour, Marilyn
Manson, shows up in a gratuitous cameo.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps every teen generation needs a ``Heathers''-inspired dark
comedy like ``Jawbreaker,'' but come on _ there's a good movie to
be made about high-school popularity politics, and we don't get it
from ``Jawbreaker's'' bitter, overdirected nastiness any more than
we got it from the shallow, underdirected hypocrisy of ``She's All
That.'' But at least the latter wasn't unpleasant; ``Jawbreaker,''
which tries to milk nervous laughter out of situations involving
rape and necrophilia, gives you the feeling that 26-year-old Stein
made it just because he hasn't worked through his adolescent rage.

IT'S A NEON BRIGHT WORLD ON THE STREET OF THEATERS, STARS AND SO
MUCH MORE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the song says, the neon lights are bright on
Broadway. But looking at them won't give you the blues.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a stroll south down the key blocks of Broadway _ from
West 64th Street and the Lincoln Center to West 43rd Street and the
back of Times Square _ is as entertaining a two or three hours as
any New York tourist might want to spend.
</P>
<P>
   The best place to begin is Lincoln Center. During daylight
hours, it's imposing, with various performance halls placed like
the playhouses of giants amid confined but reasonably verdant green
space. At night, it's better; stretch limos swoop to the curb,
depositing tuxedo- and evening gown-clad glitterati out for an
evening of opera, symphony or ballet.
</P>
<P>
   Moving south, the next sight is the Trump International Hotel
and Tower (''Gremlins 2,'' anyone?) and Columbus Circle. Central
Park beckons across the way, and, despite what you've heard about
muggers lingering behind every shrub, it's a fine place for a
noontime constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the wonderful Columbus Circle Market, with vendors
hustling fresh fruit, pastries, hot dogs spiffed up with tangy
mustard, and other more ``unique'' items, such as ``genuine'' Swiss
Army watches, for instance, available at that moment only for just
$20. They sell for $150 in stores, folks, and I'm only gonna be
here selling 'em for another couple minutes. Make up your minds.
</P>
<P>
   The vendors are a colorful lot, and not a bit shy about touting
even their most questionable wares. A portly man pushing ``designer
blazers'' for $5 each notes, ``Hey, if they were made, they had to
be designed, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Right.
</P>
<P>
   At 58th Street, you must cross two streets to pick up ``Broadway
Southbound.'' The route is well-marked and just about impossible to
miss. The sidewalks are tightly packed, and you can tell the native
New Yorkers _ they're the ones blithely ignoring the ``Don't walk''
signs and daring screaming taxi drivers to run into them.
</P>
<P>
   At this point in your stroll, it's time for a snack. The Cosmic
Coffee Shop on 58th and Broadway Southbound is inviting. In its
way, Cosmic represents the dozens of theater-related eateries that
proliferate along the rest of your route. Breakfast oatmeal _ $4 a
bowl _ comes doused in milk even if you say you don't want it
served like that, and the walls are plastered with framed,
autographed pictures. About one-third feature celebrities you've
actually heard of: Brooke Shields, Pierce Brosnan, Bud Melman, Bill
Paxton. Presumably, these people have partaken of milky oatmeal
right where you might be sitting.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrity-spotting is a New York must. Everybody who has been
there has a story about seeing a star. (''Paul Simon was sitting in
the booth next to me, and I didn't say anything to him, but when he
left, he left his newspaper, and I went over and got it.'') On this
particular stroll, there's a tall, willowy woman waiting to cross
at 57th Street, right next to the Hard Rock Cafe. Despite her scarf
and dark glasses, she looks so familiar _ yes! It's Nicole Kidman,
in town for a limited appearance at a theater just a few blocks
down Broadway. The next day, a taxi driver offers the helpful
information that Kidman and movie-star husband Tom Cruise have an
apartment nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Sated with oatmeal and knowing that I'm close to somebody
famous, I travel three more blocks. The Ed Sullivan Theater is at
Broadway and 54th, and so is a long, looping line of folks hoping
to be admitted for the night's taping of ``The David Letterman
Show.'' A Letterman assistant is outside explaining the rules:
``When David asks for questions, don't ask stupid ones. If you ask
something smart, he'll really give you an answer. And if you're
close enough, you can go ahead and shake his hand. But don't kiss
him or hug him. He doesn't like that.''
</P>
<P>
   At 53rd Street, the theaters that give Broadway its most lasting
fame begin to appear, usually a block removed from the street
itself. First on this southward stroll is ``Miss Saigon,'' now in
its ``8th BIG YEAR!!!'' at the Broadway Theatre and, apparently,
still going strong.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 10 blocks, you can gawk at theaters offering every
sort of production, often with big-name stars advertised on posters
and billboards. Broadway is a place of massive advertisements. The
sides of office buildings are festooned with mega-posters touting
everything from Coca-Cola to Jell-O.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   You also can visit places you've vaguely heard of _ Max's Kansas
City, immortalized in song by John Lennon in the early '70s (''We
went down to Max's Kansas City/Got down to the nitty-gritty)''
turns out to be an ordinary-looking nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-first Street has ``Cats'' on one corner and Radio City
Music Hall a few blocks farther down. On 50th, Comedy Nation
features appearances by Bobcat Goldthwait and Robert Klein.
``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown'' is back at the Ambassador
Theatre on 49th, and looking straight ahead you can see the
familiar tower in Times Square where the big ball drops on New
Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   At this point on your stroll, you're focusing on
people-watching. Certain patterns emerge; for instance, forget the
fashion buzz that black is out as the color of choice. Broadway
teems with black _ coats, sweaters, hats, slacks, shoes, even
lipstick.
</P>
<P>
   Every corner features wizened old men trying to pass out
handbills for bargain meals at restaurants; they look like they
desperately need to eat these meals themselves. Circling them
warily are bejeweled matrons hauling around perfectly coiffed
poodles on leashes. Each dog is being encouraged to relieve itself
quickly so Mama can go back inside. ``Inside'' refers to various
towering apartment units, none of which most of us could afford. A
sign in one tower's lower window notes that a few two-bedroom,
one-bath units are for sale, starting at $2.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Street mimes aren't exactly ubiquitous, but you do see several.
They've placed hats or boxes nearby to be used as receptacles for
tips, and one arriving mime blatantly ``salts'' his hat with a
handful of change before beginning his series of wordless
gyrations.
</P>
<P>
   Mounted police clop along, maneuvering their horses between
stalled taxis and other backed-up traffic. They have the
world-weary expressions of men who have seen everything, and they
probably have. Tourists ask them to pose for photos, and they never
seem to refuse.
</P>
<P>
   The Stage Door Deli and Crowne Plaza Hotel dominate around 49th
Street. The Roxy Delicatessen is two blocks farther south, and
across the way is a massive Virgin Megastore. Whichever CD you
might want can probably be found here. Directly adjacent is the
All-Star Cafe, with massive photos on streetside walls featuring
its celebrity athlete owners: Ken Griffey Jr., Andre Agassi, Monica
Seles, Wayne Gretzky. Hamburgers are very expensive there, though
for nine bucks you also get a pickle.
</P>
<P>
   It's here that banners hanging from lampposts begin to herald
``The New Times Square,'' but a sign at the bus stop identifies the
area as ``Duffy Square.'' There are still a half-dozen blocks to
go.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently, a revival of ``Annie, Get Your Gun'' at the Marriott
Theatre is going to be the next big Broadway hit. The production
stars Bernadette Peters and Tom Wopat _ huge posters, big even by
Broadway standards, festoon the sides of the theater. Though the
show won't open for a few more days, even at 10 a.m. there is a
line at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   At 45th is the famous Lindy's Cafe and Restaurant, its windows
adorned with posters of its equally famous cheesecake. Even Lindy's
sandwiches are advertised as ``overstuffed.'' Modesty in marketing
is not part of the Broadway culture.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-fourth Street offers the current hot productions _
``Chicago'' and ``The Phantom of the Opera.'' Both are beloved by
out-of-towners wanting to brag to Marge back home about the
Broadway shows they got to see; Marge, no matter how much of a
bumpkin, will have heard of ``Chicago'' and ``The Phantom.''
</P>
<P>
   Times Square looms. A giant-screen TV, this one the size of the
Goodyear Blimp, flashes advertisements for various products.
Broadway goes on behind it, but there's no need to go any farther.
A serving of Lindy's cheesecake, perhaps, will provide the
sustenance necessary for the strength to walk back north. Maybe
Nicole Kidman will be standing on the corner again.

MORALE IN THIS `OFFICE' IS THE MORAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Judge has a subversive brain, but it's fueled by the heart
of a moralist, a guy with a distinct vision of what's right and
wrong. ``Office Space,'' Judge's first live-action feature, is shot
through with that mix: The subversiveness keeps the film on track,
and although the moralism doesn't exactly derail it, it keeps the
movie from reaching optimum speed.
</P>
<P>
   As an animator, Judge has always found a mouthpiece for his
traditionalist views. He did it indirectly with ``Beavis and
Butt-head,'' seeing the oddness of the '90s through the eyes of two
morons while using them as symbols of that oddness. He does it
directly with ``King of the Hill,'' in which modern life flummoxes
hero Hank Hill, whose old-fashioned values neverthless prevail in
the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Office Space's'' protagonist is Peter, a twentysomething
slacker in white-collar clothing. ``Swingers''' Ron Livingston
plays Peter with big dark eyes so devoid of sparkle, it's as if the
fluorescent lights at his cubicle-dominated workplace have sapped
out his soul. The first 20 minutes of ``Office Space'' are the
best, as they show Peter and co-workers Samir and Michael in their
snail-paced commutes and tedious early work hours. Peter is so
burned out that his ambitious girlfriend takes him to a
hypnotherapist in an attempt to get him to like work more _ but the
hypnotherapist suffers a calamity just as Peter goes under, leaving
Peter under a spell.
</P>
<P>
   It's a funny scene, but it's also where ``Office Space'' begins
to lose ground, because the movie begins to conform to a plot even
as it espouses a noncomformist message. Peter largely stops showing
up for work, and when he does come in, he looks like he's dressed
for a day of Frisbee golf. He confounds a couple of corporate
headhunters so much that they promote him, believing that he isn't
being challenged enough. Then Peter and his buddies come up with a
complicated embezzling scheme ...
</P>
<P>
   This is a lot of plot for an 89-minute movie, and it barely
leaves room for the romance that develops between Peter and a
Fridays-style waitress (Jennifer Aniston saves the underdefined
role simply by playing it as a smarter version of Rachel from
``Friends''). As in his cartoons, Judge is best at the peripheral
characters, whether they be the redneck neighbor (Diedrich Bader),
the recovering crackhead selling magazine subscriptions, or Peter's
infuriatingly nonconfrontational boss (Gary Cole, in a hilariously
dry performance).
</P>
<P>
   Or Milton, the sad-sack worker played by ``NewsRadio's'' Stephen
Root in a brilliantly nuanced performance that's so extraordinarily
chameleonic, Root would merit an Oscar nomination if the Academy
Awards paid attention to slacker comedies released in February.
Peter may be the protagonist, but Milton's the soul of the movie
(he was the star of Judge's original animated ``Office Space''
short), and he's the picture of almost-complete defeat: muttering,
barely able to finish a sentence, abused so much that his back
isn't just against the wall, it's against the wall in a darkened
basement office. Milton is a quiet time bomb, and he's where Judge
channels much of his outrage.
</P>
<P>
   He's also, unfortunately, an escape route for the movie's main
plot. Using Milton allows Judge to let Peter and his cronies off
the hook, as if Judge had too much conscience to let them get away
with the things that they do. It's where the moralism steps in, and
it holds back the anarchy that could have elevated the movie from
amusing to amazing.
</P>
<P>
   Because he's used to working with actors more than he is with
cameras, Judge handles the cast better than he does the movie's
rhythms. His direction is uneven despite a couple of inspired
scenes that play like a white-collar ``Reservoir Dogs.'' The
movie's quirky pacing is reminiscent of ``Rushmore,'' but
``Rushmore'' has the courage of its unconventionality. ``Office
Space'' is more like another Bill Murray movie, ``Stripes,'' in the
way it starts off anti-establishment only to wind up playing by the
rules. It gives you the laughs, but it stops short of giving you
the satisfaction a truly anarchic comedy can give.

PHOENIX: A PLACE IN THE SUN

 (af)  
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX, Ariz. _ This is a city well named. It may not have
arisen, like the fabulous bird of Egyptian mythology, from its own
ashes, but, like the original phoenix, this one sprang to life in a
desert.
</P>
<P>
   It owes its existence to modern technology. Without large-scale
irrigation and without air-conditioning, Phoenix as it now exists _
the sprawling, verdant, dynamic center of a metropolitan area of
more than 2.8 million people _ would have been utterly unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   With temperatures exceeding 100 degrees on more than 90 days a
year, with an average high temperature in July of 106 degrees,
God's own ungentled climate in the Sonoran Desert is better suited
for cacti and Gila monsters than human beings.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the year-round warmth here in the Salt River Valley,
long since rechristened the Valley of the Sun by promoters who
found the original name insufficiently poetic, lacks its uses. For
starters, it is good for growing things. The Roosevelt Dam,
finished in 1911, and a half-dozen other ambitious projects made
commercial cultivation of cotton possible. Lettuce and melons,
citrus fruits and dates are produced in quantity, too.
</P>
<P>
   Fugitives from the punishing winters and the clamorous cities of
the East and the Midwest have taken shelter here since the turn of
the century, when sun-seekers put up 30-odd tents and a half-dozen
adobe houses in Scottsdale, just east of Phoenix, which is now a
wealthy, self-consciously Southwestern resort- and gallery-filled
community of 150,000.
</P>
<P>
   In the modern era, the hot, arid conditions have proved ideal
for electronic manufacturing, and microchip plants keep springing
up in cotton fields. The Valley of the Sun has turned into Silicon
Valley Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the breakneck growth has been unplanned and
uncontrolled, and a permissive business culture has left plenty of
finagling room for high rollers like Charles H. Keating Jr., whose
savings and loan empire went belly up a decade ago, at immense cost
to the nation's taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Broad, straight avenues form a grid on the valley floor. Some
are lined with orange and grapefruit trees, but more are disfigured
by long, sterile parades of strip malls, shopping centers,
fast-food joints, motels and gas stations.
</P>
<P>
   Overreliance on the automobile and the freeway helps to create,
on bad days, a pall of smog that obscures the beauty of the ruddy,
jagged mountains that lie to the north, south, east and west of the
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   But when the air is clean and the sky is blue, or the sun is
setting, or the moon is full, it is easy to understand the
rhapsodies this landscape evoked in Frank Lloyd Wright 60-odd years
ago when he was building his winter home, Taliesin West, on
Maricopa Mesa, 20 miles from downtown Phoenix. It was ``a grand
garden,'' he wrote, ``the like of which in sheer beauty of space
and pattern does not exist, I think, in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, culturally minded people in Phoenix had to
make do with golf, and golf remains a major local preoccupation;
last year 2 million tourists and 500,000 Arizona residents played
11 million rounds on 187 golf courses in the metropolitan area (or
so says the visitors' bureau).
</P>
<P>
   But recent decades have brought an ambitious opera company,
directed for 15 years until his retirement in June by an ardent
Wagnerite, Glynn Ross; several new museums and the new Herberger
Theater Center, plus the restoration of another playhouse, the
Orpheum, a gem of Spanish Colonial Revival opulence.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Phoenix has acquired those other indispensable
testimonials to American urban success: professional sports teams.
The Phoenix Suns (basketball), the Arizona Cardinals (football),
the climate-defying Phoenix Coyotes (hockey) and now the Arizona
Diamondbacks (baseball) have done a lot for civic self-esteem, and
the Diamondbacks' stadium, Bank One Ballpark, with a retractable
dome, is another of the new fields, like those in Baltimore and
Denver, that are helping to revive faded downtowns.
</P>
<P>
   This is a casual city. Men wear string ties and women sport
silver jewelry studded with turquoises the size of quail's eggs.
Besides golf, people busy themselves with tennis and biking and
hiking on close-in trails and bouncing across the desert in
four-wheel-drive vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quality of life brings people here,'' said Sen. John
McCain, who moved to Phoenix after his release from a
prisoner-of-war camp in Vietnam. ``A friend of mine got in his car
once and drove up to Roosevelt Lake to water-ski, then headed up to
Flagstaff to snow ski. All in one day.''
</P>
<P>
   Another resident talks about ``no-brain, no-hassle living.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a startlingly young place. When Karl Baedeker (or, more
likely, one of his minions) passed this way in 1904, he found ``a
well-built, modern city'' of ... wait for it ... exactly 5,554
inhabitants. By that time, Los Angeles, the quintessential
Johnny-come-lately among American cities, already had 120,000.
</P>
<P>
   The big boom here began at the end of World War II, with the
dawn of the Age of Air-Conditioning. John Gunther came to town then
and reported, ``If you've been in Phoenix a year, you're an
old-timer.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Phoenix is counted as the nation's sixth-largest city.
</P>
<P>
   A new society, built from scratch, it lacks the stratification
that marks Philadelphia and Boston, even Chicago and San Francisco.
You find descendants of proud old Spanish families in Santa Fe and
to a lesser degree in Tucson, but not here. For the most part,
Spanish explorers gave northern Arizona a pass, leaving the Yavapai
and Pima Indians in peace.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the connections to the Old West are deeply felt. The
Army's struggle against Cochise and Geronimo, the great Apache
warriors, are as lively a folk memory in Phoenix as the exploits of
Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson are in Richmond. The cowboy
culture lives on in riding stables, rodeos and parades of
horse-drawn vehicles. Spanish street names and mariachis remind you
that the Mexican border is not far away.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona was a lawless place in the last half of the 19th
century. A Harvard geologist named Raphael Pumpelly visited the
state in that era to work as a mining engineer and wrote later of
``a climate of public opinion that blunted all ideas of right and
wrong in the minds of newcomers who, suddenly freed from the legal
and social restraints of the East, soon learned to justify the
taking of life by the most trifling pretexts, or even to destroy it
for the sake of bravado.''

LOSING SIGHT, BUT NOT OF WHAT'S IMPORTANT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The strangest part is hearing but not seeing, imagining but not
visualizing. Cedric Teale describes it as ``watching ghosts play in
a thick fog.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, something is there; most times, there's nothing. No
colors, no shapes. No smiles, no frowns, no gestures _ no emotion.
``Just frustration,'' he says. Frustration over the disappearance
of something he never thought much about until he no longer had it.
</P>
<P>
   Teale is going blind. Slowly, painfully, mercilessly. Born
without sight in his left eye, he worked hard to overcome the
disability. He forgot about sports and turned to music. His right
eye became, he puts it rather proudly, the equalizer.
</P>
<P>
   But a year ago, the vision in his right eye began to
deteriorate. Television has become his visual measuring stick.
There was a time when he noticed images but no color. Then shapes
but no images. Then large letters or numbers but nothing around
them.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's only ghosts playing in the fog.
</P>
<P>
   The peculiar thing about all this, says Teale, who is 68 and
otherwise quite physically fit, is that he never watched much
television. His wife, Sarah, who died of a heart attack three years
ago, was the tube viewer, faithful to ``The Oprah Winfrey Show,''
``Melrose Place,'' daytime soap operas, any sappy movie on
Lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Teale classifies himself as an outdoors guy living in the city,
someone who spends time working with his hands, whether tending the
greenery surrounding his four-bedroom, split-level home in far west
Fort Worth or his dentless 1990 Seville.
</P>
<P>
   He was also a voracious reader of books and newspapers, even
scripts of plays. A man of arts and letters, he says, laughing at
the smug sound of that. Then after a pause, he proclaims, ``But I
don't do much of that anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, between surgeries, television came into his life,
nudging him like a stranger wanting and needing affection. It had
sat there two years, dark and dusty. It wasn't that Teale had seen
television as the enemy _ how could he, since it held his wife's
heart, made her laugh, made her angry, made her ``feel.'' ``She'd
actually `talk' to the television set, as though it was a breathing
mechanism,'' he says. ``And she'd talk to me about characters on TV
shows as though they were real. I started to wonder about her
sanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Teale would walk by and shake his head, not in disgust but in
laughter, needling his wife for spending valuable time on something
that offered little in return.
</P>
<P>
   But Teale would get hooked on ``Walker, Texas Ranger'' and
``NYPD Blue,'' dramas as different as light and dark. He liked the
escapism offered up by the high-kicking Chuck Norris, whom he was
seeing for the first time. (He'd steered clear of Chuck's feature
films.) He thought the action was cartoonish and silly and just the
sort of thing that took him, briefly, away from his daily
existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``NYPD Blue'' was more of a test, a realistic cop drama that
wasn't as interested in tying up its episodes with big red bows.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't see but ``listened'' as Jimmy Smits' Bobby Simone
slipped into death. ``They played it out over several episodes, and
I remember thinking it was a lot like going blind,'' he says.
``It's gradual. You dream and you see. You wake up and all a sudden
it's this initial jolt that, `My God, I can't see.' I remember him
saying something about waking up was the hardest thing because at
least when you dream, you usually dream of what you used to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``What hit me at that point, and why I called you, was the fact
that I never knew I could actually get anything out of television.
That ``Walker'' character made me laugh, made me feel better.
Watching, or rather, listening and imagining to the ``NYPD Blue''
story, I felt, well, I guess I felt like someone else was going
through it. I know it's a TV character and it's not real. That kind
of threw me for a loop. ME relating to TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Teale had always lived with the possibility of losing his sight,
and perhaps that had something to do with his dismissal of
television and its sedentary, often lowbrow gifts. In a perfect
world, he'd still rather work in his garden, mess around with the
Seville, play racquetball, read books and newspapers, or
people-watch in downtown Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just find it interesting, in a funny way, that I miss seeing
a host of things,'' Cedric says. ``And that television is one of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarah would be so tickled.

 PHOENIX, Ariz.: of bravado.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Outlaws like Billy the Kid operated with near-impunity. Starting
when he was 15 years old and 5 feet 7 inches tall, Billy roamed
through Arizona and New Mexico for 16 years until he was shot in
1891 by Sheriff Pat Garrett.
</P>
<P>
   Two other Hollywood favorites, Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday,
faced down the Clanton gang in a famous gunfight at the OK Corral
in Tombstone in 1881.
</P>
<P>
   Statehood arrived 31 years later _ Arizona was the last of the
lower 48 to enter the union _ with Phoenix as the capital. One man,
a conservative Democrat named Carl Hayden, formed a living
political link with the pioneer days for much of this century,
serving continuously in Congress, first in the House and then in
the Senate, from 1912 until 1969.
</P>
<P>
   A bit of the old buccaneering spirit has tainted modern Arizona
politics. Gov. Evan Mecham made ``enough of a fool of himself,'' in
the words of the author Michael Barone, that he was impeached and
removed from office in 1988. There have been several
well-documented bribery scandals in the state legislature.
</P>
<P>
   But the state has also produced politicians who have aroused
local and national affection rare in this era of widespread public
cynicism, like Barry Goldwater, a herald of the new Republican
conservatism, who crashed noisily in the 1964 presidential campaign
but found himself venerated late in life as a nonpartisan wise man,
and Morris K. Udall, a bright, witty, sweet-natured Democratic
congressman who also failed in presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
   Screened by a pretty row of old olive trees, the Heard Museum is
Arizona's premier cultural institution. It houses one of the
nation's leading collections of the treasures of Indian
civilizations, which have waxed and waned in these parts for at
least 15,000 years, as the land turned from grassy savanna to
desert.
</P>
<P>
   Brightly hued rugs, basketwork of astonishing delicacy, Navajo
and Zuni and Hopi jewelry and hundreds of kachina dolls, donated by
Goldwater and the hotel pioneer Fred Harvey, bear eloquent witness
to the creativity of countless, mostly nameless Native American
artists.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the collection of Indian pottery, a particular passion
of my wife, Betsey, that drew us to the Heard, and we were not
disappointed. The work of the best pueblos _ Acoma and San
Ildefonso and Santa Clara _ is represented in depth, not only the
traditional polychrome but also the glossy, often unadorned
blackware brought to national notice several decades ago by the
work of Maria Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   The Heard, which operates an unusually good craft shop, opens an
$18.2 million expansion later this month, and the new Scottsdale
Museum of Contemporary Art opened last weekend. Attendance at the
rapdily expanding Phoenix Art Museum has grown from 177,808 in 1988
to 324,976 last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps Phoenix will finally begin to put to rest the
inferiority complex that has plagued it,'' The Arizona Republic
suggested recently.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Art Museum has interesting collections of European
painting and sculpture (Rodin and Redon, Courbet and Kees van
Dongen) and American works (George Inness and William Merritt Chase
and the unjustly neglected Jo Davidson), its main interest for the
visitor is its collection of Western art.
</P>
<P>
   This includes not only the obligatory Remingtons and O'Keeffes
but also the work of Eastern visitors like Robert Henri and lesser
artists like Phimister Proctor, whose panther on the prowl riveted
our attention, and Lew Davis, whose depictions of early copper
camps recall Ben Shahn.
</P>
<P>
   The performing arts have had tougher sledding, and a number of
organizations came close to bankruptcy a decade ago. The Phoenix
Symphony narrowly avoided a strike among its musicians last year,
and with a base salary of $31,210 next season, they are still among
the lowest-paid in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Although soloists of the caliber of Joshua Bell and Yo-Yo Ma
play with it, the orchestra has never in its 50 years attracted a
big-name music director. The incumbent, Hermann Michael, once
worked as an assistant to Herbert von Karajan at the Vienna State
Opera.
</P>
<P>
   Under the flamboyant, publicity-minded Ross, the Arizona Opera
mounted full-scale Ring cycles at Flagstaff, not far from the Grand
Canyon, in the heart of what some German visitors who came to hear
them called ``der Vildenvest.'' Now the company has pulled in its
horns a bit _ not so surprisingly, given the red ink the Rings
generated.
</P>
<P>
   David A. Speers is the new administrator, from Calgary in
Canada. In this, his first season, the five-opera repertory has
been mostly traditional (``Andrea Chenier'' and ``La Boheme'' are
the two final productions), but in his second, he is including
Carlisle Floyd's tuneful ``Of Mice and Men,'' which Ross
commissioned in 1970 for the Seattle Opera.
</P>
<P>
   Both the symphony and the opera have headquarters at Symphony
Hall, a fortresslike structure of corrugated concrete. It is the
first concert hall I have ever seen without a single coming-events
poster outside. The hall stands at the center of the new downtown,
a somewhat windblown work in progress consisting of sports arenas,
new hotels, a science center, a history museum, old Art Deco
towers, vacant lots waiting for development, a gargantuan
convention center and a shopping mall of dubious design and taste.
</P>
<P>
   Across from Symphony Hall stands the fine new Herberger complex,
with two stages that house the spunky Arizona Ballet, whose most
famous alumnus is Jock Soto of the New York City Ballet; the
Arizona Theater Company, whose 1998-99 season includes Paula
Vogel's ``How I Learned to Drive'' and Alfred Uhry's ``Last Night
of Ballyhoo''; the Actors Theater of Phoenix and the Arizona Jewish
Theater Company. Out at Arizona State University in Tempe, Wright's
Grady Gammage Auditorium houses touring Broadway shows; ``Miss
Saigon'' is there right now.

 PHOENIX, Ariz.: right now.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you do make it to Tempe, be sure to see a newer building that
puts Wright's vulgar UFO-like auditorium to shame: the Nelson Fine
Arts Center, designed in 1990 by Antoine Predock, an Albuquerque
architect who reminds me a little of Louis I. Kahn. It is a stucco
mountain of a building, a pale desert purple, which the
architecture critic Paul Goldberger described as ``tough,
hard-edged and self-assured.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright was in far better form, of course, when he built Taliesin
West in the late 1930s. The great cantilevered drafting room is one
of his finest spaces, assembled from simple materials _ local
stones imbedded in coarse mortar, redwood beams painted Cherokee
red, his favorite color, and skylights covered at first with canvas
and later with translucent plastic.
</P>
<P>
   As always with Wright in his prime, the building revels in its
relationship to its setting. It snuggles back into the foothills of
the McDowell Range, invisible until you are almost upon it. And the
very simplicity of the architect's means echoes his appraisal of
the surrounding desert: ``Nature, driven to economize in materials
by hard conditions, generated bare, Spartan forms.''
</P>
<P>
   From Taliesin West you can see hundreds of Arizona's trademark
cacti, the anthropomorphic saguaros, known to people everywhere
from their bit parts in hundreds of westerns.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands more await the visitor at the splendid Desert
Botanical Garden, along with 4,000-odd other species of plants,
mostly cacti, succulents and wildflowers. The stately saguaros
sometimes live for hundreds of years, starting to grow their
characteristic upturned ``arms'' only at 75.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty years old this year, the Botanical Garden is rivaled only
by the Jardin Exotique in Monte Carlo, and it is far more
naturalistic; the cacti here are surrounded by desert, not a
Mediterranean city.
</P>
<P>
   Along the miles of footpaths southeast of Phoenix, the species
are clearly marked: bony-fingered ocatillos and paddle-shaped
prickly pears, both green and purple; spiny agaves and aloes, with
their spikes of yellow and orange blossoms; barrel cacti and
pincushions and organ pipes and totem poles and candelabras, whose
names describe them; cassia bushes, covered with yellow flowers;
wild lupines, just coming into bloom, and penstemons and desert
marigolds.
</P>
<P>
   It is an altogether magical place, especially in the flowering
season from now through May.
</P>
<P>
   Here is information about visiting the Phoenix area: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Where to Stay
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA BILTMORE, 24th Street and Missouri Avenue, (602)
955-6600. Designed in 1929 by Frank Lloyd Wright and Albert C.
McArthur, who had worked for him as a draftsman. They used a
patented system of richly patterned concrete blocks.
Sympathetically renovated since, with sumptuous suites added.
Opalescent light fixtures, earthy colors and stylized Aztec motifs
give this 600-room paragon a wholly original personality. Palms,
flower beds, fountains and eight (!) pools dot the grounds, which
also include tennis courts and golf courses. Double room rate: $415
to $475.
</P>
<P>
   THE BOULDERS, 34631 North Tom Darlington Drive, Carefree, (602)
488-9009, is regularly voted one of the top two or three resorts in
the nation, with good reason. Nestled in tranquil isolation among
12 million-year-old granite rocks, 20 miles from downtown Phoenix,
it blends effortlessly into its site. Pueblo-style casitas with log
ceilings and wood-burning fireplaces, furnished with rustic luxury,
plus unexcelled sporting facilities make this a desert paradise.
Smell the cumin-scented air. Watch the jackrabbits. Suite rate:
$545; casitas: $720 to $1,120.
</P>
<P>
   RITZ CARLTON PHOENIX, 2401 East Camelback Road, (602) 468-0700.
An urban hotel rather than a resort, and somewhat formal by
unbuttoned Arizona standards, with European oils and porcelain on
display in the public rooms. The 281 bedrooms, each with a marble
bathroom, live up to Ritz standards, featuring fine furniture,
safes, ironing boards and deluxe minibars. Double room rate: $245
to $269.
</P>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE PRINCESS, 7575 East Princess Drive, Scottsdale, (602)
585-4848. Convention-ready with 429 rooms, 125 casitas and 75
villas set against the McDowell Mountains, this palatial oasis
covers 450 gracefully landscaped acres where bougainvillea and
shrub-size rosemary flourish. Now that the superchef Alessandro
Stratta has left the Phoenician, the Princess' Marquesa is probably
the best of the city's many fine hotel dining rooms, serving
Catalan cuisine of extraordinary sophistication and authenticity.
Double room rate: $399 to $479.

 PHOENIX, Ariz.: to $479.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Where to Eat
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTOPHER'S FERMIER, 2584 East Camelback Road, (602) 522-2344.
Once Christopher Gross ran one of Phoenix's grander restaurants;
now he has opted for informality. Open day and night, seven days a
week, his new brasserie fits the city well. Soups, salads, pastas
and comfort food aplenty (three-star hanger steak, cassoulet, roast
chicken) are complemented by carefully handled cheeses (St.
Marcellin, Tete de Moines and four from the Egg Farm Dairy in the
Hudson Valley). Wines from all over and house-made microbrews.
</P>
<P>
   LOS DOS MOLINOS, 8646 South Central Avenue, (602) 243-9113. On
the far southern edge of the city sits an old hacienda where the
cowboy star Tom Mix lived at his death in 1940. Now it is an
unashamedly down-home Mexican restaurant of rare quality, festooned
with skeins of peppers and neon beer signs, named after the mills
(molinos) used for hand-grinding fiery chilies from Hatch, N.M.
Start with a cheese crisp, a big, skinny tortilla covered with
melted cheese; move on to the torrid, tender adovada ribs and
finish with sopapillas, airy pastry pillows topped with honey and
cinnamon.
</P>
<P>
   VINCENT GUERITHAULT, 3930 East Camelback Road, (602) 224-0225.
This is what happens when an accomplished chef from Lorraine by way
of Provence meets the Southwest: You taste uncommon delights like
smoked salmon quesadillas with horseradish cream and firm, tender
sweetbreads coated with blue corn meal. You drink the world's great
wines, from Petrus to Stag's Leap, chosen by Christie Dufault, a
talented young sommelier. You do it in solid bourgeois comfort. All
in all, this is Phoenix's most rewarding restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   HAPA, 6204 North Scottsdale Road, (602) 998-8220. This is a
dandy new spot specializing in Asian-American food, by which I
don't mean chow mein. I mean cool, fresh shrimp rolls with a citrus
dipping sauce good enough to drink; a vegetarian bento box
highlighted by a taco-shaped dumpling stuffed with eggplant and
avocado and tofu packets filled with pickled vegetables; a plate of
udon noodles with grilled prawns, Chinese vegetables and a spicy
coconut broth; a banana cream tart with coconut ice cream. Every
dish was original, light, balanced.
</P>
<P>
   NORMAN'S ARIZONA, 4410 North 40th Street, (602) 956-2288. Norman
Fierros' Nueva Mexicana dishes show the influence of the Anglo
chefs he worked with in Beverly Hills. His pared-down dining room,
which opened last Cinco de Mayo, is decorated with works by local
artists (currently, oversize photos of Maria Callas). We were
dazzled by the campechana, a towering cocktail of prawns, fish and
clams in a rich, cucumber-spiked tomato sauce; refined baby tamales
made from green corn, and a stuffed pork loin in a pool of rich
apricot salsa.
</P>
<P>
   PIZZERIA BIANCO, 623 East Adams Street, (602) 258-8300. The
Bronx-born Chris Bianco is the Valley's favorite chef. In an old
brick building downtown, too small for the throngs that go there,
he makes his own mozzarella, bakes his pies in a wood-fired brick
oven and tops them with fennel sausages, wood-roasted cremini
mushrooms and other good things. No reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ROXSAND, 2594 East Camelback Road, (602) 381-0444. I know of no
other chef anywhere who tries as many cuisines as RoxSand Scocos
and succeeds as often. Her current menu includes dishes inspired by
Iran, Hawaii, Japan, Italy, Austria, France, Africa and Mexico.
Situated in a kind of upscale food court, RoxSand is a bright,
peppy, modern place, with lots of rusted steel. Try the b'stilla, a
Moroccan poultry pie sprinkled with almonds and powdered sugar (a
real triumph), and her wicked pastries _ she studied with Gaston
Lenotre. &QL;

`TOO RICH: THE SECRET LIFE OF DORIS DUKE:' UNHAPPY AT LAST, AND AT
FIRST 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.)  
 (bl)  
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Early in ``Too Rich: The Secret Life of Doris Duke,'' Bernard
Lafferty, the title character's butler, conveys his disapproval of
cosmetic surgery, and Doris (Lauren Bacall) says: ``How would you
know, Bernard? Have you ever had a facelift?'' Bernard (Richard
Chamberlain) seems taken aback. ``Good heavens, no,'' he tells her.
So credibility is strained from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too Rich,'' a two-part CBS movie that begins Sunday night, is
not the worst four hours of mansions, lovers, errant husbands,
betrayals, period flashbacks and poor-little-rich-girl laments ever
made, but for a film with all this star power, it's a
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bacall, who started out so beautiful that she can still be a
knockout at 74, bravely and convincingly faces the camera for many
of her scenes in deglamorized dying-old-lady mode and in equally
unflattering states of overmedication. She plays Doris Duke at the
end of her life (Duke died in 1993 at the age of 80) and in
flashbacks from the 1950s on, but she's dealing with dialogue
that's low on grace and subtlety. This is a script, after all, that
has Doris as a 12-year-old (Hayden Panettiere) announce to her
cold, cruel mother: ``I'm here to stay. And you can either accept
that or I'll see you in court.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Too Rich'' was written by Dennis Turner, whose credits include
``Leona Helmsley: The Queen of Mean,'' and Ronni Kern, the author
of ``Deep in the Heart,'' the recent CBS movie starring Anne
Bancroft and Gloria Reuben. The film is directed by John Erman,
whose career has ranged from brilliant successes (``Roots'') to
grave errors (``Scarlett'').
</P>
<P>
   This team's greatest crime is in its treatment of Chamberlain's
character. The real Bernard Lafferty was described as flamboyant
and charming, and he was in his 40s during the last years of Duke's
life. Chamberlain (light of my long-lost adolescence) is 63 and, in
this role, utterly charmless as an almost cartoonish villain who
spends most of his time pouring dangerous capsules into Duke's
vitamin bottle. ``And from now on, all decisions will be made by
me,'' Bernard tells the other servants.
</P>
<P>
   It seems impossible that Doris would ever have found this man's
act convincing enough to have put him in charge of doorbell
polishing, much less have given him power of attorney.
</P>
<P>
   But Lindsay Frost is appealing (with a robustly glamorous
Kathleen Turner look) as the young Doris, even if her romantic
travails seem like the march of lovers from a dozen other
television movies. The first man in Doris' life was, of course, her
father. But Buck Duke (Joe Don Baker) died in 1925 when Doris was
12, leaving her his entire American Tobacco Co. fortune and one
piece of advice: no one will ever love you for anything but your
money.
</P>
<P>
   Doris' first husband, James Cromwell (Howard McGillin), proves
that true when on their honeymoon his check for the Atlantic
passage bounces. Doris' second husband, Porfirio Rubirosa (Michael
Nouri), has money of his own but cheats sexually, so that marriage
lasts only a year. ``I've never been surprised by rejection,''
Doris tells her friend Barbara Hutton at one point. ``Some people
are, I guess. But I learned at a very early age to expect it.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Doris (now played by Ms. Bacall) finds true love
with the nature-loving novelist Louis Bromfield (Brian Dennehy),
but after he teaches her to shell peas and ride on a tractor, he
dies.
</P>
<P>
   Just before World War II, between marriages, Doris had had an
affair with Duke Kahanamoku (Brian Stokes-Mitchell), an Olympic
swimmer, and had a baby daughter who died. More than 40 years
later, she runs into Chandi Heffner (Mare Winningham) at a hare
krishna retreat and decides Chandi is the reincarnation, or at
least the spirit, of her daughter. Against the advice of her
lawyers, Duke promptly adopts her. And of course Chandi turns out
to be rotten to the core.
</P>
<P>
   At least ``Too Rich'' looks good most of the time. Filmed in
Hawaii, Los Angeles and Montreal, it manages to make the point that
if you're going to be miserable and insecure, you might as well do
it in spectacular rooms, surrounded by gorgeous gardens, with
people bringing you things.
</P>
<P>
   The real Lafferty was exonerated of charges that he had hastened
Duke's death with drugs, which meant he could keep his $5 million
inheritance and his $500,000-a-year job as co-executor of her
estate. But Lafferty didn't enjoy the good life for long. He died
in 1996, only three years after Duke. Ms. Heffner, although
disinherited, received $65 million.

</P>
<P>
   ABOUT-CARS-CHEROKEE-NYT (Undated) _ ``Ask the man who owns
one,'' Packard used to advise, on the theory that a satisfied
customer provided the most believable kind of advertising. So ask
me about the Jeep Grand Cherokee, two of which have have joined my
household over the last four years. You can fool some of the people
some of the time, but 55,000 miles of hard driving will uncover
most serious flaws. I am happy to report that the Grand Cherokees I
know best _ leased in succession from the same suburban New York
dealer _ have performed admirably. By James G. Cobb.
</P>
<P>
   CAR-SMART-QUADRA-DRIVE-NYT (Undated) _ Four-wheel-drive systems
have been around about as long as automobiles. And until recently,
they haven't changed radically. But with the rekindling of interest
in four-wheel drives due to the popularity of sport utilities and
pickup trucks combined with advancements in sophisticated
electronics, four-wheel-drive systems are changing. An innovation
likely to catch on is one used on some versions of the 1999 Jeep
Grand Cherokee. The Grand Cherokee equipped with the new
Quadra-Drive four-wheel-drive system marks the industry's first use
of this new system. By Michelle Krebs.
</P>
<P>
   AUTOS-ROADSIDE-BOS (Undated) _ To dealer Paul Holloway, the
Mercedes roadside program has been the most successful in the
industry because it's not subcontracted. By Bill Griffith.
</P>
<P>
   AUTO-REVIEW-BOS (Undated) _ 1999 Sonata will change the way you
think about Hundai. By Bill Griffith.
</P>
<P>
   AUTOS-LEASE-BOS (Undated) _ To buy or lease. That is the
question.
</P>
<P>
   AUTOS-MODELS-BOS (Undated) _ The new cars continue to roll out
of the factories. Coming soon are a new Neon, a new sporty Honda
Civic, an S model from Jaguar, new Chevrolets, Buicks, Pontiacs, a
small Lincoln, and vans and trucks. While most of these will be out
this spring, they will be racing to be the first of the 2000
models, not 1999s.
</P>
<P>
   AUTOS-COUPES-BOS (Undated) _ The coupe is back in favor in the
automobile world. It isn't that these two-door models ever left the
car scene, but this year they are `in' as never before. And more
new models are on the way.
</P>
<P>
   AUTOS-SUVS-BOS (Undated) _ Just when you think you've seen all
the sport-utility vehicles imaginable, along come more. And the end
isn't in sight. Let's face it: Sport-utes are hot. By Jerry
Morris.''

REAGAN'S `STAR WARS' VISION FINDS LIFE IN CLINTON ADMINISTRATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Feb. 21)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Reagan in 1983 envisioned an elaborate
space-based shield to protect the United States against a doomsday
nuclear missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   Though such a defense has remained technologically elusive for
the last 16 years and all but lost its original military rationale
after the demise of the Soviet Union, the Clinton administration is
edging closer to fulfilling Reagan's dream.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials concluded last month that the threat of
a missile attack from a ``rogue nation'' such as North Korea or
Iran was significant enough to warrant development of a defense
shield.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are affirming that there is a threat, and the threat is
growing, and that it will pose a danger not only to our troops
overseas but also to Americans here at home,'' Defense Secretary
William Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan envisioned lasers and rockets parked in space
intercepting thousands of Soviet nuclear missiles, a concept he
called the Strategic Defense Initiative, or SDI, and that critics
labeled ``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   But in one of Washington's little ironies, a program once
ridiculed by congressional Democrats as wasteful spending is now
being touted by a Democratic administration.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's model is much smaller and based on
ground-based missiles that would shoot down an incoming enemy
missile in the outer reaches of the Earth's atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen has proposed spending a total of $10.5 billion for the
effort through 2005, subject to congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   The new program, known as National Missile Defense, is designed
to hit only a few missiles sent aloft by ``rogue nations'' or a
single intercontinental ballistic missile accidentally launched by
Russia or China.
</P>
<P>
   No final decision has been made on deploying the system.
Instead, Clinton has set June 2000 as the deadline to decide
whether to take the system out of the laboratory and build an
actual functioning version. The goal would be to have it in place
by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   A decision to deploy would turn mainly on two variables: If
there continues to be a growing missile threat from potential foes
and if the Pentagon can achieve the technological breakthroughs
required so that this complex system of advanced sensors, radars
and missiles would actually work.
</P>
<P>
   A major concern is that it would simply be too difficult to
track and destroy a missile traveling several times the speed of
sound and to blow it up by ramming it with another missile, all in
the span of several minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Third World nations unfriendly to the United States have been
acquiring sophisticated ballistic missile technology _ the know-how
to load and launch a missile with explosives or chemical and
biological warheads and target a distant point on the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Top U.S. military officials assert that the threat to U.S.
cities has increased significantly and continues apace.
</P>
<P>
   Last July, an independent panel headed by former Defense
Secretary Donald Rumsfeld concluded that adversaries like North
Korea, Iran or Libya could fire an ICBM at the United States within
a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   In early February, CIA officials briefed the House National
Security Committee on the threat posed by North Korea's Taepo Dong
I missile. The findings alarmed Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., the
chairman of the committee's research and development subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending upon the payload, that rocket can hit not just
Alaska and Hawaii, but depending upon the payload could hit well
into the central part of the mainland of the U.S.,'' said Weldon.
``That has never been stated publicly before.''
</P>
<P>
   News organizations in Japan recently reported that North Korea
had made significant strides developing a new class of long-range
ballistic missile capable of reaching parts of the United States,
the Taepo Dong II.
</P>
<P>
   Weldon considers the threat from North Korea so great that he is
pushing the administration to commit now _ rather than wait until
2000 to decide _ to field the defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Iran, meanwhile, has a long-range missile in development, the
Shabab-3, which it could modify quickly to strike the United States
if North Korea supplies key components, CIA Director George Tenet
recently told a Senate panel.
</P>
<P>
   Army Lt. Gen. Patrick Hughes, the director of the Defense
Intelligence Agency, said, ``I am increasingly concerned that
adversaries _ notably North Korea and Iran _ will develop and field
nuclear-armed missiles with intercontinental range.''
</P>
<P>
   Although U.S. efforts to develop a missile defense system have
been underway since Reagan unveiled ``Star Wars,'' progress has
been very slow, mainly because of technical hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   From 1983 to 1993, Reagan's SDI program spent more than $45
billion without achieving major technological breakthroughs, much
less building effective systems, according to Joseph Cirincione, a
senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The program was significantly scaled back in Clinton's first
term because the technology was lagging and also because the No. 1
military threat _ the Soviet Union _ had dissolved.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Ballistic Missile Defense Office (BMDO), the
Pentagon agency responsible for National Missile Defense, the new
system under consideration would employ four main components:
</P>
<P>
   - space- and ground-based sensors to provide early warning of
attacking missiles;
</P>
<P>
   - ground-based radars to track the threatening warheads;
</P>
<P>
   - ground-based missile interceptors based in North Dakota and
possibly Alaska to collide with and destroy enemy warheads; and
</P>
<P>
   - a battle management system that would link up all the
components with military commanders.
</P>
<P>
   The United Missile Defense Co., a venture among Lockheed Martin,
Raytheon and TRW, is managing the Pentagon program.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (STORY COULD END HERE - OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But such a system faces extensive technical obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Air Force Gen. Larry Welch in a report released by BMDO
last year warned that the National Missile Defense program was
``highly unlikely'' to succeed because it lacked a realistic plan.
The report accused Pentagon managers of a ``rush to failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Welch's report found that of 17 tests conducted by the Pentagon
since 1982 of ``hit to kill'' interceptors, only four, or 23
percent, actually hit their targets. Welch found that of the 14
tests directed against high-altitude targets _ an ICBM is
considered such a target _ only two hit their targets for a 14
percent success rate.
</P>
<P>
   Cirincione of the Carnegie Endowment asserts that the hurdles
are too high, given current technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does the technology exist to deploy a reliable defense against
intercontinental ballistic missiles? So far, the answer is no,''
Cirincione wrote in the ``Bulletin of Atomic Scientists.''
</P>
<P>
   (STORY COULD END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
   Another concern is a legal one. Deploying such a system might
force the United States to forego its obligations with the Russians
under the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty of 1972.
</P>
<P>
   The ABM treaty governs the conditions under which anti-ballistic
missile systems and components can be developed and deployed. The
treaty currently limits any future deployment to a single site near
Grand Forks, N.D. The administration is considering whether a
second location in Alaska would be a violation of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Arms control advocates worry that backing out of the treaty
would send a threatening signal to the Russians because it would
create a strategic imbalance favoring the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But Cohen disagrees, asserting that ``the limited (National
Missile Defense) capability we are developing ... will not be
capable of countering Russia's nuclear deterrent.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Somebody get me a musical!''
</P>
<P>
   That's been the subtext to recent maneuvering by some producers
who believe there is no runaway favorite for the Tony for best
musical this year, and that a new offering might have a good shot
at the prize.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the only prospects are ``Footloose,'' at the Richard
Rodgers; ``Parade,'' which closes at the Vivian Beaumont on Feb.
28, and ``Fosse,'` at the Broadhurst. ``The Civil War,'' opening in
April at the St. James, and ``Band in Berlin,'' headed for the
Helen Hayes in March, are also possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   This week another likely contender emerged when producers
announced that ``The Gershwins' Fascinating Rhythm'' would open at
the Longacre on April 25, three days before the Tony deadline.
Conceived by Mark Lamos and Mel Marvin, the show is a funked-up
revue of the brothers Gershwin's music.
</P>
<P>
   The timing wasn't planned, appearances to the contrary, said
Manny Kladitis, the show's lead producer. ``It truly is a happy
coincidence,'' he said. ``We were anticipating coming in last fall,
but we were delayed.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the producer Gregory Mosher was working the telephone
looking for some $3 million to raise ``The Dead,'' a musicalized
version of the short story by James Joyce, with a score by Shaun
Davie and lyrics by Davie and Richard Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   Mosher, the former artistic director of Lincoln Center Theater,
wants to rent the Vivian Beaumont for the production. He is selling
the show with some major names attached, including Patti LuPone; he
says she is interested in a leading role. The show was to have been
produced downtown this spring, but Mosher has been hunting for
Broadway real estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not in the Tony handicapping game, but the obvious does
not escape me,'' said Mosher. ``There's only four shows. There's
certainly room for another.''
</P>
<P>
   Several veteran producers have also been sniffing around the
previews of ``Bright Lights, Big City,'' a musical based on the
novel by Jay McInerney, opening on Wednesday at the New York
Theater Workshop, birthplace of ``Rent.''
</P>
<P>
   The hope seems to be that lightning will strike twice. The show
is directed by Michael Greif, the director of ``Rent,'' and has the
identical design team and a similarly handsome, multiracial cast.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the mood among producers as the Tony deadline nears,
Bernard Gersten, executive producer of Lincoln Center Theater said,
``The attitude seems to be, `Let's produce a musical by April 28
and we'll win it.'''
</P>
<P>
   But talking about moving a musical to Broadway and actually
raising the money to do it are two entirely different things. And
almost every Broadway house is booked; the Neil Simon is the major
exception, though ``Scarlet Pimpernel'' is likely to move there in
the fall, meaning that a spring rental would be limited.
</P>
<P>
   While reviews and public reaction may kill off some shows,
praying for another production's failure is considered super-bad
karma on Broadway. Still, producers are carefully watching box
office takes; the number of rumors about the coming demise of shows
from ``Titanic '' to ``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown'' pay
testament to the lust for a Broadway house. (Producers of these
shows say the rumors are unfounded.)
</P>
<P>
   For the producers of ``Fascinating Rhythm,'' who have sunk $4
million and seven years into getting the show to Broadway, just
getting there is victory enough. For now, that is.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be happy to be nominated and happy to win,'' Kladitis
said. ``But mostly we're happy because the show is right.''
</P>
<P>
   All That Fosse
</P>
<P>
   If there is a front-runner for best musical, it is ``Fosse,''
which has been quietly showing signs of becoming a bona fide hit.
</P>
<P>
   For the last month its gross sales have been growing, with
$534,032 sold last week out of a potential $624,925. The show has
been enjoying one of Broadway's top average ticket prices, a
barometer of the number of full-price, discount or free tickets
being offered. This comes during the winter sales slumps, and when
Livent, which is producing ``Fosse,'' is in bankruptcy proceedings
and cannot spend much on advertising, said Roy Furman, Livent's
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Names in ... Lights?
</P>
<P>
   What's in a name? Millions of dollars, or so the Roundabout
Theater Company hopes.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference last week to announce plans for a $17
million capital campaign for its new home at the Selwyn Theater,
the Roundabout unveiled a list of ``gift opportunities'' for
prospective donors. The list provides insight as to how nonprofit
theaters get much-needed cash.
</P>
<P>
   For a mere $10 million a donor could get his name on the
marquee, and on every ticket, press release and newsletter the
Roundabout issues. There's a cheaper kind of vanity plate, too. For
$350,000 a donor could have his name affixed to the orchestra pit,
though who beside the band would see it is anybody's guess.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular items, so far, are plaques on orchestra seats,
with about 40 sold so far, at a cool $5,000 each. Unsold are four
$75,000 bathrooms. ``It allows them to be remembered in
perpetuity,'' said Julia Levy, the theater's director of external
affairs. ``They can even put their name on their very own stall.''
</P>
<P>
   Say Uncle
</P>
<P>
   The dramarati may long debate this year's production of ``Death
of a Salesman.'' But today's critics have made at least one thing
certain: Howard Witt makes one heck of an Uncle Charley.
</P>
<P>
   Witt, 67, has worked as an actor in Chicago, Los Angeles and
other major cities since the mid-1950s, but has rarely been seen in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   He has had various meetings with ``Salesman.'' It was the first
show he ever saw, a tour version of the 1949 production. During his
20s, he played Biff Loman in Chicago, and in his 50s he played
Willy Loman in Kansas City. ``I milked every moment,'' he said. And
while his latest role is in support of Brian Dennehy's Willy, Witt
says he has enjoyed this production more than any other. One
special pleasure was meeting Arthur Miller, the playwright.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Miller, I've been an actor for 40 years. Could you
please give me a note?''' Witt said. ``And Miller said, `Don't
change a thing.'''

SHORT ITEMS ON WHAT IS NEW IN HOME VIDEO 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of the major films figuring in this year's Academy Awards
nominations, only two, ``The Truman Show'' and ``Primary Colors,''
are currently available on tape. Farther down the list of nominees,
however, at least one interesting video story is taking shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got about 500 collect calls,'' said Jonathan Stack, a
director and producer of ``The Farm: Angola, U.S.A.,'' an acclaimed
documentary about life at the notorious maximum-security prison at
Angola, La., and a nominee in the Documentary Feature category.
</P>
<P>
   Few of those calling collect from Angola will ever do otherwise;
in a state renowned for throwing away the key, 80 percent of the
prison's inmates die there.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Farm,'' six of them _ one who is about to be executed
and five others serving decades for a range of crimes from rape to
murder _ are poignant cases of men sentenced to death or, as Stack
puts it, death by incarceration.
</P>
<P>
   An award winner at the Sundance Film Festival and shown on cable
and in theaters last year, ``The Farm'' is to be released on
cassette by A&AMP;E on March 30. Stack, who is 41, has made 20
documentaries over a 10-year career.
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent of them, ``Damned in the U.S.A.,'' about arts
censorship, and ``Harlem Diary,'' in which youngsters were given
video cameras and asked to record their lives, had theater runs and
standard video releases.
</P>
<P>
   Stack's films typically are political and controversial. Most of
them went the way of small documentaries on video. ``I'd literally
make a list of colleges I thought might want to buy them,'' he
said. Sold copy by copy, the price would be $200 or $300.
</P>
<P>
   Marketed en masse by A&AMP;E, which financed the film and showed it
on television, ``The Farm'' video will cost $24.95, a price
obviously designed to encourage the sale of many more copies. Stack
sounds almost disappointed. ``It makes it impossible for me to
participate personally,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To him, mass audiences aren't the point. ``We don't need to
reach 20 million people to survive,'' he said, ``just enough who
care.'' Stack began making films in the late 80s, a time when
foundations were withdrawing support for documentaries and cable
companies were picking up the slack. Because his documentaries
weren't mainstream, he went to England for support. ``Damned in the
U.S.A.'', for example, was made for Channel 4 in England.
</P>
<P>
   Once his films have initial exposure on television, Stack seeks

   An international team of mercenaries is assembled to recover a

this kind of work.

   The others, especially the computer specialist and the weapons
man, bear watching, as does the shifty Irishwoman (Natascha
McElhone) who hires them. A master of spectacular action sequences,
John Frankenheimer renders a tightly plotted film that is, Janet
Maslin wrote in The New York Times, ``genuinely worldly and
unconventional.''

</P>

   In real life the drugged-out television writer Jerry Stahl
thrived through the 80s, being, as he put it, ``the `dark' guy who
took a little explaining but who got the job done.'' In David
Veloz's film, Stahl (Ben Stiller) is on a slide to rock bottom.
Along the way there is Sandra (Elizabeth Hurley), an ambitious,
high-powered Englishwoman who somewhat implausibly needs a
character like Jerry. But that's only one of the paradoxes in a
story that is ``as enveloping as it is darkly cautionary, thanks to
the effectively varied layers of Veloz's direction and the bitter
intensity Stiller brings to his central role''(Maslin). &QL;

   In high satirical form John Waters puts a loaded camera in the

him fire away at absolutely every banality he comes across on the
streets of Baltimore. Ballyhooed by an agent (Lilli Taylor), the
junk is soon celebrated in New York gallery circles, as are Pecker
and the real works of art in his life: his homegrown girlfriend
(Christina Ricci); his raucous sister (Martha Plimpton), who works
in a gay bar and calls everybody Mary, and his kindly mom (Mary Kay
Place), who runs a thrift shop and champions the homeless. All
would rather be in Baltimore in a film of ``ebulliently trashy
fun'' (Maslin). &QL;

   The miler Steve Prefontaine, who died in 1975 at age 24, might
not make obvious movie material. A record holder, he lost races on
occasion. A person with principles, he didn't trumpet them. He also
probably wouldn't have lived happily ever after. But Robert Towne's
film makes a compelling subject of the runner's relationship with
his renowned coach, the Nike founder Bill Bowerman (Donald
Sutherland), investing a curiously amorphous story with ``deep,
reflective power'' (Maslin).

   THE LAST EMPEROR. True, this is not a straight-to-video item,
but it is the director's cut of Bernardo Bertolucci's film about
Henry Pu Yi, the last Emperor of China, who was worshiped in
childhood and wound up a gardener during the Cultural Revolution in
the 1960s. About an hour has been added to the original film, which
won nine Oscars in 1987 and had a rerun in theaters in December.
That makes 3 hours 39 minutes all told, either panned-and-scanned
for $14.98 or wide-screen for $24.98 The DVD is $29.98. Artisan.
Release date: Feb. 23.

`JAWBREAKER': TEEN QUEENS OF MEAN, A SCREAM ON THE SCREEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frederick's of Hollywood gets a costume credit for making the
high school movie ``Jawbreaker'' safe for corsets and spike heels.
Candy colors, too, since the writer and director, Darren Stein,
sounds dead serious about garnishing his cheesecake with the
jawbreaker's metaphorical possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jawbreaker just came to represent the duality of the poppy
sweetness of the girls, of high school and of youth, versus the
whole idea that this thing could break your jaw,'' he has said.
``Once I thought of that, the rest of the screenplay poured out of
me in a week.''
</P>
<P>
   What poured out was a semi-satirical mix of pink-clawed
viciousness and girlie preening, the essential ingredients in half
the other teen-age movies around. Once again, the babes are
hot-looking predators obsessed with cruelty, popularity and
materialism, crushing all nerds and innocents in their way. But
since Stein borrows as much from John Waters as he does from the
nasty-schoolgirl classics (``Carrie,'' ``Grease,'' ``Heathers,''
``Clueless''), he opens his film with a half-jokey killing, too.
That gives his version an extra touch of tongue-in-cheek malice and
some timely references to the teen-horror romp.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the film's flouncing heroines puts it: ``That is so
not funny! Our best friend's dead!''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, a character briefly played by a former Miss
Teen-Age America (Charlotte Roldan) has expired after being
playfully bound, gagged and kidnapped by her fun-loving
girlfriends. Now she lies black and blue, fetchingly bruised, with
an unsightly lump in her neck caused by the large ball of candy
stuffed down her throat. Confronted with this nuisance, what are
the story's little she-monsters supposed to do?
</P>
<P>
   Not enough here that's new. Stein has a relatively mild taste
for parody (even though, to be fair, a satirist devoting himself to
teen-age films must find it harder and harder to beat the real
thing).
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Courtney Shayne (a gleefully carnal Rose McGowan) may
be the rottenest minx at Reagan High School, but that does not make
her a figure of endless fascination. Courtney savages friends and
enemies alike with a venomous glee that suggests Christina Ricci
doing a Bette Davis impersonation. Yet she's a one-note character
who shows few interesting kinks, even when cavorting with a
mysterious stranger she picks up in a bar. (Care to see Marilyn
Manson without his makeup? Here he is.)
</P>
<P>
   The friends of Courtney's who remain alive and halfway well are
Julie Freeman (Rebecca Gayheart), who dares to stop following
Courtney's marching orders, and Marcie Fox, Courtney's slavish
sidekick. (Marcie is played with amusing dizziness by Julie Benz,
who had one of the funniest scenes in ``As Good As It Gets'' when
she played the publishing house receptionist who cooed at Jack
Nicholson about his literary gifts.)
</P>
<P>
   But when their dirty little secret is in danger of being exposed
by Fern, the class dweeb (Judy Greer), they see trouble ahead. The
solution: remake Fern as a blond bombshell, instruct her in how to
be popular (``Don't ever, ever eat at lunch period _ do you
understand me?'') and hope that enough hot pink accessories will
keep her quiet. Of course, they create a monster. Of course, the
only way to resolve any of this is to do it shockingly at the
senior prom.
</P>
<P>
   As a nice break from the otherwise garish posturing of
``Jawbreaker,'' Pam Grier arrives to kick corset as the tough
police detective investigating the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Kane plays a schoolteacher with an all too Waters-ready
campiness, and some of the other casting involves veterans of
``Carrie'' and ``Grease.'' Meanwhile, in a film that showed enough
slick visual energy to turn up at this year's Sundance Film
Festival, Stein plays enthusiastically with every spinning circle
and candylike prop he can find. The film's bright look and visual
energy are much more liberating than the machinations of its teen
queens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jawbreaker'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent
or adult guardian). It includes profanity, brief sexual situations,
as much lewd gesturing as possible and one ha-ha sudden death.
</P>

THE LITERARY WORLD AM (AFTER MONICA)
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The big news in books this spring should be this: Finally, the
world will get the novel Ralph Ellison intended as his follow-up
(though not a sequel) to ``Invisible Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Between now and June, we'll also see new titles from significant
authors Salman Rushdie, Annie Dillard, Paul Auster and John Kenneth
Galbraith; bestseller-list fodder from Robert P. Parker, Danielle
Steel, Winston Groom, Martin Cruz Smith and Louis L'Amour; exciting
material from fresh literary faces including Christopher Moore,
Nathan Englander, Oonya Kempadoo and Melissa Bank; serious
nonfiction concerning J.P. Morgan, Alger Hiss, Robert Frost, Irving
Berlin, and Winston and Clementine Churchill; and, perhaps most
heartwarming of all, a comeback for poets: Robert Bly, Mary Oliver,
Allen Ginsberg.
</P>
<P>
   But these worthy books will probably be overshadowed by the
attention spewed out for just one title: ``Monica's Story'' by
Andrew Morton (St. Martin's Press, $24.95).
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's tale, as told to the same fellow who concocted
``Diana: Her True Story,'' will hit stores sometime in the next
couple of weeks. And whether or not ``Monica's Story'' tops the
bestseller list, for the next two years we're going to be inundated
with books about that presidential dalliance in the Oval Office.
Lewinsky is only the first to try to cash in with a book; major
writers, from Nora Ephron to Carl Bernstein, are working on their
own exposes.
</P>
<P>
   Although certain signs about the Lewinsky book are impossible to
mistake _ by hiring Morton, for instance, the publisher hopes to
link Lewinsky with beloved Princess Di _ it is not a given that
enough people will buy ``Monica's Story'' to earn back Lewinsky's
rumored $600,000 advance.
</P>
<P>
   And for those who can look beyond ``Monica's Story,'' here's a
month-by-month breakdown of this spring's prominent books:
</P>
<P>
   MARCH: In fiction, mysteries remain the genre of book-buyer
choice. Ruth Rendell and Robert B. Parker join the parade with
Rendell's ``A Sight for the Eyes'' (Crown, $24) and Parker's ``Hush
Money'' (Riverhead/Putnam, $22.95). The latter is the latest in
Parker's ``Spenser'' series.
</P>
<P>
   Other notable March fiction includes ``Little Green Men''
(Random House, $23.95), Christopher Buckley's book-length spoof of
America's obsession with space aliens; Winston Groom's ``Such a
Pretty, Pretty Girl'' (Random House, $23.95), about a woman so
beautiful men fall irrationally in love with her; ``Vittorio the
Vampire'' (Knopf, $19.95), Anne Rice's new bloodsucker yarn; and
``Dreamland'' (HarperCollins, $26), a much-touted novel by Kevin
Baker about an immigrant to America in 1909.
</P>
<P>
   Nonfiction titles to watch for are ``Betty Friedan: Her Life''
(Random House, $25), by Judith Hennessee; ``Winston &AMP; Clementine''
(Houghton Mifflin, $35), a collection of love letters edited by the
Churchills' surviving daughter, Mary Soames; ``The Courage to be
Rich'' (Putnam, $23), Suze Orman's follow-up to ``The 9 Steps to
Financial Freedom;'' and ``For the Time Being'' (Knopf, $22),
essays by Annie Dillard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Death &AMP; Fame: Last Poems 1993-1997'' concludes the published
works of beat poet Allen Ginsberg.
</P>
<P>
   APRIL: The most anticipated April release may be David
Guterson's ``East of the Mountains'' (Harcourt Brace, $25), the
latest novel from the author of the much-acclaimed ``Snow Falling
On Cedars.''
</P>
<P>
   Other fiction includes ``The Lust Lizard of Melancholy Cove''
(Spike/Avon, $23), new wacky mind candy from Christopher Moore;
Danielle Steel's ``Bittersweet'' (Delacorte, $26.95); a new Martha
Grimes mystery set in Santa Fe, ``Biting the Moon'' (Holt, $25);
``For the Relief of Unbearable Urges'' (Knopf, $23) by Nathan
Englander, reputed to be a new young master of the short story;
and, speaking of that genre, ``The Best American Short Stories of
the Century'' (Houghton Mifflin, $28) as selected by John Updike.
</P>
<P>
   Nonfiction picks are ``Morgan'' (Random House, $24.95), Jean
Strouse's look at J. Pierpont; ``Robert Frost: A Life'' (Holt, $35)
by Jay Perini, whose previous study of John Steinbeck received
critical raves; Edward Jablonski's ``Irving Berlin'' (Holt, $35);
and ``Dodger Blue'' (HarperCollins, $25), the reminiscences of
former Los Angeles Dodger manager Tommy Lasorda.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, there is ``Winter Hours'' (Houghton Mifflin, $22),
new poetry from Pultizer-winning Mary Oliver; ``The American
Century'' (Norton, $60), a stunning overview of art by Whitney
Museum curator Barbara Haskell; ``Eating the Honey of Words''
(Harper Flamingo, $20), poems from Robert Bly; ``The Passionate
Eye'' (Spike/Avon, $23), billed as ``the collected writings'' of
singer Suzanne Vega; and, winning all unofficial awards for best
title, actress Cybill Shepherd's ``Cybill Disobedience: How I
Survived Beauty Pageants, Elvis, Sex, Bruce Willis, Lies, Marriage,
Motherhood, Hollywood and the Irresistible Urge to Say What I
Think'' (HarperCollins, $25).
</P>
<P>
   MAY: Even before her first novel, ``Buxton Spice'' (Dutton,
$21.95), hits bookstores, Oonya Kempadoo is drawing comparisons to
Jamaica Kincaid. ``Buxton Spice'' is a classic girl-coming-of-age
novel set in Guyana; publishing industry gossip about the book is
uniformly positive.
</P>
<P>
   Also in May, Salman Rushdie returns with ``The Ground Beneath
Her Feet'' (Holt, $26), billed by its publisher as ``a tale of
love, death and rock 'n' roll.'' Louis L'Amour fans will
undoubtedly delight in ``Beyond the Great Snow Mountains'' (Bantam,
$16.95), a collection of short stories by the western author that
have not previously found their way into book format.
</P>
<P>
   But nonfiction otherwise dominates May. Freddie Mae Baxter's
``The Seventh Child'' (Knopf, $21) is an autobiography dealing with
life as a black woman. John Kenneth Galbraith offers history
lectures in ``From FDR On'' (Houghton Mifflin, $26), making
individual presidents his main topic. Longtime Washington reporter
Helen Thomas tackles the same subject in ``Front Row at the White
House'' (Scribner, $25).
</P>
<P>
   JUNE: The world has been waiting since 1952 and ``Invisible
Man'': Now, finally, there is Ralph Ellison's ``Juneteenth''
(Random House, $25). When Ellison died in 1994, he was still
revising this novel about a race-baiting U.S. senator who, on his
deathbed after an assassination attempt, summons a black preacher
to his side. The title refers to June 19, 1865, when word of the
Emancipation Proclamation reached enslaved blacks in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juneteenth'' will probably overshadow ``The View From Alger's
Window'' (Knopf, $24) by Tony Hiss. The author is the son of Alger
Hiss, and this perspective on the much-reviled individual should
prove especially illuminating.
</P>
<P>
   Also in June: ``Havana Bay'' (Random House, $25.95) is Martin
Cruz Smith's fourth Russian detective yarn featuring Arkady Renko.
Melissa Bank has gained a considerable reputation for
feminist-edged wit, and ``The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing''
(Viking, $23.95) shouldn't disappoint her fans.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Auster is widely considered one of America's finest
novelists, but his book sales have never matched his critical
acclaim. Maybe ``Timbuktu'' (Holt, $23) will put him over the top
in sales; it is a fabulously contorted tale told by Mr. Bones, a
dog accompanying owner Willy G. Christmas on a journey in search of
Willy's old English teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Enjoy June while you can. July will mark publication of the
first spate of post-impeachment books about Bill Clinton, Monica
Lewinsky, and the Scandal That Won't Go Away.

PREGANCY AND MOTHERHOOD AREN'T ROSIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``The 24-Hour Woman,'' Rosie Perez plays Grace, a TV
morning-show producer who becomes a procreator on the verge of a
nervous breakdown. Sharp and focused as a career woman, Grace is a
basket case as a new mother. For much of the film, Perez turns down
her trademark volume a notch or two, playing Grace with an atypical
confused sweetness. It's one of Perez's most likable performances,
if only because it's one of her least grating.
</P>
<P>
   Grace is likable because director/co-writer Nancy Savoca
(''Household Saints'') MAKES us like her; the deck is stacked in
her favor. Grace makes mistakes, but the movie argues that they're
not her fault, blaming them on external factors: her temperamental
baby, who defies all the advice Grace has received from child-care
experts; Grace's career-first boss (Patti LuPone), who resembles
Hitler in one scene; and especially Grace's clueless husband (Diego
Serrano), who co-hosts the talk show and has a budding career as an
action star. All of Grace's support comes from women, especially
her ultrapatient assistant (Marianne Jean-Baptiste of ``Secrets and
Lies''), who has three kids and a more supportive husband.
</P>
<P>
   Savoca, who directs with a loving eye for the messiness of real
life, structures the movie in three distinct acts: Grace's
pregnancy (which becomes a daily segment on the show), her first
few weeks as a mother, and a year later, around baby Lily's first
birthday. Despite some credibility-stretching situations, the first
two-thirds chug along fine before Savoca loses control in the
over-the-top third act, tossing real life out the window and
letting messiness take over. It's also where Perez loses control,
lapsing into the shrillness that's her hallmark; it's within
character, but that doesn't make it any less headache-inducing.
</P>
<P>
   The movie has enough perception about motherhood and clever
asides about morning TV shows and self-help gurus to make it worth
a look, but it's also calculated and, well, loud (although it
should probably be congratulated for sparing us the
rush-to-the-hospital/screaming-delivery-room scene). It plays like
a Lifetime made-for-TV movie with swear words and a better ethnic
mix, and its compact running time makes it a sure bet for a slot on
the cable channel down the road. At least there, you'll be able to
control the volume.

SENATORS CONSIDER MORE OVERSIGHT OF COSMETIC SURGERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ELIZABETH FERNANDEZ  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Infuriated by slick but deceptive cosmetic
surgery advertising and enraged by a mounting death toll, some
California senators vowed to toughen laws to better protect the
public from unscrupulous or poorly trained doctors.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing Wednesday, senators were told that existing
regulations are failing to protect patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I, for one, was shocked to find death rates as high as one in
5,000 for some of these procedures,'' said Sen. Liz Figueroa,
D-Hayward, head of the Senate Committee on Business and
Professions, which met in San Francisco. ``The lure of financial
rewards is turning the healing arts into a big business.''
</P>
<P>
   Figueroa said she planned to introduce legislation to ``to
establish fair and reasonable credentialing'' to assure a
physician's competence in doing cosmetic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Medical specialists testified that the monitoring mechanism
traditionally used by hospitals to pinpoint bad doctors does not
address the growing number of physicians who work in office-based
clinics. About 60 percent of medical procedures today occur in such
clinics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is currently no system for assuring surgeon
qualification,'' Figueroa said. ``This has to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Sen. Jackie Speier, D-South San Francisco, said
she was considering a bill to restrict the amount of liposuction
that could be performed on a patient. One of the nation's most
popular cosmetic procedures, liposuction has been linked to as many
as 100 deaths out of 110,000 procedures performed in the United
States in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Some patients have bled to death a few hours after the surgery,
others have died days or weeks later from complications, such as
infection, abdominal perforations, loss of blood or embolism,
medical authorities say.
</P>
<P>
   Speier railed against ``weekend warriors (who) watch a video,''
then consider themselves fat-extraction experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Liposuction is putting people, particularly women, at risk,''
Speier said in an interview. ``We have to put the brakes on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a special committee of the Medical Board of
California recommended a moratorium on so-called mega-liposuction
outside hospitals until safety concerns could be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Urging tighter accrediting standards in general, Speier
lambasted misleading ads used to entice patients into all manner of
body improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Assemblyman Martin Gallegos, D-Baldwin Park,
proposed legislation to make malpractice insurance mandatory for
doctors performing plastic surgery outside hospitals. His bill also
would require cosmetic surgery complications to be reported to the
medical board and would outlaw doctors keeping patients overnight
in their clinics without sufficient equipment or staffing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no health benefit to cosmetic surgery,'' noted Dr.
Robert del Junco, a consultant to the medical board's committee and
a tireless crusader for changes.
</P>
<P>
   While additional regulations would not guarantee patient safety
because ``you can't legislate good judgment on the part of a
physician,'' said Dr. Angelo Capozzi, president of the California
Society of Plastic Surgeons, more guidelines would ``reduce the
number of cases where people will be hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a San Francisco Examiner series, ``Skin Deep,''
highlighted the problems and abuses of cosmetic surgery.

`FLEA' CONQUERS THE SURF AT MAVERICKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE GANAHL  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRINCETON-BY-THE-SEA, Calif. _ At the end of the long and
grueling day, it took a Flea to conquer a mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl ``Flea'' Virostko, 27, a surfer from Santa Cruz with a
strange nickname and an even stranger hairstyle _ bleached platinum
with dark leopard spots _ earned a place in surfing history by
winning the first Men Who Ride Mountains contest Wednesday at
Mavericks, the surf spot known for its enormous, deadly waves.
</P>
<P>
   Virostko, one of only 20 surfers invited to compete in the
event, thrilled both spectators and judges with a wicked drop-in on
one of the biggest waves of the day _ possibly a 25-footer. He
caught an updraft and became airborne as he descended, then caught
his balance and finished the ride smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   For his courage and technique, Virostko was given first prize,
which was to have been $10,000 but was upped to $15,000 by
Quiksilver USA, the contest sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of camaraderie out there,'' said Virostko,
looking a bit embarrassed by the glare of cameras. ``A wave would
come, and they'd all shout, `You got it! You got it!'''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he got his nickname, Virostko said Vince Collier,
another competitor from Santa Cruz, had given it to him when he was
young. ``He said I looked so tiny on a wave I could have been a
flea.''
</P>
<P>
   As if on cue, Collier, 38, interrupted in a booming voice at the
back of the press conference: ``Ladies and gentleman, Flea
Virostko!'' And the Santa Cruz contingent erupted with riotous
applause.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Collier declared that given Virostko's skills at both
acrobatic and big-wave surfing, ``He's probably the best surfer in
the world right now _ not just Santa Cruz.''
</P>
<P>
   The day did belong to surfers from ``the Cruz,'' who took five
of the top seven spots. Coming in second was Richard Schmidt, 38,
of Santa Cruz; third was Ross Clarke Jones, 32, of Australia;
fourth was Peter Mel, 29, of Santa Cruz; fifth was Jay Moriarity,
at 20 the youngest competitor, from Santa Cruz; sixth was Josh
Loya, 30, of Santa Cruz; and seventh was Brock Little, 31, of
Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the surfers invited to compete were over 40.
</P>
<P>
   The only criteria used to determine who would get the coveted
invitation? ``Experience,'' said contest director Jeff Clark.
``Whether they've surfed a lot of big waves, it's a whole different
ball game than what most contests call for.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a tiny fraction of all surfing enthusiasts want to
challenge themselves by surfing waves that are potentially lethal.
A tinier fraction than that want to take on the likes of Mavericks.
Until five years ago, Mavericks was a secret spot, known only to a
few. But it's now considered among the top big wave spots on the
planet _ up there with Todos Santos in Baja California, the North
Shore of Oahu, and J-Bay in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks also is known as possibly the most dangerous surfing
spot in the world, partly because of its proximity to huge rocks
planted in the lineup, and also because of the sheer volume of
water that rises up when the mighty Pacific meets the reef half a
mile from Pillar Point some time between November and March. Heavy,
green and opaque, it's a wave that really does look like a
mountain.
</P>
<P>
   The danger of the place was brought home in 1994, when a huge
swell came up just before Christmas, drawing surfers from around
the world. Included in that group was Mark Foo, a celebrity
Hawaiian surfer with his own TV show and world renown. Before the
end of his first day at Mavericks, he was dead, after probably
hitting his head during a fairly routine wipeout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, Mark's death was a reminder that we should never take
this place for granted,'' said Clark, shaking his head.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Remarkable, isn't it, what a woman of style can do
with a simple straitjacket. In Paula Vogel's new play, ``The
Mineola Twins,'' Swoosie Kurtz models this classic piece of attire
with a panache that could only stir envy in the runway walkers
strutting through Fashion Week in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Playing a proper Long Island housewife, as she appears to
herself in a nightmare, Ms. Kurtz unfurls the confining jacket's
long arms to perform a dance of fiendish, glint-eyed glee. A pair
of hitherto thuglike hospital attendants can't resist joining in,
and Ms. Kurtz, resembling a cross between Isadora Duncan and the
Bride of Frankenstein, twirls her sleeves into arcs and circles,
her bootee-slippered feet tripping ever more lightly. You half
expect her to go flying over the audience, and the wicked,
power-giddy smile on her face promises that she could, if she
wanted to.
</P>
<P>
   That's only a dream, of course. The sororal title characters of
Ms. Vogel's comedy, both deliciously played by Ms. Kurtz, spend
their waking hours fully, if not literally, straitjacketed: by
sexual stereotypes, societal expectations and a soul-strangling
hatred for each other. Squabbling, plotting and avenging themselves
through four decades of American life, Myra and Myrna of Mineola
are never much more than the sums of their slogans and fashion
accessories.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vogel's play, which opened Thursday night at the Laura Pels
Theater at the Roundabout, is willfully confined to two dimensions,
to the sensibility of an animated political cartoon. Those who know
this dramatist only from her Pulitzer Prize-winning ``How I Learned
to Drive,'' which examined pedophilia with a startling and
affecting lyricism, may have difficulty recognizing her voice here.
</P>
<P>
   In manipulating cultural cliches, the play doesn't necessarily
rise above them. Many of its jokes are at least as old as the first
season of ``Saturday Night Live.'' Though Ms. Vogel arranges
familiar material into some illuminating patterns, much of her
gender-twisting satire would undoubtedly seem stale to downtown
audiences who have sat through more advanced variations on the same
themes by performers like Lypsinka and the Five Lesbian Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   The effort the production puts into making the play's effigies
of characters breathe generates some tasty treats. The director,
Joe Mantello (``Love! Valour! Compassion!,''
``Mizlansky/Zilinsky''), resourcefully turns the evening into a
sort of pop hymn to the transforming powers of theater, in which
even costume changes become charming sleight-of-hand acts.
</P>
<P>
   The four supporting cast members, who include the protean Mo
Gaffney as Myrna's high school boyfriend and the middle-aged Myra's
lesbian lover, give off a corresponding sense of actorly discipline
mixed with actorly self-delight, that glow of concentration and
triumph you see in magicians successfully plying their illusions.
Then there is, of course, Ms. Kurtz, who gets to show off the
highly refined comic exaggeration that first made her name in the
New York theater and that is rarely seen in her more naturalistic
work in films and television.
</P>
<P>
   Like the baffling twins of fairy tales and the identical cousins
of ``The Patty Duke Show,'' Myra and Myrna look just the same
(except for breast size) and couldn't behave more differently.
First seen as high school students in the 1950s, the sisters keep
squaring off in ways befitting the changing times: as school tramp
versus virginal teen queen; as counter-cultural radical versus
status-quo-worshiping housewife; as abortion rights spokeswoman
versus right-wing radio talk show hostess.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vogel's script is most ingenious in demonstrating what these
antithetical siblings have in common as time goes by. Both become
terrorists, though of different stripes; both spend time in prison;
both turn out to be neglectful parents of sons (both played wittily
by Mandy Siegfried) who despise their mothers and adore their
aunts. The sisters' opposition, neatly representing the schism
between right and left in the United States, is self-destructive,
and each subliminally longs for connection with the other.
</P>
<P>
   In tracing this schematic outline, Ms. Vogel comments on a world
in which rules hem in women while there are, as Myrna says with
placid acceptance, ``no absolutes for guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The comic dialogue in which these rules are summoned is often
standard issue, bringing to mind a burlesque version of those
era-spanning novels with a feminist conscience, like Lisa Alther's
``Kinflicks.'' (Myrna to the lustful Jim: ``You've been reading
Hefner again, haven't you?'')
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kurtz, however, consistently scores personal points off
familiar archetypes, bringing devilish spark to both the
flat-chested Myra and the missile-breasted Myrna. Watch her, for
example, as the prim teen-age Myra, idly patting her lust-addled
boyfriend's rump as if he were a Labrador retriever while
perfunctorily saying, ``I want you badly.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gaffney and Ms. Siegfried bring dead-on drollery and
restraint to their various incarnations. It's a joy to watch them
assuming new identities in a danced change of costumes and wigs,
assisted by Daniel Sherman and Jimmy Holder, who stylishly portray
the male equivalents of the cheesecake assistants in old variety
shows.
</P>
<P>
   The perfect-pitch caricature costumes are by Jess Goldstein, and
since this is a play in which coiffure is character, one should
also mention the adroit hair styling of Bobby Miller.
</P>
<P>
   The arch, zippy sets, by Robert Brill and Scott Pask, find the
``Twilight Zone'' element in period Americana, while David Van
Tieghem's sound effects wryly suggest a subliminal spirit of sci-fi
terror.
</P>
<P>
   While Mantello and his cast keep the play skipping blithely
along, they also occasionally crack its shiny exterior to reveal a
profound anxiety. In the work's opening scene, a dream sequence,
Myra discovers herself in an infernal version of her high school
homeroom where she is asked to come up with ``the hypotenuse of
hygiene.''
</P>
<P>
   As the nightmare spins itself out, fears of nuclear attack,
sexual predation and familial estrangement meld in a way that
haunts even as it teases. The rest of ``The Mineola Twins'' never
digs as convincingly beneath its own surface. Even this cast and
this production, as good as any playwright could hope for, can't
give a third dimension to Ms. Vogel's sparring paper dolls.
</P>

A MUSEUM GIFT OF PHOTOGRAPHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To encourage collectors to donate art to museums, directors and
curators are always exploring creative ways to make giving
appealing. One approach taken by the San Francisco Museum of Modern
Art attracted a group of 1,000 photographs to the institution
recently.
</P>
<P>
   The gift, from the San Francisco real estate investor Paul Sack
and his wife, Prentice, was made by forming the Prentice and Paul
Sack Photographic Trust, an organization set up to benefit the
museum's photography program.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as we can tell, we're the first American institution to
use the notion of a supporting organization,'' said David A. Ross,
director of the museum. ``It allows the Sacks to remain actively
involved in the collection.''
</P>
<P>
   It also gives the couple a tax deduction equal to the full
appraised value of the photographs, museum officials said; this is
a larger tax break than if they had donated the collection as a
partial or promised gift.
</P>
<P>
   By establishing a trust whose board consists of Sack, Ross and
Sandra S. Phillips, the museum's director of photography, the Sacks
and the museum are sharing in the care, exhibition and growth of
the collection.
</P>
<P>
   The Sacks plan to continue collecting and may give more
photographs to the trust, but the trust itself is not meant to be a
collecting organization. All the photographs that make up its
assets, however, will be available to the museum for exhibition,
study, loan and preservation.
</P>
<P>
   The collection, which experts say is worth about $5 million,
spans the history of photography from British Victorian documentary
work through the 20th century. Sack's first purchase, Walker Evans'
``New York, South Street (Paul's Restaurant),'' from 1933, is in
the collection. There are also works by Diane Arbus, Louis de Cler,
Dora Maar and others.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning on March 27, the museum will show about 60 photographs
from the collection as part of its rotating photography exhibition,
``Picturing Modernity.''
</P>
<P>
   Since its founding in 1935, the San Francisco Museum of Modern
Art has had an exceptional photography collection, in part because
of Northern California's history as a home and an inspiration for
photographers. Among those who lived and worked there were Ansel
Adams, Edward Weston and Carlton Watkins. Photography is the one
part of the museum's collection that includes the 19th century,
Ross said. ``It begins to explore the concept that modernism began
with photography.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum also recently received 11 photographs by Charles
Sheeler, the American Precisionist artist. They were bought with
donations from several museum supporters. Ten are duplicate prints
that belonged to Robert Lane, a collector who had purchased
Sheeler's estate and who died four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   These works range from Sheeler's studies of vernacular
architecture in Bucks County, Pa., to 1927 factory images for the
Ford Motor Co. at River Rouge, Mich. The 11th Sheeler image is from
1929.
</P>
<P>
   The works are in the exhibition ``Native Modern: Charles Sheeler
and Precisionism,'' which opened Thursday and runs through April
27. Eureka!
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the oldest surviving copy of the important mathematical
works of Archimedes sold at Christie's in New York this fall for
$2.2 million, the buyer was a low-profile American collector who
wished to remain anonymous. So mathematicians, historians,
scientists and scholars thought they would never see the Archimedes
palimpsest again.
</P>
<P>
   But this week the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore announced
that it would show the manuscript in a special exhibition from June
20 through Sept. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Vikan, director of the Walters, had contacted Simon Finch,
the London dealer who bought the manuscript on behalf of the
collector. It turned out that the new owner was a supporter of the
Walters.
</P>
<P>
   Vikan, who is a Byzantine scholar, said the Walters was the
right place to show the work by Archimedes, the Greek mathematician
and inventor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the largest manuscript collection of any museum in the
country,'' he said. ``It's a bit like having Archimedes' brain in a
box.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the manuscript is delicate, scientists at nearby Johns
Hopkins University will digitize the images so they can be more
throughly viewed. ``We're going to do an audiovisual film to tell
the story of Archimedes,'' Vikan said, ``to tell about the
transition of classical knowledge to modern times.''
</P>
<P>
   A palimpsest is a parchment or other writing surface that has
been used more than once, so that the earlier writing is only
partly visible. The 174-page Archimedes palimpsest is the only
manuscript containing the mathematician's ``Method of Mechanical
Theorems'' and the original Greek version of ``On Floating
Bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   Copied during the 10th century by a scribe in Constantinople,
the text of Archimedes' theories was washed off in the 12th century
by monks so that the parchment could be re-used. Digital technology
makes it possible to read beneath the monks' writing, revealing
Archimedes' text and geometrical diagrams.
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Lannan Foundation, a $225 million nonprofit organization
based in Los Angeles, keeps changing the way it supports the arts.
Two years ago it ended its exhibitions program and began dispersing
its collection to major museums. Now the foundation is taking a
yearlong hiatus from grant making to review its programs for
contemporary visual art, literary arts and indigenous communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt it was time to review our process and possibly
restructure our grant program,'' said Kathleen M. Merrill, director
of the art program. ``By the end of this year we will be able to
publicize new grant guidelines and procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation was started by J. Patrick Lannan, a Chicago
financier and collector, in 1960. Since its grants program began in
1986, it has awarded more than $70 million, supported 400 projects
by 200 arts organizations and financed exhibitions, publications
and residency programs.
</P>
<P>
   It has also given more than 500 modern and contemporary works
from its collection to 25 American museums. It still has about 300
works to give away.

   Dowries _ the property that a bride's family gives her husband
upon the marriage _ are the subject of a new exhibition at the
Mingei International Museum of Folk Art in San Diego. Focusing on
dowries in Eastern Europe, the show offers an intimate view of
domestic life in the region from the 1850s to World War II, with
some fascinating anthropology thrown in.
</P>
<P>
   The show, which runs through May, has a full range of the
hand-woven textiles that young girls labored over for years for
their trousseaus; they don't call it a hope chest for nothing.
Included are 30 pieces of painted furniture, which was often part
of a dowry; photographs of such furniture can be seen in ``Painted
Furniture'' by Nancy Schiffer (Schiffer Publishing), out this year.
</P>
<P>
   The textiles are from the collection of Helene Baine Cincebeaux
and her mother, Helen Zemek Baine, who traveled to remote villages
in Slovakia, Moravia and Bohemia in the 1960s and '70s in search of
wedding crowns, bed hangings, shawls and christening gowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women would invite us home and open their cupboards to us,''
Mrs. Cincebeaux said. ``Everything would be there, even the dress
they wanted to be buried in. Each village had its customs. These
were ceremonial textiles. There were birthing cloths that would be
hung with garlic to ward off evil spirits and christening cloths
that signified, `We're taking away a pagan and bringing back a
Christian.'''
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Corbett, guest curator of the San Diego show, said:
``Women gave Helene their prized wedding crowns, bed curtains and
dowry clothes because they thought they might be appreciated in
America. They said that brides today don't want to be married in
traditional costumes.''
</P>
<P>
   A custom that long predates Cleopatra, the dowry is found in
societies from Asia to Africa to Europe. The amount of a woman's
dowry once determined her marriageability.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Corbett, who has studied wedding rituals, said that in
Romania, the wedding would begin with the bride's formal
leave-taking of her family. The bride would ask for the family's
blessing; family members would dress her in a crown and shawl.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Kelly, an art professor at Tompkins Cortland Community
College in Dryden, N.Y., who gave a paper at a recent symposium on
dowries at the Mingei, said, ``The elaborately embroidered shawl
protected the bride during the wedding ceremony, in the time
between her virginal life and married life.''
</P>
<P>
   She pointed out that many shawls have symbols of fertility and
protection. ``Shawls often have a red zigzag line along the edge,
like rickrack,'' Ms. Kelly said. ``This is a protection motif
called wolves' teeth. A pagan goddess with raised hands also
protects the bride.
</P>
<P>
   ``You also see Christian and pre-Christian symbols together,''
she continued. ``A chalice represents the church while tulips and
pomegranates represent fertility. Birds, because they live in the
air between heaven and earth, are pre-Christian symbols of holiness
and spirituality.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Corbett explained that after the bride left her family's
house for the last time, she would walk down the village's main
street, accompanied by a brass band. ``She would wear her wedding
crown and a lace head scarf,'' Ms. Corbett said. ``After the
ceremony, the crown was removed and she donned the headdress of a
married woman. She could never be seen bareheaded again.''
</P>
<P>
   The painted furniture in the show is on loan from Margaret and
Bill Pearson of Kingston, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Pearson, 78, was a jockey for 40 years. In the 1950s he won both
``The $64,000 Question'' and ``The $64,000 Challenge.'' His
expertise? Art. He said he had once raced horses all over the
world. On his travels, he collected antiques.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought a hundred pieces of painted furniture in Budapest
when I lived there in the 1980s,'' he said. ``They are wildly
decorative pieces that speak to all of us.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Corbett said items in his collection were dated from 1848 to
World War II, when this kind of furniture stopped being made. ``We
know it's dowry furniture because the painting is so ornate,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``The pieces are dated and have the names of the
bride and groom on them. They were commissioned by the bride's
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the furniture is from two towns where German immigrants
settled in the 18th century _ Harta, 125 miles south of Budapest,
and Komarom, in what is now Slovakia. ``Harta was a center where
German immigrants settled and made furniture,'' Ms. Corbett said.
``You'll note all the writing is in German Gothic script.''
</P>
<P>
   Slovaks in Komarom were making wedding wardrobes and chests as
far back as the 16th century, Ms. Corbett said. ``They were painted
with tulips, carnations and urns, which are meant to bring
fertility, good harvests and prosperity,'' she said. ``It's the
same vocabulary you see on the linens. You even see the wolves'
teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   Dowry furniture always remained in the possession of the bride.
``They were her certificate of deposit,'' Ms. Corbett said.
</P>
<P>
   One good source for such furniture is International Country of
Albertville, Minn. Tim Franke, one of the owners, said: ``We
currently have 115 Eastern European blanket chests and 35 painted
wardrobes. We do 80 shows a year, all over the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Antique Eastern European textiles and vintage clothing are sold
at Golyester, a store at 136 South La Brea Avenue in Los Angeles.
Prices range from $125 to $2,500. The owner, Esther Ginsberg, also
has a by-appointment gallery of museum-quality pieces that start at
$1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Among richer families, land was included in a bride's dowry;
such a dowry was more of a conditional gift meant to keep a husband
in line. If it failed _ say, if the husband disgraced his wife _
the land was to be restored to her.
</P>
<P>
   In the 12th century, married women in Germany who were
mistreated could honorably retreat to a nunnery connected to a
monastery. The women's dowry lands would be automatically annexed
to the monastery, but not the nunnery.
</P>
<P>
   That changed in about 1150, when the extraordinary nun and
mystic Hildegard of Bingen demanded that her local monastery at
Rupertsberg not withhold from once-married nuns the lands given as
their dowries. Hildegard got a list of the properties and persuaded
the chief monk to let her nunnery control them. In one move, she
made her nunnery self-supporting.
</P>
<P>
   Hildegard may have been known as ``the Sybil of the Rhine'' _
she was an accomplished composer whose music is now available on
CDs _ but she was no feminist. She just wanted her new nuns to get
their due.
</P>
<P>
   Whether a dowry is 100 acres or a four-poster bed, it may still
be a woman's best friend.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The mezzo-soprano Jennifer Larmore, who is singing
her debut performances with the New York Philharmonic this weekend,
has a simple explanation for the seeming abundance of singers in
her vocal category these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have always been good mezzos,'' she said recently.
``It's just that nobody paid attention to them before.''
</P>
<P>
   She referred not only to the golden era of mezzos in the decades
before and after World War II, when Ebe Stignani, Rise Stevens,
Giulietta Simionato and other great artists were active, but also
to the decades of her youth, as a baby boomer from Atlanta, when
the indomitable Marilyn Horne, the elegant Frederica von Stade and
the versatile Regina Resnik, among others, were doing their best
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, mezzos were stuck in less-than-glamorous
roles,'' Ms. Larmore said, all those character parts that Maureen
Forrester used to dub ``mothers, maids, witches and bitches.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Ms. Larmore believes, largely thanks to the talent and
determination of Ms. Horne, a whole repertory of heroic, comic and
memorable bel canto roles for mezzos was revived and became
popular. Ms. Larmore is noted for her technically adroit and
vocally lustrous portrayals of such roles, especially Rossini's
Isabella, Rosina, Arsace and Cenerentola.
</P>
<P>
   So it was not surprising when her Teldec recording last year of
Rossini arias, ``Amore per Rossini,'' with the English Chamber
Orchestra, was nominated for a Grammy Award recently in the Best
Classical Vocal category.
</P>
<P>
   But, to Ms. Larmore's frustration, in her own country, she is
mostly known as a Rossini specialist and champion of Baroque opera,
including the daunting title role in Handel's ``Giulio Cesare,''
which she will sing at the Metropolitan Opera in April. In Europe,
where Ms. Larmore's early career was nurtured, she has been heard
in a significantly wider repertory, including weighty German music
like Schoenberg's massive ``Gurrelieder,'' an early work steeped in
Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   So, her performances this weekend with the New York Philharmonic
will help, she hopes, change her perceived identity in her native
country. She will sing in Mahler's ``Das Lied von der Erde,'' with
Richard Leech as the tenor soloist, and Kurt Masur conducting.
There are not many Rossini mezzos around today who would undertake
this far-afield work.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly no one could imagine Cecilia Bartoli, a Rossini
superstar, singing Mahler or Schoenberg. Ms. Larmore frequently has
been compared to Ms. Bartoli, most notably in 1997, when the Met
mounted its first production of Rossini's ``Cenerentola'' for the
Italian mezzo and asked Ms. Larmore to take over the title role
later in the run.
</P>
<P>
   They are quite different artists. At 32, Ms. Bartoli sings with
a fresh, gleaming radiance, sparkling vitality and insightful
musicianship. Now 40, Larmore has a duskier, larger and more
penetrating sound. Though proud of her ``brilliant, full high C,''
Ms. Larmore says that nobody would want to hear her high D.
</P>
<P>
   But she has a seemingly inborn facility for coloratura flights
that emerged uninstructed when she was 14. Her work is further
enriched by dramatic depth, where called for, and, here and there,
a touch of rather sly Southern charm. These qualities charged her
portrayal of Cenerentola at the Met, which The New York Times
critic James R. Oestreich described as ``a vocal tour de force
worthy to stand alongside anyone's.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was very gratifying,'' Ms. Larmore said, with disarming
sincerity. ``But I think Cecilia is wonderful and we like each
other. We sang together in `Cosi Fan Tutte' at the Salzburg
Festival in 1993, and laughed over coffee in a cafe one day about
the battle everyone thinks we are engaged in.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bartoli achieved her first great success in the United
States, while Ms. Larmore had to go early on to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   She grew up the youngest of four children, and her parents took
her almost weekly to the Atlanta Symphony, then in its heyday under
the late Robert Shaw. ``I sang with the symphony under Shaw as part
of the All-State Chorus,'' she said. ``I grew up with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Larmore eschewed a conservatory for the less high-powered
atmosphere of Westminster Choir School in Princeton, N.J., where
students were prepared for sensible careers as public school
teachers and church choir directors. But when she graduated, Ms.
Larmore realized that teaching children do-re-mi was not for her.
</P>
<P>
   She worked for three intensive years with John Bullock, a vocal
pedagogue in Arlington, Va., supporting herself as a sales girl in
a local gourmet shop. Then, while participating in the Spoleto
Festival in Italy in 1980, she met William Powers, a bass-baritone
17 years her senior. She was 22. Two years later they were married.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill was already in the business,'' she said. ``So he knew a
lot about life. He cherished me, protected me, counseled me.
Because of him, I have the career I have today.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Larmore felt ready to enter the field professionally,
she sang three auditions in Manhattan on the same day, for
companies in Augusta, Ga.; Syracuse, N.Y., and Nice, France,
assuming that her best shot would be in the United States. Only
Nice came through, offering her a debut in 1986, in Mozart's
``Clemenza di Tito.''
</P>
<P>
   Singing in the repertory houses of Europe was once virtually the
only way an American could commence a career. Today, American
companies like to think they are taking care of their own, but Ms.
Larmore's experience proves otherwise. Still, she does not regret
her early European trajectory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned the languages and the cultures,'' she said. ``I got
them in my body. Opera was born in Europe. If you want to study
opera, you go there; if you want to play baseball, you must come
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Major roles followed quickly, including her first appearances as
Rosina in ``Il Barbiere di Siviglia'' in Lyons and Strasbourg.
Then, Nice called again, offering Giovanna Seymour in Donizetti's
``Anna Bolena,'' a role with a punishingly high tessitura, and Ms.
Larmore learned, the hard way, of the need to say no.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to do the roles that my heroes, like Shirley Verrett,
were doing,'' she said. ``I accepted. I could do it now. But then
it was a mistake.'' The production was cumbersome; the music too
demanding, and the stress unbearable. She lost 25 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, she has made expansive, challenging, but appropriate
repertory choices, not just in opera, but in concert works and
recital fare. In 1995 alone, for example she performed Rosina for
her Met debut; sang Mahler's ``Rueckert Lieder'' at the Musikverein
in Vienna; recorded ``Carmen'' in Munich under Giuseppe Sinopoli,
and sang Schoenberg's ``Gurrelieder'' in Dresden.
</P>
<P>
   Her approach to Mahler's great ``Das Lied von Der Erde''
suggests that she has found a way to make such substantive Germanic
repertory her own. The orchestral song cycle, based on German
translations of a set of Chinese poems (``The Chinese Flute''), is
essentially a symphony for full orchestra with two vocal soloists.
</P>
<P>
   Written in the aftermath of the death in 1907 of Mahler's eldest
daughter, aged 4, and the stunning news of his own heart condition,
which would eventually prove fatal, ``Das Lied'' is a transcendent,
and at times, hauntingly exotic score. It ends with a farewell to
life, ``Der Abschied,'' a song for lower voice (Ms. Larmore in the
Philharmonic's performance) of some 30 minutes, nearly equal in
length to the previous five songs combined.
</P>
<P>
   ``The music must sound like an explosion in a bottle,'' Ms.
Larmore said. ``You must keep it restrained, and not wallow in it.
Also, I do not find it to be all that sad. That's a mistake some
people make.''
</P>
<P>
   When, in a passage of melancholic simplicity, with the voice
accompanied only by flute, the poem states, ``I stand here waiting
for my friend; I wait to bid him a last farewell,'' Ms. Larmore
believes that the sentiment should be one of almost joyful
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   During the first piano rehearsal with Masur on Tuesday, Ms.
Larmore was nervous, she admitted. ``I had never laid eyes on him
before,'' she said. It may have prodded her to sing with too much
sound at first, she said. ``I was thinking about the poetry and
really getting into it. Then Masur stopped and smiled, and said,
very tactfully, `There is no need; I am sure you can be
understated.' I was sure too. It worked beautifully.''
</P>
<P>
   Masur believes that those who assume that Mahler's vocal works
with orchestra call for dramatic-sized voices, and that even Ms.
Larmore's penetrating sound is not hefty enough, are completely
mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing for this music,'' he said, ``is for the
singer to convey what the message of the poetry is. In `Der
Abschied,' there are long passages for voice that are almost a
cappella. I sometimes hear it with a huge voice. But if the voice
has no ability to change colors and expression, it can be very
boring. Ms. Larmore is very intelligent, very musical, and she will
catch the piece honesty and believably, I am sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Ms. Larmore is now excited about her Giulio Cesare at the
Met, her only other New York engagement this spring, she hesitated
at first when offered the part.
</P>
<P>
   ``I adore this opera, but I felt the Met was too big a house for
Baroque music,'' she said. ``I had done it in perfect situations,
those little jewel-box opera houses and concert halls in Europe.
But then I told myself, `Don't be such a snob. You don't say no
when the Met offers you a chance to sing Giulio Cesare.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Larmore always has enjoyed playing authoritative, hot-headed
male characters like this one. ``And the male costumes are more
comfortable,'' she added. ``No high heels.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Larmore's repertory explorations continue. Carmen was one
touchstone role she had long coveted, and recorded, but never
performed on stage. That changed this fall when she portrayed
everyone's favorite Gypsy temptress at the Los Angeles Opera, with
Placido Domingo as her Don Jose in several performances.
</P>
<P>
   Now she has her sights on Adalgisa in Bellini's ``Norma,'' and,
most of all, Strauss' Octavian. She dreams of singing Octavian with
two good friends: Renee Fleming as the Marschallin, and Sylvia
McNair as Sophie, an all-American ``Rosenkavalier'' team to follow
in the tradition of Ms. Stevens, Eleanor Steber and Teresa
Stich-Randall.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Larmore should get her wish, for mezzos have new-found
clout. ``We are finally coming to the forefront,'' she said. ``But
this is not a competition. One thing I always tell young students
when they ask for advice: Aim high, but remember, there is plenty
of room for everybody.'' &QL;

SARGENT'S SPONTANEOUS DAZZLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ We all want to do something, almost anything, as
adeptly as John Singer Sargent handled a paintbrush. From the 1880s
nearly until the start of World War I, by which point he had pretty
much given up portraiture, he was the most skillful society painter
on either side of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Skill, of course, is not depth of feeling, but let's admit its
appeal. And when you're dealing with skill on this level, its
appeal becomes nearly erotic.
</P>
<P>
   There's a quick sensual charge in the big Sargent retrospective
opening on Sunday at the National Gallery and in the smaller
companion show of a few dozen of his drawings at the Corcoran
Gallery. It derives entirely from the surface pleasure of his
pictures. You wouldn't call it love, exactly, but it's not bad.
</P>
<P>
   Americans claim Sargent as part of the national heritage,
although we've always been uneasy about him. We're cultural
moralists; he wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   He was hardly an American, having been born and reared in
Europe. His father was a doctor who gave up his comfortable
Philadelphia practice to accommodate his wife's wanderlust.
</P>
<P>
   They moved around Europe, from one hotel or rented villa to
another. Sargent lived everywhere and nowhere until settling in
Paris and then, ultimately, in London. He didn't even visit America
until he was 21.
</P>
<P>
   Partly this may explain why he has always seemed in his art to
be observing a world that he neither occupied nor chose to judge.
His pictures are, in a sense, amoral, which made him the perfect
portraitist for the Gilded Age.
</P>
<P>
   Pushed, perhaps, by competition with the growing medium of
photography, and prodded by ranks of the newly rich, portraiture at
the turn of the century edged toward ever greater extremes of
mannerist flamboyance and sycophancy, for which Sargent, having
arrived on the scene at the start of the Belle Epoque, was
temperamentally suited and well trained.
</P>
<P>
   He had worked in the Paris studio of the portraitist
Carolus-Duran, who provided him with a role model: an artist making
a lucrative career between academic orthodoxy and mild radicalism.
Carolus-Duran exhorted his students to paint not from drawings, as
the academics taught, but directly onto a blank canvas with a
loaded brush. The goal was to affect spontaneity and swiftness.
</P>
<P>
   Velazquez, the virtuoso of immediacy, was Carolus-Duran's god,
as he became for Sargent and for modernists like Manet, so there
was perhaps a whiff of rebellion by association about
Carolus-Duran's admiration for Velazquez. That said, what
Carolus-Duran wanted to cultivate in his students was not the same
sort of spontaneity that the modernists were aiming at. It had much
more to do with pure pyrotechnics.
</P>
<P>
   You can see in the earliest drawings in the Corcoran's show
(lake scenes, Italian vistas) the prodigious talent that Sargent
already had at 12 or 13. Under Carolus-Duran he soon mastered the
necessary tonal vocabulary and tricks of the wrist. His palette
changed in later years, brightening. But the essential qualities of
his art _ a fluent shorthand and dashing control of light and
shadow _ were in place by the age of 22.
</P>
<P>
   Warhol and a few others notwithstanding, portraiture in America
has fallen on such hard times since World War II (has the
reputation of any other genre suffered as much?) that it may be
difficult to grasp its former position. At the turn of the century,
it thrived as a social barometer.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Sargent there were other portrait painters, now mostly
on the edge of history's radar screen, like Boldini and Sorolla,
who practiced a kind of freehand brush work similar to his. They
projected, as did he, a sense of ironic knowingness onto their
sitters.
</P>
<P>
   This was their advantage over photography. Photographers could
achieve a likeness, but these painters could turn likeness into
(italics)alikeness:(end italics) they made their breezy effects
imply social affect. Style signified class, and above all it
illustrated taste, a taste that was modern but not too modern,
elegant but not merely flashy, at ease with money but not modest
about it: essentially upper class.
</P>
<P>
   Sargent's virtue was to do all this better than anyone else, to
encapsulate most precisely the era's operative notion of luxe,
which was unapologetic, unreflective, sublimely superficial. He was
the gold standard during the Gilded Age. But he invented nothing;
he changed nothing.
</P>
<P>
   It's curious to read in the catalog for the National Gallery's
show that a few of his contemporaries discerned a degree of
subterranean criticism in his portraits. ``It is positively
dangerous to sit to Sargent,'' one aspiring sitter evidently
worried, absurdly. Who can know what these people meant, unless we
mistake our own moralizing judgments for Sargent's?
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary, attenuated portrait of the young Lord
Dalhousie, for example, in his white suit and scarlet tie, leaning
oh so casually against a giant pillar, looks comic now: a fop with
an uneven tan line. But who was he to Sargent? Certainly not a
joke.
</P>
<P>
   The picture pays homage to portraits of arrogant young men by
the great Mannerists Bronzino and Pontormo, and it is elevated
beyond caricature by the sheer brilliance of Sargent's handling,
his smooth application of translucent layers of white on white.
</P>
<P>
   No one did this better than he. The subtext of the picture, if
any, therefore seems to be entirely formal. It says that style,
raised to a sufficient peak, can become substance: the message in
many of Sargent's pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his portraits delve deeper. The one of his friend Henry
James expresses something of the heft and articulation of James'
prose. But mostly Sargent was satisfied to dazzle.
</P>
<P>
   His views of Venice from the 1880s explore in various ways the
bravura device of darkened figures in murky spaces against a
lighted backdrop. Sometimes a ray of sun cleaves the space
stunningly. Young Venetian women, like Greek koure, glide through
silent squares. They are part of the scenery, and ultimately as
remote and exotic as the city itself, which, after all, exists for
outsiders while remaining fundamentally closed to them.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   You might say, looking at his Venice pictures, that Sargent's
legacy is in large part to the history of modern travel. He
presents us with paradigms of tourism that for almost a century
have been the stuff of middle-class dreams and highbrow travel
brochures. A quality of nostalgia attaches to them.
</P>
<P>
   He shows us how light ricochets off the Grand Canal and sparkles
against white stone, turning it pink and periwinkle. In a series of
Venetian watercolors (he was the second best American
watercolorist, after Homer), we see a tourist's perspective, views
from his gondola as it carried him past the usual sites: the Scuola
di San Rocco, San Marco, Santa Maria della Salute.
</P>
<P>
   Venice suited him because it was a kind of living theater, with
everything on the surface. In some of his scenes, he actually seems
to present the tight piazzas and narrow alleys as stage sets,
skyless, the figures boxed in and thrust forward, as if leaning
toward the footlights.
</P>
<P>
   His sense of the stage matched the era's general embrace of
spectacle, and it affected his portraits no less than his other
pictures. His sitters often seem to perform in the sense that they
look improbably suave, affecting their ease.
</P>
<P>
   They act at not acting. You can say that their linen suits and
satin gowns and unruffled expressions are, in upper-class
turn-of-the-century terms, roughly equivalent to Bill Gates'
button-down shirts and geeky demeanor: they're there for show.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point is Almina, the fifth daughter of Asher
Wertheimer, a Bond Street art dealer whose family Sargent painted
so often that he once joked about being in a state of ``chronic
Wertheimerism.'' Wearing a Persian dress, turban and pearls, Almina
strums an Indian sarod. It's a ridiculous idea. She's a
peaches-and-cream Odalisque, a throwback to 18th English
portraiture. But she's saved by the fact that she seems to be in on
the gag: Sargent makes us think that she's consciously playing a
part, and so we like her for being game.
</P>
<P>
   It has often been pointed out that this master of pictorial
artifice and special effects was, in his personal life, rather
dull. A creature of laborious routine, an awkward
conversationalist, he seems to have been basically incurious.
Contrary to the cliche, art is rarely a true mirror of an artist's
life, and Sargent is further proof.
</P>
<P>
   If he ever had sex with a man or woman, we don't know. He had no
obvious political or religious convictions. We know he played the
piano and read avidly, but as Richard Ormond, his great-nephew and
one of the curators of the show at the National Gallery, writes, he
``remained strangely unworldly, unbusinesslike with money (he often
had to ask his patrons if they had paid him), disarmingly naive
about events taking place around him and terrified of publicity and
notoriety.''
</P>
<P>
   Put differently, we might say he was not particularly
self-aware, which may partly explain his curious desire, later in
life, to turn himself into the sort of painter he clearly was not.
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of us, artists don't always know what they're best
at, and they often want to be known for what they don't do well.
Around 1907 Sargent largely gave up portraiture to paint earnest,
unmemorable war pictures and bizarre biblical murals for the Boston
Public Library, imagining himself as heir to the great public
muralists and history painters of the past.
</P>
<P>
   There are several drawings for the murals at the Corcoran,
academic figure studies, flawless and bland. His big World War I
picture ``Gassed,'' which is at the National Gallery, illustrates
the problem best: a bloodless image of a gruesome event in which
the most memorable effect is a pink, luminous sky.
</P>
<P>
   If Sargent wanted to be remembered for pictures like ``Gassed,''
it didn't matter. When he died in 1925 at 69, he was still best
known for one thing, portraiture. The war by then had changed
Europe and made his embrace of the idle rich and their world of
leisure and sunshine seem anachronistic; not that the idle rich had
disappeared, merely that admiring them so publicly was no longer in
good taste.
</P>
<P>
   Sargent's conservative painting style might have been compatible
with the postwar return to order in art. (Picasso's classicism is
an example.) But style did not disguise substance in this case, and
it was widely felt that the substance of Sargent's art relegated
him to another era.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy years later, his bloodlessness and neutrality remain a
little enervating. You can leave the big exhibition stirred but not
shaken.
</P>
<P>
   But then he redeems himself, momentarily, with a picture like
``Two Girls in White Dresses.'' Kenneth Clark once said that with
Velazquez you could focus either on the image he painted or on the
way he painted it, on its surface; but that it was impossible to
hold these two things in mind simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is similar with this painting, in which the girls
recline on a sunny hill in the Alps, their forms emerging only
slowly out of a sumptuous swirl of pigment. The view is
vertiginous. We pick the figures out, below and ahead of us,
wrapped in their pink shawls, their dresses spreading out on the
ground at our feet. They are authentic modern Odalisques.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Sargent never experienced sex, but he certainly knew how
to paint it.

   WASHINGTON _ White workers are far more likely to have health
insurance paid by their employers than blacks or Hispanics,
according to a study released Thursday.

   The report by the nonprofit Commonwealth Fund found that 69
percent of white workers were covered by employer-sponsored
insurance, compared with 52 percent of black workers and 44 percent
of Hispanic workers. The study found even wider disparities among
different occupations.

   ``A variety of additional barriers may account for the
difference in health care coverage rates between whites and
minorities,'' said Allyson Hall, lead author of the study.
``Certain groups may decline health care coverage not only because
of financial concerns, but also because of differing perceptions
regarding the propensity to become ill and the overall need for
health care coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, 18 percent of workers between 18 and 64 were
uninsured in 1997, an increase from 15.7 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, minorities have been more likely than whites to be
uninsured. They often work in industries or in part-time jobs that
do not offer coverage, said Karen Davis, president of the
Commonwealth Fund.
</P>
<P>
   But even among fulltime workers, 37 percent of Hispanics were
uninsured, compared to 20 percent of blacks and 12 percent of
whites.
</P>
<P>
   Union workers, in general, had higher levels of
employer-sponsored coverage than non-union workers _ 89 percent to
64 percent _ but minorities were covered less even if they belonged
to a union. The study found 91 percent of white union members were
covered, compared to 86 percent for blacks and 84 percent for
Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Among non-union workers, the differences were more pronounced:
75 percent of white workers were covered, compared to 64 percent of
blacks and 52 percent for Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 percent of workers in manufacturing jobs had
employer-provided health coverage. Whites were covered 85 percent
of the time, compared to 71 percent for blacks and 60 percent for
Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Large firms were more likely to provide coverage than small
firms. In firms of more than 1,000 employees, 85 percent of whites
were covered, compared to 76 percent blacks and 72 percent
Hispanics. In companies of less than 100 workers, 63 percent of
whites were covered, compared to 47 percent for blacks and 38
percent for Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Lower wage earners also were less likely to be insured by an
employer. Among workers earning less than $7 an hour, 56 percent of
whites were covered, compared to 47 percent of blacks and 35
percent of Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Workers who are poor, not well-educated, not U.S. citizens,
unmarried, younger or live in an inner city or rural area are less
likely than their counterparts to have employers-based health
insurance,'' the report concluded. ``Most of these characteristics
have a greater effect on minority than white populations.''

Finally, the world will get the novel Ralph Ellison intended as his
follow-up (though not a sequel) to ``Invisible Man.'' Between now
and June, we'll also see new titles from several significant
authors. But these worthy books will probably be overshadowed by
the attention spewed out for just one title: ``Monica's Story'' by

nervous breakdown. Sharp and focused as a career woman, Grace is a
basket case as a new mother. For much of the film, Perez turns down
her trademark volume a notch or two, playing Grace with an atypical
confused sweetness. It's one of Perez's most likable performances
if only because it's one of her least grating. By ROBERT PHILPOT.

BRANDENBURG: BALLET INFUSED WITH A BIT OF THE BROADWAY MUSICAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Watching ``Brandenburg,'' Jerome Robbins' last
ballet, is both a sweet and sad experience. Robbins seems to have
poured a career's worth of choreographic and musical concerns and
signature moves into the work, which was performed by the New York
City Ballet on Wednesday night at the New York State Theater. All
those elements blend in a smooth-flowing plotless piece that is
good-looking, playful and tender.
</P>
<P>
   The imprint of Robbins' long years choreographing and directing
Broadway musicals is on the second of the ballet's two central pas
de deux. A man and a woman dance together but seldom touch, the
space between their bodies alive with unarticulated emotions that
are a good deal plainer and less metaphorically expressed than they
might be through the more formal manners of purer classical ballet.
</P>
<P>
   The patterns in ``Brandenburg'' are quietly masterly, as are the
ways Robbins mixes small and large ensembles and moves his dancers
on and off stage. Best of all, the choreographer's signature small
movement jokes, so mirthless-looking in retrospect, appear
delicately playful and utterly at home here. Unabrupt, they fit
seamlessly into the flow of the dance and are filled with genuine
humor and a new-seeming warmth.
</P>
<P>
   The dancers responded in kind, in a first-rate performance that
suggested but did not overstress all Robbins' small inventions. New
in the first pas de deux, Sebastien Marcovici seemed to be pushing
himself very hard, and his partnering of Wendy Whelan, in
particular, looked strained.
</P>
<P>
   James Fayette and Maria Kowroski, new in the second pas de deux,
turned that dance into an exercise in airy, delicately precise
dancing that worked in its own right but lacked the profound
sadness and drama embedded in the original interpretations by
Lourdes Lopez and Nikolaj Hubbe.
</P>
<P>
   Riolama Lorenzo and Stuart Capps were an interesting match in
the first of two subsidiary pas de deux, Capps adding a zesty
complementary edge to Ms. Lorenzo's innately glowing warmth. Rachel
Rutherford's lightness and speed gave her the look of a cheerfully
errant butterfly in the second duet, grounded charmingly by her
partner, Jared Angle. The lead cast was completed by Deanna
McBrearty, Carrie Lee Riggins, Benjamin Millepied and Christopher
Wheeldon.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins' ``Afternoon of a Faun,'' set to the Debussy score, is
capable of a surprising variety of subtle interpretations. Jock
Soto and Darci Kistler stressed the youthful glossiness of the two
dancers who meet and part in a ballet studio.
</P>
<P>
   Soto brought an unusual sexual intensity to his part, making the
duet more a boy-meets-girl story than a dance about the narcissism
of youth and, in particular, young ballet dancers. But Ms.
Kistler's frequent manipulation of her lustrous mane made this a
trio for a boy, a girl and her hair.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins' ``Antique Epigraphs,'' a gently stylized dance for
eight women dressed in soft-colored long Greek tunics, combines
perfectly with its Debussy score to suggest a community of women
that is of the distant past yet afloat in time and space, intent on
mysterious private rituals.
</P>
<P>
   The four soloists _ Helene Alexopoulos, Ms. Kowroski, Ms.
Lorenzo and Monique Meunier _ caught the distinct nuances of their
dances without separating from the group, completed by Jenny
Blascovich, Ms. McBrearty, Dana Hanson and Melissa Walter. Paul
Dunkel was the solo flutist. Hugo Fiorato conducted.

SHORT MOVIE REVIEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: The word (star) should be replaced with the symbol)  
 (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or
noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York
City. (star) denotes a highly recommended film or series. Ratings
and running times are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   Now Playing
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``AFFLICTION,'' starring Nick Nolte, James Coburn, Willem
Dafoe, Sissy Spacek and Mary Beth Hurt. Directed by Paul Schrader
(R, 114 minutes). Nolte is devastating in the performance of his
career, as Wade Whitehouse, a New Hampshire loner fighting a losing
battle with demons from his past.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost among them: Coburn, terrifyingly authentic as the
drunken, abusive father who long ago cowed his sons into
submission. As directed by Schrader, this pure, unfettered
adaptation of Russell Banks' novel starts on a deceptively ordinary
note, then escalates into inexorable fury. Every little detail
matters. Ms. Spacek and Ms. Hurt expertly play the women who
trigger Wade's crisis (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``ANOTHER DAY IN PARADISE,'' starring James Woods and
Melanie Griffith. Directed by Larry Clark (R, 101 minutes). From
the director of the bruising and ominous ``Kids,'' this vibrant,
unapologetically seedy road movie is a virtual day at the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's second feature may not have the sting of his first, but
it comes closer to establishing him as William S. Burroughs with a
swooping, pivoting movie camera, bringing bizarrely innocent
enthusiasm to material that might otherwise ooze druggy shock
value, and making decadence as basic as the weather. Woods, as a
junkie, thief and absurdly unlikely father figure, revels in this
full-throttle role (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``BLAST FROM THE PAST,'' starring Brendan Fraser, Christopher
Walken, Alicia Silverstone and Sissy Spacek. Directed by Hugh
Wilson (PG-13, 105 minutes). More amusingly than might be expected,
this comedy tells the story of one very nuclear family that has
been hiding in a fallout shelter since 1962, and emerges into a 90s
world of grunge and attitude.
</P>
<P>
   In fact it's funnier underground, with Fraser as the strapping
son of a cheerfully mad scientist (Walken) and sherry-sipping
housewife (Ms. Spacek), 1962-style. Once he comes above ground and
meets a hard-boiled Ms. Silverstone, it's clear that Fraser is once
again a film's true ingenue, doing the wide-eyed hunk thing that
has become his specialty. He does it a lot better in ``Gods and
Monsters,'' but this comedy is still lighthearted fun (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``CENTRAL STATION,'' starring Fernanda Montenegro,
Vinicius de Oliveira and Marilia Pera. Directed by Walter Salles
(R, 115 minutes). In this quiet, luminous Brazilian gem, a joyless
older woman crosses paths with an orphaned young boy. There's
plenty of room for sentimentality here, but the wonder of Salles'
film is all in the telling.
</P>
<P>
   As these characters develop a fractious bond, then embark on a
road trip that takes them vividly to Brazil's hinterlands in search
of the boy's father, Salles brings great tenderness and surprise to
the events that punctuate their journey. Ms. Montenegro's tough
bravura performance was one of last year's very best (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``A CIVIL ACTION,'' starring John Travolta and Robert
Duvall. Directed by Steven Zaillian (PG-13, 120 minutes). This
story of a David-Goliath lawsuit against industrial polluters, with
Travolta first-rate as an ambulance chaser who develops a
conscience, could have been business as usual in the legal thriller
genre.
</P>
<P>
   But Zaillian's keenly observed, beautifully acted film, based on
Jonathan Harr's nonfiction best seller about a case in Woburn,
Mass., doesn't follow familiar formulas. It follows all the
surprises and frustrations of a story that was never black and
white and is all the better for its shades of gray. Duvall is
outstanding as a corporate lawyer full of wily tricks (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``MY FAVORITE MARTIAN,'' starring Christopher Lloyd, Jeff
Daniels and Ray Walston. Directed by Donald Petrie (PG, 88
minutes). Pixilated pixels and other up-to-the-minute moviemaking
magic manage the neat feat of turning the big-screen, resurrected
``My Favorite Martian'' into an amiable family entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   In this updated version of the 1960s CBS sitcom, Jeff Daniels as
Tim O'Hara (now a television newsman rather than a newspaper
reporter) and Christopher Lloyd as the visitor from another planet,
take over the roles played by Bill Bixby and Ray Walston. In one of
the happy and logical little jokes that lend a disarming charm to
the comedy, Walston turns up once again in a welcome guise as
government bloodhounds set out to capture the Martian. But a good
deal of the fun in this tale is provided by Zoot, his high-spirited
polymorphic space suit (Lawrence Van Gelder).
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``HILARY AND JACKIE,'' starring Emily Watson and Rachel
Griffiths. Directed by Anand Tucker (R, 121 minutes). The parallel
biographies of the brilliant cellist Jacqueline du Pre (Ms.
Watson), who contracted multiple sclerosis at the height of her
career, and her slightly older sister, Hilary (Ms. Griffiths), a
talented flutist who gave up a professional career to marry and be
``ordinary,'' is one of the most insightful studies of sibling
rivalry ever filmed.
</P>
<P>
   Jacqueline may have won fame and glory, the movie says, but she
remained a desperately needy emotional child who had to have
everything Hilary had (including Hilary's husband). The film is
structured like a concerto, in three movements, the last of which
ends with Jackie's harrowing death in her sister's arms. The drama
is deepened by a soundtrack that makes expert use of Jacqueline's
signature piece, the Elgar Cello Concerto in E minor. Ms. Watson's
Jacqueline flames with an almost scary intensity (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL,'' directed by and starring Roberto
Benigni (PG-13, 122 minutes). Italy's most antic funnyman dares to
find humor and tenderness in the midst of the Holocaust, and his
risk pays off. This Cannes prize winner is as stubbornly
entertaining as its central character, a Jewish waiter named Guido
who jokes his way through the nightmare for the sake of his loved
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Daring also to combine an opening hour of romance and pranks
with a more somber second act, Benigni avoids all traces of the
maudlin and effectively creates a situation in which comedy is
courage. In this unpretentious, enormously likable film, he shines
as a father whose fibs and hilarious buffoonery know no bounds, and
no fear (Maslin).

15 MINUTES WITH MIKE JUDGE (AND SUBLIMINAL BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD
CHRISTIANITY)
</HEADLINE>
 (Accompanies FILM-OFFICE SPACE) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Judge has come full circle: office worker, bass musician
for Texas blues artists, animator of ``Beavis and Butt-head'' and
``King of the Hill,'' and now, writer-director of the live-action
``Office Space,'' a subversive slacker comedy that was inspired by
his days as an office worker.
</P>
<P>
   A decade or so ago, Judge's life was filled with droning bosses
and recalcitrant office equipment. Now it's filled with media
stardom, occasional controversy and interviews, such as the quick
15 minutes he was able to steal for a phone chat. To be fair, the
former Richardson, Texas, resident _ a surprisingly mild-mannered,
low-key 36-year-old _ would have talked longer if he could. But he
couldn't. So we took what we could get. The highlights:
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that you were one of the 20 highest-paid people in the
entertainment industry. But it seems like you've stayed connected
with all the things that frustrated you when you were an office
worker.
</P>
<P>
   A: I guess I still feel the pain. I didn't come into all this
until I was pushing 30, so I still have a mountain of material. And
I don't lead all that weird of a life. I live in a pretty normal
area (in Austin), and that amount of money they reported I guess
was based on what I might make off of ``King of the Hill's''
syndication in my lifetime. But I didn't see any of that last year.
</P>
<P>
   I think if I'd become successful when I was 18 or something, I
might be a freak who's completely out of touch.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Have you gotten to the point where if you hear another Beavis
or Butt-head impersonation, you're just gonna go ballistic?
</P>
<P>
   A: (Laughs). One would think that, but it doesn't happen that
often. Although when it does, it doesn't take long to get old. I
don't get recognized all that often, and when I do, I end up not
hearing Beavis and Butt-head imitations nearly as much as other
people do. A lot of people are afraid to do it around me.
</P>
<P>
   There was a guy at an airport once, though _ for some reason,
some autograph people found me at an airport, and this guy would
not stop. He went on for literally 20 minutes, and that drove me
crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Someone told me that some group called Beavis and Butt-head
``the evangelicals of the '90s.''
</P>
<P>
   A: I think it was a paper in Dallas that called them the
``theologians of the year.'' Back in '92, when I started working on
the show, there was still occasional stuff in the news about
backward satanic messages in heavy-metal songs. So I thought it'd
be funny to put subliminal Christian messages in ``Beavis and
Butt-head.'' And I did it quite a few times. I'm surprised that
nobody mentioned it, ever. And I did it quite a bit, with Beavis,
especially. Even put some backward stuff in, but really, just like
him saying, in the middle of a video (goes into Beavis voice)
``aaarrrggghhh, Christ is cool!'' And nobody ever said anything
about it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I noticed two connections that run through ``Beavis and
Butt-head, King of the Hill'' and ``Office Space:'' Baseball bats
come up at least once, and so does fire. Are you aware of these
obsessions, or is it just subconscious?
</P>
<P>
   A: (Laughs) Oh, wow, no, I didn't even think about that. I was
worried at one point, I did think about the fire, I thought, ``Oh,
God, do I have too much fire in my stuff?'' But I think you could
fairly say that 75 percent of the animated Disney movies have a big
fire at the end. So I don't think I have, really, a fire problem. I
think it got more attention because of the ``Beavis and Butt-head''
controversy. ``King of the Hill's'' gone on pretty well with no _
well, propane I guess ...
</P>
<P>
   Q: And the Mega Lo-Mart explosion (which was last season's
cliffhanger).
</P>
<P>
   A: Yeah, well, that wasn't my idea. Although I liked it, and
fully embraced it.

 UNDATED: fear (Maslin).  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE,'' starring Kevin Costner, Robin Wright
Penn and Paul Newman. Directed by Luis Mandoki (PG-13, 110
minutes). Nicholas Sparks' best-selling novel, about a lonely,
sensitive man who sends a message out to sea and the lonely,
beautiful woman who finds it, is now a long and soggy film. Kevin
Costner crosses the line from teasingly laconic to stodgy, and
seems as likely to have written ``Bleak House'' as the love letter
in question. Robin Wright Penn makes an appealing heroine, but
there's not much room for real emotion in a film with the tenor of
a commercial for hazelnut-flavored coffee. As the hero's crusty old
father, Newman steals what's left of the show (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``PAYBACK,'' starring Mel Gibson and Gregg Henry. Directed by
Brian Helgeland (R, 110 minutes). In this inept, excessively
sadistic film-noir spoof adapted from the same Richard Stark novel
(``The Hunter'') that inspired the 1967 genre classic ``Point
Blank,'' Gibson is a thief named Porter who retaliates with a
vengeance after an attempt on his life.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to recover $70,000 that was stolen from him by a
double-crossing partner in crime, he works his way up the pecking
order of a crime syndicate brutally dispatching all who stand in
his way. The hard-boiled dialogue is ludicrous, the storytelling
clunky, the acting fair to awful, the gore ankle-deep. Credit the
star with being able to keep a straight face through this loathsome
mess (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``THE PRINCE OF EGYPT,'' starring the voices of Val
Kilmer, Ralph Fiennes and Michelle Pfeiffer. Directed by Brenda
Chapman, Steve Hickner and Simon Wells (PG, 93 minutes). First came
the great expectations for this animated magnum opus from
Dreamworks. Then came reality, in a film struggling mightily to
balance animated whimsy and biblical stature. The upshot is an
admirably worthy rendering of the Exodus story, even if Moses must
initially be seen as a playful young scamp. Biblical plagues and
miracles serve as special inspiration for the animators'
reality-bending ingenuity (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``RUSHMORE,'' starring Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray and
Olivia Williams. Directed by Wes Anderson (R, 93 minutes). A dryly
hilarious portrait of the mogul as a young man, with Schwartzman a
real find as its perfectly horrid little hero, Max Fischer. Max's
prep school, Rushmore Academy, does have a faculty, but none of the
grown-ups have anything like Max's natural authority. Murray is
sneakily fine as the steel tycoon and Rushmore benefactor who
happens to be on Max's own wavelength as they vie for the same
beautiful teacher. A particular treat for its skewed, outrageously
funny memories of a cutthroat boyhood (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE,'' starring Joseph Fiennes and
Gwyneth Paltrow. Directed by John Madden (R, 113 minutes). A witty,
sexy and merrily literate delight, with an exhilaratingly clever
premise that only gets better as the film unfolds. The screenplay,
originating as Marc Norman's brainstorm and turned by Tom Stoppard
into razor-sharp dialogue reminiscent of his ``Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern Are Dead,'' dares to imagine whatever it likes about
the link between Shakespeare's artistic passions and his mad
yearning for a certain aristocratic beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, this tirelessly inventive comedy envisions an
Elizabethan theater fraught with the same backbiting and conniving
we enjoy today, and has great fun presenting the creation of
``Romeo and Juliet,'' glitches and all. Fiennes and Ms. Paltrow
make a fine, tempestuous duo, and she gives the first great, fully
realized starring performance of her career (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``A SIMPLE PLAN,'' starring Bill Paxton, Billy Bob
Thornton and Bridget Fonda. Directed by Sam Raimi (R, 120 minutes).
This onetime cult horror director makes a flawless transition to
mainstream storytelling with a quietly devastating thriller. And
its fine cast plays out the consequences of a harmless-sounding
error in judgment that winds up leveling everything in its path.
</P>
<P>
   The catalyst is $4.4 million that literally falls out of the
sky, and Scott B. Smith's story proves how deadly the morality of
expediency can become. When you get the shivers watching this
wintry tale, which features an especially memorable performance
from Thornton, it won't be from the cold (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``TANGO,'' starring Miguel Angel Sola. Written and
directed by Carlos Saura. Cinematography by Vittorio Storaro
(PG-13, 100 minutes). A thrilling display of tango heat and
virtuosity. And it's no slight to the actors who play lovers to say
that the dancing here is steamier than any kiss. In his most
electrifying dance film, Saura offers transfixingly beautiful
glimpses of the dance and the great range of emotions it can
conjure. Storaro's dazzlingly fluid cinematography captures all the
nuances this material demands. Everyone in the film is utterly
consumed by tango fever; audiences will be, too (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE THIN RED LINE,'' starring Jim Caviezel, Ben Chaplin, Nick
Nolte and Sean Penn. Directed by Terrence Malick (R, 166 minutes).
From the first frame of this huge, drifting war epic loosely
derived from James Jones' Guadalcanal novel, it's viscerally clear
that Malick is back. The exquisite, oddly detached visual style
that made ``Badlands'' and ``Days of Heaven'' the most beautiful
films of the 1970s is instantly apparent here, even if the
narrative vagueness and brooding voice-overs are also familiar.
</P>
<P>
   The film sprawls, gets lost and occasionally delivers visual
poetry, the kind that could have been greatly helped by tighter
editing. Bottom line: no one who admired Malick's early work should
miss this. But those expecting anything simple will not find it
here (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   Film Series
</P>
<P>
   ``SECOND ACT: SECOND SEASON.'' Post-World War II Italian cinema
receives another outing at the Museum of Modern Art in a second
installment of a series intended to revive interest in the history
of Italian films and to offer the opportunity to discover or
rediscover significant works by renowned and lesser-known
directors.
</P>
<P>
   Later this month the series will offer ``Variety Lights''
(1950), Federico Fellini's debut as a director. But this weekend's
attractions include Lina Wertmuller's first film, ``The Lizards''
(1963), a story of provincial life in southern Italy, at 6 p.m.
Saturday and on Sunday at 2 p.m.; and, at 2 p.m. Saturday, ``The
Organizer'' (1963), directed by Mario Monicelli and starring
Marcello Mastroianni as a bearded socialist fomenting strikes in
Turin. Continuing through March 2 at the museum, 11 West 53rd
Street, Manhattan, the series is free with museum admission: $9.50
for adults, $6.50 for students and people 65 or older; free for
visitors under 16 accompanied by an adult. Pay what you wish on
Fridays from 4:30 to 8:30 p.m. Screening information: (212)

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite a threatening appearance to the weather map, the storm
over the Southeast should only skirt the Northeast Friday night and
Saturday. A potent disturbance in the southern Appalachians will
produce moderate to heavy snow in the Smoky Mountains, mainly above
2,000 feet. Sleet will mix with rain in the foothills of the
western Carolinas. A brisk wind will enhance the chill at the coast
with gusts over gale force expected on the Outer Banks. Rain will
spread from North Carolina through Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   A vigorous jet stream over the Deep South, with wind speeds
exceeding 100 miles an hour at 25,000 feet, will propel the
Carolina storm offshore before it can turn northward. This should
spare much of the Northeast from the brunt of its wintry weather.
However, southeast New England may receive significant snowfall on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure building over the Great Lakes will circulate
chilly, dry air into the Northeast, Ohio Valley and Middle West.
Though clouds will persist in many locations, a few hours of
sunshine are likely in most places. Snow flurries will develop in
Michigan and Wisconsin as extremely cold air passes over the open
waters of Lake Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Patches of light snow will develop in the Dakotas ahead of a
complex cold front. Snow showers will linger along the west slopes
of the central and northern Rockies. High pressure moving into
Oregon will bring an end to the strong onshore flow. However,
clouds and showers will persist in western Washington, but some
sunshine will return farther south.
</P>
<P>
   The Southwest will be bright and warmer with an active breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Pounding Waves &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A series of Pacific tempests have raised angry seas that have
pounded the Oregon coast with waves up to 40 feet high this week.
Waves do not release their energy until they break into whitecaps.
A swimmer who encounters a wave before it breaks just bobs up and
down. But, the same swimmer can be tossed violently by a breaking
wave. The pressure exerted by breaking waves has been measured at
more than 16,000 pounds per square inch. Breaking waves once tossed
a rock weighing 135 pounds through the roof of Tillamook Rock
Lighthouse in Oregon, a structure that rises 151 feet above the
sea.

TRANSAMERICA PYRAMID BUILT ON CONTROVERSY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LARRY D. HATFIELD  
 and GERALD D. ADAMS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Though it is now one of the most recognized
buildings in the world, the Transamerica Pyramid at its inception
30 years ago was one of the most controversial and most vilified.
</P>
<P>
   Hailed by its fans as the world's first modern pyramid when it
poked into the sky in 1972, the building was branded by critics,
including one who called it antisocial architecture at its worst.
</P>
<P>
   The 853-foot, $35 million building pitted nearly every
architectural critic in America, the late San Francisco Planning
Director Allan Jacobs, angry demonstrators and a good many city
residents against Mayor Joseph Alioto, the Transamerica Corp., Los
Angeles architects William L. Pereira and Associates and the
editorial pages of the city's two main newspapers, the San
Francisco Examiner and the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Now the building and the company that built it enter a new era:
Aegon NV, a Dutch insurance conglomerate, announced Thursday that
it would acquire the San Francisco life insurance company for $9.7
billion in stock and cash.
</P>
<P>
   The Pyramid, constructed in an area that Gen. William T. Sherman
once described as ``the worst bog and succession of mudholes
masquerading as a street in the United States,'' was designed in
1969 to tower 1,040 feet.
</P>
<P>
   It would have dwarfed its nearby neighbor, the
also-controversial 52-story Bank of America tower.
</P>
<P>
   Even when it was shortened, it still was the highest man-made
structure west of Chicago and reached higher than the towers of the
Golden Gate Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle's Pulitzer Prize-winning architectural critic,
Allan Temko, called it an abomination, and still believes that. The
Los Angeles Times called the spire gratuitous and compared it to a
dunce cap.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs called the building inhuman but Alioto, whose shiny pate
was as distinctive the Pyramid, had the muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs tried to kill the proposal to build the pointy giant, but
Alioto, who could lack subtlety, threatened to fire planning
commissioners if they agreed. A 4-3 majority fell into line,
approved the building and gave Transamerica a section of historic
Merchant Street.
</P>
<P>
   The block on which the Pyramid sits, bounded by Montgomery,
Washington, Clay and Sansome streets, long been the heart of San
Francisco's Financial District.
</P>
<P>
   The part of Merchant Street that was obliterated by the Pyramid
once was called Fish Alley, an extension of the open air market
that had dominated that part of town.
</P>
<P>
   At the time it established its controversial world headquarters
there, moving from another building in the neighborhood,
Transamerica was one of the nation's biggest holding companies.
</P>
<P>
   Architect Pereira was faced with a much smaller site than the
nearby Bank of America building but he was helped by the fact there
was no height limit where the tower would be built.
</P>
<P>
   When the plans were unveiled in January 1969, Pereira promised a
building of ``simple classical form'' providing a graceful
silhouette with minimum obstruction of the skyline. Transamerica
Chairman John Beckett said he wanted to give the city a valentine.
</P>
<P>
   The critics who warned of a forest of skyscrapers being inspired
by the Pyramid were right. What once was one of the city's most
colorful neighborhoods is now filled with high-rise buildings, most
of them with less architectural distinction than the Pyramid.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the long-vanished produce and fish market, gone, too,
are such venerable landmarks as the Blue Fox, Black Cat, Purple
Onion, Iron Pot, Pietro's, the Hall of Justice, Bea and Ray Goman's
Gay '90s, Earthquake McGoon's, where Turk Murphy and his band
played, and the Barbary Coast international settlement.

   To some, they're frightening. To others, they seem almost
magical. Their webbed wings help them soar through the night sky.
Their echolocation skills are a wonder. They are bats, one of the
most successful creatures on the planet: One out of every four
mammal species is a bat. Bats have left few fossils behind, so
their evolution remains an enigma among researchers. One of the
major points of contention is which came first, echolocation or
flight. Carl Zimmer, senior editor at Discover magazine, discusses
the debate in the scientific community over these unusual
creatures.

   Nancy Simmons went down to the jungles of French Guiana in 1991
with the seemingly simple mission of determining how many species
of bats live in one place. She surveyed her site for three field
seasons. She was overwhelmed by the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ended up getting 78 species of bats from an area that was
within a three-kilometer walk of our camp, just a pinprick on the
map.''
</P>
<P>
   The great variety of bats seen today is just part of the larger
evolutionary mystery surrounding these creatures. Simmons, who
works at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, is a
paleontologist by training. Before she entered the jungle to look
for live bats, she had spent years studying a miserably scrappy
record of bat fossils.
</P>
<P>
   Bats are not good candidates for paleontological study. When
they die, they usually disappear. Often they are eaten by
scavengers; if not, they decompose on the ground. The muscles and
membranous skin that make up their wings rot away. As a result
there are only a handful of complete bat fossils in the entire
world.
</P>
<P>
   Paleontologists like Simmons have studied those few relics
assiduously because, living or dead, bats pose one of evolution's
supreme puzzles. A few other mammals may be able to glide from tree
to tree, but only bats have evolved true powered flight. In fact,
only two other vertebrates _ birds and pterosaurs _ ever managed
this feat. But with little fossil evidence to go by, it's hard to
figure out how bats did it.
</P>
<P>
   What did the first bat look like, and how did it survive? And
how did bats diverge into the forms they take today? Piecing
together the story of bat evolution requires researchers to
determine in what order bats' marvelous flying and echolocating
(locating objects by means of reflecting sound waves) equipment
developed.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s one intriguing scenario was constructed by Brock
Fenton, a zoologist at York University in Ontario. Fenton suggested
that bats became echolocaters first and only later acquired the
ability to fly.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that a bat ancestor running through trees at night
on four legs, catching insects to survive, might have found it
could hear the faint echo of its calls as they bounced off a bug
flying past. Its descendants might have started to reach for
passing insects, and evolution would then have favored protobats
with longer and longer arms, and with webbing between their fingers
to help them catch their prey.
</P>
<P>
   Their calls would have become more focused and powerful, and
they might have been able to start gliding from tree to tree.
Eventually their descendants could fly under their own steam and
catch insects in midflight.
</P>
<P>
   That model came under fire, however, when John Speakman, a
zoologist at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, measured the
metabolic cost of an echolocating pulse and found that it cranked
up the animal's metabolism by a factor of nine. And that was for a
stationary bat _ how could a bat handle both that cost and the huge
metabolic cost of flight simultaneously?
</P>
<P>
   But when Speakman then measured the energy expenditures of bats
while they are flying, he got a surprising result. Bats, it turns
out, can use the energy required for flying to echolocate for free.
</P>
<P>
   The contracting muscles not only move the bat's wings but also
squeeze its rib cage, pushing the air out of its lungs and through
its voice box, creating the echolocating pulses.
</P>
<P>
   These results have led Speakman to question whether the earliest
bats could have evolved echolocation before flight, since it takes
so much effort while perching. Instead he has suggested that flight
and echolocation evolved hand in hand, improving by little steps
together.
</P>
<P>
   As with any transition in evolution, you can craft all sorts of
plausible scenarios for how bats came to be. The genealogy of bats
is a murky matter, though, and has inspired some pretty exotic
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, for example, John Pettigrew of the University of
Queensland in Australia suggested that megachiropterans, the giants
of the bat world, weren't bats at all but were actually closer to
primates.
</P>
<P>
   Largely in response to Pettigrew's work, there was an avalanche
of bat research in the late 1980s and the 1990s. Simmons was one of
those involved.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of paleontologist Jonathan Geisler, also of the
American Museum of Natural History, Simmons gathered together the
findings of other bat experts and examined many species of bats
herself.
</P>
<P>
   Based on her studies she adds her support to the idea that
megachiropterans are indeed bats and not primates with wings, as
Pettigrew claimed.
</P>
<P>
   The similarity of their wiring to that of the brains of
primates, she says, is just a sign that both groups got their start
using vision to live nocturnally. Thus all bats seen today, from
large, big-eyed fruit eaters to small, echolocating insect hunters,
descend from a common ancestor.
</P>
<P>
   Yet she also concludes that the megachiropterans did split away
from other bats long ago. Those fossil bats, she says, are actually
on the path toward microchiropterans, or ``little bats,'' the
suborder to which most bats belong.
</P>
<P>
   That means, Simmons points out, that the common ancestor of all
today's bats and the known fossils could already fly. And that
megachiropterans, while they have undergone a fair amount of
evolution since those early days, are in some ways relic
representatives of those first forms. Those ancient bats, she
reasons, couldn't echolocate. The few megachiropterans that can
echolocate today seem to have evolved the ability independently
from their smaller cousins.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to test the ideas of Simmons and Speakman and
others will be to get more evolutionary information. But
considering how hard it is to find bat fossils, it may be quite
some time.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Simmons will be returning to the jungles of
South America (this time Peru) to catch more living bats. There are
enough mysteries flying around in the night to keep her busy.

 By COREY S. POWELL  
 c.1999 Discover magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   A computer virus that could hide in an innocent-looking e-mail
message, slip past antivirus software and erase the files on your
hard drive would be a hacker's dream _ and a nightmare for the rest
of us. Fortunately, there is no such virus _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   But in July, computer engineer Marko Laakso and his colleagues
at the University of Oulu in Finland found a worrisome security
hole in three popular e-mail programs _ Microsoft Outlook Express,
Outlook 98 and Netscape Mail. A clever hacker, the Finnish
researchers warned, could exploit this flaw and transform an
ordinary bit of e-mail into a carrier for a data-destroying virus.
</P>
<P>
   The flaw arose not from some fancy new software feature but from
an old problem common to many e-mail programs. The programs'
designers assumed that the name of an e-mail attachment (something
linked to the message, such as another document or an image) would
be fairly short, so they set a 200-character limit for the length
of the name. If the name exceeds that limit, the extra data could
cause your computer to crash or possibly even instruct it to run a
rogue program hidden in the e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a common flaw, but one that's easy to fix,'' says
security specialist William Orvis of the Computer Incident Advisory
Capability at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in
California. The almost embarrassingly simple solution is to rewrite
the software so that the program shortens names longer than 200
characters.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and Netscape quickly publicized the problem and
offered free corrective software on their Web sites. A few days
later, Qualcomm announced that its popular Eudora e-mail software
contained a different flaw, which could allow a seemingly innocuous
Web link contained in an e-mail message to trigger a virus program.
The solution again was relatively simple. Despite the quick fixes,
however, the media and the Internet buzzed with news of a
frightening-sounding and pervasive vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   Those fears were largely groundless, says Orvis, who points out
that there has never been a documented case of a virus infecting a
computer as a result of someone reading e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard of anyone bitten by this attack,'' he says.
``Not that many people know how to exploit it. And if you did, the
FBI would be on your case very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the negative media coverage focused on everybody's
favorite villain, Microsoft. The software giant was charged with
skimping on security and offering an initial software fix that did
not cover all the potential weak spots in its Outlook e-mail
programs. But Laakso cautions that ``most of the major vendors make
the same kind of mistake.'' Moreover, other computer security
problems are far more serious than the threat posed by e-mail
viruses.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Hernan, who works at the Computer Emergency Response Team
at Carnegie Mellon, points to the much greater danger of intruders
who hack their way into Internet service providers _ the companies
that provide connections to the Internet. He notes that CERT has
received reports of interlopers invading computer systems operated
by hospitals, corporations and software vendors. Hernan blames
these broader security problems on sloppiness among the companies
that develop and sell the susceptible software _ and on the people
who buy their products.
</P>
<P>
   ``They produce what the public demands: feature-rich, faster,
easier-to-use products,'' he says. Security usually ranks very low
on the list of consumer concerns.
</P>
<P>
   People and companies that depend seriously on the sanctity of
their communications will need to be more cautious, says Orvis. He
gives this advice: Be careful and be prepared (in other words,
don't ever take candy _ or any free software _ from strangers, and
don't leave the only copy of your magnum opus on your hard drive).
Keeping on top of software updates and paying close attention to
security advisories will also help.
</P>
<P>
   That may seem like an awful lot of effort to the casual computer
user. But when it comes to computer security, the options are few.
People could choose to disconnect from the Internet _ an isolated
computer is, after all, a completely secure one. Or they could just
accept that sometimes things will go wrong.

   A computer virus that could hide in an innocent-looking e-mail
message, slip past antivirus software and erase the files on your
hard drive would be a hacker's dream _ and a nightmare for the rest
of us. Fortunately, there is no such virus _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   But in July, computer engineer Marko Laakso and his colleagues
at the University of Oulu in Finland found a worrisome security
hole in three popular e-mail programs _ Microsoft Outlook Express,
Outlook 98 and Netscape Mail. A clever hacker, the Finnish
researchers warned, could exploit this flaw and transform an
ordinary bit of e-mail into a carrier for a data-destroying virus.
</P>
<P>
   The flaw arose not from some fancy new software feature but from
an old problem common to many e-mail programs. The programs'
designers assumed that the name of an e-mail attachment (something
linked to the message, such as another document or an image) would
be fairly short, so they set a 200-character limit for the length
of the name. If the name exceeds that limit, the extra data could
cause your computer to crash or possibly even instruct it to run a
rogue program hidden in the e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a common flaw, but one that's easy to fix,'' says
security specialist William Orvis of the Computer Incident Advisory
Capability at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in
California. The almost embarrassingly simple solution is to rewrite
the software so that the program shortens names longer than 200
characters.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and Netscape quickly publicized the problem and
offered free corrective software on their Web sites. A few days
later, Qualcomm announced that its popular Eudora e-mail software
contained a different flaw, which could allow a seemingly innocuous
Web link contained in an e-mail message to trigger a virus program.
The solution again was relatively simple. Despite the quick fixes,
however, the media and the Internet buzzed with news of a
frightening-sounding and pervasive vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   Those fears were largely groundless, says Orvis, who points out
that there has never been a documented case of a virus infecting a
computer as a result of someone reading e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard of anyone bitten by this attack,'' he says.
``Not that many people know how to exploit it. And if you did, the
FBI would be on your case very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the negative media coverage focused on everybody's
favorite villain, Microsoft. The software giant was charged with
skimping on security and offering an initial software fix that did
not cover all the potential weak spots in its Outlook e-mail
programs. But Laakso cautions that ``most of the major vendors make
the same kind of mistake.'' Moreover, other computer security
problems are far more serious than the threat posed by e-mail
viruses.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Hernan, who works at the Computer Emergency Response Team
at Carnegie Mellon, points to the much greater danger of intruders
who hack their way into Internet service providers _ the companies
that provide connections to the Internet. He notes that CERT has
received reports of interlopers invading computer systems operated
by hospitals, corporations and software vendors. Hernan blames
these broader security problems on sloppiness among the companies
that develop and sell the susceptible software _ and on the people
who buy their products.
</P>
<P>
   ``They produce what the public demands: feature-rich, faster,
easier-to-use products,'' he says. Security usually ranks very low
on the list of consumer concerns.
</P>
<P>
   People and companies that depend seriously on the sanctity of
their communications will need to be more cautious, says Orvis. He
gives this advice: Be careful and be prepared (in other words,
don't ever take candy _ or any free software _ from strangers, and
don't leave the only copy of your magnum opus on your hard drive).
Keeping on top of software updates and paying close attention to
security advisories will also help.
</P>
<P>
   That may seem like an awful lot of effort to the casual computer
user. But when it comes to computer security, the options are few.
People could choose to disconnect from the Internet _ an isolated
computer is, after all, a completely secure one. Or they could just
accept that sometimes things will go wrong.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Joel Sachs might reasonably have taken some vacation
time at the end of January, and when his voice-mail message early
this month said he would be out of town for a few days, that was
the natural assumption. Sachs had just directed the annual weeklong
Focus Festival at the Juilliard School, devoted this year to
American music composed in the 1990s. Sachs, a pianist and
conductor on the faculty who has made crusading for new music his
life's work, selected the festival's 47 scores, by as many
composers; conducted the first of the seven concerts, oversaw
rehearsals for the others, wrote the extensive program notes and
moderated discussions.
</P>
<P>
   But down time seems not to figure into Sachs schedule. His
out-of-town trip was to participate in a residency at the College
of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Va., with Continuum, the
new-music ensemble he directs with Cheryl Seltzer, the pianist who
founded it in 1967. Immediately upon his return from Williamsburg,
Sachs repacked his bags and took Continuum to Paris to play works
by New York composers in Radio France's ``Presences'' festival.
</P>
<P>
   By April, Continuum will also have played at festivals in
Aarhus, Denmark, and Tashkent, Uzbekistan, and held workshops in
Puerto Rico and Michigan. In the meantime it is offering a concert
of Leon Kirchner's rigorously structured and appealingly lyrical
music Saturday evening at Merkin Concert Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, it's continuous,'' Sachs said, punning on the
ensemble's name. ``Our method with Continuum comes from never
stopping working.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also Sachs' personal method. At Juilliard, he conducts the
New Juilliard Ensemble, a new-music orchestra, in five concerts a
year, including one next Friday evening. And since 1993 he has been
assembling and directing the nine weeks of thematic Summergarden
programs at the Museum of Modern Art, which are also performed by
enterprising Juilliard students. He said he had no idea how many
works he prepares for performances in a year, to say nothing of how
many scores he sorts through before making his selections. But
caught for an interview after an evening rehearsal, he seemed
energized by his schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're living in a wonderful time, musically,'' he
said. ``There are all kinds of really fine composers around, and
anyone who wants to feel connected with the music of the time has
all kinds of possibilities. Nobody can like everything, but there
is something out there for everybody, from those who approach music
very intellectually to those who say, `I know what I like, and
that's what I want to hear.'''
</P>
<P>
   Luring an audience to the new-music fold has been central to
Continuum's mission almost from the start. Sachs and Ms. Seltzer
believe that new music can find friends among concertgoers if it is
presented properly and played with energy and enthusiasm. But they
recognize that many concertgoers remain hostile to new music, even
though the last two generations of composers have been writing
music that increasingly speaks to listeners who wish that
19th-century Romanticism had continued unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   And they realize that many listeners trace their distaste for
new works to compositional styles dominant during the first
three-quarters of the 20th century, styles that Continuum stands
behind, but that are only part of its portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   The devil figure for antimodernists is Arnold Schoenberg, whose
``Moses und Aron'' is being offered at the Metropolitan Opera; a
performance, with a national broadcast carried in New York on
WQXR-FM (96.3), will be presented Saturday at 1:30 p.m. The Met's
production shows that when Schoenberg's music is brilliantly played
and sung, its power to raise complex questions and evoke
otherworldly images overshadows its supposed harshness.
</P>
<P>
   But as the inventor of Serialism _ a system in which he hoped to
skirt the limitations of tonality by treating all notes of the
scale equally and by building themes from predetermined note
sequences and their mutations _ Schoenberg is still reviled by his
detractors for creating what they consider a species of needlessly
complex, dissonant, inexpressive antimusic.
</P>
<P>
   Some composers have agreed with that view. Reacting to the
complexities of Serialism, early Minimalists like Philip Glass and
Steve Reich stripped music to its essentials in the 1960s; they
have spent the last 30 years rebuilding an essentially tonal
language that still avoids the long arching melodies and the rich
chromaticism of the late Romantics, elements that, some Minimalists
have said, led inexorably to Serialism. Minimalism found a large
and sympathetic audience among young listeners, who recognized
elements of popular music in its motoric rhythms and often
amplified textures. But many concertgoers who loathed Serialism
disparaged Minimalism as simplistic, repetitive and droning.
</P>
<P>
   Other currents, like the Neo-Classicism of middle-period
Stravinsky and the Neo-Romanticism of Copland, Barber and Britten,
fared better with the broader public and quickly joined the
standard repertory. But they often struck new-music listeners as
unduly retro.
</P>
<P>
   A generation of eclectic composers like John Corigliano, David
Del Tredici and William Bolcom began a thaw in the cold war between
composers and listeners by taking pages from Serialists and
Neo-Romantics, creating works that have a broad appeal and a clear
connection to modern musical language.
</P>
<P>
   The composers of the current generation _ among them Christopher
Rouse, Aaron Kernis, Richard Danielpour, Michael Daugherty, Michael
Torke and Osvaldo Golijov _ have cast a wider net and brought the
influences of Minimalism, rock and various folk forms into their
discourse.
</P>
<P>
   These last two groups have navigated the minefield of new-music
orthodoxies, and found a path between contemporary and traditional
musical languages. One might expect audiences to feel comfortable
with their works, and perhaps use them to better comprehend early
20th-century styles. Yet many listeners have been so traumatized by
the music they hated in years past that they are disinclined to
listen sympathetically to works by any composers they don't know.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to know what the answer to that is,'' Sachs said,
``because so much of the music that was written in the first half
of the century, and that terrified people, has actually proven
itself by now. I don't think people find Webern or Schoenberg
frightening anymore, if it's a really good performance. I also
don't think the need for a good performance is limited to new
music; there's nothing as deadly as a boring performance of
Beethoven. Unquestionably, the historical record is that there are
many composers whose music did not go over very well at first,
often for very good reasons, including the fact that the first
performances were poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Continuum's first concert, presented under the name Performers'
Committee for Contemporary Music, was an all-Webern program that
Ms. Seltzer, then a graduate student at Columbia University,
assembled with Peter Perrin, a young composer from the West Coast
who was living in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was around that time that a lot of Webern's teen-age works
had come out, and those were the works of his that were getting
performed,'' Ms. Seltzer said, ``and we didn't think those pieces
did credit to Webern. So we said, let's do a concert of his real
music. We rounded up graduate students from various fields to form
a chorus, we had a collaboration with the Beaux-Arts String
Quartet, and we put on a retrospective, as we called it. There was
great attendance and spirit, and people said, why don't you do some
more. So here we are, 33 years later.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Seltzer started the group, Sachs was in Europe working
on his dissertation about the early 19th-century composer Johann
Nepomuk Hummel. Sachs and Ms. Seltzer had met as students at
Marlboro, a summer music school and festival in Vermont, and when
he returned to New York after 15 months in England and Germany, she
invited him to join Continuum in place of Perrin, who had left New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joel and I had both studied composition, although we're not
composers,'' Ms. Seltzer said. ``But we have a wide range of music
that we have strong feelings about, and we saw this as a mission,
something we had to do.'' (Ms. Seltzer added that she and Sachs are
not married. ``People often assume that we are because we've worked
together so long, but we each have families of our own.'')
</P>
<P>
   Continuum, one of several superb ensembles in New York devoted
to contemporary music, is distinguished by its thoughtfully
organized retrospective programs. Most, like the first Webern
concert and the Kirchner retrospective, are portraits of individual
composers. But Continuum regularly steps back to show broader
vistas through surveys of Ukrainian, Japanese or Latin American
composers, works by women or pieces by American composers
influenced by Asian traditional styles.
</P>
<P>
   Continuum's programs are often useful stylistic barometers. The
group devoted evenings to Alfred Schnittke, Arvo Part and Sofia
Gubaidulina before the music of those composers was widely
available on recordings or frequently performed, and left listeners
new to their work with the sense of their individuality, eloquence
and ability to touch a spiritual or emotional core. Its 1972 Scott
Joplin concert preceded by a year the fascination with piano rags
occasioned by ``The Sting,'' the film that used Joplin's music as a
central element of its soundtrack. That concert also showed that
Continuum took a nondoctrinaire view of what constituted serious,
important 20th-century music.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really have always primarily been interested in getting to
the general musical public, not just the specialists,'' Ms. Seltzer
said. ``We have tailored our programs with an eye toward making the
concert, as a whole, intelligible to a listener who is open, if
maybe untutored. That's why the retrospective format is helpful. It
gives the music a context, much as you find in an exhibition at an
art museum. Most composers have some grounding in the earlier
traditions that they come from.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we played our first Webern retrospective, for example, we
began with an early a cappella piece for chorus that comes out of
the late 19th-century Wagner-Liszt-Strauss tradition. People are
comfortable with it, and with that as a bridge they'll have the
good will to listen to the composer's more advanced work, and then
perhaps to get a recording and give it another hearing.''
</P>
<P>
   Having pondered the problem of winning audiences for new music
for more than three decades, Sachs and Ms. Seltzer have lots of
ideas, practical and philosophical, about how it can be done. To
begin with, they program only music to which they are committed. If
they disagree on a work or a composer, they don't do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to be careful,'' Sachs said. ``Sometimes you do a piece
that you think is going to be really good, and it turns out not to
sustain itself. That's unavoidable when you do new pieces. But it
has been rare. We do our best to find pieces we can stand behind,
so that if an audience member asks if we really like it, we can say
yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Choosing the group's roster is crucial as well. Continuum uses a
flexible lineup of musicians, with a handful of singers and a
nucleus of seven players _ usually David Gresham, clarinetist;
Renee Jolles and Tom Chiu, violinists; Kenji Bunch, violist;
Kristina Reiko Cooper, cellist, and Sachs and Ms. Seltzer,
pianists, with Sachs sometimes conducting. By drawing on other New
York musicians, as well as Juilliard students and recent graduates,
the ensemble can be expanded to chamber orchestra proportions, as
it was on the recent Paris trip.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We also look for players who are good talkers,'' Sachs said.
``And one of the things we try to impress upon students at
Juilliard, increasingly, is the importance of being articulate,
because especially if we have a residency, we need to be able to
talk to the audience. That makes a big difference in the audience's
response. Even if it's a few words, the audience feels that you're
a person, not a workaday musician who plays for a living, but
someone playing music you really like.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you can get them to listen to a piece that they're
not disposed towards by giving them the sense that you think it's
important, not intellectually but esthetically, and that you love
it and want to share it with them,'' Sachs explained.
</P>
<P>
   Giving the audience a chance to hear new works more than once is
also crucial, and at Continuum's residencies, the musicians often
play excerpts and important passages before the performance to get
the composer's language in listeners' ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was moderating a panel at the University of Maryland,''
Sachs said, ``a woman in the audience said that one of the problems
with new music was that you hear it once and never have time to
come to terms with it. But she described a concert at the
Smithsonian where the Juilliard Quartet was playing a quartet by
Elliott Carter. About 40 bars into the piece, Joel Krosnick broke a
string. So he fixed it and started again. Not far from the same
spot, Sammy Rhodes broke a string, so they started again. And would
you believe that the third time, Joel Smirnoff broke a string? That
time, they fixed it and went on. But this woman said that hearing
the opening of the quartet three times unlocked the whole piece for
her.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Seltzer, reaching listeners who have not formed
attitudes about new music is also important. In her other job, as
director of young people's programs at the Elaine Kaufman Cultural
Center and its Lucy Moses School for Music and Dance, she is laying
the groundwork by overseeing a program in which student musicians
learn contemporary works, at various levels, for performances at an
annual marathon concert. This year's, on Feb. 7, was devoted to
female composers. Cecile Chaminade, Lili Boulanger, Ms.
Gubaidulina, Amy Beach, Ellen Taaffe Zwilich, Ursula Mamlok and
Naomi Shemer were among those represented.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this were done more universally, we'd have audiences that
are more open,'' Ms. Seltzer said, but added that she has also seen
older students with no musical background become enthusiastic about
new works. One involved a Continuum retrospective of Carter's
music, in 1971. Students in a Columbia University humanities class
were asked to write their impressions. One student, a football
player, wrote that the early Carter works on the program _ works
written in an easygoing, tonal idiom _ left him cold. But he loved
the much thornier Double Concerto for Harpsichord and Piano.
</P>
<P>
   ``That work,'' Ms. Seltzer said, ``made him think of
constellations and heavenly bodies flying around; he evoked all
sorts of images. If people are receptive, then whatever terms they
can muster are fine. If the performance gets them to explore a bit,
then there's a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Continuum's Leon Kirchner retrospective Saturday is the
ensemble's third concert devoted to that composer and celebrates
his 80th birthday, which was on Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to show all the phases of his work,'' said Cheryl
Seltzer, co-director of the group, who was a student of Kirchner at
Mills College in Oakland, Calif., ``although in his music you don't
find the huge stylistic changes you sometimes find with other
composers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you consider all the changes in fashion, his music has
stood up through it all,'' she said. ``He's also great to coach
with. When you work with composers, you're lucky if they say
anything about what they want in a performance. But he makes it a
creative experience because he'll want to change things. It's truly
a structured improvisation.''
</P>
<P>
   The group will perform Kirchner's Sonata Concertante for violin
and piano (1952); the String Quartet No. 3, for strings and tape
(1966), which won a Pulitzer Prize; ``Flutings,'' a solo flute work
from Kirchner's opera, ``Lily'' (1973); a song cycle, ``The
Twilight Stood'' (1982); the lyrical Trio No. 2 (1993), and ``For
the Left Hand'' (1995), a piano work composed for Leon Fleischer.
</P>
<P>
   Continuum will also offer a Paul Schoenfield retrospective this
year. Schoenfield is an eclectic composer whose music draws on folk
music, from country fiddling to klezmer and jazz. Sachs described
Schoenfield as ``one of these amazingly exuberant composers who
writes very difficult, very virtuosic music that is tremendous fun
to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The program includes a sextet for winds, strings and piano; a
work about the Holocaust, ``Sparks of Glory,'' for narrator and
four instruments; the ``Boogie-Woogie'' for piano four-hands, and
the popular ``Four Country Fiddle Tunes.''
</P>
<P>
   Both concerts are at Merkin Concert Hall, 129 W. 67th St.,
Manhattan, (212) 501-3330. The Kirchner concert Saturday is at 8
p.m. The Schoenfield concert is on April 10 at 8:30 p.m. Tickets
for each program: $12.50; $6 for students and the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs will conduct the New Juilliard Ensemble in works by
Justine Fang Chen, Mason Bates, Liu Sola, Stefano Gervasoni and Lee
Hyla next Friday at 8 p.m., at Alice Tully Hall, (212) 875-5050.
Admission is free.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The immediate reaction of some Republicans to the
possibility that Hillary Clinton might run for the Senate in New
York was to revive their old patronizing put-downs, mocking her
unelected status as first lady and her current image as The Wronged
Wife.
</P>
<P>
   They haven't learned a thing about this smart, tough cookie in
the six years she has been in the White House. They still
underestimate her.
</P>
<P>
   This is not Rep. Geraldine Ferraro, burdened with questions
about her baking skills and trapped in the traditional bias against
women in politics while she campaigned as the first female vice
presidential nominee in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   This is the turn of the century, 15 years later. Although still
a minority, women have been accepted in every major leadership role
but the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   And Hillary Clinton has been the premier role model for millions
of women ever since we discovered her political poise, daunting
intelligence, practiced speaking style and deep involvement in
national issues. She is the only first lady since Eleanor Roosevelt
to speak and lobby regularly and openly on major public policy
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have always known where they stood on President
Clinton. From the beginning, they despised him, his programs, his
budgets, his informal country-boy manner. But Hillary baffles them.
She has remade her image as often as her husband has _ and with
even more political success.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1992 presidential campaign and the GOP national
convention in Houston, Republicans singled her out as a symbol of
rotten family values, calling her a ``radical feminist''
preoccupied with her career rather than her hearthstone. She was
portrayed as overly ambitious and contemptuous toward homemakers.
Former President Richard Nixon, whose own wife had so little to say
she was dubbed Plastic Pat, mused that Hillary threatened her
husband's campaign by making him look weak.
</P>
<P>
   But the attacks on her backfired. Working mothers identified
with her, and their support contributed to the widening gender gap
and Clinton's election.
</P>
<P>
   Still the Republicans didn't get it. When she crusaded for
national health reform in 1993, she gave as good as she got in five
appearances on Capitol Hill, demonstrating her substantive
knowledge of the subject before skeptical lawmakers. She so
astonished Texas Rep. Richard Armey, now the House minority leader,
that he snapped, ``The reports on your charm are overstated and the
reports on your wit are understated.''
</P>
<P>
   The complex health reform package went down to humiliating
defeat and remains her one big political negative. It will enable
any Senate opponent to tag her as a big-spending, big-government
activist. But in liberal, cosmopolitan New York state that is not
the pejorative label it would be in the conservative South.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the first lady has made countless speeches on
behalf of Clinton administration policies, crusaded for women's
rights both at home and abroad and campaigned for a long list of
Democratic candidates. She has come through the nightmare of her
husband's sex scandal with her dignity and popularity intact.
</P>
<P>
   It is time for her to seek elective office in her own right. She
shouldn't wait any longer if she is interested in a march to the
White House. Ironically, Elizabeth Dole is already out there ahead
of her, trying with a presidential campaign to prove to the
Republicans just how wrong-headed they are to scoff at women with
professional careers.
</P>
<P>
   Dismissing the first lady's influence and importance because her
name has never been on a ballot is tired old stuff. Yet
conservatives still ridicule the fact that her job approval ratings
are high, contending she has no ``job.''
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution, written when women were uneducated and could
not vote or even move freely in polite society without a husband,
makes no mention of the president's wife. There were no Founding
Mothers in the room when the Founding Fathers produced that
document.
</P>
<P>
   First ladies are less than full public servants. They take no
oath of office, perform no statutory function and cannot be fired
like appointed administration officials if they mess up. But
Hillary Clinton, more than any previous first lady, has fashioned a
``job'' out of that murky legal vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia agreed
that hers was a real job in March 1993, after groups that opposed
her health reforms sued to be allowed to participate in her
meetings developing the legislation. They argued that she was a
private citizen not on the federal payroll (by law she cannot be
paid a salary) and therefore subject to federal rules requiring
public hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Pragmatically, the court ruled that she was ``the functional
equivalent of an assistant to the president,'' making her a
quasi-public servant not covered by the law. The three judges also
noted the fading of the traditional perception of a president's
wife ``as a virtual extension of her husband.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Democrats in New York want her desperately.
Carpetbaggers are welcome there. And it is nice to be wanted. Her
party is offering her the sun, moon and stars if she will just be
theirs.
</P>
<P>
   It will be up to the Republicans to finally see her as a woman
who is tough-minded and works like a dog instead of the hen-pecking
feminist horror they wish her to be. It is the only way they could
have a chance of beating her.
</P>
<P>
   A move to New York, which could legally be done virtually at the
last minute, would encourage speculation that she is separating
from the president left behind in Washington and will get a
divorce. Robert Kennedy, however, managed to become a senator from
New York while his wife and children continued living in McLean,
Va., without undue scandal. Hillary Clinton can do it too _ if she
wants.

   The New York Times News Service will move the following
entertainment/arts articles this week for release Sunday, Feb. 21,
1999. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ENTERTAINMENT &AMP; ARTS (Moved in `e' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FEATURE STORY  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BRITISH/AMERICAN-THEATER (Undated) _ A conversation between
three New York Times theater critics on British and American
theater, which was recorded by the theater editor of Arts and
Leisure, Andrea Stevens. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CARLOS-SAURA-FILMS (Undated) _ This year's Academy Award
nominations offer many reasons for deep satisfaction, but one such
reason hasn't attracted much attention. Tucked at the end of the
list of nominees for best foreign film, just below Roberto
Benigni's ubiquitous ``Life Is Beautiful,'' is ``Tango,'' an entry
from Argentina that is the work of the hugely gifted, hugely
perplexing Spanish director Carlos Saura. It would be wonderful in
any case for the 67-year-old Saura to be noted again for Oscar
consideration (his ``Carmen'' was nominated in 1983). By Will
Joyner. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   RISA-GARCIA-FILMS (Undated) _ In 1973, Risa Bramon Garcia turned
her first nobody into a star. His name was Martin, and she didn't
care that he had no acting experience. ``It's not just that he had
(italics)presence,''(end italics) said Ms. Garcia, who was then 16
and directing a high school production of ``South Pacific.'' ``He
had a beautiful singing voice. I knew that because he used to sit
behind me in history class and hum.'' Now 42, Ms. Garcia still has
ears and eyes for talent. Over the past 15 years she has become a
top casting director in Hollywood. With ``200 Cigarettes,'' which
opens on Friday, Ms. Garcia's 94-minute romantic comedy marks her
debut as a feature film director. By Margy Rochlin. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   APPLE-FILM (Undated) _ ``The Apple,'' an astonishing directorial
debut by Samira Makhmalbaf, written and edited by her father,
Mohsen Makhmalbaf, won praise when it screened at the Cannes
International Film Festival last spring, but it also provoked a
certain confusion. ``One critic asked: `What kind of country is
Iran?' '' Ms. Makhmalbaf recalled, speaking animatedly in a mixture
of English and Farsi. `` `Is it a place where 12-year-old girls are
incarcerated, or where 18-year-old girls make movies?' '' The film,
which opened in New York on Friday after screening in the New York
Film Festival last fall, is both a realistic recreation of surreal
events and a subtle allegory about the need for liberty. By Leslie
Camhi. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CANBY-THEATER (Undated) _ Vincent Canby reviews: ``Death of a
Salesman''; ``The Misanthrope'' and ``James Naughton: Street of
Dreams.'' (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   YANKS-ENGLISH-THEATER (Undated) _ While it may seem to Americans
that British theater people stream across the Atlantic in a
constant one-way flow, the current runs both ways. Americans can _
and do _ flourish in English theater. Six expatriates offer their
observations. By Matt Wolf. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   JUDI-DENCH-THEATER (London) _ Since she took over the role of
the spymaster M in the James Bond movies, and came close to winning
an Oscar for her portrayal of Queen Victoria in ``Mrs. Brown,''
Judi Dench's mailbag has vastly increased. She has become
accustomed to getting letters, mostly from America, asking her
where she has been hiding and what acting she has done. &UR;  &LR; If she
were a pedantic person, she might reply that, well, she has been
playing leading roles in the theater for four decades and that her
work onstage won her the title of Dame of the British Empire in
1988. &UR;  &LR; But she has long been a stranger to Broadway and the
American stage. When she opens at the Ethel Barrymore Theater in
David Hare's ``Amy's View'' on April 15, it will be her first
appearance in New York in 40 years. By Benedict Nightingale.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BRITISH-AMERICANS-ACTORS (Undated) _ The trade agreement
governing the number of British and American actors working on
opposite sides of the Atlantic is under attack by Britain's main
international cultural agency, prompting hopes that the unions
involved will reconsider the arrangement. Under the current rules,
a producer who wants to bring a British actor to New York must seek
the approval of Actors Equity, the American union, just as British
Equity's approval is needed to allow an American actor to go to
Britain. In theory, the two unions try to balance the exchange. By
Felicia R. Lee. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   CORIN-REDGRAVE-THEATER (subslug) (London) _ There will be two
unfamiliar entities onstage when ``Not About Nightingales'' opens
on Thursday at Circle in the Square on Broadway. First, of course,
will be Tennessee Williams's fierce, lyrical prison play, having
its belated New York premiere 61 years after it was written. And
second, playing the central role of the warden, will be Corin
Redgrave, who has not been on Broadway since 1963 and who is the
least known of the famous acting Redgraves. In addition to what Ben
Brantley, writing in The New York Times, called an ``outsize,
Satanic'' performance as Boss Whalen in ``Not About Nightingales,''
Redgrave has been acclaimed in productions of plays by Martin
Sherman (``Some Sunny Day''), Richard Nelson (``The General From
America'') and Noel Coward (``A Song at Twilight''), as well as
onscreen as Sir Walter Elliot in ``Persuasion.'' By Matt Wolf.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ANGLO-IRISH-PLAYS (Undated) _ In the 10 weeks between now and
the cutoff date at the end of April for Tony Award nominations, a
crowd of visitors from the British Isles will be taking their
places on New York stages. Last season around this time,
theatergoers were anticipating a similar Anglo-Irish delivery of
plays, performers and directors. And next season is already shaping
up as a busy one for London imports. By Andrea Stevens. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SHAPERO-CLASSICAL-SYMPHONY (Undated) _ The history of music is
filled with accounts of major new works that received prominent
premieres only to languish thereafter and sometimes virtually
disappear. Take the Symphony for Classical Orchestra by the
respected American Neo-Classical composer Harold Shapero. Shapero
was 27 when he completed this 45-minute work, which was given its
promising first performance in January 1948 by the Boston Symphony
Orchestra and Leonard Bernstein, who was then 29. Two months later,
George Szell conducted it with the Cleveland Orchestra. And in
1953, Bernstein and the Columbia Symphony Orchestra recorded the
piece in New York, producing a remarkable performance that
circulated for years and won the symphony admirers among musicians
and composers sympathetic to Neo-Classicism. That recording, long
unavailable, has now been reissued by Sony Classical in its
Bernstein Century series (SMK 60725; CD). By Anthony Tommasini.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   GRAMMOPHON-CDs (Undated) _ Three decades ago, Deutsche
Grammophon annually put out a smartly presented series of half a
dozen disks called Avant-Garde, recording the year's crop of new
music, at least as it might have appeared to a listener in Germany
at the time of Karlheinz Stockhausen's apogee. Well, there is no
avant-garde anymore, and the company's new 20/21 series inevitably
takes a different approach to contemporary music: different in
every respect except for the effort that has gone into graphic
design. By Paul Griffiths. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BLONDIE-MUSIC (New York) _ ``Do you really want to know the
whole odd story?'' asked the guitarist Chris Stein, peering
skeptically across the coffee table in a midtown hotel suite. He
was explaining why Blondie, the punk era's best-selling group and,
later, one of its many train wrecks, has regrouped after 16 years
to record ``No Exit,'' an album of new studio material. By Ann
Powers. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MORELL-PHOTOGS (Boston) _ The exhibition ``Abelardo Morell and
the Camera Eye,'' at the Museum of Fine Arts through April 11,
documents Morell's pictures from the point of view of a child with
70 images. It was organized by Diana Gaston, curator at the Museum
of Photographic Arts in San Diego, Calif. By Deborah Weisgall.
(Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   HAPPENINGS-ART (Undated) _ With ``Off Limits: Rutgers University
and the Avant-Garde, 1957-1963,'' the Newark Museum has organized
an illuminating exhibition about one of modern art's lesser-known
but pivotal creative scenes. It unfolded at a moment when the art
world was transfixed by the apotheosis of Abstract Expressionism,
and still-nascent Pop Art had yet to emerge. The time was the late
50s and early 60s, when a mutually influential group of artists,
teachers and students came together at the Rutgers College and
Douglass College campuses in New Brunswick. There, they came up
with radical notions and rule-breaking experiments that helped sow
the seeds of performance art, installation art, conceptual art, Pop
Art and the international current in art known as Fluxus. ``Off
Limits,'' which traces this art-historical path, focuses on the
ideas and early work of Allan Kaprow, Robert Watts, George Segal,
Geoffrey Hendricks, Robert Whitman, Lucas Samaras, George Brecht
and Roy Lichtenstein, examining some of the better known of these
artists' work in unexpected contexts. The show opened Thursday and
will remain on view through May 16. By Edward M. GOMEZ. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-LANSKY (Los Angeles) _ For his first television movie, David
Mamet has chosen as his subject the gangster Meyer Lansky and
attracted a strong cast that includes Richard Dreyfuss (as a
largely quiet and introspective Lansky), Eric Roberts, Anthony
LaPaglia, Illeana Douglas and Max Perlich. Most of the typical
elements are there _ rubouts, skimming and double-crosses _ as the
movie, directed by John McNaughton, follows Lansky from his native
Poland to the streets of New York in the early part of the century
and finally to Miami Beach in the 1970s. But ``Lansky,'' which will
have its premiere on HBO Saturday night at 8, is a deeply unusual
picture. It defies many of the conventions of its two genres,
gangster films and made-for-television movies. By James Sterngold.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANTIQUES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-BASKETS-ANTIQUES (Undated) _ Lloyd E. Cotsen, a
mega-collector of ordinary and offbeat objects that most people
ignore, goes to great lengths to share them with the public.
Cotsen, who is 69 and lives in Los Angeles, is letting the public
view his most treasured artifacts _ Japanese bamboo baskets. The
900 baskets in his collection, which is considered the largest and
most distinguished in private hands, are a type of artifact that is
virtually unknown to all but a small group of experts, even in
Japan, where such objects are seldom exhibited. So Cotsen lent 100
rarities to the Asia Society in Manhattan for ``Bamboo Masterworks:
Japanese Baskets from the Lloyd Cotsen Collection,'' a show on view
through May 30. By Rita Reif. (Moved).

A BARTENDER MAKES A FILM; HISPANIC MOVIES WITH OR WITHOUT A
CROSSOVER AUDIENCE; NEW ANIMATION TECHNOLOGY FROM PIXAR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ireland, Mexico, Calif.)   By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barry McEvoy is a sometime actor and bartender from Northern
Ireland who takes few things too seriously except his desire to
make good in his chosen field. Movies, not pouring booze. So when
he finished writing his first script, a story about two barbers
trying to make a go of it as hairpiece salesmen in Belfast, he did
what seemed like the wise thing; he made a deal with the owner of
the bar where he worked, in the East Village in Manhattan, to
produce the film.
</P>
<P>
   Funnier things may have happened, but not much. Funnier yet, the
film is being made with McEvoy , 31, in one of the lead parts and
an enthusiastic group of producers behind the project.
</P>
<P>
   One of the producers of ``An Everlasting Piece'' is still Jerome
O'Connor, who owns St. Dymphnas Restaurant and Bar. ``That's the
patron saint of insane people, which me and Jerome are,'' McEvoy
explained.
</P>
<P>
   McEvoy also has teamed up with Mark Johnson, the highly
successful producer of films like ``Rain Man'' and ``Donnie
Brasco,'' and Louis DiGiamo, who has been a casting director as
well as a producer.
</P>
<P>
   McEvoy, who also grew up partly in Washington, where his father,
a former hairpiece salesman, owns a barber shop, has had some
success with acting. He played a gangster alongside Sharon Stone in
``Gloria,'' and several years ago he performed in a production of
Harold Pinter's ``Moonlight,'' with Jason Robards and Blythe
Danner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was getting a lot of the brooding young man stuff,'' McEvoy
said, adding that he wrote the script partly to change that.
</P>
<P>
   The movie begins when two barbers, one Catholic and one
Protestant, are cutting the hair of inmates at an asylum. They
notice one day that the local owner of a hairpiece company has been
brought in in a straitjacket, putting him out of business.
</P>
<P>
   The barbers realize that opportunity is knocking and form a new
hairpiece company. The problem is that every time they visit a
neighborhood, one or the other is unwelcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just trying to make a buck, but it's Northern Ireland
and the 80s,'' McEvoy said. ``They get sucked into the
`Troubles.'''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the movie was an effort to use comedy to make a more
serious point, McEvoy brushed the notion aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is the people of Northern Ireland would go to any
lengths not to be sentimental,'' McEvoy said. ``They don't want to
be mushy, ever. If I want to tell my parents I love them, I say,
`Can I get you a cup of tea?' So no, the movie is about
hairpieces.''
</P>
<P>
   The Latino Market &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Latino film market always has been tricky. It has great
potential, since it is estimated that roughly 15 percent of movie
tickets are sold to Latinos, and there is a huge potential market
for movies in Latin America. But films that are too specific to the
culture or that are in Spanish risk alienating mainstream American
audiences, while movies that aim at the mainstream can lose their
authenticity and turn off Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, for the first time a major studio has decided to
pursue the market with a regular slate of films, in English, over
the next several years. New Line has signed an agreement with the
Latino director and writer Gregory Nava that opens an interesting
window on a large ethnic group usually ignored by Hollywood and
that could lead to more targeting of other niche movie markets.
</P>
<P>
   Nava received an Oscar nomination for his screenplay for ``El
Norte,'' a film about the United States-Mexican border, which was
released in 1984. Since then he has written and directed, among
others, ``Mi Familia'' and ``Selena.''
</P>
<P>
   Nava grew up in San Diego and he said he frequently visited
family members in Tijuana, giving him firsthand experiences with
the collision of the two cultures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The really important thing is that making these films always
has been a one-time thing before,'' Nava said. ``To really succeed
in this market, you have to make a concerted effort to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that he was considering three films: a drama about the
border region, a comedy about the clash of cultures in Los Angeles
and an adaptation of Victor Villasenor's novel ``Rain of Gold.''
</P>
<P>
   New Line and Nava are hoping the films will cross over and
attract broad audiences, but they are trying to focus on making
them appealing to Latinos first.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you control the budgets and don't spend like you're
expecting the crossover, it can work,'' said Michael De Luca, the
president of New Line Productions.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the films would cost $3 million to $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   Nava added that another goal was to unite the many constituents
in the Hispanic audience, which includes groups from Mexicans to
Puerto Ricans, Cubans and South Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big part of this is finding the common identity of
Latinos,'' Nava said. ``We do have to bring the audience together.
These movies can't succeed without getting a good audience in New
York, and New York is mostly Puerto Rican.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, he emphasized, the focus has to be not on marketing
but on telling good stories, and that will be the real challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I sit down at my computer, I don't think of any of
this,'' Nava said. ``If you try to do all those things you end up
with scrambled eggs.''
</P>
<P>
   Animation Technology &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And you thought you knew Buzz and Woody.
</P>
<P>
   Pixar Animation Studios is doing two of the things it does best,
only one of which is well known. As just about every 7{-year-old
knows, the animation studio is busy at work on ``Toy Story 2,'' the
sequel to one of the most profitable films of all time. The movie
is scheduled to be released, through Disney, at Thanksgiving,
following up Pixar's big success last year, ``A Bug's Life.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pixar has been busy at something else that is a significant
part of its activities. It has developed a new technology that the
studio promises will make the new ``Toy Story'' even sharper and
more brilliant _ another step, executives say, in the evolution of
animation as the technological cutting edge of moviemaking.
</P>
<P>
   The technology's developer, David DiFrancesco of Pixar, has won
a special Academy Award for the device. The award will be presented
by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences on Feb. 27.
</P>
<P>
   The new technology has the prosaic name Pixarvision, but it is a
complex device that DiFrancesco said he has been working on for
roughly 20 years and that is just a step in the transition to fully
electronic, digital moviemaking.
</P>
<P>
   Until now animators could produce great characters and images on
their computers, but it had been difficult to generate film prints
from those electronic versions that were just as visually stunning.
The new device, called a digital laser film recorder, produces far
sharper and more vivid film prints with better color and contrast.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this they will be able to produce on film exactly what
the art director sees on the computer monitor,'' DiFrancesco said.
``The tool chest for what the animators can use now is
overflowing.''
</P>
<P>
   The result will be not a new Buzz and Woody but, DiFrancesco
said, visually more distinctive characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This began years ago when I discovered that there was not a
good way to get pictures into the computer and absolutely no way to
get them out,'' DiFrancesco said. ``This is a step in a process
that eventually is going to lead to all digital moviemaking.''

 &HT;    It takes sole to pound the pavement
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Me . . . a foot fetishist? Under normal circumstances
that notion would never fly. But this is Fashion Week, which means:
Nothing's normal. And the mad dashes from runway to showroom and
back have made feet _ mine and others' _ an overpowering obsession.
</P>
<P>
   How on earth does InStyle magazine editor Hal Rubenstein make it
through a day wearing cowboy boots? And what were those fashion
groupies, who turned out for the shows with bare legs and open-toed
sandals, thinking? And where did a Dallas newspaper editor get the
chutzpah to sit in the front row wearing a pair of trail-running
shoes by Adidas?
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, where can I find (and afford) a pair of those
ultramodern, molded-sole shoes that the chicest of the chic
gathered here are wearing?
</P>
<P>
   After I hoofed up and down Fifth Avenue and scavenged all over
SoHo, the best of the choices appear to be these: Barney's New York
sells a house-brand version for $195 that's high on the quality
end, but a bit staid when it comes to style; Banana Republic has a
$124 loafer version that looks versatile enough to go from day to
evening, and Kenneth Cole has a shoe he calls ``Sneak Around''
selling for $180 that can be described only as ``sporty.''
</P>
<P>
   Common sense tells me the Banana Republic shoes would be more
practical, but my dogs keep barking, ``Go sporty, Shorty.'' No
matter what, I'm buying new kicks by nightfall. And I'll probably
listen to man's best friend.

A LAND FOR ALL SEASONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Yesterday as I write this _ two days ago as
you read it _ my wife and I took a walk together in our city
neighborhood at a mellow hour of late afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The sky was cloudless, the sun warm. We were comfortable in only
sweaters, and the little edge of crispness in the air seemed less
like real winter than the memory of a winter already passing.
</P>
<P>
   In our hearts, we'd made the turn toward spring.
</P>
<P>
   This morning, just a night and part of a morning later, as I sit
working beside my window here, I'm watching as the freeze-browned
lawn turns white under falling snow.
</P>
<P>
   And that, I have realized suddenly, is one of the great rewards
of living in this midlands place _ the splendid capriciousness of
our seasons.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago I heard a man say he'd begun thinking of the turkey
woods in greening time, and of sitting by his tree before daylight
while the big birds muttered from the roost.
</P>
<P>
   That day, at dawning, the temperature was in the 50s, and by
afternoon in the 70s.
</P>
<P>
   Another morning we drove to the farm on an errand. And when our
business was finished we ambled down the woodland path to the pond,
and looked in at the cabin to see how vast a population of mice had
colonized the place.
</P>
<P>
   But there wasn't a one to be found anywhere. Thinking the cold
finished, I suppose, they'd all gone back out _ as field mice are
wont to do _ to make their spring nests in burrows under stones and
in the hollows of fallen trees.
</P>
<P>
   About that same time there were reports of wild geese northing
by the tens of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   So we humans aren't the only dupes. There are things alive in
this world with experience longer than ours, who also are subject
to being fooled.
</P>
<P>
   Here at the plains' edge, it is possible to have sweet April and
frigid February all in the space of a day or two. And it is this
quality of surprise that gives our place its special character.
</P>
<P>
   I've known the tropics, where there are but two seasons, hot and
dry, wet and hotter. Such weather stultifies the mind and steals
ambition.
</P>
<P>
   And I've been to places of the extreme north, up by the polar
sea, where there is no ambiguity at all about the seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Spring and summer and autumn are so cruelly brief there as to be
almost one _ three months at most. When the long freeze comes, it
comes without relief, so fierce and unrelenting that those spirits
obliged to endure it never seem quite to thaw.
</P>
<P>
   When we came back from our city walk, we crossed the yard to the
winter ruin of last year's garden. And were pleased to see that, up
through the dry stalks, the bulbs of hyacinths, jonquils and
surprise lilies had thrust their fat, green spears.
</P>
<P>
   I remembered what the man had said about the turkey woods, and
suddenly I couldn't wait to be there.
</P>
<P>
   But that was yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Outside my window just now the snow is coming faster, heavier.
The flakes are as large as quarters, some larger. Every branch and
twig in the barren latticework of the trees is limed white on its
upper side.
</P>
<P>
   And I cannot wait to finish work and be out in it.
</P>
<P>
   Just as I believe I could sit a lifetime against a tree in the
spring forest, I can imagine walking an eternity through a snow
like this one, with a biscuit and a piece of fried rabbit in my
pocket and a warm fire to rest beside from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   The gift of living in this place is that one doesn't have to
choose. We have it all.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 21)  
 (af)  
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three decades ago, Deutsche Grammophon annually put out a
smartly presented series of half a dozen disks called Avant-Garde,
recording the year's crop of new music, at least as it might have
appeared to a listener in Germany at the time of Karlheinz
Stockhausen's apogee.
</P>
<P>
   Well, there is no avant-garde anymore, and the company's new
20/21 series inevitably takes a different approach to contemporary
music: different in every respect except for the effort that has
gone into graphic design.
</P>
<P>
   Ten releases are planned each year, featuring music by composers
from Elliott Carter to Arvo Part by way of Leonard Bernstein. Among
the first five CDs are Mauricio Kagel's ``1898'' (459 570-2), a
reissue of a work written for Deutsche Grammophon's 75th
anniversary, which was a kind of documentary sounding back to the
early days of recording; Andre Previn's opera ``A Streetcar Named
Desire'' (459 366-2; three CDs); Luciano Berio's complete
``Sequenzas'' for soloists (457 038-2; three CDs); two works with
electronics by Pierre Boulez (457 605-2), and orchestral music by
Toru Takemitsu (453 495-2).
</P>
<P>
   The range is broad, and in a way it reflects the fall of the
walls in the world of new music. Where the old Avant-Garde series
kept Kagel well insulated from the likes of Shostakovich and
Barber, 20/21 cheerfully aligns him with Previn. By the doctrine of
the 60s, there were entirely separate and mutually antagonistic
schools of composition.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for 20/21, there is no separation and no antagonism.
Kagel's quirky, ironic, playful piece takes nothing for granted;
Previn's opera takes everything. Both are here.
</P>
<P>
   But though one should not undervalue diversity, such benign
openness speaks of a floppy personality. There may be no rules
anymore, but the corollary of freedom is the need and the
obligation to decide, for we define ourselves by our choices.
Twenty/Twenty-One hardly defines itself at all.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one struggles to imagine a sensibility that could regard
both Kagel and Previn as among the most vigorous composers of our
time. The series has, as yet, no voice.
</P>
<P>
   For an example of what is missing, consider Manfred Eicher's ECM
label. Eicher is bound by no dogma: his most recent CDs include
Jean Barraque's Piano Sonata (ECM 1621), in which postwar Serialism
meets the demands of Beethoven, and Alfred Schnittke's ``Psalms of
Repentance'' (ECM 1583), studies in a gray and silver style of
Russian Orthodox chant.
</P>
<P>
   These musical worlds have almost nothing in common, except that
Eicher appreciates them both and they both chime with his earlier
productions, which have a sure center in solemnity and a nostalgia
for Christian ritual.
</P>
<P>
   Like any artist, Eicher, by expressing his personality, has
gained his audience's trust, and there must be many who came to him
for Keith Jarrett or Part and stayed for Gyorgy Kurtag and Heinz
Holliger. Twenty/Twenty-One, until it gains that kind of
personality, will lack that kind of trust.
</P>
<P>
   What it also lacks, so far, is any commitment to younger
composers. All of those represented on releases announced to date
were born before 1935; most are in their 70s, and two are dead. The
project's explicit ambition to survive into the next century hangs
by a slender thread.
</P>
<P>
   More than that, its catholicity is awkwardly compromised.
Twenty/Twenty-One looks set to cover any kind of music, provided
that it comes from a composer with a distinguished resume. Risk,
which ought to be the life of a new-music series, is absent.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Without risk, too, 20/21 looks like a way of marketing
recordings that Deutsche Grammophon would have been releasing
anyway. The Previn opera is a natural follow-up to ``A Quiet
Place,'' by Bernstein. Berio's ``Sequenzas'' have long been in
preparation and are contemporary classics.
</P>
<P>
   The disk of Boulez's music is in a line of recordings he has
been making for the company in the 90s, presenting his own works as
well as other 20th-century pieces, and the Takemitsu anthology is
part of a newer association with the conductor and composer Oliver
Knussen.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite all these doubts, the first releases in the
series include choice items. Berio's ``Sequenzas,'' a sequence of
solos for different instruments (including voice), are feats of
musical imagination and memory, and they are spectacularly
performed here.
</P>
<P>
   The later pieces are done by the musicians for whom they were
written: the guitarist Eliot Fisk, the bassoonist Pascal Gallois
and the accordionist Teodoro Anzellotti. Others are played by
members of the Ensemble Intercontemporain, who make the music their
own, which is part of the point. Under the hands of Florent
Boffard, for example, the piano ``Sequenza'' seems to keep stopping
to collect itself just when it is about to slip into something by
Debussy.
</P>
<P>
   Berio is a theater composer, and he made his ``Sequenzas'' with
an eye and an ear to the drama of musical performance. Often what
he writes is not only a sound but also a physical action: a
violist's scrubbing, a violinist's tasting of the same note on
different strings, a trumpeter's swinging the instrument in the
air.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the music's excitement, too, is the circus thrill of
being present while extremely gifted people do extremely difficult
things. But these recordings transmit much of the atmosphere of
daring, and in some cases the music even makes gains from the
intimacy of private listening.
</P>
<P>
   An outstanding example is Alain Damiens' beautiful performance
of the clarinet ``Sequenza,'' which begins like warm chocolate and
becomes brilliant virtuosity, as if Brahms were turning into jazz.
This might be the place to start. Or try Gallois' almost
unbelievable bending bassoon, gliding in pitch and continuing for
almost 20 minutes without pause, or the accordion piece, latest in
the cycle, which sounds like an oily river going sluggishly through
a modern city while remembering its sparkling youth in the
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Damiens is heard again playing Boulez's ``Dialogue de l'Ombre
Double,'' another gripping performance. The piece is literally a
dialogue: the clarinet plays a passage and is answered by an
electronically transformed version of its own voice. The scene is
ambiguous.
</P>
<P>
   Is there one personality here or two? Or is there one playing
against many: the different distorted images? Are we witnessing a
confession or an inquisition, or a seduction, as the allusion to
the clarinet solos from Bartok's ``Miraculous Mandarin'' suggests?
And at whose expense are the jokes?
</P>
<P>
   The companion work is ``Repons,'' which is much more flamboyant,
being scored for a chamber orchestra with six soloists on tuned
percussion instruments, all electronically enlarged and altered.
The opening is marvelous: the orchestra rushes about, looking for a
way to start, or a way out, and then prepares for the grand
entrance of the soloists.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the sounds are also fabulous: violins putting a whisker
on rich, deep chimes, or electric zigzags of tone. But
``Dialogue,'' on the surface so severe, says more.
</P>
<P>
   These are exciting releases. Excitement over 20/21 as a whole
will have to wait.

MAYBE WE'VE BEEN DUMBSIZED IN COLLEGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be college
graduates.
</P>
<P>
   We once heard that higher education was an employment insurance
policy. Nowadays, high school counselors are telling parents they
may want to rethink college priorities for their children.
</P>
<P>
   They say many jobs now and in the future won't require Chaucer.
They'll require HTML programming or other technical skills acquired
in less time and at less cost than a four-year degree.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, I fear the loss of the Renaissance man (and woman). I also
fear the future is here. The evidence:
</P>
<P>
   At a careers fair sponsored Monday by the Kansas City Star Co.,
the careers news desk had 455 attendees return brief questionnaires
about why they came to the jobs fair. Of the 455, 260 were from
employed persons and 195 were from unemployed persons.
</P>
<P>
   (You'll note that having a job doesn't prevent someone from
looking for another. In fact, that's the optimum way to search.)
</P>
<P>
   Among the 195 unemployed respondents, nearly two-thirds were
college graduates. Ninety-nine had a bachelor's degree; 25 others
had degrees beyond that. Only 19 of the unemployed respondents said
a high school diploma was their highest education milestone.
</P>
<P>
   You can argue that the survey isn't statistical proof of
anything, and you'd be right. But I talked to a parade of
well-educated job seekers _ fairly evenly distributed among people
in their 20s, 30s and 40s, with a slightly smaller representation
of 50-somethings _ who spoke of a disconnection between the jobs
being offered and the jobs they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   They sought positions commensurate with their education,
experience and salary expectations. They found companies looking
for entry-level workers.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the more senior-level job hunters said they felt as if
they were forcing booth attendants to take their resumes. (That
perception, of course, raised fears of age discrimination.)
</P>
<P>
   Some of the unemployed spoke of failed promises. They did what
they thought they were supposed to do to get ahead. They lost their
jobs anyway.
</P>
<P>
   They asked: Was the time and expense of their post-secondary
effort worth it? The degrees didn't help them keep their jobs.
Degrees don't seem to be helping them get new ones.
</P>
<P>
   It's a painful question, especially when record-low unemployment
numbers say anyone who wants a job can get one. ``A job,'' of
course, isn't the same as ``the job I want.''
</P>
<P>
   To be clear: I wish everyone could go to college. Longer dips in
the well of knowledge benefit the individual, the workplace and
society at large. But college isn't a financial or intellectual
reality for many.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the surveys from both unemployed and employed job seekers,
of all age groups and all education levels, said they were hunting
for positions that provided more challenge, more career development
opportunities, better workplace cultures and _ yes _ more money.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of companies may have dumbsized themselves. Let's hope the
quality of jobs available doesn't eventually dumbsize the quality
of the work force as well.

`COMEBACK KID' RETURNS TO NEW HAMPSHIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ President Clinton blended nostalgia, politics
and policy Thursday in an effort to rekindle his post-impeachment
presidency in the state where the ``Comeback Kid'' staged a
stunning political recovery in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who chose rain-swept New Hampshire for his first
domestic foray since the Senate cleared him of two impeachment
charges on Feb. 12, repeatedly referred to the 1992 Democratic
primary that rescued his plummeting presidential campaign following
allegations that he had had an extramarital affair and dodged the
draft during in the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used a round-table discussion in Dover to underscore his
health care policies and proposal to use projected budget surpluses
to keep Social Security solvent.
</P>
<P>
   He held a nostalgic lunch with long-time campaign supporters at
the Country Gourmet Restaurant in Merrimack and later helped raise
$100,000 for New Hampshire Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Aides insisted that it was merely ``coincidental'' that the
president had returned to New Hampshire on the seventh anniversary
of a legendary political recovery fueled by voters who set aside
questions about Clinton's character to support the Arkansas
governor's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Clinton appealed for support for proposals to enact
a $1,000 tax break for family members providing long-term care to
relatives; changes to enable the disabled to receive full federal
health benefits even if they work; and efforts to help small
businesses provide health insurance for employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would very much like to see the spirit in the country and in
Washington, D.C., that I felt here in New Hampshire so many years
ago when I first came here _ to take these health care issues and
sort of put them beyond partisan politics and put the people and
the families of this country and their interests first,'' Clinton
told the city hall gathering in Dover.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all get sick; we all need doctors; we all need health care
_ this should not be a partisan issue,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   White House adviser Paul Begala, who campaigned with Clinton
here in 1992, called the president's day-long visit ``a sentimental
journey'' that would be ``good for his soul'' in the wake of the
13-month sex-and-cover-up scandal at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has a deep and abiding affection for this state,
as he should,'' Begala said. ``They've been awfully good for him.
They took a chance on him, and I think he's repaid that trust with
his performance in office.''
</P>
<P>
   State Democratic Party Chairman Jeff Woodburn said Clinton's
whirlwind visit was ``like a class reunion,'' adding: ``People have
a strong feeling that this is where it all began.''
</P>
<P>
   The visit is part of a tightly scripted White House effort to
rebuild Clinton's political strength with the Republican-led
Congress in the aftermath of the impeachment struggle over his
dalliance with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton returns to the White House for a Friday meeting with
French President Jacques Chirac. He hosts a summit with the
bipartisan congressional leadership early next week before leaving
for campaign-style stops in California and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The president opened the week with a summit in Mexico with
President Ernesto Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's fledgling presidential campaign was in meltdown in the
weeks before New Hampshire's Feb. 18 primary in 1992, buffeted by a
firestorm of allegations that raised questions about his character.
</P>
<P>
   Former Arkansas nightclub singer Gennifer Flowers had claimed a
12-year sexual affair with the then-governor of Arkansas. Reports
surfaced that Clinton had written a letter to an Army colonel in
1969 thanking the officer for ``saving me from the draft'' by
enlisting Clinton in a Reserve Officers Training Corps program at
the University of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations decimated Clinton's initial lead over his chief
rival, former Massachusetts Sen. Paul Tsongas. Clinton's own polls
showed him trailing Tsongas by 20 percentage points in the darkest
moment of his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton fought back, proclaiming in one of the most storied
lines of his uphill campaign that if New Hampshire gave him a
``second chance, I'll be there with you until the last dog dies.''
</P>
<P>
   Initial primary returns showed Clinton edging ahead of Sens.
Robert Kerrey of Nebraska and Tom Harkin of Iowa to come in second
behind Tsongas.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, a media-savvy career politician, rushed before
television cameras minutes before the 11 p.m. newscasts to proclaim
his political recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Hampshire tonight has made Bill Clinton `The Comeback
Kid,''' he declared. ``This has been a tough campaign but at least
I've proved one thing _ I can take a punch.''
</P>
<P>
   Tsongas carried 34 percent of the vote; Clinton 26 percent;
Kerrey 12 percent; and Harkin 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had denied the affair with Flowers in a persuasive
pre-primary interview on the CBS ``60 Minutes'' program in January
1992. He later admitted to having had sexual intercourse with
Flowers during their extramarital affair.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reactions to the president on Thursday showed the variety of
sentiments that he continues to inspire in the Granite State. A
woman braved the rain to hold aloft a plastic-covered placard near
the former Pease Air Force Base that said: ``Clinton/Gore _ `92,
`96, `99 _ With You.''
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire Republican Chairman Steve Duprey struck a
conciliatory tone in a column for the Concord Monitor. Impeachment
is ``in the past and it is time to move forward,'' Duprey said,
adding that it is time for ``all of us to work together to
accomplish as much as possible in the remaining days of his
presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   There were critics as well. A cluster of protesters gathered
beyond earshot at the city hall in Dover, holding signs that said:
``Shame'' and ``Jail to the Chief.''
</P>
<P>
   The Manchester Union Leader welcomed Clinton with a front-page
editorial beneath the banner headline: ``Mr. President, you're a
disgrace!''
</P>
<P>
   Publisher Nackey Loeb wrote that it used to be ``something
special'' for a president to visit the state, but: ``Not anymore.
Not today. Not with this man.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Want to form a closer bond with your car? You could
talk to it _ and before long, you may find it is listening.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguar S-Type sedan, a 2000 model due to arrive in dealer
showrooms in May, will use speech recognition technology more
extensively than any car yet. With simple spoken commands, the
S-Type driver will be able to make calls on the cellular telephone,
change the radio station, play a compact disk or a cassette tape
and adjust the heating and air-conditioning. The Jaguar system
allows 44 commands in all.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say this is only the beginning. After years of
unfulfilled promises, speech recognition, which converts sounds
into numeric equivalents that are matched against a memory bank of
numbers that correspond to words, is catching on in the auto
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Already, it is becoming more widely used in telecommunications,
package shipping, stock trading and other businesses. Technological
breakthroughs with microprocessors and speech-recognition software
have vastly improved the performance of the systems and drastically
reduced their costs, making them more feasible in an industry where
every nickel counts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguar system is optional on S-Types in Britain, costing
buyers about $700 extra. The option has not yet been priced for the
American market; the S-Type is expected to sell here in the $40,000
range.
</P>
<P>
   For the United States, the system will be programmed to
understand American accents; buyers also will be able to add
commands in their own speech, an aid for those with thick or
unusual accents.
</P>
<P>
   Jaguar is not alone in its use of speech recognition, and all
the leading vehicle manufacturers are exploring uses for the
technology. Lexus, the luxury car division of Toyota, has offered
speech recognition with the cellular telephone in its flagship LS
400 sedan since 1993. The next generation of that $50,000 car is
likely to have more speech-recognition functions.
</P>
<P>
   The Onstar communications and navigation system, offered on some
models from the General Motors Corp., includes a hands-free phone
that dials numbers on command _ as, for instance, when told to
``Phone home'' or ``Dial 888-234-5678.''
</P>
<P>
   The all-new Mercedes-Benz S-Class for 2000, which comes out in
the spring, has a voice-activated cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
   A number of recent concept cars, which are showcases for
manufacturers' design and technical prowess, have shown how far
speech-recognition technology can be expanded. The Jaguar system
was developed by the Ford Motor Co.'s giant parts-making affiliate,
Visteon Corp. A year ago at the Society of Automotive Engineers
exposition in Detroit, Visteon demonstrated a speech-recognition
system that could read e-mail or stock quotes at a driver's
request.
</P>
<P>
   GM's equivalent parts operation, Delphi Automotive Systems, has
developed a Network Vehicle concept car that also calls up e-mail
or stock quotes. It further uses speech recognition to operate a
DirecTV satellite receiver and cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
   The audio and climate controls of the Buick Cielo, a concept car
shown last month at the North American International Auto Show in
Detroit, also respond to spoken commands, but the Cielo can do even
more: Tell its doors to open, and they do. Ask its roof to retract,
and the sun shines in.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler plans to add speech recognition to another
concept vehicle that made its debut at the Detroit show, the Jeep
Commander. If spoken to, its detachable computer, which has
Internet access, will read and write e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   Speech recognition is particularly attractive to auto makers
because of safety concerns over drivers' use of cellular phones and
navigation systems. Engineers are looking for technologies that can
allow drivers to continue using phones and electronic navigation
aids without taking their hands off the wheel and their eyes off
the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the person in the car is busy doing things other than
driving, safety becomes paramount,'' said Jeff Owens, general
director of engineering for Delphi Delco Electronics Systems in
Kokomo, Ind. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition, car buyers are demanding more comfort, convenience
and communications functions in their vehicles as they use them as
mobile offices. Experts predict that in the not-too-distant future,
cars will be equipped with Internet access to allow drivers to send
and retrieve e-mail, hear live traffic reports or pick up stock
quotes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amount of information flowing into the car is demanding we
find safer and more user-friendly ways to take the physical
manipulation out of the equation,'' Owens said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Speech recognition has the advantage of allowing simple voice
commands to replace multiple functions, said Bob Prew, principal
engineer and project coordinator for the S-Type. To replicate a
command like ``Play CD, disk 4, track 7,'' would take five or six
pushes of buttons or turns of knobs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the extra knobs, buttons and levers needed to
handle all of a car's new functions are competing for a limited
amount of valuable real estate in the interior. Speech recognition
can help to clean up cluttered dashboards and give designers more
freedom. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can tuck some of the systems away you have more design
freedom,'' said Bharat Patel, principal engineer for driver
information systems at Jaguar Cars in Coventry, England. ``You
don't have to make the telephone accessible, for instance.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Automotive experts predict that speech-recognition in cars _ and
with computers generally _ will eventually move beyond simple voice
commands like ``phone home'' and allow continuous speech. But that
could take years. Continuous speech recognition is especially
challenging in a car; the automotive environment tends to be far
more noisy than an office or a home.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, auto manufacturers are global and sell in diverse
markets. Creating systems that can understand all languages,
dialects and accents will be daunting.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, autos that listen to their owners will be more
acceptable than cars that talk back. In the 1980s, some Chrysler
models used synthesized voices to convey information to the
occupants _ that a door was ajar, for instance, or that a passenger
needed to buckle up. Drivers tired of the nagging they got when
they failed to refill the windshield washer fluid, and most of the
talking cars were stifled.

 &HT;    Basketball melodrama finds a higher calling
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sunday's ``Passing Glory'' on TNT is Black History
Month's ``Hoosiers,'' an untold sports melodrama that luxuriates
both in the sports and the melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   It's a basketball-as-life movie, an inspired-by-a-true-story
period piece that makes the first game between New Orleans' two
best high schools in 1965 _ all-black St. Augustine and all-white
Jesuit _ an embodiment of the era's segregation.
</P>
<P>
   Filmed last fall around Atlanta, ``Passing Glory'' displays a
glossy pedigree. Magic Johnson and Quincy Jones are executive
producers. Steve James (``Hoop Dreams'') directs. And the cast
features Emmy-winning Andre Braugher (``Homicide: Life on the
Street'') and Rip Torn (most memorable recently in ``The Larry
Sanders Show'').
</P>
<P>
   Braugher is Father Joseph Verrett, a proud activist and black
priest who arrives at St. Augustine after a protest he led in
Baltimore nearly got him thrown out of the priesthood. His
professional savior is Father Robert Grant (Torn), a white
father-figure priest who wants to do the right thing _ he just
doesn't want to do it so fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Passing Glory'' is at its best, as it is early on, when it
deftly mines the era's black experience from the inside out. It's
knowing enough to know just how many shades of gray that experience
includes, a range that stretches from fear to fearlessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some . . . just don't know when to quit,'' a black taxi
driver, using a racially charged word while listening to a radio
news account of black protesters being beaten by cops, tells Father
Verrett when he arrives.
</P>
<P>
   When Verrett acts surprised by the remark, the cabby asks
suspiciously, ``You from up North?''
</P>
<P>
   It is into this confused mix of anger and acquiescence that
Verrett finds himself. Basketball just becomes that mix's most
visible outlet. When St. Augustine's white coach leaves, Verrett
takes over. He's so unknowledgeable about the game that the first
order he barks is for his team to play a ``2-1-3 zone'' _ until a
player informs him only five of them can play at a time.
</P>
<P>
   But zones, picks and presses aren't really what basketball is
about here; Verrett is aiming for a target higher than a 10-foot
goal. It's through the game that his players discover their
resentments of second-class citizenship (all-white Jesuit has
facilities that shame their own), and their courage to do something
about it. When St. Augustine challenges Jesuit to a postseason
scrimmage for an unofficial championship, players on both sides
find themselves rising above the racial politics that surround
them, and presumably they help to change them.
</P>
<P>
   That final game, you might imagine, is its own back-and-forth,
slo mo-filled mini-melodrama. Like a few too many scenes in the
movie, it goes overboard when it hardly needs to. It's when
``Passing Glory'' leads with its head, and not its message, tha

 &HT;    MICROSOFT TRIAL ERUPTS IN RANCOR
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Microsoft antitrust trial exploded Thursday
into verbal fireworks as the trial judge directly questioned the
veracity of an outside witness who agreed to testify in Microsoft's
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The terms of your agreement with Microsoft make no sense to
me, if this was a genuine agreement,'' U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson told John Rose, a senior vice president of Compaq
Computer Corp., before sealing the courtroom to hear further
sensitive pricing testimony behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   As Microsoft's eighth defense witness, Rose contended that the
computer maker had yanked the Netscape browser from its
pre-installed systems to comply with Microsoft's bootup sequence
for Windows, which demanded that its Internet Explorer browser be
installed instead.
</P>
<P>
   But the government contends that Compaq acted in mid-1966 _
nearly a year after the purported deal was set in a conference call
with the software giant, after Microsoft threatened to cancel
Compaq's Windows licenses, which could have been ruinous to the
Houston-based firm.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 98 percent of the 10 million personal computers that
Compaq shipped to customers last year were powered by Windows. As
the Justice Department sees it, that's evidence enough that
Microsoft is a monopoly and must abide by a special set of rules
that bar the software company from muscling computer makers.
</P>
<P>
   David Boies, the government's lead counsel, introduced Compaq
documents that cited the two companies as ``being joined at the
hip.'' And he read an internal memo by Microsoft co-founder Bill
Gates, which Gates wrote after a visit to Compaq's Houston base, in
which he said he had personally ``thanked Rose for all his trips to
Seattle and for extracting the time (to prepare) for the lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I never heard him say that,'' Rose told Boies. ``That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose said his two day-long trips in 1998 to Microsoft's Redmond,
Wash., headquarters, which is near Seattle, were to deal with
Windows NT servers and had nothing to do with the trial. In fact,
Rose went on, ``I've never spoken to anyone at Microsoft, or to
their counsel, about this lawsuit, other than when (Microsoft
executive Paul) Maritz asked me to testify.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, Boies caused a furor in the packed courtroom when
he suggested that Compaq had tipped Microsoft off to a competitor's
software development program, thereby breaking a near-sacred code
in the industry known as a non-disclosure agreement, NDA.
</P>
<P>
   At that, Rose's lawyer, William Coston, jumped up from his
wooden bench at the rear of the courtroom and approached the judge
while glaring at Boies. ``We don't violate NDAs,'' Coston said,
accusing Boies of ``sullying the firm's reputation by this
allegation.''
</P>
<P>
   After the outburst, Jackson called a brief recess to allow Boies
to give Coston the name of his source at Compaq. But when the trial
resumed, Coston flayed into Boies anew, calling what he had done
``a cheap trial stunt.'' Taken aback, Boies named his Compaq source
in open court, prompting the judge to shut off a line of
questioning for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Microsoft released written testimony from Microsoft
executive Eric Engstrom. When Engstrom takes the stand next week,
he will become the second witness in a row to refute government
allegations that Microsoft met with another company and offered to
divide the market.
</P>
<P>
   Engstrom, general manager of Microsoft's multimedia efforts,
contradicted testimony by Apple Computer Inc. executive Avie
Tevanian that Microsoft had disabled Apple's QuickTime technology.
He also denied Tevanian's claims that Microsoft wanted to carve up
the multimedia market between the two companies.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executive Dan Rosen, who will follow Rose to the
stand, called Netscape Communication Corp. Jim Barksdale a
revisionist for testifying that Microsoft offered to split the
browser market with its rival in the browser wars.

ISSUE OF BOND PRICES MOVES TO TOP OF JAPAN'S AGENDA 
</HEADLINE>
 (rk) 
 By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Japanese bonds were probably the last thing on the mind
of Keizo Obuchi, a mild-mannered old-style leader, when he became
prime minister six months ago, but in recent days his aides have
been checking the blips and ticks in the bond market.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of parliament are even receiving daily bond sheets,
highlighting the day's closing prices of the benchmark 10-year
bond. Mom-and-pop shops in the rural areas are watching bond
prices. And over the last couple of weeks, one of the most vocal
commentators on bond yields has been the brash and sharp-witted
Hiromu Nonaka, Japan's top government spokesman and Obuchi's
right-hand man.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians like Nonaka have pushed the issue of bonds to the
forefront of the public agenda because the turmoil in the bond
market, along with a strong yen, can extend Japan's economic
recession, which in turn threatens global economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   National bonds have become the center of a policy debate between
politicians and economic policy-makers over how to pull Japan out
of a deflationary spiral and its prolonged recession, the worst
since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials, dissatisfied with the effectiveness of
conventional solutions, are advocating more radical measures,
including adding to the money supply without worrying about higher
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi has told voters his government will revive the economy
over the next 12 months or so. Though his popularity ratings have
risen as he has consolidated his political base, a protracted
recession could seriously damage his political future.
</P>
<P>
   This country has become fixated on the bond market because
prices have fallen as investors have dumped long-term bonds,
forcing their yields to rise. They are worried that a huge volume
of fresh bonds issued to pay for construction and other public
works projects to stimulate the economy will push bond prices
lower. Higher yields mean higher interest rates, which can
extinguish any incipient recovery.
</P>
<P>
   So in the last couple of weeks, politicians have bullied even
the Bank of Japan, the nation's conservative central bank, which
cut its overnight interest rate on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Now that rate is headed toward zero, and Thursday it hit
six-hundredths of a percent, which meant that banks were borrowing
money overnight at virtually no cost.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, politicians are not satisfied, mainly because the
central bank is focusing only on lowering the short-term rates, not
the long-term ones, where the rise is the greater economic threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``To combat the monster of deflationary spiral, the Bank of
Japan is using the two-sword style of fencing,'' said Yoshimi
Watanabe, a prominent parliament member for the Liberal Democratic
Party, who worries that an overall decline of wages and prices of
goods, from property to stocks, could worsen by the summer if
economic policy-makers do not take more drastic steps. ``To fight
against the monster, the Bank of Japan has further shortened the
short sword, which is the short-term interest rate. But that is not
an effective weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   Watanabe and others would like to see the Bank of Japan ease
monetary policy by buying bonds to add to the money supply rather
than just manipulating interest rates, which are easier to focus on
but are already so low that reducing them more hardly makes a
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the money supply could potentially increase inflation
by circulating more yen in relation to the goods and services
available for purchase. But some economists argue that some
inflation might encourage consumers to spend more to avoid rising
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Creating a fresh supply of yen would also push down the value of
the currency, an idea that is gaining more acceptance because a
weaker yen helps by making exports more competitive abroad. Eisuke
Sakakibara, the vice finance minister nicknamed ``Mr. Yen'' for his
influence on the currency, has reversed his position and said he
would tolerate a weaker currency.
</P>
<P>
   The yen traded Thursday at 118 yen to the dollar in Tokyo and
hit 120 yen in early trading in New York, down from 114 yen a week
ago. Likewise, long-term bond yields ended Thursday at 1.875
percent, the lowest in nearly three weeks.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In the last four months, as bond prices have fallen, the yields
on long-term Japanese bonds have tripled, to 2.4 percent earlier
this month. That seems low compared with rates in the United
States, but they are nonetheless getting high enough here to choke
off a recovery.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said that the
government would resume buying some Japanese bonds on the market
until the end of March, and that has slightly cheered investors. In
December, Miyazawa said the ministry, the largest single buyer in
the market, would curb such purchases, and his remarks led
investors to dump bonds, sending the yields soaring.
</P>
<P>
   Still, politicians are cautious that the effects of these most
recent measures, particularly by the Bank of Japan, may be
short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bank of Japan failed to send a message that they are
seriously concerned about the situation,'' said Yasuhisa Shiozaki,
a member of parliament for the Liberal Democratic Party and a
former Bank of Japan official. ``They could have insinuated they
are going to do something different. Difference is the biggest
message they must send to the world.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Nonaka said he was carefully watching how the Bank
of Japan's rate cut stimulated economic activity and how the
resumption of bond buying by the government brought investors back
to the bond market. There is still a possibility, he said, that
more pressure will be put on the Bank of Japan to take further
drastic steps to bring down long-term rates.
</P>
<P>
   Shiozaki and other politicians say that policy-makers need to
retool industry and address the unwieldy structural problems in the
economy, such as excess investment, too many workers and too much
capacity at factories. Those problems will not necessarily go away
because the government spends money on large public works projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we really adding enough to the fundamentals of the
Japanese economy? We're not,'' Shiozaki said. ``People are always
saying they fear the deflationary spiral. But you cannot just stop
it by doing a quick fix. You've got to understand what is the real
cause of the deflation.''

CELEB APPEAL ... IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH! 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD ROEPER  
 c.1999 The Chicago Sun-Times  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   We keep lowering the minimum qualifications for becoming a
temporary celebrity in our culture.
</P>
<P>
   I can remember the good old days, when you had to mutilate your
husband with a butcher knife, or have an affair with a teen-ager
who ends up shooting your wife, or get arrested for servicing a
famous actor, before you'd get the People magazine stories and the
``Inside Edition'' coverage and the monologue mentions from Jay
Leno and David Letterman.
</P>
<P>
   Now look how easy it is. One minute, Athena Rolando is getting
hit with a restraining order after breaking into Brad Pitt's house
and trying on his clothes; the next, she's giving interviews on
tabloid TV programs. There are even nude photos of her posted on
the Internet, I kid you not.
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm. Stalking a hunky actor should not put one in position to
challenge Cindy Margolis for the title of ``most downloaded woman
on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the curious case of Carol Phony-Braun. Not the
former senator from the great state of Illinois, but the wacky
21-year-old Chicagoan who used to be known as Lauryn Valentine, but
changed her name to Carol Moseley-Braun as some sort of twisted
tribute.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid confusion, we will refer to Carol Moseley-Braun No. 2
as CMB2 from this point forward.
</P>
<P>
   What a little celebrity CMB2 has become in the few weeks since
we first heard about her playing the name game. Tons of attention
in the local press, write-ups in magazines, mentions on national
programs such as ``Today.'' She may have had more face time than
the real Carol for a while there.
</P>
<P>
   First, CMB2 claimed she had no political ambitions. She went to
court, she said, only to change her name as a way of expressing
gratitude and admiration because Braun had chatted with her briefly
in Washington several years ago and had encouraged her not to drop
out of high school.
</P>
<P>
   But a short while later, CMB2 announced her intentions to run
against Ald. Percy Giles in Chicago's hotly contested 37th ward.
Ballots in Chicago have featured convicted felons, and slicksters
who have used their mother's maiden name in order to sound more
Irish or Polish or whatever would work to their advantage, but this
was new. A total name change! It's a wonder some guy didn't rename
himself John F. Kennedy Jr. years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Thing is, the ploy to dupe the general public was somewhat
effective despite all the publicity. We news junkies forget that
people sometimes hear only partial reports, or second-hand versions
of a story. A few weeks ago, before CMB2's name was thrown off the
ballot, a well-informed, highly educated person said to me, ``Can
you believe Carol Moseley-Braun is running for alderman? I hope she
loses again.''
</P>
<P>
   When I explained it wasn't that Carol Moseley-Braun, he replied,
``Well, I hope this Carol Moseley-Braun loses, too!''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, CMB2 was at the Chicago Board of Election
Commissioners to file as a write-in candidate. Sigh.
</P>
<P>
   I talked to Ernest Henton, who is the ``spokesman and campaign
manager'' for the CMB2 juggernaut. The first thing I had to find
out was how one becomes the spokesman and manager for such an
individual. What were his qualifications?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, for the last 10 years I've been a licensed practical
nurse,'' Henton told me.
</P>
<P>
   Oh. That explains it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've always done grassroots political work,'' Henton said.
</P>
<P>
   And how did he hook up with CMB2?
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms. Moseley-Braun is a family friend. When she made that trip
to Washington (and met with the real deal), she was with my sister.
She even lived with our family for a time. When all this started
breaking and the media got involved, she asked me if I'd write a
speech or give a speech, help her like that. That's how it all
started for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The funny thing is _ well, there are a lot of funny things here.
What I meant to say was, Henton has the spokesman thing down pat.
Like when CMB2 was disqualified from the ballot, he said, ``This is
a total miscarriage of justice. How can one say that it's false and
misleading to use your name?''
</P>
<P>
   Not bad, eh?
</P>
<P>
   As for Tuesday's filing, Henton was quite pleased, ticking off
the call letters of more than a half dozen TV and radio outlets in
attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a wonderful reception,'' he said. ``It was good for
her.''
</P>
<P>
   True. Legitimate aldermanic candidates would sell their pets for
this much attention.
</P>
<P>
   (Henton promised me CMB2 would give me an interview for this
column, but weirdly enough, she ducked my efforts to contact her.
What kind of way is that to run a campaign?)
</P>
<P>
   We're suckers for this story, all of us. It has great chuckle
potential, and it's another example of how no city can match
Chicago for colorful elections.
</P>
<P>
   A question, though, for CMB2: If you wanted to associate with a
winner, shouldn't you have changed your name to Peter Fitzgerald,
the guy who booted Braun's butt in the last election?
</P>

   BBA-YANKS-CLEMENS (Tampa, Fla.) _ In a startling trade, the New
York Yankees acquired Roger Clemens, a five-time winner of the Cy
Young award, in exchange for David Wells, a colorful and very
valuable member of the 1998 championship team. In obtaining
Clemens, the Yankees now have one of the best pitchers of the 20th
century on their roster and conceivably could be even more
dominating in 1999 than they were in 1998. But in losing Wells, the
Yankees will now be without a pitcher who had one of the best
postseason records in baseball history. By Buster Olney.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Kevin Lee wanted to be an accountant. But that was
before Lee, a 22-year-old student at New York University, worked
one summer at a New Jersey accounting firm. ``Accounting is
stable,'' he said, ``but it's not exciting because you're doing the
same thing over and over.'' And he says he can make much more
working on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of young people are reaching such conclusions these days.
A result is a worsening shortage of accountants, even as the demand
for qualified accountants rises amid a boom in small risk-taking
companies whose books cry out for careful scrutiny. That has raised
concerns about a corresponding decline in the quality of auditors
as the profession reaches deeper to fill its ranks.
</P>
<P>
   From Georgetown University to the University of Colorado, the
number of students graduating with an accounting degree this spring
will be only about half what it was a few years ago. Accounting
professors fret about classrooms that seem empty. The largest
accounting firms, in the midst of their busy season, are
aggressively recruiting liberal arts majors, science majors, any
student with an inkling of becoming an accountant.
</P>
<P>
   As accountants debate what to do, the profession's largest and
most powerful group has proposed making the job more attractive by,
in part, reducing the requirements. The group is lobbying state
legislatures to eliminate the two years of on-the-job experience
that most accountants now need at a public accounting firm to earn
the right to put the letters CPA _ for certified public accountant
_ behind their name.
</P>
<P>
   But some accountants, regulators and investors adamantly oppose
the plan, saying it makes about as much sense as lowering the
standards for emergency-room nurses or police officers if shortages
developed in those jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not in the public's best interest,'' wrote members of
the National Conference of CPA Practitioners, a group that
represents about 1,000 small accounting firms, in a letter to the
much-larger American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the
group that is pushing to relax the standards.
</P>
<P>
   But almost everyone agrees that something must be done quickly.
Even before the recent steep declines on many campuses, the number
of people sitting for the CPA exam had declined by 15 percent
between 1990 and 1997. And even as the number of public companies
in the United States has grown by more than 20 percent in the last
10 years, the number of professionals in public accounting has
remained almost unchanged at roughly 131,000.
</P>
<P>
   While some may not see the urgency of finding more people
wanting to do what many like to refer to as counting beans, public
accountants play a key role: acting as watchdogs for the millions
of Americans who are investors. Ever since the Depression, every
public company has been required by law to hire outside auditors to
review its financial reports and give an independent, expert
opinion on whether the numbers reported by corporate executives are
true.
</P>
<P>
   Many financial experts say that, given the freewheeling finances
of so many of America's newest companies in industries like high
technology, there has never been a greater need for sharp, tough
auditors.
</P>
<P>
   John C. Bogle, the founder of the Vanguard Group, the giant
mutual fund company, said it ``would be very troublesome'' to relax
the standards for public accountants. ``It is full disclosure and
accurate financial statements,'' he said, ``that are the basis for
our capital market system.''
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, the laws of supply and demand would take care of any
shortage, by raising accountants' salaries to make the profession
more enticing. And certainly, accountants would like little more
than being able to charge more for their services. But they find
corporate clients reluctant to pay much for their annual audits,
even if that stinginess means running a higher risk of later being
sued by shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Because the large accounting firms cannot pay as much as
investment banks, which also hire bright students with accounting
degrees, more accounting majors like Kevin Lee are choosing a Wall
Street career instead.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At Lee's school, Paul R. Brown, chairman of New York
University's accounting department, said that while the accounting
rolls are down only slightly, more accounting majors are showing
little interest in actually becoming licensed as CPAs.
</P>
<P>
   Other students are changing their majors from accounting to
information technology, intending to become consultants, a job they
view as more glamorous and possibly more lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Colorado in Colorado Springs, Professor
Paul B.W. Miller has only 13 students in his intermediate
accounting course this semester, down from 23 last year.
</P>
<P>
   And, at McDonough School of Business at Georgetown University,
Scott Whisenant, an accounting professor, said 50 percent fewer
students are expected to graduate with degrees in accounting this
spring than in 1996. ``We're seeing the really bright students
deciding not to become auditors,'' Whisenant said. ``What does this
mean when it comes to the quality of future auditors?''
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 results of the CPA test, which all accountants must
pass as lawyers must pass the bar exam, provide some evidence that
Whisenant's observation may be true. In November 1997, according to
the National Association of State Boards of Accountancy, which
represents the licensing bodies in each state, only 12.5 percent of
the candidates taking the test for the first time passed all four
parts _ the lowest percentage since 1985, the year the association
began keeping track.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission say they
already see signs that auditors' work may be slipping. Indeed, the
accounting firms that audited companies like Cendant Corp., Waste
Management and Livent Inc. have recently been sued after some
numbers in the financial statements proved to be wishful thinking.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL GRAF FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   The commission has formed an expert panel to study why auditors
failed to detect some of the recent high-profile financial frauds.
Regulators say they worry that some auditors may lack the
experience needed to spot problems at companies with complex
operations. The regulators have told the big accounting firms that
``it is essential'' for experienced partners to spend more time on
complicated audits rather than leaving most of the work to auditors
fresh out of school.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL GRAF)
</P>
<P>
   Lynn E. Turner, the commission's chief accountant, said this
week that the proposal to reduce the on-the-job experience
requirement for auditors might only make matters worse. ``The
classroom is a great primer,'' Turner said, ``but it sure doesn't
get you there.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders at the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants, the national organization that administers the test
aspiring accountants must take to be certified, say they do not
believe their efforts to relax the experience requirements will
hurt auditors' competence. Instead, they say, the changes are
needed to attract talented people back to the profession.
</P>
<P>
   Because fewer accountants are choosing to work as auditors at
public accounting accounting firms, institute officials say that
accountants should no longer be required to work at a public
accounting firm for two years as an outside auditor to be licensed
as a CPA. They are asking state legislatures to change laws to
require only one year of experience, which could be obtained by
working for any licensed accountant, even one who works only as a
personal financial planner.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL GRAFS FOLLOW)
</P>
<P>
   Barry C. Melancon, the institute's president, said the new
experience requirements would include measures aimed at maintaining
high quality audits. For example, accountants supervising an audit,
he said, would be required to have much more experience than other
accountants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quality of auditors is going to improve in this
environment,'' Melancon said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL GRAFS)
</P>
<P>
   The institute has flexed its political muscles before to get the
majority of states to pass its proposals. For example, in recent
years, the institute has asked the states to pass a proposal that
would require CPAs to have 150 hours of college credit, up from 120
hours. Almost every state has now passed that measure.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, the institute has worked to gain new members
and make the profession more attractive by pushing accountants into
new fields like financial planning. After the institute's lobbying
efforts, more state legislatures have recently passed laws that
allow CPAs to earn commissions by selling such things as stocks and
computer software.
</P>
<P>
   The institute's leaders have even suggested stripping the words
``public accountant'' from the once-coveted CPA title so that it
stands instead for ``certified professional adviser,'' signaling
that the career is about more than just numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the institute has raised concerns among some of its
members by proposing changes to the exhausting two-day
15-and-a-half-hour exam that is used to weed out those that lack
the knowledge, skills or stamina to be an accountant.
</P>
<P>
   The test would be shortened so that accountants would have to
pass only two sections rather than the four sections now required.
</P>
<P>
   The pencil-and-paper exam would be changed so that candidates
would be tested on a computer. The exam would be interactive, so
that if candidates score well early in the test, they would have
fewer questions to answer.
</P>
<P>
   (ALL REMAINING GRAFS OPTIONAL)
</P>
<P>
   Arleen R. Thomas, the institute's vice president for
professional standards, said the exam would still cover the same
material. ``We don't want to change the difficulty of the CPA
test,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas, Paul Allen, the chairman of the state's board of
accountancy, which licenses CPAs in the state, said board members
were concerned about the institute's proposal to reduce the work
experience needed to be a CPA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only by real-life experience in public accounting,''
Allen said, ``that you can gain the skills and the objectivity that
we believe are key qualities of our profession.''
</P>
<P>
   Labor experts say other professions have tinkered with their
qualifying standards when there were either too few or too many
applicants. Peter Capelli, a management professor at the Wharton
School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, said the
number of flight hours needed by airline pilots had been raised and
lowered over the years depending on the number of pilots needed.
</P>
<P>
   And, in the early 1900s, Capelli said, the medical profession
raised its requirements when a glut of doctors appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Some accountants say they believe, if anything, that raising the
bar is the answer, even for the shortage in their profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toughening the standards increases the prestige and
attractiveness of a profession,'' said Howard Schilit, the founder
of the Center for Financial Research and Analysis in Rockville,
Md., which provides independent financial research to institutional
investors.

   SAN LUIS POTOSI, Mexico _ As Mario Quintero steps to the
microphone, strums his guitar and begins singing about the
pleasures of snorting cocaine after a few drinks, scores of
teen-age girls crowd the outdoor stage screaming, ``I love you,
Mario!''
</P>
<P>
   Quintero and his wildly popular band, the Tucanes de Tijuana, or
Toucans of Tijuana, follow with a song about a smuggler's love for
his rooster, parrot and goat, underworld symbols for marijuana,
cocaine and heroin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live off my three fine animals,'' Quintero sings to roars of
approval from thousands of cowboy-hatted fans packed into an
outdoor concert grounds here. His next ballad is ``Most Wanted
Men,'' in which he assumes the voice of a powerful trafficker who
boasts about bribing politicians and the police ``to control whole
countries.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tucanes are one of the most successful of hundreds of
Mexican country bands whose lyrics chronicle traffickers' daily
lives and violent routines. The extraordinary popularity of their
music here and in the United States underscores the profound roots
the drug industry has sunk into North American poular culture,
suggesting that millions of fans quietly admire the smugglers'
fabled wealth, anti-establishment bravura and bold entrepreneurial
skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drug trade has permeated our social fabric,'' said Manuel
Valenzuela, a professor at a research institute in Tijuana who
studies the drug ballads, known in Spanish as narco-corridos.
</P>
<P>
   ``The political elite, the army, the church and the banks have
all been corrupted, and in this context many young people see in
narcotics their route to early wealth, even if they fear dying
before they're 25. The corridos just reflect this evolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexican songwriters have been composing corridos for at least a
century, chronicling the heroic deeds of revolutionary generals and
border brigands. Marijuana and opium smugglers became the subjects
of choice in the 1970s, with the early corridos often concluding
with morality lessons about the evils of the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   But in the '90s, young musicians like the Tucanes have carried
the corridos toward overt celebration of the narcotics culture,
punctuating many recordings with machine-gun fire and police
sirens.
</P>
<P>
   Lidia Salazar, a marketing executive for EMI Music Mexico, said
the Tucanes sold 2.5 million CDs in 1997 and might have exceeded
that record last year had the government not barred corridos from
the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Radio stations all over Mexico have told us that the Interior
Ministry has forbidden them from playing the corridos,'' Ms.
Salazar said.
</P>
<P>
   A senior government official said there was no formal ban. But
the official acknowledged that Interior Minister Francisco
Labastida Ochoa had repeatedly met the owners of radio stations and
leaders of the National Chamber of the Radio and Television
Industry to condemn the corridos. Ochoa was expressing his view
``that making drug traffickers into heroes is damaging to Mexican
youth.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Quintero, 28, and his three fellow musicians were born in the
hills of Sinaloa, the state that is a major opium and marijuana
producer and is the birthplace of most major Mexican traffickers.
Like many other Sinaloans, they migrated to Tijuana as teen-agers,
working for a time in factories there before forming the Tucanes in
1987 to play for local dances and house parties.
</P>
<P>
   Their first hit was in 1992, ``Clave Privada,'' or ``Private
Pin.'' It chronicled the exploding use of beepers among drug
wholesalers and their street salesmen in Mexico and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Their notoriety spread in 1997, when a magazine, Proceso,
published the confession of an accused trafficker, Alejandro
Hodoyan, who in a lurid description of the Tijuana drug underworld
said Quintero had composed many corridos that documented killings
carried out by the Arellano Felix brothers, who are said to control
the drug trade in northwestern Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Quintero's corridos outline a code of behavior for traffickers,
Hodoyan said, adding:
</P>
<P>
   ``If you listen carefully, the songs tell how the Arellanos
killed these people. I don't know how he gets his information. But
through the corridos comes the philosophy, how the members of the
cartel have to behave. They tell you what they did wrong. Why they
were killed. You learn what you have to do so they won't kill
you.''
</P>
<P>
   In appreciation of the Tucanes' insightful work, the Arellanos
bought them uniforms, sound equipment and a touring bus, Hodoyan
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a preconcert interview in their bus in San Luis Potosi,
Quintero denied knowing the Arellanos. ``We worked for years
playing private parties in Tijuana,'' he said. ``We don't know
everyone who hired us, and we didn't ask to see their police
records.''
</P>
<P>
   Quintero, who writes all the Tucanes material, said he gleaned
his material from the daily press.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like news writing,'' he said, asserting that fans,
like newspaper readers, are fascinated by the details of the top
traffickers' lives. ``Just their names sell recordings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the concert tour, the Tucanes appear to be models of clean
living. They pump up before performances by guzzling fruit
milkshakes, and on stage they drink only bottled water.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be a good example to my children,'' said Clemente
Flores, the bass player.
</P>
<P>
   But they cultivate a violent image, pretending in their music
videos to be the gunslinging traffickers of their ballads. In one
popular video, Quintero and his accordion player kill several
police officers with automatic rifles. In another, they appear
alongside a man tied to a chair who is being tortured, apparently
by traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Other corrido singers have blurred the distinction between life
and art, with violent consequences. Chalino Sanchez, a corrido
singer from Los Angeles who liked to keep a pistol thrust in his
belt at performances, was killed by gunmen in Culiacan, Sinaloa,
after a concert in May 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The violent backdrop of the music has prompted academic debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``In seminars people stand up and say, `Corridos are terrible,
they glorify criminals,''' a professor in Mexico City, Jorge
Chabat, said. ``And they do, of course. But people like them, and
this is related to the Mexican psyche. People see traffickers as
men of humble origins who defy the power structure. That can be
attractive. Traffickers are a kind of self-made man, Mexican
style.''
</P>
<P>
   Another professor, Maria Herrera-Sobek, argued at a conference
at the University of California at Los Angeles last year that
corridos celebrate the same masculine virtues assigned to war
heroes in the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``They attribute to traffickers characteristics that indicate a
high degree of respect, including bravery, manliness, justice and
candor,'' Professor Herrera-Sobek said. ``Others that are not
necessarily tied to morality but are positive values within our
culture are cunning, strength, fame and ferocity.''
</P>
<P>
   At the San Luis Potosi concert grounds, Luis Gaspar Perez, 30,
the manager of a grocery store, stood watching the performance, his
breath hanging heavy in the chill night air as he explained his
devotion to the Tucanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tell the truth about our society,'' Gaspar said.

A ROMANTIC PUSHES MINIMALISM TO THE MAXIMUM  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada, Calif.)  By KEN JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ronald Bladen may have been one of the founding
fathers of Minimalism, as some have called him, but that depends on
what you mean by Minimalism.
</P>
<P>
   Bladen (1918-1988) started making simplified, industrial-looking
sculptures in the 1960s. But Minimalism in the most thoroughgoing
sense meant more than just extreme formal economy. At its most
radical, Minimalism tried to eliminate any dimension other than
that of the immediate, material present, forcing concentration on
the physical facts of the object and the space it occupied.
</P>
<P>
   But Bladen, who was born in Vancouver and spent his formative
years in San Francisco, where the Abstract Expressionist Clyfford
Still was the presiding spiritual force, was too much the romantic
poet to be a pure Minimalist. An interesting if not wholly
satisfying retrospective at P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center through
May 30 makes that clear.
</P>
<P>
   Covering five decades, the exhibition presents a curiously
diverse oeuvre. It moves from a set of Symbolist graphite drawings
from the 1940's, to some Abstract Expressionistic paintings from
the 1950s, to four of the giant-scale Minimalist works for which
Bladen is best known, to a selection of pedestal-size geometric
models from the 1970s and 80s. In all of this, the retrospective
conveys no sense of continuous formal evolution. But it does affirm
a spiritual continuity. However Minimalistic his mature sculpture
may appear, it is animated by the soul of an Abstract
Expressionist.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1940s drawings, Bladen appears to have been inspired by
idiosyncratic visionaries like William Blake or Albert Pinkham
Ryder. Murky and densely worked with erasers as well as graphite,
they depict barely decipherable symbolic images of things like an
angel, bursts of light and mystical signs.
</P>
<P>
   Of particular interest at this point is a small painting from
1939-40 depicting a single telephone pole starkly silhouetted
against a red sky to monumental and unmistakably religious effect.
It is a remarkable anticipation of the stark, black monuments of
the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Bladen continued to paint into the early 1960s, producing thick,
brushy, monochromatic or two-tone fields punctuated by a few
irregular shapes. The debt to Still is evident, but there is a
material generosity and compositional compactness that corrects for
the arid grandiosity of the older painter.
</P>
<P>
   Bladen's Abstract Expressionistic impulses come to fruition not
in painting but, paradoxically, in his huge geometrical sculptures
of the 1960s. The culmination of this show occurs in one large room
containing only the enormous ``Cathedral Evening'' (1969), in which
from two massive, trapezoidal feet a great V shape thrusts outward
and upward almost 30 feet into space. Positioned in the center of
the room, it points with phallic urgency toward an open, arched
doorway. The effect is not unlike that of a painting by Franz
Kline.
</P>
<P>
   What's impressive about this piece is not its material being. Up
close, it is a letdown. Roughly sheathed in thin plywood painted
dull black, it has none of the material sensuousness of the
sculptures of Donald Judd or Richard Serra. But it does have a
great theatrical command of space. Hovering mysteriously a couple
of inches off the ground, its cantilevered, cannonlike element
defying gravity, it seems otherworldly, an inexplicable thing from
another planet looming with enigmatic purpose over the viewer.
</P>
<P>
   That theatrical effect is felt in two other large works
displayed indoors, each in its own separate room. ``Three
Elements'' (1965) consists of three identical 10-foot-tall black
boxes jutting up from the floor at a slant. ``Curve'' (1969) is a
great U-shaped, two-foot-thick wall, white on the inside and black
on the outside. Crammed into smallish, rather dim rooms, these
works seem at once futuristic and primordial.
</P>
<P>
   The psychological impact is not simply a matter of size. Rather,
it is in the way the works fill the empty room, pushing against its
limits. It is instructive to compare the one large-scale work
placed outdoors: ``Rockers'' (1965), a construction of low rocker
forms from which a pair of vertical square pillars rise 20 feet, is
a big sculpture, but in P.S. 1's vast courtyard it has a toylike
quality, which is enhanced by its cheery, taxicab-yellow paint job.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to the 14 pedestal-scale models for sculptures from the
70s and 80s is disappointing. Made mostly of wood and painted
semigloss black, they monotonously recycle a generic vocabulary of
rectangular boxes, pyramids, trapezoids, V-shapes and
parallelograms; they lack the drama of the earlier big works. They
have an angular, rather busy dynamism that harks back to the airy
utopianism of early Russian modernists like Kasimir Malevich or El
Lissitzky.
</P>
<P>
   Titles affirm that Bladen continued to have spiritual aims in
mind: ``Cosmic Seed,'' ``Blake's Shadow,'' ``Host of the Ellipse.''
But the main impression is of a bland, corporate Modernism. Unlike
his early paintings and drawings, Bladen's mature sculpture doesn't
look very relevant today.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a funny echo of Bladen's theatrical play with scale
in an installation by Thom Merrick on view at P.S. 1, in a gallery
not far from Bladen's show. It consists simply of a giant, inflated
cartoon dinosaur lying on its side and filling the room with its
pneumatic green bulges.
</P>
<P>
   (It is actually one of those balloon signs used by car dealers
and other roadside businesses to attract customers.) Outdoors, this
object would be of little interest. Inside, its gigantism is
impressive. Pop-style irony aside, considered mainly as an
overwhelming of the container by the contained, ``Composition in
Green and White,'' as it is called, carries on where Bladen left
off.

   MOSCOW _ With time running out on a Saturday deadline for Serb
leaders to make peace with Kosovo rebels or face NATO airstrikes,
Russia's President Boris N. Yeltsin Thursday warned President
Clinton not to use force against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions rose as talks in France between Serbs and ethnic
Albanians inched forward and the United States sent additional
warplanes to Europe for strikes that Washington has warned would be
``swift and severe'' if a deal is not reached by Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana, asked at a news conference
in Macedonia how fast NATO would act if the talks failed, said,
``It would be very soon.'' Western embassies and aid workers in
Yugoslavia began preparing to remove staff in anticipation of
possible air raids. The American embassy personnel will arrive in
Budapest Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, Yeltsin responded to a question about the US decision
Wednesday to send an additional 51 planes to Europe with a blunt
admonition at a Kremlin summit with European Union leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I conveyed to Clinton my view, both in written form and by
telephone, that (airstrikes) will not work. And that's all -- my
whole answer. We will not let you touch Kosovo,'' Yeltsin boomed as
the European leaders looked on in stunned silence.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear how Yeltsin intends to back up his threat.
Later, European Union chairman Jacques Santer could only say he
thought Yeltsin was ``in good form.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's remarks caused consternation in Washington as well,
where White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton had not
spoken to Yeltsin in recent days. Lockhart said the United States
has worked closely with the Russians on Kosovo. But, he said, ``We
reserve the right to act in NATO's self-interest if that's
necessary. And we will if we don't get the conclusion we need to
get at the peace talks.''
</P>
<P>
   The talks between Serb leaders and ethic Albanian rebels in
Rambouillet, France, which Thursday stretched into their twelfth
day, are being mediated by the six-nation Contact Group, which
includes the United States, Russia, France, Britain, Germany and
Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The Contact Group has set a deadline of noon on Saturday, Paris
time, (6 a.m. EST) to reach a deal that would grant broad autonomy
to Kosovo, the impoverished southern province of Serbia whose
population is 90 percent ethnic Albanian. In return, separatist
rebels of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) would agree to stop
fighting and relinquish their weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the agreement would be the deployment in Kosovo of
some 30,000 NATO troops, including several thousand American
soldiers, to implement the deal. Belgrade has so far refused to
allow such a force on Yugoslav territory, and the rebels have
refused to disarm or give up their demand for independence.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 2,000 people have died and hundreds of thousands
have been driven from their homes in fighting between Serb forces
and KLA rebels over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow says it will support the peace plan if the Serbs,
Orthodox Christian Slavs like Russians, agree to the deployment of
NATO troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia, taking into account the answer of the Yugoslavian
authorities, will consider the possibility of taking part in such
an action,'' Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, in poor health and facing a growing challenge to his
authority from his prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov, may have been
trying to reassert himself with his bold statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is typical Yeltsin,'' said Andrei Piontkowksi of the
Moscow-based Center for Strategic Studies. ``He wants to remind
everyone that he is alive. But he is putting Russian diplomacy in a
difficult situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin has issued similar warnings in the past. He told the
United States not to bomb Iraq over standoffs between Baghdad and
United Nations weapons inspectors. The United States and Britain
bombed anyway, and Russia's only response was to withdraw briefly
its ambassadors from the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   The longterm relations between Russia and the United States may
have suffered deeper damage. Russia has already shelved
ratification of the 1993 Start-2 agreement that would limit
strategic nuclear weapons in the two countries. And a Russian
Defense Ministry official, Gen. Leonty Ivashov, said Thursday that
Moscow had no plans to discuss with Washington changes the United
States would like to see in the 1972 anti-ballistic missile (ABM)
treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a superpower acts like a drunken debauchee in a
kindergarten, it is not good. It will end badly,'' said Siberian
governor Alexander Lebed.
</P>
<P>
   But the US position on Kosovo is supported by its European
allies. ``Those who consider themselves friends of Serbia should
influence Belgrade to accept a peaceful political solution to the
Kosovo problem,'' German's Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer told
reporters in Moscow Thursday. ``The alternative is war.''

 &HT;    Galarraga faces toughest task
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _His career has been disrupted before.
</P>
<P>
   Racked by a sequence injuries, Andres Galarraga went through
times in the early 1990s when baseball had gotten away from him,
when some people insisted that he was finished. He persevered then.
And when informed Thursday that he had cancer in his lower back,
Galarraga found himself thinking the same things.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's dealing with this as if he was dealing with an injury,''
said Fernando Cuza, Galarraga's agent. ``The way he's looking at it
is, 'Okay, I can deal with it. I'll get better, and my goal is to
come back next year.' Hopefully, with the treatments, he'll respond
properly.''
</P>
<P>
   No one suggested Thursday -- when the Atlanta Braves disclosed
their first baseman had been diagnosed with lymphoma -- that
Galarraga's career is over. The strain of cancer, isolated in a
bone in his lower spine, has been treated successfully among
athletes, most notably golfer Paul Azinger, who resumed a
successful career after a year off for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga, 37, remains at Piedmont Hospital, taking the first
doses in a five-month program of chemotherapy. That will be
followed by radiation treatments. He is expected to return to his
hometown of West Palm Beach this weekend, his 1999 season finished
before it ever started. But doctors emphasized that his prognosis
is strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the positives here is that it involves a relatively
small area of that bone in his lower back,'' said Braves
orthopedist Lee Kelley. ``Obviously, a larger area of bone
involvement would have led to the need for surgery or led to some
structural changes that could have compromised his ability to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we didn't see that in this particular case. The rule in
these types of problems is that with treatment of both chemotherapy
and radiation, the bone part typically heals. The structural part
(of the back) does not pose a long-term problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga had flown to Atlanta on Monday for an MRI, after
Kelley grew suspicious of what was thought to be a nagging back
strain. Following a biopsy that revealed the disease, Galarraga was
joined at Piedmont by his wife, Eneyda. The couple has three
daughters, aged 13, 7 and 11 months. Galarraga did not attend
Thursday's briefing, but Cuza read his hand-written statement.
Those Braves who already had assembled for spring training in Lake
Buena Vista, Fla., were informed of the announcement in
mid-afternoon. Ryan Klesko, the left fielder who remained subject
of trade discussions all offseason, inherits Galarraga's position
at first base. But baseball was hardly the day's first topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously a horrible blow personally and no question a
blow to the team,'' Braves president Stan Kasten said. ``But these
things have happened before. Usually, they're injuries. We're a
very deep team. We've never been positioned as well as we are now
to continue on. . . . But we're also comforted by today's results,
which suggest he's going to be fine. But it's going to take some
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga signed a three-year, $24,75 million contract with the
team in November of 1997. In his first Atlanta season, he led the
team in homers (44), RBIs (121) and slugging percentage (.595) in
the best season ever by a Braves first baseman. Noted for his
brutal offseason training regimen, it was lower back pain first
noticed while training in November that led to this week's
discovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``He actually seemed to be recovering, but he had a persisting
pain that was limiting his ability to run and swing a bat,'' Kelley
said. ``He and I got together again in the first part of February
and decided to proceed with an MRI. It was not a very impressive
pain, but the fact that it limited his activity raised concerns,
and that's what led to the discovery of this area in his spine.''

AUTO INSURERS INCREASE DISCOUNTS FOR SAFEST DRIVERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Fearing the loss of customers to competitors, several
major auto insurance companies are increasing the discounts they
offer to the state's best drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials say the new filings, coming just a couple of
weeks after the insurers said they couldn't afford bigger discounts
because state-set base rates were inadequate, are likely to be
copied by the rest of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce Insurance of Webster, the state's largest auto insurer
with more than a fifth of all drivers, said Thursday it planned to
increase the discount it offers drivers in the Step 9 safe-driver
classification to 8 percent, from 5 percent. On a typical $800
premium, that's an extra savings of $24.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty Mutual Insurance Group of Boston and Metropolitan Life
Auto &AMP; Home of Warwick, R.I., made similar announcements earlier in
the week, but industry officials said the move by industry giant
Commerce meant most other companies would probably have to follow
suit to remain competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Horace Mann of Springfield, Ill., seemed to confirm that trend
Thursday when it showed up for a state hearing on its earlier
discount filing and said it planned to increase its Step 9 discount
from 14 percent to 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That discount is the highest in the industry, but other
companies come close to matching it by combining good-driver with
group discounts. For example, more than 500,000 members of the
American Automobile Association receive a 6 percent discount from
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Arbella Mutual Insurance Group of Quincy, the state's
second-largest insurer, hasn't amended its 5 percent discount for
Step 9 drivers yet. But the company has asked state regulators to
delay final action on that discount for a week, a strong signal
that it may be amended upward.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers had sought a 15.5 percent increase in base rates this
year and, when state regulators trimmed that to just 0.7 percent,
they challenged the ruling in court. After reductions in the base
rate the prior four years, big Massachusetts auto insurers made no
secret of the fact that they hoped the discounting frenzy of the
last few years would die down.
</P>
<P>
   But the fear of losing customers to competitors apparently
forced the companies to alter their strategy. Anthony J. Battista,
a spokesman for Commerce, said two weeks ago that inadequate state
rates made higher discounts impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still maintain the rates are inadequate,'' he said
Thursday, ``but it's competition and we want to make sure our rates
our adequate to protect our market share.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the original deadline for discount filings,
Commerce and most other insurers offered just 5 percent discounts
to Step 9 drivers and 3 percent discounts to Step 10 drivers. Last
year, the discounts had been 15 percent and 4 percent,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The only exceptions among major carriers this year were Premier
Insurance of Worcester, which offered an 8 percent discount to Step
9 drivers and a 5 percent discount to Step 10 drivers, and Hanover
Insurance, at 7 percent and 3 percent. Led by Horace Mann, a
handful of companies with a tiny market presence here offered
discounts to Step 9 drivers in the 10 to 14 percent range.
</P>
<P>
   Step 9 drivers represent about 57 percent of all the state's
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen J. D'Amato, a former top official at the state Division
of Insurance, said he believes companies began amending their
filings this week because they were nervous about losing their
customers to the smaller firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Step 9 drivers actuarially deserve a double-digit
discount, an 8 percent discount is still a great deal for the
companies. As Horace Mann showed, there's plenty of room for deeper
discounts,'' D'Amato said.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato said the amended filings also undercut company claims
that state-set base rates are inadequate. ``This is an industry
that's certainly not behaving like it's losing money. I don't know
how the insurers can argue with a straight face that rates are
inadequate,'' he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ For a decade, Kurds have been moving into Germany
seeking political asylum, and on Thursday one of them, Amin Aram,
walked into the Kurdish Community Center here, took a tea from a
friend and declared, ``Every one of us, without exception, is
angry.''
</P>
<P>
   A window cleaner, Aram, 31, is one of 210,000 Kurds who have
come here since 1989, fleeing various forms of violence. Unlike
Abdullah Ocalan, the Kurdish rebel leader arrested by Turkish
agents on Monday, he is from Iraq, not Turkey. He says that he is
no supporter of Ocalan's Kurdish Workers Party.
</P>
<P>
   Such political divisions have long undermined the scattered
Kurds in their battle for a homeland. But for the overwhelming
majority of the estimated 850,000 Kurds now living in Europe,
Ocalan's arrest constitutes a moment when differences are swept
away, however fleetingly, by a shared sense of outrage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American government says Ocalan is a terrorist,'' Aram
said. ``But my family was called `terrorists' by Saddam Hussein
just because we are Kurds. Then he killed my mother, three brothers
and two sisters in a chemical-weapons attack on the town of
Halabja. Whatever group we are from, we cannot accept Ocalan's
arrest.''
</P>
<P>
   Long focused on the problems arising from the fight for new
nation-states in the Balkans, European governments have abruptly
awakened this week to another conflict in their midst, one quietly
fed over many years by a fast-growing Kurdish diaspora in Europe,
which this week revealed an ability to organize, communicate and
act.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Kurds on Thursday ended a three-day occupation of the
Greek Embassy in London and protests in most places abated, tension
remained high.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, where three Kurds were killed by Israeli security
guards on Wednesday as they tried to enter Israel's Berlin
consulate, Kurdish protesters hurled gasoline bombs on Thursday
through the windows of a Turkish cultural center in Heilbronn and
attacked visitors with baseball bats. Three people were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, gasoline bombs were thrown at two Turkish travel
agencies in the port of Bremen, Germany, and Kurdish protesters
forced their way into the regional U.N. headquarters in Vienna,
Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Conversations with Kurds in several European countries suggest
that the broad show of defiance this week reflected developments
likely to weigh on the continent for some time: the growing
sophistication of Ocalan's movement, which has waged a separatist
war in southeastern Turkey that has left 30,000 dead; anger
stronger than any internal Kurdish differences, and the
helter-skelter growth of a Kurdish population in Europe that had
come to represent a large pool of restive national sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Magnus Ranstorp, an expert on Middle Eastern Affairs at St.
Andrew University in Scotland, said, ``The arrest of Ocalan has
united the Kurdish nation.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``What European governments do not see is that in many
ways the Kurdish struggle reflects the early days of the
Palestinian struggle: putting an issue on the international agenda
through terrorism. The situation could become more and more
inflamed.''
</P>
<P>
   In Greece on Thursday the ministers of foreign affairs, the
interior and public order resigned as public criticism raged over
the country's role in the arrest of Ocalan. And Kenya, where Ocalan
was seized after leaving the Greek Embassy in Nairobi, also
reshuffled its cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest followed several months of detention and flight in
Italy, Russia, Greece and elsewhere _ a fugitive existence for
Ocalan, that, it now seems, provided a kind of slow-motion prologue
to the current drama, fueling the Kurds' anger and sense of
abandonment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to warn Western governments this would happen,'' said
Kendal Nezan, the chairman of the moderate Kurdish Institute of
Paris, which opposes the guerrilla tactics of Ocalan's followers.
``I said, `Give Ocalan asylum in exchange for a formal renunciation
of violence.' But the Italian government told me there was too much
diplomatic pressure from America and too much economic pressure
from Turkey.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has defined the Kurdish Workers Party as a
terrorist organization and, in recent months, has persistently
expressed quiet support for Ocalan's arrest and his handover to
Turkey, which is a critical NATO ally and an important base for
U.S. air patrols over Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Nezan suggested that an effect of U.S. policy and European
governments' acquiescence to it had been to drive moderate Kurds
toward sympathy for Ocalan's violent movement. Kurds, he added, had
become convinced that the strategic importance of Turkey to the
United States was such that no Kurdish claims would ever be
recognized, let alone backed, in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the 850,000 Kurds in the European Union, probably 10
percent are in Ocalan's movement, and some are very militant,'' he
said. ``But a lot of people don't like his methods at all. Still,
in the end they are led to feel sympathy because they are so
revolted by Western policies.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 million Kurds live in an area that sprawls across
southeastern Turkey, Syria, Iran and Iraq. Of these, perhaps 12
million live in Turkey, where they had been promised a homeland in
the 1920 Treaty of Sevres after the fall of the Ottoman Empire. But
plans for a Kurdish homeland were dashed when Mustafa Kemal Ataturk
fought to regain the land.
</P>
<P>
   In Turkey, Kurds are not recognized as a minority, a status that
would allow them to educate their children in their own language. A
ban imposed by Turkey's last military government on the use of the
Kurdish language in unofficial settings was lifted in 1991, but
Kurdish remains illegal in broadcasts or in educational or
political settings, and there is a campaign under way to ban
Turkey's main pro-Kurdish party.
</P>
<P>
   Turks and Kurds have exchanged atrocities in recent years as
Turkey pursues a campaign to eradicate any Kurdish drive for
autonomy or independence.
</P>
<P>
   Faced by the explosive complexity of recognizing any Kurdish
claims, the frequent ruthlessness of Ocalan's methods and the
importance of Turkey as a NATO ally, Western governments have
generally preferred to look the other way, accepting Kurdish
refugees as a bearable price.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere has that stream of refugees been more intense than in
Germany, which has Europe's most liberal asylum laws. Indeed, with
more than 2 million Turks and about 500,000 Kurds now in the
country, the potential for further violence here is evident.
</P>
<P>
   Ciwan Bahoz, a member of the Kurdish Association for Culture and
Mutual Support, said that, like most Kurds in Germany, he rejected
Ocalan's violent methods. But at the same time he felt enraged by
the way Ocalan was treated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although I reject force, I somehow understand what the
protesters feel,'' he said. ``Ocalan has been humiliated. Europe
now has to understand that if it does not want Kurdish problems
settled on its streets, it must see that its NATO partner, Turkey,
complies with rules that govern any democratic country.''
</P>
<P>
   Like several other Kurds, Bahoz said it would have been far
better if Germany had agreed to try Ocalan, because at least he
would have been assured a fair trial. The German government
declined to request his extradition from Italy to face various
charges because of fear of the potentially explosive domestic
consequences.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   German officials said that the influence of the Kurdish Workers
Party had clearly been growing and that many of the cultural and
other associations in this country were merely fronts for the
organization. Fund raising _ involving pressure on Kurdish stores
and businesses _ was brisk and efficient, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Workers Party was once quite marginal,'' said Barbara
John, Berlin's commissioner for the affairs of foreigners. ``But
the various Kurdish associations have gradually been drawn toward
it. I would not say the party is the mainstream, but it is now the
undisputed representative of the fight for autonomy.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that by being extremely naive in its policies toward
asylum seekers and by failing to recognize that the admission of
hundreds of thousands of Kurds would inevitably have consequences,
Germany now finds itself in a very delicate situation in which
``the question of immigration and foreigners could become really
poisonous.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently aware of this danger of a backlash, Kurdish community
leaders throughout Europe appealed on Thursday for calm. ``We
appeal to our compatriots to behave in a level-headed way,'' said a
statement from the Kurdish Community in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear, however, that if level-headedness was not
conspicuous in recent days, it was not merely because of
spontaneous anger. Faruk Sarhat, a Paris-based member of Ocalan's
movement, said the party's central committee had the means to
quickly contact party cells and Kurdish cultural organizations
throughout the continent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our central committee said protests should be democratic, but
Ocalan is more than our party,'' said Sarhat, who described himself
as a member of the Kurdish Workers Party although he formally
represents a front organization called the Kurdistan National
Liberation Front. ``The kind of anger his arrest generated cannot
be controlled, especially when the role of the Israelis and
Americans was so clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many Kurds, Sarhat argued that Turkey does not have the
resources to swoop on Ocalan and arrest him in the heart of Africa
without assistance from other intelligence services. On Wednesday,
the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, adamantly denied
any Israeli role in Ocalan's capture. The denial by the United
States was less vehement.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the resources of Turkey, those of Kurdish groups in
Europe are clearly considerable, including a Kurdish-language
satellite television channel based in London that appears to have
played an important role in spreading the word of Ocalan's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party is very active in the diaspora extracting money from
Kurds, and the evidence of drug trafficking is also persuasive,''
said Ranstorp, the expert on Middle Eastern affairs. ``It is a
sophisticated, organized guerrilla organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of Ocalan's personal influence was clear this week in
the attempts at self-immolation by several protesters. Like Ho Chi
Minh, of whom he is a great admirer, Ocalan likes to be called
``Uncle'' (``Apo'' in Kurdish), and he frequently called his
followers' attention to the Vietnamese use of immolation as a
method of protest, Nezan said.
</P>
<P>
   But at the moment of his arrest, several Kurdish officials said,
he appeared to have been casting around for some kind of political
or diplomatic way out of the cycle of violence. Any possibility of
this now appears to have been dashed, especially if Ocalan's trial
in Turkey should end in a death sentence _ an explosive possibility
for a Europe full of disgruntled Kurds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not support the methods of the Kurdish Workers Party,''
said Kader Al-Yousef, a Kurdish technician in Berlin who came to
Germany as a student 24 years ago from Syria. ``But I cannot
condemn its objective when all it does is fight for our right to a
homeland.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Less than a year ago, BankBoston, an institution with a
venerable Brahmin lineage, was riding high.
</P>
<P>
   The bank had made a sharp turnaround from lending debacles of
the late 1980s. Among U.S. banks, only Citibank had a more
extensive consumer banking business in fast-growing _ and very
lucrative _ Latin American markets.
</P>
<P>
   So employees had every reason to celebrate last March at a party
at the bank's headquarters here, as they gathered to toast an
achievement that confers ultimate bragging rights on Wall Street: a
soaring stock price.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, BankBoston, whose customers once included Paul
Revere, is being buffeted by fears that Brazil's economic crisis
may overwhelm it.
</P>
<P>
   The bank has also been embarrassed by financial scandal, trading
losses and an untimely and expensive acquisition. Its stock has
plunged from its 52-week high at a time when mergers are sweeping
the banking industry. As a result, the bank is now seen by many
analysts as takeover bait.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're in a tough spot because the place where they have put
their bets is not the place you want to be right now,'' said Nancy
Bush, an analyst with Ryan Beck &AMP; Co. ``I think that their history
is somewhat against them, and I don't see them as an industry
survivor. I don't think they were prepared for the kind of damage
that was done to their stock because of Brazil and Argentina.''
</P>
<P>
   For a bank that has prided itself on its prowess in Latin
America, the setbacks of the last year have been particularly
humbling.
</P>
<P>
   Most large U.S. banks are only involved in lending to Latin
American borrowers. But BankBoston has extensive branches in Brazil
and Argentina and offers checking and savings accounts, credit
cards, mutual funds and other staples of consumer banking. Even its
president was born in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   And BankBoston, whose charter dating back to 1784 is the oldest
in the country, is no stranger to the perils of doing business in
Latin America. The bank set up shop in Argentina in 1917 to help
Massachusetts textile companies find new sources of wool. In 1947,
it made its first foray into Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil is plagued with unusually brutal economic problems right
now, and BankBoston lacks the overall heft of other banks that have
decided to run the risks of doing business there.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, BankBoston executives acknowledge the hardships
that blindsided them last year. But they remain confident that
BankBoston, an unusual hybrid of old-fashioned banking, corporate
lending and stock underwriting married to an extensive Latin
American operation, is well positioned for the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a time of change the likes of which I've never
seen,'' said Chad Gifford, chief executive of the BankBoston Corp.
But, he hastened to add, ``I feel no pressure to do a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, question how much time the bank has to convince
analysts and investors that its stock has been unfairly beaten up.
Brazil, where the bank has $6 billion in financial exposure, most
of it in the form of local lending, is still struggling with its
crisis. And there are worries that Brazil's troubles could spill
over into Argentina, where BankBoston has $9 billion in exposure.
</P>
<P>
   While other U.S. banks face losses in Latin America, BankBoston
is particularly vulnerable because its smaller size would give it
less padding to absorb a full-blown recession in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got this cloud hanging over them because of Latin
America, and they need to have that cloud dissipate,'' said Gerard
Cassidy, an analyst with Tucker Anthony Inc. ``It will dissipate,
but the question is when?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As home to Latin America's biggest economy, Brazil was a prized
destination for banks looking to find new ways to fill their
coffers. BankBoston expanded aggressively there in the last year
and is now the fourth-largest foreign bank in the country.
</P>
<P>
   But Brazil looked less attractive after Russia devalued its
currency and declared a debt moratorium last August. Brazil was
quickly sized up as the next victim of the financial contagion
spreading around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   The country spent several months defending its currency and
arranging for emergency funds before it too was forced to devalue
its currency last month. It is now scrambling to avoid a complete
economic collapse, and BankBoston has a front-row seat from which
to view the struggle.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston's senior executives are confident, however, that
Brazil's faltering economy will not drag BankBoston down with it.
Indeed, they argue, Brazilians have traditionally sought to stash
their savings in havens like BankBoston when times are tough,
meaning that the bank could actually profit from the turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Henrique Meirelles, BankBoston's Brazilian-born president, said
he was absolutely certain the bank could weather Brazil's storms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work at the top end of the market,'' he said, noting that
the bank's customers are among Brazil's wealthiest. In the credit
card business, for example, BankBoston has not flooded the
Brazilian market with cards, as Citigroup has, but has issued a far
smaller number to more wealthy customers.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts share the view that BankBoston is well provisioned
and well positioned to successfully negotiate Brazil's challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``BankBoston has the skill to remain successful despite the
ongoing crisis situation in Latin America,'' a Lehman Brothers
analyst, Diane Glossman, noted in a recent research report. ``We
continue to view these operations as a source of strength despite
the market's periodic `wall of worry.'''
</P>
<P>
   But clearly the market is very worried. In just seven months,
BankBoston's stock has tumbled from a high of $59.0625, shearing
about $6 billion from the company's market value. Thursday, the
stock closed at $38.0625, up 43.75 cents, and ahead of a 52-week
low of $25.75 reached in October.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian crisis has not been the only source of problems
for BankBoston. The company was hit with some big losses last year
from a well-publicized fraud and from trading miscues. Both events
raised questions about the quality of BankBoston's financial
controls.
</P>
<P>
   The fraud proved particularly embarrassing because it involved
its prized Latin American franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo S. Carrasco, head of BankBoston's private banking
operation in New York, has been charged with embezzling $66 million
in fraudulent loans to an Argentine businessman, Oldemar C.
Barreiro. The loans were made even though BankBoston's Argentine
operation had earlier raised alarms about Barreiro's background.
Carrasco disappeared after company officials asked him to a meeting
to explain the loans; he remains at large.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in last year's third quarter, BankBoston's trading
operation booked a $52 million loss because of errant bets made by
the bank's emerging-markets desk in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Those losses, combined with the scandal in the private bank,
raised concerns among analysts about how tight a lid BankBoston was
keeping on its diverse businesses. Gifford and other senior
executives said they had reorganized the trading operation and the
private bank and were better equipped to monitor lurking problems
in those areas.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the real challenge facing BankBoston should its Latin
American franchise stall will be the ability of other parts of the
company to pick up the slack.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, BankBoston earned $792 million on revenue of $4.4
billion compared with $879 million on revenue of $4 billion in
1997. Less than 20 percent of its profits came from its Latin
American operation; the bulk of the bank's profits, about 67
percent, came from its corporate banking and regional banking
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   While the corporate banking business almost buried BankBoston
under a pile of bad real estate and overseas loans a decade ago, it
has since emerged as one of the main engines of growth for the
company. But trading losses and a pricey acquisition last year
caused the corporate business to sputter.
</P>
<P>
   Like other banks, including the Bankers Trust Corp. and the
BankAmerica Corp., BankBoston bought an investment bank to bolster
its presence on Wall Street. But the $800 million BankBoston paid
to acquire the boutique investment banking firm Robertson Stephens
last September is now viewed, with benefit of hindsight, as too
hefty.
</P>
<P>
   While Robertson Stephens was best known for its shepherding
technology companies to market, soon after after its acquisition,
initial public offerings and stock underwritings dried up because
of the financial turmoil abroad. BankBoston said Robertson
Stephens' problems were only temporary and that it, and the larger
corporate business, should produce solid gains this year.
</P>
<P>
   The last leg of BankBoston's business, its consumer banking
business in New England, has had deeper flaws.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, BankBoston bought BayBanks Inc., New England's
leading consumer bank, for $2 billion in an effort to strengthen
this side of the business. But the companies had problems meshing
their operations, causing headaches for customers of both banks and
requiring an infusion of extra funds to bring the lagging
operations up to speed.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston recently appointed a well-regarded executive,
Bradford H. Warner, to oversee the retail business and hired the
former head of technology at Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. to help
reinvigorate the consumer operation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the clock is ticking.
</P>
<P>
   With BankBoston's stock price low and investor expectations
high, the bank may not have as much time as it would like to ride
out problems here and in Latin America that may only be temporary.
That is why analysts and investment bankers see the company as
vulnerable to a takeover bid. Among the companies seen as possible
bidders for BankBoston are Fleet Financial Group Inc., the First
Union Corp., the Mellon Bank Corp. and the Chase Manhattan Corp..
</P>
<P>
   Should Citigroup's move to meld banking and insurance operations
ultimately pass muster with regulators, some investment bankers
speculate that BankBoston may end up being acquired by the John
Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co.
</P>
<P>
   The dream deal for those advocating greater financial
deregulation, and for loyal Bostonians hoping to retain a hometown
financial services giant, would be a merger of BankBoston, John
Hancock and the FMR Corp., the mutual fund heavyweight that is the
parent of Fidelity Investments.
</P>
<P>
   As the speculation grows, BankBoston's Gifford says he intends
to remain focused on the basics of running his bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the time for execution for the bank,'' he said. ``We
have to show increasingly and on a consistent basis that these
businesses can perform.'' &QL;

JEFFREY COHELAN, 84, ADVOCATE OF LIBERAL CAUSES IN CONGRESS 
 (DW) 

</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif.)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former Rep. Jeffery Cohelan, a liberal Democrat
from California who served in the House for 12 years before
becoming executive director of the Group Health Association in
1970, died Monday at his home in Washington. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was Parkinson's disease and cancer, his son Timothy,
of San Diego, said.
</P>
<P>
   In his years in Congress, which spanned the politically
turbulent period from 1958 to 1970, Cohelan was an advocate for
civil rights, the environmental movement and labor causes. His
district included half the industrial city of Oakland and the
University of California at Berkeley, where student protests
erupted over the issue of free speech and the right to assembly in
1964. Later in the 1960s the campus became a center of the antiwar
movement.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, Cohelan served on the government Operations
Committee, the District of Columbia Committee and the Armed
Services Committee. He was a sponsor of the Civil Rights Act of
1964 and floor leader for the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Cohelan also co-sponsored legislation in 1968 that established
Redwood National Park, on the northwestern coast of California, and
Point Reyes National Seashore, 20 miles northwest of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   An early supporter of the Vietnam War, Cohelan saw his career
fell victim to the antiwar movement in 1970. He lost his seat in
the 1970 Democratic primary to a Berkeley city councilman, Ronald
Dellums, who opposed the war and the military draft. Dellums went
on to serve 14 terms in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Cohelan was a milk truck driver in the San Francisco area in
1942 when he was elected secretary-treasurer of Local 302 of the
Milk Drivers and Dairy Employees Union. As an undergraduate at
Berkeley, he continued to be active in the union, helping to start
an in-house union newspaper and initiating a federal credit union.
He went on to serve as a labor consultant for the University of
California.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from the university in 1950 as an economics
major, Cohelan studied at Leeds and Oxford Universities in 1953 as
a Fulbright Scholar. In 1955 he was elected to the Berkeley City
Council.
</P>
<P>
   After his defeat in the Democratic primary in 1970, Cohelan
became a senior director of the Group Health Association of
America, a Vanguard health care organization. He retired from the
health association in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his son Timothy, Cohelan is survived by his wife of 60
years, Evelyn Cohelan of Washington; another son, Terrence, of
Santa Cruz, Calif.; two daughters, Pamela Benson of Washington and
Catherine Ulmer of Walnut Creek, Calif.; a sister, six
grandchildren and a great-grandson.

`RONIN' DIRECTOR FRANKEHEIMER HAS ENDURED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 
  
By ROB LOWMAN 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Robert De Niro plays Sam, an American veteran of
the espionage game, in the thriller ``Ronin,'' which debuts on
video Tuesday. From the outset, it's quite clear that despite his
age and haggard look, Sam is no burnout. He has survived in his
dangerous profession on skill, wiles and guts.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of guts, in one scene the wounded Sam instructs his
cohorts on how to remove a bullet from his side. ``I once removed a
guy's appendix with a grapefruit spoon,'' he says matter-of-factly.
After steering them through the operation, Sam deadpans: ``You
think you can stitch me up on your own? If you don't mind, I'm
gonna pass out.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran director John Frankenheimer (``The Manchurian
Candidate,'' ``52 Pick-Up'') must have had more than a few moments
of recognition while shooting that scene.
</P>
<P>
   After more than 40 years in the business, Frankenheimer has
endured countless barbs and arrows from critics as well as numerous
ups and downs in the industry. Yet the filmmaker, who turns 69
today, has survived. And unlike a lot of his contemporaries, he's
still in the game.
</P>
<P>
   This is more due to Frankenheimer's adaptability than his
particular style. It's interesting to see what two of the deans of
film criticism in the '60s and '70s said about Frankenheimer. In
1969, critic Andrew Sarris called him a ``director of parts at the
expense of the whole.'' While Pauline Kael complained that the plot
to ``Grand Prix'' was ``kind of cheap,'' she didn't mind the
crashes because they were ``gorgeous.''
</P>
<P>
   Those comments sum up much of the knocks against Frankenheimer.
Having learned his craft in early live TV, he was always willing to
push technique (Frankenheimer was one of the first directors to
extensively use hand-held cameras). But that didn't mean that he
shied away from interesting subjects or didn't address substantive
issues.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1965 film ``The Train,'' starring Burt Lancaster, he asks
if the preservation of art is worth the sacrifice of human life.
And certainly ``Candidate,'' ``Seven Days in May,'' ``Seconds'' and
``The Birdman of Alcatraz'' are thought-provoking films.
</P>
<P>
   But Frankenheimer has never made a great film. Perhaps he
doesn't have the singular artistic vision necessary to do so. That,
however, seems to be his saving grace: smart enough to do something
interesting but flexible enough to roll with the punches. When
Frankenheimer's movie career seemed at an end in the '80s and early
'90s, he returned to television to do movies there. A couple of
Emmys helped resuscitate his career. Now with the success of
``Ronin,'' Frankenheimer isn't thought of as an old-timer past his
prime.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Ronin,'' you can see Frankenheimer's strengths and
weaknesses. Basically a chase movie in which the Irish Republican
Army hires five mercenaries, including De Niro and Jean Reno, to
retrieve a briefcase. (Nobody ever finds out what's in the
briefcase. It's a McGuffin, Hitchcock's term for a plot device that
essentially switches on the action because everybody cares about
it.)
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of stylized action, plus twists and turns in the
plot. The dialogue, which reportedly was punched up by David Mamet,
is suitably professionally tough-guyish. In short, it's an
entertaining thriller; it's just not really about much on that
level.
</P>
<P>
   There is one thread running through it, though, that seems
familiar: Hard-boiled Sam falls for the IRA paymistress, Deirdre
(Natascha McElhone). It seems that no matter how tough the guy is
in a Frankenheimer film, he always has a soft spot, and sometimes
that's good, and sometimes it's not.

GORE MAINTAINS STRONG TIES TO AFRICAN LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ When American presidents look abroad for one
among their peers whose ideology and style matches their own, they
often gaze toward London. Ronald Reagan had Margaret Thatcher. Bill
Clinton has Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
   But if Al Gore wins the White House next year, he might be more
likely to look toward Africa than Europe. Gore shares a remarkable
relationship with Thabo Mbeki, the man who will almost certainly
succeed South Africa's Nelson Mandela a few months from now.
</P>
<P>
   In the past five years, the two leaders-in-waiting have forged
ties never before seen between American and African statesmen.
</P>
<P>
   They are intellectual equals, each a philosopher in different
ways: Gore on science and progress, Mbeki on the reformation of
Africa. Gore writes books, Mbeki drafts his own speeches. Both
possess a private charm that seldom transmits on television. And
the two genuinely seem to like each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton and Blair deserve each other, Gore and Mbeki deserve
each other,'' says John Stremlau, a visiting professor at the
University of the Witswatersrand in Johannesburg. ``To think we
could end up with two real thinking leaders . . . holy cow,
wouldn't that be something.''
</P>
<P>
   South Africa got a closer look at the personal chemistry that
could shape its relationship with Washington. During a two-day trip
to Cape Town with five Cabinet members and a plethora of advisers
that ended Thursday, Gore co-chaired with Mbeki the latest meeting
of the US-South Binational Commission, concluding the talks with
new cooperative agreements on trade, crime prevention, and job
creation. Gore's visit was delayed a year when Clinton requested he
remain in Washington during a flare-up in the Iraqi conflict last
February.
</P>
<P>
   While much of Clinton's ballyhooed Africa agenda has been
derailed by wars in Congo, Sierra Leone, Angola, and along the
Ethiopia-Eritrea border, the binational commission remains a vital
forum for progress between the US and the troubled continent. One
of only five such organs _ the others involve Mexico, Russia,
Ukraine, and Egypt _ it is composed of 10 cabinet-level committees
and more than 100 working groups that enable Washington and
Pretoria to share information on everything from fishing tackle to
crop-threatening moths.
</P>
<P>
   The commission might be more form than substance, Stremlau
argues, but the form is important. The United States is the top
investor in South Africa, and enjoys an $800 million trade surplus.
South Africa, meanwhile, remains Washington's most stable and
important entry point onto the African continent. US Cabinet
officials seem to line up to come. Commerce Secretary William Daley
returned with Gore for his third visit in five months. Defense
chief William Cohen was here two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The trade agreement, negotiated months ago but signed Thursday,
provides new mechanisms to resolve longstanding disagreements
between Washington and Pretoria on pharmaceutical copyrights, steel
dumping, and South Africa's ties with Cuba. A separate arrangement
brokered by Attorney General Janet Reno and her South African
counterparts calls for the United States to share expertise in
crime prevention with local prosecutors and police.
</P>
<P>
   But the most important function of the commission has been the
way it has served as a vehicle for Gore and Mbeki. The two have
presided over the organ since its creation in 1994, and that work
has forged a balanced relationship rather than one dominated by a
senior Western partner. That is crucial for Mbeki, whose vision of
foreign affairs is founded on the premise that African states have
the right to stand as equals in the community of nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thabo's approach is that we need a strategic partnership with
America, but one that does not frustrate Africa's ability to evolve
according to its own interests,'' said one of Mbeki's advisers, who
requested to not be named. ``Unlike Mandela, Mbeki has had time to
build personal and practical ties with his US counterpart.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaching beyond the nuts and bolts of policy, which they are
able to discuss with equal agility, Gore and Mbeki share a concern
that taps the most fundamental connection between the two
countries: how to overcome the long, painful struggles against
racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``What bonds South Africa and the US together as peoples is that
we still have to purge our souls of racism,'' Stremlau said.
``These are the two countries that most manifest that struggle. And
these two guys _ Gore and Mbeki _ each belong to a generation
shaped by that struggle.''

CONFLICTS THREATEN US ROLE IN AFRICA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Nearly a year after president Clinton visited
Africa and pledged to help prevent Rwandan-style genocide from
spreading across the continent, the United States has left Africa
to its own fate as it faces its worst security crisis since
independence swept across the continent three decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   With the arrival Thursday of Vice President Al Gore in South
Africa to boost trade with the economic powerhouse, a welter of
civil and ethnic conflicts engulfing more than a dozen nations in
sub-Saharan Africa has cast a pall over the visit. And they
threaten America's hope that an African ``renaissance,'' marked by
sustained economic growth and spreading democracies, will reverse
the fortunes of the continent.
</P>
<P>
   American political and military leaders have dismissed appeals
from Britain and the United Nations to play a more active role in
restoring regional stability. In some cases, as in Sierra Leone,
the United States has actively thwarted efforts by the United
Nations to take on peacekeeping operations that might have
prevented some of Africa's wars, according to European and UN
diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   Senior US officials say that the situation merely underscores
the dimensions of American power in an area of limited economic and
strategic interests, and that Africa's leaders are responsible for
solving their most serious problems. American reticence also
illustrates Washington's enduring anxiety over its experiences in
Somalia, where 18 US Army rangers were killed in 1993 during an
ambush that ended American military intervention in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't be everywhere, we can't do everything, nor should we
try,'' US National Security Adviser Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger said
recently. ``That means at times we'll be criticized because there
is fighting in Sierra Leone and we're not stopping it.''
</P>
<P>
   The unfolding crisis has fueled charges from critics across a
broad political and ideological spectrum that the Clinton
administration has oversold its commitment to Africa and is now
witnessing the consequences of its neglect.
</P>
<P>
   Accusations are rife that many of the administration's top
Africa policy-makers and special envoys, from Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson to Assistant Secretary of State Susan Rice, have
mishandled many of the crises that they have sought to resolve.
``They talk big but they act small,'' said Salih Booker, an analyst
at the Council on Foreign Relations. ``The problem is that the
United States has been unable to demonstrate that it can fix one
thing in Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   The growing sense of futility has taken its toll on the US State
Department's Bureau of African Affairs. Demoralized by a series of
policy reversals, the bombings of embassies in Kenya and Tanzania,
and the historical neglect of Africa by the top administration
officials, dejected foreign service veterans have been taking
assignments elsewhere in the world, according to former State
Department officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone in the Africa department has to shake his head and
shrug when they hear President Clinton or an administration
spokesman talk about how America has always neglected Africa and
now we are going to do something,'' said William Foltz, a Yale
University professor who served as a senior adviser on Africa to
the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   The latest setback for the administration occurred on the Horn
of Africa, where a dispute between two former African allies,
Ethiopia and Eritrea, erupted into full scale war last week despite
months of American diplomatic efforts to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   A dispirited Anthony Lake, the former US National Security
Adviser and the last of a string of American mediators to travel to
the region, recently confessed to the UN's senior Africa envoy,
Mohamed Sahnoun: ``I'm more or less at the end of the road.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent briefing to the UN Security Council, UN Secretary
General Kofi Annan delivered a grim prognosis on the region's
health.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's rather depressing,'' said Annan, the UN's first
leader from sub-Saharan Africa, who hails from Ghana. ``Compared
with other continents, we are weak, but divided and conflict-ridden
I don't think we stand a chance in moving on to economic and social
development.''
</P>
<P>
   The gloomy picture has overshadowed some of the greatest African
success stories of the last decade: the bloodless transfer of power
from the apartheid regime to a black government in South Africa;
the end of long civil wars in Namibia and Mozambique; the flowering
of elected governments from Mali to Benin; and the coming elections
in Nigeria, where the sudden death country's former ruler --
General Sani Abacha -- has raised hopes for some form of democracy
in Africa's most populous nation.
</P>
<P>
   During his 11-day visit to Africa last March, the first ever by
a sitting US president, Clinton predicted that continent was headed
for better days. He pledged to boost trade, support democratic
governments and raise Africa's profile on the American policy
agenda. He also apologized for American inaction during the worst
African genocide in modern history -- the 1994 slaughter of more
than 500,000 Rwandans. ``It is time for America to put a new Africa
on our maps,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the visit, the US has watched helplessly as simmering
conflicts have broken out into full-scale war in the Congo, the
Republic of Congo, Angola, Guinea-bissau, Sierra Leone and along
the border of Eritrea and Ethiopia. And a ``new generation'' of
African leaders lauded by the administration began behaving like
old-fashioned aggressors, stirring up trouble from the Red Sea to
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   The administration, meanwhile, has failed to gain passage in the
Senate of a bill - The Africa Growth and Opportunity Act -- that
would have Africa granted duty-free access to American markets for
African businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The trade law ``is viewed as the single most important emblem of
the United State's commitment to a new relationship with Africa,''
Rice said in recent testimony on Capitol Hill. ``If you...in the
Congress are unable to help us fulfill this promise, I think it
might call into question in many minds in Africa the sincerity and
durability of the US commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   UN diplomats say the United States, reluctant to assume new
financial commitments in Africa, has routinely blocked the creation
of UN missions. In Sierra Leone, Washington dragged out discussions
on a British proposal to deploy peace-keepers to halt a rebel
offensive in the winter of 1997. By May, guerrilla forces drove the
first elected president into exile.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, a UN proposal to post a battalion of peace-keepers
in the Republic of Congo was torpedoed by the Clinton
administration after it concluded that Congress would not pay for
the mission, which would have cost the US less than $100,000,
according to Sahnoun. The country soon exploded into civil war,
prompting the invasion of the country by the Angolan army.
</P>
<P>
   America thus far has reduced its financial commitment to a
Nigeria-lead peace keeping force -- from $3.9 million in 1998 to
$1.3 million this year. And in a visit to South Africa last week,
Defense Secretary William Cohen made it clear American support is
limited to helping the Africans create their own peacekeeping
mission to deal with future wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a new mantra: that we don't have any influence.''
said Chester Crocker, the former Assistant Secretary of State for
African affairs. ``I don't buy it. We are a special country and,
damn it, we have influence.''

CLEMENS AGREES TO PLAY FOR YANKEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA _ The far-fetched fantasy of Roger Clemens one day
returning to the Red Sox dissolved Thursday into the nightmare
scenario of the five-time Cy Young Award winner wearing pinstripes,
the Bambino redux.
</P>
<P>
   Not satisfied to return a team that won an American
League-record 114 games last season and their 24th World Series
title, the New York Yankees Thursday traded for Clemens in perhaps
their most sensational acquisition since buying Babe Ruth from Red
Sox owner Harry Frazee for $125,000 and a $300,000 loan in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, exercising a handshake agreement he had with
then-Toronto CEO Paul Beeston that he could demand a trade if the
Blue Jays were not contenders, agreed to a deal that sent him to
the Yankees for lefthanded pitcher David Wells, whose 18 wins last
season included the only regular-season perfect game in Yankee
history; lefthanded reliever Graeme Lloyd, who did not allow a run
in Yankee Stadium last season and had a 1.67 earned run average in
50 appearances; and second baseman Homer Bush, who last spring was
voted the team's top prospect and hit .380 in limited action.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll come in here and he'll be turned on by New York and if
New York doesn't get turned on by him, I'll be very surprised,''
said Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, who was spurned two years
ago by Clemens when he left Boston as a free agent and signed with
Toronto despite being offered more money by the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll fit in here so well. We've got warriors here, and we're
getting a guy who's a great warrior. He's a monster. He's a
warrior. `Just give me the ball.' That's him.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, who has two years and $16.1 million left on the
four-year deal he signed with the Blue Jays, said he expected to
arrive here by midday Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, Mr. Steinbrenner came to Houston and I elected
to go to Toronto,'' said Clemens, who said he gave his consent to
the Yankee deal Wednesday night to his agent, Randy Hendricks, and
shortly thereafter received phone calls from Steinbrenner and
Yankees manager Joe Torre.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get that kind of second chance too often. I just
want to slip in a side door and go to work with these guys and
hopefully fit in.''
</P>
<P>
   When Clemens first made it known he wanted to be traded from
Toronto before last July's trading deadline, Red Sox general
manager Dan Duquette inquired about his availability and repeatedly
did so again after the season. But the Red Sox were never a
contender for the services of the pitcher who has won 41 games in
the two seasons since Duquette predicted he was entering the
twilight of his career. There is a belief in Red Sox circles that
the Blue Jays would not trade Clemens to a team that might compete
against them for a wild-card spot.
</P>
<P>
   At least one Boston TV station, Channel 7, broke into regular
programming Thursday morning to report the trade. In Fort Myers,
Fla., Red Sox players in camp ahead of Saturday's official opening
reacted with disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ``What am I going to do?'' said pitcher Tim Wakefield, who
uttered an expletive when he heard the news. ``He's the best
pitcher in the game by far in the last 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette issued a short statement from Boston. ``It's just going
to make the rivalry between the Red Sox and Yankees that much more
interesting and intense for our fans,'' he said through club
spokesman Kevin Shea.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays, who had been unable to trade Clemens during last
December's winter meetings in Nashville when the Houston Astros
rebuffed Clemens's request for a $27 million extension, reportedly
were close Wednesday to sending Clemens to the Texas Rangers for a
package of players that included top prospect Ruben Mateo. The
Astros also were still in the bidding. Either the Rangers or Astros
would have satisfied Clemens's stated desire to pitch closer to his
home in Katy, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But Toronto GM Gord Ash made a final run at the Yankees,
dropping his request for some of the Yankees' top young players,
including outfielder Ricky Ledee and pitcher Ramiro Mendoza, and
asking instead for Wells, the tattooed character known for his
unbuttoned uniform jersey and Metallica CD collection who had
achieved near folk-hero status in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't think (Clemens) was still on our radar screen at
all,'' said Yankees GM Brian Cashman, who said Ash had brought up
Clemens in their numerous phone conversations this winter. ``And
then we got hit with something entirely different.''
</P>
<P>
   Cashman said hearing the Blue Jays' last proposal ``made my
knees buckle.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells also was physically affected when he learned of the deal.
Visibly upset, he was rendered near-speechless, and asked reporters
for a couple of days to collect his thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some shock in that room right now,'' Torre said of the
Yankee clubhouse, which until Thursday's trade had all but one of
its players (outfielder Tim Raines) returning from its championship
run. ``It's something you have to get used to. That is what the
game is all about. There are going to be changes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who this week lost arbitration cases to shortstop
Derek Jeter and closer Mariano Rivera, will have a payroll well in
excess of $80 million with the addition of Clemens. By contrast,
the Red Sox have 20 players under contract for approximately $58
million.
</P>
<P>
   Cashman said the Yankees rejected an invitation from Ash to
speak with Clemens's agents prior to the completion of the deal.
``He said, `Do you want to talk to the agents in the next 72
hours?' '' Cashman said. ``We said no, we'll take him on and see
what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner said he expects to negotiate a contract extension
with Clemens sometime this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Roger is going to pitch four or five more years of
good baseball,'' Steinbrenner said.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner said he was willing to make the trade in part
because he didn't want the Yankees to become complacent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I harken back to old Satchel Paige,'' he said. ``I used to
love ol' Satchel Paige. People would ask him, `When you walk in
from the bullpen, why are you walking so slow?' He said, `I'm
looking over my shoulder to see if someone is gaining on me.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I'm doing here.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens will almost certainly have to relinquish his No. 21,
worn by Yankee mainstay Paul O'Neill. What number will he take
instead?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're going to give me No. 12,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The last Yankee to wear that number also had Red Sox ties: Wade
Boggs.
</P>
<P>
   How will Clemens feel, returning to Fenway Park in a Yankee
uniform?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it will be any different from coming through
there as a visitor,'' he said, then apparently reconsidered. ``I
think maybe it'll be a little different, once it sinks in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just another great challenge.''

ING-BARINGS PLANS TO STICK WITH EMERGING MARKETS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: England, Netherlands)  By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though misery had plenty of company in emerging markets last
year, few international firms had as much at stake or suffered as
much as the Dutch investment bank ING Barings. A whirlwind of
executive departures and steep losses put its future in question,
with some analysts predicting that the descendant of Britain's
once-mighty Barings would largely disappear.
</P>
<P>
   The two men newly appointed to head ING Barings, the investment
banking unit of ING Groep, David Robins, its chief executive, and
Michel Tilmant, its chairman, want to dispel such notions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some clients said they worried that we would disengage''
Tilmant said. ``We have made it clear that we will continue to
service them all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The two are touring the United States, Europe and Asia to
explain a just-completed reorganization plan. The plan will put ING
Barings, based in London, under greater scrutiny from its parent's
corporate banking headquarters in Amsterdam and merge some
operations that were once separate. Costs will be cut everywhere.
But the bank intends to keep its foot in emerging markets and even
rebuild a presence in Latin America, where it hurriedly cut its
staff last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked what makes us special,'' said Robins, who took over
as chief executive amid the market turmoil in the fall. ``The most
interesting part was the global scope, with a clear focus on
emerging markets. But we have to put together our capabilities
better than in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The reorganization comes after ING Groep announced that it would
cut about 12 percent of ING Barings' 10,000 employees after a $170
million loss in the third quarter of last year. The firm's two top
executives left, as did the chiefs of its debt and equity
departments and the chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Robins set the tone for what is expected to be a long and
difficult restructuring by foregoing his bonus for the year. He
said that he and several other senior executives gave up their
annual bonuses voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the spate of bad news, the bank's Dutch parent has
affirmed its commitment to operate a European-style ``universal''
bank, offering the full panoply of banking services. That means
maintaining a presence, albeit at lower costs, in the developing
countries ING Barings has long viewed as its specialty. Despite
recessions in many developing countries, core Dutch clients
continue to demand services abroad, Tilmant said.
</P>
<P>
   Like some other big European banks, ING Barings has found it
hard to compete against the big American investment banks. Robins
said it intended to focus more on middle-market companies in Europe
as well as America, where it owns Furman Selz, a New York
investment bank.

CLINTON RETURNS TO SCENE OF `COMEBACK' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ He laughed out loud at his own jokes, bolted
from his limousine to shake hands, and showcased his famous ability
to feel the pain of others.
</P>
<P>
   For a while Thursday, President Clinton made a return appearance
as candidate Clinton, the southern governor who rose from relative
obscurity to the presidency because voters here were willing to
forgive him and allow him to become the self-proclaimed ``comeback
kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, seeking to repair a presidency damaged by his impeachment,
Clinton came back again, this time for a stop on his long path
toward redemption.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from a brief health care event, Clinton spent most of the
day with various supporters from his 1992 presidential campaign,
the people who stood by him amid allegations of an affair with
cabaret singer Gennifer Flowers and questions about how he avoided
the Vietnam War draft.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived for the health care forum, he blew a kiss at
someone in the crowd, and lingered long after the event had ended,
shaking hands, hugging several in the audience, and posing for
pictures.
</P>
<P>
   After lunch at a restaurant in Merrimack, he stopped his
limousine and alighted from the car to shake hands with a crowd of
middle school students and adults, who held signs welcoming him to
the state.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Clinton spoke at the state Democratic Party's
40th anniversary dinner, which was expected to draw 700 people at
$100 each and another 40 who paid $750 as part of an effort to
raise $100,000 for New Hampshire Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Begala, a senior adviser to Clinton, said the president was
seeking to mix policy with renewal, but conceded that in large
measure this was a ``sentimental journey'' for Clinton. ``It's good
for his soul,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Clinton could not completely escape his problems back
in Washington, just a week after his Senate impeachment trial
ended.
</P>
<P>
   The state's leading newspaper, the Manchester Union Leader,
greeted his arrival with this screaming headline draped above the
masthead: ``Mr. President, you're a disgrace!''
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton's motorcade pulled up to the Municipal Center in
Dover for the health care event, some of the about 40 demonstrators
carried signs that read ``Jail to the Chief'' and ``Shame.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all of the demonstrators were hostile. A lone woman
stood in the rain by the side of the road near the Manchester
airport. Her plastic-covered sign read: ``Clinton/Gore-'92,'96,'99
-With You.''
</P>
<P>
   This was Clinton's first trip back to New Hampshire since 1996,
and he was eager to wallow in the memories, dating all the way back
to 1992.
</P>
<P>
   During a roundtable discussion on health care, he remarked, ``I
had a lot of conversations like this in 1991 and 1992 in New
Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled visiting a Nashua senior citizens center and meeting
a couple who told him they missed a lot of meals every week so they
could pay their medical bills. ``Medicare should have a
prescription drug benefit. I feel very strongly about that,'' the
president said to the applause of his audience that included health
care professionals and Democratic elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   At other points, Clinton seemed especially eager to show that
the confidence New Hampshire voters placed in his stewardship of
the government had not been in vain, despite his involvement in yet
another scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing the current debate in Washington over how to spend
the budget surplus, he said, ``That was an inconceivable dicussion
in 1991 and 1992 in New Hamsphire.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also displayed flourishes of his famed empathy, during
the health care panel. After Beth Dixon, a Concord mother of four,
told the president that her father has Alzheimer's disease and that
her parents had to sell their home and move in with her, Clinton
admonished the audience to give her a hand. ``You know, I lost an
uncle and an aunt to Alzheimer's,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He later threw his head back in laughter after telling a joke he
stole from Vice President Al Gore. After St. Peter gave clearance
for a lawyer and a media mogul to go to Heaven, he told a guy who
ran an HMO that he could come in to Heaven with no questions asked,
``But you can only stay three days.''

 &HT;    Meet-and-greet at Saks will aid cancer charities
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There's a special shopping weekend in store next fall
for style-conscious, civic-minded Atlantans. An unnamed, but major
designer will make a meet-and-greet appearance at the Phipps Plaza
Saks Fifth Avenue store the weekend of Sept. 24-26, and 2 percent
of the store's weekend sales will be donated to local and national
breast cancer charities.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the Council of Fashion Designers of America's
``Fashion Targets Breast Cancer'' campaign, all Saks stores
nationwide will participate. The CFDA is compelling designers to
fan out that weekend to help boost sales, and a number of them
(Joseph Abboud, Douglas Hannant, Jeffrey Banks, Julie Chaiken of
Chaiken &AMP; Capone and Ken Kaufman and Isaac Franco of Anne Klein)
braved a rainstorm Thursday to attend the breakfast news conference
at Saks' flagship store. ``It's worth the trouble because this is
such a good cause,'' said Chaiken, who's based in San Francisco.
``I've been planning a swing through Atlanta and some stores in
Florida anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Foot fault: While Thursday's rains inspired references to
building an ark, the featured attraction at the promotional
breakfast staged by Hush Puppies negated the need to.
</P>
<P>
   Propped next to the buffet table was one of the size 22 suede
shoes that Hush Puppies custom makes for Los Angeles Lakers center
Shaquille O'Neal. (Shaq orders his Hush Puppies from the Friedman's
shoe store in Atlanta.) As impressive as the Shaq shoe was, there
remains a style gap between the men's and women's footwear Hush
Puppies will offer next fall. The women's styles are wide-ranging
and abreast of the trends toward knee-high boots, ballet-style
flats and sport-inspired sandals. The men's styles, however, appear
limited to conservative, clunky looks that belie the Space Age
technology that makes them incredibly lightweight.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Coke floats: Blitzz, the girls' sportswear firm that's
producing the Coca-Cola Co.'s line of logoed apparel, has leaked a
few of the fall/winter looks that will debut next month at the
MAGIC convention in Las Vegas. The collection will include hooded
sweatshirts, wide-legged jeans and coveralls, tank tops, drawstring
pants and cheerleader-style sweaters. The items will be priced from
about $40 to $120, and the dominant colors are charcoal gray,
safari green, navy blue and ``clay'' red.

 &HT;    Wild child Sui looks marketable
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The main reason editors endure the catcalls,
over-crowding and seat-stealing that usually accompanies an Anna
Sui show is that each time could be the last.
</P>
<P>
   After all, two designers as adamantly opposed to ``selling out''
as Sui's always been _ Isaac Mizrahi and Todd Oldham _ saw their
ready-to-wear businesses go down in flames within the past year.
With her reputation for designing trend-bucking clothes with
limited marketability, Sui's days on 7th Avenue have long seemed
numbered.
</P>
<P>
   Numbered, maybe, but not over. With the Newport Folk
Festival-inspired collection previewed Wednesday night, Sui
succeeded in showing enough looks that people might actually be
ready to wear, which would help keep her design studio open until
Fashion Week rolls around again in September.
</P>
<P>
   Sui normally designs clothes in psychedelic color combinations,
treacherously tight silhouettes and freakish fabrics. This time,
she took her cues from documentary footage of 1965 music concerts
and shaded most of her ``Flower Child'' collection in
black-and-white.
</P>
<P>
   Her cold weather clothes were cut from nubby wools, mohair,
leathers and polar fleece. Her models stomped the runway, guitar
cases in tow, like mind-altered musicians who'd just blown into
town for the gig.
</P>
<P>
   The most marketable looks in Sui's collection included
pin-dotted, plaid or plain smock dresses with short sleeves and
hemlines that fall to the knee; sheared fur jackets; wide-wale
corduroys; and mohair sweaters.
</P>
<P>
   Some touches, like the black knee socks and chukka boots, were
in keeping with Sui's characteristic crassness. Overall, though,
what they wore above the knee should be Sui's saving grace.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Marc Bouwer: There was a front-row seat reserved for LaFace
recording artist Toni Braxton at Marc Bouwer's show Wednesday
night, but the songstress never arrived. She was wise not to attend
_ and wiser still not to walk the runway in a Bouwer design as she
did a few seasons back. Bouwer's fall/winter collection showed his
utter inability to get beyond ClingWrap style dresses for the
stiletto-heeled set.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation along the runway was that Bouwer had not only made
the mistake of hiring Donald Trump's sullen daughter Ivanka to
model his clothes, but a cast of cross-dressers as well. Most of
his jersey knit dresses cloaked the models' Adam's apples, so there
was no way to tell for sure. ``Cheap'' is the word editors often
muttered during the show, but styles like Bouwer's whip-stitched
leather dresses and skirts looked fairly expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Trump _ who looked on proudly as his teenage daughter
sashayed past him wearing a beaded gown that revealed her breasts _
rap impresario Russell Simmons and torch singer Eartha Kitt watched
the spectacle from front-row seats.

<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ Always, the joke is on the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Watched the ESPY Awards the other night. There was Ben Affleck,
Mr. Homeboy Oscar, standing on the stage in a tux, groaning about
the Curse of the Bambino and the hated Yankees. There was Samuel L.
Jackson, poking fun at Boston's $26 million contract to Jose
Offerman. Sox ridicule goes coast to coast, live and in color.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday in Florida, the joke was on the Red Sox again when the
Yankees dropped an H-Bomb on the Capital City of Red Sox Nation by
announcing that they have acquired Roger Clemens in a trade with
the Toronto Blue Jays.

   Folks in New York think this is their story. A few baseball fans
in Toronto even may think it's their story. We know better. This is
another Red Sox story. Roger Clemens to the Yankees is yet another
dagger in the hearts of masochistic, whiny Red Sox fans.
</P>
<P>
   Is there no end to the indignity of being a Boston professional
sports fan? Clemens to the Yankees is like Bobby Orr to the
Montreal Canadiens, or Larry Bird to the Lakers, or . . . (gulp)
Bill Parcells to the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens to the Yankees is almost as bad as Babe Ruth to the
Yankees. Of course, at least when the Bambino went to New York, the
Sox got some cash in exchange (too bad the owner used it to finance
his Broadway shows). Clemens yielded a pair of faceless draft picks
(the immortal Eric Glaser and Mark Fischer).
</P>
<P>
   Toronto bought the Rocket's services two years ago and now the
Blue Jays have acquired David Wells (18-4 last year, 4-0 in the
postseason), lefthanded reliever Graeme Lloyd, and infielder Homer
Bush as compensation for the five-time Cy Young winner.
</P>
<P>
   All of the above explains why Red Sox general manager Dan
Duquette gets harpooned when the Yankees make a trade with the Blue
Jays. It was the Duke, you remember, who said Clemens was in the
``twilight of his career'' when the Rocket stormed out of Boston
two years (and two Cy Youngs) ago. Now we have George Steinbrenner
giving up three ballplayers for a 36-year-old Clemens and
predicting another four or five years of greatness for the Rocket.
</P>
<P>
   Close your eyes and imagine the electricity in Olde Fenway when
Roger Clemens takes the mound for the first time in a New York
uniform. And try to picture Roger wearing pinstripes at Yankee
Stadium. Oh, and think of the potential drama of a pinstriped
Clemens starting the 1999 All-Star Game for the American League at
Fenway, playing soft toss with AL starting first baseman Mo Vaughn
of the Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   There aren't many living Sox fans who saw the Babe play in
Boston and New York. But many of us remember Sparky Lyle winning a
Cy Young Award for the Yankees after the Sox gave him away for
Danny Cater. Luis Tiant was scooped up by the Yankees after playing
the Fenway hero for most of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   It's going to be interesting to see how Clemens reacts to New
York and to postseason play. One of the reasons he was traded from
Toronto was his claim that he wanted to pitch for a contender. The
Jays accommodated him by dealing him to the defending world champs.
This means the Rocket in all likelihood will go back to the
postseason and it won't take much digging to remember that he's won
only one of nine career postseason starts. Clemens's overall
playoff/World Series numbers are not bad, but the linescore still
shows only one win in nine starts. If Cleveland meets New York in
the playoffs, the Indians should make Dave Stewart come out of
retirement _ just to beat Clemens again.
</P>
<P>
   So this will be Roger's chance to get the ring he was denied
with the 1986 Red Sox. A few players from that team (Don Baylor,
'87 Twins; Dave Henderson, '89 A's; Wade Boggs, '96 Yankees) found
redemption elsewhere and now Clemens will try to grab the
championship ring that's eluded him.
</P>
<P>
   But we have to wonder how much he means it when he says he wants
to play for a winner. Clemens could have played for a winner when
he left Boston in 1996-97, but he chose top-dollar Toronto over
contending Cleveland and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens always said his family was most important. He said he
wanted to play in a ballpark in a family-friendly environment. He
wanted to bring little Koby, Kory, Kacy, and Kody to the park and
shag flies. So now he's going to bring the kids to the Bronx every
day? Are the boys going to set up a lemonade stand in Hell's
Kitchen?
</P>
<P>
   When the Sox lost the 1986 World Series in New York's Shea
Stadium, Clemens left the building cursing New York City and its
fans. He was furious about the treatment his wife and other
players' wives got from New Yorkers. Now those are his fans.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Clemens is a Yankee. Yeesh. This is hard to believe. This
is hard to swallow. Next thing you know, Jordan Marsh will become
Macy's and the Boston Globe will be purchased by the New York
Times.

ALBERT GAGNEBIN, 90, EXECUTIVE AND CO-INVENTOR OF DUCTILE IRON  
(DW) 

</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Fla., N.J. )   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Albert P. Gagnebin, the former president and chairman of
International Nickel Co., died Sunday at the Jupiter Medical Center
in Jupiter, Fla. Gagnebin, a resident of Jupiter and of Little
Silver, N.J., was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Gagnebin joined the research division of Inco, as International
Nickel is known, after he graduated from Yale University in 1930
with a degree in metallurgy. He concentrated on research into
ferrous metals at the company's laboratory in Bayonne, N.J., where
he was co-inventor of the casting formula for ductile iron, a new
type of metal.
</P>
<P>
   Ductile iron, which was patented in 1949, is made by mixing a
small amount of magnesium ore with iron ore. It is strong, like
iron, but without iron's brittleness, which means it can be tooled
at a faster rate and readily made into products. Ductile iron
quickly became popular for agricultural machinery, automotive parts
and pipes.
</P>
<P>
   Gagnebin was put in charge of the commercial development of
ductile iron. By the end of 1950, more than 15,000 tons were being
produced in American foundries.
</P>
<P>
   He was cited by the American Foundrymen's Society and the
American Institute of Mining and Metallurgic Engineers for his role
in discovering and developing ductile iron.
</P>
<P>
   Gagnebin was named manager of the nickel sales department in
1956, and vice president four years later. In 1964, he became an
executive vice president, in charge of research, development and
sales for all of the company's metal products. A year later he was
named a director.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, Gagnebin helped guide Inco's expansion into mining
operations and markets overseas, including Japan, Indonesia and New
Caledonia. He was appointed president in 1967 and chairman in 1971.
After he retired in 1974, Gagnebin remained a company director
until 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Gagnebin is survived by his wife, Genevieve Hope of Jupiter and
Little Silver; his daughters, Anne Coffin and Joan Wicks, both of
New York, and four grandchildren.

RED SOX BRACED FOR THE INEVITABLE

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ They were braced to answer questions about Mo
Vaughn leaving. But now this: Roger Clemens a Yankee?
</P>
<P>
   ``Might as well pack my stuff and go home, the season's over,''
said Jeff Frye, putting a gallows-humor spin on the news that the
Yankees, who won a record 125 games last season (including the
postseason), now have Clemens, too.
</P>
<P>
   When reporters walked into the team's clubhouse here with word
that Toronto had traded the five-time Cy Young Award winner to the
Yankees, several players thought it was a joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that true?'' catcher Scott Hatteberg said. ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Assured that it was indeed the case, pitcher Derek Lowe shook
his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's unbelievable,'' he said. ``(George) Steinbrenner
doesn't mess around, does he?''
</P>
<P>
   Frye jerked around when he heard that the Financial News Network
was among the first to report the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``What, did the market go up 300 points?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe that really happened. The Yankees are trying
to corner the market. We're already the underdogs, I guess, so
there's nothing we can do about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got too many stars. All I know is, I'm 6 for 9 off
Clemens, so I'm kind of happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Wakefield barked an expletive when he heard of the deal. He
joined in on the mock ``season-is-over'' theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know,'' he said, ``is I don't have to hit against him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox' top two pitchers, Bret Saberhagen and Pedro Martinez,
were not around to weigh in on the blockbuster. Saberhagen took the
day off from Camp Kerrigan, while Martinez has yet to arrive.
Saturday is the official reporting date for pitchers and catchers.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Pesky, long a Clemens admirer, sputtered angrily about
the deal. ``I just don't understand him,'' he said. ``He said he
wanted to be with a contender, and the Blue Jays have a good
ballclub.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is, I hope the Yankees win just 89 games.''
</P>
<P>
   One player, who did not want his name attached, offered one
possibility that might encourage Sox fans. ``Hey, he might win just
10 games for them,'' he said. ``We saw him do that here, didn't
we?''

ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE IS THIS MAN'S FORTE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GRIFFITH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Mercedes-Benz first offered 24-hour roadside assistance as
``standard equipment'' on its vehicles more than a decade ago, the
general reaction was, ``Sure, but who's going to make those road
calls on a nice summer Sunday afternoon or, even worse, at 2 a.m.
on a snowy winter's night.''
</P>
<P>
   Say hello to Tom Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he got an award from Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   It was a jacket, a distinctive leather jacket you can't buy.
</P>
<P>
   That jacket signified that he had answered every roadside
assistance call over a four-year period. Four years. 1461 days and
nights (including a Leap Year).
</P>
<P>
   He wears the jacket proudly because he earned it the hard way.
</P>
<P>
   He was called away from New Hampshire International Speedway,
where he was working as part of a racing team. He was called on
Christmas Eve . . . three times. He misses supper at home a couple
of times a week.
</P>
<P>
   Bad enough if that were his main job, but it's not: he's shop
foreman at Dreher Holloway Mercedes in Exeter, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roadside assistance was part of the Mercedes-Benz program,''
said Bacon. ``And they needed someone to cover it.''
</P>
<P>
   Which he's done . . . and done.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Paul Holloway, Bacon's boss, also has been chairman of the
National Automobile Dealers Assn. for the past year.
</P>
<P>
   He recently spent an evening with the New England Motor Press
Assn., sharing a dealer's view on his industry. He talked frankly
about how the internet is affecting sales, about the overcapacity
for production that's plaguing the industry, the impending mergers
of automakers, and the trend to bigger and more factory-dealer
partnerships . . . but in the end it came down to why employees
like Tom Bacon are so important.
</P>
<P>
   ``Programs such as guaranteed roadside assistance are called a
promise of the brand,'' said Holloway.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they're (programs) only as strong as the smallest
independent dealer of that brand,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, Holloway cites an industry problem _ the plight
of the small dealerships that have been targeted by the
manufacturer as ``not viable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They've basically put that dealer in limbo. He can't afford to
retire, and he can't sell his franchise because the banks won't
lend to a buyer if the manufacturer doesn't consider the business
viable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think that dealer is going to have someone available
for roadside assistance 24 hours a day?'' Holloway asked, then
answered his own question. ``I don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``So when a customer breaks down in his area and doesn't get the
assistance, what does he do? He tells everyone he knows that the
system is a crock, and those negative feelings cost you customers
you're never going to regain.''
</P>
<P>
   To Holloway, the Mercedes roadside program has been the most
successful one of its kind in the industry because it's run by
Mercedes and not subcontracted.
</P>
<P>
   So there's little wonder why Mercedes was as proud to present
Mr. Bacon with that jacket as he was to receive it.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly dealerships have come a long way since the horse 'n
buggy days.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But, according to Holloway, those horse 'n buggy days still have
a major impact on how we in the Northeast buy our cars and have
them serviced.
</P>
<P>
   Before the automobile, every neighborhood had a stable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Around here, those stables all became garages, then
dealerships,'' said Holloway.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result some areas of the country _ notably the Northeast
_ are overdealered.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example, he noted that the Boston advertising ADI (area of
dominant interest) has more than 40 Pontiac dealerships while the
Greater Dallas area has four.
</P>
<P>
   What does it mean?
</P>
<P>
   For one thing that newspapers are filled with auto ads by
dealers bashing each others' bumpers over a $50 difference in
price.
</P>
<P>
   And, for another, that the dealer isn't going to make a whole
lot of profit selling you a new car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nationally, dealers made 1.4 percent profit on $508 billion in
car sales in 1997'' That's $200-$300 per car, hardly enough to keep
a dealership rolling.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So how do dealerships survive?
</P>
<P>
   ``They adapt . . . or they're gone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (auto dealership) is a service industry. It's about
building relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   He should know. He's been a successful dealer for more than 30
years, starting with the acquisition of Dreher Buick in 1967 and
now holding Buick, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Chevrolet, Chevy Truck,
Mercedes-Benz and BMW franchises.
</P>
<P>
   ``It starts with the new car sale. Then, you work like hell to
service it (new car).
</P>
<P>
   ``With luck, you'll sell a used car to one of the family's
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, if you've treated the family well over this time,
hopefully they've been telling their friends, neighbors, family and
coworkers and sending you referrals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the value of a customer over a lifetime. It's what
this business is about now.''
</P>
<P>
   It includes millions invested in equipment and people.
</P>
<P>
   For his service department, he exclusively and aggressively
recruits people with AA degrees from Voc Tech colleges.
``Outstanding technicians are worth their weight in gold,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the president of the NADA mentions his man Tom
Bacon in speeches all across the country.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Behind Garage Door No. 1: a 1999 Hyundai Sonata GLS. Price tag
roughly $18,000, plus delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Behind Garage Door No. 2: a 1999 Audi 8 Quattro. Price tag
roughly $75,000.
</P>
<P>
   I was standing in the driveway and reluctant to choose either
door . . . for very different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai's reputation, shall we say, has preceded it. I can
remember the times I've turned onto a highway on-ramp, all set to
hit the gas and get up to a reasonable merging-into-traffic speed
only to see an Excel, spewing black smoke and struggling to make
headway.
</P>
<P>
   The gleaming Audi, on the other hand, with more bells and
whistles than an Inspector Gadget nightmare and its stated ambition
to bring the luxury automobile to a higher level, seemed far too
valuable to be driven on a mere roadway.
</P>
<P>
   Colleague John White solved the dilemma. His driving report on
the Audi appeared last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   So it was ``Hello, Mr. Hyundai.''
</P>
<P>
   A quick walk-around fortunately showed no family resemblance
between this restyled-for-'99 Sonata and its forebears.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the walk showed a nicely styled mid-sized family sedan
that is happy to present a new and distinctive face to the world it
hopes to conquer _ a pug-nose of a grille and amoeba-shaped
headlights.
</P>
<P>
   A price tag of just under $20,000 will get you a fully appointed
Sonata _ 2.5-liter V6, automatic transmission, air conditioning,
cruise control, leather, power moonroof, ABS, 120-watt sound system
with CD player. Our tested version came in right about $18,000,
minus the leather, ABS or moonroof. That's not cheap, until you
compare it to the competition: the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, and
Mitsubishi Galant.
</P>
<P>
   Venturing further, actually inserting key into driver's door,
the power locks opened and a surprisingly roomy interior was
revealed.
</P>
<P>
   If you get the idea I wasn't in an all-fired rush to take off
into Friday afternoon traffic, you're right.
</P>
<P>
   So we sat awhile, looking.
</P>
<P>
   Usually a few controls in an unfamiliar car will bring forth a
``Whuzzthatdo?'' but not this time.
</P>
<P>
   The Hyundai was designed intuitively. Controls were clearly
marked and where they should be. The heater buttons didn't appear
to be the sturdiest, but worked fine.
</P>
<P>
   I tried the back seat _ plenty of space for two adults of any
size. This clearly is shaping up as a reasonably-priced family
sedan.
</P>
<P>
   Still procrastinating, I grabbed the owner's manual, determined
to find a ``nugget'' to share with anyone still waiting for me to
take this car on the road.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, it was in the introduction, and we quote:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hyundai realizes that success in the American marketplace can
only be achieved by total commitment to customer satisfaction.
Consistent with this understanding Hyundai is endeavoring to insure
that its products receive the best public acceptance of any product
in automotive history.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai didn't get to be multinational manufacturing success by
building junk . . . even though their early American-market cars
are now mostly just that. And they recognized that the likes of me
weren't going to be eager to jump on their bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   And they're backing up those words.
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai is standing behind the Sonata with an unsurpassed _
especially for this segment of the market _ five-year, 60,000-mile
bumper-to-bumper warranty. All Hyundais now feature an eye-opening
drivetrain warranty of 10 years or 100,000 miles and body panel
rust-through warranty for 5 years or 100,000 miles. Plus, Hyundai
is offering a five-year roadside assistance plan, including towing
and lockout service.
</P>
<P>
   That's got to be an irresistible deal for those folks who live
their lives according to the dictums of financial gurus who buy a
car with the idea of driving it for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Now that we know we can be driving this car in 10 years, it's
time to turn the key and hit the road.
</P>
<P>
   And, guess what, just like that dreaded speech or trip to the
doctor, the anticipation was far worse than the reality.
</P>
<P>
   The V6 had plenty of zip and we had not a whit of difficulty
zipping around Morrissey Boulevard and up the ramp onto Route 93
northbound, melding smoothly with the inbound traffic towards
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   For once, the congestion isn't bad (everyone must be still
recovering from what the traffic reports had made out as a
certified ``worst day ever'' of a morning commute).
</P>
<P>
   The car warms up extremely quickly (a big plus in my book) and
the heater and defroster quickly melt what is left of my reluctance
to be on my way.
</P>
<P>
   This obviously isn't your father's Excel. All the
``mechanicals'' work just fine and the front-wheel drive proves
just fine in this winter's minor snows.
</P>
<P>
   A few nits to pick: The gear selector likes to slide past drive
to third when you engage the transmission and the seat belt warning
chimes are particularly annoying.
</P>
<P>
   Our 23.9 miles per gallon on a test tank falls right in the EPA
range of 20-29 mpg. Tip: Don't try to top off this tank. When the
gas nozzle clicks off, it's full.
</P>
<P>
   All of which brings us back to the lingering question: How far
will this Hyundai go and how reliable will it be?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe far enough and dependably enough to make Door 1 a good
choice. After all, Hyundai is willing to guarantee it.

COMMENTARY: YANKS INVADE JAPAN! 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   March 1, 2000 _ For the second time in the past century, the
United States today occupied Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. landing force was led by the newly designated secretary
of defense, Robert Rubin, and the newly designated chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Lawrence Summers. The U.S. force
immediately seized control of the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of
Finance.
</P>
<P>
   The invasion came 30 days after America's trade deficit
ballooned to an all-time monthly high of $35 billion. In the wake
of the enormous U.S. deficit, the financier George Soros triggered
a 25 percent drop in the value of the dollar by selling huge
amounts of dollars and buying the new European currency, the euro.
As investors followed Soros out of the dollar, they also dumped
their U.S. Treasury bonds, sending U.S. interest rates up to 12
percent, overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it,'' one hedge fund manager said, ``with the
Japanese refusing to spend any money, American consumers for the
last two years have been the only ones in the world buying up
everyone else's exports. Everyone was dumping their goods on
America, and American workers were being put out of their jobs left
and right. It was OK as long as the soaring stock market made
Americans feel rich, but after Amazon.com crashed, and took down
the whole stock market, Americans just couldn't go on being the
world's buyers of last resort. The Americans had to invade Japan to
force them to start spending some of their savings, and to start
importing.''
</P>
<P>
   This explains why the first thing U.S. troops did after breaking
into the Bank of Japan was to begin passing out yen on the streets
of Japan's major cities. American B-52s also carpet-bombed Japan
with Visa cards.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon spokesman said the occupation, dubbed ``Operation
Make Them Spend,'' would continue until Japan had increased its
imports from the rest of Asia by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. troops went house to house, forcing Japanese to take the
yen out of their mattresses and spend it within 48 hours. People
caught hoarding cash after 48 hours were told their money would be
handed over to someone who could spend it properly.
</P>
<P>
   Those Japanese who refused to spend were rounded up and taken to
re-education camps: Japanese age 50 and over were taken to schools
run by the Home Shopping Network, where they were taught how to
make purchases from TV, while Japanese under 50 were taken to
Amazon.com school, where they were taught how to make purchases
over the Internet and outfitted with AOL accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Summers, a former Harvard economist, was personally handling the
re-education of Japan's Vice Minister of Finance, Eisuke
Sakakibara, in a back room of the U.S. Embassy. According to
rumors, Sakakibara was being made to read aloud from the works of
Milton Friedman, nonstop, with his eyelids taped open. Horrible
screams were heard coming from Sakakibara's cell.
</P>
<P>
   Summers said, ``My predecessor, Douglas MacArthur, transformed
Japan from a dictatorship to a democracy, and I will transform
Japan from a producer-driven society to a consumer-driven society.
MacArthur said `Charge'; I say `Charge it.'''
</P>
<P>
   China denounced the invasion, calling it U.S. ``aggression,''
and insisted that it cease immediately _ unless 25 percent of the
yen being spent by Japanese was on Chinese-made goods, in which
case Beijing said the operation would be ``a contribution to the
harmony and stability of Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   The commander of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Brig. Gen.
Charlene Barshefsky, was splitting her time between Narita airport
and Tokyo's main port of Yokohama, where her team of engineers was
systematically blowing up Japan's trade barriers and arresting
Japanese customs officials. Ms. Barshefsky told reporters, ``Let
this be a warning to the Europeans, if they continue to refuse to
buy our bananas.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Ms. Barshefsky, who in her previous job as America's
top trade negotiator had often angered the State Department by her
tough negotiating with U.S. allies, was the only casualty of the
operation. She was shot in the back and wounded by friendly fire
from the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo. The State Department spokesman,
James Rubin, described the incident as ``an unfortunate accident.''

AID FLOWING INTO JORDAN

 By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A strong and somewhat unexpected show of support
from Jordan's neighbors is helping King Abdullah's new regime gain
its financial footing.
</P>
<P>
   Assurances of long-term backing had already been provided by the
Clinton administration, with a proposed $300 million three-year aid
increase on top of an earlier $225 million pledge this year, and
the International Monetary Fund, with a new contingency loan
package for approximately $150 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   But in this vulnerable period of mourning and transition, Jordan
has also received promises of financial support from Saudi Arabia
and Israel and pledges of continued trade ties from Syria and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanians remain concerned about prospects for growth in the
stagnant local economy, which has suffered for a decade from a
drastic contraction of trade with Iraq and the loss of critical
income from expatriate workers who returned from Kuwait and Saudi
Arabia during the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Jordan's role in the region is to continue and develop, all
promises have to be translated into tangible financial facts,'' Al
Rai, a leading newspaper, said in an editorial Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jordan's allies and business partners breathed easier as
financial markets reopened a week after King Hussein's death and
showed no signs of succumbing to feared speculative attack.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to last summer, when initial reports of Hussein's
illness sent an estimated $400 million fleeing offshore, there were
no reports of significant capital flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, irrational behavior caused by shock was
short-lived,'' Fahed Fanek, a local financial commentator, wrote in
The Jordan Times. Domestic financial fallout from the king's death
was limited, he said, ``because the fundamentals are right, the
institutions are there, functioning properly, and the world is
supporting us in every way.''
</P>
<P>
   Amman's banks and stock market and currency traders opened their
doors on Saturday after an official week of mourning for Hussein,
who died on Feb. 7 and was succeeded by his eldest son, Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   As local markets closed Thursday for the Muslim weekend, the
Jordanian dinar was little changed from the levels of a month ago,
when Hussein was expected to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Promised support from Jordan's neighbors _ most notably from
Persian Gulf leaders, who had cut off support to Hussein _ put
traders on notice that any run on the dinar would meet stiff
resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwait, meanwhile, announced plans to reopen its embassy and
restore oil sales and economic aid halted after Jordan's tilt to
Iraq in the 1991 gulf conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, Saudi Arabia _ where the royal family is
a historic rival of Jordan's Hashemite dynasty _ also said it would
resume financial aid and oil shipments suspended since the Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saudi Arabia will firmly stand by you and support you in good
and bad times and will use its resources to help Jordan,'' Crown
Prince Abdullah Ben Abdul Aziz of Saudi Arabia said in a message to
King Abdullah on his return from King Hussein's funeral, Jordan's
government news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, much criticized in Amman for its perceived failure to
increase trade and investment after its 1994 peace treaty with
Jordan, also advertised its willingness to put its money on the
line. The Israeli government has discussed lending Jordan up to
$200 million to defend the dinar, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economic stability of our Jordanian neighbors is as
important as stability in terms of security,'' Dan Proper, head of
Israel's leading manufacturers association, said, calling for
increased private investment in Jordan.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Yet while the dinar may remain stable, there are few job
opportunities for a work force that has been growing by 5 percent
yearly for a decade, and few obvious short-term prospects for swift
growth in trade or investment.
</P>
<P>
   For the past decade, as a stagnant economy failed to keep pace
with 3.7 percent population growth, Jordan's per capita income has
hovered around $1,500. Efforts to use low wages as an enticement
for export manufacturers have generated few concrete results, but
considerable resentment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still see the economic outlook as gloomy,'' said Laith
Shabeilat, a Jordanian opposition leader. ``I don't want us to end
up as an economic colony of the United States and Israel, enslaved
as cheap labor.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's most acute problem remains its dependence on trade with
Iraq. Economic sanctions and low oil prices are expected to cut
exports to Iraq to $190 million this year, less than half the level
of a decade ago _ a ``devastating blow'' to Jordan's hopes for
recovery, said Marwan Khirfan of the Amman Chamber of Industry.
</P>
<P>
   Geopolitics has not been kind to Jordan's economy. Jordan
remains what it was since King Hussein was crowned in 1952: a
small, resource-poor buffer state separating muscular and volatile
neighbors. Except now it is even smaller, with fewer resources.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan never recovered from its swift, thorough defeat in the
1967 war with Israel. It lost the fertile West Bank of the Jordan
River, once the source of 60 percent of its produce and significant
export income.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the West Bank was home to an industrious,
educated business community. After 1967, Jordan lost their skills,
and their capital.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli enmity and border security ensured that Jordanian
companies lost access to what was once a third of their local
market. Jordanian goods were displaced by Israeli products in West
Bank shops, and dinars gave way to shekels.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's violent expulsion of Palestine Liberation Organization
troops in 1970 and the Israeli security clampdown of the late 1980s
further estranged Jordan from its former territory. Jordan now
exports barely $20 million yearly to the West Bank, compared with
estimated Israeli sales of nearly $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of the West Bank heightened Jordan's dependence on
income from the Persian Gulf, which was slashed when Jordan sided
with Iraq in the Gulf War. Kuwait and Saudi Arabia angrily stopped
cut-rate oil shipments and forced some 300,000 resident Jordanians
to return home.
</P>
<P>
   But Jordan's 1994 decision to make peace with Israel won it some
Western support. The treaty was rewarded with the elimination of
$683 million in U.S. government debt, as well as reprieves from $92
million owed to Britain, $65 million in French state debt, and $53
million from Germany. Japan provided $215 million in cheap new
loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jordan has benefited from more donor support than any other
country of its size and income level, on a per capita basis,'' the
World Bank noted in its 1998 annual report. Yet, as the bank added,
``Most support has been invisible to the general public, in the
form of debt reschedulings, conversions, and write-offs.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Jordan's total foreign debt approaching $8 billion,
its leaders are seeking further forgiveness from Western creditors.
Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh told Parliament on Wednesday that
debt servicing would cost Jordan $812 million this year, consuming
28 percent of the budget and 9 percent of the country's total
income.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is pushing for a long-term
rescheduling of Jordan's government-to-government debt, tied to the
renewal of an International Monetary Fund loan program that
concludes this month.

<P>
   The Western democracies, sometimes separately, sometimes
together, are working out a historic policy: Reward selected
terrorist nations for their crimes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The policy is not a conspiracy but grows out of national
interests and attitudes, open or denied, as now perceived in
Western capitals.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Each government either thinks reward of perpetrators is now
economic wisdom for itself, or fears terrorist retaliation, or is
enticed by the political benefits of making the public believe the
file is closed.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The people and officials of these nations drift warmly into the
last sleep _ moral equivalency. Look, lots of other unpleasant
countries are around, and anyway we are not so great. What's the
difference between Americans bombing a factory in Sudan and
terrorists blowing up a building in New York?
</P>
<P>
   Here are just four cases in the new reward policy.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest is Pan Am 103, which for 10 years has stirred in its
grave in Scotland. For years, Western and Mideast intelligence
agencies said specialists from terrorist camps in Syria had
blueprinted destruction of the plane and its victims _ 270.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They said the money had come from Iran and that Libyans were
brought in when German police were closing in on Syria's
operators. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then a new theory popped up _ a couple of Libyans did it all by
themselves. Col. Muammar Gadhafi refused to give them up.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now again we dig up the idea about Scottish judges trying them
in the Netherlands. Gadhafi is likely to accept it, after
bargaining the U.S. said it would never get into. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This time it is a rose of the desert for him. He gets embargoes
against the sale of oil lifted as soon as the two are turned in.
The wording makes it virtually impossible to restore the embargo,
even if the defendants sacrifice the lives of every relative in
Libya by fingering the colonel.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They are not likely to be asked. The U.S.-U.K. proposals forbid
``undermining'' the Libyan government at the trial! An affirmative
vote of nine out of the 15 U.N. Security Council members would be
needed to reinstate the embargo _ and the five permanent members
forswear use of the veto against reinstatement! &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gadhafi gets billions in oil money. Favorite Western countries
get Libyan contracts. Relatives of the Pan Am dead get to cry
forever. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Iraq _ that one. We know Saddam Hussein is nearing possession of
weapons of mass slaughter. After the gulf war, the U.N. inspection
team tried to track down his weaponry, and got close. Some of our
best friends double-crossed the inspection team to death last year.
That's real power. Now they fight to lift the oil embargo against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   If wan Washington keeps opposing lifting the embargo, and the
new weaponry Iraq would get, others will scornfully lift it for
themselves. What's the difference between U.S. unilateral action
against Saddam, and European unilateral action against America?
Matter of viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   China _ all right, the Communists broke their promises to
President Clinton about improving human rights. But who said he was
dumb enough to believe them? Just because he said so?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The way to stop China from stealing U.S. military know-how is to
sell some to Beijing. If China is cracking down harder on religious
and political rights _ who made us the world's superchaplain?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mexico. We know it is the funnel for about 70 percent of the
heroin and cocaine entering the U.S. America has sanctions passed
by Congress to stop that kind of thing.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Mexicans are touchy. If we use the waiting sanctions, or
speak sharply, they may get mean and hurt. Maybe parents of
American kids who stick the stuff in their noses and veins might
march outside the Mexican Embassy with signs saying ``Touchy, Mean
and Hurt'' _ and see who cares.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But if Clinton just says Mexico is doing the best it can,
sanctions can be skipped. So lie, man, lie.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We know how to end rewarding perpetrator nations. In an
investigation of its operation in Indonesia, the World Bank, headed
by James Wolfensohn, said its own officials ignored corruption,
growing repression and a collapsing financial system during the
final years of President Suharto's 33-year rule.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Remember? It is called telling the bloody truth.  &QL;

GILLETTE CHIEF WHO BOOSTED COMPANY TO RETIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Alfred M. Zeien, who helped launch the Mach3 razor and
brought about the acquisition of the Duracell battery company,
plans to retire April 15 as chairman and chief executive of
Gillette Co.
</P>
<P>
   Zeien, who will remain on Gillette's board of directors after
eight years at the company's top job, will be succeeded by Gillette
president Michael C. Hawley, 61, a move long expected.
</P>
<P>
   When Hawley begins his new duties, his position of president
will be temporarily left open, Gillette said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a carefully planned-out transition,'' said Zeien, who
added later: ``I'm a believer in term limits.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the (stock) market will have any major reaction
to this,'' said Schroder &AMP; Co. analyst Andrew McQuilling. ``There
will be no change in strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   While not unexpected _ Zeien is 68 and several times has delayed
his retirement after Gillette's board of directors promised him big
incentive packages to stay on _ the move comes after a challenging
year for Gillette after nearly a decade of triumphs.
</P>
<P>
   Turbulence in overseas markets slowed the company's normally
rapid growth in 1998, and in the fall, Gillette announced plans to
streamline its work force, partly through layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Mach3 has sold impressively in the United States
since its launch last summer, Gillette's revenues were essentially
flat in 1998, at just over $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Profits, meanwhile, declined from $1.43 billion in 1997 to $1.08
billion in 1998. In its third quarter last year, Gillette recorded
its first quarterly profit drop in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Gillette remains strong. In 1997, it was the most
profitable publicly traded company in Massachusetts, and those 1997
profits about equaled those of Raytheon Co., EMC Corp., and State
Street Corp. put together.
</P>
<P>
   Of Gillette's problems last fall, Zeien referred to them
Thursday as a mere ``blip.'' The company is once again regaining
momentum and should return to its old clip in the second half of
1999, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zeien, who joined Gillette in 1968, came to the job in 1991
after the sudden death of previous chief executive Colman M.
Mockler Jr.
</P>
<P>
   During his eight years at the top, Zeien saw annual sales grow
from just over $4.3 billion to just over $10 billion. When he
became chief executive, Wall Street placed a market value on
Gillette of about $6 billion; now it's $63 billion, Zeien said.
</P>
<P>
   Razors tend to run in seven- to eight-year product cycles, so
with last year's successful launch of Mach3, a triple-blade razor
for men, the timing was right to retire, Zeien said.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor figured into the timing of Zeien's decision.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Gillette acquired Duracell and added batteries to its
portfolio of consumer products.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, batteries and razors don't seem to be a neat
match, but both can use the same distribution channels, and
Gillette believed the same ``trading-up'' strategy that had worked
so well for its razors could be applied to batteries.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics often scoff that razors are such a mundane item as to
be nothing more than a commodity. But again and again, Gillette has
convinced consumers that it has so improved the razor that they
should be willing to spend more for each shave.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the case with each succeeding generation of razors,
from the Blue Blade, to the Sensor, and now to the Mach3.
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, consumers began to see that same strategy
applied to Duracell, with the Duracell Ultra segmenting the battery
market by providing it with a premium category.
</P>
<P>
   With the integration of Duracell now complete, Zeien felt it was
a good time to hand the reins to Hawley.
</P>
<P>
   After 36 years at Gillette, Hawley, a Boston College graduate,
is one of the company's most experienced global managers, having
lived on five continents. Given that only 37 percent of Gillette's
1997 revenues came from the United States, Hawley's globe-trotting
resume should stand him in good stead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should be a natural fit,'' said S&AMP;P Equity Group analyst
Robert Izmirlian.
</P>
<P>
   Each year Gillette introduces about 20 new products, and one
obvious job for Hawley is to to extend Mach3's shaving technology
into products for women.
</P>
<P>
   Hawley was appointed Gillette president in 1995 after that
position had gone unfilled for the prior four years.
</P>
<P>
   Given Gillette's methodical approach, most analysts would be
surprised if the company's next president doesn't ultimately come
from the ranks of its four executive vice presidents.
</P>
<P>
   The four are Edward F. DeGraan, who's responsible for Gillette's
grooming products and Duracell batteries; Robert G. King, who
oversees commercial operations for the Western Hemisphere; Archie
Livis, who supervises such divisions as Braun and Oral-B; and
Jorgen Wedel, in charge of commercial operations for the Eastern
Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette announced Zeien's retirement after the markets closed.
On the New York Stock Exchange, its shares were down 13/16 to close
at 55 11/16.

A SYMBOLIC VISIT TO THE STATE THAT RE-LAUNCHED THE `COMEBACK KID' 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Seven years ago, the voters of New Hampshire
threw Bill Clinton a lifeline when it looked as if he were sinking
for the third time under the weight of disclosures about his draft
record and his private life.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, President Clinton returned to thank the people of
New Hampshire for their indulgence, spending a day here discussing
health care, greeting old friends and raising money for the state
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit Thursday to Dover, Merrimack and Manchester was
his first domestic trip out of Washington since his acquittal by
the Senate last Friday on two articles of impeachment charging him
with perjury and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the Gennifer Flowers affair that almost doomed
his candidacy in 1992 was just a tantalizing preview of the vastly
more damaging Monica Lewinsky scandal that consumed the sixth year
of Clinton's presidency and has permanently altered his place in
history.
</P>
<P>
   The president was not gloating Thursday, not exactly. But the
symbolism of the trip was unmistakable. It was here in the early
days of the 1992 campaign that Clinton earned the nickname the
Comeback Kid, a clever bit of spin by his handlers after he
survived the sex and draft disclosures to finish a strong second in
the New Hampshire primary seven years ago Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said then that his second-place finish, to former Sen.
Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, ``proved I can take a punch.''
That was nothing, Clinton's appearance on Thursday said. Over the
past year, he has taken everything the Supreme Court, an
independent counsel and the Congress could throw at him and he is
still standing and talking about how he intends to spend his last
two years in office.
</P>
<P>
   In Dover on Thursday morning, Clinton presided over a discussion
of his proposals to expand health-care programs to cover part of
the cost of nursing home care, extend health benefits to more
children and expand the rights of subscribers to health maintenance
organizations. He lingered after the event, shaking hands and
embracing nearly all of the 250 people who sat through the
discussion at the Dover town hall. It was a friendly crowd, a
handpicked group of loyalists who remembered Clinton's words seven
years ago, ``I'll never forget who gave me a second chance, and
I'll be there for you until the last dog dies.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter B. Schmidt, 60, a retired professor of German at the
University of New Hampshire, said he was eager to see the president
return to matters of substance after a year in which he, as Schmidt
delicately phrased it, ``suffered some distractions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has paid a price, damn right he has,'' Schmidt continued.
``The idea that he `got away with it' is rubbish. Clearly he has
been harmed and his legacy has been tarnished.''
</P>
<P>
   But Schmidt echoed the findings of many polls that the public
can separate Clinton's private behavior from his performance in
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people decided wisely that they were not electing
a pope, a minister or a moral icon. They have elected a man who has
a good handle on the problems of the country,'' Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   Others were not as forgiving. The Union Leader newspaper of
Manchester carried a banner headline reading, `` Mr. President,
you're a disgrace!'' and published a front-page editorial telling
Clinton he was not welcome in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The editorial, signed by the paper's publisher, Nackey Loeb, was
titled, ``Don't come back, kid'' and said that once upon a time a
presidential visit to New Hampshire was a special occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when it was purely political, it was something special
just to have the president of our country in our midst,'' the
editorial said. ``Not anymore. Not today. Not with this man.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the president's spokesman, shrugged it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the First Amendment is great,'' Lockhart said, ``and
should be protected at all costs.''

LAWRENCE O'DONNELL, 70; WAS OFFICER WITH CIA, AEC 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lawrence Francis O'Donnell, a Central Intelligence Agency
operative in Europe and a foreign affairs officer with the US
Atomic Energy Commission, died Jan. 30 in San Diego. He was 70.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. O'Donnell, a Taunton, Mass. native, graduated from Harvard
College in 1949. After serving in the Operations Research Office of
the Army, where he worked to counter enemy psychological warfare
efforts during the Korean War, he was an official with the CIA in
Eastern Europe from 1951 to 1956. He then was a senior foreign
affairs officer in Western Europe for the Atomic Energy Commission
from 1956 to 1972.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, he moved his family from McLean, Va., to LaJolla,
Calif., and was director of advance planning and director of public
affairs for General Atomic Co. After leaving General Atomic in
1982, he was a consultant on public policy issues in the energy
field.
</P>
<P>
   He was appointed to the Western Interstate Energy Board by
President Ronald Reagan in 1983. He served on the board until 1991.
From 1985 to 1991, he was chairman of the California Council for
Environmental and Economic Balance.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. O'Donnell was president of Senior Policy Associates and
Public Policy Focus and volunteered his efforts with the Committee
to Support the Democracy Movement in Czechoslovakia. He attended
the inauguration of Vaclav Havel as president of the Czech and
Slovak Federal Republic in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   In his retirement, Mr. O'Donnell lived in Baja California,
Mexico, where he and his wife were instrumental in the work of the
Friends of the Poor, a charitable organization that provides
medical supplies and other goods and services to the indigent
people of the Baja Region.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, Isabel (Fulton); three sons, Lawrence Jr.
and James, both of California, and Patrick of Ascot, England; three
daughters, Theresa, Kate, and Deirdre, all of California; a
brother, Thomas L.P. of Hingham; Mass.; and eight grandchildren.

MICROSOFT'S `BIGGEST CUSTOMER' COMES TO VISIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ Bill Gates Thursday welcomed ``our biggest
customer in the world'' _ the Defense Department _ to the Microsoft
campus, in the person of William Cohen, Secretary of Defense.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen had just come from the F-22 line at the Boeing
Developmental Center in south Seattle, where workers are assembling
fighter-jet wings from cast titanium and molded fiber. Such a tour
is typical for a Secretary of Defense. But meeting with Microsoft
workers was something unusual _ a pulpit in software country, a
chance to tell an un-military audience that their interests and his
are, in his view, much alike.
</P>
<P>
   The prosperity of Microsoft and other U.S. companies, he said,
was made possible by security created by strong U.S. military
forces, ``forward-deployed.'' Whether it was air patrols over Iraq
and Bosnia or the bunkers on the outskirts of Seoul, Cohen said, it
is U.S. soldiers who maintain the stability and predictability
crucial for business.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen decried the view common in technology circles that
government is an anachronism. He quoted an unidentified Silicon
Valley executive from April 18, 1998, in the New York Times: ``I
don't even care about Washington,'' the executive said. ``Money is
extracted from Silicon Valley and then wasted by Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   More money for weapons is one of the things Cohen wants from
Congress. He told the Microsoft employees American soldiers need
up-to-date equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The military is also having problems attracting and retaining
people in the midst of an economic boom. Cohen said military pay
and pensions need to be increased, with larger increases targeted
to people with key skills.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Microsoft is part of a program by the computer industry
and the Department of Labor to recruit departing military people.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said Congress needs to approve two more rounds of base
closures. The four rounds so far, he said, would soon be saving the
government $5.6 billion per year, and two more rounds would add $3
billion a year to that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should take the money and put it into procurement,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gates expressed a worry about security threats to the nation's
``digital nervous system,'' and mentioned that ``a lot of dialog
has been going on behind the scenes.'' That was one of the things
he talked to Cohen about in private, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen also referred to ``cyberterrorism.'' He said, ``We don't
have the answer at the Department of Defense. We need to work with
the private sector.''

ELIOT J. COHEN, AIDS VICTIM ADMIRED FOR HIS COURAGE; AT 16 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eliot wanted to be a paramedic when he grew up. Eliot wanted to
be the fastest, safest ambulance driver in the world . . . because
all the ambulances he rode in seemed so slow. Eliot wanted to get
married and have children. But most of all, Eliot wanted to be
normal. AIDS deprived Eliot of all these dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Eliot J. Cohen, ninth-grade homecoming king of Sharon High
School, died Wednesday in his home in Sharon, Mass. He was 16.
</P>
<P>
   As a premature newborn at Children's Hospital in Boston, Eliot
received a blood transfusion. That was in 1982, when AIDS was still
relatively unknown. It wasn't until he was in the third grade and
contracted pneumonia that doctors diagnosed his disease.
</P>
<P>
   Frightened by the example of Ryan White and other children
around the nation who had been ostracized after disclosing they had
the disease, the Cohen family _ Eliot, his mother, Laurie, and his
father, Robert _ kept the secret to themselves for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Then Eliot read about Max Warburg, a Boston boy whose determined
fight against leukemia inspired the Max Warburg Courage curriculum
in Boston middle schools.
</P>
<P>
   Eliot decided to tell his fifth grade class his secret. His
parents worried about him, but his peers at Cottage Street
Elementary School greeted him with open arms and even helped raise
money for pediatric AIDS research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids lead with their hearts and these kids here have always
led with theirs,'' Laurie Cohen said in a story published in the
Globe on June 7, 1998. ``One of the gifts of this disease _ and
there are a lot of horrors _ is seeing how kind and compassionate
this community has been.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the horrors of the disease visited Eliot in 1997, when he
suffered a stroke that affected the left side of his body and
impaired his speech, vision, and memory. He used a wheelchair or
cane to get around, but retained his impish grin and mischievous
sense of humor as he held court at the table reserved for him in
the Sharon High cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   His favorite restaurant was Anthony's Pier Four. His favorite
actor was Jack Nicholson. His favorite movie was ``Starship
Troopers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My dream is to live a normal life. I hope to get married and
have children,'' he said last year. ``I want to be a paramedic
because I want to know that I personally saved lives. I want to be
the best, fastest, and safest ambulance driver, because all the
ambulances I was in moved much too slow. My hopes and dreams aren't
to be extraordinary, but just to be ordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his parents, Robert J. and Laurie Hope (Mead) Cohen;
and his grandparents, Martin and Lillian (Bluestein) Mead of
Newton, Mass.

Carnival Place, paid less than 1 percent in income taxes even
though its earnings exceeded those of many Fortune 500 companies.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Caribbean Cruises, the second-largest cruise company,
whose headquarters overlook the port of Miami, reported profits of
$657 million over the same time. Its financial statements do not
even include a line for income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Doing business under a decades-old loophole in the federal tax
code and protected by an increasingly powerful lobbying force, the
17 major cruise lines pay practically no income tax even though
they are are based in this country and 90 percent of their
passengers are Americans. The cruise lines, all of them registered
in foreign countries, do not observe the nation's labor laws,
minimum wage law and many environmental and safety regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Just last fall, by having a senator insert a single word in the
federal budget bill, the 17 cruise concerns won an exemption from
immigration fees worth $20 million a year. In an amendment to
another bill, a congressman protected the cruise lines' monopoly on
coveted permits to sail into Glacier Bay National Park in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade the cruise industry has grown rapidly,
launching ever-bigger ships carrying thousands of passengers. Now
concern is growing over the megaships' impact on marine
environments and the impact of the industry's tax advantages on
struggling American-registered cruise ships.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, a potential battle is brewing on several fronts,
including the the foreign-registered cruise ships' major advantage:
While they earn their profits from the United States, they avoid
nearly all taxes by registering as foreign corporations and sailing
under foreign flags. They also build their giant floating resorts
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``These companies don't pay any of the taxes or live with any of
the associated costs of operating a safe vessel and paying a decent
wage,'' said Rep. Gene Taylor, D-Miss., whose district includes
shipbuilding companies, ``and it is absurd to allow them access to
the American market free of charge.``
</P>
<P>
   Last month Trent Lott, R-Miss., the Senate majority leader,
called on the Clinton administration to work with Congress to
strengthen the U.S. maritime industry by re-examining the
advantages enjoyed by foreign companies. ``This nation's tax
policies should promote business growth, not stifle it,'' Lott
said.
</P>
<P>
   And this month, two Democrats in the House of Representatives,
John Dingell of Michigan and Henry Waxman of California, initiated
an investigation by the Commerce and Government Reform committees
into illegal dumping of oily waste and other pollutants by cruise
ships, to determine whether the United States should strengthen its
regulation of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major companies may argue that they have environmental
programs in place,'' Dingell said, ``but as long as these practices
persist, it calls into question either the quality of the plans or
the commitment of senior management or both.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry representatives respond that cruise lines adhere to
strict international environmental and safety standards that are
enforced by the International Maritime Organization, a regulatory
agency affiliated with the United Nations. And they say immunity
from U.S. taxes is a long-recognized element of international law
on ocean-going trade.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise lines pay more than $66 million a year in fees to
American ports, as well as other taxes and fees, according to the
industry. And a new study done for the industry found cruise lines
bought $6.6 billion worth of U.S. goods and services in 1997,
generating 176,433 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We generate billions of dollars every year here in the U.S.
economy and the United States is a major beneficiary of our
industry,'' said Cynthia A. Colenda, president of the International
Council of Cruise Lines, which represents the 17 major cruise
lines. ``This industry is a revenue generator, and it helps
economies throughout this country.''
</P>
<P>
   While the 17 cruise lines and some of their suppliers have
prospered, however, the U.S. maritime industry has fallen on hard
times. The only cruise ship flying an American flag is the
50-year-old U.S.S. Independence, which travels among the Hawaiian
Islands, and no deep-ocean cruise ship has been built in the United
States for at least 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts are under way to develop an American-flag cruise
industry, but American shipping companies that must pay United
States taxes and wages face serious disadvantages.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. corporate income tax rate is 35 percent, though most
corporations pay a modestly lower rate through various deductions.
</P>
<P>
   If Carnival were a U.S. corporation paying taxes at the 35
percent rate _ or even if it were a foreign corporation in a
different business here _ it would have paid about $700 million in
taxes to the United States over the last three years on $2 billion
in net income.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Carnival is registered in Panama, which does not impose
a business income tax, and the company paid a total of only $15
million in income taxes _ on the earnings of one division, which
has hotels and tour operations in the United States and so is not
exempt from taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The tax break is in a section of the Internal Revenue Code that
exempts foreign corporations' income from ships and aircraft from
taxation, if the country in which the corporation is organized
offers the equivalent exemption to U.S. corporations. The rules
were set up to promote international shipping and air trade.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise companies have been able to take unique advantage of the
provision by registering in tiny countries like Liberia, Panama and
the Bahamas, which do not impose corporate income tax. Major
airlines like British Airways or Lufthansa do not pay U.S. taxes
either under the provision, but unlike the cruise lines, they are
not based in the United States, and they pay substantial taxes in
their home countries.
</P>
<P>
   And American-registered cruise companies do not benefit from a
reciprocal exemption because they remain subject to U.S. taxes,
even on their international business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our members are fully subject to U.S. income taxes, even if we
take our vessels into foreign waters,'' said Edmund B. Welch,
legislative director for the Passenger Vessel Association, the
trade group for passenger ships flying under American flags, which
are mostly sightseeing and excursion vessels. ``We have ships
relocate from the Pacific Northwest down to Mexico in the winter,''
he said, ``but they still pay U.S. taxes on their Mexican
operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign-registered cruise lines also pay workers far less than
their U.S. counterparts. Their crew members, who are mainly from
third world countries, routinely work 10 to 12 hours a day, seven
days a week, for as little as $400 a month, according to a survey
last year by Seafarers' House, a nonprofit agency that ministers to
workers at Florida ports.

 MIAMI: Florida ports.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There has never been a serious effort to alter the tax rules,
and the industry has developed an effective lobbying presence in
Washington to protect its interests.
</P>
<P>
   While all the members of the International Council of Cruise
Lines are foreign businesses, campaign finance law allows the
organization to have political action committees and raise
donations from cruise line employees who are U.S. citizens. In the
1997-98 election cycle the group donated $166,146 to House and
Senate candidates, according to the Center for Responsive Politics,
a nonpartisan organization in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The council spent more on lobbying. In its latest full-year
report filed with the Senate, the trade group said it spent
$557,023 on lobbying in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the money, $380,000, went to the law firm of Alcalde &AMP;
Fay, for work on tax and immigration issues. The firm, which is run
by Hector Alcalde, a former congressional staff member, received an
additional $200,000 in the first half of 1998. Alcalde is the
father of Cynthia Colenda, who worked at his firm before taking
over as president of the International Council of Cruise Lines.
</P>
<P>
   The effectiveness of the lobbying was evident in the budget bill
for the current fiscal year. An innocuous-looking item, Section
114, amended the immigration act by inserting a single word,
``state,'' and a comma. Doing so eliminated as much as $20 million
a year in fees from cruise lines.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service had been authorized
to assess $6 per passenger to cover inspection costs for people
arriving in American ports on cruise ships, unless their cruise had
begun in Canada, Mexico or a U.S. territory. Adding ``state''
expanded the exemption to passengers whose travel started in the
United States _ eliminating the fee for all but the tiny number of
transoceanic passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The immigration service calculated that the change cost it $20
million a year, a spokesman, Greg Gagne, said. ``We were aware that
it was going in, but it certainly wasn't our choice or our
preference,'' he said. ``We think all carriers should share in the
cost equally.''
</P>
<P>
   The actual loss to the agency was less, because the fee had not
been assessed in recent years. Gagne and industry representatives
said they did not know why.
</P>
<P>
   The change originated in the Senate, but records do not identify
its author. Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, chairman of the
Appropriations Committee, said through a spokeswoman that he knew
who wrote the section and that he had approved it, but he refused
to identify the senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Stevens is respecting the confidentiality rules of the
Senate,'' the spokeswoman, Jen Siciliano, said.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor ran into similar secrecy when he tried to close a
loophole that allows the foreign-registered cruise liness to
operate gambling cruises out of American ports.
</P>
<P>
   Under a century-old law intended to protect the American
shipping industry, ships flying foreign flags cannot travel between
American ports or leave from and return to the same American port
unless they visit a foreign port as part of the voyage. That is why
foreign cruise ships sailing from Miami or San Diego stop at a
foreign location before returning, a practice critics call
``cleansing the voyage'' for tax purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The Customs Service, however, ruled that foreign vessels meet
the requirement in some cases if they merely sail three miles out
into international waters before returning. That interpretation
allows foreign ships to operate gambling ``cruises to nowhere''
that depart from an American port, travel briefly into
international waters and return to the same port without visiting
another country.
</P>
<P>
   Those types of cruises are operated by smaller foreign cruise
lines, operating from American ports, not the major lines.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to claim that business for American ships, Taylor won
House approval three times, from 1993 to 1995, for legislation that
would require foreign-registered vessels to stop at a foreign port
even on a ``cruise to nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   But each time the bill got to the Senate, at least one anonymous
senator put a hold on it, blocking any vote. Taylor said he was
unable to identify who stopped the measure, but he said he knows
who was behind it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I went to pass that bill in the House, I will
never forget what happened to me,'' Taylor said, describing a 1993
incident. ``As I'm walking across the street to go handle the bill
on the House floor, the chief lobbyist for the foreign cruise
industry comes up and offers me and my family a free cruise if I
withdraw my bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says, `It's just so that you get to know us.' It sure
sounded like a bribe to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said the lobbyist was Alcalde. In a written response,
Alcalde called the accusation reprehensible. He said that the
congressman misunderstood what he said and that he did not even
have the authority to offer anyone a free cruise.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL GRAFS FOLLOW)
</P>
<P>
   ``It is true that I suggested he inspect the cruise ships,''
Alcalde said. ``It is important that to take a position as a
legislator, one must understand the industries that they are
attempting to regulate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is also true that I suggested that they are an excellent
vacation, especially for families. Never did I offer Taylor any
favor or incentive, and I am truly sorry that he misunderstood
those words.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL GRAFS)
</P>
<P>
   The cruise trade group opposed Taylor's bill in 1992, telling
Congress it feared that the restrictions could be applied to
broadly to its members. The next year, the group said it could
support the bill with clarifications spelling out that it was aimed
at the ``cruise to nowhere'' trade.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's influence also paid dividends last October when
Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, preserved the monopoly held by foreign
cruise lines on entry permits to Glacier Bay National Park, one of
the most popular cruise destinations.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to increase competition for concession business at
national parks, Congress last year eliminated a long-standing
provision that allowed existing operators to retain concessions by
matching the best offer from any other company. The provision made
it virtually impossible for an outside company to win a concession.
</P>
<P>
   Among the parks that would have been opened to competition was
Glacier Bay, where concerns over the environment and wildlife have
restricted entry permits for ships. The day the bill passed the
House, Young, chairman of the Committee on Resources, inserted an
amendment extending the preference for operators at Glacier Bay
until 2009.

<P>
   Young has received about $45,000 in contributions from cruise
industry employees in recent years. One of his former staff members
also works as the chief lobbyist for Holland American Line, the
division of Carnival that has the most entry permits for Glacier
Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to interview Young over the course of a week were
unsuccessful. Last fall he said that retaining the preference was
necessary to avoid disrupting cruises and to protect Alaskan
tourism. ``Cruise ship companies depend on a smooth process for
bidding on permits to enter Glacier Bay in order to accommodate the
thousands of passengers who visit this park every year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Apgar, the National Park Service concession manager for
Alaska, said in an interview that the exemption was
anti-competitive and not necessary to ensure smooth cruise
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any justification for it,'' Apgar said. ``The
industry made a special pleading and got special treatment over all
the other large concessions nationwide.''
</P>
<P>
   Three American companies with smaller ships submitted proposals
last year for some of 42 new cruise-ship permits being awarded by
the Park Service, but their prospects are slim.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big operators still have a preference and we expect our
application to be denied,'' said Gary Sorrels, vice president of
American West Steamboat in Seattle, which is planning a
250-passenger cruise ship.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the National Park Service in Washington said they
expected to award most of the new permits to Holland America, which
they said submitted the best proposal, within the next few weeks.
The company promised new studies on the impact of cruise ship noise
on whales and said it would finance on-site facility to respond to
an oil spill in the park.
</P>
<P>
   The award is likely despite Holland America's guilty plea last
August to discharging oily waste in the waters of Alaska's Inside
Passage. ``We're aware of the dumping, but Holland America's
proposal was very good,'' said Bill Pierce, the Alaska desk officer
at the park service.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Amadou Diallo's bullet-riddled body is buried in West
Africa, but the legacy of his death in a hail of police gunfire
lives on in New York.
</P>
<P>
   It reminds Adrian Thomas, 20, a black construction worker
walking his bulldog around the block in Bedford-Stuyvesant, why he
feels safer at night passing the projects than the local precinct.
``The best way to live is to stay out of their way,'' he said of
police.
</P>
<P>
   It weighs on Herbert Reed, an African-American captain in the
Department of Corrections who says young people in his Bronx
neighborhood view police as ``thugs with guns in blue uniforms.''
His peace officer's shield has become a badge of shame.
</P>
<P>
   And it baffles Brett Sonnenschein, a white graphic designer
browsing in the ``America'' aisle at the Strand bookstore in the
East Village.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just confirms all your worst fears about the police,'' said
Sonnenschein, 32, who grew up in Queens and now lives in Park
Slope, where he says he is comforted by the increased number of
officers he sees while walking home late at night. ``Is this the
price that you pay for having less crime?''
</P>
<P>
   Blacks' fear of police, and whites' struggle to understand it,
is not a new story. But at the height of New York's renaissance,
with crime lower than it has been in a generation, the Diallo
shooting has become a new lens through which people view their
relationships with police.
</P>
<P>
   In more than 100 interviews over four days, from the Riverdale
Diner to the Staten Island ferry, in an African-American bookstore
in Jamaica and a bowling alley in Bay Ridge, at a Washington
Heights coffee shop and a Fifth Avenue church, anger and fear mixed
with sadness and suspicion as people drew links between the
shooting and their own lives. Black people repeatedly offered a
numb sense of ``not again,'' while many whites sympathized, but,
inside, could never really imagine it happening to them.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the people interviewed were outraged by the number of
bullets, 41, sprayed at the unarmed black street peddler by four
white officers. Many were distressed that a young immigrant with no
criminal record could be killed in the vestibule of his own
apartment. And, in a sign of how much the fear of crime has
diminished, few could justify the aggressive police tactics that
caused such a deadly misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
   After a decade in which the crime rate plummeted and police
ranks swelled, the response to the Diallo shooting shows a city of
people deeply conflicted about their police. Middle-class white
Manhattanites, no longer very worried about their safety, are
frustrated by the ever-growing force's vigilance on petty matters
like leash violations. Young people of color in the outer boroughs,
somewhat freed from fear of drive-by shootings, brim with tales of
being patted down by undercover officers with their hands on their
guns. More than a few African Americans called the New York Police
Department ``an occupation force.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's staunch defense of the Police
Department was disdained even by Republican supporters, and the
Rev. Al Sharpton's impassioned calls for justice were admired even
by people who normally denounce him as a rabble-rouser. There was a
diverse chorus calling for sensitivity training at the Police
Academy and residency requirements that would make beat cops patrol
neighborhoods similar to the ones in which they live.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no mutual respect,'' said Russell Moorman, 32, a
black investment consultant, whose 1-year-old son was baptized
Sunday at the Riverside Church. ``There is only fear from one side,
us, and disdain from the other, them.''
</P>
<P>
   At The Strand on Saturday evening, Tal Strickland was standing
in the black studies aisle, looking at ``Beyond Racism,'' by
Whitney Young. A 57-year-old black man from Jamaica, Queens,
Strickland said he had followed news about the shooting but spoken
about it to no one. As he talked, his fury emerged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The horror is these things just keep happening and piling up
on each other,'' said Strickland, recalling the 1955 hanging of
Emmett Till, the alleged police torture of Abner Louima in 1997,
and last year's dragging death of James Byrd Jr. in Texas. ``We
talk about lynchings as if it was in our dark history, but it still
occurs.''
</P>
<P>
   Strickland's first response to the Diallo shooting was to call
his 22-year-old son, a student at Temple University who often
drives on the New Jersey Turnpike, where state troopers fired 11
bullets into a van of minority college students on their way to a
basketball clinic last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was knee-jerk, it wasn't even a thought,'' he said,
recalling nights sitting up late sipping coffee with his wife,
neither of them admitting that they were waiting to hear his key in
the lock.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs at the Strand, Louis Rogers, a 49-year-old white man
who lives near the United Nations, described the shooting as an
accident, a mistake, understandable because ``an officer is only
human.'' Rogers has a son who is 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``That lady said, this could have been your son,'' he recalled
of Diallo's mother's frequent public comments last week. ``Well,
the police officer could have been my son also.''
</P>
<P>
   Among African Americans, the experience of having unwarranted
run-ins with police seems universal. If it hasn't happened to them,
it has happened to someone they know.
</P>
<P>
   Talib Abdul-Hakeem, 23, said he has been frisked ``plenty of
times'' by police. Sometimes, he said, they stop him in front of
the Jungle Boys Pet Store on 125th Street, which he owns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have become so accustomed to it, I started to feel
passive,'' he said, flatly. ``I have been working hard since I was
11 years old, and it just doesn't seem to mean anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Tall with boyish features, Abdul-Hakeem was born and raised in
Harlem, and started working at pet stores as an adolescent. A year
and a half ago, he opened his store in Harlem, because he wanted to
contribute to the community's renewal.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether he had ever been robbed or mugged,
Abdul-Hakeem smirked; the only times he has been harassed on the
streets was by police, he said, encounters that leave him feeling
``disrespected.'' Abdul-Hakeem said he appreciates the fact that he
and his business are safer, and has tried to shrug off the run-ins
as the officers' effort to do their job. But Diallo's death, he
said, has shown him a dangerous dark side to aggressive law
enforcement. The next time he's frisked he plans to keep his mouth
shut.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that guy got killed I started feeling angry and
afraid,'' he said. ``I wondered how that could happen to an
innocent man. It seems like they have begun to cross the line.''

</P>
<P>
   Few white people deny that this happens. But it always seems to
be happening to someone else. At the Church of the Heavenly Rest on
the Upper East Side, a congregation sprinkled with mink coats and
double-strands of pearls, the son of Rosemarie Deane's black
housekeeper was shot on the subway. Kenneth Seeman Giniger, 80,
used to walk his black maid to the bus so officers would not hassle
her.
</P>
<P>
   While they do not worry about ending up on the wrong side of a
police pistol, these people, too, question the new aggressiveness
they see in police officers when they are stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``No feelings of humanness or anything else. It's by the book,
no questions asked, guilty and you're going to pay your fine,''
said Warner Butterworth, 63, a white businessman who was pulled
over by a patrol car, red lights flashing, near Columbia University
the other day. ``These policemen get really pumped. They're not
necessarily reaching for their pistol, but it's like they're going
to get you, us vs. them.''
</P>
<P>
   In churches, community meetings and the African American
Bookstore in Jamaica, questions about Diallo sparked thoughtful
conversations among blacks about long-painful issues, including a
continued sense of a lack of political and economic power; the
expanding divide between well-off African Americans and the poor,
and fears that children may grow into a world reverting back to a
more segregated and violent era.
</P>
<P>
   At the bookstore, bustling with business on President's Day,
numerous customers called the shooting ``a lynching.'' But just as
many said that ranting about Diallo's death is not enough, and that
if blacks really want change they must take their outrage to the
polls.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Corley, 37, owner of the gospel music store next door,
talked about the civil rights marches of the 1960s. Those
demonstrations, he said, opened the way for him to become a
business owner and to live a comfortable life; so comfortable, in
fact, that he sometimes feels detached from the persistent problems
of poor African Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But Diallo's killing, he said, is a signal too hard to ignore.
Corley pointed out that Diallo was a hard-working man with a
spotless record _ a man a lot like himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing black men realize is that we can get suits and
ties, we can get Mercedes and we can even get Ph.D.s,'' he said,
``but in the end, they still look at us as niggers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Riverdale Diner sits at the end of the 1/9 subway line, near
the crossroads of the highways that connect Manhattan and the
Bronx, Westchester County and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   At brunch on Monday, a group of middle-aged Jews from Riverdale
and Queens is withholding judgment until hearing the officers' side
of the story, while a white Manhattan College professor at a table
nearby denounces the shooting as ``another example of blatant
racism in the NYPD.''
</P>
<P>
   Eating waffles in one of the diner's window booths, Akila Hanna
of Bedford-Stuyvesant and Ogun Om of Universal Heights in the
Bronx, both African American, said they feel the increased police
presence more than the dropping crime rate in their communities.
Gunshots still ring through the night, Ms. Hanna said, while she
recently witnessed officers using handcuffs and physical force to
stop a neighborhood woman who receives public assistance jumping a
turnstile.
</P>
<P>
   At 50, Om said he still gets stopped and frisked. Ms. Hanna, 43,
warns her 12-year-old son not to run when he's outside, for fear
police will think he is running from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't let him go to the store by himself,'' she said. ``I'm
telling him to go against his nature, don't be an adolescent. He's
not entitled to that because it might cost him his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Veronica Clough, a white woman of 41 who lives down the block
from where she was born in Washington Heights, sees things
differently. She knows police stereotype people based on race _
officers stop her often in the predominantly Dominican community as
a suspected drug buyer. But she credits the same cops with saving
her neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's days I get stopped and hassled for ID because I'm
white,'' she said. ``Then, the other day, this kid cut me off and
there was an undercover cop right there who got him. That made my
day.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Rincon Cibaeno, a coffee shop in Ms. Clough's
neighborhood, the change has trickled inside. Just a few years ago,
counter talk was about robberies and shootings, owner Rafael
Consencion said; now, it is often about residents' run-ins with
police. ``The respect that people used to feel for the police is
turning to fear,'' he said. ``It seems that when the police come to
talk to you, it is usually because they want to trap you, not
because they want to help.''
</P>
<P>
   For Moses Mora, 35, a construction worker from the Bronx, the
Diallo shooting reminds him of his homeland, the Dominican
Republic. ``We come from countries where people are accustomed to
abuse by police and there are no laws to protect us,'' he said.
``Here we have laws to protect us, but we do not know our rights,
or we are afraid to demand our rights, or we have no money to
demand our rights. The police abuse us because of that.''
</P>
<P>
   At Mark Lanes in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, a family-oriented place
with bumpers to keep kids' balls out of the gutter, Tom Bancroft
talked in between turns as he tossed five strikes in a row.
</P>
<P>
   A white Republican who voted for Giuliani, Bancroft, 40,
described the shooting as ``vulgar'' and said he is disappointed by
the administration's ``unrepentant'' support of the officers. He
also surprised himself by nodding along with Sharpton last week,
and echoed the call from black and Latino leaders for officers to
live in the city _ even the borough _ where they work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that way in New York, the Irish beat cop that
lives there,'' he noted. ``Where's the black cop who lives there?''
</P>
<P>
   Heading home on the 5 p.m. ferry from New York to Staten Island,
several riders said that while Diallo's death is tragic, they
refuse to see it as a racist attack.
</P>
<P>
   Leonora Batten, a homemaker, clings to the hope that the
shooting was, somehow, justified. ``I would rather believe this was
a tragic mistake, than to think that the officers shot him because
of his race,'' she said. ``I don't want to believe that.

KURDISH LEADER ISOLATED ON TURKISH ISLAND

<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ All eyes turned Thursday toward a small
island in the Sea of Marmara where the Turks' most hated enemy is
being held prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   The island, called Imrali, was until Tuesday a largely unknown
place. The main building there serves as an open prison to which
pickpockets and other petty criminals are sent to serve sentences
under the loose vigilance of friendly guards.
</P>
<P>
   All of that has now changed. On Tuesday the principal Kurdish
guerrilla leader, Abdullah Ocalan, was brought to Imrali. He had
been living clandestinely in Kenya under the protection of Greek
diplomats until he was seized by Turkish commandos on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Other prisoners who had been living on Imrali were quickly moved
to other prisons, places where there are no sea breezes and no
views of passing freighters. Ocalan was placed in an isolation
cell, unable to enjoy the island's delights.
</P>
<P>
   Naval boats have been deployed around Imrali, which lies 35
miles southwest of Istanbul, and military helicopters patrol
overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors arrived on the island Thursday to begin their
interrogation of Ocalan. ``It can continue for at most seven
days,'' Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit told an interviewer in Ankara,
``but I'm sure the questioning may end before that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan is likely to be tried for treason and other crimes that
carry the death sentence. Although the death penalty remains on the
books, there have been no executions in Turkey since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Justice Ministry said Ocalan's first hearing
before a judge could come within the next two weeks, though his
trial probably will not begin for several months. They said all
judicial proceedings would be held at Imrali.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Television stations showed footage Thursday of Ocalan at Imrali.
He was standing before two Turkish flags, and at one point he
complained about the bright television lights.
</P>
<P>
   As Ocalan was undergoing his first interrogation, Turkey pressed
its fight against Kurdish nationalists on military and political
fronts.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Turkish Army said soldiers had killed five
members of Ocalan's rebel force near the eastern town of Tunceli.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers also struck guerrilla sanctuaries in northern Iraq.
Several thousand troops entered Iraq on Wednesday, and Thursday
they pounded targets with missiles fired from American-made Cobra
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   The Turkish police raided offices of the People's Democracy
Party, which is mainly Kurdish, and homes of its members in
Istanbul and eastern provinces.
</P>
<P>
   According to human rights advocates, several hundred people were
arrested. Prosecutors charge that the party functions as an arm of
Ocalan's movement.
</P>
<P>
   Other Kurds were arrested in Istanbul after a night of
disturbances in several neighborhoods, during which windows were
smashed, firebombs thrown and cars attacked.
</P>
<P>
   News reports from Kenya suggested that the American and Israeli
secret services had helped Turkish agents capture Ocalan. The
United States has denied direct involvement, and Israeli officials
said they were not involved in any way.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no Israeli role whatsoever,'' said Eli Shaked, the
Israeli Consul in Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France,
reported that it had received a complaint from Ocalan's lawyers
charging that the Turkish authorities were violating his rights to
be tried fairly and protected from torture. It said the lawyers had
asked the court to take ``emergency steps'' to protect him, but
gave no indication of whether it would seek to do so.
</P>
<P>
   A pro-Ocalan group called the Kurdish Parliament in Exile urged
Western nations to create an international court to try him, rather
than letting Turkey do so.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Brussels, a leader of the group, Zuber
Aydar, also called for ``an international conference, including
Kurdish representatives, to discuss the Kurdish question.''

CANCER PUTS GALARRAGA ON SIDELINE FOR SEASON  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Fla., Ill., Calif., Mo., Md. )   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While Darryl Strawberry is in the Yankees' spring training camp
finding out if he can overcome colon cancer and resume his career,
the Atlanta Braves announced Thursday that Andres Galarraga, their
slugging first baseman, has a cancerous tumor in his back and will
miss the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lee Kelley, a Braves orthopedist, said the lymphoma is in
the third lumbar vertebra, a small bone in Galarraga's lower back,
and will require six months of treatment: five months of
chemotherapy followed by a few weeks of radiation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's typically how you treat lymphoma,'' Kelley said by
telephone from Atlanta. ``Surgery is done if it threatens the
integrity of the bone or the spine, which it didn't. It's in a
relatively limited area.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Eric Davis played for the Baltimore Orioles while
having chemotherapy for colon cancer in 1997, Kelley said that
Galarraga's doctors do not expect him to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might be structural weakness in the bone so that it
wouldn't be safe,'' Kelley said. ``Expectations are if he resumes,
it will be after the treatment. We're all expecting that to happen,
but no one can make any promises.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves are expected to move Ryan Klesko from left field to
first base and platoon Otis Nixon and Gerald Williams in left.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga, 37, is the latest in what is becoming a growing list
of baseball players with cancer. Strawberry had surgery for colon
cancer last October and faces an uncertain future in baseball.
Davis, his friend from Los Angeles, has made a successful comeback
from the same cancer, hitting .327 in 131 games with the Orioles
last season.
</P>
<P>
   Davis signed this winter as a free agent with the St. Louis
Cardinals, where he joins two other players who have had cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Radinsky, a relief pitcher, missed the 1994 season with
Hodgkin's disease at the age of 26 but has relieved in 241 games
the last four seasons with the Chicago White Sox and the Los
Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Eli Marrero, then a rookie catcher with the Cardinals, had a
cancerous thyroid gland removed last March. He returned to play
during the season and batted .244 in 83 games.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Jackson, a former pitcher, also had thyroid cancer; Brett
Butler had throat cancer near the end of his career; Mike Gallego
had testicular cancer, and Dave Dravecky had cancer in his upper
left arm and eventually had it amputated.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga has been one of the most productive hitters in the
major leagues the last six seasons. He won the National League
batting title in 1993, led the league in home runs and runs batted
in 1996 and led it in r.b.i. in 1997. Last year, after moving to
Atlanta as a free agent, he batted .305, hit 44 home runs and drove
in 121 runs.
</P>
<P>
   The first baseman hurt his back near the end of the season, and
when he continued to have pain that limited his running and
hitting, he was summoned to Atlanta from his home in West Palm
Beach, Fla., for tests earlier this month. A magnetic resonance
imaging test discovered the tumor.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley said CAT scans indicated that the cancer had not spread
to Galarraga's chest or abdomen. He said Galarraga was scheduled
for one more test, a bone marrow aspiration, Friday.

 &HT;    Lyons mum at corruption trial
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LARGO, Fla. _ He has dazzled congregations and conventions with
uplifting oratory, but embattled Baptist leader Henry Lyons chose
not to address the jury that will judge him on racketeering
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Lyons, the head of one of the nation's largest
African-American denominations, rested their case Thursday without
calling Lyons to the stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wrestled a great deal with whether or not to testify,''
said attorney Denis de Vlaming. ``He wanted to get on that stand
and deny that he had done anything wrong. But we have concerns
because Dr. Lyons is facing a federal trial in a few months.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyons' co-defendant, Bernice Edwards, took the stand late
Thursday in her own defense.
</P>
<P>
   The pair are charged with stealing some $4 million from
corporations wanting to do business with the members of the
National Baptist Convention USA.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say Lyons, a Florida-based minister who is the
group's president, spent much of the money on luxury items,
including diamond rings and furs for several mistresses, as well as
a Lake Tahoe condo and a $700,000 waterfront home in St.
Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his troubles, Lyons has drawn staunch support from
several of the National Baptist Convention's top leaders, with some
claiming in out-of-court statements that he has been victimized by
the media. Lyons is still president of the group, and has said he
will run for another term this year.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two weeks, witnesses for Lyons have tried to
convince the jury that there was no grand conspiracy to steal money
from the corporations, which hoped to market credit cards, funeral
services and insurance policies to black Baptists.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the defense contends, Lyons is guilty of nothing
more than failed business deals.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors allege Lyons promised the companies a list of the
convention's supposed 8.5 million members, complete with names and
addresses, though he knew no such list existed.
</P>
<P>
   A former statistician for the convention testifying for Lyons
said the 8.5 million number was based upon surveys he conducted
with thousands of ministers attending the group's annual
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Upon cross-examination, though, Rev. H.L. Harvey admitted he
never compiled any list of names, and that most ministers would be
extremely reluctant to release their church membership rolls to
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Edwards testified that she knew nothing about any
membership list until Lyons and another man called her in September
1995 and asked her to get a list of millions of African-American
names and addresses needed to fulfill a $400,000 contract Lyons had
made with the Globe Life Insurance Co.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, whom Lyons had hired as the convention's director of
public relations, said she was not told to find the names of
convention members or even of black Baptists, just
African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked in the Yellow Pages,'' she said, until she found a
direct marketing firm that provided the list for $115,000.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Lyons' daughter testified that she spent months working
on the list, but admitted she never compiled more than about 90,000
names.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter, Stephanie Lyons, also admitted the effort started
months after her father had entered into contracts with companies
that believed the list was ready and waiting.
</P>
<P>
   An accountant hired by Lyons' defense team testified that Lyons
made no secret of the money he received from the corporations _ an
effort to defuse claims by the prosecution that Lyons tucked the
money away in secret accounts.
</P>
<P>
   But John Magliano acknowledged under cross-examination that he
found no records to refute prosecution claims that Lyons spent much
of the money on gifts for mistresses and other luxury items.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys said Lyons made the decision not to testify on
his own after consulting his family and praying over it.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers had asked Judge Susan Schaeffer to limit questions
prosecutors could ask on cross-examination, but Schaeffer advised
them she would likely allow most questions.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, he faces up to 30 years in prison.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The retired chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
who led a State Department investigation of bombings of two U.S.
embassies in Africa last summer said on Thursday that the
department is so fearful of demanding additional money from
Congress that it could leave other embassies vulnerable to
terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., who is also a former
ambassador to London, said the embassy security budget that the
State Department requested this month was clearly inadequate and
would leave American diplomats abroad vulnerable. The department,
he said, may be asking for only enough to ``get the pressure off
their back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The State Department is certainly intimidated by the
Congress,'' Crowe said, noting that the department had asked for $3
billion over five years, much less than half the amount that two
expert panels recommended. ``I think there are going to be more
attacks, and we are going to lose more lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed budget, he suggested, would not allow the
replacement of several embassies that are vulnerable to terrorism.
Crowe noted that the State Department had committed itself to
rebuilding the embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania, the two destroyed in the bombings that killed more than
220 people. ``It seems like the best way to get a new embassy built
is to have yours blown away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The blunt criticisms, in an interview and in a statement
prepared after the interview, apparently reflect the admiral's
anger at the State Department for having failed to act on key
recommendations of the report he prepared at the department's
request on the bombings in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Senior department officials rejected much of the criticism,
insisting that this month's budget requests would result in a
significant improvement of security and that more money would be
requested shortly.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen J. Charles, the deputy assistant secretary of state for
budget and planning, said in an interview that the $3 billion would
allow for building 50 to 60 embassies and other diplomatic
missions, mostly replacements for existing structures. ``The
Congress has been extraordinarily supportive of our requests,'' she
said, noting that Congress approved a separate $1.4 billion for
diplomatic security in an emergency bill last October. ``They are
anxious to work with us on this. But we all have to work within
budgetary constraints.''
</P>
<P>
   In its request, the State Department said it would seek $3
billion over five years to fortify and rebuild diplomatic missions
abroad, for an average of $600 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   In their final report last month, the two panels led by Crowe _
one studied the bombing in Kenya, the other the Tanzania case _
recommended a much larger budget: $14 billion over the next decade,
or about $1.4 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Crowe said the requests made by the State Department ``suggest a
timid approach to the problem _ deja vu.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My instincts, he added, ``are that they might try to do what
they always do. They do just enough to get the pressure off their
backs and not commit so much that they've got a real financial
problem. I don't like the budget figures I've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that failing to push for more money could cost lives.
``We're talking money vs. lives here,'' he said. ``The idea that we
cannot outspend the terrorists or defeat them runs counter to our
history and spirit. ''
</P>
<P>
   Crowe was careful to make clear that his remarks were not meant
as criticism of Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was ``imperative that Secretary Albright is
personally involved'' in the campaign to improve security. ``And I
think that is happening,'' he said. ``She's saying the right
things. I believe she is sincere.''
</P>
<P>
   But as a former military commander and ambassador, Crowe said,
he has seen how both the Pentagon and the State Department handle
their employees. ``The military,'' he said, ``takes better care of
its people. The entire State Department has got to begin taking
responsibility for security, and each individual has to do things
to improve his own personal security. They've got to start taking
it seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   He was harshly critical of Congress, where the Republican
leadership has repeatedly tried to cut the State Department's
overall budget, and the Office of Management and Budget, which
monitors the department's budget for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your instincts would tell you that saving lives would strike a
sympathetic nerve in the Congress, but that's not always true,'' he
said. ``I'm afraid that Congress will once again put money in front
of lives on their priority list. The threat is greater than it has
ever been, and token sums of money will suggest that they do not
give the threats much credit.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the Office of Management and Budget ``has a history
of slashing back State'' and that the ``overall blame'' for
inadequate security at embassies ``should be collectively shared by
Congress, State and the OMB.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the House International Affairs Committee,
Lester E. Munson, rejected the criticism of Capitol Hill, noting
that in 1997 and 1998 Congress provided the State Department a
total of $47 million more for diplomatic security beyond the budget
requested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress has over the long term been very committed to working
with the administration on diplomatic security issues,'' Munson
said. ``The problem comes in trying to politicize this issue, and
we're very much trying to resist that.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Ricci, a spokeswoman for the Office of Management and
Budget, said that the State Department's budget requests to
Congress ``included the most sustained long-term commitment for
embassy security ever.''

PRESSURES MOUNT AGAINST DEFIANT MILOSEVIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMBOUILLET, France _ As the deadline neared for a settlement in
the Kosovo peace talks, the military and diplomatic pressure
mounted Thursday on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to choose
between tolerating NATO-led peacekeepers in the province of Kosovo
or suffering NATO air strikes for refusing them.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said she again spelled out
the choice in a telephone call to the Yugoslav leader and that she
would return Saturday to the talks, which she visited last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has remained in Belgrade throughout the negotiations,
set to finish at noon Saturday, and diplomats here do not rule out
a high-level trip to the Yugoslav capital before a final agreement
is reached.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, an authoritarian leader who values his grip on power
above all else, will essentially make his decision based on what
least erodes his position, said Clinton administration and European
officials involved in the talks Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   They said it appeared that Milosevic would finally calculate
that air strikes _ threatened by NATO as punishment for failing to
agree to foreign soldiers on his territory _ would be more
destabilizing to his rule than NATO-led ground troops keeping the
peace in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But the officials said that Milosevic was bound to keep everyone
on tenterhooks until the very last moment, and possibly for some
hours or a day beyond the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   A senior European diplomat involved in the negotiations, who
knows Serbia well, said that top officers in the Yugoslav army had
told Milosevic that it would be very difficult for the military to
recover from air strikes against air defense systems in Serbia and
Kosovo, a southern province of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly a decade of wars, sanctions and official
corruption, Yugoslavia, which consists of Serbia and Montenegro, is
economically weak and could not afford to repair the damage to its
military installations, the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials and the European diplomat said they
could not be certain of Milosevic's decision. Thus preparations
were moving ahead both for air strikes and, in the event of a
settlement, the deployment of ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon announced Wednesday night that it had ordered an
additional 51 planes to Europe to beef up NATO air power already
poised to bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Boris Yeltsin said Thursday that he had warned
President Clinton that Russia opposed air strikes. But the White
House discounted Yeltsin's statement, saying it had been quite a
while since the two leaders had spoken.
</P>
<P>
   To stress the gravity of the choice facing Milosevic, the two
top NATO officials flew Thursday to Skopje, Macedonia, which
borders Kosovo, to finalize details for the deployment of troops
and, in the case of air strikes, the evacuation of international
monitors from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,300 monitors, several hundred of whom are American, would
drive out of Kosovo starting Sunday if the peace talks failed, a
NATO official said. The monitors, who have been trying to defuse
the tensions between the ethnic Albanian fighters of the Kosovo
Liberation Army and the Serbian security forces, would have to
leave Kosovo before air strikes could begin.
</P>
<P>
   The three foreign diplomats who have so far led 11 days of talks
between the Serbian and ethnic Albanian delegations here said at a
news conference that both sides had been presented Thursday with a
final version of the political settlement.
</P>
<P>
   There was a lot of grumbling from both delegations, the
negotiators said, about details in the plan that call for a new
constitution and legislature for a three-year period during which
Kosovo would become autonomous from Serbia. Kosovo, where 90
percent of the estimated 2 million inhabitants are ethnic
Albanians, was stripped of its autonomy in 1989 by Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic Albanian delegation, for example, was unhappy with a
proposal to add a second chamber to the new legislature, in effect
potentially giving the Serbs veto power, said an adviser to the
delegation, Filippo di Robilant.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomats made clear, though, that the political aspects of
the peace settlement would not be the deal breaker.
</P>
<P>
   The American in the trio, Ambassador Christopher Hill, who flew
to see Milosevic on Tuesday night, said he did not ``rule in or
rule out'' another trip to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has announced that a force of about 28,000 soldiers, mostly
European but including up to 4,000 Americans, would be deployed to
keep peace in Kosovo, an impoverished region about the size of
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers would supervise the demilitarization over an
undefined period _ probably six months _ of the ethnic Albanian
insurgents, the Kosovo Liberation Army, and would insure that
Serbian police and Yugoslav army drastically reduced their forces
to levels stipulated in the peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Already, there is a hint that Milosevic is trying to deal with
what amounts to his propaganda problem _ how to explain to his
public that NATO troops are acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman for Milosevic's Socialist Party, Ivica Dacic, said
Thursday that foreign troops ``without the assent of our country''
would be considered ``an aggression against our country.'' By using
these words, Dacic had moved away from Milosevic's previous
insistence that foreign troops would be a breach of Serbia's
sovereignty, raising instead the possibility that they could be
invited in.
</P>
<P>
   In weighing his options, Milosevic has also been ``discreetly''
told by European countries that agreeing to a peace settlement and
implementing it might end investment sanctions imposed on him last
summer because of the Kosovo crisis, the European diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Clinton administration official said, however, that
Washington had not made any hints that it would consider easing
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   A seasoned Serbian analyst of Milosevic, Bratislav Grubacic,
wrote Thursday in his daily newsletter VIP that Serbians _ and the
world _ had to hope that Milosevic would not be so foolish as to
follow in the footsteps of a 14th-century hero of Serbian history.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hope that he will not follow the example of Prince Lazar,
who in 1389 decided to fight it out, lost the battle of Kosovo and
became a legendary loser, ushering in five centuries of slavery
under the Turks,'' Grubacic wrote, turning on its head the usual
Serbian legend about that battle marking the start of a successful
500-year struggle to preserve Eastern Orthodox Christianity under
the Muslim rule of the Ottoman Turks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing Milosevic, it is hard to believe that he's prepared to
abandon his life of ease in his Belgrade Dedinje residence,''
Grubacic noted, referring to Milosevic's handsome palace.

YANKEES GET ROGER CLEMENS IN THEIR BIGGEST DEAL SINCE BABE RUTH

 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ In their most significant deal since the purchase
of Babe Ruth 79 years ago, the Yankees traded Thursday for Roger
Clemens, regarded as perhaps the greatest pitcher of his era. The
Yankees won the World Series and a record 125 games in 1998, and
now with Clemens they may be even better in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In return for Clemens, the Yankees traded the popular starting
pitcher David Wells, who threw a perfect game at Yankee Stadium
last May 17, to the Toronto Blue Jays, along with two other
players, relief pitcher Graeme Lloyd and infielder Homer Bush.
</P>
<P>
   It was a shocking deal that came together in less than 10 hours
and brought the Yankees the only five-time winner of the Cy Young
Award, given annually to a league's best pitcher. ``You can equate
this with getting a Michael Jordan,'' said George Steinbrenner, the
Yankees' principal owner, drawing a comparison to the basketball
icon. ``We're getting a man who makes it a notable day in Yankee
history.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, known as the Rocket, already is something of a legend:
a contentious, hard-throwing Texan who routinely tries to
intimidate hitters by aiming his fastball at them. Clemens is 36,
with a history of some arm and back problems, but he has shown no
recent signs of wear: He was named the American League Cy Young
Award winner each of the last two seasons and had a 20-6 record
last year, leading the league in victories, strikeouts and earned
run average.
</P>
<P>
   With him, the Yankees will be overwhelming favorites to win the
World Series again. ``The Yankees,'' a Toronto executive said,
``are in a league of their own.''
</P>
<P>
   The trade comes with some risk. Wells, 35, was the league's best
left-hander last season, winning 18 games and losing four, and he
ranks among the finest postseason pitchers ever, with an 8-1
record. Clemens has never played with a championship team and has
one victory in nine career postseason starts.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Wells' nonconformist approach toward the game _ his
acknowledged penchant for staying out late and his bemused aversion
to conditioning _ endeared him to Yankee fans even before he threw
his perfect game. After that accomplishment, he took on a hero's
aura while retaining his ``regular guy'' image. Throughout the New
York metropolitan region on Thursday fans expressed regret at
losing him from the city's sports scene, even as they acknowledged
Clemens' greatness.
</P>
<P>
   But even David Cone, perhaps Wells' closest friend on the
Yankees, agreed that it was a great trade for the team. ``How can
you not be pleased when you add the best pitcher in the game?''
Cone said, shrugging slightly.
</P>
<P>
   At the Yankees' spring training complex, Wells, whose lifelong
ambition was to play for the Yankees, was subdued after receiving
the news. ``I'm a little emotional right now,'' Wells said. ``Just
give me a couple of days. It's a little tough to take.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, however, was ecstatic. ``I know the tradition,'' he
said in a conference call from his home in Texas. ``I love it. I
love pitching at Yankee Stadium, the monuments, all the stuff that
goes with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens ranks first among active pitchers in victories (233),
strikeouts (3,153) and shutouts (44), is third in earned run
average (2.95) and is destined for the Hall of Fame. The Yankees
have signed notable free agents, such as Reggie Jackson, Rich
Gossage and Dave Winfield, but not since obtaining Ruth from the
Red Sox in 1920 for $125,000 and a $300,000 loan have they made a
deal of this magnitude.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens considered joining the Yankees after the 1996 season,
when he left the Boston Red Sox as a free agent. Steinbrenner tried
wooing Clemens personally, going to the pitcher's home in the
Houston area to chat and lift weights.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, however, signed a three-year, $25 million deal with the
Blue Jays that contained an option for the 2000 season, and an oral
agreement that Clemens could demand a trade at any time. Clemens'
option kicked in automatically during last season, and he is to be
paid $8 million for 1999 and $8.1 million for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens was overpowering in the final two-thirds of last season;
he did not lose in his last 22 starts and the Blue Jays finished
strongly, falling just short of a wild-card spot in the playoffs.
But after the season, Clemens announced that he wanted to be
traded, indicating that he did not believe the Blue Jays would be
competitive enough in 1999 and that he was dedicated to winning a
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto tried and failed to trade Clemens before Christmas, with
Houston Astros officials angrily pulling out of the bidding after
the pitcher's agents asked for what amounted to $27.4 million for
one extra year. Clemens did this after Kevin Brown signed the
richest pitching contract in baseball history, trying to lift his
average annual salary up to that level.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees made only one pitiful trade offer for Clemens _
Bush, who is a little-used 26-year-old player, and two
minor-leaguers. With Blue Jays officials taking heat for their oral
agreement allowing a trade demand _ it turned out to be a violation
of baseball rules _ Clemens withdrew his trade demand Dec. 22.
</P>
<P>
   But Gord Ash, Toronto's general manager, was intent on trading
Clemens, and he wanted a pitcher in return. As the start of spring
training loomed, he kept calling Brian Cashman, the Yankees'
general manager, and raised the possibility of including Wells, as
well as top prospects in the Yankees' organization. But Clemens was
a tired issue to Cashman, who tried changing the subject when Ash
called.
</P>
<P>
   Cashman received a voice mail message from Ash on Tuesday and
did not return the message until Wednesday, calling from his car
phone at 2:30 p.m. Ash was ready to deal Clemens, and he wanted an
offer from the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``No, Gord,'' Cashman countered. ``If you've got something in
mind, then make me an offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Ash's response ``made my knees buckle,'' Cashman said: Clemens
for Wells, Lloyd and Bush. The Yankees had a chance to get Clemens
without surrendering any of their top young prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Cashman immediately called Steinbrenner. ``Run that by me
again,'' Steinbrenner said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees began a staff meeting at 4 p.m., and at 7 o'clock
the group moved to Malios, a Tampa area restaurant, to debate the
trade proposal. At 9 p.m., Clemens' agents called the pitcher to
tell him of the developments. ``It looks like were going to get a
second chance with the Yankees,'' Clemens told his wife, Debra, and
he pumped a fist happily.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner's seven baseball advisers, including Cashman and
manager Joe Torre, agreed unanimously to make the trade. At 11:42
p.m. _ Cashman said he noted the time for posterity on his clock
radio _ the Yankees completed the deal. Torre called Clemens to
welcome him, but Cashman and Torre decided to wait until Thursday
morning to tell Wells in person, after he arrived at Legends Field
for the first workout.
</P>
<P>
   Wells strolled in, wearing shorts and a T-shirt, and plopped
down in his chair. ``Boomer, I need to talk to you,'' Cashman said,
calling Wells by his nickname.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about?'' Wells said gruffly.
</P>
<P>
   Wells wore a grin as he walked into Torre's office. ``First day
and I'm in the principal's office,'' Wells said, and then Cashman
delivered the news. ``Wow,'' Wells said, expressionless, as if
someone had punched him on the chin.
</P>
<P>
   Torre and Cashman thanked him for being part of the '98
championship team, and Wells signed a couple of baseballs for Torre
and returned to the clubhouse, packing his bag. Word filtered
through the Yankees clubhouse: Boomer was traded. Clemens is
coming.
</P>
<P>
   When Wells moved toward the door, carrying his bag, he bumped
into Cone, who had just arrived. As Wells spoke, he turned his body
so that Cone could not see his eyes. Wells had always wanted to be
a Yankee, he loved pitching for the Yankees, and he was near tears,
Cone was certain. Wells met with Steinbrenner, and then he was
gone. It happens this way in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Because Clemens was dealt in the middle of a multiyear contract,
he can demand a trade after this season, and at that time could try
to force the Yankees into giving him an extension.
</P>
<P>
   But Steinbrenner, ultracompetitive, does not care about that
now. His baseball team, the most successful in history, acquired
Roger Clemens. Steinbrenner called him Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally got you,'' Steinbrenner said.

RENO CONSIDERING HANDING OVER INQUIRY ON STARR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Utah)  (js) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON and DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department is considering whether to
appoint a special investigative prosecutor to conduct its inquiry
into charges of possible misconduct by Kenneth Starr, government
officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   One specific proposal discussed in recent days is the
appointment of a U.S. attorney, possibly one with solid Republican
credentials, who would supervise a team of Justice Department
prosecutors and FBI agents, said the officials who spoke on the
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno, who is traveling in South
Africa, has not reached any decision on the matter, the officials
said. But in recent days her aides have weighed a variety of
options should the attorney general choose to take the
investigation of the independent counsel away from the Office of
Professional Responsibility, the Justice Department's in-house
ethics unit.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation will focus on whether Starr's prosecutors
improperly coerced witnesses like Monica Lewinsky, disclosed grand
jury secrets to the news media and withheld possible conflicts of
interest from Justice Department lawyers at the outset of the
Lewinsky inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions at the Justice Department follow an exchange of
rancorous correspondence in recent days between department
officials and lawyers in Starr's office. In a letter to Ms. Reno
late last week, Starr criticized what he regarded as unauthorized
disclosures to the news media about the Justice Department's
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Starr also suggested that the Justice Department could not be
trusted to conduct an unbiased inquiry, the officials said. On
Thursday, Charles Bakaly, a spokesman for Starr, would not discuss
the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, the officials said, favors an alternate approach that
would shift the inquiry beyond Ms. Reno's direct control. Starr
prefers the appointment of a lawyer from outside the Justice
Department with broad legal experience, someone agreed upon by Ms.
Reno and Starr.
</P>
<P>
   One person mentioned by Starr as the kind of candidate with the
stature to carry out such an inquiry was former Attorney General
Griffin Bell, who served under President Jimmy Carter and is 80
years old. A representative of Bell said Thursday that he was
traveling and unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers have also expressed reservations about whether
the Office of Professional Responsibility should supervise the
inquiry. Last Friday, Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, questioned the impartiality of the office, one
official said.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with Eric Holder, the deputy attorney general,
Hatch expressed dismay at news articles about the inquiry into
Starr's conduct in the Lewinsky matter, the officials said, adding
that Hatch suggested that the Justice Department consider
alternatives to allowing their office to carry out the
investigation. Justice Department officials would not comment on
the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Should Ms. Reno ultimately refer the matter to an outside
counsel, it would symbolically bring the Whitewater investigation
full circle. Depending on the precise powers granted to such a
counsel, Starr and his prosecutors could be forced to submit to the
kind of intense scrutiny that Starr has trained on President
Clinton and White House aides since August 1994.

FORMER PRISON BUDDY TESTIFIES AGAINST SUSPECT IN DRAGGING DEATH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Optional ending included) 
 
By PATTY REINERT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ A year before James Byrd Jr.'s dragging death,
John William ``Bill'' King was sitting in prison, plotting a brutal
initiation rite for recruits to a hate group he would start back
home in Jasper: Kidnap a black man, put him in the trunk of a car,
drive into the woods and kill him, a former prison buddy told
jurors Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had to take someone out _ blood in, blood out,'' William
Matthew Hoover testified on the third day of King's capital murder
trial. ``You have to spill blood to get in and you have to give
blood to get out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to get out is if you're dead,'' added Hoover, 28.
Asked if his life was in jeopardy for testifying against King, the
ex-con nodded and mumbled, ``Yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   King, 24, will face either life in prison or death by injection
if he is convicted in the killing of Byrd, a 49-year-old disabled
black man who was taken to a remote wooded area, chained to a
pickup and dragged down a rural road June 7.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have said King and co-defendant Lawrence Russell
Brewer Jr., 31, both members of the Confederate Knights of America
prison gang, killed Byrd to draw recruits to their own chapter of
the CKA in Jasper, which King planned to call the Texas Rebel
Soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Their first recruit may have been the third defendant in the
case, Shawn Allen Berry, 24, who had been friends with King since
high school.
</P>
<P>
   Or, Hoover suggested, it could have been that King and Brewer
were completing their own initiation to the prison CKA. Many prison
gang members have to complete their so-called ``blood-in'' after
they are released from prison, he said, because killing someone
while in prison would land them on death row.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, defense attorneys challenged a police detective's
characterizations of King's numerous tattoos as racist and satanic,
and a parade of FBI agents took the stand to testify about physical
evidence in the case _ the tires from Berry's pickup, the flesh and
blood they found on the vehicle's undercarriage, and cigarette
butts and beer bottles found at the crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   But the most dramatic moment came late in the afternoon, when
jurors got their first look at the 24 1/2-foot-long, rusted logging
chain prosecutors say was used to drag Byrd to his death. After his
arrest, Berry led police to a shallow hole outside a friend's
trailer home where the chain had been hidden under a piece of
plywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was chilling, that's all I can say,'' said Byrd's sister,
Clara Taylor, who was seated on the front row when FBI agent Norm
Townsend and prosecutor Pat Hardy pulled the chain out and strung
it across the room. ``It reminded you of slave days.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoover, now a college student in Missouri, was a member of the
Aryan Brotherhood while serving an aggravated robbery sentence at
the Beto I prison in Tennessee Colony in 1996. While there, he met
King and Brewer, serving time for burglary, and although they
belonged to rival gangs, they stuck together as white supremacists
and fellow ``Woods,'' white prisoners who united to protect each
other against minority inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in 1997, Hoover asked King, a prolific letter-writer,
to sign his prison album, a sort of memory book filled with
drawings, photos and tributes from fellow inmates. In his note,
which prosecutors entered into evidence Thursday, King called
Hoover ``a true and tried Wood'' and ``my Aryan brother in arms,''
and invited him to a party he was planning for Independence Day
1998, the date King planned to start the Texas Rebel Soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``And don't forget,'' King wrote, ``a huge Wood gathering,
B.B.Q., and bashing on July 4, 1998 ... DESTROY, ERASE, IMPROVE.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoover told the predominantly white jury that he understood the
``bashing'' to mean that King was suggesting the racists get
together to ``beat someone up.'' By the time the party date
arrived, King, Brewer and Berry were already back in jail, charged
with Byrd's kidnapping and murder.
</P>
<P>
   On cross-examination, defense attorney Brack Jones Jr. asked
Hoover to explain why whites and blacks join gangs in prison and
decorate their skin with elaborate tattoos. (About 65 percent of
King's body is covered in tattoos, some of which have been termed
racist and satanic.)
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer suggested that a gang affiliation is necessary for
protection from sexual assault in the violent and racially charged
environment.
</P>
<P>
   After pointing out that the Beto I prison population is 70
percent black, Jones asked, ``If you're a 5-foot-7 white man
without tattoos, you're more likely to be approached and tested if
you're gonna be a 'ho' (whore) or a 'Wood,' than someone who has a
lot of tattoos, right?''
</P>
<P>
   After jurors went home for the day, Jones indicated his
cross-examination questions were geared toward the punishment phase
of the trial, if King is convicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mitigating, if nothing else,'' he said. ``Our system
caused his problem.''
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter responded, ``But the system's not on trial,'' he
answered, ``Yes, it is.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Jones and C. Haden ``Sonny'' Cribbs Jr.
challenged Jasper police Detective Rich Ford's interpretations of
King's tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   Jones drew a picture of what he said Ford interpreted as a
baphomet, an upside-down pentagram, which King has tattooed in his
armpit. Ford had characterized the baphomet as a satanic symbol the
day before.
</P>
<P>
   Then Jones replaced his drawing with a slide of the Medal of
Honor given by Congress, which has a similar shape, and suggested
that different people would interpret the symbol in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   He also suggested that what Ford said was a tattoo of Church of
Satan founder Anton LaVay was similar to a comic book character
that was found in King's apartment.

 &HT;    Managed care movement in Georgia gains steam
 &HT;    By Kathey Pruitt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Legislature slowed Thursday for the start of a
brief budget recess, but the buzz over Gov. Roy Barnes'
far-reaching proposals to reform managed care only intensified one
day after he unveiled specifics to expand doctor choice and HMO
liability.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes' staff met with business, insurance and HMO
representatives for their first look at legislation to be
introduced Monday. But despite Barnes' attempt to smooth some of
the resistance, critics remained unconvinced.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to arguments about skyrocketing premiums and
employers' canceling coverage that always accompanies proposed
changes in managed care, critics of Barnes' plan are employing a
new ally in the debate: time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of where you fall down on this issue, the fact is
this is something that's very complicated,'' said Betsey Weltner,
lobbyist for the Georgia Association of HMOS. ``Nine days isn't
enough time to study something of this magnitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurance and business groups say they want to conduct actuarial
studies to pinpoint precise costs of Barnes' proposals. But with
more than half of the Legislature's 40-day session gone and rules
requiring that bills clear one chamber within nine more working
days or be held, there's little opportunity for intensive review.
Political scientists say pushing that point may be the critics'
best chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have to say 'help us kill it,''' said Charles
Bullock, a University of Georgia political scientist. ``Just 'let's
be sure it gets a thorough airing.' That's an easier sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials, however, say they're wise to that
ploy. ``They've run up against a governor who doesn't mind
considering legitimate questions,'' said spokesman Gary Horlacher.
``But he's going to resist the delaying tactics _ delaying to the
point of death.''
</P>
<P>
   Who wins the battle could depend on which committees are
assigned to the bills. It appears the edge goes to the new
governor.
</P>
<P>
   His bill to hold managed care liable for injury resulting from
denied care might have a more difficult time moving through the
House Insurance Committee, historically reluctant to restrictions.
But Barnes' bill hinges on tort statutes in the state law, and
therefore appears headed to the Judiciary Committee, of which he
was a member.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes' plan to let patients go to any doctor who agrees to the
terms of their HMO will start in the Senate and could be assigned
to the Health and Human Services Committee, chaired by his
assistant floor leader, Sen. Connie Stokes (D-Decatur). Or it could
move to the Insurance Committee, where business and HMO supporters
think they'll have a better shot.
</P>
<P>
   But Insurance Committee chairman Sen. Eddie Madden (D-Elberton)
says he agrees with the general concepts of the bill and is
inclined to move quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect the governor and will certainly give him front
burner in my committee,'' Madden said.

 WASHINGTON: August 1994.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Still, it is unclear how much authority would be granted to an
outside counsel. There is no provision in the law that permits Ms.
Reno to seek an independent counsel to investigate Starr's
operation. But Justice Department officials have concluded that
under Ms. Reno's statutory authority, she could appoint a
prosecutor with the same power that an independent counsel has to
convene grand juries and compel testimony under oath.
</P>
<P>
   But the officials said that the inquiry, as currently
envisioned, would more likely be administrative rather than
criminal. As such, the maximum penalties if wrongdoing is found
would probably amount to no more than reprimands, suspensions or
dismissals, rather than felony or misdemeanor charges.
Nevertheless, the lawyer who leads the inquiry would almost
certainly ask Starr's prosecutors to turn over highly sensitive
information about how they investigated the president.
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether an attorney general has the authority to
investigate an independent counsel remains unresolved. There is no
language in the statute that even addresses how an independent
counsel would be investigated. Under the law, the attorney general
is given the sole authority to determine whether to remove an
independent counsel. But Ms. Reno's aides and Starr's prosecutors
have argued for months over whether that responsibility also gives
her the inherent power to investigate him. This unsettled debate
has stalled the Justice Department inquiry of Starr's office, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 provides for
the appointment of an independent counsel if there are specific
criminal accusations against any individual among about two dozen
officials who qualify as ``covered officials'' in the Executive
Branch, like the president and vice president. Independent counsels
are not among the officials designated as ``covered'' by the law.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the officials said, the deliberations at the Justice
Department to move the inquiry beyond the direct control of the
attorney general are an attempt to address Starr's concerns that
the Justice Department cannot conduct an impartial inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   In his complaint letter to the Justice Department last week,
Starr objected to news reports that disclosed the scope of the
internal inquiry and the long-running conflict between the
independent counsel's office and the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Ms. Reno has named senior prosecutors to handle
difficult cases. She selected Michael R. Stiles, the top federal
prosecutor in Philadelphia, to head an inquiry into the 1992 Ruby
Ridge standoff in Idaho. And in 1997, she selected Charles G. La
Bella, a senior federal prosecutor in San Diego, to investigate
campaign finance issues.
</P>
<P>
   But finding a prosecutor with Republican credentials late in the
second term of a Democratic president's second term could be
difficult. One person mentioned as a possible candidate is Robert
Mueller, the acting U.S. attorney in San Francisco. Mueller, who
headed the Justice Department's criminal division during the Bush
administration, said Thursday that he had heard nothing about the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   At Starr's office, prosecutors remain highly suspicious of Ms.
Reno, associates of Starr said. They challenged the timing of the
Justice Department inquiry, saying that it surfaced shortly before
the Senate voted to acquit Clinton, at a time when Starr appeared
to be politically vulnerable. And they argue that some of the
allegations have been known publicly for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   One associate of Starr recently called the Justice Department
investigation ``politically motivated'' and wondered aloud whether
an aggressive investigation that targeted Starr had been quietly
encouraged by a vengeful White House. Several weeks ago, another
associate of Starr predicted that ``the heat would be turned up''
on the office after the Senate acquitted the president.

CHIRAC, IN U.S., OFFERS ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO ECONOMIC CRISES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Jacques Chirac of France, visiting
Washington, openly split with the U.S. approach to stabilizing the
world economy a day before meeting President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech Thursday to the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund, Chirac urged that the United States, Japan and
Europe manage the exchange rates of their currencies, keeping them
within specific zones, agreed on by the major nations, to restore
stability to the world economy. That is an idea that Japan and
Germany have echoed, but on Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Robert E.
Rubin dismissed the suggestion as unworkable and ill thought out.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac's suggestion that the world's three main currencies _ the
dollar, yen and euro _ remain within ``target zones'' is part of a
broader agenda he brings here for a very activist approach to
taking some of the risk out of the world economy. He has also
called for far greater regulation of hedge funds _ huge pools of
money put together by private investors _ and for an early warning
system to detect crises.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must increase our capacity for crisis prevention,'' Chirac
said Thursday. ``We must adopt a veritable traffic code or highway
code for capital flows, a code which applies to all, including
hedge funds and offshore establishments.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin, a 26-year veteran of Wall Street, has been cautious about
each of the suggestions, and openly dismissive of a few. Early
warning systems, he pointed out recently, sound like a good idea,
but rarely work in practice. The IMF, he has noted, has a poor
record of predicting when and where a crisis will erupt, and
private credit-rating organizations failed to flag the troubles
that set off the crisis in Asia, Latin America and Russia that has
rocked much of the world over the last 20 months.
</P>
<P>
   The issues are bound to come up on Friday, when Chirac meets
with President Clinton, a session that the Treasury said Thursday
Rubin would also attend.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments over how to construct what Chirac on Thursday
called a ``new financial architecture'' have been building for
months. The differences are likely to become evident on Saturday,
at a meeting in Bonn of the finance ministers and central bankers
of the seven largest industrial nations. The annual session is
designed to set the agenda for the Group of Seven leaders meeting
later this year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We don't know how hard Chirac will press all of this face to
face with the president,'' one of Clinton's aides said Thursday.
``And Clinton himself is conflicted on this, because he likes the
idea of political leaders pressing to do more than just technical
fixes.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin's strong criticism of the proposal to regulate exchange
rates came at a news conference Wednesday. He noted that if the
U.S. economy went into a downturn, and the value of its currency
also fell, Europe and Japan might prescribe a rise in U.S. interest
rates in an attempt to bring the value of the dollar back up. But
that move could choke off growth, worsening the economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that the way you achieve stability is to use
fundamental economic policy,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the issue are questions of sovereignty _ the
United States is loath to turn over economic decision-making power
to an international organization of any kind. The Clinton
administration is also doubtful about the wisdom of creating a new
bureaucracy to police the world economy.

LOSING RIVERA ARBITRATION PUTS YANKEES DOWN $3.05 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: See also Yanks-Clemens, Yanks-Compete, Yanks-Fans,
Yanks-Wells, Yanks-Deal) 
(DW) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York Yankee players, as opposed to Yankee management, have
carried their 1998 success into 1999. Mariano Rivera, the team's
closer, Thursday joined shortstop Derek Jeter as a winner in salary
arbitration. The Yankees are the only team that has lost in the
first eight arbitration decisions, and George Steinbrenner was said
to be furious.
</P>
<P>
   No surprise there, but the arbitration cases have rudely altered
the charmed life Brian Cashman lived as a rookie general manager
last year. Not only did the Yankees lose both cases, but Cashman
also rejected proposed settlements from the agents for both players
before their hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera, who like Jeter played under a renewed contract with a
$750,000 salary last year, won a $4.25 million salary in the
decision by the arbitrator, James Duff, instead of the Yankees'
preferred salary of $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Yankees will pay their arbitration players a
combined $3.05 million more than they wanted, bringing their
payroll to $84 million for 19 signed players. If Darryl
Strawberry's $2.5 million salary is added _ he has a minor league
contract until he proves he is healthy enough to play _ the payroll
reaches $86.5 million. The Yankees are expected to compete with
Baltimore and Los Angeles for the highest payroll in the major
leagues this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, as it turned out, could have saved some money. In
Jeter's case, they rejected a last-minute offer from his agent,
Casey Close, to settle at the midpoint, $4.1 million. Had they
agreed, the Yankees would have saved $900,000.
</P>
<P>
   Just before Rivera's hearing Wednesday morning in Tampa, Fla.,
Jim Bronner and Bob Gilhooley, his agents, proposed a $3.9 million
salary, but the Yankees said no. They will now pay $350,000 more.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got to the hearing, they asked us to stay outside for
a few minutes,'' Bronner said. ``They were talking to George on the
phone. Then when we walked into the room, they said no.''
</P>
<P>
   Cashman said the settlement rejections were his decisions. ``The
bottom line,'' he said in Tampa, ``is you make decisions, and
you're right sometimes and you're wrong sometimes. These were two
costly decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   The arbitrators' decisions will likely be costly for Frank
Casey, the lawyer who argued the cases for the Yankees. Casey, an
arbitration veteran, has been successful more often than not and,
in fact, won two previous cases he argued this month, for Montreal
against Shane Andrews and for Kansas City against Johnny Damon. But
chances are the Yankees will have a different representative next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Although arbitrators do not explain the reasons for their
rulings, once the Yankees lost the Jeter case, it might have
undermined their argument against Rivera. The club had paid the
players comparable salaries their first three years, and Duff might
not have bought their argument that now they deserved drastically
different salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Cashman said he would look for ways to cut the payroll. Most
likely to go, if the Yankees could make deals for them, would be
Chad Curtis, who starts a 3-year, $6 million contract, and Darren
Holmes, a reliever owed a guaranteed $3.45 million for the next two
years. &QL;

IF THE GRASS IS GREENER 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 21) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHELLE COTTLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Q. I am expecting a job offer that would mean higher pay.
Otherwise, I prefer my present job. Of course, I hope that my
current employer, once told of the offer, will meet or beat it. How
can I get what I want, while still being fair to both sides?
</P>
<P>
   A. No matter how much you love the one you're with, it's always
nice to know that you're desirable to others. But before bringing
this outside flirtation to the attention of your current boss, you
need to get a sense of how he or she handles jealousy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Determine the history of how your boss _ or whoever the
decision maker is _ responds to alternative offers,'' said Robin
Pinkley, chairman of the department of organizational behavior and
business policy at the Cox School of Business at Southern Methodist
University.
</P>
<P>
   The responses generally fall into two categories. Some employers
see such offers as evidence of your worth; no matter how successful
you are in your job, it takes outside evidence to make them realize
your value.
</P>
<P>
   If your bosses fall into this group, Ms. Pinkley advised, ``tell
them you have been made an alternative offer but that the truth is
you prefer to stay.'' Be specific about your reasons: good working
relationships, cultural fit, loyalty, growth opportunities and so
on. Then point out delicately that, while pay is not the most
important factor, you have an obligation to your family and your
long-term future to be compensated in a way that reflects your
value.
</P>
<P>
   With other bosses, however, you might have to tread even more
carefully. ``Another kind of employer tends to view an alternative
offer as a statement of your lack of commitment and loyalty _ as a
slap in the face,'' Ms. Pinkley warned.
</P>
<P>
   If that is the case, make it very clear that you prefer to
remain, and that you may well do so even if you don't get more
money. ``Say, however, that you would stay more happily _ you would
be delighted _ if they would use this as an opportunity to
re-evaluate the value you bring the company,'' Ms. Pinkley said.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what kind of boss you have, and no matter how strong
your workplace relationships, you should proceed with extreme
caution, said Jose Oller, a partner at LAI World Wide, an executive
recruiting firm based in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   He recommended framing the subject as a request for advice, not
as a threat to leave. ``Say: `I've been approached for this and
they're offering more money. What do you suggest?' ''
</P>
<P>
   To insure the company a return on its greater investment, Ms.
Pinkley suggested writing a list of goals, with your added pay to
be contingent on meeting them.
</P>
<P>
   But don't start the discussion without a plan for what to do if
the boss refuses a raise. ``Be ready to walk or to tell your boss,
`Hey, I like working here and am going to stay,' '' Oller advised.
``Don't leave things hanging once your boss knows the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Above all, he warned, don't bring up anything until you have a
hard offer from your suitor. ``These things have gone south at the
altar many, many times,'' he said.

A SPEECH WE'LL NEVER HEAR FROM ALAN GREENSPAN  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 21)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ (italics)Despite his reputation for deliberate
opacity, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, actually
speaks quite directly about the outlook for the economy and
interest rates. Still, there may be limits to any Fed chairman's
forthrightness. Rest assured that when he goes before the Senate
Banking Committee on Tuesday for the first round of this year's
Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, he will not say the following, no
matter how much he might want to.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thank you. I always enjoy this opportunity to indulge members of
Congress in the fantasy that they understand monetary policy, and
to prepare Wall Street for the next trick up my sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start by reviewing 1998. You might remember me saying in
September that no nation could remain an oasis of prosperity
unaffected by what was going on in the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Boy, was I wrong! Japan remains in the tank, and the rest of
Asia is only starting to breathe on its own. Emerging economies
from Russia to Brazil are already in free fall or teetering on the
brink. Europe is doing nothing to help, and may itself be headed
for a downward slide. Yet the American economy is not only
shrugging off the rest of the world's woes, it is also showing
remarkable strength.
</P>
<P>
   The economic growth rate in the fourth quarter _ 5.6 percent,
annualized _ may wind up being revised downward somewhat. But
heading into 1999 the United States was not just an oasis, it was a
veritable economic Garden of Eden.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of sin, I'll confess to my own. That last interest rate
cut _ the quarter-point reduction in the federal funds and discount
rates in November _ was a mistake. The economy certainly didn't
need it. And while I'm sure my central-banker friends around the
world appreciated it, its main effect at home was to send stocks
higher.
</P>
<P>
   I really should have held off, keeping that quarter point in my
ammo belt just in case Brazil melts down or some other
conflagration breaks out in the global financial system, and we
need another shot of monetary easing. Now, if I have to cut rates
further, Wall Street is going to spurt up into cloud-cuckoo-land.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows my feelings about equity valuations, but let me
try this one more time: You people are bonkers if you think
earnings are going to hold up over the next year, much less
increase at a double-digit pace. So if you're buying on the basis
of price-to-earnings multiples, stop deluding yourselves _ you're
all day traders now.
</P>
<P>
   Since we central bankers have to consider all the possibilities,
let's look at another: that growth remains so strong this year that
the hawks start agitating for a rate increase to head off any
chance of inflation taking root.
</P>
<P>
   Raising rates now, while there are no signs of inflation to
speak of, would bring the wrath of the business establishment down
on me and make the Fed a political issue heading into the 2000
election. I'm willing to take the heat for a tough call if
necessary. But we might have been able to avoid the need for
tighter policy if we had just stayed pat last fall after the first
two quarter-point rate cuts, which left the Fed funds target rate
at 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the question of how investors would respond to
even a small rate increase. One thing I've learned is that it is
impossible to let the air out of a stock market bubble slowly. When
this thing goes, it could well explode with a bang that will hit
the real economy hard.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? Even a small rate increase at the wrong time could
set off a chain reaction that we would regret deeply.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, that's one reason you are all listening so attentively
for any sign that we see a need for tightening later this year. The
monetarists on the Open Market Committee are already pressing for
us to adopt a tightening bias, and with some justification.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillips Curve crowd, led by Larry Meyer, keeps asking how
long our streak of good luck on inflation will last, and they have
a point. There has to come a day when all the world's economic
winds will not chance to blow our way at the same time. Oil prices
will not remain depressed forever. The dollar could weaken, or
global demand could recover; either would drive up the prices we
pay for imported goods. And eventually it will dawn on workers that
they now have the upper hand and can demand higher pay. Even I
don't think we can sustain a 4 percent annual growth rate and a 4.3
percent unemployment rate forever without seeing wages and prices
start creeping higher.
</P>
<P>
   But this economy has proved remarkably resilient, and I am
inclined to bet that we can make it at least until summer without a
compelling need for a rate increase.
</P>
<P>
   No guarantees, now _ the potential for surprises, both happy and
nasty, is too great. But with inflation virtually nonexistent,
we've got an opportunity to be patient, and plenty of time to react
if wage and price pressures start to build.
</P>
<P>
   So until things break one way or the other, we're on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Any questions?

TEXAS SENATE PASSES BILL TO END SOCIAL PROMOTIONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A cornerstone of Gov. George W. Bush's
``compassionate conservative'' agenda, a bill to end social
promotions of failing students, gained unanimous approval Thursday
from the Texas Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate agreed, 31-0, to an estimated $203 million plan to
end the practice of promoting Texas students solely for social
reasons while making sure they get early extra help to overcome
their problems. The first children eligible for extra help will
enter kindergarten this fall and will be the first subject to
retention when they hit third grade.
</P>
<P>
   The bipartisan-backed bill now heads to the House where it faces
a less certain future and is expected to undergo questions about
the adequacy of its funding and how the minority students most
affected will fare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today the Senate sent a strong message that no child will be
left behind in our state, that when a child is identified with a
reading deficiency we'll correct it early before it's too late,''
said Bush, who thanked legislators for ``doing what's right for the
schoolchildren of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes would not affect children already in school but
Texas' next crop of kindergartners would undergo screenings to
identify which show early signs of reading difficulties. Remedial
help would begin at once for those children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is designed to focus on these children in the entering
class of 1999 and say to them we're not going to let you fall
through the cracks like your older brothers and sisters have,''
said Sen. Teel Bivins, R-Amarillo, who sponsored the key education
initiative as chairman of the Senate Education Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't atone for all of our past sins but we can start today
to address this critical issue of social promotion,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, fifth and eighth grades, students who could not
pass the Texas Academic Assessment Test after three tries would be
held back a year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, under one compromise the bill underwent on its way to
passage, a committee made up of the child's parent, teacher and
principal could decide against holding the child back. Even so, the
student would continue to take extra, remedial classes for reading
and in later years also math and writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to dramatically reduce the number of children
promoted even though they have failed the test, Bivins said. ``If
the school decides that child needs help, Senate Bill 1 is designed
to get that child help.''
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1997, he said, 42,000 _ more than one-fifth of
Texas third-graders _ failed the TAAS, yet more than 90 percent of
them were promoted anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rene Oliveira, D-Brownsville, who sits on the House Public
Education Committee, said he met with Bush and his staff Wednesday
to discuss the bill and its effects on minority students. Of the
38,000 failing children promoted in 1997, he said, 43 percent were
Hispanic and 25 percent African-American.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's long overdue, and the governor deserves credit for
putting it in the forefront of the education agenda. For too long
we've turned a blind eye to it, and we should be ashamed,''
Oliveira said, noting the quality of the early detection and
remedial instruction is critical. ``If we fail there, the whole
thing breaks down.''
</P>
<P>
   Senators questioned whether $203 million, including an expected
emergency appropriation of $18.8 million to train kindergarten
teachers this summer, is enough to do the job right. They adopted
an amendment by Sen. Royce West, D-Dallas, aimed at releasing
school districts from carrying out the program if it turns out to
be a ``legislative fad'' and gets inadequate funding in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The bill has drawn support from teachers' groups, including the
Texas Federation of Teachers, an organized labor union, which
applauded its passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill goes a long way toward ensuring that all Texas
schoolchildren will be reading by third grade,'' said federation
President John Cole. ``We are gratified the bill received such
strong bipartisan support today.''
</P>
<P>
   House Public Education Chairman Paul Sadler, D-Henderson, said
he will sponsor the bill in the House where he expects it will
undergo considerably more scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate always unanimously adopts everything,'' he said.
``The votes are rarely unanimous in the House. We're going to
examine all the issues. We're not going to accept it on blind
faith. We're going to debate and we're going to change quite a
number of things would be my guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Harold Dutton, D-Houston, said House members must ask why
social promotion evolved in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``My problem is with the whole bill and the whole premise of the
bill. When you start looking at social promotion, the question
somebody has to answer is why do we have social promotion and is it
a good idea to have a 13-year-old in the third grade?'' he said.
``I think the problem is we don't provide the right learning
environment. I'm not one that believes that teachers can't teach
and students can't learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Dutton's answer to ending social promotion? A bill he's going to
push to lower the student-teacher ratio to 10-1 through the third
grade.

LABOR FORUM GIVES SOCIAL SECURITY ALERT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (js) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI BEACH, Fla. _ If Republicans and business lobbyists want
to know why it might be hard to push their Social Security
proposals through Congress, they need look no further than a forum,
much like a revival meeting, that was held here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO sponsored a forum on Social Security that was packed
with more than 500 people, from white-haired retired teachers to
brawny bricklayers, and the unmistakable message was touch Social
Security at your peril.
</P>
<P>
   Union organizers gave out hundreds of Save Social Security
postcards to mail to Congress, and urged the union faithful to rope
their friends into the campaign to stop a partial privatization of
the retirement program. The 500 retirees and rank and file at the
forum may not have much effect by themselves, but with the AFL-CIO
planning 50 such meetings across the country over the next two
months, unions are guaranteeing they will have a loud voice,
perhaps the loudest voice, in this year's high-stakes debate on
revamping Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously they're very formidable,'' said Leanne Abdnor,
executive director of the Alliance for Worker Retirement Security,
the main business lobbying group promoting changes to shore up
Social Security financing. ``Anybody who thinks otherwise is
foolish.''
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders, gathered here for the AFL-CIO's winter meeting,
seem to relish a fight over a retirement program that unions have
revered since it was created under Franklin D. Roosevelt. Those
commentators who say it will be boring to leave impeachment behind
and focus on an arcane issue like Social Security have evidently
forgotten to convey that message to organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   Having largely sat on the sidelines during the impeachment tug
of war, unions see the Social Security struggle as a welcome
vehicle to mobilize members and to throw Republicans on the
defensive this year and next. All this dovetails neatly with
organized labor's strategy to engage the grass roots to help the
Democrats win the White House and recapture Congress next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're finding these meetings to be really very successful in
educating the members,'' said John J. Sweeney, president of the
labor federation. ``And it's helping us in terms of building a
grass-roots mobilization around this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Unions vehemently oppose proposals put forward by business to
partly privatize Social Security by setting up personal retirement
investment accounts. Some business lobbyists reluctantly give labor
most of the credit for President Clinton's decision not to propose
devoting a portion of Social Security taxes to these personal
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Labor also opposes proposals to raise to 70, from the current
65, the age at which people would receive full benefits. Proposals
like raising the retirement age are intended to help eliminate the
large-scale deficits forecast for the Social Security system in
three decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in construction for 33 years, and it's not an easy
trade,'' Frank Mascari, a member of the operating engineers union,
said in a segment when rank-and-file workers were invited to speak.
``When you're a young man, you think you can do it without any
problems. After a while your body breaks down. It let's you know it
can't do it anymore. Let's not even talk about raising the Social
Security age to 70. Let's lower it, if anything.''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Mascari said this, at least a dozen union members
shouted, ``Amen.'' Many members of the audience acted as if
altering Social Security would be to destroy something sacred.
</P>
<P>
   To help remedy the system's financing problems, labor favors a
proposal that enrages Republicans: it wants to increase the $72,600
cap above which Americans no longer have to pay Social Security
taxes. It also favors President Clinton's proposal to set aside 62
percent of the budget surplus and channel it into the Social
Security trust fund, an idea the Republican leadership has
embraced.
</P>
<P>
   One of labor's main targets is the Republican proposal for an
across-the-board cut in income tax. That money, union leaders say,
should be used to help finance Medicare, which faces a deficit.
</P>
<P>
   To immense applause at the forum, Richard Trumka, the labor
federation's secretary-treasurer, said, ``Budget surpluses should
be used to save Social Security and Medicare first, not to pay for
tax cuts for the rich, who don't need their taxes cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Help us defend these principles,'' Trumka said. ``America
needs you and needs Social Security benefits guaranteed for life.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With many unions convinced that the stock market is too risky,
labor is divided over the president's proposal to invest part of
the Social Security trust fund in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abdnor, whose business lobbying group is promoting changes,
faulted unions for advancing many criticisms and few solutions. She
asserted that union members disagree with their leaders' opposition
to placing Social Security money into personal retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ought to let workers make the choice,'' she said.
``They're smart enough to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But union leaders attack such accounts, saying administrative
costs would be high, reducing the amount available for benefits.
They also say that many Americans would manage their money poorly
and see their investments plummet, leaving them without a
retirement safety net.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abdnor insisted that even with commissions, most Americans
would end up with more money for retirement because over time
stocks have generally risen far more than bonds, in which Social
Security is now invested.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Reardon, a tax lobbyist for the National Federation of
Independent Business, which represents 600,000 small businesses,
acknowledged that corporations might need to borrow a page from
labor in mobilizing the masses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business community needs to begin to focus on not only the
policy aspect, but also the grass-roots aspect,'' Reardon said.
``If not, this debate will be over before it begins.''

3 GREEK OFFICIALS REMOVED OVER REBEL KURD'S CAPTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece _ Seeking to contain a growing scandal over
Greece's role in the capture of a Kurdish rebel leader, Prime
Minister Costas Simitis has replaced his foreign minister and two
other Cabinet members.
</P>
<P>
   George Papandreou, son of Greece's former prime minister,
Andreas Papandreou, who died in 1996, will replace Foreign Minister
Theodoros Pangalos, who has been assigned most of the blame in the
government for what is being called ``the fiasco'' here.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, government officials gave their explanation of how
Greece had come to secretly harbor the Kurdish leader, Abdullah
Ocalan, and then was unable to protect him from Turkish security
forces.
</P>
<P>
   A deputy foreign minister known as mild-mannered and moderate,
Papandreou did not hide his dismay over the government's bungled
diplomacy. ``By whatever mistakes, Greece has partial
responsibility for turning Ocalan over to Turkey,'' he said.
``There is an obvious feeling of humiliation in public opinion that
has to be recognized.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrest of Ocalan, who was under Greek protection in Nairobi
until he was seized by Turkish agents, was devastating to most
Greeks, who sympathize with the Kurdish cause or at least share the
Kurds' animosity for the Greeks' historic enemies, the Turks.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, 10,000 people demonstrated here in support of
Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers Party and against the Greek government's
actions, and Greek television repeatedly showed images of Ocalan
being blindfolded by his Turkish captors.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism of what the government did _ or failed to do _ is
unlikely to subside easily. The Ocalan affair could worsen already
tense relations between Greece and Turkey. And its repercussions at
home will certainly not help Simitis' contested effort to trim
Greece's economy and qualify for membership in the European Union's
single currency by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Simitis, whose popularity was already lagging, has said little
since Ocalan was taken to Turkey. As departing government officials
gave scattered details Thursday of how Greece had become saddled
with Ocalan, offering him secret support while frantically seeking
to get rid of him, a poignant but not exactly flattering image of
Greek diplomacy emerged.
</P>
<P>
   After Ocalan's capture on Monday, enraged Kurdish protesters
occupied Greek diplomatic posts all over the world to protest what
they initially viewed as Greece's betrayal of the Kurdish leader.
</P>
<P>
   The government's muddled explanation _ that it had sought a safe
haven for Ocalan, but was duped by Ocalan, the Kenyan government
and the Turks _ was just as hurtful to Greek national pride.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Alekos Papadopoulos and Public Order Minister
Philippos Petsalnikos were replaced by Vasso Papandreou _ no
relation to the new foreign minister _ and Michalis Chrysohoidis.
</P>
<P>
   The departing foreign minister, Pangalos, told reporters at a
farewell news conference that Ocalan had twice secretly entered
Greece after he was expelled from Italy at the end of January. The
first visit, when he arrived from Russia, was unannounced and
unwelcome, according to Pangalos.
</P>
<P>
   A retired Greek admiral, Andonis Naxakis, a member of a group of
hard-line conservatives who favor Kurdish self-rule in Turkey, said
he had invited Ocalan to Greece and spirited him in on a private
plane. Ocalan's supporters misled Greek airport officials by saying
the Kurdish leader was a Russian official, government officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time, he entered Greece without anyone knowing,''
Pangalos said. ``I will tell you frankly, as the prime minister has
said, we did not want Ocalan in Greece.''
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan was in fact a greater diplomatic danger to Greece than to
any of the other European countries that shunned him. While Greeks,
and particularly the Socialist government of Simitis, embraced the
Kurdish cause, any overt sign of real support to Ocalan would have
come close to a declaration of war with Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Greece has long pleaded with the European Union to take up the
Kurdish cause and help Greece out of its quandary. Among government
officials, there was deep bitterness about what they saw as
Europe's lack of courage.
</P>
<P>
   Naxakis had alerted the government to Ocalan's presence, and
government officials said Thursday that Greek security forces
escorted him to a plane and began searching for a country willing
to take him.
</P>
<P>
   After he was denied entry into Rotterdam, Netherlands, then
Minsk, Belarus, his plane refueled on the Greek island of Corfu,
and he was then sent to the Greek Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, for 12
days while Greece searched for another destination in Africa. At
the time, Greece denied that it was giving Ocalan refuge.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan's capture, according to Pangalos, was his own fault. The
former prime minister said that foreign intelligence services
picked up his trail by tracking Ocalan's mobile phone by satellite.
``He started talking to the whole world,'' Pangalos said. ``Big
secret services have satellites recording all mobile phones.''
</P>
<P>
   Pangalos said Ocalan refused to move to another, less detectable
area of Kenya and instead made his own arrangements with Kenyan
authorities to go to the airport. En route, Ocalan's car vanished
from the Kenyan government convoy, snatched by Turkish security
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Many Greeks expressed skepticism about the government's
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it's as obvious as the sun: Greece made a deal with
Turkey,'' said Nicholas Geralis, a 49-year-old Greek cargo ship
captain. ``Politics are very dirty and very deep. They are never
going to say what really happened.''

TALES OF FEAR AND LOATHING OF MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Wash.)   (af)  
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Using internal company documents and sworn
depositions at the Microsoft trial Thursday, a government lawyer
depicted Compaq Computer Corp., the world's largest manufacturer of
personal computers, as so fearful of Microsoft that it repeatedly
abandoned software products it preferred in favor of Microsoft's
offerings and even passed on information about a competing
operating system in violation of a nondisclosure agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``In regard to browsers,'' one internal memo stated in May 1996,
``our goal is to feature the brand leader, Netscape.'' But in an
e-mail written at almost the same time, a Compaq employee wrote,
``Microsoft is unhappy with the Netscape icon on the desktop and
wants to get it off.'' He added, ``Microsoft's stance to date
raises questions of improper use of their monopoly position.''
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, Compaq signed an agreement making Internet
Explorer, Microsoft's browser, the default choice on all Compaq
personal computers. That happened even though Celeste Dunn, who was
in charge of buying software, had cautioned other executives that
to comply with Microsoft's request, Compaq would have to
``significantly alter'' a line of computers, ``revise its business
model and jeopardize two profitable, revenue generating contracts''
worth $9 million.
</P>
<P>
   That exchange was just one in a cascade of disclosures that
David Boies, the government's lead trial lawyer, made in court
Thursday. They offered an extraordinary look inside the
relationship between two powerful companies that are, as one Compaq
document described it, ``joined at the hip.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft promises a rebuttal when its lawyers question the
witness on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Siekman, general counsel for Compaq, insisted in an intervew
that ``our relationship with Microsoft is one of equal partners; we
are not the weak sister.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, in court Thursday, the testimony of John T. Rose, a
Compaq senior vice president, contradicted that of numerous other
Compaq employees.
</P>
<P>
   He is the only representative of the computer manufacturing
industry to appear in court. Microsoft held high hopes that he
would counteract the government's assertion that Microsoft's main
customers _ manufacturers of personal computers _ fear the company
and consider it a bully.
</P>
<P>
   But Rose seemed generally out of touch. He said he had never
seen or heard of most of the contracts, discussions and product
proposals that were presented to him. The disconnect was so extreme
that at one point Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson noted that Rose had
disagreed with everything another senior employee had said in a
deposition. ``And I'm just wondering who speaks with authority for
the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose insisted that he did.
</P>
<P>
   In the most dramatic discloure in court Thursday, Boies asked
Rose if he was aware that Compaq had received confidential product
information from Be Inc., a tiny company that makes a niche
operating system, and had passed it on to Microsoft in violation of
a nondisclosure agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Rose said he was not aware of this, and Compaq's lawyer, William
Costen, leaped from his bench to declaim Boies' raising the issue
in court to ``sully the company with this information.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Thursday evening, Jean Claude Gassee,
chief executive of Be, said: ``In November, a Compaq executive
called me, rather embarrassed, to say that someone had
inadvertantly leaked some information from us to a company in
Redmond,'' the Seattle suburb where Microsoft has its headquarters.
``He was very embarrassed, but my interpretation is that this is a
result of the climate of fear Microsoft creates.''
</P>
<P>
   Boies offered several documents suggesting that Compaq's fear of
Microsoft was longstanding. A document titled ``Microsoft meeting
presentation,'' dated January 1993, postulates Microsoft's
``potential reactions'' to Compaq's decision to use another
company's software for personal digital assistants. ``How
retaliatory will they get?'' it asks, then lists 14 ways Microsoft
could hurt Compaq, including ``selection and elevation of other''
computer manufacturers ``as leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Boies then produced a letter dated three months later in which
Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, congratulated Compaq's chief
executive for selecting ``Microsoft as the exclusive supplier of
operating system software for your hand-held computers.'' What
occurred in those three months was not described.
</P>
<P>
   Another e-mail between senior Compaq executives helped to
explain why Compaq dropped Netscape Communications' browser for
Internet Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft was upset with our internal use of Netscape and
initiated a number of activities with Digital Equipment Company and
Hewlett-Packard, reducing their emphasis on the Compaq
partnership,'' the executive wrote. Compaq responded, she added, by
agreeing to include Microsoft's software for the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Boies also presented memos showing that a Compaq executive had
agreed in 1997 to make ``side agreements'' with Microsoft, ``given
Microsoft's concern that the agreements are defensible'' with other
manufacturers ``and the Department of Justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Boies offered two such agreements signed on the same day and
described them as the public agreement and ``the real agreement.''
Details of the two contracts were not disclosed, but Rose said he
was not familiar with either of them.
</P>
<P>
   Boies closed Thursday's cross-examination by reading from an
e-mail message from a Microsoft official who was the Compaq account
manager in 1995, shortly after Microsoft reached a consent
agreement with the government on an earlier antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   In it, Microsoft promised to stop forcing PC makers to buy one
copy of a Microsoft operating system for every computer sold and
instead charge them only for every computer on which the operating
system was installed.
</P>
<P>
   In the e-mail, the Microsoft manager wrote that despite the
consent agreement, few manufacturers had chosen to renegotiate
their contracts with Microsoft. And if Compaq chose to do so, ``it
would be a major issue at Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose said he had never seen this memo, either.

 &HT;    Dell now considering option of sub-$1,000 PC market
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROUND ROCK, Texas _ Up to now, Dell Computer Corp., the fastest
growing personal computer company, has chosen not to compete in the
sub-$1,000 PC market, the industry's fastest growing segment.
</P>
<P>
   The company has proudly explained for more than a year that
because it is growing so fast and so profitably, it has the
``luxury'' of picking in which markets it will compete.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after a disappointing revenue report Tuesday and a sell-off
of Dell stock, top executives say they are considering selling
lower-cost PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Dell stock, which had fallen from $108 a share since
Feb. 11, recovered $1.43 3/4 to $83 in Nasdaq trading.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the company's recent registration of the Internet
domain name dellauction.com has sparked speculation about a new
Internet business.
</P>
<P>
   While Dell matched Wall Street's expectations with
fourth-quarter earnings per share of 31 cents, its revenue growth
of 36 percent was the first time in four years that it fell below
50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Chief Executive Michael Dell and chief financial
officer Tom Meredith told Wall Street analysts the company was
considering offering a sub-$1,000 PC.
</P>
<P>
   PaineWebber analyst Don Young said he expects Dell to launch
such a model for the back-to-school season, possibly as part of a
more aggressive push into the consumer business.
</P>
<P>
   ``This move could be an indication that Dell is being pushed
towards less attractive segments in order to sustain its high
growth rate,'' Young said in a report issued after Dell's quarterly
results were announced.
</P>
<P>
   But that would put pressure on Dell's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent they get into that space, it's going to bring
(average selling prices) and gross margins down,'' said Van Baker,
director of consumer market research for Dataquest.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result, it's going to squeeze the net margin.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell spokesman T.R. Reid said that with improved, low-cost
processors, including Intel Corp.'s latest Celeron chip, the
profitability of low-end PCs may be changing along with their
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be able to build a way to play in there with some
profitability,'' Reid said. ``We're not interested in revenue per
se, or market share per se, certainly not without a satisfactory
return for our investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Compaq Computer Corp., the first to introduce a sub-$1,000 PC,
says the business is profitable. But analysts say that's partly
because Compaq and the other leaders in that business, Gateway, IBM
and Hewlett-Packard Co., don't make the computers
</P>
<P>
   They get their machines from low-cost manufacturers such as
Acer, Synnex and Solectron, said Bill Schaub, vice president of
consumer research at Dataquest.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never touch the box,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Dell, with its industry-leading ability to turn its
inventory in six days, would be stretched to match that efficiency,
Schaub said.
</P>
<P>
   Because consumers account for less than 15 percent of Dell's
business, having no low-cost PC doesn't adequately explain Dell's
revenue slowdown in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Dell executives said the company lost large corporate deals to
Compaq, IBM and others because it misread how much the cost of
components would fall and, therefore, it priced its products too
high.
</P>
<P>
   Dell executives and analysts agree that Dell will rebound in
that business in the current quarter, the first of its 2000 fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, some analysts aren't convinced Dell will enter the
sub-$1,000 market in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really get a sense that it is something they would be
going straight into,'' said Schelley Olhava of IDC. ``They're
investigating it.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview five days before Dell released earnings, Michael
Dell was asked whether the company had plans to branch off its
current product line.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said. ``Not big changes there.''
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has announced partnerships with Internet
service providers and cable companies in recent months, plans to
announce a new offering next week in San Francisco. That, and the
company's registration of dellauction.com, has fueled speculation
about an Internet-related business.
</P>
<P>
   Reid said Dell had no immediate plans for such a site. He said
the company registered the name to reserve it for possible use
later.

   LOS ANGELES _ The agony of defeat can be greedy.
</P>
<P>
   Tagging the Los Angeles Clippers with six losses in as many
games isn't enough; now the NBA's only winless team must prepare
for Saturday's game against Dallas with two wounded guards.
</P>
<P>
   Backup point guard Sherman Douglas has retained the familiar
``day-to-day'' tag, thanks to a left-groin injury sustained during
Tuesday's double-overtime loss to the Vancouver Grizzlies. Douglas,
who contributed 9 points and 4 assists in that game, participated
in a few light drills during Thursday's practice at Veterans Park
Sports Complex in Carson.
</P>
<P>
   According to Coach Chris Ford, team doctors are optimistic about
Douglas' chances of playing Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Piatkowski, the Clippers' starting shooting guard, attended
the workout, but didn't participate. His gremlin? A jammed right
ankle that achieved its current state of tenderness during a
rebound battle in the Vancouver game.
</P>
<P>
   Piatkowski is expected to practice today.
</P>
<P>
   `Go time' for someone: According to a league rule, the Clippers
must trim their active roster to 12 players by 3 p.m. (PST) today.
Of course, they also are allowed to stash three bodies on the
injured list, so this means they can continue paying 15 players.
</P>
<P>
   They currently have 16 on the payroll. Veteran free-agent guard
Scott Brooks (knee) and rookie Brian Skinner (knee) are occupying
two of the injured-list spots, although Skinner did some light
running Thursday and is expected to make his pro debut soon.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a trade or the waiver claim of a castaway selected from
the other 56 players who will be available, the Clippers must ship
out one player.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still looking at possibilities,'' Ford said. ``We've
been discussing it all along. I don't know if there'll be any
trades.''
</P>
<P>
   `Mo' better rebounding: Maurice Taylor's 20-rebound effort
against Vancouver ranks as the best glass-cleaning job he's turned
in since his days at Ford High (named in honor of Henry, not Chris)
in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Young ``Mo'' collected 36 rebounds during a game against
Southfield High, ``But high school doesn't count,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He does admit to taking pride in his career high at Michigan, an
18-rebound performance against Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember that rebound starting a fast break,'' Taylor said.
``Bobby Knight ran out on the court. I was scared; I thought he was
comin' for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Brewer's back: Assistant coach Jim Brewer, who missed three
games due to a family illness, was at Thursday's practice. Brewer
spent the last several days in the Chicago area to be with his
father who had suffered a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer, who was a high school All-American at Proviso East High
in Maywood, Ill., said his father's condition has improved
considerably.

 &HT;    Bowles' optionsare open in North Carolina
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charlotte _ If former White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles
ever grows tired of investment banking, or if he can resist the
itch to run for public office, he's got a standing invitation on
the North Carolina coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could come down here and fry shrimp with me,'' said Nags
Head restaurateur R.V. Owens, an influential state Democrat who
counts himself among Bowles' new friends.
</P>
<P>
   Owens' encounter with Bowles seems to erase one of the question
marks about the 53-year-old Charlotte businessman's return to North
Carolina after spending five of the last six years in Washington.
People wondered whether somebody with so much money, so many
high-brow credentials and such close connections to an impeached
president could succeed in politics in a Bible Belt state where
candidates stump for votes over soppy plates of barbecue and hush
puppies.
</P>
<P>
   But a bigger question lingers. What are Bowles' political plans
now, after he announced in December that he would not run for
governor next year?
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a player whether he wants to be or not,'' said Thad
Woodard, president of the North Carolina Bankers Association in
Raleigh. ``Whenever anybody does his math, he is part of the
political equation.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-seven years ago, Woodard drove the campaign car for
Bowles' father, who lost the governor's race to Jim Holshouser.
Holshouser became North Carolina's first Republican governor this
century in a stunning political upset that many Democrats had hoped
to avenge with Erskine Bowles' homecoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are those of us who would come running to him if he were
to get in the governor's race,'' Woodard said. ``But I do not know
that he ever will.''
</P>
<P>
   Pundits are especially intrigued by the prospect of a
bare-knuckled U.S. Senate race in 2002 between Bowles, a diehard
Democrat toting the baggage of the Clinton administration, and the
longtime incumbent, conservative Republican Jesse Helms, who is
notorious for blistering campaign ads.
</P>
<P>
   Bowles said he isn't considering any political race at the
moment. But people listen closely for any hint of his political
intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Owens had been so nervous about meeting Bowles last month that
he changed outfits three times before the millionaire investment
banker picked him up in a private plane. But by the end of the
evening, during which they talked about politics, hunting,
basketball and their fathers, Owens concluded what many others had
about Bowles: ``He would have made a great governor,'' Owens said,
even though he has long been a supporter of North Carolina
Democratic Attorney General Mike Easley in the 2000 gubernatorial
race.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent interview in the 24th-floor offices of Carousel
Capital, the Charlotte merchant bank that he rejoined in January,
Bowles said he was ``positive ... no question in my mind'' that he
could win the governor's office in 2000. But, he said, his wife,
mother, sister and his three grown children objected to his
running.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is tough to be on public display all of the time,'' said
Jessamine Bowles, Bowles' mother who lives in Greensboro. She
remembers how exhausting it was campaigning for her now-deceased
husband, Hargrove ``Skipper'' Bowles, who ran in 1972. The couple
divorced after the election. ``You are always reluctant to see
someone you love take on something so strenuous.''
</P>
<P>
   A successful businessman until his death in 1986, Skipper Bowles
parlayed money from his wife's family into real estate and other
ventures. In the early 1980s, he spearheaded the raising of more
than $34 million for the construction of the Dean E. Smith Arena at
the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, his alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because he's not seeking office, Erskine Bowles' views
are frank and unapologetic on topics ranging from the president's
affair with Monica Lewinsky to the administration's attack on
cigarette makers, which have operations in North Carolina and buy
tobacco from the state's farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies deserved to be tough on,'' he said. ``You go
back and read some of the things in these files, and it will turn
your stomach. Do I believe they were deceptive? Do I believe they
marketed to kids? Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Lewinsky affair, Bowles said Clinton deserves censure,
not removal from office, for his ``grossly inappropriate affair''
with the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody, including the president, approved of what he did,''
Bowles said. ``It is inexcusable.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then he did every single thing that he could do that was
humanly possible to keep it a secret,'' Bowles said, ``a secret
from me, from the other members of the Cabinet, from the White
House staff, from his wife, from his child and from the American
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't believe that it rises to the level that the
Founding Fathers had in mind when they talked about overturning the
will of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   If he were to run for office, Bowles said, he believes his
opponents would attack him on tobacco and the president's affair
with Lewinsky, even though he wasn't at the White House when it
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Bowles dismissed the suggestion that he might yet enter the
North Carolina's governor's race if the Democratic candidates get
off to a lackadaisical start. ``I haven't thought about changing my
mind,'' Bowles said. ``I have kind of put that behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   How about a run for the U.S. Senate or for the governor's office
in 2004? ``Anything is possible,'' he said, ``but it is not
something I'm spending two seconds thinking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Bowles joined one of America's best-known buyout
firms, Forstmann Little &AMP; Co. in New York, as general partner. At
the same time, he returned to Carousel Capital in Charlotte. Both
firms specialize in investing in companies or buying them outright,
improving their operations, and selling them for a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Bowles said he's comfortable jumping from business to politics
and back to business. ``You've got to go out where the people are,
just like you do in politics,'' he said. ``It's the same thing;
it's just a different market.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowles moved to Charlotte in 1972, started an investment bank
and raised three children with his wife, the former Crandall Close.
An heir to the Spring Industries textile fortune in South Carolina,
she is now chief executive of the Fort Mill, S.C.-based company.
</P>
<P>
   Bowles hosted a fund-raiser in Charlotte for Clinton in 1992,
several months before he was elected president. Bowles moved to
Washington in 1993 as director of the Small Business
Administration, later becoming deputy White House chief of staff
and a confidant and golfing pal of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Bowles returned to Charlotte in 1995, only to return to
Washington as White House chief of staff after Clinton's
re-election in November 1996. He accepted the job for $1 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, swept up in speculation that he would run for
governor, Bowles traveled around North Carolina. In phone calls and
meetings with prominent Democrats, he sifted through the state's
problems and assessed his chances. He concluded that he could raise
the $8 million to $10 million he thought it would take to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the choice had been simply mine, I would probably have run
this time,'' Bowles said. ``I felt and still believe this was my
best chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jim Hunt, also a Democrat, is departing after serving the
second of two consecutive terms, creating a wide-open field with no
incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   Bowles said he doesn't miss the notoriety.
</P>
<P>
   In New York recently, he went into a store to buy a pair of
gloves. ``The clerk looked at the credit card and asked, `Are you
the Erskine Bowles?' I said, `No, but I used to be.`''

 Preparing Scannable Resumes  &HT;       
 By Ilana DeBare  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I'm applying for jobs and want to prepare a resume that
can be scanned into a database. What typeface and size of font
should I use?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  There are two kinds of resumes these days _ electronic
ones that can be sent over the Internet and the old-fashioned paper
kind.
</P>
<P>
   But even a lot of old-fashioned paper resumes now end up being
scanned into computer databases by employers.
</P>
<P>
   Why do employers scan resumes? They can save time and labor by
having the computer sort through hundreds of resumes for the
desired skills or buzzwords. And with a centralized database,
hiring managers from anywhere in the company can look at
applicants' resumes without having to ship vast amounts of paper
through the interoffice mail.
</P>
<P>
   Big companies are more likely to scan resumes than small
companies. If you're applying to a firm that might scan your
resume, it can't hurt to call the human resources department and
ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask them to send you a copy of their guidelines, which will
tell you things like whether bullet points work in their scanning
system,'' said Susan Ireland, a San Francisco resume consultant and
author of ``The Complete Idiot's Guide to the Perfect Resume.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some other tips for creating a scannable resume,
courtesy of Ireland:
</P>
<P>
   _Use black ink on white paper. High contrast stays more legible
through the scanning process.
</P>
<P>
   _Use a common typeface like Times, Palatino or Helvetica. Don't
use italics or boldface, and don't underline any words.
</P>
<P>
   _Use 10- to 14-point type size.
</P>
<P>
   _In the ``education'' section, use the year that you completed
your degree (``1986'') rather than the period you were in school
(``1982-86''). ``Scanners sometimes interpret `1982-82' as having
not finished a degree,'' Ireland cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   _Near the top of your resume, include a paragraph titled
``Keywords.'' List 20 to 60 words summarizing your most marketable
skills _ words like ``HTML,'' ``Microsoft Word,'' ``team leader''
or ``startup.'' Use a capital letter at the beginning of each word,
and a period after each one.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, boiling yourself down to a bunch of buzzwords can seem
reductionist. But the point is to catch the computer's eye _ so you
can land an interview and present yourself in greater depth and
nuance. If you want, you can mention in your cover letter that
you've included a ``Keywords'' section in your resume for easy
scanning.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can do a scannable resume that still looks good,'' said
Ireland. ``It won't have lots of bold face or big print, but you
can still do lots of nice layout.''
</P>
<P>
   Vacation Daze
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've worked for an auto-repair franchise in Colorado for six
years, six days a week. We were supposed to get one week of
vacation or the cash equivalent each year. Last July, the owner
sold the business. The new owner gave me my vacation for 1998 but
says he knows nothing about the five weeks of vacation time I built
up during the previous five years. What can I do?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; A: Generally, companies remain responsible for the bills they
owe and the contracts they've signed _ even if there's a change in
ownership. So the company shouldn't be able to deny you the
vacation time you've accrued just because there's a new face at the
top.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this employee worked all those years with the understanding
that he would receive a week's vacation each year, then he is owed
that vacation,'' said Robert Truhlar, an employment lawyer in
Littleton, Co. ``The new owner saying he didn't know about it is no
excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that basic principle, though, the law gets a little more
complicated and varies from state to state.
</P>
<P>
   You should start out by collecting as much firm evidence as
possible about the vacation time you're owed. Was there a personnel
handbook that said you were to receive one week off each year? Is
there a bookkeeper who kept track of everyone's vacation and who
could attest that you never received yours? If the vacation rules
weren't in writing, do you have co-workers who would back up your
understanding of the policy?
</P>
<P>
   You also should double-check whether the old owner's policy
allowed you to carry over unused vacation from year to year. Many
states like Colorado allow ``use-it-or-lose-it'' policies, in which
workers forfeit their vacation if they don't use it by the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   (California doesn't allow ``use-it-or-lose-it'' vacation
policies unless such a policy is part of a union contract. But
California does allow companies to cap vacation time at a certain
number of weeks and bar workers from accruing any more time off
once they've reached that limit.)
</P>
<P>
   Let's assume that the old owner did allow you to accrue vacation
and that you truly are owed these five weeks of time off.
</P>
<P>
   In California, you would take your case to the state labor
commissioner's office at (415) 557-7878.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, Truhlar advises, your best bet would be to go to
small-claims court. You don't need a lawyer to do this. And you
should present your case as a breach of contract rather than a wage
claim. That's because Colorado law requires the loser in wage-claim
cases to pay the winning side's legal fees _ a risk that isn't
worth taking in your case.
</P>
<P>
   But whichever state you're in, you should try appealing to the
new owner once more before turning to the legal authorities. Line
up your evidence. Present it in writing in a letter to your new
boss, and keep a copy. Mention politely that you would like to
resolve this issue quickly so that you don't have to turn to the
courts or the labor commissioner.
</P>
<P>

 &LR;  If this new owner is smart and honest, he'll look at the facts
and pay you what you're owed.

 Who Needs Corporate Headquarters When You Have Silicon Valley?  &HT;       
 By Mark Veverka  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
San Francisco has fallen victim yet again to one of the most pesky
side effects of economic globalization: the consolidation of the
financial services industry.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be long now before the mighty pyramid is nothing more
than a mere Yankee outpost for Dutch insurance conglomerate Aegon
(which happens to rhyme with long-gone).
</P>
<P>
   Say so long to another generous corporate citizen whose
acquisition invariably will lead to fewer dollars to be shared
among San Francisco's treasured artistic institutions and other
sundry recipients of financial philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, it will be those causes that depend on corporate
giving the most that will feel the greatest pain from the exodus of
the corporate headquarters of BankAmerica, Transamerica and
Robertson Stephens, to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   Still, let's not feel too sorry for ourselves. San Francisco
isn't alone. Banks and insurance companies are merging all over the
world. For instance, Los Angeles is no longer home to a major money
center bank, and Chicago has barely been able to hang on to the
headquarters of its lone big bank, the former First Chicago, which
has been bought twice _ most recently by Bank One.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, at least San Francisco still can lay claim to Wells
Fargo. That's more than Minneapolis can say now that its former
Norwest has migrated west.
</P>
<P>
   But more important, San Francisco is perched on the Pacific Rim
directly adjacent to the greatest economic engine on Earth: Silicon
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   So, let's stop crying in our Cabernet for a moment long enough
to consider the benefits of such good fortune. For one thing, while
San Francisco may no longer be a global financial center as it once
was, it is ground zero for banking operations devoted to
high-technology companies. Huge international financial concerns
such as Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse First Boston have expanded
their technology banking presence in San Francisco and in the
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   And the trend doesn't appear to be waning.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan is the latest global bank to fortify its Bay Area
beachhead. The Wall Street concern is expected to announce today
that it is bringing in a top executive to help run the company's
high-tech practice out of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of STREET19 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  David Weir, a managing director, will be named head of the bank's
13-state Western region and co-head of its technology and
telecommunications investment banking group. Weir will share
responsibility for building Morgan's technology banking practice
with managing director John Forlines, who will continue to
cultivate technology clients in the East from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to this assignment, Weir was president and chief executive
of Morgan's Canadian operations headquartered in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Morgan was running its technology banking operation
out of New York. But like its counterparts, Morgan realizes that
bankers need to be closer to the Bay Area's robust tech community.
``Basically, what we're trying to do here is get closer to our
clients,'' said Weir in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan hopes to fill some of the void in the tech-underwriting
market created by the buyouts of Robertson Stephens (by BankBoston)
and Montgomery Securities (by BankAmerica). By increasing staff in
its San Francisco office, Morgan hopes to win over emerging
companies with an improved local focus supported by its
international banking prowess. Morgan boasts 51 offices in 33
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to say that we bring global reach with a local
touch,'' Weir said.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Morgan has about a dozen investment bankers and four
research analysts based in San Francisco. That compares with about
10 technology bankers and a dozen related analysts in New York. As
part of the new push, Weir said he hopes to add another six bankers
or so in San Francisco over the next 12 to 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   To date, critics and rival bankers contend that Morgan has found
the Bay Area tough sledding when it comes to technology, citing a
handful of recent defections from Morgan as evidence of troubles
with the practice.
</P>
<P>
   But Weir debunked Morgan's critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did suffer a couple of departures, but that's not unique to
J.P. Morgan,'' Weir said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (investment banking) business on the West Coast is in a
bit of turmoil due to the buyouts of some of the boutiques,'' said
Weir, referring to rampant job-hopping in the Bay Area banking
community sparked largely by the Robertson Stephens and Montgomery
buyouts.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan has underwritten a wide-range of technology IPOs. Last
year, it was the lead manager of a $6.4 billion initial offering
for Swisscom, the largest IPO worldwide in 1998. At the same time,
Morgan was the lead manager on the $29 million IPO of Internet
darling EarthWeb, a deal that many credit with rekindling interest
in technology IPOs after the August market meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of STREET19 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Unlike some other commercial banks that have entered investment
banking through acquisition _ that is, by buying underwriting firms
and brokerages _ Morgan has built its investment banking practice
from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan launched its equity business in 1991 after regulatory
barriers that prevented it from underwriting stocks were lifted.
The practice's ascension has been impressive. In 1996, Morgan was
ranked 16th in the number of initial offerings in which it was the
lead manager. By last year, Morgan had climbed to sixth; and so far
this year, it is the fourth-most-productive underwriter of IPOs,
Weir said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the addition of a dozen investment bankers in no way
compensates for San Francisco's loss of another corporate
headquarters. That would be absurd. But it demonstrates a small but
important point. San Francisco is the financial center for the
technological revolution. And that ain't half bad.

 Genentech's Heart Drug Disappoints  &HT;       
 By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Genentech Inc. said yesterday it was disappointed by test results
for a new drug meant to treat patients suffering from extreme forms
of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech has been one of several firms experimenting with drugs
that try to stimulate the growth of new blood vessels _ a process
called angiogenesis _ to bypass the clogged arteries that cause
heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   These experiments had generated great excitement because they
held out the hope of treating a growing number of patients unable
to withstand the rigors of heart surgery or angioplasty.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; But in a terse announcement yesterday, the South San Francisco
biotech giant said its Phase II study of vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) ``did not meet its primary objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   Genentech Chief Medical Officer Sue Hellmann said the company
had tested VEGF on 178 patients. Some got the experimental drug,
others received a placebo. The company had hoped patients who got
VEGF would show greater endurance on treadmill exercises,
indicating improved blood flow to their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Although the study won't be released until March 9, Genentech
got its first look at the data this week and realized they fell
short of expectations, Hellmann said. Given the publicity
angiogenesis has received, the company took the unusual step of
immediately signaling its disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street shrugged off the news as Genentech slipped 44 cents
to close at $79.50 yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Joel Sendek with Gerard Klauer Mattison in New York said
Genentech has so many products in its development pipeline, a
glitch in one effort doesn't affect investors' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Sendek said Genentech hasn't yet said whether it will revise or
scrap its VEGF program and that the firm probably won't make any
such decision until after conferring with the cardiologists who ran
the tests.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tim Henry, a University of Minnesota cardiologist who
conducted parts of the study, said he expects Genentech and other
companies, including Chiron Corp. of Emeryville, to continue
experiments in this field because angiogenesis offers hope to
patients who have exhausted their other options.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd like to hit a home run the first time you try it, but
that's not the way things work,'' he said. ``I think this may
temper enthusiasm in the field, but it won't stop it.''

<P>
   GANDHINAGAR, India _ The way political leaders here in Gujarat
state have been talking lately, one might think they want nothing
to do with Christian missionaries.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Minister Keshubhai Patel, of the Hindu nationalist
Bharatiya Janata Party, has accused them of bribing poor,
illiterate Hindus to convert to Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This cannot be allowed,'' he told Frontline magazine.
</P>
<P>
   And last month, the intelligence branch of the state police sent
out a secret circular instructing officers to find out where
Christians live, the identities of their leaders, the foreign
countries purportedly encouraging them, any firearms they possess
and ``the tricks'' they use to convert people. They were also to
collect dossiers on Christians with ``criminal minds.''
</P>
<P>
   These words and deeds coincide with an unusual upsurge in
attacks against Christians in India. Some say zealots have been
emboldened by the statements of Hindu nationalists like Patel,
whose party came to power last March both in Gujarat and as the
head of a national coalition government in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the hostility to Christians in Gujarat, where Hindu
militants have attacked dozens of Christian prayer halls and
schools over the last year, several Hindu nationalist leaders,
including Patel, have chosen to have their offspring educated by
those same reviled Roman Catholic missionaries.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these officials explain that while the children of
uneducated, lower-caste people are vulnerable to the conversion
methods of the missionaries, their own children and grandchildren _
from educated, prosperous, devoutly Hindu families _ would never be
tempted.
</P>
<P>
   The missionaries also happen to have a reputation for running
some of the finest schools in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Patel declined to be interviewed, but his daughter-in-law,
Manjuben Patel, confirmed in a brief telephone interview that she
and her husband live in a traditional, extended family with the
chief minister and that her son goes to Mount Carmel, a Catholic
school here in the state capital.
</P>
<P>
   Patel's grandson is far from alone. The children of the
ministers of Transport, Fisheries and Youth Services and the
chairman of the State Finance Corporation _ all elected state
legislative assembly members from the Bharatiya Janata Party _ also
attend Catholic schools.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Transport Minister Bimal Shah described
what he said were the connivances Christians use in rural areas to
convert low-caste children. Behind him was a portrait of the leader
of the Hindu nationalist group that spawned the Bharatiya Janata
Party, the late Madhav Golwalkar, who condemned Christians for
trying to demolish India's Hindu way of life.
</P>
<P>
   Shah narrated a version of an anecdote that Patel and others
have repeated as evidence of the missionaries' nefarious
intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Shah said he had heard that it happened like this: A group of
children, accompanied by nuns, were on a bus when the driver
suddenly stopped and locked the door. The sisters asked the
children what God they believed in and they replied that they were
Hindus.
</P>
<P>
   So the nuns suggested the children pray to their Hindu God to
start the bus. The motor stayed silent. Then they suggested the
Muslim children pray to Allah. Still the bus did not start. Only
when the children prayed to Jesus Christ did the driver turn the
ignition key.
</P>
<P>
   ``They try to convert the small children,'' Shah said
indignantly. ``They mentally prepare them to believe that the only
God on earth is Jesus Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   Shah never volunteered that his twin 7-year-old daughters attend
Mount Carmel, run by Sister Prescilla Lobo of the Apostolic Carmel
Congregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very near to my residence,'' explained Shah, who was a
bit flustered when asked where his children went to school. ``In
education, the Christians do very well.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Most parents, after all, want a good education for their
children, whatever their politics, be they rich or poor, Hindu,
Muslim or Christian.
</P>
<P>
   While the fear that children may lose their family's religious
faith is common in many cultures, Christians have made few inroads
in India, even though they have been here for more than a
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   And in recent years, there has been no complaint of forced
conversions filed with the police, according to Gujarat's home
secretary, V.V. Rama Subba Rao, who sent his own children in
Catholic schools.
</P>
<P>
   The principals and teachers in Gujarat's Catholic schools say
they do not seek to convert children. They call the recent attacks
on Christians a cynical ploy to stir the passions of Hindu voters
against a small minority.
</P>
<P>
   Christians make up less than half of one percent of Gujarat's
population of 40 million and 2.3 percent of the nation's 960
million people, but they have influence beyond their numbers
because of their role in educating the nation's mostly upper-caste
Hindu elite _ and increasingly its most disadvantaged, low-caste
and tribal children as well.
</P>
<P>
   There are 4.8 million students attending 15,000 Catholic schools
in India, in addition to the 5,000 to 6,000 in Protestant schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist leader Jyoti Basu in West Bengal and the country's
home minister, L.K. Advani, a Hindu nationalist firebrand, have one
thing in common: they were educated in Christian schools. So was
the Congress Party president Sonia Gandhi's daughter Priyanka.
</P>
<P>
   In Gujarat, the state government itself invited the Jesuits and
the Sisters of the Apostolic Carmel Congregation to open a school
in the new capital of Gandhinagar, created from scratch in the late
1960s, and gave them the land to build on.
</P>
<P>
   The original school has since split into Mount Carmel with 2,200
students and St. Xavier's with 2,650, more than 90 percent of them
Hindu. The state pays the high-school teachers' salaries. The
schools, in turn, use the state syllabus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The civil servants refused to move to Gandhinagar until there
was a good convent school here,'' said the Rev. Hector Pinto,
principal of St. Xavier's and a native of the southern Indian state
of Goa. ``This school was meant for the children of ministers,
bureaucrats and clerks.''
</P>
<P>
   Gandhinagar itself is an oddity in crowded, ancient India. It is
a new, middle-class city of government workers who drive their
scooters on broad streets that seem empty of traffic and who labor
in ugly, modern boxes of concrete. The ministers live in large
houses on tree-lined suburban streets.
</P>
<P>
   The lives of the priests and nuns who run the Gandhinagar
schools are intertwined with state officialdom. Pinto recently
dined at the home of C.J. Thakkar, special secretary to the chief
minister. Thakkar's son and daughter attend St. Xavier's.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was not a word of politics,'' Pinto said. ``He's a very
pious Hindu and he's the right hand of the chief minister. But for
Christmas, he gave me a huge crucifix.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinto displayed the crucifix, a large metal cross painted silver
and inlaid with faux emeralds and rubies, still tucked inside a
box.
</P>
<P>
   The children of government officials give their Catholic schools
rave reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Thakkar's daughter, Rahayada, 17, said she has never been
pressed to convert. ``I'm proud of my school,'' she said. ``It's
the best place to study.''
</P>
<P>
   Prerak Mahindra Trivedi, 15, whose father is Youth Services
minister, said St. Xavier's was far better than public schools.
``The teachers in government schools do not understand their duty
to teach,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Pinto and the principal at Mount Carmel, Sister Lobo, said
they were routinely pressed to admit the children of influential
civil servants and elected officials and often did.
</P>
<P>
   The family of the chief minister sought admission for his
grandson at Mount Carmel after the school year had begun and all
the spots were filled, said Sister Lobo, a native of Karnataka
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since he's the chief minister's grandson, we had to give,''
she said, ``He's the authority in the state.''
</P>
<P>
   One recent morning, hundreds of parents gathered on the
spacious, sunlit campus of St. Xavier's for an exhibit of their
children's art. In one corner, a cutout of Santa Claus brushed
shoulders with a collage of the Hindu elephant deity Ganesh, while
Kali, the fierce Hindu goddess of destruction, shared a wall with
Mickey Mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Prakash Pandya, a civil engineer who works for the state, had
come to peek at the creation of his 10-year-old daughter, Kinara.
He described himself as a Brahmin, the highest caste among Hindus,
but said he wouldn't think of sending Kinara anywhere but St.
Xavier's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have our caste school,'' he said. ``But they are very
narrow-minded. Here we feel the openness.''
</P>
<P>
   Pandya voted for the Bharatiya Janata Party but says of their
stance on the missionaries, ``That is all politics.''

 Pyramid to Retain the Transamerica Name  &HT;       
 By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
The Aegon Pyramid?
</P>
<P>
   Not a chance. The Transamerica Pyramid will keep its name,
despite yesterday's announcement that San Francisco's Transamerica
Corp. has been acquired by Aegon NV of The Hague, Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, layoffs will be negligible in San Francisco, where
the company maintains little more than a skeleton staff.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Transamerica has sold some divisions and moved
others to less expensive cities, leaving just 150 employees in its
famous Financial District headquarters out of a nationwide total of
8,700.
</P>
<P>
   ``The headquarters will remain the same, the name will remain
the same, I will remain chairman of the U.S. company and there will
not be any substantial impact on employment or philanthropy'' in
San Francisco, said Transamerica chief executive Frank Herringer.
``Things will just continue the way they have been.''
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1986, Transamerica had 2,400 employees here; now
its offices in Chicago, Dallas, Kansas City, Los Angeles and
Purchase, N.Y., are significantly larger than its San Francisco
headquarters, which houses senior executives and corporate services
such as payroll and accounting.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the operations in other cities may see job losses as
Transamerica and other Aegon-owned businesses consolidate. Aegon
may also sell some of Transamerica's noninsurance assets such as a
real estate tax service in Dallas, although no decisions have been
made.
</P>
<P>
   As a wholly owned subsidiary of Aegon (pronounced AY-gon),
Transamerica will jump from the sixth-largest life insurer in the
United States U.S. &LR; to the third, as measured by assets. Aegon is
the world's third-largest insurer in terms of market
capitalization.
</P>
<P>
   Herringer said the sale was necessary for Transamerica to remain
competitive in an industry marked increasingly by massive global
players. ``Really big companies have an advantage because they can
buy the best people, they have the biggest computers, they have the
best access to capital and they can spread the costs over a wide
variety of products,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aegon will also benefit from owning the widely recognized
Transamerica name and pyramid-building logo, which it plans to
extend to some of its other products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Branding is more and more of an issue in financial services
and it is very, very expensive to establish a national brand,''
Herringer said.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of TRANSAM1 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Other Aegon brands include Commonwealth and Veteran's Life.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition is expected to be completed this summer. Aegon
has agreed to pay $10.8 billion in cash, stock and assumed debt for
Transamerica.
</P>
<P>
   Transamerica's assets totaled $58.5 billion in 1998, with
insurance representing $46 billion. Assets of Aegon's U.S.
division, which is based in Baltimore, totaled $63.7 billion in
1997, the latest year for which data is available, and worldwide
assets were $135.2 billion.

   General Dynamics, the nation's largest maker of nuclear-powered
submarines, stunned the defense industry by making an unsolicited
$1.4 billion bid for Newport News Shipbuilding, the No. 2 maker.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was surprising for two reasons: First, the government,
in a reversal of policy, has been halting defense industry mergers
and this deal would create only one supplier of nuclear-powered
submarines. Secondly, it throws in question the Newport News $470

 19 Drug Firms Settle Lawsuit  &HT;       
 By Rebecca Smith 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Nineteen big drug companies have agreed to pay $176 million to
settle a class-action lawsuit that accuses them of gouging the
public by overcharging for medicines sold through independent
pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
   Merck &AMP; Co. will pay the most, at $19.5 million, and Carter
Wallace, at $705,000, will pay the least.
</P>
<P>
   In the case, plaintiffs' attorneys contend that the drug
companies use an unfair, two-tiered system to price wholesale
drugs. The suit said they sell drugs at discounts to health
maintenance organizations and other big volume buyers like mail
order drug firms, but charge exorbitant prices to neighborhood
pharmacies and, in some cases, drug store chains.
</P>
<P>
   For example, druggists said they pay up to $28.90 for 100
tablets of a synthetic thyroid drug called Synthroid made by Knoll
Pharmaceuticals, one of the defendants, but that HMOs pay as little
as $1.43.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed settlement to the class-action lawsuit, brought on
behalf of California's 32 million consumers, would not refund money
directly to the public. Instead, the 19 pharmaceutical companies
would furnish $148 million worth of brand-name drugs to 300
nonprofit medical clinics throughout the state that dispense drugs
to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the drug companies would pay $1.6 million &UR;  &LR; to
administer the three-year program and $27 million for attorneys'
fees.
</P>
<P>
   Legal notice of the settlement will appear in newspapers,
including The Chronicle, beginning Monday. The court will instruct
the public about the terms and give those who don't like the
agreement the opportunity to opt out.
</P>
<P>
   Although $176 million sounds like a lot, a Sausalito pharmacist
who was instrumental in bringing the lawsuit five years ago says
the settlement is disgraceful and should be rejected by the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The settlement is no damn good because it does nothing to
alter the behavior of the drug companies,'' said Fred Mayer, a
pharmacist for 45 years and past president of the California Public
Health Association, a group that represents the clinics that stand
to receive the free drugs. ``It represents a cheap settlement for
the drug companies and they'll go on, business as usual, ripping
off the public.''
</P>
<P>
   The case that reached settlement this week is just one of many
to be brought on similar grounds in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   In a Chicago case settled three years ago, many of the same drug
companies agreed to pay $700 million to settle price-fixing
charges. Five drug companies refused to join the settlement. When
their case came to trial last year, it was thrown out by the
federal court judge in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   In California, one other big drug-pricing case remains
unresolved. It was brought on behalf of pharmacists on nearly
identical grounds as the consumer class action suit _ collusion,
price fixing and unfair practices.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the two-tiered price system, local druggists have
had to charge higher prices to their customers, a trend, they say,
that lies behind a sharp drop in the number of independent
pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
   The number of independent pharmacies in California has dropped
from more than 7,000 a decade ago to around 5,000 today. Whether
that's due to the pricing scheme or competition from big chains
remains a hotly debated issue.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the drug companies said yesterday the settlement
is more than fair to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the basic complaint had little merit,'' said Mary
B. Cranston, chairwoman of Pillsbury Madison &AMP; Sutro in San
Francisco, which represented French drugmaker Rhone Poulenc Rorer
in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is whether there's anything illegal about the
pricing system in place,'' said Cranston. ``The fact is, there
isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Cranston said pharmacists exaggerate the price disparity. On
average, she said, HMOs pay only 10 to 15 percent less than
independent druggists.
</P>
<P>
   The case is set for a final hearing at 10 a.m. on April 21
before San Francisco Superior Court Judge Alfred Chiantelli.
</P>
<P>
   Several issues remain that may come before Chiantelli. Mayer
said it appears that drug companies will be allowed to value their
donations at the ``average wholesale price'' _ the price that
instigated the lawsuit _ rather than the lower price charged HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   He believes the court should force them to make donations at the
lower price since it would result in more medicine reaching the
poor.
</P>
<P>
   The drug companies joining the settlement are: Merck &AMP; Co.,
Glaxo, Bristol-Myers Squibb, American Home Products, Eli Lilly,
Pfizer, SmithKline Beecham, Upjohn, Schering, Zeneca, Warner
Lambert, Abbott, Burroughs Wellcome, American Cyanamid, Rhone
Poulenc Rorer, Dupont Merck, Boehringer Ingleheim, Knoll and Carter
Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   Named in the lawsuit but not joining the settlement were:
Ciba-Geigy, G.D. Searle, Hoffmann LaRoche, Johnson &AMP; Johnson,
Marion Merrell Dow, Ortho Pharmaceutical, Purdue-Frederick, Forest
Laboratories and Sandez Pharmaceuticals.

GENERAL DYNAMICS MAKES $1.4 BILLION BID FOR NEWPORT NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Conn., La., Maine., R.I.)  (js) 
 By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   General Dynamics Corp., the nation's largest military
shipbuilder, stunned the defense industry Thursday by making an
unsolicited $1.4 billion offer for rival Newport News Shipbuilding
Inc., in the face of a changing government policy that has
discouraged such consolidations.
</P>
<P>
   News of the offer began to leak out late Thursday and was made
official by the two companies later in the day. The General
Dyanmics bid had already come to Newport News on Feb. 10 in a
letter. General Dynamics is offering $38.50 for every Newport News
share, a premium of 35.4 percent over its closing price Thursday.
It would also assume $600 million in Newport News debt.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was surprising for two reasons: First, the government,
in a reversal of policy, has been halting military industry
mergers, and this deal would create only one supplier of
nuclear-powered submarines and put four of the nation's six defense
shipyards in the hands of one company. Second, it throws in
question Newport News' $470 million friendly takeover of Avondale
Industries, the nation's No. 4 military shipbuilder. That merger
was announced last month and has not yet closed.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Defense Department nor the Justice Department would
comment on the offer Thursday. Late last year, the government,
after nearly a decade of encouraging defense industry
consolidations, stopped the $8.3 billion bid by Lockheed Martin
Corp. to buy Northrop Grumman Corp., signaling the start of a
harsher attitude in Washington toward such combinations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This certainly muddies the waters for Newport News in its
plans to acquire Avondale,'' said Paul Nisbet, an analyst with JSA
Research in Newport, R.I. ``And there are very possible problems
with the government on this one. Given the government's view of the
Lockheed-Northrop deal, the government may find this unacceptable.
But General Dynamics must think there's a fair chance they can do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to the bid, Newport News said that under its merger
agreement with Avondale, it was not permitted to enter into any
other merger unless the Newport News board determined it was
superior financially and that it was reasonably capable of being
completed. To that end, Newport News said it would not respond to
the General Dynamics offer until it has received a signal from the
government that such a union would be permitted. It also said it
had asked the government to pre-review the deal for antitrust
concerns.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Because of recent antitrust scrutiny in the defense sector, we
believe the General Dynamics proposal requires a careful assessment
of the antitrust risk and a reliable assurance that it is unlikely
to be a problem,'' said William P. Fricks, chief executive of
Newport News, which is also the sole maker of nuclear-powered
aircraft carriers. ``At this time, General Dynamics has not
satisfied the board's concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Should the board become satisfied, it would then be prepared
to evaluate the terms of the General Dynamics proposal,'' he added.
``Meanwhile, we remain fully committed to the Avondale
transaction.''
</P>
<P>
   General Dynamics had no comment on Thursday. General Dynamics,
the parent of Electric Boat in Groton, Conn., bought Bath Iron
Works in Maine in 1995 and National Steel and Shipbuilding Co. of
San Diego, a cargo shipbuilder, last year.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Avondale, based in New Orleans, remained
``absolutely committed'' to the Newport News deal, a spokesman
said. ``We remain committed to going forward with this,'' said Gene
Simon, vice president for finance at Avondale. ``The General
Dynamics offer is not something that anyone could control, so there
is no reason to get worked up about it. Newport News says it is
committed to the deal and we believe them. No one can control a
third party.''
</P>
<P>
   This General Dynamics bid pits two conflicting issues within the
military industry. On one hand, the government wants to maintain
multiple suppliers to keep the cost of military supplies low and to
maintain readiness. At the same time, there are real economic
questions of whether the United States can afford to maintain two
shipyards capable of building nuclear-powered vessels when the
government plans to build only one nuclear-powered submarine a year
and only one nuclear-powered aircraft carrier every five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal is breathtaking,'' said one military industry
consultant, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``It would
concentrate about 80 percent of the military shipbuilding in one
company and, together, there would be a single national supplier of
nuclear-powered vessels. But there is actually something to be said
for this because there really is not enough workload to sustain all
these nuclear shipyards. But I don't know if the government will
see it that way.''

CLINTON HITS COMEBACK TRAIL IN NEW HAMPSHIRE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Seeking to renew his ``comeback kid''
moniker, President Clinton ventured back Thursday to the state that
propelled him to the White House despite questions about his
character in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hit the comeback trail as he made his first domestic
trip since the Senate six days ago acquitted him of impeachment
charges stemming from an affair with a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Critics may have declared his presidency dead _ just as they
once did his candidacy _ but Clinton stressed his long-term health
care proposal, a poll-tested idea popular with voters, before
raising money for state Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the experts expected you to send me home; instead, you
made me feel at home,'' Clinton told Democrats as he marked the
seventh anniversary of the New Hampshire primary that resurrected
his campaign for president.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago, Clinton declared himself ``the comeback kid''
as New Hampshire voters struggling under the weight of jobless
statistics and record foreclosures turned aside accusations of
draft dodging and infidelity to embrace his agenda for economic
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   They saved his sagging campaign, even through he came in second,
and provided him with a roadmap for recovery that he has used
repeatedly: talk policy when everyone else talks scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never forgotten, as anyone who works for me at the
White House will tell you, the kindness and the toughness, the
humanity and the determination of the people of New Hampshire who
would not let our campaign, and what we wanted to do for America,
die,'' Clinton told more than 1,000 Democrats who paid at least
$100 for the state party dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Begala, the president's counselor, said, ``There's a
popular myth that he survived in New Hampshire or that he survived
today because of his political talent, which is manifest. My view
is that he is surviving, then and today, because of his ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about if he could deliver a speech, it's if he could
deliver a program,'' Begala said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House released a ``then'' and ``now'' tote sheet that
showed New Hampshire's jobless rate falling from 7.3 percent to 2.9
percent under Clinton's reign. It boasted of job growth, a sharp
reduction in business failures, an increase in homeownership, and a
reduction in crime and welfare rolls during Clinton's watch.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone was glad to see him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. President, you're a disgrace!'' proclaimed a banner
headline in The Union Leader, the state's largest newspaper.
``Don't come back, kid,'' read a front-page editorial by
conservative publisher Nackey Loeb, who urged him to clear his
toothbrush out of the White House and resign.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans, upset that a state armory was being used as the site
for a fund-raising dinner, planned a mock impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   The president appeared in nearby Dover at a roundtable
discussion on long-term health care where he sought to underscore
his proposal for a $1,000 tax credit to families that care for
elderly relatives.
</P>
<P>
   It's a forum that favors Clinton's brand of empathetic politics
that helped him overcome initial scandal allegations in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I lost an uncle and an aunt to Alzheimer's,''
Clinton told a crowd of 200 after hearing Beth Dixon, a tearful
Concord mother of four, talk about caring for her father who had
the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when we hear somebody like Beth talk, we may have
mixed feelings, but don't know how that woman did that. On the
other hand, I think we're all thinking, Beth, it's a good thing
extended families can stay together for as long as possible. And I
consider this tax credit just a down payment on what I think our
country should be doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago at the Dover Elks Club, Clinton gave the most
famous speech of his campaign. Six days out and his poll numbers
plummeting, Clinton said, ``They tell me I'm on the ropes ...
because other people have questioned my life after years of public
service. You give me this election and I won't be like George Bush
and forget you. I'll be with you until the last dog dies.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton joked Thursday night that if the New Hampshire voters
had listened to political experts ``the dog would have died, but
instead you held out a lifeline. You decided that the election
would go on. You decided that new ideas and a new direction for our
country deserved a fair hearing with the American people. You
embraced our call.''
</P>
<P>
   On primary night, Clinton finished second to former
Massachusetts Sen. Paul Tsongas with 26 percent of the vote but
sounded as though he had won the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a tough campaign, but at least I've proved I can
take a punch,'' Clinton told his supporters on election night. ``I
think we know with enough certainty that New Hampshire tonight has
made Bill Clinton the comeback kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, his presidency saved by the Senate last week, he now has
less than two years to reclaim that title.

ERITREA'S CHOICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the outskirts of Asmara, the capital, Eritreans have
assembled a singular war memorial: a junkyard of tanks, trucks, and
other vehicles abandoned by the Ethiopian Army when it admitted
defeat in 1991. The struggle has resumed, and the Eritreans would
show great wisdom if they ended the current round of fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict is supposedly about a patch of land left in
political limbo by badly drawn colonial maps, but the real issue is
the relationship between the two countries. Ethiopia has not yet
reconciled itself to Eritrean independence, and the cocksure
Eritrean government is intent on asserting itself in the Horn of
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of troops are massed on the border. Ethiopia, with 57
million people, would seem to have an advantage over the 3.3
million in Eritrea, but Eritrea ``is a veritable war machine,''
according to Agence France-Presse, which notes that only Israel can
match its ability to mobilize 8 percent of its population for war.
</P>
<P>
   The Ethiopians, who started the latest round of fighting this
month, have made few gains. They have, however, opened a front near
the port of Assab, and the people there seem ready for all-out war.
``They are the ones who chose this,'' a resident told the
Associated Press. ``They just want our land. But Eritrea is always
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Assab was once Ethiopia's major port. Over the past two years,
business has declined, and 3,200 jobs have been lost. Eritrea needs
good relations with Ethiopia to develop a strong economy.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia has accepted a peace plan proposed by the Organization
for African Unity, while Eritrea has withheld a response pending
clarifications. The plan would allow Ethiopian administrators to
return to disputed territory pending a final demarcation. A
significant concession for Eritrea, this is far better than a long
war.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea, like Israel, can defeat but not conquer its larger
neighbors. The plan offers an honorable way to end the war while
Eritrea and Ethiopia figure out how to live with each other. The
memorial in Asmara need not grow any larger.

IN $9.7 BILLION DEAL, TRANSAMERICA WILL BE BOUGHT BY A DUTCH
COMPANY
</HEADLINE>
  (fe) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE 
 
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
 
  ROME _ Aegon NV, a big Dutch company that has been on a shopping
spree in the fiercely competitive life insurance business, said on
Thursday that it was buying Transamerica Corp. of San Francisco for
$9.7 billion in cash and stock.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aegon, a diversified concern that is principally an insurer,
will also take on $1.1 billion in Transamerica debt. With the
acquisition, Aegon said, it will become the third-largest life
insurer in the United States in terms of assets and premiums. The
deal also reinforces its standing as the third-largest insurance
company worldwide in market capitalization.
</P>
<P>
   Transamerica, which is the sixth-largest life insurer in the
United States, will be merged with the insurance business of
Providian Corp. of Baltimore, which Aegon acquired for $2.6 billion
in 1997. The companies said the Transamerica name and logo would be
retained ``wherever appropriate'' and would be extended to some of
Aegon's products in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Transamerica Pyramid, the company's headquarters building,
which is a San Francisco landmark, will remain part of the combined
companies, along with Transamerica's leasing, real estate and
commercial lending units.
</P>
<P>
   In life insurance, the new combination would trail only
Prudential Life Insurance Co. and Metropolitan Life Insurance,
based on existing policies. The combined company expects to cut
annual costs, before taxes, by about $150 million, beginning in
three years.
</P>
<P>
   Aegon's chairman, Kees J. Storm, said the company was not
finished searching for increased size through acquisitions, notably
in Europe. But, in a televised interview, he said it ``might take a
couple of years to swallow'' Transamerica.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Aegon has flourished by focusing on life
insurance and pensions, avoiding the diversified financial services
businesses that rivals like ING Groep of the Netherlands and
Citigroup have pursued. Aegon's strategy has generated average
annual profit growth above 16 percent and has won the approval of
investors, who pushed up Aegon's share price 86 percent in the last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Investors appeared to approve of Thursday's combination, as
well, sending Transamerica's stock soaring $15.25 a share, or 26.5
percent, to $72.875 on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was
the most actively traded issue. Aegon rose to 89.30 euros, up 4.70,
after touching a high of 92.20 euros earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Frank C. Herringer, Transamerica's chairman and chief executive,
said policyholders stood to gain from the added security of the
combined companies. ``We are strong; they are superstrong,'' said
Herringer, who will get a seat on Aegon's board and will oversee
consumer finance, leasing and real estate, Transamerica's
noninsurance businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Aegon said it would pay 30 percent of the $9.7 billion purchase
price in cash and 70 percent in stock. Aegon said it expected the
acquisition, which is subject to approval by shareholders of both
companies, to be complete by midyear.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``They're going to be a dominant force _ period,'' Andrew
Kligerman, an analyst with Schroder Wertheim &AMP; Company in New York,
said. ``I certainly think scale will be critical going forward, as
the industry becomes more price sensitive. You have got to have
scale in a highly competitive market.''
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition gives Aegon a stronger presence in Canada and a
thick network of Transamerica sales agents focusing on wealthy
clients.
</P>
<P>
   Keven Maloney, senior bank analyst at Moody's Investors Service
Inc. _ which called Aegon's acquisition ``sound and consistent with
its stated strategy of developing its international life insurance
operations'' _ said the only elements of risk were Aegon's
assumption of increased debt and the entry into financial services.
</P>
<P>
   Maloney said policyholders stood to benefit. ``They become part
of a bigger business enterprise with more financial flexibility
behind it than was the case, say, yesterday,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear just how many policyholders the combined companies
will have in North America, though Herringer said Transamerica
alone had about two million outstanding policies.
</P>
<P>
   Though Aegon is noted for avoiding nonlife insurance businesses
and sold Providian's auto and home insurance businesses to HFS
Inc., Herringer said Aegon was taking a ``wait-and-see attitude''
toward Transamerica's activities outside insurance. ``They
recognize that they are good businesses, they're all market
leaders, they're all well-managed,'' he said. ``They have to be fed
and nourished.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald J. Shepard, chairman and chief executive of Aegon USA,
which will be merged with Transamerica, while retaining much of its
corporate identity, said cost cutting would come largely from
reductions in overlapping activities like data processing but would
not represent ``big-time cost cutting.'' The combined companies
will have about 20,000 employees, and ``it isn't a big layoff type
of thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For San Francisco's financial services industry, the deal was
the second outside takeover in recent months. Last year, the Bank
of America, a hallmark of the city and one of its oldest financial
institutions, was acquired by Nationsbank, which is based in North
Carolina, though the merged banks retained the name BankAmerica.
</P>
<P>
   Although only about 100 of Transamerica's 8,700 employees work
in the Pyramid, the 853-foot-tall building is a notable feature of
the San Francisco skyline. Its distinctive silhouette is prominent
on company stationery and in television ads and has helped
Transamerica imprint brand recognition, much like Prudential's
rock, on traditionally faceless insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Leal, the San Francisco city treasurer, said on Thursday
that Aegon's acquisition of Transamerica would probably have little
impact on the way the company is perceived in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Transamerica has always been involved in the city, but more as
an icon _ the Pyramid on the skyline,'' she said. ``The Pyramid is
right there with the Golden Gate Bridge as a symbol of San
Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   Company officials said there were no plans to change the the
Pyramid's name. Indeed, as advertising budgets in the insurance
business swell, reflecting increased competition, ``the real gem in
the whole thing is the Pyramid,'' Kligerman of Schroder &AMP; Wertheim
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Aegon deal is just the latest in a wave of mergers and
acquisitions that are redesigning the insurance industry. The
combined value of such activity in 1998 was $68.7 billion,
according to Securities Data Co. Thus far this year it has totaled
$18 billion, compared with $4 billion in the corresponding period
of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The price Aegon will pay makes the deal the third largest to
date in the American insurance industry, exceeded only by Berkshire
Hathaway's acquisition last year of General Re for $22.3 billion
and the American International Group's purchase of Sun America Inc.
for $17.8 billion.

STARBUCKS, MCGWIRE GO TO BAT FOR LITERACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CONSTANCE SOMMER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ You wouldn't be reading this story right now if Mark
McGwire wasn't practically addicted to Starbucks coffee.
</P>
<P>
   The guy's been drinking it for 10 years. The home run world
record holder even convinced his team, the St. Louis Cardinals, to
serve the coffee in the clubhouse, allowing him to down it in the
dugout all season long.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's spokesman, who's paid to know all about his client,
can't explain exactly what the attraction is here. But it's the
reason why this baseball season, every time McGwire hits a home
run, Seattle-based Starbucks will donate $5,000 to a literacy
organization in the city where the home run was hit.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, McGwire homered 70 times, setting a major leage
record. Starbucks promised yesterday that whatever the number this
year, it will donate at least $250,000 to literacy causes under a
program it's formed with McGwire called ``Out of the Park _ Into
the Books'' (for the mathematically impaired, that's the equivalent
of 50 home runs).
</P>
<P>
   But wait a minute _ let's go back to the beginning of this tale.
Or rather, the near beginning, when after a decade of sipping the
coffee, McGwire strolled into a Starbucks store on Santa Monica's
Third Street Promenade last October and asked if he could buy a
company hat.
</P>
<P>
   The latte server behind the counter told McGwire that Starbucks
didn't sell its hats. But, he added, if McGwire would sign his
green apron, the baseball star could have the hat off his head,
according to Jerry Archambeault, McGwire's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Next thing the Starbucks folks know, there's McGwire on national
TV, tossing out the first ball of the final game of the 1998 World
Series, a Starbucks cap on his head.
</P>
<P>
   You can't buy that kind of publicity. The next day, Starbucks
chairman and chief executive Howard Schultz did the polite thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sent him a little note, congratulating him on the season and
thanking him for wearing the hat,'' Schultz said.
</P>
<P>
   That little note went a long way with McGwire, who'd just read
Schultz's book ``Pour Your Heart Into It: How Starbucks Built a
Company One Cup at a Time.'' The baseball player seen as a hero by
Americans young and old alike counted Schultz as one of his heroes.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, the phone rang in Schultz's Seattle office and
it was Mark McGwire on the other end of the line.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire thanked Schultz for the note, and Schultz complimented
McGwire on the way he handled himself the entire season, on his
warm relationship with rival Sammy Sosa, and on his general
``humility and grace,'' Schultz recalled. The men traded stories
about their two young sons. They got along great _ so great, in
fact, that in December McGwire visited Seattle and stayed overnight
at Schultz's home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent the entire evening and the following day getting to
know one another, talking about the responsibility to be a role
model that he felt as an athlete ... and the responsibility we feel
as a company to fiscal benevolence,'' Schultz said. ``We began to
talk about the ways we could cooperate together to raise awareness
and hope for kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Those talks led to the literacy pledge, which McGwire and
Schultz announced Thursday at a joint press conference in a West
Hollywood, Calif., Starbucks store. McGwire was not available
afterward to talk by phone to the media, but in a statement he
said: ``Teaming up with Starbucks provides me with another way to
reach out to children. Knowing that the company will donate money
for each home run to help kids learn to read ensures that this
season will be special.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle does not stand to benefit from this pledge, since the
Mariners are in the American League and McGwire's Cardinals are in
the National League. The cities that could be affected _ including
the sites of interleague games _ are Atlanta, Boston, Chicago,
Cincinnati, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Kansas City, Los Angeles,
Miami, Milwaukee, Montreal, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix,
Pittsburgh, St. Louis, San Diego and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The money will be donated by the Starbucks Foundation, a
non-profit corporate foundation supporting charitable causes in
communities where Starbucks conducts business. The foundation has
issued more than 100 grants totaling more than $600,000 since its
inception in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Underlying all of this is the fact that I'm so moved by who he
is and how he views his personal responsibility,'' Schultz said of
McGwire. ``I'm also touched by his love of Starbucks coffee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Together, he and I really feel we can make a difference this
season,'' he said. ``We're really enthused about this project.''

STOCK PRICES RISE WITH A SHIFT TOWARD FINANCIAL SHARES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices rebounded Thursday as attention shifted
from technology to insurance and other financial shares after a
Dutch company said it would pay a large premium to buy
Transamerica.
</P>
<P>
   Technology shares, which have dominated market gyrations for
weeks, took something of a breather in the aftermath of Dell
Computer's report late Tuesday of disappointing sales growth and
finished mixed. Dell climbed 1 7/16, to 83, as trading subsided to
33.8 million shares, 30 percent of Wednesday's staggering level,
while Microsoft fell 4\, to 145}.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 103.16 points, or 1.12
percent, to 9,298.63. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index climbed
13.25 points, or 1.08 percent, to 1,237.28, while the
technology-laden Nasdaq market rose 11.64 points, or 0.5 percent,
to 2,260.55.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts called the performance, which pushed the Dow into the
middle of the 9,100 to 9,500 range in which it has traded for more
than a month, somewhat encouraging in that it came despite the
competition from rising interest rates in the credit markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The domestic economy is doing just fine,'' said Peter H.
Havens, executive vice president and chief investment officer at
the Bryn Mawr Trust Co., citing fresh government reports on jobs,
inflation and Philadelphia-area business activity.
</P>
<P>
   And some analysts argue that the market is poised for a further
rebound. Decliners on the New York Stock Exchange surpassed
advancing issues over the preceding 10 sessions by about 4,800,
more than twice the 2,000 margin that implies a short-term market
rise, said Laszlo Birinyi of Birinyi Associates.
</P>
<P>
   This, he concluded, means that ``we're still oversold.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest advances in the Dow were by IBM, up 3}, to 174\;
General Motors, up 3, to 85 9/16; Alcoa, up 2~, to 81 15/16, and
McDonald's, up 2 7/16, to 82 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   Of the eight losers, only Caterpillar, down 1 1/16, to 44 13/16,
lost more than a fraction.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance stocks were a standout, spurred by the Dutch company
Aegon's $78 bid for Transamerica, which jumped 15\, to 72~. The
combined company would be the third-biggest life insurer in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson Pilot gained 4[, to 70\; Lincoln National rose 4, to
88]; American General jumped 3~, to 70 1/16; Equitable climbed 2
15/16, to 66 15/16; Allstate rose 2 5/16, to 38 9/16; Conseco was
up 2, to 29, and Berkshire Hathaway rose 495, to 71,700.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman Brothers, up 3[, to 50 1/16, along with Merrill Lynch and
Charles Schwab, each up more than 2, led a strong brokerage group
while among banks, J.P. Morgan, BankAmerica, Republic, First Union
and Bank One all gained more than a point.
</P>
<P>
   Drug stocks were aided by a better-than-expected profit report
by Glaxo Wellcome, which rose 1 9/16, to 66 1/16. Lilly's gain was
biggest, up 4~, to 93].
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three stocks gained for every two that fell on the New
York Stock Exchange _ 1,766 to 1,255. But 145 made new 52-week lows
while only 28 made new highs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The breadth is not that great,'' said Walter Murphy, a senior
analyst at Merrill Lynch. ``It still smacks of being a narrow
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Wilshire 5000 index that includes nearly every stock,
gained nearly 1 percent, almost matching the advances in the Dow
and the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   Big Board volume edged up to a still-moderate 742.5 million
shares, from 735.1 million on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's gain was aided by a recommendation by a Merrill Lynch
analyst who raised his target price to 100 within 12 months. Intel,
the No. 1 maker of computer chips, was reiterated a buy by
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette and rose 3{, to 128[. But Chase
Manhattan was downgraded by Prudential Securities and slumped a
point, to 76.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, main stock indexes fell 1.26 percent in Brazil and by
negligible percentages in Japan and Britain. Markets in Germany and
France rose 1.1 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively.

 &HT;    Ohio governor denies clemency for murderer
 &HT;    By Tom Beyerlein
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Gov. Bob Taft on Thursday denied clemency for
Wilford Lee Berry Jr., making it more likely that Ohio will carry
out its first execution since 1963 at 9 p.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have compassion for Mr. Berry because of his extremely
unfortunate life circumstances which may have contributed to his
criminal tendencies,'' Taft said in a four-page statement he wrote
personally. ``I'm also most respectful of the deep sincerity of the
views of the Ohio Catholic Conference (which sought clemency) and
many others who have expressed their opposition to the death
penalty and to the execution of Mr. Berry.''
</P>
<P>
   Taft added, though: ``In reviewing the entire record I find no
compelling reason to grant clemency in this case.'' He cited:
</P>
<P>
   _ The crime's ``heinous'' nature.
</P>
<P>
   _ The jury's verdict.
</P>
<P>
   _ The ``thorough and detailed'' appeals process that upheld
Berry's murder conviction.
</P>
<P>
   _ Berry's admission of guilt.
</P>
<P>
   _ Court rulings that found Berry competent to waive further
appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Therefore,'' Taft wrote, ``the request for clemency is
respectfully denied.''
</P>
<P>
   Taft, sworn in as governor Jan. 11, declined to be interviewed.
A spokesman, Scott Milburn, said the governor will not be changing
his mind on the clemency request.
</P>
<P>
   The Most Rev. Daniel E. Pilarczyk, archbishop of the Cincinnati
archdiocese, who had met with Taft to urge clemency, issued a
statement regretting Taft's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I continue to be convinced that the death penalty is a relic
of barbarism in our society and is, as Pope John Paul II said in
St. Louis last month, 'both cruel and unnecessary,''' Pilarczyk
said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, the full 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and
the Ohio Supreme Court refused to stop the execution, rejecting
last-ditch legal appeals filed by the Ohio public defender's office
on behalf of Berry's mother and sister.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant public defender Jon Woodman said his office has
already filed paperwork for a final appeal, to the U.S. Supreme
Court. Public defenders also have filed paperwork with U.S.
District Judge Algenon Marbley, in case Berry changes his mind and
decides to continue his appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Berry, 36, is known as ``the Volunteer'' because he is not
appealing his death sentence and says he would rather die than
spend the rest of his life in prison for the 1989 robbery-murder of
his boss, Cleveland baker Charles Mitroff Jr. Berry has a long
history of mental problems but has repeatedly been found legally
competent.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio attorney general's office is arguing that no further
competency hearings are needed and the execution should proceed.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Taft said, ``since he spoke to the jury in the
mitigation stage of his criminal trial, Mr. Berry has been
consistent in his desire to allow the death sentence to be carried
out. His reasoning is logical. He states that he would prefer to be
out of prison and back on the streets. However, because it is
likely that further appeals would only delay his ultimate
execution, Mr. Berry prefers to proceed with the execution now.
Even if his appeals would be successful, he has no desire to spend
the rest of his life in prison. These sentiments are not unusual
among death row inmates across the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry is to be executed in the maximum-security Southern Ohio
Correctional Facility at Lucasville at 9 p.m. today. He chose to be
killed by lethal injection rather than electrocution. The lethal
injection apparatus was tested Wednesday, said Andrea Dean, a
spokeswoman for the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and
Correction.
</P>
<P>
   Berry has been held at the Correctional Medical Center, the
prison hospital near Columbus, since he was beaten by other inmates
in a September 1997 riot on death row at Mansfield Correctional
Institution. Public defenders say Berry is no longer competent
because of head injuries he suffered in the riot, but prison mental
health experts say he shows no signs of mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   He will be moved to Lucasville at an undisclosed time today.
</P>
<P>
   Dean said Berry will select his last meal this morning and it
will be served between noon and 3 p.m. He will have a chance to
shower and be allowed to have clergy with him today up until about
15 minutes before he is escorted to the execution chamber. He will
be given an opportunity to write a last statement, to be read by
Lucasville Warden Stephen Huffman just prior to the lethal
injection, Dean said. If Berry makes a statement, it will be given
to the news media after Berry is pronounced dead, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Berry's mother, Jennie Franklin, has asked to claim his body and
will be responsible for funeral arrangements, Dean said.
</P>
<P>
   Berry was less than two hours from being executed last March 3
when, as he was being transported from the prison hospital to
Lucasville, he was granted a reprieve from the U.S. Supreme Court,
which refused to lift an earlier stay of execution issued by the
6th Circuit court. The appeals court later ruled that the Ohio
Supreme Court used the proper standard to determine Berry's
competency and said the execution could be rescheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Death penalty opponents will protest outside the prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just feel it's wrong and we feel it's important for
somebody to witness to that,'' said organizer Jana Schroeder. The
public is invited to go along.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure nobody who's standing out there (protesting) against
it has buried three children to murder,'' countered Madge Burton of
Butler County, whose two daughters and granddaughter were murdered
in 1984 by Rhett DePew, who awaits execution.
</P>
<P>
   Burton, who plans to go to Lucasville in support of Berry's
execution, said ``it's just finalizing something that should have
happened a long time ago. If you have a death penalty, it should be
enforced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a society where there are evil people. We have to
have a maximum penalty for the ultimate crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Taft, in his statement, thanked all those who wrote or called
his office, ``including the family of the victim and members of the
clergy.''
</P>
<P>
   He concluded: ``May God bless the family of Charles Mitroff. I
pray that this decision will allow them to find peace of mind and
closure in the face of their loss.

 &HT;    Digital services boost Cox Communications
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Cox Communications' effort to sell new digital
services has begun to gain momentum, helping boost the company's
fourth-quarter results.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based company had sold at least one of its three
digital services _ digital TV, high-speed access to the Internet
and telephone service _ to more than 150,000 of its 3.7 million
customers nationwide as of Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   In fourth-quarter results announced Thursday, Cox Communications
said it expected the number of digital service customers to reach
500,000 by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Communications President and Chief Executive Jim Robbins
described the pace of digital sales as ``a very encouraging early
sign of hearty consumer demand.''
</P>
<P>
   The demand for digital services helped drive fourth-quarter
revenue to $486.7 million, up 13 percent from $431.9 million a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Net income was $317.9 million, or $1.13 a share, compared with a
loss of $77.9 million, or 29 cents a share, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The latest quarter included two big one-time gains. A gain of
$769.5 million resulted from the conversion of the company's stake
in Sprint PCS to a publicly traded tracking stock. The second gain
of $30.4 million was from the sale of 3.3 million shares of AT&AMP;T
stock. Cox Communications received the stock when AT&AMP;T bought out
its stake in telephone service provider Teleport Communications
Group.
</P>
<P>
   Operating cash flow, a key indicator of a cable company's
health, was $199.1 million in the fourth quarter. That represented
an 8 percent increase from $185 million a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest news, though, was the quickening pace of digital
sales. The company is offering these services through its new
two-way digital networks. It's part of the company's strategy to
expand beyond cable TV into a full service telecommunications
provider.
</P>
<P>
   As of Dec. 31, the company had launched digital television in
seven markets and had 74,843 customers. Customers choosing Cox
Communications' Internet access totaled 67,069. Those using
telephone service numbered 27,819 in six states.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Communications is controlled by Atlanta-based Cox
Enterprises Inc., which also owns The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

 &HT;    FAA orders 1,000 aging 727s inspected for joint fatgiue cracks
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Federal Aviation Administration has ordered
inspections of 1,000 aging Boeing 727s for skin joint fatigue
cracks, a problem first found at Delta Air Lines.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA on Thursday said Atlanta-based Delta recently discovered
joint cracks in five 727s, prompting the agency to order
industrywide inspections.
</P>
<P>
   The problem isn't deemed serious enough to warrant groundings or
urgent inspections, but a crack could expand and eventually cause a
rapid cabin decompression.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines have 15 days to perform visual inspections and 60 days
to do electronic tests for invisible cracks.
</P>
<P>
   The venerable 727 is a workhorse of the airline fleet. Delta has
125, more than any other passenger carrier, but plans to replace
them with new planes by 2005. One hundred of its 727s fall under
the inspection order.
</P>
<P>
   A Delta spokesman said mechanics found fatigue cracking at ``lap
joints'' on the belly of a jet, where overlapping sections of
fuselage are riveted together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We discovered cracks on one plane and then began looking at
others and notified the FAA,'' spokesman Bill Berry said.
</P>
<P>
   Delta already has completed visual inspections and is halfway
through the electronic testing, Berry said. Repairs have been made
to the planes where cracks were found, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Berry said the problem ``is not something that would normally
cause an accident if there was a failure.'' But a sudden
decompression would force an emergency descent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd have a lot of uncomfortable people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA praised Delta for quickly alerting it to the problem and
helping to design the inspection regimen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Delta's been very helpful in working this issue,'' FAA
spokesman Mitch Barker said. The FAA said the order falls under a
program to ensure the structural safety of aging planes.
</P>
<P>
   The inspection order applies to three early types of 727s. Those
planes average 25 years old and about 38,000 cycles, or takeoffs
and landings, the FAA said.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, 1,516 727s fall under the order, 1,000 of them
U.S.-registered. The FAA cannot force foreign users to comply with
its directives, but typically they do. The FAA pegged the combined
cost of visual and electronic testing at $2,880 per airplane.

 &HT;    Digital age challenges acknowledged at interactive newspapers
conference
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It takes a village to build a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   That was the consensus at the early morning sessions Thursday of
Editor and Publisher magazine's Interactive Newspapers '99
conference at the Hyatt Regency Atlanta. More than 1,300
journalists from around the country and around the world gathered
here to find out how to bring traditional paper newspapers into the
digital age with style and on a budget.
</P>
<P>
   GeoCities chairman and founder David Bohnett,
(http://www.geocities.com) and Tripod founder Bo Peabody
(http://www.tripod.com) talked to a near-capacity crowd about the
importance of building and fostering online communities. Both said
newspapers that give users the opportunity to build Web sites will
also drive traffic to the newspaper's own content.
</P>
<P>
   ``People get as much information from each other as they do from
traditional news sources,'' said Tripod's Peabody. ``It doesn't
displace editors or writers or anything else. What personal Web
pages do is give people the ability to exchange information with
each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Added GeoCities Bohnett, ``Newspapers have the opportunity to
wrap user feedback around content and give users the opportunity to
interact.''
</P>
<P>
   AccessAtlanta (http://www.accessatlanta.com) has developed a
strong community area with templates allowing users to create pages
for everything from the local PTA to college football teams and
personal hobbies. News stories on the Access Atlanta site typically
include relevant community links. (AccessAtlanta is part of Cox
Interactive Media, a unit of Atlanta-based Cox Enterprises Inc.,
which also owns The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.)
</P>
<P>
   While there are concerns about quality of user-based information
versus newspaper content, Bohnett said Internet users are savvy
enough to understand where the news they get comes from. ``We have
to respect the level of credibility they assign to any piece of
information they get.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the question of how to make money selling anything to
consumers online is still one of online publishing's greatest
challenges. ``I can't figure out how to make money selling to the
consumer,'' said keynote speaker Michael Bloomberg, founder and CEO
of Bloomberg News. ``If you can figure out how to do it, you're the
only one in the room.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Find information that nobody else has, that people want,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg dismissed the idea archives and databases were the key
to online newspaper success. ``Nobody cares who won the
Medford/Malden high school football game in 1987,'' he said. ``What
they do want to know is if the next door neighbor's kid scored a
touchdown last week.''
</P>
<P>
   The key, he said, is to bring local content and the unique
perspective every newspaper has to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg noted newspapers already have a personal presence in
their communities or ``feet on the street'' as he called it. He
said personal contact and support were vital to the success of any
online venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most online ventures should be better staffed,'' he said,
``but that conflicts with the business models of most new media
companies. Newspapers have the people built right in.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference, which started Wednesday, ends after its Saturday
sessions.

LEWINSKY IS ALLOWED TO TALK

<P>
   The independent counsel Kenneth Starr has agreed to allow Monica
Lewinsky to go forward with her interview with Barbara Walters, but
has placed restrictions on what she may say, people with knowledge
of the terms of Ms. Lewinsky's agreement with ABC News said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-minute interview will be conducted on Saturday in
Manhattan and almost certainly will be broadcast on March 3,
starting at 9:30 p.m., the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky is forbidden to give any details of her initial
questioning by the independent counsel's office.
</P>
<P>
   St. Martin's Press will begin selling the book on Ms. Lewinsky
written by Andrew Morton, with her cooperation, on March 4, people
with knowledge of the publisher's plans said. They said that the
book is not subject to the same restrictions as the television
interview, apparently because it does not fall under the definition
of a ``news organization,'' the specific language used in Ms.
Lewinsky's immunity agreement with the independent counsel's
office.
</P>
<P>
   Starr also decided on Thursday to permit Channel 4, a television
station in Great Britain, to broadcast its own interview with Ms.
Lewinsky, most likely on March 4, people familiar with that
agreement said. Channel 4 has agreed to pay Ms. Lewinsky $600,000
for the interview.
</P>
<P>
   ABC executives and Ms. Walters have said that Ms. Lewinsky was
not being paid for her interview.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives for Ms. Lewinsky declined to comment, as did
executives from ABC. The Office of Independent Counsel did not
return phone calls Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky was blocked from speaking to news organizations
under the immunity agreement she signed in exchange for her
testimony in Starr's investigation of President Clinton. The
agreement stipulated that Ms. Lewinsky could not be interviewed
pending final resolution of the Clinton case.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers had been in negotiations with Starr's
office to free her to speak to Ms. Walters, who said she has been
prepared to conduct the interview since last November.
</P>
<P>
   ABC is not a party to the agreement between Starr and Ms.
Lewinsky, executives close to the network's arrangement with Ms.
Lewinsky said Thursday.

 &HT;    GM plans call center in Austin
 &HT;    By Earl Golz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ More than 500 new jobs are slated to come to
Austin in June when General Motors Corp. opens a new customer
service center near Austin-Bergstrom International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the new employees will be hired locally by Sitel Corp.
of Baltimore, which will operate the 103,000-square-foot
telecommunications center for GM. The auto manufacturer will move
as many as 40 supervisors from Michigan to Austin for the center.
</P>
<P>
   As part of Sitel's five-year agreement with GM, another GM
center will open in Tampa, Fla., in May and a third will open later
in a location that has not been chosen. Sitel will operate the
three call centers.
</P>
<P>
   GM is retooling its service centers so that each will have
employees trained to provide information about any GM vehicle owned
by customers who will use a toll-free telephone number.
</P>
<P>
   Concurrent with the opening of the three centers, GM is closing
five customer service centers in Michigan, each of which
traditionally has handled service calls for a specific GM vehicle
brand, such as Chevrolet, Buick, Oldsmobile or Cadillac.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a matter of what all businesses are doing these
days,'' said GM spokeswoman Anne Marie Sylvester. ``It's
streamlining, running more efficiently and cutting costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of the new service centers is in a different time zone,
allowing the centers to be staffed 24 hours a day and providing a
greater diversity of service during normal business hours.
</P>
<P>
   With the centers, GM plans to provide customers with ``one-stop
resolution for any task, at any level, for any brand, in one place,
in one call,'' said Howard Christie, of GM's customer and
relationship services group in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The GM center will be part of a 193-acre development, the Met
Center, planned on either side of Riverside Drive near Ben White
Boulevard and U.S. 183.
</P>
<P>
   Other plans for Met Center include a 144-room La Quinta Inn &AMP;
Suites, to be completed next month, five other hotels, three
restaurants and a 57,000-square-foot office building.

JET CREW MEMBER DESCRIBES FLIGHT THAT CUT GONDOLA CABLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Ohio)  (js) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. _ A crew member of the Marine Corps jet that
severed a gondola cable, plunging 20 people to their deaths in the
Italian Alps last year, gave the first public description of the
shocked and fearful reaction in the cockpit as he testified at the
pilot's court-martial Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The witness, Capt. Chandler P. Seagraves, said that when the
plane's right wing cut the cable, the other back seat crew member,
Capt. William L. Raney II, grabbed him by the front of his flight
suit and shook him, trying to draw his attention to the wing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see through his visor,'' Seagraves said of Raney,
``his eyes were real big.''
</P>
<P>
   In a rearview mirror designed for watching for enemy fighters,
he could see pieces falling off the tail, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Seagraves said he clutched the handle for his ejection seat, and
did so again later when he feared that the plane would crash on
landing on the runway at Aviano, Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The impact with the cable ``was like a thud, a vibration in the
aircraft, and then that was it.''
</P>
<P>
   Seagraves began to cry as he testified about being told by a
psychologist and his commanding officer of the deaths on the
ground. The four marines aboard the jet were under a suicide watch
for a few weeks after the accident on Feb. 3, 1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Seagraves, of Nineveh, Ohio, is testifying for prosecutors under
a grant of immunity in the trial of the pilot, Capt. Richard J.
Ashby, on charges of negligence. But Seagraves appeared to undercut
several of the prosecution's arguments about the accident, and
backed the pilot's contention that he had not intended to fly too
low but the warning system had failed.
</P>
<P>
   The cable was at about 360 feet and the jet, an EA-6B Prowler,
was supposed to fly 1,000 feet above the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Seagraves said he was impressed by Ashby's decision to have the
safety alarm on the radar altimeter, which shows altitude above the
ground, go off when the plane was 200 feet below that target level.
He said that if the alarm was set at 1,000 feet, it would go off
too frequently, and crew members would ignore it. With the alarm
set for 800 feet, he said, ``guys don't become tone-deaf, and stop
hearing the tone when it goes off.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said the radar altimeter acted erratically a few minutes
after the flight began, but then seemed to recover, leading the
pilot to continue the low-level training mission.
</P>
<P>
   Seagraves also said that the navigator, Captain Joseph P.
Schweitzer, who faces court-martial next month, ``had a very good
plan'' for the flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd obviously done some studying how he was going to navigate
this aircraft through these valleys,'' said Seagraves. They made a
point of climbing to a higher, safer altitude in an area where they
believed that parasailers and paragliders would be present, and
around other known obstructions, he said. The cable they hit was
not on U.S. maps.
</P>
<P>
   Seagraves said that he gathered from talk between the pilot and
navigator that Ashby was ``having a little trouble with the radar
altimeter.'' He climbed to a higher altitude, descended again and
``he said that the radar altimeter was tracking again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember him specifically saying, `We're going to
continue,' but he continued the low level,'' Seagraves said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you voice any concern about that?'' asked one of the
prosecutors. ``No sir, I didn't,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a civilian employee of the Marines who observed a
test of the radar altimeter in a laboratory after the accident
showed a videotape of that test, and showed how the altimeter had
``stuck,'' at one point indicating an altitude of 650 feet when it
should have read 500. A previous investigation concluded that the
radar altimeter was functioning correctly, but the testimony
Thursday and on Tuesday may convince the jury of eight Marine
officers that the device was behaving erratically.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby and Schweitzer also face charges that they hid or
destroyed a videotape that they shot during the flight, but
Seagraves, who gave prosecutors most of their information about the
tape, said Thursday that he believed from conversations in the
cockpit that the two officers in the front seat stopped taping
before the relevant part of the training flight.

AMERICAN PILOTS CHIEF HOPES TO REACH ACCORD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PETE ALFANO 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Rich LaVoy, president of the Allied Pilots
Association, said Thursday that although little progress has been
made on the core issues in the dispute with American Airlines, he
hopes that a settlement can be reached before April 12, when the
two sides are to appear before U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall.
</P>
<P>
   That is when Kendall has said he will determine the total fines
to be levied against the union for defying a court order to end a
sickout that crippled airline operations Feb. 6 through Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somewhere along the line, you have to reach across the table
and say yes,'' LaVoy said. ``It's the hardest word to say in
negotiations. But I can't see any reason why this can't be settled
in six weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute centers on how and when to integrate the 300 pilots
from Reno Air into American's 9,300-member pilot corps. American
acquired control of the small West Coast carrier Dec. 23.
</P>
<P>
   But the animosity between American and the union goes back many
years.
</P>
<P>
   In a two-hour interview Thursday, LaVoy and Brian Mayhew, vice
president of the pilots union, said distrust of management runs
deep throughout the pilot corps. They called it a legacy from
Robert Crandall, the hard-nosed chief executive of AMR, American's
parent company, who retired in May and was replaced by Don Carty.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Carty's proclamations that he wants to improve
communications with employees, the union leaders said they have
seen scant evidence that management's approach to labor has changed
under Carty.
</P>
<P>
   They said they view the acquisition of Reno Air as a case in
point. LaVoy and Mayhew suggested that management could have done a
better job of communicating plans to buy Reno, re-establishing
American's presence on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're stakeholders in the airline and have a greater
investment than the shareholders,'' LaVoy said. ``We want to see
the airline succeed and prosper.''
</P>
<P>
   LaVoy and Mayhew acknowledged, however, that they found it
difficult to reverse the momentum created when pilots began a
sickout Feb. 6, likening it to a ``runaway train'' and a ``brush
fire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Once it started, it was phenomenally difficult to get it going
back the other way,'' Mayhew said.
</P>
<P>
   The airline obtained a temporary restraining order Feb. 10, but
pilots defied the order for two days, with the sick list exceeding
2,400 on Feb. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall found the union in contempt and levied a $10 million
fine Saturday as a down payment toward total fines and damages.
</P>
<P>
   American officials testified Wednesday that losses during the
period the pilots were found in contempt were $58.7 million. The
losses for the entire sickout, including the period before the
pilots were ordered back to work, totaled $150 million, the airline
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall granted the union a continuance Wednesday, giving it
until April 12 to review American's damage claims.
</P>
<P>
   LaVoy and Mayhew were careful in the interview not to make any
comments that might provoke the court.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots began the sickout because they believe that American's
plan to slowly integrate Reno pilots into the American system is a
violation of the so-called scope clause of their contract with the
airline. That clause stipulates that all flying by the airline, or
on behalf of the airline, by any affiliate, must be done by pilots
on the American seniority list.
</P>
<P>
   The union wants Reno's pilots to be paid on American's higher
pay scale retroactive to Dec. 23. The union is also demanding that
American first officers who will be promoted to captain as a result
of the Reno acquisition be paid captain's wages retroactive to Dec.
23.
</P>
<P>
   American has declined to budge on those issues, although it has
offered to increase compensation for Reno pilots. A spokesman for
American said there has been no movement by the pilots since
negotiations resumed this week.
</P>
<P>
   LaVoy and Mayhew said that ``99 percent'' of the pilots
understand and support the union's position on key issues, although
some might not have agreed with the union's tactics.
</P>
<P>
   They also said the union could not avoid public relations damage
from the sickout. The public's primary interest is uninterrupted
travel, they noted, so any job action won't be popular.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, they said they realize that pilots earn enough
money that it's hard to elicit sympathy for their cause. The
average salary of an American pilot is $150,000, and many senior
captains make more than $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Lavoy and Mayhew said the pilots would have been willing to
negotiate a ``bridge'' agreement that would have permitted an
exception to the scope clause while a more comprehensive deal was
worked out.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders said they are looking for signs that management
will change the approach of the Crandall years and treat pilots
with more respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``If management will understand that the pilots were and are
sincere about trying to negotiate solutions to these things, and if
they will be sensitive to what we tell them are core issues, rather
than simply focusing on the financial bottom line, then I think
that there can be a positive outcome here,'' Mayhew said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they do what they've done in the past, which is to simply
be dismissive of the association and its leadership,'' he said,
``then they'll continue to make the same mistakes they've made with
every employee group on the property.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NOVATO, Calif. _ Last September, Adam Colton was jumped and
beaten a week after he declared that he was gay and formed the
Gay-Straight Alliance at San Marin High School here.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, he was ambushed again. Colton, a 17-year-old
senior, woke bruised and cut in a hospital bed, unable to remember
who had beaten him, or where or when. Only the reason was obvious _
announced by the letters FAG scratched on his stomach and arms with
a pen.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks on Colton _ who may not return to San Marin High
School, his father said _ have led to considerable outrage in this
Marin County town. But they have also led to considerable
soul-searching.
</P>
<P>
   In the San Francisco Bay area, Marin County is considered a kind
of resting home for old hippies and New Age followers, a place that
prides itself on live-and-let-live tolerance. But Colton's case,
which occurred 30 miles north of San Francisco, the city with the
largest openly gay population in the country, was not the first
time bias attacks had occurred in recent years at his school or in
his town.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday parents of four black students from a high school in
Mill Valley, 15 miles south of Novato, announced that they were
suing the Novato school district over a racial incident last
February at a varsity basketball game at San Marin, when white
students watching the game wore face paint and Afro wigs, and
chanted racial epithets.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Price, an Oakland civil rights lawyer representing some
of the black students, said it had become clear since the incident
that the school district was not doing enough to change the climate
of intolerance at San Marin.
</P>
<P>
   While the basketball team has been put on probation, she said,
it was still allowed to play and was not penalized in any other
way.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Price said her clients ``really don't feel comfortable
playing there,'' adding: ``It's been difficult. Unfortunately, San
Marin High School has a long history of this kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Novato, a mostly white, middle-class town on the northern, rural
side of Marin County, has been in the news time and again in the
last several years over bias incidents at the 1,200-student school
or elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, a fourth-generation Asian-American senior at San Marin
was beaten by a group of teen-agers who shouted racial slurs and
told him to go back to China. One teen-ager took responsibility and
was sentenced to 20 hours of community service.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, a white Novato man who stabbed an Asian man because of
his race became the first person in Marin County to be convicted of
a felony hate crime.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, days after the incident at the basketball game,
swastikas and other hate graffiti began appearing on San Marin
walls, and students were scolded by school officials for performing
a racially insensitive skit at a school talent show.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, people have painted Novato as a county aberration _
a place where such things happen. But Cynthia Murray, a Marin
County supervisor from Novato, said that perception was not
reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that is happening is that we take hate
crimes very seriously,'' Ms. Murray said. ``It has given us a
reputation for having bias incidents. We sort of get punished for
reporting every incident that other towns wouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayme Hubert, chairwoman of the Marin County Human Rights
Commission, said that there were flare-ups of intolerance all over
the county from time to time. But Ms. Hubert disputed the notion
that Novato merely reported crimes more assiduously than other
towns.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are all the other towns managing to keep it so muffled?''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   After last year's incident at the basketball game, groups of
students at San Marin organized a discussion on race and ethnic
issues with students from Tamalpais High School, their opponents in
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Two clubs, Diversity Core Group and Other People's Cultures,
were formed at San Marin to address race-related issues, and the
school and district organized a multicultural rally and sensitivity
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday morning, more than 1,000 students and members of the
staff and the faculty walked out of San Marin in a show of support
for Colton and to show pride in their school.
</P>
<P>
   Rod Wood, the Novato city manager, said that despite those
efforts, a small group of students at San Marin identified
themselves as white supremacists and called themselves ``the
hicks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that we have a small group of individuals who are
fairly socially maladjusted,'' Wood said. ``It keeps leading back
to the same kids _ where this attitude comes from, particularly in
Marin County, I don't know. The community itself is really hurt and
outraged by the events. God help the kids who hurt Colton, because
when we find them, they're going to be prosecuted to the fullest
extent.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Colton, who transferred to San Marin in September, has said he
was taunted and harassed many times since declaring that he was
gay.
</P>
<P>
   The first time he was attacked was by three teen-agers he could
not identify, in a supermarket parking lot. On another occasion, he
said, someone wrote an epithet in lighter fluid on his family's
driveway and tried to ignite it. Repeatedly, he received hateful
looks and comments from students who passed him in the hallways.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, exhausted by the hatred, he entered an
independent study program and began attending just two classes at
San Marin, creative writing and drama.
</P>
<P>
   Students at the school said they were bothered by what had
happened, but considered it rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's really terrible,'' said Angela Stanger, a
14-year-old freshman. ``I went to the Gay-Straight Alliance meeting
after he got beat up last year. He really struck me as a bright guy
who wanted to change things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of cliques here but this is really out of the
ordinary,'' said Grace Le Maitre, a 15-year-old sophomore. ``Things
don't usually go to that extent even if people don't get along.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Tassano, the San Marin principal, whom the Coltons
criticized for not putting a stop to the harassment after the first
attack, was reassigned Thursday to a district office.
</P>
<P>
   John Bernard, the district superintendent, said Tassano had been
moved ``because of all the issues'' at the school. He said it was
not clear whether Colton was assaulted on or off campus last
Friday, or by students or others.
</P>
<P>
   Colton's car was found locked in the school parking lot, the
police said, suggesting that he had been beaten on the campus.
Students said he had wandered into a classroom after the attack,
saying something about having been followed, and passed out.

   ``I do not believe that San Marin has a problem,'' said Bernard,
who became superintendent in January. But, he said, the public
perceives that there is a problem, ``and since perception is
reality for many people, we have to do things so we can eliminate
that.''

 &HT;    Georgia officials hopeful for SUV emissions limits
 &HT;    By David Goldberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Smog-plagued areas of Georgia would get federal
backing in meeting air quality standards under tough, nationwide
vehicle-emissions limits under consideration by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA is set to propose tighter standards for sport utility
and other heavy vehicles, which currently face far less stringent
limits than passenger cars, The Associated Press reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA is expected to submit a draft of the proposed
regulations within days for final review by the White House, the AP
said, citing unnamed sources. The package would require oil
companies to produce cleaner gasoline by cutting sulfur content by
better than 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, state environmental officials said tighter pollution
rules for motor vehicles and for gasoline are essential if metro
Atlanta and other areas are to meet federal health standards for
smog and microscopic soot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Georgia was one of the states that urged the EPA to adopt
low-sulfur gasoline and stricter tailpipe standards nationwide,''
said Harold Reheis, director of the Georgia Environmental
Protection Division. ``If they're thinking about tightening
standards for SUVs, I think that's great.''
</P>
<P>
   About a third of the vehicles in metro Atlanta are SUVs, pickups
or vans. Their heavier engines have had to meet less stringent
emissions targets than passenger cars, said Marlin Gottschalk, who
heads EPD's emissions testing program.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA proposal specifies nationwide tailpipe emission
standards similar to those adopted for 2004 by California,
according to industry and environmental sources briefed on the
draft proposal. Vehicle fleets would have to reduce emissions of
smog-causing chemicals by almost 90 percent from those of today's
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, SUVs, pickups and minivans would be required
to meet about the same emissions caps as cars, but they would be
given two more years of phase-in time.
</P>
<P>
   While Ford has touted its SUVs as being as clean as today's
cars, many of the larger SUVs emit three to four times as much
smog-causing pollution as cars, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   In metro Atlanta, highway sources account for about half the
emissions of nitrogen oxide, the critical component of smog
formation in the region. The rapid growth in miles driven in the
area, coupled with the surge in SUVs and other heavier vehicles,
has presented a huge challenge to officials trying to meet air
quality standards.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, Atlanta was to have met smog standards this
year, but state officials acknowledge that will be impossible. The
region will be unable to spend federal funds on new road projects
until it has a federally approved plan to meet vehicle emissions
targets.

DRAGGING DEATH DEFENDANT BOASTED OF PLANS TO KILL A BLACK, WITNESS
SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ In prison, John William King boasted that he
would abduct a black man after his release, ``put him in the trunk
of a car, take him out into the woods and kill him,'' a former
friend and inmate testified on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   That conversation eerily paralleled the prosecution's contention
that King and two other men kidnapped James Byrd Jr., on June 7,
chained him behind a pickup, then dragged him three miles until he
was dead and dismembered. King is charged with capital murder in
Byrd's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The killing proves your loyalty to an organization,'' Mattheww
Hoover testified yesterday. ``You have to spill blood to get in and
give blood to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoover said King spoke hopefully of an incident ``like the
Rodney King beating'' in Los Angeles that would trigger rioting and
eventually lead to a full-blown race war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Hoover had the most dramatic impact today,'' District
Attorney Guy James Gray told reporters after court. ``He described
how Bill King came about his racial feelings, where he picked up
his habits.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray said that the kidnap-slaying of Byrd could either have been
a ``blood initiation'' for King or one for Shawn Berry, a new
recruit to the Confederate Knights of America and one of the three
men accused in Byrd's death.
</P>
<P>
   The third defendant, Lawrence Russell Brewer, already was a
Confederate Knights member, Gray said. Brewer and Berry will be
tried later on capital murder charges. King has denied any part in
the slaying, saying that Berry killed Byrd over a soured drug deal.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys repeatedly stressed that prison transformed
King into a racist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roughly 25 months he was in the penitentiary ... showed the
reasons he has the tattoos, why he has the attitude he has now,
which witnesses testified he did not have before he went to
penitentiary,'' said attorney Brack Jones of Beaumont.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it mitigates,'' Jones said. ``Our system caused his
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Faulk, a childhood friend of King, testified yesterday
that King only began objecting to socializing with blacks after he
was released from prison. But he recalled that King at 16 was
hospitalized after starting a fight with an African-American.
</P>
<P>
   There was silence yesterday when an FBI agent pulled a
24-foot-long logging chain from a brown sack and extended it across
the front of the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   FBI special agent Norman Townsend said Berry had led
investigators to a hole in a wooded area behind Faulk's trailer
where the chain had been hidden under a piece of plywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was chilling, bone chilling,'' Byrd's sister, Houston
schoolteacher Clara Taylor, said after leaving the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Gray told reporters that witnesses had seen two men clean the
chain at a carwash behind the two-screen cinema, which Berry
managed before his arrest. He said the washing and burying left no
detectable DNA evidence on the chain, which prosecutors contend was
used to drag Byrd to death.
</P>
<P>
   FBI experts testified that tire tracks along the three-mile
crime scene matched the two types of tires on Berry's pickup, and
shoeprints at the scene matched the type of soles on footwear
recovered from the apartment Berry shared with King, Brewer and,
occasionally, Berry's brother Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Hoover, who was subpoenaed from Springfield, Mo., testified with
markedly nervous hesitation. A member of the Aryan Brotherhood when
he was in prison, Hoover said he was testifying against his will
and was risking his life by giving evidence against King.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors introduced into evidence Hoover's prison keepsake
album which included a rambling, racist message from King. At the
end of the undated inscription, King invited his friend to a Jasper
barbecue and ``bashing'' _ prison parlance for a racial assault _
on July 4, 1998, about a month after Byrd's death.
</P>
<P>
   Inside King's apartment, officials found by-laws, a constitution
and statements of beliefs for a Jasper-based hate group, which some
of the documents said would be formed on July 4, 1998. The group
was to be called the Texas Rebel Soldiers Division of the
Confederate Knights of America.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination, Hoover agreed that prison tattoos often
were intended to help an inmate appear more able to defend himself,
particularly a 5-foot-7 white in a unit where 75 percent of the
inmates were black.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, district attorney Gray said King's tattoos of
racist symbols showed hate in the defendant's heart.
</P>
<P>
   Hoover said King often spoke of an inevitable war between the
races and appeared to dislike Jews even more than blacks.
</P>
<P>
   The day before Byrd's kidnap-murder, investigators said, King,
Brewer and Berry broke into Patrick's Steakhouse, the only
Jewish-owned business in the area, stealing $2,500 worth of meat,
lobster tails and liquor.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Lam said he had not considered that he was targeted
because he was Jewish until he heard this week of King's
anti-semitic views. A Holocaust survivor, Lam was born in Lyons,
France, in 1944 and was sheltered by the Catholic church until the
war's end.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ For a decade, Kurds have been coming to Germany seeking
political asylum, and on Thursday one of them, Amin Aram, walked
into the Kurdish Community Center here, took a tea from a friend
and declared, ``Every one of us, without exception, is angry.''
</P>
<P>
   A window cleaner, Aram, 31, is one of 210,000 Kurds who have
come here since 1989, fleeing various forms of violence. Unlike
Abdullah Ocalan, the Kurdish rebel leader arrested by Turkish
agents on Monday, he is from Iraq, not Turkey. He says that he is
no supporter of Ocalan's Kurdish Workers Party.
</P>
<P>
   Such political divisions have long undermined the scattered
Kurds in their battle for a homeland. But for the overwhelming
majority of the estimated 850,000 Kurds now living in Europe,
Ocalan's arrest constitutes a moment when differences are swept
away, however fleetingly, by a shared sense of outrage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American government says Ocalan is a terrorist,'' Aram
said. ``But my family was called `terrorists' by Saddam Hussein
just because we are Kurds. Then he killed my mother, three brothers
and two sisters in a chemical-weapons attack on the town of
Halabja. Whatever group we are from, we cannot accept Ocalan's
arrest.''
</P>
<P>
   Long focused on the problems arising from the fight for new
nation-states in the Balkans, European governments have abruptly
awakened this week to another conflict in their midst, one quietly
fed over many years by a fast-growing Kurdish diaspora in Europe,
which this week revealed an ability to organize, communicate and
act.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Kurds on Thursday ended a three-day occupation of the
Greek Embassy in London and protests in most places abated, tension
remained high.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, where three Kurds were killed by Israeli security
guards on Wednesday as they tried to enter Israel's Berlin
consulate, Kurdish protesters hurled gasoline bombs on Thursday
through the windows of a Turkish cultural center in Heilbronn and
attacked visitors with baseball bats. Three people were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, gasoline bombs were thrown at two Turkish travel
agencies in the port of Bremen, Germany, and Kurdish protesters
forced their way into the regional U.N. headquarters in Vienna,
Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Conversationswith Kurds in several European countries suggest
that the broad show of defiance this week reflected developments
likely to weigh on the continent for some time: the growing
sophistication of Ocalan's movement, which has waged a separatist
war in southeastern Turkey that has left 30,000 dead; anger
stronger than any internal Kurdish differences, and the
helter-skelter growth of a Kurdish population in Europe that had
come to represent a large pool of restive national sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Magnus Ranstorp, an expert on Middle Eastern Affairs at St.
Andrew University in Scotland, said, ``The arrest of Ocalan has
united the Kurdish nation.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``What European governments do not see is that in many
ways the Kurdish struggle reflects the early days of the
Palestinian struggle: putting an issue on the international agenda
through terrorism. The situation could become more and more
inflamed.''
</P>
<P>
   In Greece on Thursday the ministers of foreign affairs, the
interior and public order resigned as public criticism raged over
the country's role in the arrest of Ocalan. And Kenya, where Ocalan
was seized after leaving the Greek Embassy in Nairobi, also
reshuffled its cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest followed several months of detention and flight in
Italy, Russia, Greece and elsewhere _ a fugitive existence for
Ocalan that, it now seems, provided a kind of slow-motion prologue
to the current drama, fueling the Kurds' anger and sense of
abandonment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to warn Western governments this would happen,'' said
Kendal Nezan, the chairman of the moderate Kurdish Institute of
Paris, which opposes the guerrilla tactics of Ocalan's followers.
``I said, `Give Ocalan asylum in exchange for a formal renunciation
of violence.' But the Italian government told me there was too much
diplomatic pressure from America and too much economic pressure
from Turkey.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has defined the Kurdish Workers Party as a
terrorist organization and in recent months has persistently
expressed quiet support for Ocalan's arrest and his handover to
Turkey, which is a critical NATO ally and an important base for
U.S. air patrols over Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Nezan suggested that an effect of U.S. policy and European
governments' acquiescence to it had been to drive moderate Kurds
toward sympathy for Ocalan's violent movement. Kurds, he added, had
become convinced that the strategic importance of Turkey to the
United States was such that no Kurdish claims would ever be
recognized, let alone backed, in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the 850,000 Kurds in the European Union, probably 10
percent are in Ocalan's movement, and some are very militant,'' he
said. ``But a lot of people don't like his methods at all. Still,
in the end they are led to feel sympathy because they are so
revolted by Western policies.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 million Kurds live in an area that sprawls across
southeastern Turkey, Syria, Iran and Iraq. Of these, perhaps 10
million live in Turkey, where they had been promised a homeland in
the 1920 Treaty of Sevres after the fall of the Ottoman Empire. But
plans for a Kurdish homeland were dashed when Mustafa Kemal Ataturk
fought to regain the land.
</P>
<P>
   In Turkey, Kurds are not recognized as a minority, a status that
would allow them to educate their children in their own language. A
ban imposed by Turkey's last military government on the use of the
Kurdish language in unofficial settings was lifted in 1991, but
Kurdish remains illegal in broadcasts or in educational or
political settings, and there is a campaign under way to ban
Turkey's main pro-Kurdish party.
</P>
<P>
   Turks and Kurds have exchanged atrocities in recent years as
Turkey tries to eradicate any Kurdish drive for autonomy or
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Faced by the explosive complexity of recognizing any Kurdish
claims, the frequent ruthlessness of Ocalan's methods and the
importance of Turkey as a NATO ally, Western governments have
generally preferred to look the other way, accepting Kurdish
refugees as a bearable price.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere has that stream of refugees been more intense than in
Germany, which has Europe's most liberal asylum laws. Indeed, with
more than 2 million Turks and about 500,000 Kurds now in the
country, the potential for further violence here is evident.
</P>
<P>
   Ciwan Bahoz, a member of the Kurdish Association for Culture and
Mutual Support, said that, like most Kurds in Germany, he rejected
Ocalan's violent methods. But at the same time he felt enraged by
the way Ocalan was treated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although I reject force, I somehow understand what the
protesters feel,'' he said. ``Ocalan has been humiliated. Europe
now has to understand that if it does not want Kurdish problems
settled on its streets, it must see that its NATO partner, Turkey,
complies with rules that govern any democratic country.''
</P>
<P>
   Like several other Kurds, Bahoz said it would have been far
better if Germany had agreed to try Ocalan, because at least he
would have been assured a fair trial. The German government
declined to request his extradition from Italy to face various
charges because of fear of the potentially explosive domestic
consequences.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   German officials said that the influence of the Kurdish Workers
Party had clearly been growing and that many of the cultural and
other associations in this country were merely fronts for the
organization. Fund raising _ involving pressure on Kurdish stores
and businesses _ was brisk and efficient, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Workers Party was once quite marginal,'' said Barbara
John, Berlin's commissioner for the affairs of foreigners. ``But
the various Kurdish associations have gradually been drawn toward
it. I would not say the party is the mainstream, but it is now the
undisputed representative of the fight for autonomy.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that by being extremely naive in its policies toward
asylum seekers and by failing to recognize that the admission of
hundreds of thousands of Kurds would inevitably have consequences,
Germany now finds itself in a very delicate situation in which
``the question of immigration and foreigners could become really
poisonous.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently aware of this danger of a backlash, Kurdish community
leaders throughout Europe appealed on Thursday for calm. ``We
appeal to our compatriots to behave in a level-headed way,'' said a
statement from the Kurdish Community in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear, however, that if level-headedness was not
conspicuous in recent days, it was not merely because of
spontaneous anger. Faruk Sarhat, a Paris-based member of Ocalan's
movement, said the party's central committee had the means to
quickly contact party cells and Kurdish cultural organizations
throughout the continent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our central committee said protests should be democratic, but
Ocalan is more than our party,'' said Sarhat, who described himself
as a member of the Kurdish Workers Party although he formally
represents a front organization called the Kurdistan National
Liberation Front. ``The kind of anger his arrest generated cannot
be controlled, especially when the role of the Israelis and
Americans was so clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many Kurds, Sarhat argued that Turkey does not have the
resources to swoop on Ocalan and arrest him in the heart of Africa
without assistance from other intelligence services. On Wednesday,
the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, adamantly denied
any Israeli role in Ocalan's capture. The denial by the United
States was less vehement.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the resources of Turkey, those of Kurdish groups in
Europe are clearly considerable, including a Kurdish-language
satellite television channel based in London that appears to have
played an important role in spreading the word of Ocalan's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party is very active in the diaspora extracting money from
Kurds, and the evidence of drug trafficking is also persuasive,''
said Ranstorp, the expert on Middle Eastern affairs. ``It is a
sophisticated, organized guerrilla organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of Ocalan's personal influence was clear this week in
the attempts at self-immolation by several protesters. Like Ho Chi
Minh, of whom he is a great admirer, Ocalan likes to be called
``Uncle'' (``Apo'' in Kurdish), and he frequently called his
followers' attention to the Vietnamese use of immolation as a
method of protest, Nezan said.
</P>
<P>
   But at the time of his arrest, several Kurdish officials said,
he appeared to have been casting around for some kind of political
or diplomatic way out of the cycle of violence. Any possibility of
this now appears to have been dashed, especially if Ocalan's trial
in Turkey should end in a death sentence _ an explosive possibility
for a Europe full of disgruntled Kurds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not support the methods of the Kurdish Workers Party,''
said Kader Al-Yousef, a Kurdish technician in Berlin who came to
Germany as a student 24 years ago from Syria. ``But I cannot
condemn its objective when all it does is fight for our right to a
homeland.''

LONG BEACH STATE TO FACE USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON VERRELL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long Beach State's annual three-day nonconference baseball
slugfest with USC begins tonight at Blair Field with both teams
still striving to live up their lofty preseason billing.
</P>
<P>
   USC, last year's College World Series champion, was ranked No. 1
in the nation in Baseball America's preseason poll, the Dirtbags
No. 2. Yet, after two weeks of the new season, they're a combined
6-9.
</P>
<P>
   This week Baseball America ranks USC No. 6 and Long Beach State
No. 7.
</P>
<P>
   The Dirtbags won two of three games against Baylor to start the
season, then lost two of three last weekend at California. USC is
3-6.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose you could say both teams might have been a little
overrated,'' acknowledged 49er coach Dave Snow. ``At the same time,
it's two teams that are working hard to get things together. Both
teams are hungry, that's for sure. It should be a very competitive
series.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dirtbags certainly hope so. USC has dominated the series
lately, winning 10 of the last 11 games against Long Beach State,
including the last four in a row. The Trojans are 20-9 against the
Dirtbags in Snow's 10-plus seasons as head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It presents us with a great opportunity,'' said Snow.
</P>
<P>
   It also presents 49er left-hander Mike Gallo an opportunity for
some redemption. Last year the Dirtbags opened the season against
USC and Gallo was the 49ers' starter. He lasted only two innings in
a 16-4 loss, giving up three hits and five walks.
</P>
<P>
   In two starts this season Gallo is 1-0 and has given up just
three runs in 12 1/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Gallo will start tonight's 7:05 game at Blair Field, opposing
Trojan left-hander Barry Zito (1-1), who pitched two years ago at
UC Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Trojans' sluggish start to the new season,
All-American catcher Eric Munson has been anything but slow out of
the gate, batting .516 (16 for 31) with five home runs and 17 runs
batted in.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers' Jaeme Leal did start slowly, going two for nine
against Baylor, with five strikeouts. But last week at Cal he
exploded for four home runs including three in one game and is
hitting .333 (eight for 24).
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw some good things at Cal,'' Snow said. ``Certainly, one
of them was Leal breaking out. He's a guy who's going to strike out
some (nine in six games). Last weekend it was either sink or swim,
it seemed. But when he gets his swing going, and he makes good
pitch selections, he's always going to be a threat.''
</P>
<P>
   DIRTBAG NOTES:
</P>
<P>
   The series shifts to USC's Dedeaux Field on Saturday afternoon.
The 49ers' Jeremy Ward (0-0) vs. the Trojans' Rik Currier (1-1)
then returns to Blair Field on Sunday afternoon. ... Right-hander
Jason Berni is scheduled to make his first start for the Dirtbags
on Sunday. ... As a team the Dirtbags are batting .305. Among the
regulars, third baseman Greg Dobbs is hitting .364 (8 for 22),
center fielder Terrmel Sledge .350 (7 for 20) and outfielder Jeff
Jones .346 (9 for 26). ... The first 1,000 fans through the gates
tonight and Sunday will receive a T-shirt commemorating the
Dirtbags' 1998 College World Series appearance.

   REDMOND, Wash. _ Fewer young people say they are willing to
consider military service. The number of veterans on Capitol Hill
declines with each new Congress. The armed services have shrunk,
and military bases are closing.
</P>
<P>
   The military's place in American society is not what it once
was. But has it really come to this? The secretary of defense has
started what he calls ``a very aggressive campaign'' to persuade
the public that the military still matters.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of appearances not normally associated with the
nation's top Defense Department official, Defense Secretary William
Cohen, who himself never served in uniform, is trying to make just
that case. The hope, Cohen says, is to ``reconnect America to its
military'' before what many have portrayed as a widening gap
between the military and civilian cultures becomes a more dangerous
breach.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, he took his campaign to the headquarters of
Microsoft Corp., the computer-software giant whose ranks are filled
with a generation of the sort of educated, innovative young people
who now seem to give little thought to a stint in the all-volunteer
military, let alone a career.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is also a gap that exists between some in this industry
and our military,'' Cohen told some 150 polite and attentive
employees gathered in Building 43 on Microsoft's sprawling campus
here in Redmond. ``It's not unique to this industry, but is
somewhat indicative of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   In introducing Cohen, Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft,
noted that the Defense Department was Microsoft's largest client
and discussed ways the two could do even more business together in
the future. But Cohen devoted the bulk of his remarks to a
recitation of the military's role in insuring the global stability
that allows companies like Microsoft to prosper.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said: ``We have to be mindful that the prosperity derived
from our vibrant world economy, the stability which allows vigorous
trade, and the economic and intellectual freedom that enables
innovation, would be simply impossible without the persuasiveness
of our ideals, the persistence of our diplomacy, and the power and
actions and the sacrifices of our U.S. military.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, duh, as people of a certain generation Cohen is hoping to
reach might say, but Cohen ``has become personally seized with the
idea,'' the Pentagon's spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, said.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Cohen addressed the Illinois General Assembly in
Springfield, calling for moral and political support for the armed
services. In the weeks ahead, trips are planned to the Arkansas
Legislature, the Kansas City Board of Trade and City Hall in New
Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Hess, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in
Washington, said he would have expected a secretary of state, not
defense, to have to make a public plea for attention, as Madeleine
Albright did to advocate foreign aid when she first became
secretary in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been felt that Defense had its own constituency,''
Hess said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, that is what makes Cohen's campaigns even more unusual.
As an institution, the military remains widely respected. A Harris
poll released just two weeks ago said Americans had more confidence
in the military than in any other American institution, beating out
the Supreme Court, Wall Street and organized religion. What's more,
many cities are deeply shaped by the military's presence _ imagine
San Diego without the Navy _ and the armed services still have
enormous influence in Congress and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cohen said there was a danger that that support had
already begun to wane.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's less of a presence in the daily lives of most
Americans,'' Cohen said in an interview at the Pentagon the other
day. ``And so to the extent that they are not reminded of the role
the military plays day in and day out, there's a danger they will
not be as supportive.''

 REDMOND, Wash.: as supportive.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Cohen, this campaign has a practical side, too. President
Clinton, under pressure from the Pentagon, has proposed more than
$100 billion in new defense spending over the next six years. And
while Republicans in Congress are inclined to spend even more,
there are some lawmakers who question why there needs to be any
increase.
</P>
<P>
   It is not at all clear what effect Cohen's campaign has had or
will ever have. After his address to the Illinois Legislature, in
which he appealed for support for those serving ``from the frozen
hills of Korea and Bosnia to the flight line at Scott Air Force
Base'' near Belleville, Ill., Cohen was surrounded by lawmakers
wanting to know whether his visit somehow meant the Pentagon
intended to close Scott.
</P>
<P>
   Others say Cohen's campaign is not enough. ``Talking to the
chamber of commerce here and there is not going to help the
problem,'' said John Hillen, a former Army captain and now senior
fellow at the Center for Strategic Studies in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Hillen said the services needed to do more to recruit society's
elite, perhaps by offering shorter stints or offering military
scholarships beyond those given to the service academies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd think the bigger problem is down the road,'' he said,
``when we have an entire corps of leaders, whether in business or
politics or academia, who don't have a clue what the military is
all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's remarks Thursday seemed well received. Sarah Wustner,
23, a Microsoft programmer, said she agreed that the military had
``a lot less of a presence'' in the lives of people like her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Navy kept sending me letters when I was in school,
offering scholarships,'' Ms. Wustner said. ``But I thought why
would I want to give up my life when I could be creating new
technology.''

AT A GENOCIDE TRIAL, FRENCH IS A HANDICAP

  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARUSHA, Tanzania _ The only man ever convicted of genocide, a
portly former Rwandan mayor, Jean Paul Akayesu, refused his prison
meals for nine days last fall to protest an obscure ruling no one
here seemed to be aware of: The Rwanda genocide tribunal has too
many Canadian defense lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Akayesu, seeking to avoid his unflattering place in history,
wanted to appeal the genocide verdict handed down against him last
fall by hiring John Philipot, a criminal lawyer from Montreal who,
like him, speaks French.
</P>
<P>
   But his request was swiftly quashed by administrators at the
U.N. tribunal here that is trying suspects in the 1994 killing of
over half a million Rwandans.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all the detainees decided to choose lawyers from one
nationality, we would pack this tribunal with members of one
nationality,'' Kingsley Moghalu, a spokesman for the court, said.
</P>
<P>
   Nine Canadians are enough on a team of 38 defense lawyers, the
top court administrator, Agwu Okali, decided. In addition to
banning any more Canadians from the court, including Philipot, he
limited the number of lawyers from France to nine.
</P>
<P>
   Four months later, Akayesu still does not have the lawyer of his
choice.
</P>
<P>
   The ban has baffled some legal scholars, who contend that the
policy is not only arbitrary but could jeopardize the credibility
of the U.N. tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of a formal geographical representation is absurd,''
said Peter Rosenblum, a specialist on international law at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   He said he suspects the reason for the policy may be an effort
to hire more African lawyers on the court. While that goal is
laudable, he said, the right to chose a lawyer should outweigh the
tribunal's internal politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you really want to get good African lawyers in there, it
can be done without using the sledgehammer,'' he said. ``If you
can't do that, simply banning other lawyers is particularly
egregious.''
</P>
<P>
   Canadian lawyers already defending suspects in the tribunal have
strongly protested the ban.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defense lawyers do not have rights, but persons accused and
presumed innocent most certainly do,'' they wrote to the court
administrator during Akayesu's hunger strike.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers pointed out that geography plays no role in the
selection of defense lawyers at The Hague, Netherlands, where the
Rwanda court's sister tribunal deals with war crimes in the former
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Although Akayesu's protest raised awareness about a policy that
most court staff never knew existed, the strike did not bring him
any closer to getting the lawyer of his choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't yet got his lawyer,'' said Wilfred Mirambo, a
Tanzanian lawyer appointed to represent Akayesu. Mirambo
understands why Akayesu is waiting for another lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He likes French-speaking lawyers, you see,'' said Mirambo, who
does not speak French. ``And somebody should be given his choice.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The retired chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
who led a State Department investigation of bombings of two U.S.
embassies in Africa last summer said on Thursday that the
department is so frightened of seeking money from Congress that
other embassies could be left vulnerable to terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman, Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., who is also a former
ambassador to London, said the embassy security budget that the
State Department requested this month was clearly inadequate and
would leave American diplomats abroad vulnerable. The
administration, he said, may be asking for only enough to ``get the
pressure off their back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The State Department is certainly intimidated by the
Congress,'' Crowe said, noting that the department had asked for $3
billion over five years, much less than half the amount that two
expert panels recommended. ``I think there are going to be more
attacks, and we are going to lose more lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed budget, he suggested, would not allow the
replacement of several embassies that are vulnerable to terrorism.
Crowe noted that the State Department had committed itself to
rebuilding the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, the two destroyed
in the bombings, which killed more than 220 people. ``It seems like
the best way to get a new embassy built is to have yours blown
away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The blunt criticisms, in an interview and in a statement after
the interview, apparently reflect the admiral's anger at the State
Department for having failed to act on key recommendations of the
report he prepared at the department's request on the bombings in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Senior department officials rejected much of the criticism,
insisting that this month's budget requests would result in a
significant improvement of security and that more money would be
requested shortly.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen J. Charles, the deputy assistant secretary of state for
budget and planning, said in an interview that the $3 billion would
allow for building 50 to 60 embassies and other diplomatic
missions, mostly replacements for existing structures. ``The
Congress has been extraordinarily supportive of our requests,'' she
said, noting that Congress approved a separate $1.4 billion for
diplomatic security in an emergency bill last October. ``They are
anxious to work with us on this. But we all have to work within
budgetary constraints.''
</P>
<P>
   In its request, the State Department said it would seek $3
billion over five years to fortify and rebuild diplomatic missions
abroad, for an average of $600 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   In their final report last month, the two panels led by Crowe _
one studied the bombing in Kenya, the other the Tanzania case _
recommended a much larger budget: $14 billion over the next decade,
or about $1.4 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Crowe said the requests made by the State Department ``suggest a
timid approach to the problem _ deja vu.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My instincts, he added, ``are that they might try to do what
they always do. They do just enough to get the pressure off their
backs and not commit so much that they've got a real financial
problem. I don't like the budget figures I've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that failing to push for more money could cost lives.
``We're talking money vs. lives here,'' he said. ``The idea that we
cannot outspend the terrorists or defeat them runs counter to our
history and spirit. ''
</P>
<P>
   Crowe was careful to make clear that his remarks were not meant
as criticism of Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was ``imperative that Secretary Albright is
personally involved'' in the campaign to improve security. ``And I
think that is happening,'' he said. ``She's saying the right
things. I believe she is sincere.''
</P>
<P>
   But as a former military commander and ambassador, Crowe said,
he has seen how both the Pentagon and the State Department handle
their employees. ``The military,'' he said, ``takes better care of
its people. The entire State Department has got to begin taking
responsibility for security, and each individual has to do things
to improve his own personal security. They've got to start taking
it seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   He was harshly critical of Congress, where the Republican
leadership has repeatedly tried to cut the State Department's
overall budget, and the Office of Management and Budget, which
monitors the department's budget for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your instincts would tell you that saving lives would strike a
sympathetic nerve in the Congress, but that's not always true,'' he
said. ``I'm afraid that Congress will once again put money in front
of lives on their priority list. The threat is greater than it has
ever been, and token sums of money will suggest that they do not
give the threats much credit.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the Office of Management and Budget ``has a history
of slashing back State'' and that the ``overall blame'' for
inadequate security at embassies ``should be collectively shared by
Congress, State and the OMB.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the House International Relations Committee,
Lester E. Munson, rejected the criticism of Capitol Hill, noting
that in 1997 and 1998 Congress provided the State Department a
total of $47 million more for diplomatic security beyond the budget
requested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress has over the long term been very committed to working
with the administration on diplomatic security issues,'' Munson
said. ``The problem comes in trying to politicize this issue, and
we're very much trying to resist that.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Ricci, a spokeswoman for the Office of Management and
Budget, said that the State Department's budget requests to
Congress ``included the most sustained long-term commitment for
embassy security ever.''

NATIVE SON SAYS HE'S RUNNING, AND FEW ARE HAPPY ABOUT IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WOLFEBORO, N.H. _ Casting himself as a bedrock conservative
determined to ``keep America strong and free for millions yet
unborn,'' Sen. Robert Smith returned Thursday to the high school
where he taught history three decades ago and stepped forward as
the first candidate to make a formal announcement of his campaign
for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But the candidacy of Smith, New Hampshire's senior senator, was
not widely welcomed by Republican leaders in the state. Although
his campaign gets under way with just the barest of public support,
they fear that if he begins running unexpectedly well here, other
contenders will be inclined to concede him a home-state advantage
in New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary, do little stumping
here and so make the primary all but irrelevant to a nomination
that, they believe, he is unlikely to win.
</P>
<P>
   Smith acknowledged that his national ambitions had been
ridiculed by Republicans in his own state. But he predicted that he
would emerge from the pack, because, he said, he is the most
genuine, unabashed conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a leap-year conservative jumping out of the grass
every four years to say, `Here I am, I want to be president,'''
Smith declared to a cheering audience at Kingswood Regional High
School in this summer resort town in central New Hampshire. ``I've
been fighting day after day for the past 15 years in the United
States House and the Senate for the conservative values I believe
best represent New Hampshire. I might be a new face in this
presidential campaign, but I'm an old warrior.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith invoked God and the Bible, and spoke most passionately of
three unswerving stands that have marked his tenure in Congress:
his support for a national anti-missile defense, his demand for a
full accounting of Americans missing in Vietnam (the senator, who
served with the Navy in Vietnam, heaped praise in his speech on
Eugene McDaniel, a former prisoner of war there who introduced him)
and his opposition to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life's goal is to protect all unborn children,'' Smith
asserted, drawing applause from an audience in which students far
outnumbered his adult supporters. ``As president, I will nominate
only pro-life justices to the Supreme Court.''
</P>
<P>
   Likening his intentions to Lincoln's freeing of the slaves, he
said, ``Abortion is the moral outrage of the 20th century, and I
will end it.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator dismissed Republicans who say the party should drop
President Clinton's impeachment as an issue, He condemned the
president for ``criminal behavior,'' offered himself as an official
of upstanding character and later said he viewed Clinton's ``in
your face'' visit to this state Thursday, less than a week after
his acquittal by the Senate, as inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans perplexed by Smith's designs on the White House, and
their implications for the state's primary, recall that when, for
example, Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa sought the Democratic presidential
nomination in 1992, most other democratic contenders stayed away
from the Iowa caucuses, which as a result carried little weight
that year.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, Smith's quest has done little to discourage
prospective Republican opponents, perhaps because he barely
registers single digits in New Hampshire polls, in which he is
overwhelmed by George W. Bush and Elizabeth Dole. Smith referred to
both, and to Steve Forbes, only obliquely Thursday, saying, ``I
don't have a big name or a huge family trust fund.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith performed so weakly in winning re-election to the Senate
two years ago that network exit polls at one point declared him the
loser to his democratic opponent, former Rep. Dick Swett. Smith
ultimately won, with only 49 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Now his presidential candidacy carries substantial risks to his
support at home. A humiliating showing in his own state would leave
him particularly vulnerable should he seek re-election to the
Senate in 2002: He could suffer a humiliating showing. Already, he
has irked some constituents who thinks he should be tending to the
state's business rather than seeking higher office.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Carney, a veteran Republican strategist in New Hampshire,
``noted that since 1960, every statewide elected official around
the country who had run for president, lost and then ran for
re-election to the lower post has done worse.''
</P>
<P>
   In seeking a presidential nomination, Carney noted, candidates
have to move further to the left or right and thus lose some of the
broader appeal that helped them get elected back home.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in an interview Thursday before his announcement why early
polls showed him badly lagging, Smith said: ``It's because I've
never run for president in my own state. What it says is I have not
run for president. These candidates are in here all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   But both Bush and Mrs. Dole ahver barely set foot in the state's
snow-covered hamlets. And Smith could not explain why he was
scoring so low in plls here, when native sons customarily score
high.
</P>
<P>
   Although he plans a low-budget campaign, Smith has traveled the
country extensively in the last year (he tallies 42 days in Iowa).
He disputes speculation that he is running simply to advance his
views or to position himself for a cabinet job in a Republican
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be in this race if I wasn't intending to win New
Hampshire and Iowa and North Dakota,'' he said. ``There's no other
reason to get into this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   To drive home that point in his speech, he cited not only Ronald
Reagan but Jesse Ventura, the former professional wrestler who was
elected governor of Minnesota last year as an independent. ``The
pollsters and the pundits and the experts said that a vote for
Jesse Ventura was a wasted vote,'' said Smith, who, like Ventura,
is a plain-speaking, burly man who towers over people. ``He's now
the governor of Minnesota.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who set off what will be a succession of official
candidate announcement tours in the next few months, will take his
fledgling tour to Iowa on Friday, seeking more attention in the
state that usually holds the first presidential caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   While his speech dwelled on social issues, Smith also called for
an across-the-board 10 percent tax cut for all Americans, curbing
the federal government's involvement in education and supporting
the rights of gun owners. Presenting himself as a populist with
grassroots appeal, Smith said, ``You've heard of the country club
Republicans. Well, I'm a country music Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   The sentiment that Smith may be trying to do the impossible came
across even in his rally. The trappings were there: the admiring
wife and children. The school band (playing ``Rocky'' at the
beginning and ``God Bless America'' at the end.) The American
Legion color guard.
</P>
<P>
   But in introducing Smith, Phil Decelle, who hired him to teach
and coach baseball here a quarter-century ago, mentioned the
naysayers. ``Maybe familiarity breeds a little bit of contempt,''
he said. ``Maybe, because he is so close to us, we can't see Smith
as president. I'd like to say I can see Smith as president.''

 &HT;    Another driver for Junie
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sunday's North Carolina 400 at Rockingham is the
second date on the Winston Cup circuit, but longtime owner Junie
Donlavey already has hired his third driver.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Shepherd, entering his 23rd season, will drive Donlavey's
No. 90 Ford. Cup rookie Mike Harmon started Speedweeks in that car
but was replaced by Mike Wallace after a pending sponsor fell
through.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, who will return to the Craftsman Truck Series, finished
a surprising 23rd in the Daytona 500, collecting $111,806 for
Donlavey. Harmon, a short-track specialist from Alabama, was
holding out hope that he'd return to the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Morgan was without a ride for this race,'' Donlavey
said. ``I just didn't think (Harmon) would have worked out with us.
Rather than having any hard feelings, we just felt it was better to
settle it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Donlavey, who said his team still doesn't have a primary sponsor
but will run until at least through the March 14 race in Atlanta,
says Harmon might try to drive the No. 81 Ford of owner Filbert
Martocci, who had Shepherd behind the wheel in Daytona 500
qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   Also, owner Larry Hedrick has changed crew chiefs for his No. 41
Chevrolet, driven by David Green. Team manager Mike Hill is
replacing Tim Brewer, who will serve as a consultant. Green missed
the Daytona 500 after wrecking in the twin 125-mile qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
   PAYIN' FOR CHEATIN'
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR levied the following fines for illegal parts at the
Daytona 500: Newt Moore, crew chief for Robert Pressley, $5,000 for
unapproved brake rotors; Greg Conner, crew chief for Mike Wallace,
$3,000 for a non-magnetic drive shaft; and Joe Garone, crew chief
for Bill Elliott, and Wayne Orme, crew chief for Dick Trickle,
$2,000 each for unapproved exhaust pipes.
</P>
<P>
   HELP ON THE WAY
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup rookie Buckshot Jones of Tucker, who failed to make
the field for last week's Daytona 500, is negotiating a consulting
deal with Hendrick Motorsports.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, the most popular driver on NASCAR's Busch Series last
season, posted some of the slowest qualifying and testing times
last week at Daytona International Speedway. Jones already gets his
engines from Hendrick and now his team is seeking help with
suspension from NASCAR's reigning juggernaut.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we were a little better prepared than what were for
Winston Cup racing,'' said Billy Jones, the driver's father and
owner of Buckshot Racing. ``We've got to get some help in
aerodynamics and springs and shocks. . . . We're evaluating our
capabilities in-house, as well. We're going to hire some more
people. Our guys got a rude awakening to the fact that we've got a
lot to learn.''

   BUSCH NATIONAL
</P>
<P>
   MAKING THE JUMP
</P>
<P>
   Grand National driver Matt Kenseth, the defending champion in
this week's Alltel 200, has come a long way since he started
driving on Wisconsin's short tracks at the age of 16.
</P>
<P>
   Kenseth, 26, had the most top-fives and top-10s in the Busch
Series last year and finished only 48 points behind close friend
Dale Earnhardt Jr. in the point standings.
</P>
<P>
   Last year at ``The Rock,'' Kenseth won after starting 27th, the
biggest jump on the Busch circuit since Mark Martin leaped from
17th to first in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The Kenseth team plans on jumping to the Winston Cup circuit
next season. ``We'd like to go to Winston Cup and keep this team
together,'' crew chief Robbie Reiser said.
</P>
<P>
   NEW DRIVER
</P>
<P>
   Mike Swaim Jr., a regular in the Goody's Dash Series, will
replace Andy Santerre in the No. 47 Chevrolet. Santerre, who
finished 20th in last year's standings with one pole and three
top-10s, broke the patella and fibula in his right leg in a crash
at Daytona last week. He is probably out until at least June.

<P>
   Calling into question the federal government's boast that the
U.S. food supply is the safest in the world, a consumer group said
Thursday that in a majority of cases, domestic produce had more, or
more toxic, pesticide residues than imported produce.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis by Consumer Reports of the amounts of pesticides on
produce and their toxicity is bad news about some of the fruits and
vegetables that children love best.
</P>
<P>
   This information is not meant to frighten people into eating
fewer fruits and vegetables, said Edward Groth, director of
technical policy and public service for Consumers Union, which
publishes Consumer Reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about fear of food,'' Groth said. ``It's about giving
people information to make smart choices'' to reduce the amount of
pesticides they and their children ingest.
</P>
<P>
   John McClung, vice president for issues of the United Fresh
Fruit and Vegetable Association, a trade group, said the produce
industry complied with the law. ``We are disappointed that they
have chosen to continue to insist there is peril in fruits and
vegetables,'' he said. ``The risks are remote and hypothetical.''
</P>
<P>
   The group's analysis of 27 foods cited seven fruits and
vegetables _ apples, grapes, green beans, peaches, pears, spinach
and winter squash _ as having toxicity at hundreds of times the
levels of other foods analyzed. Foods with the lowest toxicity were
apple juice, bananas, broccoli, canned peaches, milk, orange juice
and canned or frozen peas and corn.
</P>
<P>
   Children are at greater risk from pesticide residues because
they eat far more produce per pound of body weight than adults eat
and because children are more sensitive to effects of pesticides.
Some pesticides are suspected of causing cancer, some are toxic to
the nervous system and some may interfere with hormones.
</P>
<P>
   To determine the relative toxicity of the produce, Consumer
Reports created a toxicity index based on the frequency of
pesticide detection, levels of residues and relative toxicity of
residues. Using Department of Agriculture statistics based on
27,000 food samples from 1994 to 1997, the magazine looked at foods
children are most likely to eat.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the foods tested for pesticide residues were within
legal limits, but were frequently well above the levels the
Environmental Protection Agency says are safe for young children.
According to the Consumers Union report, even one serving of some
fruits and vegetables can exceed safe daily limits for young
children. The example used for a young child was a 5-year-old
weighing an average of 44 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic fresh peaches had the highest toxicity level, far above
peaches imported from Chile. Canned domestic peaches had very, very
low toxicity. Frozen domestic winter squash had a much higher
toxicity level than fresh domestic winter squash, but fresh and
frozen imported winter squash had very low levels of toxicity.
</P>
<P>
   Groth said it was ``shocking'' that foreign produce had lower
levels of toxicity than domestic. He suggested the reason might be,
in part, that foreign growers used fewer pesticides because of the
additional costs. Processed fruits and vegetables often have lower
levels of pesticide residues than fresh because they are peeled and
because they do not have to be cosmetically perfect. In addition,
many canners have contracts with growers that specify what
pesticides can be used.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency is required by the 1996 Food
Quality Protection Act to re-examine the effects on children of
widely used pesticides. The agency has already lowered estimates
for safe daily limits for ingestion of 19 of about 40
organophosphate pesticides, including methyl parathion, but it has
not yet lowered the residue limits on foods.
</P>
<P>
   Methyl parathion accounts for most of the total toxicity on the
foods that were analyzed, particularly peaches, frozen and canned
green beans, pears and apples. Late last year, the agency said the
methyl parathion posed an ``unacceptable risk'' but that it had not
taken any action to ban it or reduce its use. Organophosphates are
neurological poisons and work the same on humans as they do on
insects.
</P>
<P>
   Dieldrin, banned since 1974, continues as a significant risk
because it remains in the soil. Unlike methyl parathion, dieldrin
is absorbed into the pulp of root vegetables as well as squashes,
melons and cucumbers. The only way to avoid it is to plant crops in
uncontaminated soil.
</P>
<P>
   Aldicarb is the most acutely toxic of all pesticides currently
in use. Like dieldrin, aldicarb cannot be washed or trimmed off.
</P>
<P>
   Groth said there were at least 15 viable chemical or nonchemical
alternatives for each hazardous pesticide. Consumers Union has
asked the federal agency to act faster to reduce children's
exposure, urging it to concentrate immediately on the few
pesticides that contribute disproportionately to the toxicity of
residues in the food supply.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the agency said it was ``in the process of
implementing the Food Quality Protection Act.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to choosing foods with lower levels of toxicity,
pesticide exposure can be reduced by peeling produce and by buying
organically grown fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are plenty of ways parents can get healthy foods into
kids without exposing them to high-risk stuff,'' Nancy Metcalf of
Consumer Reports said

 &HT;    Facing hitters after six months, Wohlers remains off-target
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ Mark Wohlers opened the
pitchers-and-catchers spring training workouts Thursday by facing
hitters for the first time in six months. The results weren't
exactly pretty.
</P>
<P>
   He hit batter Mike Mahoney twice. Very few of his pitches were
even offered at because he wasn't close to the target, catcher
Pascual Matos. Minor-league outfielder George Lombard kept his bat
on his shoulder until the very last pitch he saw. But Wohlers still
was glad to get his first taste of throwing to hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big first step to go out there, regardless of the
results,'' Wohlers said.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Cox agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went out there and got through the first day _ that was a
step,'' Cox said. ``We had some hitters stay in there and hit
against him. I respect them for that. It's hard to do.''
</P>
<P>
   BAYLOR GETS START
</P>
<P>
   New hitting coach Don Baylor began his work of trying to improve
a Braves offense that set franchise records for home runs in a
season (215) and runs scored (826).
</P>
<P>
   Baylor says he sees plenty of room for improvement, though, and
it starts in the strikeout column. The Braves have had more than
1,000 strikeouts each of the last three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be able to alleviate a lot of those,'' Baylor said.
``Even if you put the ball in play, you can move a guy over. If you
strike out, nothing happens.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his most important assignments just got even more
important _ working with Ryan Klesko. Now that Andres Galarraga is
lost for the season to lymphoma, Klesko needs to make some big
strides offensively.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor sees the potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when Klesko first came to the big leagues he was a
left-center guy,'' said Baylor, referring to Klesko's ability to
use the opposite field. ``Everybody started talking home runs _
(the Braves) had 25 straight games with home runs (in May to tie a
major-league record). You forget about other things you have to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   He shrugged off the task he has in building on what the Braves
offense did during the regular season last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what our business is all about, not resting on what you
did last year, always wanting to take it to the next step.''
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for this spring, Baylor said he went through his
notes and charts on the Braves hitters from his six years as
manager of the Colorado Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I get to use them as a positive,'' Baylor said.
</P>
<P>
   ROLL CALL
</P>
<P>
   Only three pitchers and catchers from the 40-man roster were
absent Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Minor-league catcher Fernando Lunar was having a sore
non-throwing shoulder examined. Reliever Russ Springer is still
recovering from back surgery at home in Pollock, La., and isn't
expected to arrive before mid-March. Pitcher Adrian Manzano won't
arrive from Mexico until next week because of visa problems.

 &HT;    Teammates shocked: 'Everybody loves him'
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ The Atlanta Braves were jolted Thursday
by the news that Andres Galarraga has been diagnosed with lymphoma
of a bone in his back.
</P>
<P>
   Players and staff preparing for spring training, which began
Thursday with workouts for pitchers and catchers, had to
contemplate an entire 1999 season without Galarraga, a cornerstone
of the Braves offense and a well-respected leader in the clubhouse
after only a year in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it's a sad day for us from a personal standpoint
because he's such a wonderful human being,'' Braves general manager
John Schuerholz said of the first baseman. ``We're going to miss
him as much from that standpoint as we're going to miss him as a
member of our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuerholz and Braves manager Bobby Cox were told on Tuesday
that Galarraga had a cancerous abnormality and was undergoing
tests. Both were relieved to learn Thursday that the lymphoma had
been isolated in one bone in his lower back and appears to be
treatable.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal gut reaction was I was relieved, because who knows
what this insidious and horrible disease can do to you?''
Schuerholz said. ``The best two words I'm going to speak in this
whole announcement are the last two words Dr. (Lee) Kelley spoke to
me and said they are 'very optimistic.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga will undergo chemotherapy treatment in West Palm
Beach, where the Venezuelan lives in the offseason. Cox said the
Braves will visit him during spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always got a great outlook on life, period,'' Cox said.
``Andres is in such great shape, I think that's going to be a
factor for him, too. I feel better about it now (knowing the cancer
is contained), and hopefully Andres will, too. He was down when I
talked to him this morning (before the final test).''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Klesko, who will move from left field to first to take over
for Galarraga, hoped for the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, man,'' Klesko said. ``He's not just a teammate; he's a
friend. He's a great guy. Everybody loves him. Always got a smile
on his face. I guarantee throughout this whole thing, he'll have a
smile on his face. Our prayers will be with him. I'm in shock. I've
never had anything like this happen to any of my teammates. I don't
even know what I'm feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Otis Nixon, the veteran outfielder reacquired by the Braves in
the offseason, will move into left field. But when he heard the
news, he was not thinking about baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow,'' Nixon said. ``Man. I'm just shocked. I'm not thinking
about playing a position. It's not good news. ... I've got to take
a deep breath. Not good news.

 &HT;    Comeback by Klesko now vital
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ The Braves' offseason acquisitions of
Brian Jordan, Bret Boone and Otis Nixon were looking large on
Thursday afternoon, when it was announced that first baseman Andres
Galarraga has cancer and will not play this season.
</P>
<P>
   So was the move that wasn't made.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of trading Ryan Klesko and his $20.5 million contract,
the Braves kept him, hoping that new hitting coach Don Baylor could
rejuvenate his offensive production.
</P>
<P>
   Without Galarraga, the Braves now need Klesko to play first
base, where he played in the minor leagues. Nixon will start in
left.
</P>
<P>
   General manager John Schuerholz said he doesn't plan to search
for another every-day first baseman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very satisfied with the fact that Ryan's here and can do
the job,'' Schuerholz said. ``Ryan Klesko proved years ago what
kind of offensive player he is. He showed when he was a young guy,
up through the minor leagues, he was a pretty good first baseman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may continue to look about how we protect ourselves for
depth at that position. ... But we don't feel like we need to fill
a gaping void.''
</P>
<P>
   Klesko had career lows last season in home runs (18) and RBIs
(70). He had a career-high 29 doubles. His defense won't compare
with that of Galarraga, who won two Gold Gloves, but it's enough
for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like he's going to be a project to slip in at first
base,'' manager Bobby Cox said. ``I was going to play Ryan at first
base once in a while anyway, just to get Otis into the lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   Klesko seldom has been used at first base during his
major-league career, but he said Thursday he is comfortable with
the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played that position my whole career,'' Klesko said.
``For me, I'm more worried about (Galarraga's health). ... It'll be
hard to fill his shoes offensively, but I'll give it a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga hit .305 in the cleanup spot last season and led the
Braves in home runs (44) and RBIs (121).
</P>
<P>
   ``One player is not drastically going to change (our offense),''
Klesko said. ``But we're definitely going to miss him. Galarraga
was one of the main guys. He did so much for us.

 &HT;    Yankees make `sacrifices' for Clemens
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The watched pot finally boiled Thursday. Roger Clemens
bolted Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees, strangely eager to alter a roster that won
125 games and a World Series last season, acquired the five-time Cy
Young Award winner nearly three months after Clemens determined he
wanted to leave and the Blue Jays opened the market.
</P>
<P>
   The price wasn't cheap. Toronto receives left-hander David
Wells, originally drafted by the Jays in 1982; left-handed reliever
Graeme Lloyd, who did not yield a run in 24 Yankee Stadium
appearances last year; and infielder Homer Bush, who hit .380 in 45
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm shocked,'' Lloyd said. ``To break up the team, it's a
shame.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees had to move decisively, as calls to Toronto
began to pick up in the past week before spring training begins in
full. The Houston Astros and, to a lesser degree, the Texas Rangers
remained in the running.
</P>
<P>
   ``What drove this deal,'' Blue Jays general manager Gord Ash
said, ``was trying to make the best possible deal for our club. We
knew we weren't going to get the necessary return from other
places.''
</P>
<P>
   Hence, the long duration. The Anaheim Angels offered outfield
Jim Edmonds, third baseman Dave Hollins and pitcher Jason Dickson
and couldn't get in the door. Talks with the Cleveland Indians
never went past the preliminary stage, with Tribe GM John Hart
convinced Clemens would wind up in his native Texas with the
Astros.
</P>
<P>
   But while Astros owner Drayton McClane set a Monday deadline to
settle the issue, he would not part with pitcher Scott Elarton and
outfielder Richard Hidalgo, young players who had been Ash's
personal choices. The Yankees moved quickly within the last 24
hours, offering quality pitching and a quality prospect.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a chance to add one of the greatest pitchers in
the game to your staff, you have to make sacrifices,'' Yankees GM
Brian Cashman said.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Boston wondered if Clemens was starting to fade
and let him go. But the Rocket was 41-13 with six shutouts in his
two Canadian seasons.
</P>
<P>
   However, finances remain to be settled. Although he has two
years at $11 million remaining on his contract, Clemens' agent,
Alan Hendricks, had sought an extension at $15 million per year _
Kevin Brown's new wage in Los Angeles _ when a deal with Houston
broke down in December.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees now offer a rotation of Clemens, David Cone, Orlando
Hernandez, Andy Pettitte and Hideki Irabu _ a combined 81-37 last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the rest of the Yankees saw the move coming.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to his clubhouse, manager Joe Torre said, ``There's
some shock in that room right now.''

 &HT;    Success makes Falcons' cap tight fit
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Falcons toiled for 33 years before
reaching their first Super Bowl. Now, they're paying the price.
</P>
<P>
   Literally.
</P>
<P>
   When linebacker Cornelius Bennett was cut Wednesday, it was
mainly because the team had almost no room left under the 1999 NFL
salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   That's partly because they had so much success last season.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons players accrued about $2.2 million in performance
incentives last season, and the way cap figures are calculated, the
net effect on the 1999 salary cap is greater than that.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Jamal Anderson, for example, was to have counted
$1.65 million against next season's salary cap. But while rushing
for a franchise-record 1,846 yards, he earned $950,000 in
yardage-related bonuses, another $25,000 for making the Pro Bowl
and another $30,000 for being named All-Pro.
</P>
<P>
   All $1,005,000 of that will be paid this year, in addition to
his '99 salary. But that's not the only effect on the cap.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Anderson has earned the incentives, they are
reclassified from ``Not Likely To Be Earned'' by the NFL to
``Likely To Be Earned'' (LTBE), and they also count in advance
against the '99 cap.
</P>
<P>
   That means Anderson will count $3.66 million instead of $1.65
million against next season's cap.
</P>
<P>
   Kicker Morten Andersen, meanwhile, earned a $300,000 bonus for
making the game-winning kick in the NFC Championship Game. So
instead of counting $880,000 against next year's cap, he'll count
$1.48 million.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the team about $3.1 million under the cap took the
release of Bennett and his $2.45 million in '99 salary and
anticipated workout bonus, center/guard Dave Widell and his
$500,000 salary and running back Harold Green and his $825,000 in
salary and anticipated bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Falcons face the prospect of having to fill 27 spots on
the 80-player roster by training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means you're being successful,'' said coach Dan Reeves, who
explained that another reason for Bennett's release is that '98
first-round draft choice Keith Brooking plays the same position.
``Those are things that just started coming into contracts since
the salary cap (was created in 1994). It's just totally different
now.''
</P>
<P>
   In the offseason, each team's cap total is calculated by using
the cap figures _ salary plus pro-rated signing bonus plus LTBEs _
of the 51 highest-paid players.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' $3.1 million or so is just about enough to re-sign
five of their nine remaining unrestricted free agents _ strong
safety William White, cornerback Ronnie Bradford, defensive end
Antonio Edwards, wide receiver Ronnie Harris and deep snapper Adam
Schreiber.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine, as long as the team frees up money later, before
signing rookies who would carry top-51 cap numbers.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Harold Richardson said the same theory applies
if the Falcons decide to sign free agents from other teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not in the business of seeing how much cap room I can
create just to create it,'' Richardson said. ``In general
philosophy, (free agency) deals done in the first two weeks are top
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams are giving free agents a premium price, an extra reason,
to get off the market fast. It's a fluid situation. If a player
comes available, he upgrades our team, and he's at a (salary)
number that's mutually beneficial, we'll create cap room and try to
go get him.''
</P>
<P>
   That can be done by cutting players or by restructuring
contracts of high-salaried players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the releasing has likely been done,'' Richardson said.
``More likely, it will be restructuring from now on, but it depends
on who comes available (when teams release more players).''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson and Reeves are intrigued by recently released strong
safety Steve Atwater, whom Reeves drafted in Denver in 1989, and
Giants wide receiver Chris Calloway, who played for Reeves 1993-96
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   When Richardson massaged the salary cap for the Broncos from
1993-96, restructuring quarterback John Elway's contract was almost
an annual event, in order to create cap room to sign one big-name
free agent.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, that luxury is not so readily available.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Chris Chandler's $4.7 million cap figure will be the
team's highest, but a player's deal can be reworked only once a
year. His was redone the first week of September last year.
</P>
<P>
   Middle linebacker Jessie Tuggle, with a $3.85 million cap
figure, and Anderson have the second- and third-highest cap figures
on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta wants to extend Anderson, 26, but he's become a five- or
six-year, $30 million-$40 million player and could try free agency
after 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Tuggle will be 34 next season and in the final year of his
contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons could take his salary of roughly $3 million for next
season, put it in a lump sum as a signing bonus for a three-year
contract and pay him a league-minimum salary of $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   Counting his $1 million pro-rated signing bonus, the $883,300
that remains from his old signing bonus, plus the $400,000 salary,
he would count $2,283,300 against the 1999 cap _ a savings of
$1,566,700.
</P>
<P>
   But in 2000, the five-time Pro Bowler would command a salary
greater than the nearly $3 million he was to have earned in '99,
and suddenly a 35-year-old linebacker would eat up about $4 million
worth of cap money.
</P>
<P>
   Tuggle is not about to take a pay cut, and releasing the Griffin
native, a 12-year veteran, would be a public-relations nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``My door would definitely be open,'' said Tuggle, who no longer
plays in passing situations. ``I'm still playing at a Pro Bowl
level. As long as I'm compensated at a Pro Bowl level, it doesn't
matter if it's now or later.''

 &HT;    Disease generally treatable when diagnosed early
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Doctors are optimistic that Andres Galarraga will
recover fully from his cancer, especially because it has not spread
to his other organs.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves first baseman has non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of his third
lumbar vertebra, a bone in the lower part of his spine, said Dr.
Lee Kelley, Galarraga's orthopedic surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma can be fatal _ Jordan's King Hussein,
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Sen. Paul Tsongas are among those
who have died from the disease _ but it is generally treatable when
caught early. Galarraga, 37, first reported back pain in November;
last week magnetic resonance imaging revealed lymphoma, which was
confirmed Wednesday by a biopsy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, lymphomas respond,'' said Dr. Kenneth Smith, a
hematology oncologist at Emory University Hospital. ``The long-term
results depend on the specific type of lymphoma, the age of the
patient, and whether it's localized. (Galarraga's) young age would
be favorable.''
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga will undergo five months of chemotherapy, then a month
of radiation treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Lymphoma, cancer of the lymphatic system, encompasses several
conditions in which lymphocytes, which circulate in the blood and
make up 20 percent of the cells in bone marrow, grow abnormally and
destroy tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Hodgkin's disease, characterized by a particular type of
cancerous cell, affects about 7,100 new people per year.
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is far more common, with about 55,400 new
diagnoses in 1998, according to the American Cancer Society (ACS).
Most people with non-Hodgkin's have no known risk factors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like being struck with lightning, a random event,'' Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
   Survival rates vary widely, depending on how advanced the
disease is. The one-year survival rate for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
is 71 percent; the disease kills about 26,300 per year, according
to ACS figures.
</P>
<P>
   The first symptoms of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma usually are
enlarged lymph nodes in the neck or groin. Fever, itching, night
sweats, anemia and weight loss also occur.
</P>
<P>
   Yet these symptoms might not show up if the lymphoma is confined
to the bone, as in Galarraga's case. His recurrent back pain at
first was mistaken for muscle damage.
</P>
<P>
   The cancerous cells can destroy the cortex, the hard part of the
bone, but Kelley said he thinks the bone will repair itself after
the cancer is eliminated.

<P>
   MIAMI _ The world's largest cruise company, Carnival Corp.,
earned $2 billion in profits over the last three years. But the
company, with headquarters here in two multistory buildings on
Carnival Place, paid less than 1 percent in income taxes even
though its earnings exceeded those of many Fortune 500 companies.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Caribbean Cruises, the second-largest cruise company,
whose headquarters overlook the port of Miami, reported profits of
$657 million over the same time. Its financial statements do not
even include a line for income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Doing business under a decades-old loophole in the federal tax
code and protected by an increasingly powerful lobbying force, the
17 major cruise lines pay practically no income tax even though
they are are based in this country and 90 percent of their
passengers are Americans. The cruise lines, all of them registered
in foreign countries, do not observe the nation's labor laws,
minimum wage law and many environmental and safety regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Just last fall, by having a senator insert a single word in the
federal budget bill, the 17 cruise concerns won an exemption from
immigration fees worth $20 million a year. In an amendment to
another bill, a congressman protected the cruise lines' monopoly on
coveted permits to sail into Glacier Bay National Park in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade the cruise industry has grown rapidly,
launching ever-bigger ships carrying thousands of passengers. Now
concern is growing over the megaships' impact on marine
environments and the impact of the industry's tax advantages on
struggling American-registered cruise ships.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, a potential battle is brewing on several fronts,
including the the foreign-registered cruise ships' major advantage:
While they earn their profits from the United States, they avoid
nearly all taxes by registering as foreign corporations and sailing
under foreign flags. They also build their giant floating resorts
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``These companies don't pay any of the taxes or live with any of
the associated costs of operating a safe vessel and paying a decent
wage,'' said Rep. Gene Taylor, D-Miss., whose district includes
shipbuilding companies, ``and it is absurd to allow them access to
the American market free of charge.``
</P>
<P>
   Last month Trent Lott, R-Miss., the Senate majority leader,
called on the Clinton administration to work with Congress to
strengthen the U.S. maritime industry by re-examining the
advantages enjoyed by foreign companies. ``This nation's tax
policies should promote business growth, not stifle it,'' Lott
said.
</P>
<P>
   And this month, two Democrats in the House of Representatives,
John Dingell of Michigan and Henry Waxman of California, initiated
an investigation by the Commerce and Government Reform committees
into illegal dumping of oily waste and other pollutants by cruise
ships, to determine whether the United States should strengthen its
regulation of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major companies may argue that they have environmental
programs in place,'' Dingell said, ``but as long as these practices
persist, it calls into question either the quality of the plans or
the commitment of senior management or both.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry representatives respond that cruise lines adhere to
strict international environmental and safety standards that are
enforced by the International Maritime Organization, a regulatory
agency affiliated with the United Nations. And they say immunity
from U.S. taxes is a long-recognized element of international law
on ocean-going trade.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise lines pay more than $66 million a year in fees to
American ports, as well as other taxes and fees, according to the
industry. And a new study done for the industry found cruise lines
bought $6.6 billion worth of U.S. goods and services in 1997,
generating 176,433 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We generate billions of dollars every year here in the U.S.
economy and the United States is a major beneficiary of our
industry,'' said Cynthia A. Colenda, president of the International
Council of Cruise Lines, which represents the 17 major cruise
lines. ``This industry is a revenue generator, and it helps
economies throughout this country.''
</P>
<P>
   While the 17 cruise lines and some of their suppliers have
prospered, however, the U.S. maritime industry has fallen on hard
times. The only cruise ship flying an American flag is the
50-year-old Independence, which travels among the Hawaiian Islands,
and no deep-ocean cruise ship has been built in the United States
for at least 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts are under way to develop an American-flag cruise
industry, but American shipping companies that must pay United
States taxes and wages face serious disadvantages.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. corporate income tax rate is 35 percent, though most
corporations pay a modestly lower rate through various deductions.
</P>
<P>
   If Carnival were a U.S. corporation paying taxes at the 35
percent rate _ or even if it were a foreign corporation in a
different business here _ it would have paid about $700 million in
taxes to the United States over the last three years on $2 billion
in net income.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Carnival is registered in Panama, which does not impose
a business income tax, and the company paid a total of only $15
million in income taxes _ on the earnings of one division, which
has hotels and tour operations in the United States and so is not
exempt from taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The tax break is in a section of the Internal Revenue Code that
exempts foreign corporations' income from ships and aircraft from
taxation, if the country in which the corporation is organized
offers the equivalent exemption to U.S. corporations. The rules
were set up to promote international shipping and air trade.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise companies have been able to take unique advantage of the
provision by registering in small countries like Liberia, Panama
and the Bahamas, which do not impose a corporate income tax. Major
airlines like British Airways or Lufthansa do not pay U.S. taxes
either under the provision, but unlike the cruise lines, they are
not based in the United States, and they pay substantial taxes in
their home countries.
</P>
<P>
   And American-registered cruise companies do not benefit from a
reciprocal exemption because they remain subject to U.S. taxes,
even on their international business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our members are fully subject to U.S. income taxes, even if we
take our vessels into foreign waters,'' said Edmund B. Welch,
legislative director for the Passenger Vessel Association, the
trade group for passenger ships flying under American flags, which
are mostly sightseeing and excursion vessels. ``We have ships
relocate from the Pacific Northwest down to Mexico in the winter,''
he said, ``but they still pay U.S. taxes on their Mexican
operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign-registered cruise lines also pay workers far less than
their U.S. counterparts. Their crew members, who are mainly from
developing countries, routinely work 10 to 12 hours a day, seven
days a week, for as little as $400 a month, according to a survey
last year by Seafarers' House, a nonprofit agency that ministers to
workers at Florida ports.

 MIAMI: Florida ports.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There has never been a serious effort to alter the tax rules,
and the industry has developed an effective lobbying presence in
Washington to protect its interests.
</P>
<P>
   While all the members of the International Council of Cruise
Lines are foreign businesses, campaign finance law allows the
organization to have political action committees and raise
donations from cruise line employees who are U.S. citizens. In the
1997-98 election cycle the group donated $166,146 to House and
Senate candidates, according to the Center for Responsive Politics,
a nonpartisan organization in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The council spent more on lobbying. In its latest full-year
report filed with the Senate, it said it spent $557,023 on lobbying
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the money, $380,000, went to the law firm of Alcalde &AMP;
Fay for work on tax and immigration issues. The firm, which is run
by Hector Alcalde, a former congressional staff member, received an
additional $200,000 in the first half of 1998. Alcalde is the
father of Cynthia Colenda, who worked at his firm before taking
over as president of the International Council of Cruise Lines.
</P>
<P>
   The effectiveness of the lobbying was evident in the budget bill
for the current fiscal year. An innocuous-looking item, Section
114, amended the immigration act by inserting a single word,
``state,'' and a comma. Doing so eliminated as much as $20 million
a year in fees from cruise lines.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service had been authorized
to assess $6 per passenger to cover inspection costs for people
arriving in American ports on cruise ships, unless their cruise had
begun in Canada, Mexico or a U.S. territory. Adding ``state''
expanded the exemption to passengers whose travel started in the
United States _ eliminating the fee for all but the tiny number of
transoceanic passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The immigration service calculated that the change cost it $20
million a year, a spokesman, Greg Gagne, said. ``We were aware that
it was going in, but it certainly wasn't our choice or our
preference,'' he said. ``We think all carriers should share in the
cost equally.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, however, the fee had not been assessed in recent years.
Gagne and industry representatives said they did not know why.
</P>
<P>
   The change originated in the Senate, but records do not identify
its author. Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, chairman of the
Appropriations Committee, said through a spokeswoman that he knew
who wrote the section and that he had approved it, but he refused
to identify the senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Stevens is respecting the confidentiality rules of the
Senate,'' the spokeswoman, Jen Siciliano, said.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor ran into similar secrecy when he tried to close a
loophole that allows the foreign-registered cruise lines to operate
gambling cruises out of American ports.
</P>
<P>
   Under a century-old law intended to protect the American
shipping industry, ships flying foreign flags cannot travel between
American ports or leave from and return to the same American port
unless they visit a foreign port as part of the voyage. That is why
foreign cruise ships sailing from Miami or San Diego stop at a
foreign location before returning, a practice critics call
``cleansing the voyage'' for tax purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The Customs Service, however, ruled that foreign vessels meet
the requirement in some cases if they merely sail three miles out
into international waters before returning. That ruling allows
foreign ships to operate gambling ``cruises to nowhere'' that
depart from an American port, travel briefly into international
waters and return to the same port without visiting another
country.
</P>
<P>
   Those types of cruises are operated by smaller foreign cruise
lines, operating from American ports, not the major lines.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to claim that business for American ships, Taylor won
House approval three times, from 1993 to 1995, for legislation that
would require foreign-registered vessels to stop at a foreign port
even on a ``cruise to nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   But each time the bill got to the Senate, at least one anonymous
senator put a hold on it, blocking any vote. Taylor said he was
unable to identify who stopped the measure, but he said he knows
who was behind it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I went to pass that bill in the House, I will
never forget what happened to me,'' Taylor said, describing a 1993
incident. ``As I'm walking across the street to go handle the bill
on the House floor, the chief lobbyist for the foreign cruise
industry comes up and offers me and my family a free cruise if I
withdraw my bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says, `It's just so that you get to know us.' It sure
sounded like a bribe to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said the lobbyist was Alcalde. In a written response,
Alcalde called the accusation reprehensible. He said that the
congressman misunderstood what he said and that he did not even
have the authority to offer anyone a free cruise.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL GRAFS FOLLOW)
</P>
<P>
   ``It is true that I suggested he inspect the cruise ships,''
Alcalde said. ``It is important that to take a position as a
legislator, one must understand the industries that they are
attempting to regulate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is also true that I suggested that they are an excellent
vacation, especially for families. Never did I offer Taylor any
favor or incentive, and I am truly sorry that he misunderstood
those words.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL GRAFS)
</P>
<P>
   The cruise trade group opposed Taylor's bill in 1992, telling
Congress it feared that the restrictions could be applied to
broadly to its members. The next year, the group said it could
support the bill with clarifications spelling out that it was aimed
at the ``cruise to nowhere'' trade.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's influence also paid dividends last October when
Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, preserved the monopoly held by foreign
cruise lines on entry permits to Glacier Bay National Park, one of
the most popular cruise destinations.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to increase competition for concession business at
national parks, Congress last year eliminated a long-standing
provision that allowed existing operators to retain concessions by
matching the best offer from any other company. The provision made
it virtually impossible for an outside company to win a concession.
</P>
<P>
   Among the parks that would have been opened to competition was
Glacier Bay, where concerns over the environment and wildlife have
restricted entry permits for ships. The day the bill passed the
House, Young, chairman of the Committee on Resources, inserted an
amendment extending the preference for operators at Glacier Bay
until 2009.

<P>
   Young has received about $45,000 in contributions from cruise
industry employees in recent years. One of his former staff members
also works as the chief lobbyist for Holland American Line, the
division of Carnival that has the most entry permits for Glacier
Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to interview Young over the course of a week were
unsuccessful. Last fall he said that retaining the preference was
necessary to avoid disrupting cruises and to protect Alaskan
tourism. ``Cruise ship companies depend on a smooth process for
bidding on permits to enter Glacier Bay in order to accommodate the
thousands of passengers who visit this park every year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Apgar, the National Park Service concession manager for
Alaska, said in an interview that the exemption was
anti-competitive and not necessary to ensure smooth cruise
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any justification for it,'' Apgar said. ``The
industry made a special pleading and got special treatment over all
the other large concessions nationwide.''
</P>
<P>
   Three American companies with smaller ships submitted proposals
last year for some of 42 new cruise-ship permits being awarded by
the Park Service, but their prospects are slim.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big operators still have a preference and we expect our
application to be denied,'' said Gary Sorrels, vice president of
American West Steamboat in Seattle, which is planning a
250-passenger cruise ship.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the National Park Service in Washington said they
expected to award most of the new permits to Holland America, which
they said submitted the best proposal, within the next few weeks.
The company promised new studies on the impact of cruise ship noise
on whales and said it would finance on-site equipment and personnel
to respond to an oil spill in the park.
</P>
<P>
   The award is likely despite Holland America's guilty plea last
August to discharging oily waste in the waters of Alaska's Inside
Passage. ``We're aware of the dumping, but Holland America's
proposal was very good,'' said Bill Pierce, the Alaska desk officer
at the park service.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ She was a big-eyed baby with a look that could only
be described as an impish grin. Her name was Kumari. Enchanting and
much beloved, she was the first elephant born at the National Zoo
in Washington, and hearts broke when she died there in 1995 at the
age of 16 months, after a brief and mysterious illness.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, Kumari's death has led to the discovery of a
herpes virus that researchers think is a major cause of death
worldwide among young Asian elephants in captivity, and a serious
threat to their conservation in zoos.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 50,000 Asian elephants remain in the wild, and their
endangered status makes them difficult or impossible to import.
Curators who hope to maintain the zoo population by breeding the
animals in captivity fear that the virus could wipe out the next
generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have a special feeling for elephants,'' said Dr.
Richard Montali, head of the pathology department at the
Smithsonian National Zoological Park. ``We want to be able to keep
them so our grandchildren will be able to see them and touch them
and smell them.''
</P>
<P>
   The deadly disease may be a direct result of human meddling: the
virus that killed Kumari and at least seven other young Asian
elephants may have been spread to them in zoos by African
elephants, a separate species with which they are often housed in
captivity but never encounter in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   Another victim of the disease was an 18-month-old male named
Astor, who died at the Bronx Zoo in 1983. At the time,
veterinarians had no idea what killed Astor, said James Doherty,
general curator of the zoo, but later tests of preserved tissue
samples revealed the same virus that killed Kumari.
</P>
<P>
   ``Astor was the first elephant born in New York in over 10,000
years,'' Doherty said. ``Sadly, he was also the last.''
</P>
<P>
   The fatal virus belongs to a diverse group of herpes viruses
that cause disease in people and animals. Human diseases caused by
different herpes viruses include cold sores, genital herpes,
chickenpox, shingles and mononucleosis. But the herpes virus
infecting the elephants bears little resemblance to previously
known forms, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   Famciclovir, a drug normally used to treat herpes infections in
people, appears to cure the illness in animals. But it is not an
ideal solution, researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you treat very early on, treatment could be
ineffective,'' Montali said. ``It's a terribly fast-acting virus.''
</P>
<P>
   Kumari died only five days after she fell ill.
</P>
<P>
   Montali and his colleagues described their discovery of the
virus Thursday in a news conference at the National Zoo, and in an
article being published Friday in the journal Science.
</P>
<P>
   The virus that killed Kumari is commonly found in both wild and
captive African elephants, in which it causes only minor skin
problems and genital sores. But turns deadly when it jumps species
to Asian elephants, particularly the young.
</P>
<P>
   The converse may be true as well, with Asians harboring a
different virus that is essentially harmless to them but lethal to
young African animals. Scientists have found evidence that a
different herpes virus, probably harmless in Asian elephants, might
have killed two young African elephants.

</P>
<P>
   Zoo curators are well aware of other closely related species of
animals that can kill each other if they trade viruses. Squirrel
monkeys, for instance, carry a herpes virus that is harmless to
them but fatal to tamarins, another South American species. They
are never housed together, Montali said. And Laura Richman said
that when other animals are bred for release into the wild, they
are kept apart from other species to prevent the spread of
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   In light of the new findings, the researchers said it might be
wise to separate baby elephants and their mothers from elephants of
the other species.
</P>
<P>
   But they emphasized that their research was too preliminary to
justify recommending that all elephants be separated according to
species. Before any guidelines can be developed, they said, it must
determined how the virus is transmitted from one animal to another.
</P>
<P>
   The hunt for the virus began when Kumari fell ill in 1995.
First, keepers noticed that she was off her feed. Abnormal blood
counts suggested that she might have a viral infection, but
veterinarians couldn't identify it.
</P>
<P>
   Then her face and neck began to swell. Her tongue, normally
pink, turned an alarming purplish blue, and soon after that she
died.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy showed extensive damage to blood vessels in Kumari's
heart, liver and tongue. Further tests revealed a herpes virus.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richman, who worked at the zoo when Kumari died, went back
to school in molecular biology at Johns Hopkins University in
Baltimore and continued to study the animal's tissue there.
</P>
<P>
   She compared the viral DNA to samples preserved from other
elephants that had died, as well as from healthy animals living in
zoos and in the wild in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   That work led her and her colleagues to conclude that seven
other young Asian elephants in the United States and Canada had
died from the same herpes virus as Kumari. They also found evidence
of the virus in tissue from elephants that had died in Germany,
Israel and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   News of the findings spread quickly through the tightly knit
world of elephant keepers and veterinarians, and probably saved the
lives of two young Asian elephants that later came down with the
same disease. The first was an 18-month-old female, Chandra, who
became ill in 1997 at the Springfield, Mo., zoo.
</P>
<P>
   No treatment was known, said Dr. Douglas Hardy, a veterinarian
at the zoo, but he and another veterinarian, Dr. Dennis Schmitt,
felt that they had to try something.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise,'' Hardy said, ``we were going to set there and
watch this animal die in front of us in two days.''
</P>
<P>
   They asked a specialist in human infectious disease to recommend
a drug that could be given for herpes. He suggested famciclovir.
</P>
<P>
   Zookeepers hid the pills in Chandra's favorite foods _ bananas,
apples and peanut butter sandwiches _ and coaxed her to eat. At
times she used her trunk to pick the pills out of the food and
fling them aside. But the keepers persevered, and it paid off:
Chandra recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Her case led other veterinarians to try famciclovir last
November in a sick 18-month-old male Asian elephant owned by the
Ringling Brothers and Barnum &AMP; Bailey circus in Polk County,
Florida. The patient recovered.
</P>
<P>
   That Florida case underlines puzzling aspects of the disease.
The elephant, Baby Doc, lives at an elephant conservation center
with only Asian elephants, so how he became infected is not clear.
</P>
<P>
   A few adult elephants at the center were probably exposed to
African elephants in the past, Lindsay said, but there is no test
yet to detect past exposure to the virus or determine whether some
Asian animals can act as carriers of the African virus.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Baby Doc's favorite playmate, a female elephant his
age, has remained perfectly healthy even though the two youngsters
frequently put their trunks in each other's mouths, Lindsay said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richman said she hoped to develop tests that would identify
carriers and shed light on how the virus is transmitted, to help
scientists devise strategies to prevent the disease. Ultimately,
she and Montali said, the best solution may be a vaccine, but that
is a long way off.

JUDGES SPAR OVER JURISDICTION IN CHILD ABUSE CASE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE LEE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Judges in Texas and Kentucky are vying for
control of five children who police and child welfare workers say
were neglected by their parents as the family traveled from town to
town on the stock car circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Tarrant County juvenile court Judge Ellen Smith wants to allow
Child Protective Services to put the children up for adoption,
partly because their parents kidnapped them from a foster home and
fled the state. District Judge Kimberly Shumate, in Elizabethtown,
Ky., wants to turn the children over to Kentucky child welfare
workers, who would like to reunite the family.
</P>
<P>
   The parents, Kathie and Doug Harless of Upton, Ky., said they
may ask the federal courts to resolve which state has jurisdiction
over the children. Both judges claim jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas may have had emergency custody jurisdiction, but should
have communicated with Kentucky as the home state of the children
before permanent decisions were made ...,'' Shumate wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In a reply, Smith wrote, ``Evidence elicited from the Harless
parents showed ... in fact they intended to make this state their
home.''
</P>
<P>
   The Harlesses contend that Texas Child Protective Services
workers have made up evidence to break up their family.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the very first court hearing there was a statement by CPS
that our children would never leave the state of Texas, and they
stood by it,'' Doug Harless said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   The Harlesses make their living selling T-shirts and ballcaps at
NASCAR races around the country, and they often travel with their
children, ages 5 to 16. The children are home-schooled.
</P>
<P>
   During the spring and summer of 1997, the family was in Tarrant
and Denton counties for the opening of Texas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Child Protective Services workers were alerted in April 1997,
when the family's oldest daughter said that her father threw her
against a wall at a North Richland Hills motel and slapped her
because she was with a boyfriend, according to a police report.
</P>
<P>
   No criminal charges were filed. Doug Harless said the mark that
police saw on his daughter's face was caused by a skin condition.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses, including James Dean Smith, a former employee of the
Harlesses, later told Child Protective Services that the children
wore the same dirty clothes for days and never received schooling.
Smith said he saw the oldest daughter ``backhanded across the
store'' by Doug Harless, according to a Child Protective Services
report.
</P>
<P>
   Child Protective Services workers also learned that the
Harlesses had been reported to child welfare workers in Bristol,
Tenn., and Talladega, Ala., in 1996. The Talladega investigation
found the children living in the trailer of an 18-wheeler,
according to court documents, and one of the children, age 9,
couldn't recite the alphabet. The Bristol investigation found
nothing because the Harlesses had moved.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 5, 1997, police and Child Protective Services workers
whisked the children from a Denton, Texas, motel room and placed
them in foster care.
</P>
<P>
   The Harlesses cooperated with the courts and Child Protective
Services for about a month after their children were put in foster
care in Tarrant County. A judge threw out most of the allegations
of abuse, leaving only the allegation that the Harlesses failed to
educate the children. But a court-appointed child advocate said the
children were ``of normal development and in appropriate grades for
their ages.''
</P>
<P>
   The two youngest children were returned to their parents, who
rented a house and were attending court-ordered parenting classes
and psychiatric evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1997, the Harlesses asked for an unsupervised visit
with their other children, contending that Child Protective
Services workers eavesdropped on them, according to court
documents. By the end of the Thanksgiving weekend, the Harlesses
and their four youngest children were gone. The oldest daughter
remained in Texas because she had refused to visit her parents,
according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
   In March, police found Kathie Harless and the children in
Atlanta. Doug Harless turned himself in to police in Pennsylvania.
The couple were extradited to Texas and served 60 days in Denton
County Jail for interference with child custody. The children were
placed in foster care in Texas, where they remain.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Harless said that he and his wife fled ``because we
couldn't get a fair trial in Texas'' and said that he wants the
children to be turned over to Kentucky authorities, not directly to
him and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I wasn't innocent, I would surely not be asking for my
children to be handed to the state of Kentucky,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harless also said that the allegations of abuse were made up by
a business competitor, and that the Texas complaints came from a
disgruntled former employee.
</P>
<P>
   Any education problems are caused by Child Protective Services'
misperception of home-schooling, he said. ``In some things, they
(the children) may be behind ... but they may be ahead in others,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Harlesses haven't been to Texas since their release from
jail, and Child Protective Services workers say the couple haven't
responded to notices about hearings. The couple went to Kentucky
after their release from jail.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Harless recently wrote a letter to Judge Ellen Smith saying
that he and his wife won't cooperate with any court plan that
includes putting the children up for adoption.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Riddick, a Child Protective Services spokesman, said the
agency is ``very hesitant about terminating parental rights. We try
to avoid breaking up families.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're still responsible for keeping the kids safe,'' he
said.

EDITORIAL: JUDGE WRIGHT'S OPTION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Feb. 19:
</P>
<P>
   Just as President Clinton's troubles seemed to be fading, the
federal district judge who presided in the Paula Jones
sexual-harassment lawsuit, Susan Webber Wright, has raised the
prospect of holding Clinton in contempt of court for the famously
false deposition testimony in which he denied having a relationship
with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's instincts here are sound. A civil contempt citation
would be a reasonable and proportional way to hold Clinton
accountable for his dishonesty under oath without disrupting the
presidency, and to vindicate the justice system's strong interest
in deterring such behavior by other litigants.
</P>
<P>
   Wright's interest in pursuing contempt is not new. She hinted at
it in a footnote when she issued an order last September. But as
the judge told lawyers in the Jones case this week, she has waited
until now to pursue the possibility of contempt so as not to
interfere with the impeachment process in Congress _ a model of
restraint that the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, regrettably
refused to follow.
</P>
<P>
   In paying $850,000 to get Ms. Jones to drop her legal appeal in
January, Clinton plainly hoped he was closing the book on the Jones
case. But that settlement did not absolve him of his culpability
for giving untruthful testimony. No settlement among private
parties to a lawsuit could. Truthfulness under oath is the business
of the court. For Wright to avoid making a judgment about the
legitimacy of the president's dissembling behavior in such a
prominent case would ignore her obligation to protect the court's
integrity.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Clinton lied in his civil deposition and that his
lying improperly obstructed the administration of justice does not
rise to an impeachable offense, nor does it merit separate
indictment. That does not mean, though, that it should be
overlooked by a federal judge. A citation for civil contempt and a
fine would be an appropriate punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Wright gave the president's lawyers until Friday to file motions
requesting her recusal on the matter. But the immediate impact of
her actions is to further weaken any argument that Starr might have
for pursuing the president.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate and the House dealt with the main charges against
Clinton in the way prescribed by the Constitution, obviating
further criminal prosecution by the independent counsel. A citation
by Wright would provide a legal reprimand for false testimony
without plunging a weary nation into a needless constitutional
controversy over the indictment of a sitting President or a former
one. &QL;

ACCOUNTANTS ARE PREPARING FOR MONTHS OF DEBATE OVER ABOLISHING A
RULE ON CORPORATE MERGERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Conn.)   (af)  
 By LAURA HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the first round of what is expected to turn into months of
intense lobbying and debate, the accounting establishment is set to
consider whether the most favored method companies now use to
account for mergers should be abolished.
</P>
<P>
   The Financial Accounting Standards Board, which sets the
nation's accounting rules, has been seeking comment from investment
bankers, corporate executives and others on a controversial plan to
limit the pooling-of-interest method of accounting, which allows
merged corporations to combine assets and report financial
information as if the companies had always been one.
</P>
<P>
   To the uninitiated, the proposed change sounds like just another
yawnfest best left to pencil pushers. But if adopted, it could
radically alter the way mergers are done in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   That is because the standards board would like most mergers to
be treated as purchases. Under that method, the price above the
acquired company's net worth is treated as good will, which must be
written off against the acquiring company's earnings, often over
several years. The deadline for comments to the standards board was
Feb. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Most deal makers involved in big-ticket megamergers prefer the
pooling-of-interest method. While less than 5 percent of all
announced domestic deals last year were done using pooling of
interest, the dollar value of those mergers amounted to 52.5
percent of all deals, according to Securities Data Co.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the method say it allows executives to make huge
acquisitions and leave barely a trace of what may have been an
ill-advised move or an excessive price in the accounting ledgers.
</P>
<P>
   Investment banks are concerned that a change in the accounting
rules would bring merger activity to a grinding halt. If a merger
is accounted for as a purchase, some people fear the acquirer will
be unjustly punished by analysts and investors who judge companies
and their peers primarily on quarterly earnings per share. Certain
industries, like banking, which has strict capital rules, could
also find the rules too restrictive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any change is sure to have an immediate impact on corporations
and investment banks,'' said Janet Pegg, an accounting analyst at
Bear, Stearns. But, she added, ``People should understand that it
is just bookkeeping.''
</P>
<P>
   Merger activity should not fade if the tenets of the current
boom hold true for the future _ that deals are done for competitive
reasons, not because of fancy financial engineering. If the
strategic rationale for a merger prevails, industry professionals
say, the accounting method should not matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I look at it, you have to look at what's behind the
numbers,'' said Tim O'Neil, a wireless communications analyst at
Soundview Technology Group in Stamford, Conn. ``A write-off of good
will has nothing to do with whether the transaction is good or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the number of cross-border deals is increasing and
regulators are more than eager to make United States accounting
rules on par with those in foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Borders are not borders with trans-country transactions any
more,'' said Lynn Turner, chief accountant at the Securities and
Exchange Commission. ``For most businesses, even small companies,
your business is conducted on an international basis.''
</P>
<P>
   And the standards board is hoping too that the change will aid
investors who want to better evaluate whether a proposed merger
makes sense. The mission of the board's review, said Kim Petrone,
project manager for business combinations, is to improve the
disclosure of financial reports. ``Pooling, you could say, masks
disclosure,'' she said. ``You don't get full information.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite the debate expected in the year ahead, changes are
far from certain. Analysts say the standards board expects to have
a first draft of a proposed rule completed by this summer, which
bankers and corporate executives will comment on.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on how smoothly that process goes, new accounting
rules might not be introduced until the end of 2000. Then deals
will still be done, although cash takeovers are likely to reappear
in greater numbers.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, warned Jack Ciesielski, publisher of the
Analyst's Accounting Observer, corporate executives can expect to
hear a lot of hype from bankers to get their deals done before the
new rules take effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same old end-of-Western-civilization argument that
gets made whenever there is an accounting rule change,'' he said.
``There are players out there who do deals just to do deals. Maybe
some of them will go away.''

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Feb. 19:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the trustees of Dartmouth College to improve
campus life by making fraternities and sororities substantially
coed and reining in alcohol abuse is perhaps surprising from an
institution where fraternities have been a tradition since the
1840s and whose frat parties inspired the movie ``Animal House.''
</P>
<P>
   Piggish behavior has been tamped down in recent decades, but the
Dartmouth trustees are steering in the right direction when they
question the role of fraternities as a means of social
organization. Their move ought to inspire leaders at other colleges
to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   The very selectiveness of the Greek houses is what makes them
desirable to students who naturally crave a sense of belonging. But
that exclusivity often works against efforts by college
administrators to create an inclusive atmosphere for all students.
</P>
<P>
   At their worst, fraternities and sororities perpetuate social
cliques. Their unsupervised parties can encourage excessive
drinking. They may intensify fragmentation of the student body into
ethnic and income groups. On smaller campuses, they can dominate
social life so completely that there are limited options for
socializing outside of the frat-sponsored mixer.
</P>
<P>
   The Dartmouth faculty recommended in 1978 that fraternities and
sororities be abolished, believing that they fostered
anti-intellectualism and sexism. A more recent report from the
college's committee on diversity and community leveled similar
criticisms. It noted that the system tended to create a climate
detrimental to the college's academic mission. But the trustees are
also aware that they cannot simply abandon the Greek system without
replacing it with new types of housing and student gathering spots.
They say they are prepared to make the necessary investments.
</P>
<P>
   Many colleges, including Dartmouth, have long relied on
fraternities and sororities, despite their flaws, to provide
students with social activities and opportunities for friendship
and emotional support. Many Dartmouth students support the Greek
system because there is little else available. Reducing the role of
Greek houses means college administrators will have to shoulder
more responsibility for meeting the social needs of their students.

   If Louis XIV had owned a baseball team, he probably would have
run it the way George Steinbrenner does. Steinbrenner's latest
acquisition is Roger Clemens, one of the most overpowering pitchers
ever to play the game. It almost seems unfair to the rest of the
American League for the Yankees to add Clemens to the roster after
they completed the most successful season in baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   Until Major League Baseball figures out how to keep less
profitable franchises in contention, prosperous teams like the
Yankees will continue to sweep up the best players.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees gave up a fine pitcher, David Wells, and two less
accomplished players to get Clemens from the Toronto Blue Jays.
Wells delighted New Yorkers with his proletarian attire and tastes,
and won their admiration with his determination and strong arm.
</P>
<P>
   The perfect game he threw against the Minnesota Twins last May
was the crown jewel in a dazzling year in which he won 18 games and
the Yankees won 125. More than most of his teammates, Wells seemed
to appreciate the intangible magic of serving in a line that runs
through Ruth, Gehrig and DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   Tinkering with a winning team can produce unintended
consequences, the reason the Yankees opened spring training
Thursday with 24 of 25 players returning from last season. Still,
it is hard to imagine that the arrival of Clemens will not enhance
an already powerful squad.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens won 20 games last year, the fifth time in his career he
has reached or exceeded that mark of pitching excellence. He also
won his fifth Cy Young award as the best pitcher in the American
League. Though he is 36 and prone to injury, Clemens still throws a
blistering fastball and strikes out more hitters than any other
American League pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   This is not exactly what other teams had in mind when they
privately wished that Steinbrenner would break up the Yankees.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Kevin Lee wanted to be an accountant. But that was
before Lee, a 22-year-old student at New York University, worked
one summer at a New Jersey accounting firm. ``Accounting is
stable,'' he said, ``but it's not exciting because you're doing the
same thing over and over.'' And he says he can make much more
working on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of young people are reaching such conclusions these days.
A result is a worsening shortage of accountants, even as the demand
for qualified accountants rises amid a boom in small risk-taking
companies whose books cry out for careful scrutiny. That has raised
concerns about a corresponding decline in the quality of auditors
as the profession reaches deeper to fill its ranks.
</P>
<P>
   From Georgetown University to the University of Colorado, the
number of students graduating with an accounting degree this spring
will be only about half what it was a few years ago. Accounting
professors fret about classrooms that seem empty. The largest
accounting firms, in the midst of their busy season, are
aggressively recruiting liberal arts majors, science majors _ any
student with an affinity for numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're too short now,'' said Herb Schoenfeld, who runs his own
accounting firm in Woodbury, N.Y. ``It's almost impossible to find
people. Every good accountant is working.''
</P>
<P>
   As accountants debate what to do, the profession's largest and
most powerful group has proposed making the job more attractive by,
in part, reducing the requirements. The group is lobbying state
legislatures to eliminate the two years of on-the-job experience
that most accountants now need at a public accounting firm to earn
the right to put the letters CPA _ for certified public accountant
_ behind their name. And the group also wants to rewrite the tough
exam that accountants consider a rite of passage.
</P>
<P>
   But some accountants, regulators and investors adamantly oppose
the plan, saying it makes about as much sense as lowering the
standards for emergency-room nurses or police officers if shortages
developed in those jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not in the public's best interest,'' wrote members of
the National Conference of CPA Practitioners, a group that
represents about 1,000 small accounting firms, in a letter to the
much-larger American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the
group that is pushing to relax the standards.
</P>
<P>
   But almost everyone agrees that something must be done quickly.
Even before the recent steep declines on many campuses, the number
of people sitting for the CPA exam had declined by 15 percent
between 1990 and 1997. And even as the number of public companies
in the United States has grown by more than 20 percent in the last
10 years, the number of professionals in public accounting has
remained almost unchanged at roughly 131,000.
</P>
<P>
   While some may not see the urgency of finding more people
wanting to do what many like to refer to as counting beans, public
accountants play a key role: acting as watchdogs for the millions
of Americans who are investors. Ever since the Depression, every
public company has been required by law to hire outside auditors to
review its financial reports and give an independent, expert
opinion on whether the numbers reported by corporate executives are
trustworthy.
</P>
<P>
   Computerization has eased some of the crunch by allowing
accounting firms to send fewer accountants out on some jobs.
Nonetheless, many financial experts say that, given the
freewheeling finances of so many of America's newest companies in
industries like high technology, there has never been a greater
need for sharp, tough auditors.
</P>
<P>
   John C. Bogle, the founder of the Vanguard Group, the giant
mutual fund company, said it ``would be very troublesome'' to relax
the standards for public accountants. ``It is full disclosure and
accurate financial statements,'' he said, ``that are the basis for
our capital market system.''
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, the laws of supply and demand would take care of any
shortage, by raising accountants' salaries to make the profession
more enticing. And certainly, accountants would like little more
than being able to charge more for their services. But they find
corporate clients reluctant to pay much for their annual audits,
even if that stinginess means running a higher risk of later being
sued by shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Because the large accounting firms cannot pay as much as
investment banks, which also hire bright students with accounting
degrees, more accounting majors like Kevin Lee are choosing a Wall
Street career instead.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At Lee's school, Paul R. Brown, chairman of New York
University's accounting department, said that while the accounting
rolls are down only slightly, more accounting majors are showing
little interest in actually becoming licensed as CPAs.
</P>
<P>
   Other students are changing their majors from accounting to
information technology, intending to become consultants, a job they
view as more glamorous and possibly more lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Colorado in Colorado Springs, Professor
Paul B.W. Miller has only 13 students in his intermediate
accounting course this semester, down from 23 last year.
</P>
<P>
   And, at McDonough School of Business at Georgetown University,
Scott Whisenant, an accounting professor, said 50 percent fewer
students are expected to graduate with degrees in accounting this
spring than in 1996. ``We're seeing the really bright students
deciding not to become auditors,'' Whisenant said. ``What does this
mean when it comes to the quality of future auditors?''
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 results of the CPA test, which all accountants must
pass as lawyers must pass the bar exam, provide some evidence that
Whisenant's observation may be true. In November 1997, according to
the National Association of State Boards of Accountancy, which
represents the licensing bodies in each state, only 12.5 percent of
the candidates taking the test for the first time passed all four
parts _ the lowest percentage since 1985, the year the association
began keeping track.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission say they
already see signs that auditors' work may be slipping. Indeed, the
accounting firms that audited companies like Cendant Corp., Waste
Management and Livent Inc. have recently been sued after some
numbers in the financial statements proved to be wishful thinking.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL GRAF FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   The commission has formed an expert panel to study why auditors
failed to detect some of the recent high-profile financial frauds.
Regulators say they worry that some auditors may lack the
experience needed to spot problems at companies with complex
operations. The regulators have told the big accounting firms that
``it is essential'' for experienced partners to spend more time on
complicated audits rather than leaving most of the work to auditors
fresh out of school.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL GRAF)
</P>
<P>
   Lynn E. Turner, the commission's chief accountant, said this
week that the proposal to reduce the on-the-job experience
requirement for auditors might only make matters worse. ``The
classroom is a great primer,'' Turner said, ``but it sure doesn't
get you there.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders at the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants, the national organization that administers the test
aspiring accountants must take to be certified, say they do not
believe their efforts to relax the experience requirements will
hurt auditors' competence. Instead, they say, the changes are
needed to attract talented people back to the profession.
</P>
<P>
   Because fewer accountants are choosing to work as auditors at
public accounting accounting firms, institute officials say that
accountants should no longer be required to work at a public
accounting firm for two years as an outside auditor to be licensed
as a CPA. They are asking state legislatures to change laws to
require only one year of experience, which could be obtained by
working for any licensed accountant, even one who works only as a
personal financial planner.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL GRAFS FOLLOW)
</P>
<P>
   Barry C. Melancon, the institute's president, said the new
experience requirements would include measures aimed at maintaining
high quality audits. For example, accountants supervising an audit,
he said, would be required to have much more experience than other
accountants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quality of auditors is going to improve in this
environment,'' Melancon said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL GRAFS)
</P>
<P>
   The institute has flexed its political muscles before to get the
majority of states to pass its proposals. For example, in recent
years, the institute has asked the states to pass a proposal that
would require CPAs to have 150 hours of college credit, up from 120
hours. Almost every state has now passed that measure.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, the institute has worked to gain new members
and make the profession more attractive by pushing accountants into
new fields like financial planning. After the institute's lobbying
efforts, more state legislatures have recently passed laws that
allow CPAs to earn commissions by selling such things as stocks and
computer software.
</P>
<P>
   The institute's leaders have even suggested stripping the words
``public accountant'' from the once-coveted CPA title so that it
stands instead for ``certified professional adviser,'' signaling
that the career is about more than just numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the institute has raised concerns among some of its
members by proposing changes to the exhausting two-day
15-and-a-half-hour exam that is used to weed out those that lack
the knowledge, skills or stamina to be an accountant.
</P>
<P>
   The test would be shortened so that accountants would have to
pass only two sections rather than the four sections now required.
</P>
<P>
   The pencil-and-paper exam would be changed so that candidates
would be tested on a computer. The exam would be interactive, so
that if candidates score well early in the test, they would have
fewer questions to answer.
</P>
<P>
   (ALL REMAINING GRAFS OPTIONAL)
</P>
<P>
   Arleen R. Thomas, the institute's vice president for
professional standards, said the exam would still cover the same
material. ``We don't want to change the difficulty of the CPA
test,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas, Paul Allen, the chairman of the state's board of
accountancy, which licenses CPAs in the state, said board members
were concerned about the institute's proposal to reduce the work
experience needed to be a CPA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only by real-life experience in public accounting,''
Allen said, ``that you can gain the skills and the objectivity that
we believe are key qualities of our profession.''
</P>
<P>
   Labor experts say other professions have tinkered with their
qualifying standards when there were either too few or too many
applicants. Peter Capelli, a management professor at the Wharton
School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, said the
number of flight hours needed by airline pilots had been raised and
lowered over the years depending on the number of pilots needed.
</P>
<P>
   And, in the early 1900s, Capelli said, the medical profession
raised its requirements when a glut of doctors appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Some accountants say they believe, if anything, that raising the
bar is the answer, even for the shortage in their profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toughening the standards increases the prestige and
attractiveness of a profession,'' said Howard Schilit, the founder
of the Center for Financial Research and Analysis in Rockville,
Md., which provides independent financial research to institutional
investors.

EDITORIAL: TEXACO AND ECUADOR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Feb. 19:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1964 Ecuador invited TexPet, a subsidiary of Texaco, to drill
for oil in the Amazon rain forest of the country's east. Texaco and
Ecuador's government, its partner, made Ecuador into a major oil
exporter _ but at a price. Now a group of indigenous people who
live in the rain forest are suing Texaco over environmental damage,
which they say has contaminated their water, killed their food
supply and caused disease.
</P>
<P>
   The question before U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff is whether he
should heed the plaintiffs and hear the case in Manhattan _ Texaco
is based in nearby White Plains _ or send it to Ecuador, as Texaco
prefers. Rakoff dismissed the suit once, but it was reinstated by
an appeals court. Now he should allow the case to be heard in the
only forum that can provide a fair trial and enforce penalties, an
American court.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs contend that the practices used in disposing of
waste oil and oil-contaminated water caused skin and respiratory
infections and other diseases. While there has been no major
scientific study of health conditions, researchers from the Harvard
School of Public Health, whose work was financed in part by the
plaintiffs, found that the local water contains dangerous levels of
carcinogens.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental damage is visible _ the soil is covered with a
salty crust and dotted with viscous black pools, which sometimes
overflow or burn and fill the air with black particles. Residents
say the aquatic animals they used to eat have died and that child
malnutrition is widespread. Texaco questions the validity of the
studies and maintains that some of the destruction may be due to
the influx of people to the zone as it developed economically.
</P>
<P>
   One of the issues before Rakoff is whether the decision on waste
disposal was made by officials of the drilling partnership in
Ecuador, as Texaco contends, or by Texaco officials in the United
States. This will be settled during the trial, but the plaintiffs
argue that Texaco closely managed even small decisions in its
Ecuador operations. A $40 million payment that Texaco made to
Ecuador's government in 1995 for cleanup has not eliminated the
problems and does not absolve the company of further responsibility
to assist the local population.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador's courts cannot handle the case or enforce a judgment.
Ecuador does not admit class-action suits, has no experience with
cases like this one and relegates all environmental disputes to an
administrative tribunal, where the largest fine has been a few
thousand dollars. This case belongs in an American court, where the
contesting claims can be fairly weighed.  &QL;

 &HT;    Texas Senate passes school promotion bill
 &HT;    By A. Phillips Brooks
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush's major educational
initiative to end automatic student promotions won unanimous
approval by the Senate on Thursday, and now faces a tougher sell in
the House, lawmakers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an incredibly positive bill for the future of Texas,''
said an exuberant Bush, who came to the Senate floor to watch the
vote. ``This says we're going to diagnose children early in their
school careers and give them extra help, extra time on tasks to
make sure nobody is left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's bill sailed through the Senate, picking up bipartisan
support after key changes stipulated that students who flunk the
state skills exam could appeal to their local schools, and that
school districts could disregard the entire bill if the state
failed to finance remedial programs.
</P>
<P>
   Those revisions were enough to appease critics, including Sen.
Royce West (D-Dallas) and Sen. Greg Luna (D-San Antonio), who now
back the bill sponsored by Sen. Teel Bivins (R-Amarillo).
</P>
<P>
   Their support should help ease concerns by Democrats and
minority lawmakers that the measure puts too much emphasis on the
Texas Assessment of Academic Skills, known as TAAS, and falls short
of addressing the causes for student failures.
</P>
<P>
   Bush already has positioned himself nationally as a leader in
the education field, winning passage of legislation that fortified
reading programs in elementary grades and a bill that significantly
raised curriculum standards for all Texas public schools. Those
initiatives are credited with strident educational gains of Texas
students, who passed the TAAS in record numbers last year and
surpassed other students on some national skills exams.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's slam dunk victory in the Senate is expected to help
boost Bush's standing nationally as a presidential candidate, but
the victory is incomplete without House approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still going to have our love-in with the governor, but
we're going to have to take a hard look at it and answer the
question, `Does it really benefit students?''' said Rep. Harold
Dutton (D-Houston), vice chairman of the House Public Education
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is positive about his measure's success in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wisdom of the bill as witnessed here on the Senate floor
is so overpowering that I think it's going to have a very good
chance,'' Bush said when asked about the bill's chances in the
House.
</P>
<P>
   But lawmakers are already saying privately that it is to the
House's advantage to slow the bill's momentum.
</P>
<P>
   If the House moves too swiftly, it loses bargaining power with
Bush and the Senate over other big-budget items, such as teacher
salaries, college scholarships and the size of tax cuts. Other
controversial measures, such as vouchers aimed at using public tax
dollars to finance tuition at private schools, also are weighing
in.
</P>
<P>
   Political considerations aside, the bill also is expected to
move slowly because Rep. Paul Sadler (D-Henderson) head of the
House Education Committee, will take his usual methodical approach
to dealing with major legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed ``professor Sadler'' because of his scholarly approach _
calling in researchers, educators and the public before devising a
bill _ Sadler said he again will go to the blackboard in the coming
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to examine the issue in great detail,'' Sadler
said. ``We're going to have people give us the opportunity to teach
us about it and see what drops out.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadler said his committee would explore mandatory,
state-financed preschool for 4-year-olds, kindergarten for
5-year-olds and a Head Start program for 3-year-olds. Private
schooling for those grades could be substituted for public schools,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he had any concerns about Senate Bill 1 in its
current form, Sadler answered: ``Costs. I'm concerned that it takes
more money than we think to do it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaigned for re-election on the initiative to end
so-called social promotion _ the practice of advancing failing
students to keep them with their peers _ and it stands as a
centerpiece for his legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Under the measure passed Thursday, which Bivins helped shaped
into its current form, the 1999 kindergarten class would have to
pass the TAAS _ which measures basic skills in reading, writing and
mathematics _ in the third, fifth and eighth grades before being
promoted to the next grade. Students would get multiple tries to
pass the TAAS and would get extra help each time they flunked. A
student who fails after multiple tries still could pass by
unanimous agreement of the student's parent, teacher and principal.
</P>
<P>
   Bivins said the measure is needed to rescue _ not retain _
failing kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is designed to ... say to them, `We're not going to let you
fall through the cracks.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997-98 school year, 219,000 third-graders took the
reading TAAS and about 42,000 failed. Of those, about 38,000 were
promoted to fourth grade.
</P>
<P>
   The measure will be accompanied by $203 million in state aid to
finance remedial and summer school programs.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure that school districts will not be saddled with
additional costs, West amended the bill so that future
Legislature's would have to finance tutoring, summer school or
other remedial programs. If new state aid is not appropriated for
such measures, then school districts could do away with what West
said amounted to an unfunded mandate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to hold our children accountable, then we need
to make sure we have provided the necessary resources,'' West said.
``We will not send unfunded mandates down to our school
districts.''

 MIAMI: Florida ports.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There has never been a serious effort to alter the tax rules,
and the industry has developed an effective lobbying presence in
Washington to protect its interests.
</P>
<P>
   While all the members of the International Council of Cruise
Lines are foreign businesses, campaign finance law allows the
organization to have political action committees and raise
donations from cruise line employees who are U.S. citizens. In the
1997-98 election cycle the group donated $166,146 to House and
Senate candidates, according to the Center for Responsive Politics,
a nonpartisan organization in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The council spent more on lobbying. In its latest full-year
report filed with the Senate, it said it spent $557,023 on lobbying
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the money, $380,000, went to the law firm of Alcalde &AMP;
Fay for work on tax and immigration issues. The firm, which is run
by Hector Alcalde, a former congressional staff member, received an
additional $200,000 in the first half of 1998. Alcalde is the
father of Cynthia Colenda, who worked at his firm before taking
over as president of the International Council of Cruise Lines.
</P>
<P>
   The effectiveness of the lobbying was evident in the budget bill
for the current fiscal year. An innocuous-looking item, Section
114, amended the immigration act by inserting a single word,
``state,'' and a comma. Doing so eliminated as much as $20 million
a year in fees from cruise lines.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service had been authorized
to assess $6 per passenger to cover inspection costs for people
arriving in American ports on cruise ships, unless their cruise had
begun in Canada, Mexico or a U.S. territory. Adding ``state''
expanded the exemption to passengers whose travel started in the
United States _ eliminating the fee for all but the tiny number of
transoceanic passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The immigration service calculated that the change cost it $20
million a year, a spokesman, Greg Gagne, said. ``We were aware that
it was going in, but it certainly wasn't our choice or our
preference,'' he said. ``We think all carriers should share in the
cost equally.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, however, the fee had not been assessed in recent years.
Gagne and industry representatives said they did not know why.
</P>
<P>
   The change originated in the Senate, but records do not identify
its author. Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, chairman of the
Appropriations Committee, said through a spokeswoman that he knew
who wrote the section and that he had approved it, but he refused
to identify the senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Stevens is respecting the confidentiality rules of the
Senate,'' the spokeswoman, Jen Siciliano, said.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor ran into similar secrecy when he tried to close a
loophole that allows the foreign-registered cruise lines to operate
gambling cruises out of American ports.
</P>
<P>
   Under a century-old law intended to protect the American
shipping industry, ships flying foreign flags cannot travel between
American ports or leave from and return to the same American port
unless they visit a foreign port as part of the voyage. That is why
foreign cruise ships sailing from Miami or San Diego stop at a
foreign location before returning, a practice critics call
``cleansing the voyage'' for tax purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The Customs Service, however, ruled that foreign vessels meet
the requirement in some cases if they merely sail three miles out
into international waters before returning. That ruling allows
foreign ships to operate gambling ``cruises to nowhere'' that
depart from an American port, travel briefly into international
waters and return to the same port without visiting another
country.
</P>
<P>
   Those types of cruises are operated by smaller foreign cruise
lines, operating from American ports, not the major lines.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to claim that business for American ships, Taylor won
House approval three times, from 1993 to 1995, for legislation that
would require foreign-registered vessels to stop at a foreign port
even on a ``cruise to nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   But each time the bill got to the Senate, at least one anonymous
senator put a hold on it, blocking any vote. Taylor said he was
unable to identify who stopped the measure, but he said he knows
who was behind it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I went to pass that bill in the House, I will
never forget what happened to me,'' Taylor said, describing a 1993
incident. ``As I'm walking across the street to go handle the bill
on the House floor, the chief lobbyist for the foreign cruise
industry comes up and offers me and my family a free cruise if I
withdraw my bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says, `It's just so that you get to know us.' It sure
sounded like a bribe to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said the lobbyist was Alcalde. In a written response,
Alcalde called the accusation reprehensible. He said that the
congressman misunderstood what he said and that he did not even
have the authority to offer anyone a free cruise.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL GRAFS FOLLOW)
</P>
<P>
   ``It is true that I suggested he inspect the cruise ships,''
Alcalde said. ``It is important that to take a position as a
legislator, one must understand the industries that they are
attempting to regulate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is also true that I suggested that they are an excellent
vacation, especially for families. Never did I offer Taylor any
favor or incentive, and I am truly sorry that he misunderstood
those words.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL GRAFS)
</P>
<P>
   The cruise trade group opposed Taylor's bill in 1992, telling
Congress it feared that the restrictions could be applied to
broadly to its members. The next year, the group said it could
support the bill with clarifications spelling out that it was aimed
at the ``cruise to nowhere'' trade.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's influence also paid dividends last October when
Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, preserved the monopoly held by foreign
cruise lines on entry permits to Glacier Bay National Park, one of
the most popular cruise destinations.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to increase competition for concession business at
national parks, Congress last year eliminated a long-standing
provision that allowed existing operators to retain concessions by
matching the best offer from any other company. The provision made
it virtually impossible for an outside company to win a concession.
</P>
<P>
   Among the parks that would have been opened to competition was
Glacier Bay, where concerns over the environment and wildlife have
restricted entry permits for ships. The day the bill passed the
House, Young, chairman of the Committee on Resources, inserted an
amendment extending the preference for operators at Glacier Bay
until 2009.

   Young has received about $45,000 in contributions from cruise
industry employees in recent years. One of his former staff members
also works as the chief lobbyist for Holland American Line, the
division of Carnival that has the most entry permits for Glacier
Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to interview Young over the course of a week were
unsuccessful. Last fall he said that retaining the preference was
necessary to avoid disrupting cruises and to protect Alaskan
tourism. ``Cruise ship companies depend on a smooth process for
bidding on permits to enter Glacier Bay in order to accommodate the
thousands of passengers who visit this park every year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Apgar, the National Park Service concession manager for
Alaska, said in an interview that the exemption was
anti-competitive and not necessary to ensure smooth cruise
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any justification for it,'' Apgar said. ``The
industry made a special pleading and got special treatment over all
the other large concessions nationwide.''
</P>
<P>
   Three American companies with smaller ships submitted proposals
last year for some of 42 new cruise-ship permits being awarded by
the Park Service, but their prospects are slim.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big operators still have a preference and we expect our
application to be denied,'' said Gary Sorrels, vice president of
American West Steamboat in Seattle, which is planning a
250-passenger cruise ship.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the National Park Service in Washington said they
expected to award most of the new permits to Holland America, which
they said submitted the best proposal, within the next few weeks.
The company promised new studies on the impact of cruise ship noise
on whales and said it would finance on-site equipment and personnel
to respond to an oil spill in the park.
</P>
<P>
   The award is likely despite Holland America's guilty plea last
August to discharging oily waste in the waters of Alaska's Inside
Passage. ``We're aware of the dumping, but Holland America's
proposal was very good,'' said Bill Pierce, the Alaska desk officer
at the park service.

 &HT;    Fruit mamey suspected culprit of Florida typhoid fever outbreak
 &HT;    By Peter Donald
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ State officials said Thursday night that
the fruit mamey _ particularly a frozen variety from Guatemala used
to make shakes _ is the suspected source of a typhoid fever
outbreak that has sickened at least 14 people in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Preliminary findings suggest that the cases are related to
mamey, especially frozen mamey,'' said Dr. Bob Brooks, secretary of
the Florida Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks urged consumers to avoid eating mamey and businesses to
stop using it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a frozen fruit mixed to make a smoothie type drink,''
said Marion Fuller, director of food safety for the Department of
Agriculture. ``We have been in contact with distributors and
retailers. It's not widely distributed.''
</P>
<P>
   Agricultural officials said they were working with the health
department to stop mamey sales. Many distributors and retailers
were voluntarily cooperating to keep the frozen mamey product,
which is imported from Guatemala, out of stores, Fuller said.
</P>
<P>
   The bacteria that cause typhoid fever can survive being frozen
for a prolonged time, said Dr. Jean Malecki, Palm Beach County's
health director.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't clear Thursday, she said, where the frozen mamey was
being processed and whether it could have been contaminated in
Guatemala or after arriving in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve of the 14 people with typhoid fever had reported eating
mamey before getting sick, she said. Two _ a Hypoluxo man and a
Miami-Dade County resident _ had eaten the fruit in shake form at a
Palm Beach County restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Once the restaurant was told of the possible link to typhoid
fever, the managers stopped selling the mamey shakes, she said. The
mamey used to make the shakes had been shipped in December and was
eaten by the Hypoluxo man before he started feeling sick on Jan.
24, Malecki said.
</P>
<P>
   Malecki declined to identify the restaurant, saying it had not
done anything wrong and noting that the product is also sold in
other locations.
</P>
<P>
   The product used to make the shakes is sold primarily in
specialty-based, Hispanic markets.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past five years, from 15 to 41 cases of typhoid fever
have been reported annually in Florida. But this year's outbreak is
different because the sick people had not traveled to countries
where the bacterial illness is more common.
</P>
<P>
   All but two of Florida's 14 typhoid fever cases occurred among
people of Hispanic origin, health officials said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, tests from the state's Jacksonville laboratory
confirmed that the Hypoluxo man, who has been seriously ill, had
typhoid fever. Officials were still awaiting test results from
another suspected case _ this one involving a three-year-old Lake
Worth boy receiving outpatient treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The Hypoluxo man, 30, was not Hispanic but lived in a Hispanic
household, Malecki said.
</P>
<P>
   The first confirmed case in the recent outbreak occurred in
Pinellas County at the end of December. Health records show that an
18-year-old Hispanic woman was diagnosed with typhoid fever after
giving birth to a healthy child.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the state's typhoid fever cases have been clustered
in Miami-Dade County, where the health department has identified
six confirmed and five suspected cases since early January. All but
one of those patients are Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators there have been scrambling to determine a link
between the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Sanderson, regional epidemiologist with the state Bureau
of Epidemiology, said investigators used DNA fingerprinting to
identify the strain of Salmonella typhi bacteria that caused the
typhoid fever. Investigators realized that at least five of this
year's cases are linked because they involved the same strain.
</P>
<P>
   While mamey is the suspected source of infection, health
officials said they could not identify it as the culprit with
scientific certainty. The state lab is now testing the frozen mamey
used to make shakes (known as ``batidos'' in Spanish.) Results
aren't expected until next week.
</P>
<P>
   But enough epidemiologial evidence existed for them to go public
with their suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Roberta Hammond _ a state environmental epidemiologist _
said random telephone calls located healthy people who could be
compared to the typhoid fever victims. Four ``controls'' _ or
people who were not sick _ were selected for each sick person.
</P>
<P>
   When health officials compared the sick people to the healthy
people, it was clear that those with typhoid fever were far more
likely to have eaten mamey, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The differentials provide the clues,'' Hammond said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, raspberries grown on Guatemalan farms were linked to
1,300 cases of cyclospora infection reported in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American public expects what they eat and drink to be
healthy. And I don't think that's one (an expectation) that should
be out of the question,'' Malecki said. ``It's something that needs
to be a reality.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   It sound likes a Middle Eastern potentate or a virility
enhancer, but the Grand Vitara is actually the first well-rounded
sport utility vehicle Suzuki has offered in the United States.
Previous models like the tippy Samurai and the tinny Sidekick were
simply not competent enough to be taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Vitara competes in a four-door compact utility segment
that includes the Isuzu Amigo, Kia Sportage, Toyota RAV4, Honda
CR-V, Subaru Forester and its own assembly-line twins, the
Chevrolet (formerly Geo) Tracker and Suzuki (plain, not Grand)
Vitara. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sport utilities in this class have to wear a multitude of
marketing hats. They must have a supple ride; a reasonable number
of creature comforts often including air-conditioning, cruise
control and power windows, and some off-road capability. And they
must provide all of this at base prices of $20,000 or less. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Vitara hits nearly every target, and those it misses _
the ride is a bit harsh, the price is a little high _ it skirts by
a small margin. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the base Vitara and the Chevrolet Tracker are equipped
with a 2-liter four-cylinder engine, the Grand Vitara has a
2.5-liter V6, the only six-cylinder available in this type of
vehicle. The test truck was a top-of-the-line four-door JLX-Plus
model with a sticker total of $21,429.
</P>
<P>
   It had part-time four-wheel drive, which is not to be driven on
dry pavement; dual air bags; power windows, locks and mirrors; air
conditioning; anti-lock brakes; cruise control; keyless entry, and
more. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly handsome in ``Mars red'' (that's burgundy to you)
with silver lower-body cladding, the JLX-Plus was perfect for
running errands. With a length of 164 inches, 11 inches shorter
than the Forester and 13 shorter than the CR-V, its compact size
can make a big difference when trying to slip into a parking space
too tiny for most cars. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The front cloth seats were extremely comfortable, and the tilt
wheel made it easy to find a satisfactory position. The view from
behind the wheel was panoramic.
</P>
<P>
   The instrument panel is laid out logically, with analog
speedometer, tachometer, water temperature and fuel gauges. The
center console has recesses for two cups; unfortunately, when the
hand brake is released or the transfer case is shifted into
four-wheel drive, it's easy to bump into the cups, splashing their
contents. I speak from experience. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stalks on the steering column control lights, cruise control and
windshield wipers. When set to intermittent mode, the wipers make a
disconcerting clicking sound each time they sweep. The small and
somewhat obtuse radio controls proved challenging. We finally gave
up attempting to decipher the seek and scan functions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The power window and door lock controls are on the driver's
door; unfortunately, there are no power lock switches anywhere
else, forcing passengers to wrestle manually with the slender
door-lock button or wait for the driver to unlock their doors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although promoted as its main feature, the Vitara's engine _ a
2.5-liter, 24-valve, 4-cam V6 _ is its greatest disappointment.
With 155 horsepower and 160 foot-pounds of torque, this little
sport ute should zip right along. But the test car, with a
four-speed automatic transmission, had only adequate acceleration,
at best.
</P>
<P>
   On long uphill grades or highway cruising above 70 miles an
hour, it seemed to run out of steam. Buyers seeking acceleration
should try the five-speed manual transmission. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While wind noise was not a factor on the highway, the short
wheelbase and firm suspension combined for a choppy ride, which
worsened when four-wheel drive was engaged. Not as sophisticated or
convenient as the all-time, all-wheel systems of the CR-V or
Forester, the Grand Vitara compensates by offering a compound low
range for serious off-road work. In four-wheel-high range, a
binding in the system can be felt through the steering wheel when
performing sharp turns in parking lots. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eight-inch untracked snow on a mountain road was no obstacle for
the Vitara. Even with 16-inch 235/60R tires that had an aggressive
highway _ not off-road _ tread, there was little slippage or loss
of traction.
</P>
<P>
   While the Grand Vitara pampers front passengers, those in the
back don't fare as well. Even with 35.9 inches of rear leg room,
second in the class to the CR-V's 36.7 inches, it feels cramped.
Cargo space behind the rear seat is limited, but the split
seatbacks fold to provide a fair amount of carrying capacity.
</P>
<P>
   However, when the rear seats fold forward, they bump against the
backs of the front seats, substantially restricting those seats'
rearward adjustment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Vitara line starts at $16,000 and Grand Vitaras at $18,000.
Rear-drive versions are available. But demonstrating the
competitive difficulties that all the vehicles in this category
face, for about the same money you can have a much more spacious
four-door Jeep Cherokee with a 190-horsepower, six-cylinder engine.
</P>
<P>
   While the Suzuki is nicely equipped and fun to drive, its name
conjures up images of 50s Russian limousines shuttling Communist
functionaries in Romania. In contrast to the Sidekick, though, only
the name is a joke. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE TRACK: Looks good, but could use some Viagra under the
hood. &QL;

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
New York is even farther from Houston than Toronto, but at least
it's in the same country.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Half of Roger Clemens' reason for wanting to be traded was
satisfied when the Blue Jays sent the five-time Cy Young Award
winner to the Yankees in a deal that sent shock waves through
baseball when it was announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clemens made it clear he wanted to play in Houston,
where he would have been close to his wife, Debbie, and their four
sons, he also let it be known he wanted to land with a contender.
</P>
<P>
   He got perhaps the strongest contender of all, landing with the
World Series champion New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Mr. Steinbrenner knew I wanted to be a part of the
organization,'' Clemens said, referring to Yankees owner George
Steinbrenner. ``I know the tradition, and I love it. I love
pitching at Yankee Stadium; I love the monuments and all the stuff
that goes along with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about the opportunity to go there and play, and
I'm going to take full advantage of it. I can't wait to try on that
hat and the pinstripes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays acquired lefthanders David Wells and Graeme Lloyd
and second-base prospect Homer Bush. Blue Jays general manager Gord
Ash devoted most of his attention to the Yankees when it became
apparent he wasn't going to be able to pry pitcher Scott Elarton or
outfielder Richard Hidalgo from the Astros, who were considered the
front-runners in the Clemens sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave it every effort we could,'' Astros general manager
Gerry Hunsicker said. ``We've been at this regularly for almost two
months, and in the end it came down to the New York Yankees being
able to match up better with the Blue Jays than we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland and Texas also were in the running for Clemens, who
has won the American League's pitching triple crown (leading the
league in wins, ERA and strikeouts) in each of the past two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (the Yankees trade) did the most for us in terms of what
we wanted to accomplish,'' Ash said. ``We put three players on our
club for one _ even though the one is a premium guy. The other
deals (offered) were more future-orientated deals.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the deal was consummated late Wednesday, the Yankees
waited until Thursday to make it official because manager Joe Torre
wanted to inform the departing Yankees in person. When Torre called
Wells into his office, the pitcher said: ``First day of school, and
I'm already in the principal's office; what's up?''
</P>
<P>
   Wells, who pitched a perfect game last season, had no way of
knowing how much was up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little emotional right now,'' said Wells, who covered
his face with a cap to hide the tears. ``Give me a couple days;
it's a little tough right now.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes the trade so intriguing is that the Yankees seemingly
need Clemens less than any team that was competing for his
services. The Yankees set an American League record with 114 wins
in 1998 and raced through the postseason with an 11-2 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an easy choice to tinker with the success we had in
1998,'' Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said. ``We're a
proactive organization, and we're constantly looking to improve
things. We had an offer (from the Blue Jays) that made my knees
buckle. It's tough when you have a player the caliber of Roger
Clemens staring you in the face.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, who was 20-6 in 1998, has won 233 games in a 15-year
career, and the trade to the Yankees gives him a legitimate chance
to get back to the World Series for the first time since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees pursued Clemens after the 1996 season when the Red
Sox decided he was on the downside of his career and let him test
the free-agent waters. Clemens decided on Toronto and added his
fourth and fifth Cy Young Awards north of the border.
</P>
<P>
   Because the trade occurred while Clemens is in the midst of a
multiyear contract, he has the right to demand a trade at the end
of the season. For now, Clemens will play under the terms of his
existing contract, which calls for the righthander to make $16.1
million over the next two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But don't be surprised if the Yankees give him a lucrative
extension _ just as they did last season with second baseman Chuck
Knoblauch, who like Clemens is represented by Houston-based agents
Alan and Randy Hendricks.

<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ The first hint to most Yankees that Roger Clemens
was about to be their newest teammate came Thursday morning when
Joe Torre closed the clubhouse doors to the news media. Normally,
the Yankees allow reporters to enter at 8:30 a.m. This was
different. It was a day to etch into Yankee history.
</P>
<P>
   If the Yankees were looking for a startling way to get the
attention of a team that won 125 games and a World Series title
last season, they found it. They did so by obtaining a future Hall
of Fame pitcher who has won an unprecedented five American League
Cy Young Awards and is sure to have an immediate impact. His name
is Roger Clemens and, before one spring-training game, the best
team in baseball just got better.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a gamer, but he's more than just a pitcher,'' said George
Steinbrenner. ``He's a true legend. I love his work ethic. I love
athletes that train like he does. How can you not like Roger
Clemens? It's like saying I don't like chocolate ice cream.''
</P>
<P>
   So that is why the Yankees were giddy Thursday at the thought of
having the intense 36-year old to give their team an unnecessary
yet more than welcome boost. The trade made David Wells and the
rest of the American League East weep.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is we got an unbelievable talent and Hall of
Famer,'' said General Manager Brian Cashman. ``Everybody knows what
he can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, who turned down an opportunity to sign a free-agent
contract with the Yankees after the 1996 season, was thrilled to
get another chance to play for a team that he feels can help him
secure an elusive World Series ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking to my mother last night and she said that I
always talked about the Yankees when I was little,'' Clemens said.
``I guess it's come full circle.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, who was such a dominating pitcher with the Boston Red
Sox and who continued antagonizing the Yankees in his two seasons
with the Jays, is now in pinstripes. It is a vision that will be
almost incomprehensible for diehard Boston fans and delightful for
ardent Yankee fans.
</P>
<P>
   But Clemens might also have to mend some wounds with a few
Yankees he has plunked with pitches, especially Scott Brosius and
Derek Jeter. The right-hander was involved in two bean-ball
encounters with Hideki Irabu last year and was one of the most
disliked pitchers in their clubhouse. Clemens nailed Jeter in the
side after Irabu hit Alex Gonzalez in a spring-training game and
drilled Brosius in the back during a game in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a competitive person,'' said Clemens. ``I hope they know
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Personal feelings aside, most of the Yankees realized that
obtaining Clemens pushed them closer to winning another World
Series. Paul O'Neill was relieved that Clemens, who has worn number
21 throughout his 15-year career, said that he will probably wear
12, Wade Boggs' old number, with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it's not an issue,'' said O'Neill. ``I've worn it my
whole career, so I hope it's left like that. It would be difficult
for me to change. If we win another World Series, we can both
high-five over it. Or high-21, I guess.'' &QL;

FISHER RETURNS TO FORM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Derek Fisher can't control the minutes or which
quarters he plays, so he's focusing now on the only thing he can
control: his own attitude.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Lakers' starting point guard admits his
confidence took a blow when coach Del Harris told him, 24 hours
before opening night, that backup Derek Harper would handle fourth
quarters and that Fisher might play fewer minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't sit here and say that it didn't (affect me),'' Fisher
said. ``It not only threw me off, but it really disappointed me,
because we hadn't even played a game yet, so I hadn't proven that I
could do the job in the fourth quarter. You don't want to be a
leader but not be able to lead.''
</P>
<P>
   His confidence down, his minutes limited to those of a reserve,
Fisher struggled in the Lakers' first six games, averaging 3.6
points and 3.0 assists. But Fisher is beginning to again resemble
the point guard of last March, when he excelled in place of the
injured Nick Van Exel.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher played well late in the Indiana game Sunday and after a
horrible first few minutes against Dallas on Wednesday, played his
best game of the season, posting 12 points, six assists and five
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically I just said forget it, for lack of a better word.
I'm tired of playing these mind games with myself,'' he said. ``I'm
accepting the situation. I don't like it, it's not where I wanted
to be or wished that I could be. But I'm dealing with it, the best
way I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Horry update: Robert Horry, who has missed three games because
of an irregular heartbeat, will miss at least another four games as
doctors try to determine the cause.
</P>
<P>
   Horry continues to experience additional heartbeats, a condition
that surfaced Saturday, and tests Thursday failed to pinpoint the
cause, though doctors believe it may be related to his recent viral
infection.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the extra heartbeats continue, doctors are advising
that Horry not participate in any strenuous activity. Horry will
not travel on the three-game road trip that begins Sunday in
Seattle. He's scheduled to undergo further tests Monday in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Thursday's practice was little more than a
four-on-four half-court game, as six players treated a variety of
ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Knight is nursing a sprained left ankle and is
day-to-day. Rick Fox rested his sore right foot but will play
tonight. Rookie Ruben Patterson was sent home with an
upper-respiratory infection that has wound its way through the
roster.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Sam Jacobson broke his left ring finger in pregame
warmups Wednesday and was placed on the injured list. Rookie Tyronn
Lue (back spasms) is probably headed for the injured list when
teams reduce rosters from 14 to 12 today at 3 p.m. PST.
</P>
<P>
   With Horry also missing, coach Del Harris made the best of the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I thought we still had a productive practice with
just eight people,'' he said. ``The guys worked hard and it was not
a wasted day.''

<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ David Wells emerged from the elevator at Legends
Field Thursday after a final meeting with and a hug from George
Steinbrenner, a somber look on his thick face and a softer quality
to his booming voice. The man who loved being a Yankee so much that
he once wore one of Babe Ruth's caps in a game had been informed
that he had been traded back to the Toronto Blue Jays. It hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Through gloomy eyes and by asking reporters to leave him alone,
Wells indicated how much anguish he was feeling after being forced
to shed his pinstripes. He did not bolt by a crowd of reporters.
Instead, he stopped in a doorway, stared at the group and politely
asked for some space. ``I'm a little emotional right now,'' Wells
said. ``Just give me a couple of days. It's a little tough to
take.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a stunning way for even the powerful and publicity-soaked
Yankees to open the first day of spring training, by getting Roger
Clemens from the Jays for Wells, Graeme Lloyd and Homer Bush. As he
walked to the players' parking lot, Wells, who has a remark for
everyone and everything, was basically speechless.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little emotional, you know?'' Wells said. ``Give me a
couple of days. Come over to the Blue Jays camp in a couple of days
and I'll talk to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Wells shrugged his shoulders and escaped into his white
Chevy Tahoe, ending a short and colorful two-year stint with the
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   He pitched a perfect game at Yankee Stadium, he helped the
Yankees snare a World Series title, he almost fought with the
68-year-old Steinbrenner in the clubhouse, he clashed with Manager
Joe Torre and he reveled in being the rebel on the gentlemanly
Yankees. If you liked Metallica, tattoos, Howard Stern and
post-game beers, you liked Wells. Steinbrenner, the Yankees'
principal owner, grew to adore him and abstained from casting an
initial vote on whether the Yankees should even make this deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a very emotional meeting and that's all I'm saying
because I like David a lot,'' said Steinbrenner, who did not
discount the possibility of someday bringing back Wells. ``My door
is always open to David.''
</P>
<P>
   David Cone, one of Wells' closest friends, said: ``He almost
became a cult hero overnight because of the perfect game. He made
his mark in Yankee history. He should be proud of that. It won't be
forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday is also a day that Wells will never forget. He was a
guest on the radio with Bubba the Love Sponge, Tampa's version of
Stern, as he drove to work, and the disk jockey asked him how his
first day of spring training had been. Wells, who did not work out
with a few Yankees on Wednesday, blurted out, ``I'll let you know
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, Wells strutted into the clubhouse and was quickly
ushered into Torre's office. That is where Torre and General
Manager Brian Cashman told him that he had been traded to a team
that released him in 1993. Wells' chin sank.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hugged me; he hugged Joe,'' Cashman said. ``He said, `Wow.
I know this is a business.' He said, `I hope you match me up with
Roger every time.'''
</P>
<P>
   After Thursday's trade, Wells, 35, and Clemens, 36, will be
forever linked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boomer was a gamer,'' Cone said. ``He came ready to pitch. In
that sense, he and Roger are very similar. The only way you could
trade a guy as popular as Boomer was for Roger Clemens. That's the
only trade that could have been made.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone, who entered the clubhouse as Wells was exiting it, nearly
bumped into him. The two stood in silence, with Cone occasionally
trying to console Wells.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked,'' Cone said. ``David and I were together for a
while and neither one of us knew what to say. He had his bags
packed and said, `I'll see you later.' I didn't know what to say.''
</P>
<P>
   That feeling was mutual. Some Yankees said Wells buzzed around
offering hasty hugs and quick good-byes, like a person who was
trying to catch a flight. They theorized that Wells was on the
verge of tears and that is why he departed so swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tough business,'' said Paul O'Neill, from his home
in Columbus, Ohio. ``I don't know exactly how to look at it. The
first thing I heard was that we got Clemens and I got excited. But
when I heard we gave up Boomer, I said, `Oh, no.' ''
</P>
<P>
   After Cone finished the Thursday workout, he left the complex to
visit Wells at the left-hander's home in Palm Harbor, Fla. Cone
knew that on this day and at this time Wells needed a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved being a Yankee,'' said Cone. ``He was so proud of
what he did. He was so proud of what we did last year. He and I
talked about how it could be a once-in-a-lifetime thing.''
</P>
<P>
   For Wells, apparently, it was. &QL;

 &HT;    GLOATING NEW HAMPSHIRE DEMOCRATS WELCOME 'COMEBACK KID'
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ President Clinton, searching for political
redemption in the wake of his impeachment acquittal, completed a
sentimental journey Thursday night through New Hampshire, the state
that saved his scandal-buffeted campaign for president in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   On the seventh anniversary of the primary battle in which he
once vowed that he would ``be there for you until the last dog
dies,'' a triumphant Clinton declared to the Democratic faithful at
a state party fundraiser that ``this dog is limping but still
going.''
</P>
<P>
   And looking ahead to the 2000 New Hampshire primary, Clinton
inched away from the tradition of presidential neutrality by giving
his vice president, Al Gore, what came close to an endorsement,
even though Gore will have at least one challenger, former Sen.
Bill Bradley of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the unprecedented economic growth that has occurred
during his presidency, Clinton teased, ``I want to say something
completely dry and academic, something completely factual, purely
historical, totally nonpolitical - nobody had more to do with the
decisions we've made and the success we've enjoyed than Vice
President Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   His remarks prompted hundreds in the crowd to hoist ``Gore
2000'' placards.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's arrival at the fundraiser, held in the National Guard
Armory to accommodate a larger-than-expected crowd, triggered a
lengthy spirited display of enthusiasm and affection for the
president. Clinton himself could not halt the applause and
cheering. Giving up, he gave the crowd his widely-parodied
thumbs-up gesture. Later, he flashed the ``V-for-victory'' sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not supposed to gloat, but I can't control this crowd,''
said State Democratic Party Chairman Jeff Woodburn. ``We do love
this president here in New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the Senate's acquittal of Clinton on the impeachment
charges brought by the House of Representatives, Clinton press
secretary Joe Lockhart had declared the White House a ``gloat-free
zone.''
</P>
<P>
   But it did not extend to New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a high gloat factor here tonight, but they're trying
to keep it under a bushel,'' said Kurt Ehrenberg of Rye, N.H.,
founder of a political Internet site, www.politicaljunkie.com.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, prior to Clinton's arrival, the more than 1,000
Democrats who paid $100 a ticket to attend the event milled about,
munching finger food and sipping wine. Some discussed the small
band of demonstrators outside who had waved signs that said ``Jail
to the Chief.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the strains of ``Hail to the Chief'' interrupted 60's
rock 'n ' roll that blared from the armory speaker system, the
crowd inside cheered wildly.
</P>
<P>
   A beaming Clinton began his remarks by reminiscing about how the
people of New Hampshire had thrown his campaign ``a lifeline'' in
1992 and how he had emerged from the experience with the nickname,
``the Comeback Kid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never forgotten the kindness, the thoughtfulness, the
humanity ... of the people of New Hampshire,'' he said. ``You took
us into your homes, you shared your struggles and your dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   It was during the 1992 New Hampshire primary that Clinton was
first hit with allegations of an extramarital affair with Gennifer
Flowers, that he had dodged the military draft during the Vietnam
War and that he had smoked marijuana while a student in England.
After sinking in the polls, Clinton finished a strong second to the
late Paul Tsongas, then went on to win the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had listened to the political experts, the dog would
have died,'' he said. ``But instead you held out a lifeline. You
decided that the election should go on ... You embraced our
cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton noted how different the state's economy is today in
comparison with 1992 when the national recession had left 7.3
percent unemployed. The state's current unemployment rate is 2.9
percent, the result of 77,500 new jobs since Clinton took office.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton said his economic policies had turned the
country around and turned a $290 billion deficit into a $70 billion
surplus, he cautioned his fellow Democrats against becoming
complacent. He said the next battle with Republicans is over using
the federal government's surplus to bolster Social Security and
Medicare and pay down the national debt instead of cutting taxes
across the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have a real policy debate with our friends in the
Republican Party,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the stage, Clinton confidently jabbed at the air and
lingered along the rope line, shaking hands before returning to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, in Dover, Clinton hosted a roundtable
discussion with Gov. Jeanne Shaheen and people whose health care
hardships illustrate what some of his budget proposals _
particularly a $1,000 tax credit for long-term care _ are designed
to remedy.
</P>
<P>
   He was greeted in Manchester with a newspaper headline: ``Mr.
President, you're a disgrace!'' The newspaper, the Union Leader,
also ran a frontpage editorial by publisher Nackey Loeb entitled
``Don't come back, kid.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's mood was clearly upbeat throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a real sentimental journey,'' said White House aide
Paul Begala, who was one of Clinton's top strategists in the 1992
campaign. ``It's good for his soul.''

EXCITEMENT LEVEL RISES AS NEW DODGERS ARRIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ They tracked in throughout the day. Darren
Dreifort. Then Eric Young. A little later Todd Hundley strolled in.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Brown is slated to arrive today, as are a handful of the
Dodgers and Dodgers-wannabes as pitchers, catchers and the walking
wounded voluntarily report for spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the most exciting team, coming into camp,
I've had a chance to be with,'' said Los Angeles Dodgers second
baseman Eric Young, eager to test the right foot he broke last
September. ``This is a different flavor (of players from last
season). I think there will be more intensity. We have some real
gamers in here, and I'm interested to see how it all meshes
together.''
</P>
<P>
   In case you've been asleep for the past five months, this club
is vastly different than the one that ended the 1998 season. The
acquisitions of Hundley, Brown and Devon White _ not to mention a
new manager in Davey Johnson and a new coaching staff _ have
proportionately changed the Dodgers' expectations-o-meter, a fact
easily sensed among those arriving here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this year it's going to be more business-like,'' Young
said. ``We're going to have our fun, but when we're out (on the
field) I think it will be business-like. I think drills will be
done the way they should be done, and we'll be finished with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus, we have a lot of golfers with us, so they want to do the
work right and then go play golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and with Hundley's arrival also begins the incessant
questioning sure to follow him for the next six to eight months.
It's about his reconstructed right elbow and its health.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley has no problem with it, partly because he's spent the
past month working out in Florida. He said he's been throwing full
force and experienced no pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's why I've been down here for a month, because I had the
same questions in my mind, and I wanted to resolve those
questions,'' Hundley said. ``I've experienced nothing that would
send a red flag up.''
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Charlie Strasser said there were no surprise injuries,
inflammations or infections from the 15 or so Dodgers who reported
Wednesday, which could be the only thing that keeps the Dodgers out
of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know what's going to happen,'' Dodgers general
manager Kevin Malone said. ``I pray every day we stay healthy.''

 &HT;    Jasper jury hears of rite to 'spill blood' for gang
 &HT;    By Denise Gamino
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ White prison gangs call it ``taking a black
out,'' an initiation rite that requires a member to ``spill blood
to get in and give blood to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   While in prison John William ``Bill'' King _ charged with the
horrific dragging death of James Byrd Jr. _ spoke of his plans to
find a black man and ``kidnap him maybe, put him in the trunk of a
car, take him out in the woods ... kill him,'' a jury was told
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get in you have to get a blood tie,'' ex-convict William
Matthew Hoover said of white supremacy prison gangs. ``To help new
recruits get initiated, take somebody out and kill them.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoover, now a college student in Missouri, was a prison friend
of King, 24, who is on trial here for the June 7 murder of Byrd.
</P>
<P>
   Hoover served time for robbery at the Beto One Unit near
Palestine when he met King, and was the state's star witness on
Thursday, the third day of testimony. His white supremacy tattoos
covered by a long-sleeved shirt, Hoover said he was testifying
reluctantly because the court appearance could endanger his life.
</P>
<P>
   Hoover belonged to the white-supremacy Aryan Brotherhood while
in prison. King, serving a sentence for burglary, belonged to the
Confederate Knights of America.
</P>
<P>
   He said King spoke of ``taking a black man out'' and explained
to the jury that white gangs required incoming members to ``spill
blood.''
</P>
<P>
   King and two other white men allegedly drove Byrd to a remote
road near this lumber town, beat him, chained him to a pickup and
dragged him nearly three miles until his body broke apart.
</P>
<P>
   That deadly chain was brought to the courtroom late Thursday,
sending shivers through Byrd's family sitting in the front two
rows.
</P>
<P>
   The rusty logging chain was stretched to its full 24-and-a-half
feet in front of the jury by an FBI agent and a prosecutor who
pulled it out of a sealed box.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was chilling,'' said Clara Taylor, one of Byrd's six
sisters. ``I think we thought we were mentally prepared for
everything that's come into this case. But to see that chain was
bone-chilling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me think back to the slaves of slavery when you saw
black men chained and brought over on ships,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another sister, Mylinda Washington, said, ``I did everything I
can to sit there, really. It brought everything into perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``You kind of imagined what he went through,'' she said. ``It
was horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators found the chain buried in a hole behind the home
of one of King's friends the day after Byrd's killing. The chain
had been taken to a local car wash and cleaned of any blood or
flesh, said Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors have told the jury they have found other items
that link King and the two other men _ Shawn Allen Berry, 24; and
Lawrence Russell Brewer, 31 _ to the scene of Byrd's death. The
items include cigarette butts, beer bottles, watches, a cigarette
lighter engraved with King's nickname, ``Possum,'' and Byrd's blood
on the shoes of the three white men.
</P>
<P>
   The jury of 11 whites and one black is expected to begin
deliberations sometime next week. King faces the death penalty if
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   King claims he is innocent, and his defense attorneys on
Thursday tried to show that his numerous white supremacy tattoos
were a shield of protection in prison for a small white man who may
otherwise be vulnerable to attacks. Some of the tattoos may have
multiple meanings, his lawyers argue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the eye of the beholder,'' said defense attorney Brack
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Jones and fellow defense attorney C. Haden ``Sonny'' Cribbs Jr.
argue that King's prison experience changed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``His attitude changed in the penitentiary,'' Jones told
reporters after court recessed. ``And the tattoos were put on in
the penitentiary.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray, the prosecutor, said King's prison experience, even if
life-changing, was not a mitigating factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I want to do is prove he was bad, he's racist and did it
and is going to do other things in the future,'' he said.

<P>
   The Yankees and the Toronto Blue Jays made a trade Thursday that
had nothing to do with the Boston Red Sox but had everything to do
with their fans.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the feelings of the downtrodden Red Sox fans. They were
already preparing for a season without their beloved Mo Vaughn,
knowing it would be a lost season, a wasteland of a season, but
doggedly ready to tender their support nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Roger Clemens trade has added sadism to their masochism.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Red Sox let Vaughn leave as a free agent this
winter, they jettisoned Clemens two years ago, pronouncing him an
aging pitcher no longer worth the money or years he sought as a
free agent. Two Cy Young awards later, the Red Sox fans have to
face the agony of watching their onetime hero pitch for the hated
Yankees and help the Yankees get where the Red Sox can't.
</P>
<P>
   April is the cruelest month? Try May, June, July, August,
September and October, too.
</P>
<P>
   Don Zimmer, the Yankees' bench coach, devilishly planned to add
a few grains of salt to the gaping psychic wounds. When the Yankees
play at Fenway Park in May and Clemens is the starting pitcher in
one of the three games, Zimmer, who is notorious in Boston as the
manager who squandered a 14-game lead over the Yankees in 1978,
plans to take the lineup card to home plate.
</P>
<P>
   It was bad enough when Wade Boggs returned to Fenway the first
time in a Yankee uniform in 1993. Clemens' appearance in the
Yankees' gray road uniform will be cause for emotional despair for
Red Sox fans.
</P>
<P>
   Their feelings aside, this is a trade that is good for both
teams. The Blue Jays shed a player who insulted them by asking out
because, Clemens said, they weren't a contender even though they
made a legitimate run at the wild-card spot and seemed to improve
each day of the last seven weeks of the season. In return, they
received a solid starting pitcher in Wells.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees gain because Clemens is becoming the next Nolan
Ryan, a hard-throwing ageless winner and Wells was not likely to
match the best year of his life. The Yankees didn't need Clemens to
repeat as division champions, but with their lineup behind him, he
should finally look formidable in his post-season performances.
</P>
<P>
   Change seems to go well with Clemens. In the few seasons before
he was forced out of Boston, he did not resemble the pitcher who
had won three Cy Young awards. But he seemed to use the insult the
Red Sox inflicted to work harder and push himself more fiercely,
and two outstanding seasons ensued.
</P>
<P>
   Now he has another motivation; proving that the two seasons in
Toronto were not the brightening of the light bulb before it burns
out. Not to mention pitching for the best team in baseball at the
hallowed grounds of the legendary ball park and before the fans who
reviled him when he pitched for the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens could have been here before this. George Steinbrenner
tried diligently to lure him to the Yankees two years ago. At the
time, the Indians tried valiantly to get him to Cleveland. Clemens,
as a free agent, said his goal was to play in the World Series. The
Yankees and the Indians offered him the best opportunity to
accomplish that goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays were the third team in the chase. On a downward
slide from the caliber of their 1992-93 World Series championship
teams, they were the least likely to reach the World Series. But
desperate to induce Clemens to play in Toronto, the Blue Jays
violated baseball rules by including an unreported side agreement
that gave Clemens the right to request a trade and the additional
right to approve the team to which he could be traded.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens invoked the agreement last December, saying he wanted to
(1) play for a contender, or (2) play closer to home. But when he
asked the team closest to home, the Houston Astros, who also
happened to be a contender, for what amounted to $27.4 million for
one extra year on his contract, it became evident that his trade
request was all about money.
</P>
<P>
   He saw what the market had become for front-line pitchers, $12.5
million a year and up. He didn't want to have to wait two more
years until his contract would expire. ``It's all about the
money,'' a Blue Jays executive said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees say no contract adjustment _ renegotiation or
extension _ has been discussed with Clemens and his agents. The
agents, the Hendricks brothers of Houston, know Steinbrenner. They
didn't even need a wink from George to approve the trade.

CY YOUNG INCARNATE,   BUT WITH QUESTIONS   AND A PRICKLY PAST

<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Roger Clemens might win 300 games before he
retires, he could become only the third pitcher to compile 4,000
strikeouts. With at least five Cy Young Awards to his credit, he
will be elected into baseball's Hall of Fame after retiring.
</P>
<P>
   But Clemens has never been part of a team that won a World
Series, and like the slugger Ted Williams, he is dogged by the
label _ probably an unfair one _ that he cannot succeed in a big
game. Clemens has won one of nine starts in the post-season. John
McNamara, who managed Clemens with the Boston Red Sox, always has
maintained that Clemens begged out of Game 6 of the 1986 World
Series, which the Mets eventually won when a ground ball went
through Bill Buckner's legs; Clemens has said he was ill.
</P>
<P>
   Following the blockbuster trade late Wednesday night that sent
Clemens to the Yankees for the All-Star David Wells, the middle
reliever Graeme Lloyd and the utilityman Homer Bush, Clemens has a
chance to change that perception. He joins a team that won 114
games in the regular season and swept the World Series last year, a
team now the favorite to win the World Series again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is now I'm going to a team that is already
champions,'' Clemens said Thursday from his home in Texas. ``I just
want to slide in the side door and go to work with these guys.
Hopefully I'll fit right in.''
</P>
<P>
   He becomes the ace of a rotation that includes David Cone, Andy
Pettitte, Orlando Hernandez and Hideki Irabu. The Yankees always
have stacked their rotation with left-handers to exploit the
dimensions of Yankee Stadium, and now Pettitte is the only lefty
among four right-handers who will pitch in a home park best suited
for left-handers.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees saw this as an insignificant factor. Clemens can
dominate left-handed and right-handed batters, and he will provide
his unique presence. When Yankees Manager Joe Torre sees Clemens,
he sees Bob Gibson, Sandy Koufax, Nolan Ryan _ the sort of pitcher
who attacks and intimidates hitters with his fastball. ``He's not
comfortable to bat against,'' Yankees catcher Joe Girardi said
dryly.
</P>
<P>
   Many opponents could offer horror stories about Clemens. Roberto
Alomar believes Clemens has thrown at him purposefully, with intent
to injure _ Clemens has thrown fastballs just behind Alomar's head,
flipping him onto his back.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens faced the Mets in Shea Stadium in 1997, and reached
second base. Trying to tire him, the Mets ran successive pick-off
plays, forcing him to lunge back into the base. Clemens, sweat
streaming down his face, realized what was happening, turned and
pointed at Rey Ordonez, the Mets' shortstop. ``You do that again,''
Clemens said, ``and I'm going to hit you in the head.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Baltimore Orioles maintain Clemens aims at the
center fielder Brady Anderson for sport, raising one or two ugly
black welts with the imprint of baseball stitching in the middle of
his back each year. Chuck Knoblauch, the Yankees' second baseman,
is represented by the same agents as Clemens, and like Clemens grew
up in the Houston area. But Clemens routinely hit him, perhaps to
make sure that Knoblauch doesn't get special treatment, or because
Knoblauch attended Texas A&AMP;M, an archrival of Clemens' alma mater,
the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Girardi once asked the umpire to check the baseball when he was
facing Clemens, and Clemens responded by staring him down. The
Yankees believe that Clemens threw intentionally at Derek Jeter and
Scott Brosius last season. ``I've plunked a lot of guys in my
career,'' Clemens said. ``I've had a lot of balls hit off my shins.
I'm a competitive person. I hope they know that.''
</P>
<P>
   They do. Clemens has always competed this way since the Red Sox
picked him in the first round of the 1984 draft. He averaged nearly
20 victories per season from 1986-1992, once striking out a record
20 against the Seattle Mariners. There were stories of his
intensity and toughness: Once, when he had strained a groin muscle,
he would return to his home in Framingham, Mass., after games and
strenuously walk hills for 90 minutes to rehabilitate his injury.
He began keeping notes on the strengths and weaknesses of opposing
hitters _ and on umpires as well.
</P>
<P>
   Arm and back trouble hampered him, however, and he had a record
of 40-39 from 1993-96. One team that considered signing him as a
free agent examined his medical records and estimated that he would
break down for good within three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But Clemens re-dedicated himself to his conditioning and
rebounded, his pitching style evolving. Clemens will now get ahead
with his fastball of 96 to 97 miles an hour, throwing sinking and
sailing strikes to the inside and outside corners; with the
ball-strike count in his favor, he will throw his split-fingered
fastball, its movement electric, diving and darting, and hitters
will chase it.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens has 233 victories. He won 21 games for the Blue Jays in
1997, leading the league in victories, earned run average (2.05)
and strikeouts (292), and once again, he whiffed 20 batters in one
game (with no walks) against Detroit. In 1998, when Clemens again
led the league in victories (20), earned run average (2.65) and
strikeouts (271), he became the fourth pitcher in history to do so,
joining Sandy Koufax (1965-66), Lefty Grove (1930-31) and Grover
Cleveland Alexander (1915-16).
</P>
<P>
   Clemens is a throwback in his pitching style, in how he knocks
down hitters, in how he uses his fastball to intimidate. But he is
thoroughly modern in his expectations of how he wants to be
treated. Clemens warred with the Boston front office at the end of
his tenure with the Red Sox, and when he signed with Toronto, he
asked for clauses that would allow him to dictate his future.
</P>
<P>
   Before last season, Clemens used his star power to aid in the
hiring of Tim Johnson as the manager of the Blue Jays, and he was
instrumental in Toronto's signing of Jose Canseco. After the
season, when Clemens asked Toronto to trade him and suggested the
Blue Jays wouldn't remain competitive in 1999, many baseball
officials believed he was merely trying to position himself to
renegotiate his contract.
</P>
<P>
   None of that, however, has diminished the respect for him as a
pitcher. When Paul O'Neill heard last fall that the Yankees had a
chance to get Clemens, he encouraged Yankees General Manager Brian
Cashman to make the deal. ``He might add a lot of fuel to the
fire,'' O'Neill said. ``Who knows, he's a dominating pitcher. He
always pitches well. I hope he takes off like he has for the last
10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone said, ``They could've thrown me into the deal and it
would've been a good trade.` &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the last couple of seasons, David Wells, the
Yankee southpaw, had fascinated, perplexed and melted legions of
New Yorkers with his lunchpail approach to the game and his
warts-and-all, Everyman personality. Sure, he had flaws. But he
gave his all. He said what he felt. He had come to epitomize,
people liked to say, a regular New York guy.
</P>
<P>
   So Thursday, when Wells was shipped to the Toronto Blue Jays as
part of a trade for the perennial Cy Young award winner Roger
Clemens, many fans in New York expressed shock and sadness, as if
the cold reality of baseball the business had ripped the soul out
of a joyous thing called baseball the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone thought it was awful,'' said Joel Kamins, 24, who
works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. ``Everybody was
wailing. I don't think anyone thought it was a good trade.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, the Yankees had a good _ no, a great _ thing going
last year, when they relied on chemistry and a well-balanced attack
to stake their claim as the best baseball team in history. The only
question, it seemed, going into the 1999 campaign, was not whether
the Yankees would repeat, but how many more records they would
obliterate.
</P>
<P>
   So, why, many people asked, should George Steinbrenner, the team
owner, tinker with a smashingly successful formula? Why add a
supernova of a player who, his recent seasons in Canada
notwithstanding, is still viewed in some quarters as the ambassador
of the evil Boston Red Sox?
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to loyalty?'' said an exasperated David Lerner,
45, a publicist who lives in New Rochelle, N.Y., and has been
bleeding Yankee pinstripes since infancy. ``I don't want Roger
Clemens; he's a Red Sock. I mean, I wouldn't have traded Joe
DiMaggio for Ted Williams.''
</P>
<P>
   Some were so incredulous, they were almost suspicious that
something larger, something more sinister, was at work.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Sussman, an equity research analyst at an asset management
firm in midtown Manhattan, said it seemed rather unfair that the
bluest of New York's blue-collar athletes had recently left their
teams, or been traded to a team in Canada. First, it was Mark
Messier, the heart of the Rangers, who decided to sign with the
Vancouver Canucks after being offended by the Rangers' contract
offer. Then, Charles Oakley, the Knicks' enforcer, was
unceremoniously dealt to Toronto. Now Wells.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, once the passions cooled, once the shrill barking on talk
radio abated, many Yankee fans did concede that from a purely
baseball perspective, the trade _ which also sent reliever Graeme
Lloyd and infielder Homer Bush to the Blue Jays _ was not an
illogical one.
</P>
<P>
   For all of Wells' merits, 1998 was a career season for him _ an
18-4 record, a perfect game, a steely performance during the
playoffs. Just a few years ago, he was a sub-.500 pitcher with an
earned run average over 5.00. Clemens, on the other hand, is a
shoo-in for the Hall of Fame, a five-time Cy Young winner. He is
perhaps the best pitcher in the game. He still has the burning
desire to win a World Series championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really didn't need Clemens,'' said Sonny DeForte, 35, who
was sitting at the Ear In Tavern in Greenwich Village. ``But on
paper, the Yankees are a lot stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells and his teammates were often hailed as throwbacks to an
era when players sacrificed ego for victory, when players genuinely
seemed to play for fun and not for the money. Wells soaked up the
tradition, the comparisons to the great Yankee teams of lore: he
revered Babe Ruth, for instance, and even paid $35,000 for one of
Ruth's caps.
</P>
<P>
   Off the field, Wells inspired Ruthian comparisons as well. He
bankrolled Dionysian pleasures and was a straight shooter, too,
eagerly spilling information about his fondness for strip clubs,
Harley-Davidsons, tattoos and beer.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, Scott Wild, a senior copy writer for Leagas
Delaney, an advertising agency, described the trade as depressing.
That is because he helped create the wildly popular ANSKY campaign
for Adidas, in which five die-hard Yankee fans display their
loyalties on their bare, Wellsian midsections.
</P>
<P>
   Wells was not the inspiration for that campaign _ though ``if he
wasn't such a great pitcher, he'd be the guy in the stands
screaming,'' Wild said. Instead, Wells would most likely have
played a major part in a future campaign.
</P>
<P>
   One idea, Wild said, would have featured five Yankee fans in a
tattoo parlor, holding up a picture of Boomer, getting the word
WELLS emblazoned across their chests and blurting out, ``Boomer is
going to love it!''
</P>
<P>
   The ad's tag line would have read, ``Only in New York.'' But not
anymore.  &QL;

 &HT;    Morehouse turnovers cost them game, McAfee's No. 500 win
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After the failings of his team on its homecourt
Thursday night, Morehouse coach Arthur McAfee will have to continue
his pursuit of career-victory No. 500 on the road Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In a game against nationally ranked Lemoyne Owen, Morehouse
pushed the battle into overtime, before losing 77-75 as a result of
two critical turnovers inside the last two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our players were aware (of McAfee's quest), but still didn't
play well,'' said LeMoyne Owen coach Jerry Johnson, who, with 752
victories to his credit, happens to be the winningest active in the
NCAA Division II ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Morehouse (12-12, 7-9), down 70-66 with 1:37 left in regulation
play, managed to send the game into overtime after forward Justin
Miller scored four of his 20 second-half points.
</P>
<P>
   But in the overtime period, the Maroon Tigers threw the ball
away twice, which eventually prove to be their undoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Number 500 will come sometimes soon or later, but what teed me
off is that we gave this game away,'' said a fuming McAfee.
``Everybody out there wanted to be the star. They were trying to do
what they wanted to do, not what the coach wanted them to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Out-rebounding its opponent early, Morehouse, which got 22
points from Miller and 19 from forward Kenneth Smith, took a 29-22
lead on a layup by center James Teague with 8:53 left in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   But by intermission, No. 6-ranked LeMoyne Owen (21-2), which
snapped a two-game losing streak, had closed the gap to 35-34.
</P>
<P>
   The team from Memphis, which features one of the top 3-point
shooters in Division II, senior guard Antonio Harris, did not lead
in the game until guard Michael Bell made a layup to put his team
ahead 62-61 with 7:01 left.
</P>
<P>
   Thereafter, Harris, who has averaged five 3-point field goals a
game, scored on two layups after hitting on 7 attempts from 3-point
range and finishing the night with a game-high 25 points.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared the Maroon Tigers were done in regulation play,
before Miller responded with those four points inside the last
minute and a half.
</P>
<P>
   ``But (in the overtime period) our guys didn't want to listen to
the coach, and it cost us the ballgame,'' McAfee said.
</P>
<P>
   Morehouse will face Stillman College in Tuscaloosa, Ala.,
Saturday night.

<P>
   But what about the Babe Ruth cap? What about the perfect game on
Beanie Baby Day? What about the parade? Is this some kind of
prejudice thing against fat guys with gout?
</P>
<P>
   What, they want to win 126 games this time around? One hundred
and twenty-five wasn't good enough for them?
</P>
<P>
   Here the Yankees had a guy who was more ornery than any bicycle
messenger who ever ran you down on a New York sidewalk. Here they
had a guy who was more quirky than your last waiter in a Seventh
Avenue deli.
</P>
<P>
   Here they had a guy who reveled in the push and shove of New
York, and then went out and helped pitch them to a world
championship, and what did they do? They traded his big butt to
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   For what? Merely for Roger Clemens, the Cy Young winner for the
last two seasons, one of the best pitchers of this generation. Did
they need to do that? Where's George Steinbrenner's sense of humor?
</P>
<P>
   David Wells had the gall to waddle out to the mound one day,
when nobody was looking, wearing a cap that Babe Ruth himself had
actually worn on his mischievous head. After the inning was over,
they had to tell him, ``Uh, Boomer, that's not a regulation ball
cap, and you can't wear it.''
</P>
<P>
   Regulations. As the Boomer said when he knocked down Junior
Griffey, ``If they can't take a joke, the heck with 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody gets lachrymose about the lack of continuity in sports
these days, but the Yankees had a shot at presenting retro baseball
_ familiar faces, minus Tim Raines, a whiff of the stable 50s in
the last year of the precarious 90s.
</P>
<P>
   Owners whine about disloyal players always looking for the quick
fix _ oh, something like Roger Clemens wanting out of Toronto
because the Blue Jays were not competitive, in his opinion. Then he
blasted the management of the Astros for not ponying up the massive
money that would enable him to live at home in Houston. Now this
prototypical carpetbagger joins a team that won 125 games without
him, and David Wells is sent packing. See you later. Lotsa luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boomer is Boomer.'' That's what Joe Torre used to say when
Wells did some vaguely confrontational or erratic thing.
</P>
<P>
   Torre was not enamored with Wells because the guy was like some
big frisky pooch who never quite took to obedience lessons. Turn
your back on Boomer and he might be gnawing on a shoe or shedding
on the best sofa, but if you fell through the ice or got locked in
the basement, Boomer would run for help.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were a bit nervous because Boomer had concentration
problems and sometimes glowered at a fielder who made an honest
mistake. But last year he really worked on it because he knew Torre
was into tranquillity.
</P>
<P>
   And shades of the early Babe, Wells had one electric left arm
that made the ball break right through the strike zone. They won
the World Series with Boomer, and then he put on his shades and
rode up Broadway. Now they traded him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost a lot of character today,'' David Cone said. ``There
are probably a few establishments in Manhattan that will be down in
the dumps today when they hear the news. There may be some bars
going out of the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone, who has almost totally sublimated his personal inner
madman, regarded Boomer with about 50 percent raw admiration and 50
percent incredulity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He almost became a cult hero overnight,'' Cone said. ``He made
his mark in Yankee history, and not many people can say that.''
</P>
<P>
   The trade makes sense if you whip out the Handy-Dandy Catalog of
Theoretically Comparative Standards of Pitching Ability. A great
pitcher of 36 who keeps himself in great shape vs. a late bloomer
of 35 who might quaff the odd yard of ale between starts.
</P>
<P>
   But you know what? From a bad-vibes point of view, it is the
mound version of the Mets' tossing Tim McCarver out on his
enlightened jawbone.
</P>
<P>
   This Babe Ruth thing works both ways. The Boomer wanted to wear
No. 3 in the striped uniform, and the Yankees had to break it to
him slowly that they had long since retired his idol's number.
Yesterday I heard speculation about the awful humiliation the Red
Sox will face when the Yankees thunder into Fenway with Rocket
Roger, but that is not the operative hex anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have discarded their motorcycle man who thrived in
this challenging little center of the universe. They have messed
with Mother Nature. Forget about the Curse of the Bambino. In the
next century the Yankees just may have to confront the Curse of the
Boomer.

A CRUSHER: NETS FALL IN OVERTIME TO ROCKETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Favorable treatment for superstars
seemed to be the officials' rule Thursday night at the Continental
Arena, and New Jersey Nets center Jayson Williams found out that,
for all his popularity and charisma, he is not in that elite
company.
</P>
<P>
   Two questionable calls in the final six seconds of overtime
helped the Houston Rockets edge the Nets by 93-92 before 18,469
fans, nearly all of whom left the arena angry.
</P>
<P>
   First, with the score tied at 92-92, Kerry Kittles drove
baseline for a contested layup attempt that bounced around the rim
before Williams slammed it through with 6.6 seconds remaining for
what appeared to be the game-winning basket. But referee Scott
Foster called Williams for basket interference, causing an uproar
from the Nets and the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the night's final indignity for coach John Calipari and
his team, Scott Burrell was called for a foul by official Marc
Davis after inadvertently tangling feet with Scottie Pippen as both
players went for a pass with 3.3 seconds left. When Pippen sank one
of two foul shots, the Nets had one last chance of winning a game
they had led for all but the final minutes of the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Their execution faltering, Van Horn (18 points) got off a weak
midrange jumper that was deflected by Othella Harrington. The
strange turn of events dropped the Nets to 2-5, while Houston,
playing its third game in three nights, rose to 6-2.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The wildness started after rookie Michael Dickerson gave the
Rockets their first lead of the game at 75-74. For most of the
final seven minutes, Pippen and Gill were the main characters,
seemingly exchanging baskets every time down the floor. Pippen
scored 11 of his game-high 26 in the fourth, Gill 8 of his 24.
</P>
<P>
   The two straight baskets by Gill, who fouled out in overtime,
gave the Nets an 84-83 lead, Eric Murdock made one of two free
throws to push the lead to 2 points with 12.8 seconds left. After a
timeout, the Rockets looked for Pippen but with Gill shadowing him,
had to settle for Hakeem Olajuwon, the future Hall of Famer who had
scored only 4 points in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Calipari had inserted the shot-blocking specialist Jim McIlvaine
into the game for just that reason, but Olajuwon (21 points, 15
rebounds) had no problem hitting a 17 footer over the Net reserve's
outstretched arms with 4.4 seconds remaining. The Nets' execution
went awry in the final moments, forcing Keith Van Horn to launch a
3-pointer that was blocked by Pippen. Overtime ensued.
</P>
<P>
   Such a close finish did not appear likely with the Nets
controlling the first half and leading by 48-41 at the break. But
Houston scored the first six points of the second half to pull
within 48-47. Kerry Kittles put the Nets on his thin shoulders,
going on a 9-3 run by himself.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting four straight Nets baskets, including a 3-pointer, he
pushed the lead to six midway through the third. The Rockets
rallied behind 6 points by Pippen in the period to tie it at 63-63,
and then Gill took over, hitting a 17 footer and stealing Pippen's
dribble at half court to get Chris Gatling a layup.
</P>
<P>
   With a minute left in the quarter, Gill hit another jumper to
give the Nets a 69-63 lead. An 8-2 run by the Rockets at the start
of the fourth tied it at 71-71 and led to the series of late lead
changes.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets were playing their sixth straight game without Sam
Cassell on Thursday night. Though a magnetic resonance imaging test
today showed no fractures or ligament damage in his sprained right
ankle, it might be a good thing that the Nets are learning to play
without their starting point guard. Before the game, Calipari said
he could not predict when Cassell will return, but insisted that he
will not put him on the injured list.
</P>
<P>
   The weary Rockets, playing their third consecutive game, were
without Charles Barkley, the loquacious all-star who was off to a
sensational start _ averaging team-highs of 19.2 points and 17
rebounds through the first five games _ before undergoing surgery
on his left knee Feb. 14. He will be out for three to four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But neither the Rockets' fatigue nor injuries took away from the
Nets' performance, particularly in the first half. Executing with
precision in the halfcourt, hitting open jump shots and playing
excellent defense, the Nets turned in their best half of the season
in taking a 48-41 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest sign of the Nets' smooth offense was their balanced
scoring. Nine players scored before halftime, including four with 8
or more points. Gill was outstanding on both ends, scoring 10
points and hounding Scottie Pippen like few players do while making
three steals.
</P>
<P>
   A minute before the intermission, the Nets received a scare when
Gill dropped to the floor and gripped his left ankle after cutting
off Pippen's path to the basket. Fortunately for the Nets, it was
only a slight turn, and Gill started the second half.

KNICKS CAN'T STAY WITH CAVALIERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The Knicks played as if their four-game winning
streak was just a mirage as their prickly defense and menacing
presence around the basket disappeared into the dreary night.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Cavaliers frustrated the Knicks by beating them at
their own aggressive game. They ran, crashed and scored with ease
against the league's best defense, leading by as many as 33 points
in the fourth quarter, on their way to a 98-74 humiliation of the
Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   It was easy to see how this happened. The Cavaliers shot 33 free
throws while the suddenly passive Knicks went to the line only 12
times. Shawn Kemp _ who was surprisingly fleet _ twisted and turned
inside on every Knick who took a futile attempt at stopping him.
Kemp ended the game 5 of 8 from the field and 10 for 10 from the
free-throw line.
</P>
<P>
   As a reply, the Knicks shot 36 percent. If Dennis Scott (2 for
10) was not missing everything, Allan Houston (5 of 14) was burying
the team. Only Patrick Ewing (14 points, 7 of 17) was displaying a
game remotely familiar to the one that led the Knicks on a hollow
four-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Victories against the Bulls, the sliding Pistons, Raptors and
Wizards were not enough to prepare them for a Cavalier team now on
a four-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks faced a Cavaliers team without its budding star,
center Zydrunas Ilgauskas, who is out for the season. After
Ilgauskas was found Wednesday to have a fractured bone in his foot,
Coach Mike Fratello had to go small and use forward Vitaly
Potapenko against Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone will have to just try to come up with more
productivity to make up for the shots, rebounding and shot blocking
and whatever you lose with someone like Zydrunas out,'' Fratello
said before the game. ``It's similar to what the Knicks went
through last year when they lost Patrick.''
</P>
<P>
   In similar fashion, the Cavaliers came out in a sprint. They
raced up and down the floor and beat the Knicks in transition
throughout the game.
</P>
<P>
   Kemp may have been 40 pounds overweight after the National
Basketball Association's lockout, but he was lighter on his feet
than any Knick on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   As the third quarter neared an end, the Cavaliers were riding
Kemp all the way to a 17-point lead. Kurt Thomas, Marcus Camby and
Larry Johnson each took a turn, but no one could contend with
Kemp's presence in the post.
</P>
<P>
   The Cavaliers were also getting some help with nifty drives from
forward Cedric Henderson and a couple of silky 3-pointers by guard
Wesley Person. On one drive to the basket, Kemp kicked the ball out
to Person, who hit a 3-pointer to provide a 17-point lead with
under a minute left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   As smoothly as the Cavalier starters were playing, Fratello had
little bench support this game. With his second unit in, the Knicks
built a couple of small, short-lived leads. Once Person and
Henderson _ who beat Houston down the floor twice _ came back in to
join Kemp and Potapenko, the Cavaliers ended the first half on a
10-0 run and took a 43-36 lead at the half.
</P>
<P>
   That edge was gained by aggression. The Cavaliers either drove
inside or dumped the ball in to Kemp at every opportunity while the
Knicks were settling for jumpers. The result was a stunning
difference in trips to the free-throw line. The Cavaliers were 10
of 14 while the Knicks were 1 of 2 from the line.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing, unfazed by the crammed schedule that had the Knicks
playing their third game in four nights, was the only Knick with
his game in sync. Without Ilgauskas in his face, Ewing was free to
pop his short jumpers and barge inside for layins to keep the
Knicks within range.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the Knicks' passive demeanor came from the inability of
Johnson to roam with his usual aggressiveness underneath.
</P>
<P>
   As the game unfolded, Knicks Coach Jeff Van Gundy had to keep an
eye on his forward. During the Knicks' Tuesday victory against the
Raptors, Johnson's left knee tightened up due to tendinitis. At
times, Johnson struggled to keep up with Kemp. By the second half,
Van Gundy started out with Thomas on the Cavs' star.

FRANCE GRANTS EXTRADITION OF EINHORN IN 1977 KILLING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATT: Pa.)   (rk) 
 By   CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BORDEAUX, France _ Ira S. Einhorn, a former hippie convicted
while a fugitive of killing his girlfriend in Philadelphia 21 years
ago, can be extradited to the United States for a new trial if he
will not face the death penalty there, a French court ruled
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But Einhorn, 58, remained free after the Court of Appeals
ruling. He said nothing after the decision.
</P>
<P>
   His French lawyers said they would appeal, and said the process
would take two years.
</P>
<P>
   Einhorn returned to Champagne-Mouton, the French country village
where, 16 years after his disappearance from Philadelphia, the
police discovered him hiding out under a phony name in 1997 and
arrested him. After his release, he was ordered to report to the
authorities near his home twice a week.
</P>
<P>
   Elisabeth Hall, a sister of Helen (Holly) Maddux, the murder
victim, said after Thursday's verdict, ``I'm not really afraid the
way we used to be that he would flee and we wouldn't be able to
find him, but I wouldn't be surprised if he made a run for it. He
won't go very far for very long.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's decision reversed a 1997 ruling by the same court.
The 1997 ruling barred Einhorn's extradition because he would not
have had the right to a new trial and would have had to begin
serving the life sentence for first-degree murder that had been
imposed on him in Pennsylvania in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's ruling, the three judges said they had
reconsidered because Pennsylvania passed a law last year giving
people convicted in absentia the right to a new trial if they
returned and demanded one.
</P>
<P>
   This, plus legal assurances from American authorities that
Einhorn would not face the death penalty because his crime was
committed before Pennsylvania put the sentence on the books in
1978, put him on substantially the same legal footing as a murder
defendant would face in France, the judges ruled.
</P>
<P>
   But Theodore Simon, Einhorn's lawyer in Philadelphia, said in a
telephone interview that Pennsylvania courts could hold the new law
unconstitutional, voiding the official promises that made the
French court change its mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Legislature has never been able to direct courts to hold
new trials,'' Simon said. ``If Einhorn came back and asked for a
new trial, that doesn't mean that a judge would say yes.''
</P>
<P>
   The French judgment grants the extradition request provided, it
says, that ``Ira Einhorn in fact receives a fair new trial if he
asks for one on returning to the state of Pennsylvania'' and that
``the death penalty will not be requested and, if pronounced, not
carried out.''
</P>
<P>
   Since he had made no move to flee France after his arrest here,
they decided, there was no need to imprison him now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Einhorn is relieved because the decision leaves him a large
degree of maneuver,'' one of his lawyers, Dominique Delthil, said.
``He would have preferred a decision that would have made
unnecessary the appeals we are going to make now, to win the war
after losing this battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Einhorn was a charismatic, counterculture guru in his
Philadelphia days, active in the peace movement and advocating
communal living, Eastern mysticism and environmentalism.
</P>
<P>
   He jumped $40,000 bail and disappeared in late 1980 or early
1981 as he was about to go to trial in the 1977 killing of Miss
Maddux, a Bryn Mawr alumna who had been his companion.
</P>
<P>
   All he knew, he insisted, was that Miss Maddux had gone out
shopping and never returned. But a year and a half later, the
police found her body stuffed into a steamer trunk in Einhorn's
apartment after neighbors complained about odors and ceiling
stains.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Einhorn said the CIA or the KGB wanted to frame him
because he had uncovered classified mind-control experiments.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The mayor of Champagne-Mouton, Jack Jouaron, told Karl Zero, a
French television personality, earlier this year, ``Me, I believe
in the innocence of this man, who doesn't look like a killer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd love to keep him,'' the mayor added. ``He lives here in
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Einhorn lives as Eugene Mallon in a converted mill in the
village, a few hours northeast of Bordeaux. He speaks little
French. He and his wife, Anika Flodin, who is Swedish, bought the
house in 1993. Before then, Einhorn wandered through Britain,
Ireland, Denmark and Sweden, under other assumed names.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Flodin was with her husband in court Thursday, as were two
of Holly Maddux's three younger sisters, Mrs. Hall and Mary Maddux,
who said she could see Einhorn's face as he stood before Judge
Claude Arrighi to hear the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``I caught a glimpse of him being stunned when the translation
came,'' Mary Maddux, a graphic artist, said.
</P>
<P>
   Einhorn's lawyers said they would appeal Thursday's decision to
the Cour de Cassation, the highest court in France, which would not
be expected to rule on the extradition request for a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Even if that court upheld Thursday's ruling and Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin signed an extradition order, they said, Einhorn could
appeal to the Council of State, France's highest administrative
tribunal.

IN ADDED ROLE, PENTAGON CHIEF IS TRAVELING SALESMAN 
</HEADLINE>
 
(SUBS 8th graf to delete first phrase and add quote from Pentagon

 (ATTN: Ill., Ark., Mo., La.)  (mk) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ Fewer young people say they are willing to
consider military service. The number of veterans on Capitol Hill
declines with each new Congress. The armed services have shrunk,
and military bases are closing.
</P>
<P>
   The military's place in American society is not what it once
was. But has it really come to this? The secretary of defense has
started what he calls ``a very aggressive campaign'' to persuade
the public that the military still matters.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of appearances not normally associated with the
nation's top Defense Department official, Defense Secretary William
Cohen, who himself never served in uniform, is trying to make just
that case. The hope, Cohen says, is to ``reconnect America to its
military'' before what many have portrayed as a widening gap
between the military and civilian cultures becomes a more dangerous
breach.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, he took his campaign to the headquarters of
Microsoft Corp., the computer-software giant whose ranks are filled
with a generation of the sort of educated, innovative young people
who now seem to give little thought to a stint in the all-volunteer
military, let alone a career.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is also a gap that exists between some in this industry
and our military,'' Cohen told some 150 polite and attentive
employees gathered in Building 43 on Microsoft's sprawling campus
here in Redmond. ``It's not unique to this industry, but is
somewhat indicative of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   In introducing Cohen, Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft,
noted that the Defense Department was Microsoft's largest client
and discussed ways the two could do even more business together in
the future. But Cohen devoted the bulk of his remarks to a
recitation of the military's role in insuring the global stability
that allows companies like Microsoft to prosper.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said: ``We have to be mindful that the prosperity derived
from our vibrant world economy, the stability which allows vigorous
trade, and the economic and intellectual freedom that enables
innovation, would be simply impossible without the persuasiveness
of our ideals, the persistence of our diplomacy, and the power and
actions and the sacrifices of our U.S. military.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen ``has become personally seized with the idea,'' the
Pentagon's spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, said. ``He believes if people
don't understand what the military does, they won't support it,''
Bacon added.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Cohen addressed the Illinois General Assembly in
Springfield, calling for moral and political support for the armed
services. In the weeks ahead, trips are planned to the Arkansas
Legislature, the Kansas City Board of Trade and City Hall in New
Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Hess, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in
Washington, said he would have expected a secretary of state, not
defense, to have to make a public plea for attention, as Madeleine
Albright did to advocate foreign aid when she first became
secretary in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been felt that Defense had its own constituency,''
Hess said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, that is what makes Cohen's campaigns even more unusual.
As an institution, the military remains widely respected. A Harris
poll released just two weeks ago said Americans had more confidence
in the military than in any other American institution, beating out
the Supreme Court, Wall Street and organized religion. What's more,
many cities are deeply shaped by the military's presence _ imagine
San Diego without the Navy _ and the armed services still have
enormous influence in Congress and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cohen said there was a danger that that support had
already begun to wane.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's less of a presence in the daily lives of most
Americans,'' Cohen said in an interview at the Pentagon the other
day. ``And so to the extent that they are not reminded of the role
the military plays day in and day out, there's a danger they will
not be as supportive.''

<P>
   For Cohen, this campaign has a practical side, too. President
Clinton, under pressure from the Pentagon, has proposed more than
$100 billion in new defense spending over the next six years. And
while Republicans in Congress are inclined to spend even more,
there are some lawmakers who question why there needs to be any
increase.
</P>
<P>
   It is not at all clear what effect Cohen's campaign has had or
will ever have. After his address to the Illinois Legislature, in
which he appealed for support for those serving ``from the frozen
hills of Korea and Bosnia to the flight line at Scott Air Force
Base'' near Belleville, Ill., Cohen was surrounded by lawmakers
wanting to know whether his visit somehow meant the Pentagon
intended to close Scott.
</P>
<P>
   Others say Cohen's campaign is not enough. ``Talking to the
chamber of commerce here and there is not going to help the
problem,'' said John Hillen, a former Army captain and now senior
fellow at the Center for Strategic Studies in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Hillen said the services needed to do more to recruit society's
elite, perhaps by offering shorter stints or offering military
scholarships beyond those given to the service academies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd think the bigger problem is down the road,'' he said,
``when we have an entire corps of leaders, whether in business or
politics or academia, who don't have a clue what the military is
all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's remarks Thursday seemed well received. Sarah Wustner,
23, a Microsoft programmer, said she agreed that the military had
``a lot less of a presence'' in the lives of people like her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Navy kept sending me letters when I was in school,
offering scholarships,'' Ms. Wustner said. ``But I thought why
would I want to give up my life when I could be creating new
technology.''

<P>
   SEATTLE _ Owners of the New Carissa waited more than 24 hours to
hire a salvage tug after the freighter ran aground off Coos Bay,
Ore., according to one of the tug's owners.
</P>
<P>
   While foul weather proved to be the major impediment in rescuing
the 639-foot freighter, Oregon's Department of Environmental
Quality is concerned enough to investigate the response to the
grounding, and it may propose that faster actions be required in
future shipwrecks.
</P>
<P>
   The freighter's owners eventually hired the Salvage Chief, a
203-foot tug from Astoria that is the best equipped tug in the
region to pull ships off shorelines.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of immediately hiring the tug on the morning of Feb.
4 _ the day the freighter ran around _ owners-representative Bill
Milwee of Portland's Gallagher Marine asked only that the tug be
placed on standby, said Tim Beaver, a part-owner of the Salvage
Chief.
</P>
<P>
   Not until the following afternoon did the ship's owners and
insurors verbally agree to hire the Salvage Chief to rescue the
stranded freighter, Beaver said.
</P>
<P>
   By then the sea had grown so rough on the notorious Columbia Bar
that the Salvage Chief could not get out of Astoria. Bad weather
held it in port through last Friday and Saturday, while in Coos Bay
heavy seas battered the New Carissa. And after further delays
rigging the freighter for towing, officials decided the following
Wednesday that it was too damaged to tow.
</P>
<P>
   Could the Salvage Chief have set out sooner and begun salvage
operations before so much damage was done? Beaver, Milwee and state
and federal officials doubted it.
</P>
<P>
   The big tug takes time to round up a crew and provisions for a
major salvage. Milwee said the tug's departure was delayed by the
need to truck fuel for it from Portland to Astoria. ``They got down
here as quickly as they could,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Beaver was less sure, but ultimately agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the ship's owners get little credit for that. When the
Salvage Chief first tried to embark for Coos Bay last Friday, it
still had not been hired. The tug's owners figured it was clearly
the best vessel for the job, Beaver said, and assumed they would
get hired. Milwee concurred.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty and delay recalled controversies that boiled a
decade ago, when the Exxon Valdez spilled epic amounts of oil in
Prince William Sound. State officials criticized Exxon, the
tanker's owner, and the Alyeska Pipeline Co., the terminal
operator, for their slow response with floating oil boom and
skimmers to clean up the spill.
</P>
<P>
   After the Exxon Valdez ran aground, the first cleanup vessel was
caught unprepared and left the Alyeska terminal some 12 hours after
the tanker ran aground. That was much slower than the two-hour
response called for by the Alyeska's contingency plan, but less
than half the time that the New Carissa's owners took to hire the
Salvage Chief.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon and Washington currently require contingency plans for
oil spills, but have no such requirement for groundings, state
officials said. Since groundings can lead to spills, both states
are beginning to consider whether they should require contingency
planning for groundings, including advance contracts with salvage
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it would at least expedite the contract negotiations,
and I'd hope it would facilitate the gearing up of the vessel to
respond,'' said Mike Zollitsch, spill management coordinator for
Oregon's DEQ. In the New Carissa incident, he noted, the
negotiations remain shrouded in mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, stormy surf prevented Coast Guard crews from pumping
fuel out of the broken bow section of the grounded freighter, while
a new fracture in the ship heightened urgency to try to empty its
tanks of more than 100,000 gallons of fuel. Crews hoped to have the
oil off by early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The tug boat Sea Victory and an emergency marine spill response
vessel, the Astoria-based Oregon Responder, were standing by to tow
the bow section 200 miles out to sea and sink it with guns, but the
timing was dependent on the weather.
