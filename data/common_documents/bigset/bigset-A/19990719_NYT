WHAT CAN'T HE DO?

<P>
   STATELINE, Nev. _ Someone check Fernando Vargas' ID. This guy
couldn't be 21.
</P>
<P>
   A boxer that age, with only 16 bouts behind him, doesn't fight
as he did during his 11th-round knockout of Raul Marquez on
Saturday night at Caesars Tahoe. Unless he's a great fighter, or at
least a great fighter-to-be.
</P>
<P>
   In his 17 bouts, the Oxnard resident already has won a major
world championship _ the youngest ever to capture a junior
middleweight title _ and has convincingly beaten two experienced,
tough-as-they-come opponents, Yory Boy Campas and Marquez.
</P>
<P>
   That's a career for most good fighters.
</P>
<P>
   And the !ital!way he has done it is particularly remarkable.
Simply, he fights as if he's been in this game a lot longer than a
scant 2{ years.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of young fighters are undisciplined in the ring, or
uncertain of themselves, or both. Not Vargas. He somehow has poise
beyond his years and unwavering confidence. And he's constantly
thinking, which many veteran fighters don't do.
</P>
<P>
   Even after a painful low blow Saturday, he remembered what was
at stake and kept his cool _ as if it never happened.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of his skills, he's a complete fighter. He's a
well-schooled boxer. He can punch. He can !ital!avoid a punch but
take one well when it slips through. He knows when to be patient
and when to move in for the kill. Ask Marquez about that last item.
</P>
<P>
   He has the fury of a young Roberto Duran both in the ring and
out of it, the kind that intimidates opponents before the fight and
puts them flat on their backs during it. And he has the calculating
mentality to make the most of that rage.
</P>
<P>
   What can't he do? There aren't many fighters about whom one can
ask that question and not come up with an answer. Roy Jones Jr. and
Shane Mosley are two of the few who come to mind.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so that we don't risk going overboard, it's important to
note that it's a long way to the Hall of Fame from here.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Vargas' toughest tests are ahead of him. How he
responds to them will determine exactly how great he will be.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who witnessed Saturday's fight as HBO's television
analyst, used Oscar De La Hoya as a comparison. In De La Hoya's
17th fight, in 1995, he met crafty, even dirty veteran John John
Molina and barely escaped with a victory in what turned out to be a
ugly, hold-and-hit brawl.
</P>
<P>
   However, De La Hoya passed the test and has gone on to much
bigger things.
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to see what happens with Vargas when he
is in a similar position, when he's hurt or confused, or when
something else goes wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when we'll know,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   It's fun to watch in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   __ Comparison: Vargas is farther along than De La Hoya at the
same stage in their careers.
</P>
<P>
   After 17 fights, Molina was De La Hoya's only opponent of note
and Molina moved up in weight to fight him. That bout took place
shortly after De La Hoya turned 22.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya had won two titles by that time, but they were of the
marginal WBO variety. He wouldn't win a !ital!major title until he
knocked out Rafael Ruelas to win the IBF lightweight belt in his
next fight.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya didn't get into the meat of his opposition until
1997, when he faced Miguel Angel Gonzalez and Pernell Whitaker.
</P>
<P>
   Consensus was that De La Hoya was coddled; clearly, Vargas
hasn't been.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, the fact De La Hoya won the gold medal in the 1992
Olympics and had tremendous name recognition as a result played a
role in his choice of opponents. He was making a fortune fighting
nobodies. Who can blame him?
</P>
<P>
   Vargas, who failed to medal in the 1996 Games, has had to make a
bigger splash in the ring to build his name.
</P>
<P>
   __ Long distance: Of course, Vargas was pleased with his
one-sided victory over Marquez. However, he and trainer Eduardo
Garcia seemed to be particularly satisfied with the fact he went 11
strong rounds.
</P>
<P>
   He had never been past seven.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't train to go six, seven rounds. I train to go 12
rounds,'' Vargas said. ``I didn't have to (Saturday). I was ready,
though.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia said the experience was invaluable.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needed that,'' Garcia said. ``It's very important for his
career to have fights like that, to learn. He did very well. I'm
very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Tua Tua Tua: David Tua's one-round destruction of capable
Gary Bell on the Vargas-Marquez undercard was nothing short of
devastating.
</P>
<P>
   Bell was the sparring partner who reportedly manhandled Evander
Holyfield before the first Holyfield-Mike Tyson fight. He's no
championship contender, but he's a tough guy.
</P>
<P>
   However, Tua never gave Bell a chance to throw a meaningful
punch, burying him in thunderous blows reminiscent of a young Mike
Tyson. The ``fight'' was over in 79 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Tua, angling for an opportunity to fight for a world
title, said, ``I'll fight anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is, who's going to risk a title against him?
</P>
<P>
   Tua and Bell have an interesting connection.
</P>
<P>
   Bell is managed by Holyfield, while Tua is co-managed by Kevin
Barry, the same Kevin Barry whom Holyfield knocked out cold after
the referee yelled ``stop'' in a semifinal bout in the 1984
Olympics. Holyfield was disqualified but ultimately was awarded a
bronze medal. Barry won the silver.
</P>
<P>
   __ Second career: De La Hoya has signed a multialbum recording
contract with EMI Latin records.
</P>
<P>
   His first CD, which he will record in Spanish, is scheduled for
a Valentine's Day release.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya also will be breaking into the business end of the
record industry. He and EMI agreed on a joint venture, Golden Boy
Records, which will target the mainstream Latin market.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many years, I have wanted to sing,'' De La Hoya said,
``and now I finally have the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got my fighting from my father and my singing from my
mother.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Rabbit punches: Jones, reportedly looking for a heavyweight
matchup, said Saturday he will fight at that weight only for a
world championship and the money that goes with it. ``Otherwise,
what's the point?'' he said. . . . Former four-time champion
Michael Carbajal will take a big step in his comeback when he
challenges WBO junior bantamweight champ Jorge Arce on July 31 in
Tijuana. Carbajal, 31 and a veteran of many wars, returned from an
18-month ``retirement'' to stop journeyman Oscar Calzada in the
fourth round on July 2. Carbajal said he's as good as ever. ``I'm
not as fast (as I was),'' he told the Arizona Republic. ``But I'm
as strong as I ever was. My punches are more precise.'' . . .
Undefeated Erik Morales defends his WBC super bantamweight title
against No. 1 contender Reynante Jamili in the main event on that
card. . . . Unbeaten heavyweight Ed Mahone faces Derrick Banks in a
12-round bout on July 24 in Las Vegas on a Forum-promoted card.
Also on the card, Edgar Ruiz takes on veteran David Kamau in a
12-round welterweight matchup. &QL;

COMEBACK WIN AT SAFECO GIVES MARINERS SENSE OF RELIEF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The sun came out, the roof rolled back, the bats
heated up and the bullpen got tough. It was home-sweet-home for the
Mariners Sunday on the kind of day where players became fans,
basking in the warmth of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That had to be a great game for fans to watch,'' Mariners
first baseman David Segui said. ``For us as players, we see so many
games, it's very rare to have a game where you get totally
engrossed in it. But the intensity just seemed so high. We wanted
it bad today.''
</P>
<P>
   They proved it by scoring the last seven runs of an 8-7,
10-inning victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks. The Mariners
evened their record at Safeco Field, and they're learning more and
more about how it plays. Rock-'em, sock-'em Kingdome ball has given
way to ... baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've actually played four good baseball games here,'' manager
Lou Piniella said. ``We've won two and we've lost two, but we're
starting to see some positive things out there. And today, a
comeback win like that against a good Arizona team is no small
feat.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners have come back before. They did so in the Safeco
opener, of course, before losing in the ninth. Just two weeks ago
in Texas, they made up an even bigger deficit than Sunday's,
surviving despite a high-wire act by the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the relief corps shined as Ken Cloude, Jose Paniagua and
Jose Mesa held the Diamondbacks to one run in 72/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early in the game, when we give up a couple of runs, we've got
a lot of ballgame left,'' Cloude said. ``If we can hold it close,
we're going to get an opportunity to win. Today was crucial for us.
We need to get things going in the right direction, and this is a
great building block.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona got to starter John Halama for six runs in 21/3 innings,
the shortest of Halama's 16 major league starts. Five runs came in
the third inning, a ``comedy of errors,'' said pitching coach Stan
Williams, typified by a double play grounder that hit second base
and prolonged the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 6-0 with two on and one out, Cloude got a pop up and a
strikeout to stifle the scoring. He gave up one run over the next
three innings, and by the time Paniagua came on for the seventh,
the M's were within 7-6. The Diamondbacks never scored again,
making Russ Davis' 10th-inning single off Byung-Hyun Kim the
game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the bullpen holding the game in check, you could score
seven runs and you're still going to lose,'' said Piniella, who has
seen such scenarios before. ``But today, the bullpen came in and
buttoned up the hatch, and that was it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like starter Jeff Fassero on Friday, Cloude said he pitched more
comfortably in Safeco Field. He walked Greg Colbrunn, one of the
most impatient hitters in baseball, to start the fifth inning, and
got mad at himself for doing so. At Safeco, Williams has been
telling his pitchers, you might as well let the hitters try to beat
you.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get behind somebody, you've got to throw it down the
middle and make them hit it out of this ballpark,'' Cloude said.
``It takes a well-hit ball to get out of here. The ball doesn't
carry as well over here as it did in the Kingdome, and there's
grass, too. A ball in the gap is not going to go to the wall like
it did in the Kingdome. It could end up being a single instead of a
double or triple like it would have been in the Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt there's numerous advantages being over here
for a pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners offense is learning to make its own advantages. Ken
Griffey Jr. stroked his 30th homer in the fourth, into the
standing-room-only crowd just to the left of center field. The M's
manufactured the rest of their runs, getting three off sacrifice
flies and four off singles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of us are going to have to rely more on hitting the ball
on the ground and concentrating on hitting balls in the gap, line
drives,'' Davis said, noting that players like Griffey and
Rodriguez, who have power to all fields, will not have major
problems with Safeco Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the rest of us that are going to have to concentrate on
doing some more things,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey also showed off another part of his game. He walked to
lead off the seventh, stole second, went to third on a throwing
error by catcher Kelly Stinnett and scored the tyying run on a fly
ball by Edgar Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what this park is going to do,'' Piniella said. ``I've
seen it over four games. You're going to have to do different
things than just slug. It's going to make you a better team, it
sharpens you up for the road and allows you to do things on a
consistent basis to beat good pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just fun, because of the electricity in the air. It's
really a baseball feel.''

MARINERS SIGN TOP DRAFT PICK CHRISTIANSON  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The state championship game was about to start, and
even California's best player had a little nervous energy. After
the last warmup pitch, Ryan Christianson, the catcher for Arlington
High in Riverside, sailed his throw past second base and into the
outfield.
</P>
<P>
   The predictable chirping started in the Wilson High dugout at
Edison Field in Anaheim. Christianson glanced at the bench,
dismissing the taunts with a quick wave of his arm. When Wilson's
first hitter reached base, Christianson erased him on a stolen base
attempt. He later homered in Arlington's one-run victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a tough kid,'' said Roger Jongewaard, Mariners vice
president for scouting and player development.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the Mariners paid for that toughness and the skills that
come with it. Christianson, the 11th player chosen in last month's
draft, signed with Seattle for a bonus believed to be worth $2.1
million. The 18-year-old, who had a scholarship to UCLA, also
received more than $100,000 for college. The largest bonus the
Mariners have ever paid an amateur player is $2.175 million to
pitcher Ryan Anderson in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Christianson will report to rookie-level Peoria, Ariz., on
Thursday. After a couple of weeks, said scouting director Frank
Mattox, the Mariners will evaluate Christianson's progress to
determine if he's ready for Class A Everett. He will take batting
practice at Safeco Field Monday, and hopes to be there for good
soon enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'll be a little disappointed if I'm not up here in at
least four years,'' Christianson said. ``I don't know why I
wouldn't be.''
</P>
<P>
   Christianson batted .514 with eight home runs, 40 runs batted in
and nine stolen bases this year, winning the high school player of
the year award in California. He was rated the seventh-best
prospect in the draft by Baseball America.
</P>
<P>
   Christianson's defensive skills are considered more advanced
than his hitting, though he does have some experience using wooden
bats. But what really stands out, Mattox said, is his leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we need to take into consideration is Ryan's makeup,
his ability to communicate,'' Mattox said. ``As a catcher, you are
their No. 1 target and also the person who calls the game.
Offensively he has a lot of tools also, and we'll see some
offensive numbers from him. Defense right now may be his strong
suit, but he has several strong suits.''
</P>
<P>
   He also has Mariner bloodlines. Christianson already has been to
Peoria and Everett, both stops in his brother Robby's Mariner
career. Robbie Christianson, a 29th-round draft choice in 1995,
spent 2{ years in the minors before retiring last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked about a lot of things, and it's kind of nice,''
the older Christianson said. ``I know a lot of the people in the
organization, so it's going to be easy for him to feel comfortable.
He's going to do well. He's not going to need my help, but I'll be
following him very closely.''
</P>
<P>
   Christianson could have waited longer to sign; before the draft,
there was talk he would go fourth to the Arizona Diamondbacks,
which would have meant a bigger bonus. By signing now, he can still
have a month and a half in the minors this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have waited around another month or so to squeeze a
few more dollars, but when you weigh that against getting out there
and playing, it's not worth it in the long run,'' said Larry
Reynolds, Christianson's agent and the brother of former Mariner
Harold Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners now have signed 16 of their first 20 picks, and may
be close to an agreement with UW pitcher Jeff Heaverlo, drafted
between the first and second rounds as compensation for the loss of
Mike Timlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not that far apart,'' Jongewaard said.
</P>
<P>
   FLY, FLY AWAY: There's no greater authority on the home run ball
than David Vincent of the Society for American Baseball Research.
Vincent, who compiled the Home Run Encyclopedia, was in town over
the weekend to see Safeco Field for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ken Griffey is a guy who would hit home runs if he played in
Grand Canyon Park,'' Vincent said. ``He's going to hit line drives
and put them out of here. And he's a money hitter: Look what he did
in the Home Run Derby. (Safeco Field) might slow him down a little,
but I don't think it's going to be that big a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Vincent reports, the Mariners' 151 home runs at the
All-Star break established a new record for homers at that
juncture.
</P>
<P>
   MISMATCH: The matchup to watch Monday night is Edgar Martinez
against Brian Anderson. Until going 0-for-3 against the Arizona
left-hander last year, Martinez was 13-for-17 lifetime with three
home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's tough on guys like me that he can sit back (against) and
see the ball a long time,'' said Anderson, a finesse pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Said Martinez: ``You're going to have good days and bad days
against anybody. He throws the ball pretty good and he's going to
get me out.''
</P>
<P>
   YOUNG UNIT SELECTED: Mariners prospect Ryan Anderson is 5-10
with a 5.11 ERA at Class AA New Haven this year, but the honors
keep coming in. After pitching in the Double-A All-Star Game and
the All-Star Futures Game in Boston, Anderson has been named to the
United States team for the Pan Am Games.

BIG UNIT'S ABSENCE LEAVES MARINER HOLE NO SUNNY DAY CAN FILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Freakish, is what it was: Sunburn at a Mariners home
game.
</P>
<P>
   What's next? An entertaining Seafair hydro race? A successful
Olden Polynice free throw? A stadium cost underrun?
</P>
<P>
   All things seemed possible on an eye-candy day for baseball, the
first in the Guilty Pleasure's four tries.
</P>
<P>
   The afternoon was so surreal, it didn't seem yet like the
Seattle home field, from which old lyrics still linger.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) Buy me some concrete and speaker shots/I don't care
if I ever get tan. (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   Delirium was short-lived, however. M's reality raised its
misshapen self when starter John Halama was the latest pitching
casualty: six runs given up in two innings.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the hitters bailed him out, coming back on the
National League Arizona Diamondbacks 8-7 with a National League
game of handle-shot singles and stolen bases.
</P>
<P>
   Halama's sudden flame-out after seven straight wins, besides
being distressing for Mariners fans, came under a long shadow,
which had nothing to do with Sunday's unemployed roof.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson was back in town. For the Mariners, a shadow gets
no bigger.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't pitch until Tuesday, but the Big Unit's still the
buzz.
</P>
<P>
   Always has been, for 9{ years in Seattle. Probably always will
be. The most intriguing figure in Mariners history remains a
happening.
</P>
<P>
   Only he happens now for the Diamondbacks. In the year since he's
been gone, the absence of that happening is the Seattle franchise's
screaming void.
</P>
<P>
   Such was his presence that with him as ace, the Mariners were a
scary, glamorous team, even though he appeared only once every five
days. Without him, they are little more than ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   The season-long progress of Halama and fellow rookie pitcher
Freddy Garcia, along with the potential flashed by second baseman
Carlos Guillen before his early season injury, has produced some
revisionist thinking about the trade of the game's most formidable
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   The idea now is that the Mariners actually made a fine trade.
Certainly, the Mariners' future has improved. But as the deal's
July 31 anniversary approaches, the club has advanced from 12 games
below .500 to three games below.
</P>
<P>
   Progress, yes, but the depth of last year's hole was prompted in
large part by the collapse of the relationship between Johnson (he
was 9-10 with a 4.33 ERA before the trade) and his bosses.
</P>
<P>
   Without brutalizing that dead horse, the fact is that the trade
of Johnson was costly in ways beyond the one-year comparative
records.
</P>
<P>
   Because they received no veteran help in return, the Mariners
gave notice that they were writing off the final two months of
1998. And by failing to acquire even a partial equivalent to his
No. 1 presence in the off-season, the Mariners were telling fans
they weren't serious about 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The consequence was reflected partly in first-half attendance in
the Kingdome that was off more than 15 percent, the second-biggest
drop in the majors. Additionally, the nominal No. 1, Jeff Fassero,
admitted his poor start was at least partly attributable to the
pressure he felt to fill the Johnson void.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the psychological aspect. Opposing hitters flat
dreaded facing the pre-1998 Johnson. Lefties up to and including
the great Wade Boggs would beg out of the lineup, causing managers
to scrounge the bench looking for rookie stand-ins. Mariners
fielders knew that every fifth day they wouldn't feel like they had
just run a half-marathon.
</P>
<P>
   And the fans? Late in his Seattle career, every Johnson game was
an event, accounting for an 8,000-per-game attendance spike.
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course, the stadium is the event, but no opposing
manager has to go out of his way to deal with Seattle pitching,
except to keep order when two or three batters at a time clamber
over each other to get in the box for hacks.
</P>
<P>
   Effective as Halama and Garcia have been for rookies, Sunday's
blow-up by Halama is an expected development for any first-year
pitcher, and the Mariners have three of them (including 20-year-old
Gil Meche) in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot is that two weeks prior to this year's trading
deadline, the Mariners have come nowhere close to making up for
what they had.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, they saved money. The 35-year-old Johnson's $52 million,
four-year deal with Arizona eclipsed all market estimates of his
worth, and would have been burdensome for the Mariners in
attempting to clear the financial table to keep Ken Griffey Jr. and
Alex Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   But keeping a mediocre team around the two stars almost
guarantees the club won't get the privilege of paying either or
both. Granted, it was a hard decision. But the 1999 results so far
show they're still paying for the choice made.

   During spring training, Johnson said he couldn't wait to face
his old club. But Sunday, in a pre-game press conference, he was
backpedaling for public consumption.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might have made it sound that way,'' he said. ``But I've
always thought it was the best lineup in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   While Johnson may have his apprehensions about Tuesday, his
presence in opposing colors causes the entire organization and many
Mariners fans to relive what might have been.
</P>
<P>
   The glare from those reflections may generate more heat than
anything felt during Sunday's sun-kissed loll in the new yard.

METS DEFEAT ORIOLES, 8-6 
</HEADLINE>

   BALTIMORE _ He is 40 years old. And he is no longer the most
feared base runner in the game, or even on his own team. But Rickey
Henderson can still take over a game, and he did it again on Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson was a key figure in three rallies in the New York
Mets' 8-6 victory over the Baltimore Orioles before a sellout crowd
of 47,480 at Camden Yards. In five plate appearances, he homered,
walked and singled twice to raise his average to .319. About the
only thing associated with a leadoff hitter that Henderson did not
do was steal a base.
</P>
<P>
   But as the man with 1,324 career stolen bases said a couple of
days ago: ``I just try to create. I don't need no more bases. I
don't think anybody's going to catch me. The biggest thing for me
to do is to try to cross the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson did just that three times on Sunday night to give him
2,060 runs for his career, bringing him within two of Willie Mays
for fifth on the career list, as the Mets (53-40) pulled to within
four games of the first-place Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson led off the game with a home run, the 75th time he had
done that, extending another of his many major league records.
</P>
<P>
   That led to a two-run first inning. And the Mets, behind six and
one-third competent innings from Masato Yoshii (7-7), had things in
hand, even though the Orioles rallied for four runs in the seventh
and another in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Before then, Henderson had done all he could to make it a
blowout.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, with Yoshii holding a 2-1 lead, Henderson beat out
an infield single to short. Three innings earlier, he had been
thrown out trying to steal second against the Orioles' gifted
catcher, Charles Johnson. This time, Henderson patiently waited.
</P>
<P>
   Edgardo Alfonzo drew a walk off Juan Guzman (4-8) and Henderson
took second. John Olerud beat out a potential double play ball to
second, and Henderson went to third.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza followed with a single to left center, and Henderson
scored. The Mets now led by 3-1, and before the inning was over, it
would be a 5-1 game.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, Henderson teamed with Roger Cedeno to key yet
another rally. Cedeno walked with one out and Henderson followed
with a single to left. Alfonzo singled to left to score a sliding
Cedeno from second, and Olerud singled to left to score Henderson
from second. The Mets were on their way to another three-run inning
to make it an 8-1 game.
</P>
<P>
   With Henderson at the top of the order and Cedeno at the bottom,
``they create some havoc, back-to-back, no doubt about that,'' Mets
Manager Bobby Valentine had said two nights before. ``Having them
like that probably maximizes our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Valentine, he will not have another chance to
bat Cedeno ninth and Henderson first after Tuesday night's game
here. Not unless the Mets make the World Series this fall since
after this three-game series, the Mets are done with interleague
play, and the use of the designated hitter in an American League
park.

RANGERS CONSTRUCT NL-STYLE VICTORY
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ One of best teams in the National League
showed up at The Ballpark in Arlington and got beat at their own
game.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, known for hitting the ball in the seats more than
behind a runner, showed they can win with a style more suited to
the National League. They won by manufacturing runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, using the hit-and-run, sacrifice fly and stolen
base, made the most of six singles and a double to support starter
Mike Morgan and defeated the San Francisco Giants, 5-4, last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did some things well tonight,'' Rangers manager Johnny
Oates said. ``Offensively I don't remember any fireworks or music
playing on long ball but we scored enough on short ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan got the victory, his 10th of the season, and John
Wetteland got the save with a scoreless ninth, his first after
three consecutive blown-save opportunities. It was his 27th save of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the best closers in the business,'' Morgan said.
``We win together as a team and we lose together. We're all going
to fail sometime but the bottom line is putting it behind you and
get after it the next night. John went right back out there and got
it done for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, who at one point retired 10 consecutive hitters on
ground balls, lasted 61/3 innings to notch the victory, marking the
first time since 1993 he has won at least 10 games in a season.
</P>
<P>
   He's 10-6 despite a 5.38 earned-run average partly because the
Rangers average 8.26 runs per start, the highest run support of any
starter in the majors. The run support was still there last night,
it just came the hard way rather than by muscle.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had two stolen bases, executed two key hit-and-run
plays, hit two sacrifice flies and had three two-out run-scoring
hits. They also got their bodies in the way at the right time. Two
hit batters by Giants pitcher Mark Gardner ended up crossing the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always don't have to hit a three-run homer,'' outfielder
Rusty Greer said. ``Tonight, we put men on base and got some timely
hits. Fortunately there were some guys in scoring position. To me,
the key is putting guys on base. The more you do that, the more you
have a chance of driving them in, whether it's by home run or
manufacturing runs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers manufactured them, starting in the second inning
when Gardner hit Juan Gonzalez and walked Rafael Palmeiro and moved
them to second and third with a wild pitch. Todd Zeile's sacrifice
fly scored one run, and Gregg Zaun, starting for Ivan Rodriguez,
bounced a single through the right side for a second run.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner also got into trouble in the fifth by hitting Royce
Clayton with a pitch. Mark McLemore then moved him to third by
slicing a hit-and-run single down the left-field line. That set up
Roberto Kelly's sacrifice fly. Then McLemore stole second and
scored on Greer's two-out grounder that got through the left side.
</P>
<P>
   ``They found a lot of holes,'' Gardner said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, after J.T. Snow's two-run homer cut their lead to
4-2, did so again in the sixth when Lee Stevens singled with one
out. Oates again went with a hit-and-run, which kept the Rangers
out of a double play when Zaun hit a routine grounder to short.
That left Stevens at second and he scored on Clayton's two-out
double off the right-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's reminiscent of National League baseball,'' Clayton
said. ``Guys had good at-bats and we were able to score without
hitting a home run. We knew coming into spring training, we could
score either way.''

WETTELAND HAS GAME IN PERSPECTIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By XXXXX XXXXXXX 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ One of John Wetteland's greatest attributes
is his ability to keep things within the context of real life.
That's why he made a few stops on his way home from the ballpark
Saturday after blowing yet another save in an 8-6 loss to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the game, I went out and saw Tommy, who's 9 years old
and has cancer,'' Wetteland said last night at The Ballpark in
Arlington. ``Then I stopped by Eric Gunderson's house and visited
with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gunderson, you might recall, just underwent rotator cuff surgery
and is out for the season, if not for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got home,'' Wetteland continued, ``a neighbor dropped
by just to give me a pep talk.''
</P>
<P>
   The message is simple: On the disaster scale, blowing a save
barely registers.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, it is his livelihood, and that's why Wetteland was feeling
much better after protecting the Rangers' 5-4 victory against the
Giants in the ninth inning last night. And he ``was'' hurting after
blowing that game Saturday ... right up to the point where he
looked into Tommy's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Then, yesterday afternoon he watched on television as former
teammate David Cone closed out a perfect game at Yankee Stadium.
Wetteland spent most of 1996 saving games for the New York
right-hander.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here he is, getting 27 straight outs,'' Wetteland sighed in
the Texas clubhouse, ``and I'm struggling to get two in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   He got two when he needed them most last night.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, the knee jerks out there _ and you know who you are
_ were gleefully pointing out that, once upon a time, Wetteland
saved games for the Rangers, too, but that the memory had grown
hazy over the past couple of rocky weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Tacky, tacky.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned that Wetteland might be listening to the
what-have-you-done-for-me-lately crowd, manager Johnny Oates
invited his closer into his office for a psyche massage before last
night's series opener against the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   This continues a disturbing 41/2-year trend by Oates of refusing
to panic, even when his closer had blown three consecutive saves
and five of eight. It's a (yawn) boring but generally effective
strategy and, by golly, it worked again.
</P>
<P>
   Called upon to protect a one-run lead in the ninth against the
Giants, Wetteland got a popup, surrendered a line single to center,
got another popup and then a routine fly out for his 27th save of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came in here and said, `I'm glad to get that gorilla off my
back,' '' Wetteland related.
</P>
<P>
   Slump over. End of story.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I tried to tell him was that we need to look at the big
picture,'' Oates said of the pregame meeting. ``I said, `Let's
eliminate the last seven or eight games and look at what you've
done for us all year. That's the benchmark of John Wetteland.' ''
</P>
<P>
   While the Chicken Littles in our midst were clamoring for
Wetteland's head on a platter, Oates rightly understood that his
job was to save Wetteland, not bury him. To show a lack of
confidence in his closer at this point would be to risk losing him
mentally for the season. In case you were wondering, that would not
be a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to make him understand that sometimes we get caught in
this tunnel vision as fans and as reporters, because we're consumed
with the present, we look short-term,'' Oates explained patiently.
``And in this game, if you look short-term, it creates confusion
and doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   What Oates and Wetteland discovered when they examined his
``slump'' rationally, was that, until Saturday, it was far more a
product of circumstances out of his control than poor pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``That one bad game \RSaturday\S came on the heels of three
games where some unusual things happened,'' Oates said. ``Is that
creating doubt in the fans' minds? Maybe. It's not creating any
doubt in our minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `The only thing I need to ask is, are you healthy?' He
said, `Yes.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Healthy but heartsick summed it up. Oates' message of confidence
was exactly what Wetteland needed to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helped, because he reinforced what I was already
thinking,'' Wetteland said. ``I know what's going on, you just
wonder if anybody else knows, if anybody else sees that you're
throwing good pitches, you're throwing strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more important was that Oates, who on Saturday said he
might consider giving Wetteland the day off, told him that if the
Rangers had a lead in the ninth, it would be his to protect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can control one thing every day and that's my attitude,
which includes my work ethic,'' Wetteland said. ``I have to trust
the things that embody attitude and go at it 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I can say of my failure is that I come by it
honestly.''
</P>
<P>
   Honest and humble, too. He can have my ninth innings as long he
wants them.
</P>

<P>
   BOURNE, Mass. _ After two fruitless days of searching for a
plane that disappeared off the coast of Martha's Vineyard with John
F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and his sister-in-law on board, the Coast
Guard said Sunday night that it had all but given up hope of
finding survivors and now was focused on recovering their remains.
</P>
<P>
   Rear Adm. Richard Larrabee said he had informed family members
that the odds of finding any survivors after 48 hours in the
68-degree water were remote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have spent some very painful moments with the families
tonight,'' Larrabee said in a news conference here at the Otis Air
National Guard base. ``They have been very understanding all along,
and very appreciative of what we have been trying to do, and it was
very difficult for me to share this information with them. But I
think they understood it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard abandoned the search for survivors after
conducting an intensive sweep Sunday of 364 square miles along the
southern coastline of Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the efforts of several Coast Guard cutters and
helicopters, ``We really didn't turn up an awful lot of new
information,'' Larrabee said, adding that the Coast Guard still had
not located Kennedy's single-engine Piper Saratoga.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to shift _ and I say shift very purposely _ from
our focus on search and rescue to search and recovery,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With that shift, command of the investigation was handed over to
the National Transportation Safety Board, the agency that has
jurisdiction over airplane accidents.
</P>
<P>
   For several hours Sunday afternoon, the Coast Guard seemed to be
closing in on the wreckage after it announced that it had detected
a single ping from an emergency beacon in a ``debris field'' on
waters off Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   But six hours later, Coast Guard officials acknowledged that the
ping apparently was misinterpreted by searchers circling the area
in a C-130 command plane. They said that information turned out to
be based on ``erroneous information,'' Larrabee said. The sound,
they said, may have been emitted by a floating Coast Guard data
marker, placed in the water during the search to help track the
effects of wind and tide.
</P>
<P>
   In Hyannis Port, the Kennedy family spent another long day
waiting and praying in their compound of white clapboard houses
overlooking Nantucket Sound. In the morning, three priests arrived
to say a private Mass for family members under the same white tent
where Rory Kennedy was to have been married Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the ceremony, Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., could
be seen holding the communion chalice, offering wine to Ethel
Kennedy, the widow of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, their
daughter Rory Kennedy and other family members. In the afternoon,
Senator Kennedy took several family members for a sail into the
Atlantic on his old blue wooden-hulled sloop, Maya.
</P>
<P>
   John Kennedy's sister, Caroline Kennedy, whose whereabouts had
been unclear since the accident, had awaited word at her home in
Bridgehampton, N.Y., on Long Island. It was not known why she did
not go to Hyannis Port for the wedding or join the family there
later. She and her family were said to have returned Saturday from
a Western rafting trip.
</P>
<P>
   The family of Kennedy's wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33, and
her sister Lauren Bessette, 34, also spent the day in seclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night at a White House dinner for Prime Minister Ehud
Barak of Israel, Clinton and the prime minister both offered their
prayers to the Kennedy and Bessette families.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are reminded again that life and its possibilities are
fleeting, that we mortals are obliged to be humble and grateful for
every day and to make the most of every day,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak offered this: ``We share America's sorrow tonight. The
little boy who sustained your nation and the world in a moment of
grief is lost at the high noon of his own promise with his wife and
her sister _ a family that has given up oh so much has suffered
another loss that can hardly be borne.''
</P>
<P>
   John Kennedy, the son of the 35th president, had planned to drop
his sister-in-law off at Martha's Vineyard on Friday night before
continuing on to Hyannis Port for his cousin's wedding, which has
been postponed indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   The clues on Saturday had seemed to point toward a rapid
conclusion to the hunt, with luggage and a prescription vial
washing ashore on Martha's Vineyard. Sunday, a plane's insulation
and headrest were added to the catalog of debris, but searchers
working by land, air and water found no firm evidence of the fate
of Kennedy, 38; his wife of nearly three years, or his
sister-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that underscored the size and complexity of the
evolving search and accident investigation, a ``unified command''
was established at Otis Air Force base on Cape Cod. The command
included representatives of the Coast Guard, the National
Transportation Safety Board, the Federal Aviation Administration,
the Navy, the Transportation Department, the National Oceanographic
and Atmospheric Administration and a variety of state agencies.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   More reinforcements were on the way. A second NOAA survey ship,
the 163-foot Whiting, was diverted from Delaware Bay and was
expected to arrive Monday. A Navy salvage vessel, the Grasp, was
expected to arrive on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard responds to 50,000 distress calls a year, and
rescue officials gamely insisted they were not giving special
treatment to the Kennedys. But in some respects, this search was
different, starting with the tremendous scrutiny from an
international contingent of reporters and photographers and from
the highest levels of government.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called Coast Guard officials here on Saturday night to
express his concern. Massachusetts Gov. Argeo Paul Cellucci called
as well.
</P>
<P>
   The search gave a schizophrenic air to the grassy, rose-rich
island of Martha's Vineyard. Vacationers lapped black raspberry ice
cream and ambled in sandles, while camera crews barged past as they
scrambled for position, and divers prepared for the possible
recovery of bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The island's mood was described in a simple message scrawled on
a chalk board overlooking the beaches where the first debris washed
up on Saturday. ``Moshup Beach and Aquinnah Beach our prayers are
with you John-John, Carolyn, Lauren,'' it read.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Taylor Scherer, 40, who lives in the village of West
Tisbury, walked barefoot on the beaches of Martha's Vineyard
Sunday, but she did not take her usual swim. ``It seems like their
resting place _ not some place I should be,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, people here and across the nation were in search of
resolution Sunday. For most of them, none was to be had.
</P>
<P>
   The area of the search seemed to expand and contract and shift
with each new shred of information or rumor.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday afternoon, after luggage from the Kennedy plane
washed ashore near Philbin Beach at the southwest tip of Martha's
Vineyard, the search area was narrowed to 550-square miles.
</P>
<P>
   But when the search resumed at full force at 5:30 a.m. Sunday,
the Coast Guard sent helicopters, airplanes and a small flotilla of
cutters and inflatable boats across an expanded search zone of
1,200-square miles. Still, Coast Guard officials seemed confident
they would soon find the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're no longer looking for a needle in a haystack,'' Larrabee
of the Coast Guard said at a 9 a.m. briefing Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But as the hours ticked past, the searchers met only with
maddening results.
</P>
<P>
   Searchers scoured the dunes and shoreline for more debris with
small all-terrain vehicles. They found nothing. The probed the
ocean floor with ultra-sensitive sonars aboard the Rude, the same
research vessel that had helped locate wreckage off Long Island
from TWA Flight 800. Again, nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Private boats and beach-combing tourists grimly joined the
effort in what Larrabee described as a ``tremendous outpouring of
sympathy.'' As Melissa Epstein, a tourist from Brooklyn, wandered
the beach with a friend, their thoughts were very much on the
Kennedy family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just looking at the cliffs and hoping they find them
safely,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   If and when the time comes, Sgt. William Freeman of the
Massachusetts State Police said, the diving team has the ability,
using inflatable bags, to lift a plane the size of Kennedy's, a
single-engine Piper Saratoga, from the depths.
</P>
<P>
   Though the water temperature was a chilly 68 degrees _ making
survival a remote possibility, especially since the plane was not
equipped with a life raft _ Coast Guard officials pressed on
throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they said, survival statistics show that the average person
cannot withstand more than 12 hours in such water. And yes, they
said, the statistics gave little reason for comfort after a second
day with no sign of life.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, said Larrabee early Sunday, ``We have all read
miraculous stories of people surviving under these types of
conditions, and that's what gives us hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the going was slow. The Rude began searching at 7 p.m. on
Saturday night. By midafternoon Sunday, it had completed a
painstaking sweep of just five square miles.
</P>
<P>
   But by noon, the searchers had very little to show for their
efforts. Three miles south of Martha's Vineyard, they recovered a
headrest, like the one that washed ashore on Saturday. A fuel slick
was spotted far outside the primary search area, but it was quickly
discounted as having any connection to the Kennedy plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not find a lot,'' Larrabee glumly reported at 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, word came of the day's first significant finding
_ bits of foam insulation that were scattered over a mile of beach.
Bird said the insulation was ``consistent'' with insulation that
would surround an airplane cockpit. In response to a reporter's
question, he acknowledged the obvious: That it likely would take an
impact of great force to produce such debris.
</P>
<P>
   But with the detection of the ping at about 3:45 p.m., the tone
shifted rapidly from official words of hope to outright
resignation. James Hall, chairman of the National Transportation
Safety Board, for one, began his first press briefing late Sunday
afternoon by saying, ``I deeply regret having to come before you on
such a difficult case.''
</P>
<P>
   Gone was any talk of miracles. Hall introduced Robert Pearce,
the NTSB investigator appointed to lead the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Pearce, a former military pilot who has investigated hundreds of
crashes involving small planes during his seven years with the
NTSB, offered new details about Kennedy's flight.
</P>
<P>
   After taking off at 8:38 p.m. without incident from Essex County
Airport in Fairfield, N.J., Kennedy's plane was tracked on radar as
it climbed to 5,600 feet, passing north of the Teterboro Airport in
New Jersey, and then heading east toward Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   At 9:26 p.m., the craft was west of Rhode Island, and still at
5,600 feet, though it soon began to descend. At 9:40 p.m., when it
was 17 or 18 miles from the Martha's Vineyard airport, the plane
was at 2,500 feet. Over the next 29 seconds, it dropped another 700
feet, a rate of descent that Pearce said was ``within the
airplane's capabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, with the plane still 16 miles from the airport,
radars lost contact. Pearce explained that the plane was below an
altitude where it could be detected by radar.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to examining radar data, NTSB investigators were
interviewing those familiar with Kennedy's flying abilities,
reviewing weather data and pulling all maintenance records
associated with the craft, though there were no immediate
indications of mechanical failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at the very beginning stages of what will be a
painstaking, detailed investigation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But veteran pilots repeatedly speculated that Kennedy, a
relatively inexperienced pilot, may have crashed after losing his
visual orientation in the haze and darkness over Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Cautioning that such speculation can be hurtful for family
members, Hall asked people to refrain from hasty conclusions about
the cause of the plane's disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer is simple,'' Hall said. ``At this point we do not
know. We will not know for some time. There is even a possibility
we will never know.''

KENNEDY FAMILY TRAGEDY STRIKES CHORD IN L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY YVETTE CABRERA 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Susan Butterfield still had the feeling of a bad
dream that wouldn't end as she arrived at church thinking about the
news of John F. Kennedy Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so jarring, so unexpected. ... You think, Again? Again? I
mean that poor family,'' said Butterfield of suburban Topanga
Canyon as she headed Sunday to St. Mel Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   Like thousands of others around the world, she grappled with the
news as if Kennedy were a brother, a son, a loved one.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Ramon Valera said so many concerned parishioners at St.
Mel approached him about Kennedy on Sunday that he included a
special prayer in the services.
</P>
<P>
   ``John has been a very good person and has tried his best to
project his goodness to other people,'' said Valera, who noted that
the Kennedys were loved by people in his native country of the
Philippines as much as in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   That the Kennedy tragedy touched so many was no surprise to Drew
Yellen, a clinical psychologist whose clients talked about it over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all like to have heroes, we all like to have princes and
princesses that we believe in for a fairy tale, and John F. Kennedy
Jr. filled that slot,'' Yellen said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Allen Chroman, an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry
at the University of California, Los Angeles, agreed that
``John-John,'' as he was known to the world, represented the
Kennedy legacy, the hope, the next in line.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very much an icon of our generation,'' Chroman said.
``The picture of him saluting the flag and saluting at his father's
funeral is one of the pictures of the century. It's one of those
things that helps us identify who we are.''
</P>
<P>
   At Yellen's Northridge practice, many of his clients likened the
Kennedy disappearance to the loss of Princess Diana.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people mentioned the similarities _ that you have
somebody who is that much in the public eye and is that much loved
by the public and then tragically disappears,'' Yellen said.
</P>
<P>
   Yellen predicted that the apparent loss of Kennedy would inspire
others to change, as death often leads people to honor the dead by
living out their values and priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Kennedy) did things right. He was untarnished. ... He really
set himself up as a role model,'' Yellen said. ``A lot of times
when there's a tragedy like this, people say, we need to step up
and take that place.''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Ingrid Jackson heard the news, she had the rosary and
healing groups at St. Mel pray for Kennedy, his wife and
sister-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   ``To us, (Kennedy) was like royalty for the United States,''
said Jackson, eucharistic minister at St. Mel. ``It's so tragic. He
did so much work on this Earth at 38 years than most people do in a
lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said the healing group prayed that search teams would
find Kennedy and then prayed for a miracle when they heard that
luggage and pieces of wreckage had been found.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Kennedy) was an important representative of our country
because he's the president's son, so of course we all feel the
tragedy,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Chroman believes the Kennedys symbolized Hollywood's flash and
glamour, but they also had more than their share of tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are us,'' Chroman said. ``There is a feeling of greatness
in the family and the feeling of vulnerability. There is a feeling
of greatness in our country, but also the feeling of risk and
vulnerability.''
</P>
<P>
   Yellen believes that part of the public's affinity for John John
was rooted in an affinity for his charismatic father, who as the
youngest U.S. president was able to connect with the younger
population.
</P>
<P>
   For those who lived through the Kennedy assassination that
fateful day in Texas and watched as son saluted father, their bond
to John F. Kennedy Jr. has only strengthened through the years as
they've watched him evolve, Yellen said. ``Regrettably, I think
people have become used to the idea that some type of trauma is
going to befall the Kennedys. They really do, simply by nature of
the fact that it's happened over and over,'' Yellen said. ``It's
not often that a family has a second chance at Camelot, and here
John F. Kennedy Jr. and Carolyn were on that path to that and again
struck by tragedy.''

DODGERS CAN'T PITCH PEREZ
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ The Dodgers' predicament isn't so much what to do
with pitcher Carlos Perez but what CAN they do with him.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently not much since he signed a three-year, $15.5 million
contract during the offseason. The left-hander's name has been
mentioned with the trading deadline approaching, but his poor
performance and apparent lack of commitment works against him.
</P>
<P>
   Perez is 2-9 and although his velocity is back in the high 80s,
he hasn't won since May. He also infuriated Dodgers brass when he
didn't show up for a mandatory workout Wednesday at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But with the financial commitment the Dodgers made to Perez this
and the next two years, pulling him from the starting rotation
doesn't seem to be an option for manager Davey Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever commitment the organization makes, it's my job to try
to support or help or get him back on track,'' Johnson said. ``I
have to try to get something. Whether it's this game or next game,
next week or next year, I have to make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez pitched six innings, allowing four runs and two homers _
he's allowed 22 this season _ but didn't get a decision against
Pittsburgh. The way the season's gone for him, that's considered a
good outing. Perez's ERA dropped from 6.95 to 6.88 and he's had two
straight quality starts (six innings, three earned runs or less)
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if the Dodgers' farm system wasn't barren, Johnson
might have already dipped into it for another starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I have to get something going for him,'' Johnson said.
``The easiest thing in the world is to say that's not working, go
to something else. . . . Then it has to do with choices, too. If
you're going to perform major surgery, it better make a big
difference. If not, you're going to have to live with it.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Increased role: Throughout the first half of the season,
Johnson has brought rookie left-hander Onan Masaoka along slowly.
But with Antonio Osuna done for the year with a partially torn
ulnar collateral ligament in his pitching elbow, it means rookies
Jamie Arnold and Masaoka will be used in tighter situations.
</P>
<P>
   Masaoka is proving he's ready. Since baby-stepping it through
the first two months of the season with a 4.26 ERA, the 21-year-old
has a 1.61 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Masaoka, you can see he's steadily gaining more confidence,''
Johnson said. ``Now, I bet if you talk to him, he'll tell you he
has things to work on, but now he knows how to get them out. With
Arnold and Masaoka, with them getting their feet on the ground, now
they can survive the bad outing.''
</P>
<P>
   __ FYI: Because Arnold will not have his appeal of a five-game
suspension heard until Aug. 6, he can start a game when the Dodgers
play a doubleheader against Colorado on Wednesday, if the Dodgers
so choose. . . . One reason Osuna wanted to come back and pitch the
final three months of the season was a $1.5 million option the club
holds for next season. The Dodgers aren't expected to pick it up
and might try to negotiate a contract for significantly less for
next season. Osuna isn't expected to be ready for the start of the
2000 season. . . . Before the game, a couple of Dodgers were giving
shortstop Mark Grudzielanek some grief, reminding him the dugout
walls are made of cement. It was here in early June that
Grudzielanek punched a wall and broke his hand, forcing him to miss
a month. . . . Eric Karros' sixth-inning double was his
team-leading 27th, leaving him four shy of his career high. . . .
The Dodgers and Pirates are playing the only non-interleague
series.

TEEN'S `CONTROLLED SCREAM' LANDS HER ON JAY LENO SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIKA HAYASAKI  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Tawnie Keaton, 13, mimics the shrill screech of a sea
gull so masterfully that even seasoned bird-watchers have trouble
deciphering her call from the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   It's a talent that has earned her a guest appearance on ``The
Tonight Show with Jay Leno.''
</P>
<P>
   Keaton will show off her talent to a nationwide audience
Wednesday, along with guests who specialize in dolphin, whale and
moose calls. The eighth-grader was awarded the all-expenses-paid
trip to California after the program's producers learned she was a
two-time winner of Port Orchard's Sea Gull Calling Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Keaton said she has never been on television and she is fretting
over what to wear.
</P>
<P>
   The Port Orchard teen, who plays basketball, enjoys science and
plans to run for student government next year, participated in Port
Orchard's contest about seven times since 1990. She won ``Most
Authentic Call'' in 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like a controlled scream to me,'' Keaton said.
``I can control the pitch and sound.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen to 40 bird callers participate in the Port Orchard
contest, which takes place each spring. Children and adults compete
for best call, best costume and who attracts the most birds.
</P>
<P>
   ``She watched the contest one year and tried it,'' said her
mother, Carolyn. ``It's just something she does with her tongue and
mouth ... she can do it behind you and it sounds like a sea gull is
behind you.''
</P>
<P>
   A producer of ``The Tonight Show'' contacted Port Orchard's
contest organizers a few months ago and asked them to refer a
memorable winner.
</P>
<P>
   Keaton, a bubbly teenager, stood out among other winners.
</P>
<P>
   After interviewing Keaton and watching a videotape of her
performing the call, producers asked her to fly to California from
her home on the Kitsap Peninsula, west of Seattle, and appear on a
special animal call segment.
</P>
<P>
   Keaton performed the call once in front of classmates and said
it was embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people laughed at me because it's a talent I haven't
really shared with my friends,'' Keaton said. ``They laughed and
said, `It sounds like a sea gull, I can't believe it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Allison Frye, 13, a friend of Keaton, admits she finds the
unique talent ``a little wierd.'' Nevertheless, Wednesday night
she'll be videotaping her friend screeching like a bird for the
world to see.

SPARKS AT THEIR BEST IN WIN OVER COMETS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Facing their toughest back-to-back test yet,
the Los Angeles Sparks responded with arguably their best game of
the season Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   They went on a 14-0 run in the second half to become only the
third team this season to defeat the Houston Comets, 78-65, holding
the defending WNBA champions to their second-lowest output of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Leslie led four Sparks in double-figures with 20 points,
plus 12 rebounds, as the home team wowed a season-high crowd of
12,178 at the Forum that was boosted by a postgame benefit rap
concert.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks (11-6), coming off a tough loss in Phoenix on
Saturday, prevented the seemingly untouchable Comets (14-3) from
developing any real flow. Tina Thompson, one of the awesome
threesome on the Houston squad along with Cynthia Cooper and Sheryl
Swoopes, was 0 for 8 from the floor, due partly to the defensive
work of DeLisha Milton and Leslie.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the best defense I've seen them play since
they've been in the league,'' Houston coach Van Chancellor said.
``The Sparks played extremely well. They lost to Phoenix yesterday.
It looked like they were on a mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Sparks coach Orlando Woolridge agreed with Chancellor's
assessment and was grateful for his praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means a lot to me for him to say that,'' Woolridge said.
``I consider him like a mentor. We did some different things
defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks trailed 35-33 at the break, but Milton ignited a 14-0
run to go ahead 48-37. Swoopes (21 points) broke a five-minute
drought by the Comets, but it didn't shift the momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge step forward,'' said Woolridge, whose team has
won eight of its last 10 games. ``This really proves that we can
play good basketball. Hopefully, this will catapult us to the next
level in the second half (of the season).''

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
LOS ANGELES _ For the second straight outing against one of the
WNBA's elite teams, the Comets found themselves searching in the
second half for ways to come back from a huge deficit.
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the second time in Los Angeles in three years, the Comets
were frustrated by the Sparks, losing 78-65 in their most lopsided
defeat this season.
</P>
<P>
   Their subpar performance Sunday, during which the Comets shot
38.3 percent, came just two nights after rallying from a 17-point
second-half deficit to defeat the Utah Starzz 88-84 in overtime at
Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   With 2:09 left Sunday, after guard Gordana Grubin had raked the
Comets' defense with torrid outside shooting, the Comets trailed
73-55. And this night, there wasn't enough time or solid
performances from anyone in the lineup to pull off another
comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't pretend to be down by 10 points, 11 points, or
whatever, and win every single night,'' said the Comets' Cynthia
Cooper, who had a difficult time putting 20 points on the
scoreboard despite shooting 7-for-14 from the floor. ``You've got
to be up by 15 points and fighting the other teams off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially, you can't expect to come into the Forum and play a
team like the Los Angeles Sparks, be down more than 10 points and
expect to come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just basketball. We did it in Utah. It just didn't work
against Los Angeles. And now we have to figure out why we're in
that position in the first place, then regroup and come back. We
have to settle that problem, if there is a problem, and definitely
get back on the winning track.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks (11-6) have beaten the Comets twice. The first time
was July 16, 1997. That 77-52 defeat stands as the Comets' most
lopsided loss ever.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets (14-3) must face the Sacramento Monarchs (who beat
the Comets this season) and the Sparks twice more each.
</P>
<P>
   But there is precious little time to dwell on that. The Comets,
whose four-game winning streak was snapped Sunday, continue their
road trip tonight at Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury is coming off an 84-76 victory over the Sparks on
Saturday at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets had few triumphant moments at the Forum, to the
delight of the 12,178 on hand. Those moments came in the first
half. Sonja Henning buried a 3-pointer with 2:46 left in the
opening half to give the Comets their biggest lead (35-28).
</P>
<P>
   But they were ahead only 35-33 at halftime. Grubin, who played
sparingly in Houston when the Sparks lost 84-76 on June 22, took
care of that in a hurry. She knocked down a trio of 3s during the
first 6:22 of the second half as the Sparks outscored the Comets
18-4 and went ahead 51-39.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew they had a heck of a player,'' said Comets coach Van
Chancellor. ``She was a factor tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Grubin, 4-for-8 from 3-point range, finished with 15 points. But
she was only part of the wrecking ball that demolished the Comets.
</P>
<P>
   Center Lisa Leslie, the Most Valuable Player of the WNBA
All-Star Game, had 20 points and 12 rebounds. Forward DeLisha
Milton and guard Mwadi Mabika had 12 points apiece to go with nine
and five rebounds, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt they played good all around,'' said Sheryl
Swoopes, who led the Comets with 21 points. ``Their perimeter
players were hitting shots, which didn't allow us to go inside and
help on Lisa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their post players were scoring. And because they were scoring
from outside and inside, it was hard for us to double-team anybody.
They just did a really good job of playing tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor, who was hit with a technical foul midway through the
second half as the Sparks were mounting their most telling
offensive run, had a better description.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Sparks) were just on a mission tonight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Sparks' outstanding and sometimes physical play,
Chancellor said the Comets were their own worst enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball wouldn't go in the basket,'' he said. ``When it won't
go in, you're going to struggle. The ball just would not go in on
our end.''
</P>
<P>
   And on a night when Grubin victimized first Henning, and later
Janeth Arcain outside, and with the Sparks' front-line threesome
having a field day, the Comets' shooting was far from good enough
for a comeback.

SPARKS AT THEIR BEST IN WIN OVER COMETS

 (CORRECTS NEWSPAPER AFFILIATION IN BYLINE) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Facing their toughest back-to-back test yet,
the Los Angeles Sparks responded with arguably their best game of
the season Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   They went on a 14-0 run in the second half to become only the
third team this season to defeat the Houston Comets, 78-65, holding
the defending WNBA champions to their second-lowest output of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Leslie led four Sparks in double-figures with 20 points,
plus 12 rebounds, as the home team wowed a season-high crowd of
12,178 at the Forum that was boosted by a postgame benefit rap
concert.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks (11-6), coming off a tough loss in Phoenix on
Saturday, prevented the seemingly untouchable Comets (14-3) from
developing any real flow. Tina Thompson, one of the awesome
threesome on the Houston squad along with Cynthia Cooper and Sheryl
Swoopes, was 0 for 8 from the floor, due partly to the defensive
work of DeLisha Milton and Leslie.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the best defense I've seen them play since
they've been in the league,'' Houston coach Van Chancellor said.
``The Sparks played extremely well. They lost to Phoenix yesterday.
It looked like they were on a mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Sparks coach Orlando Woolridge agreed with Chancellor's
assessment and was grateful for his praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means a lot to me for him to say that,'' Woolridge said.
``I consider him like a mentor. We did some different things
defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks trailed 35-33 at the break, but Milton ignited a 14-0
run to go ahead 48-37. Swoopes (21 points) broke a five-minute
drought by the Comets, but it didn't shift the momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge step forward,'' said Woolridge, whose team has
won eight of its last 10 games. ``This really proves that we can
play good basketball. Hopefully, this will catapult us to the next
level in the second half (of the season).''

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
AS you have no doubt observed, baseball is not an exact science,
and the day is still distant when it will be run on an honor system
in which the players call their own balls and strikes.
</P>
<P>
   History tells us that umpires rarely lose an argument, but they
are certain to lose the present one. The men in blue have announced
they will walk off the job on the second day of September. They
have avoided the use of the word ``strike'' so as not to violate
their labor agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they will resign from the union and reappear as a
separate and independent corporation. Next, you will be able to
look for them on the Internet, with an initial public offering to
follow.
</P>
<P>
   This absurd rebellion has been scheduled to protest criticisms
the umpires consider unfair and a demand by the commissioner's
office that they get into a zone _ the strike zone _ that will not
vary wildly from game to game, if not pitch to pitch.
</P>
<P>
   In short, they have been asked to be consistent, an affront to
their authority and possibly their sense of being infallible.
</P>
<P>
   But the evidence is not on the side of the umpires. Nor are the
fans, who tend to think of them in the same way they do tax
collectors. If they think of them at all, it means the fans are not
in a happy mood.
</P>
<P>
   The odd thing about this dust-up is that for the first time in
memory, the umpires are not taking a hike over money or working
conditions. If they were, they might attract a certain amount of
sympathy, even though their share of the pie no longer consists of
mere crumbs.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they have a thankless job. Abuse and insults are
routine. Injuries are common. Crowds are seldom more amused than
when an ump gets hit in an important part of his body by a foul
tip.
</P>
<P>
   And their life on the road is slightly less sociable than that
of a guard who escorts a convicted killer to prison. They do not
mingle with the players, fly on the same plane or sleep in the same
hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Umpires,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker once said. ``You can't
live with them, and you can't live without them.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears the baseball ruling class is prepared to try _ the
living without them part. We might not know much about history, or
biology, but the math is simple. This is a big country, and it
seems probable that there are more than 80 people qualified to
umpire big-league ball. The replacements would come from the
minors, or perhaps the colleges and semipro ranks. Some of the new
ones would do all right, and some would not _ the same as the old
ones.
</P>
<P>
   There is usually a connection between winning and losing and the
level of complaints about the umpiring. The Astros won their
seventh in a row Sunday as lefty Mike Hampton shut out the
Cleveland Indians 2-0. There were no tirades about blown calls, and
home-plate umpire Frank Pulli was consistent in calling the low
pitch a foot outside a strike.
</P>
<P>
   Having bumped their Central Division lead over Cincinnati to two
games, the Astros are among the teams not picking any fights with
the arbiters. As a group, they get high grades for class, and they
would have few squawks even if Mr. Magoo were calling the game.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, the umpires have no leverage. They can't count on
public opinion to promote their cause. In the end, they will have
to depend on the fairness and kindness of the owners and the
leadership of the sport. You can see they have a real problem.
</P>
<P>
   But they have chosen to stand on a principle, which is this: We
can't be wrong all the time, but we keep trying. If it is maddening
for the fans watching on television, think how frustrated the
hitters and pitchers are, wondering how elastic that night's strike
zone will be. It is clearly not your grandfather's strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   The umps have been boiling since the spring, when the order went
out to establish a ``standard'' zone. The men in blue do not want
to be dictated to, or reviewed. They are willing to tamper with the
quality of the game to make their point.
</P>
<P>
   Has it come to this _ a labor strike that isn't a strike to
decide how high is up?
</P>
<P>
   Many years ago, an umpire named Jocko Conlan, who was as Irish
as Finian's Rainbow, called a strike on the Phillies' Richie
Ashburn, a career .308 hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where was that pitch?'' snarled Ashburn, in the player's
traditional retort to a call that went against him.
</P>
<P>
   Conlan did not answer, at least, not directly. What he said was:
``OK, you umpire. You call the next pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashburn, startled, never moved the bat as the next one popped
into the catcher's mitt. Over his shoulder, he peeked at Jocko and
said, tentatively, ``Strike?''
</P>
<P>
   Jocko dutifully threw up his right hand and called a strike.
Then he marched out and dusted off home plate. As he did, he looked
up and said, ``Richie, you just had the only chance in the history
of baseball to bat and umpire at the same time. And you blew it!''

ACTIVIST TO SAVE SEATTLE'S CREEKS FINDS AN ALLY IN CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LISA STIFFLER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Cane-wielding but no granny, Nancy Malmgren is a
70-year-old spark plug leading the fight to save Seattle's urban
creeks.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Malmgren has devotedly worked to restore Pipers
Creek, joining with neighborhood volunteers to stock salmon
fingerlings and replant native vegetation along the water's edge.
</P>
<P>
   Now she's getting a big boost from the Seattle Millennium
Project, which has as one of its goals urban creek restoration.
Across the city, residents like Malmgren are working to improve the
streams for fish, fowl and their own children.
</P>
<P>
   As Malmgren strolls the Pipers Creek trail in Carkeek Park in
northwest Seattle, she stops to thank a man for keeping his dog on
a leash _ and out of the stream _ and abandons her cane to fix a
segment of rough-hewn fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could bring every watershed resident to Pipers Creek and
show them this ... '' she says, scanning the babbling brook and
canopy of lush vegetation.
</P>
<P>
   Creek restoration will work, she continues, only if residents
realize that ``what they do upstream is so damned important.''
</P>
<P>
   For Pipers Creek, ``upstream'' covers a lot of territory. Nearly
2,000 acres in northwest Seattle comprise the creek's watershed.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that land is developed, and rain sends water rushing
down the pavement in torrents, carrying pollutants like lawn
pesticides and oil into Pipers Creek.
</P>
<P>
   The force of all the rain water can scour prime fish habitat and
clog waterways such as Pipers with silt.
</P>
<P>
   Preserving urban streams is an age-old problem for the city.
Since logging and development began 147 years ago when settlers
moved from Alki Point across Elliott Bay, the Seattle waterways
have been vulnerable to man-made pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Over-fishing in Pipers Creek began in 1916 and the last spawning
salmon was sighted there in 1927, according to Malmgren.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, an early pioneer family was sickened by
drinking polluted water from a Pipers Creek tributary that now
bears their family name _ Venema.
</P>
<P>
   While it's still not safe for drinking _ or even swimming _
Pipers Creek is making a slow comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Countless hours and dollars have been spent resuscitating the
waterway, and plans are in the works to take the restoration a step
further.
</P>
<P>
   In less than a year, jackhammers will tear up the 11700 block of
Second Avenue Northwest, transforming this ordinary Broadview
street into a tree-lined, meandering country lane.
</P>
<P>
   The project will temporarily disrupt traffic and much of the
street parking will be lost, but nearly all of the block's
residents support the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to improve the street and improve the
environment,'' resident Tom Rosplock said. ``I think there will be
a lot of neighborhoods who will be kind of jealous.''
</P>
<P>
   This unique piece of the city's Millennium Project is a
never-before-tried engineering experiment that could decrease
stormwater runoff and mitigate such adverse impacts on Pipers
Creek.
</P>
<P>
   If it works in northwest Seattle, the city may try the same
approach in other parts of town.
</P>
<P>
   Once narrowed, the block of Second Avenue Northwest will be
lined with sloping ditches called ``swales'' that allow for
increased absorption of stormwater and slower water flow from the
streets to the creeks.
</P>
<P>
   The renovations are expected to take about six months to
complete, and success will be determined in
</P>
<P>
   part from before-and-after measurements of runoff volume and
flow rates.
</P>
<P>
   Diana Gale, director of Seattle Public Utilities, said, ``If it
turns out to be cost-effective ... we're going to be doing more of
these. It's less expensive than putting in underground drainage.''
</P>
<P>
   The city estimates it costs a minimum of $400,000 per block to
add sidewalks and drainage.
</P>
<P>
   A complete renovation _ including curbs, gutters and sidewalks _
costs about $850,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Broadview experiment is expected to cost between $600,000
and $800,000, and while already less expensive than a complete
renovation, the cost of the environmentally friendly street design
is expected to come down as the city learns more about what works.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, improvements are being planned for other neighborhood
watersheds.
</P>
<P>
   The Millennium Project will fund facelifts for creeks in all
four corners of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton, Longfellow and Taylor creeks will be rebuilt to make
it easier for fish to swim up and down the streams.
</P>
<P>
   Native trees also will be planted along banks and detention
ponds created to retain, filter and slowly release stormwater.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Urban Creeks Legacy Program,'' which includes Pipers
Creek improvements, will cost $4.5 million, funded by Seattle
Public Utilities.
</P>
<P>
   While there is much support for creek restoration, even the
movement's most staunch backers say it's an uphill, slow-moving
battle.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the restorations are successful, ``we may not know in
our lifetime,'' said Vivian Phillips, spokeswoman for Seattle Mayor
Paul Schell.
</P>
<P>
   But what's more important is the ``good stewardship''
demonstrated by the improvements.
</P>
<P>
   And Malmgren is the quintessential steward of Pipers Creek,
looking over every aspect of its maintenance and acting as liaison
between wildlife and visitors.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent walk through Carkeek, she paused to tell a shirtless
23-year-old named Huckleberry Palmer the history of Pipers Creek
and recount her efforts to get people involved with the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to get people connected and willing to make changes
in their personal behavior,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Malmgren cannot work at her present pace forever and looks
to the schools and young people to continue her fight for the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get to be 70, you wonder who's going to carry the
torch,'' Malmgren said.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to the young man perched on the fence at the creek's
bank she asks, ``Are you going to carry the torch, Huckleberry?''

LONGWOOD: IT'S AUSTRALIAN FOR VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Somebody at Longwood should plant a plaque in
the stadium floor, inscribed with the message: ``Todd Martin left
his heart here 18 July 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   People don't remember losers very long. But the recollection of
this thoughtful and gentle young man groggily throwing himself in
the path of the Patrick Rafter-engineered Aussie Express _ and
nearly derailing it _ will endure with the 5,342 witnesses who
sweated it out with him for more than three hours in the barbecue
pit that served as a tennis parlor. And with the millions who could
cool it via TV.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter and the Boy Buzzbomb, Lleyton Hewitt, left their mark.
The Aussies also left with a good shot at the Davis Cup, and once
again Longwood Cricket Club became an Australian colony. Nine times
Australian teams have come to town to play Davis Cup, and they're
9-0.
</P>
<P>
   Genuine Aussies were on view once more, shepherded by captain
John Newcombe and coach Tony Roche, relics of an era when the boys
from Oz scorched Longwood earth and plundered all the prizes,
either in the US Doubles of amateur days or the US Pro. It's been a
long time since the right stuff from Down Under appeared in the
Bean. Rod Laver, a 1975 quarterfinalist in the US Pro which he'd
won five times, was their last hurrah-er.
</P>
<P>
   Even more time had passed since a US team was in the Cup fight
here. Forty-two years ago the United States won an insignificant
early round joust with Brazil. It made no splash, had no buzz.
Governor Foster Furcolo, overseeing the draw at the State House,
asked, ``Which team is Seixas on?'' Seixas was the No. 1 American
and a Wimbledon champ.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, though, the world was tuned in. So was Boston.
Tickets went fast. Even the mayor, Tom Menino, showed up. He met
his wife, the fair Angela, on a tennis court, but sheepishly
admitted he's regressed to golf.
</P>
<P>
   It was Australia, and the 100th year of the silver grail called
the Davis Cup, which had been launched as a world wanderer at
Longwood in 1900. The occasion was hot, though not as torrid as the
weather. According to the recording of Kool &AMP; the Gang played at
the outset, it was a ``Celebration,'' and the Harvard band made
sure nobody forgot it.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was the Australians' summer day in every respect, not
only a century for Dwight Davis's big bauble that the tourists
covet but a ``century'' in their parlance: a 100-degree day, common
to their continent. Actually a record 102 was posted _ dehydrating
enough to induce cramps even in seated customers _ and 130 on the
playground surface where Todd Martin struggled, after a pre-match
IV cocktail, to keep his country's last gasp going.
</P>
<P>
   But with all the ink and TV, red-white-and-blue bunting and
Aussie rooters war-painted in green and gold, the weekend will
linger for years with a huge question mark attached. Across the
planet, wherever there is interest in tennis, puzzled and confused
aficionados will ask of the 4-1 Aussie victory: What would have
happened if the Americans had put their best feet forward _ the
tootsies inhabiting Pete Sampras's sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   We'll never know. However, unfortunately Martin will be known as
the gutsy guy who shouldn't have played. He lost to Hewitt, an
18-year-old, in the opener, then Rafter, when the logical choice
was the world's main man, Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras almost did make it into the singles act, and there was
much talk around Longwood Saturday night and Sunday morning of an
American flim-flam that would have put him in against Rafter. US
captain Tom Gullikson had said on TV that Sampras might be
substituted because Martin was exhausted. That was possible under
the rules only if Martin were unfit.
</P>
<P>
   US team physician, David Altchek, said he wasn't fit, and
Gullikson summoned Sampras. But the neutral doctor empowered by the
International Tennis Federation, Richard Paul, a Bostonian, felt,
``Todd was able. He played over three hours, and almost won,
right?''
</P>
<P>
   Gullikson, who obviously would have relished Sampras as his
reliever, his stopper, denied flim-flammery, and I accept. Martin
didn't feel sharp, but he wanted to play.
</P>
<P>
   Clumsy and uncoordinated as a kid sprouting out of his clothes,
Martin became the loftiest to play tennis for his country at 6 feet
6 inches. He had to work incredibly hard to make his gangling frame
behave in the manner of a world-class player. And he was pleased,
not proud _ ``I was always taught pride was a sin'' _ to play Davis
Cup whenever asked.
</P>
<P>
   Though in and out of rehab for various injuries all year, Martin
never failed to give his all-plus. He did that again Sunday,
gamely. It wasn't enough. Leading Rafter, 4-2, in the fifth set, he
was out on his unsteady feet. He could scrape up only three more
points as the dauntless Rafter came off the burning asphalt floor
with the moxie that won him two US Opens _ and his last 11 five-set
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter's resurgent 4-6, 5-7, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 win was very good
news to everybody in the Outback town of Mt. Isa, Queensland, where
he grew up on a gritty red court of crushed ant hills. Most folks
at home could catch the fifth set on the telly as they were arising
to go to work this morning.
</P>
<P>
   So Australia was triumphant over the United States in a series
that was historic in its nature and setting _ and bewildering to
everybody including captain Newcombe, who thought it was Christmas
when he learned Sampras wouldn't do singles. No guarantee, of
course, that Pete would have done any better against Rafter or
Hewitt, the kid who made the finest debut by an Aussie juvenile
since 19-year-old Kenny Rosewall beat the aforementioned Vic Seixas
to clinch the Cup over the US 46 years ago. But you suspect he
would.
</P>
<P>
   Gullikson might have been luckier if two medical opinions had
coincided. He could have had Sampras, with Jim Courier awaiting
another hero's opportunity in the fifth. But the chance to insert
Sampras was days past. Courier is still waiting, and we are left
dangling forever, wondering why the US couldn't get its act
together.

GOP DEFECTION (Undated) - When U.S. Sen. Bob Smith, a rock-ribbed
Republican all his life, decided last week to abandon his party
because he thought it was too ``squishy'' on right-wing causes, the
Republican National Committee sent him a note loaded with
backhanded requests to reconsider. ``I hope you do not confuse the
success of our shared message with your own failure as its
messenger,'' Jim Nicholson, national committee chairman, wrote to
Smith, a struggling presidential candidate from New Hampshire. ``It
would be tragic for your decades of work in the conservative
movement to be undone by a shortsighted decision.'' While few GOP
leaders expressed grief over Smith's decision to jump to an
undetermined third party, political analysts couldn't help but
debate the implications. To many, Smith's exit offered the best
evidence yet that moderate Republicans, Christian conservatives and
so-called patriot groups are becoming uncomfortable with each other
inside the GOP tent erected by Ronald Reagan. By RICK MONTGOMERY.

   AMUSEMENTPARK-ACCIDENT (KANSAS CITY, Mo.) For 2 hours Saturday
night, two girls sat calmly, resting on their backs and looking
straight up like astronauts in a capsule, while rescuers worked to
free them from a derailed roller coaster at Worlds of Fun. Two cars
of the Orient Express coaster, weighing a combined 5,000 pounds,
hung precariously from the track like pendants, connected to each
other and the rest of the train only by couplers and pins that were
not intended to carry such a load. About 35 feet below were a
brush-covered hill and a small creek. By MATT CAMPBELL and BRIAN

RED SOX SURVIVE ACE IN HOLE 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-MARLINS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Now Red Sox Nation knows that a bad outing by Pedro
Martinez is not necessarily the end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   One had every reason to think that way Sunday at Fenway Park,
where the Florida Marlins pounded Martinez for nine runs and 12
hits in less than four innings. But the Red Sox rallied from 2-0,
5-3, and 9-5 deficits and somehow came up with an 11-9 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off his win in the All-Star Game, Martinez needed help to
escape this game without a loss. He got it in all sorts of ways.
The Red Sox had 12 hits, including home runs by Jason Varitek and
Damon Buford, five doubles, and a decisive two-run triple by John
Valentin that highlighted a three-run rally in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   It was 90-plus degrees on the field and there were mysterious
wind currents that lifted balls to the Wall in left and to the
deepest part of the park in center. The Sox know better than their
National League foes how to play under such conditions. In center,
Buford made diving catches in the seventh that twice carried him
face first into the wall. Valentin's triple in the eighth,
following a double by Trot Nixon and a walk to Jose Offerman, took
off like a rocket, sailed over the head of center fielder Preston
Wilson, who was playing shallow, and reached the wall about 400
feet away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like the old days before they built the 600 Club,''
said Sox pitching coach Joe Kerrigan. ``By that I mean it played
like a real small park today. It was like a hot-air balloon today.
Once it got into the air it went forever and ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentin felt the same way. All he wanted to do was hit the ball
hard. Because he did he wound up with his first triple of the year.
He went 3 for 4 with four runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   After four innings the Marlins were on cloud nine. Despite a
weak outing by starter Ryan Dempster, they had pounded Martinez.
Two errors didn't help Martinez, and he was charged with seven
earned runs, which pushed his ERA from from 2.10 to 2.51.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel comfortable in my mechanics, my arm or my
body,'' he said. ``My pitches weren't working. My location was
awful. So little pitching (surrounding the All-Star break) probably
didn't work out so well for me. Hopefully, I will be back next
outing.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez gave up two runs in the first and three more in the
third. The Marlins were relentless, scoring four more in the fourth
off the Boston ace.
</P>
<P>
   In the first, Alex Gonzalez reached on an error, Bruce Aven
doubled to left, and Kevin Millar singled, scoring Gonzalez. Mark
Kotsay's sacrifice fly added another run.
</P>
<P>
   Boston took the lead in the second on a two-run blast by Jason
Varitek and a solo shot by Buford.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, Martinez gave up a double to Luis Castillo and a
single to Gonzalez, putting runners on first and third. Aven
grounded to short, and a quick throw home set up a rundown. But
Castillo was able to score when Varitek's throw to third hit him in
the back. A Millar single and a Wilson double added two more runs.
</P>
<P>
   Boston tied it in its half on a single by Offerman, doubles by
Valentin and Brian Daubach, and a sacrifice fly by Nomar
Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   But Martinez crumbled again. Nine Marlins went to the plate in
the fourth, after which Florida led, 9-5.
</P>
<P>
   Things looked bleak to the sellout crowd of 30,388.
</P>
<P>
   But while relievers Rich Garces, Derek Lowe, and Tim Wakefield
were shutting down the Marlins, Red Sox bats pecked away at Florida
pitching. The Sox scored five times after two were out. Florida
issued six walks, and four of them scored. That was asking for
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox scored two runs in the fourth after two were out. Nixon
walked and the runs scored on doubles by Offerman and Valentin to
cut the defict to 9-7. In the sixth, Nixon walked and scored
Boston's eighth run on a Valentin sacrifice fly. After that the Red
Sox victory seemed inevitable. Then came the heroics in the eighth.

GOP DEFECTION REFLECTS PARTY DIVISIONS, ANALYSTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK MONTGOMERY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When U.S. Sen. Bob Smith, a rock-ribbed Republican all his life,
decided last week to abandon his party because he thought it was
too ``squishy'' on right-wing causes, the Republican National
Committee sent him a note loaded with backhanded requests to
reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope you do not confuse the success of our shared message
with your own failure as its messenger,'' Jim Nicholson, national
committee chairman, wrote to Smith, a struggling presidential
candidate from New Hampshire. ``It would be tragic for your decades
of work in the conservative movement to be undone by a shortsighted
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   While few GOP leaders expressed grief over Smith's decision to
jump to an undetermined third party, political analysts couldn't
help but debate the implications.
</P>
<P>
   To many, Smith's exit offered the best evidence yet that
moderate Republicans, Christian conservatives and so-called patriot
groups are becoming uncomfortable with each other inside the GOP
tent erected by Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reflects these widening divisions within the party and the
fractioning of the right wing,'' said Stuart Rothenberg, editor of
a Washington newsletter. ``There are some Republicans still
fighting wars over `Murphy Brown' and the godless communists. They
think it's 1986. And that's making the party establishment
uneasy.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 58, told reporters he may seek the presidential
nomination of the U.S. Taxpayers Party, which is dedicated to
outlawing abortion, protecting gun owners and preserving national
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We...gratefully acknowledge the blessing of the Lord God as
Creator, Preserver and Ruler of the Universe and of this Nation,''
the party's platform reads. ``We say `No' to the so-called New
World Order and `Yes!' to the autonomy of these United States of
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Hopper of St. Louis, the party's national secretary, said
its Web site fielded 30,000 hits in the two days after Smith's
announcement. ``That's all I'm doing _ answering e-mail,'' she
said. ``People are saying they're fed up with the Republican Party,
and if Smith comes to our party, so will they. It's been building
for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   If GOP pollsters are nervous, many aren't letting on. As they
size up the overwhelming support within Republican ranks for the
more centrist Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, some strategists even
whisper that with each extremist who leaves, the GOP can refine its
image, and even win over moderate Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   A few of Bush's rivals for the Republican nomination, however,
were quick to praise Smith _ the first GOP senator to bolt his
party since 1952.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative commentator Patrick Buchanan hinted that he, too,
might seek a third-party nomination. ``The Republican establishment
is virtually fixing this election'' in favor of Bush, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, campaigning in Iowa, said, ``It's a bad omen for
the GOP when a solid Reagan conservative like Bob Smith would even
consider leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   And Dan Quayle wondered whether social conservatives ``will
sacrifice principle for electability'' by boarding the Bush
bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who's Republican needs to do a reality check,'' said
GOP presidential candidate and Christian activist Gary Bauer. ``Bob
Smith has been a Reagan Republican his entire career. If he's
feeling unwelcomed in the party, others are as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We win elections when we've got a clear, conservative message.
Look at the 1980s.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, say Republican strategists, is that this is now _
the end of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   It was a decade when Bill Clinton won two terms by casting
himself as a moderate and by appealing to women voters turned off
by the rhetoric of the far right. Even in Kansas' conservative 3rd
District, Democrat Dennis Moore prevailed last year over the
Republican incumbent Vince Snowbarger, a social conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a lot of women, Republicans seemed to be always taking a
harsh tone in communicating their message,'' said Bill Dalbec of
Wirthlin Worldwide, a GOP polling firm. ``It came off as mean.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the term ``conservative,'' so widely understood in
the Reagan years, now means different things to different people,
Dalbec said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who focus on abortion and social conservatism have
little in common with the economic conservatives. And the old
strong-defense wing of the party has really dropped off lately....
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all of society has become more inward-looking since
the end of the Cold War, when we had that one big unifying
threat,'' Dalbec said.
</P>
<P>
   One result, said former U.S. Rep. Steve Gunderson of Wisconsin,
is that ``everyone's searching for a political niche. Republicans
are fighting Democrats for the broad center. Democrats call it
center-left, we call it center-right.''
</P>
<P>
   Gunderson is executive director of the Republican Mainstream
Partnership, a coalition that would rather not even discuss
abortion than see it and other religious issues split the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be pro-choice any more than we want to
promote a pro-life position,'' he said. Candidate Bush has signaled
similar sentiments, although the GOP officially backs an
anti-abortion platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would suggest that Ronald Reagan was successful in holding
social conservatives in his rhetoric when some of their causes were
never a part of his political mission,'' Gunderson said. ``He
talked to the pro-life movement on the telephone; he never went to
their meetings. He was acutely aware of how to hold a conservative
coalition together.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the GOP's once-sprawling tent now shows signs of
splitting at both ends. Lowell Wiecker of Connecticut, a maverick
Republican with liberal views on social issues during three terms
in the U.S. Senate, reportedly is weighing ideas of running for
president on the Reform Party ticket in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Weicker concedes, ``It's a long shot.''
</P>
<P>
   And Smith, whose presidential bid was pulling the support of
only 1 percent of Republicans in his home state, isn't apt to get
much more attention from here on, party leaders say.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``if the Republican leadership actually believes that
this splintering on the fringes doesn't matter, they're smoking
something,'' said Mike Lux, head of political action for the People
for the American Way, a liberal counter to the Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the active Republicans _ the primary voters _
most are very conservative. Thirty percent say they're religious
conservatives. If you start to erode that much of your party's
vote, you're in deep trouble,'' Lux said. ``It puts Bush in a box.
While he tries to move to the center, he's constantly looking over
his shoulder to the right.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's strong poll numbers and record-breaking campaign coffers
suggest to political analyst Rothenberg that, so far, most
conservatives don't mind if he upsets the Reagan tent. So long as
they reclaim the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way politics has worked in the '90s, you find someone from
the opposing party to unite you,'' Rothenberg said. ``Republicans
will get united by focusing on Bill Clinton, just as Newt Gingrich
had a way of uniting Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the GOP this election's going to be about Bill Clinton, Al
Gore and Hillary Clinton running in New York. It sure isn't going
to be about Bob Smith.''

US HOME-COOKED IN DAVIS CUP 
</HEADLINE>
 CUP-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ What began in folly ended as an epic.
</P>
<P>
   As noon turned from scorcher to inferno Sunday, this Davis Cup
match quickly moved from a modern-day fable of crying wolf to a
surreal Twilight Zone scene of American Todd Martin waiting by the
Australian locker room to convince Aussie captain John Newcombe
that he was indeed ill, and finally into the medical textbooks for
a definitive list of the symptoms of heat exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, only 20 minutes before the match was to begin,
Australian Patrick Rafter was fuming. ``I got fed up. I really have
to know who the hell I'm going to play,'' said Rafter, `` . . .
whether it was going to be Pete (Sampras) or Todd.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, for 3 hours and 14 minutes in an air temperature of 102
degrees and asphalt temperature of 130, Martin versus Rafter moved
into the annals of tennis' greatest moments, into the epic list of
the most courageous matches of any sport.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter and Australia, ultimately would win, as Rafter pulled
himself up from losing the first two sets and then from an 0-3
abyss and twice being down a break in the fifth set, to take the
deciding match, 4-6, 5-7, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4. Australia had not beaten
the Americans in a Davis Cup match in the US since the 1973 finals,
when the Aussies took the Cup from the US, 5-0, in Cleveland.
Lleyton Hewitt of Australia defeated Alex O'Brien, 7-5, 6-4, in the
final singles match.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' said Rafter, the world's No. 2 player, ``was one of
the most memorable occasions I've ever had in my career.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I know why Patrick Rafter has won the US Open twice,''
said US captain Tom Gullikson of Rafter's 11th consecutive five-set
victory, the mark of the truest champion. ``When his back was to
the wall, he made every return.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, meanwhile, stepped onto the court at Longwood Cricket
Club so woozy that Gullikson asked him after only five games if he
wanted to default. Martin had stepped on that court so pale and wan
that even Rafter, his opponent, said ``I saw him out there and he
didn't look great; he looked pale.'' Martin had stepped onto that
court having been pumped with intravenous fluids only moments
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Even more, Martin had stepped onto that court after a sharp
disagreement between two doctors concerning whether he was
suffering the effects of heat exhaustion and might be endangering
himself by playing in such heat. David Altchek, the US team doctor
(and New York Mets physician), said Martin clearly was displaying
the symptoms of heat exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   But a neutral doctor called in by Stefan Fronsson of Sweden, the
umpire for the weekend's matches, came to an opposite conclusion
after examining Martin an hour or so before the match and after
Martin was forced to cut short his practice time. Dr. G. Richard
Paul of Boston (and a member at Longwood) said after his decision
that Martin was fit to play. ``You have to be ethical about it,''
he said. ``(Martin) proved he could play.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul said he was unaware Altchek had initiated IV treatment so
Martin could take to the court. Martin said he could not remember
how extensive Paul's examination of him was, or any details of it;
Gullikson, while conceding that he was not present for the entire
examination, said, ``I don't think it was really a exam. He asked
(Martin) a few questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Altchek, though, said he was present for the entire procedure,
and the US team doctor was perturbed at the extent of Paul's
examination of Martin. ``It wasn't an examination,'' said Altchek
bluntly. ``He asked Todd, `How are you feeling; do you feel like
you can go out there and function?' and Todd said, `No. In the
current state I am in, I don't think I can function.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Even more, the US team doctor went on, Paul initially seemed to
agree with Martin's self-description and Altchek's diagnosis.
(``Put it this way, he did not disagree with me in my presence.'')
But the US team doctor said he then left after the examination to
make a phone call and never was told by Paul that it was his
opinion Martin could play. ``There seemed to be a general agreement
(when the two doctors were in the room with Martin),'' said
Altchek, ``that Todd was not fit to play.''
</P>
<P>
   This all played against the backdrop of suggestions made
Saturday evening by Gullikson that Martin was not totally fit and
was mulling over whether Pete Sampras, the world's best player,
might have to take Martin's spot against Rafter.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as early as Thursday it was the Australians who first
raised the possibility that Sampras _ who had steadfastly said he
would play only doubles _ might be playing singles Sunday if the US
team were down after the first three matches. Martin, Newcombe said
then, ``might get a sore shoulder or something'' so Sampras could
play.
</P>
<P>
   And when media reports reached him of what Gullikson _ his US
counterpart _ was considering, ``I didn't know what was going on in
that locker room,'' said Newcombe. The Aussie captain suspected
chicanery.
</P>
<P>
   But, Gullikson and Martin said, the two had discussed Martin's
condition Saturday night, and both agreed Martin would play.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Saturday) night, we discussed how I felt, and I said I felt
fine,'' said Martin. ``I told him in fact that I would be better
prepared since I had a chance to experience the heat once, and I
acclimatized myself a little bit.'' Both captain and player agreed
Martin would take the court.
</P>
<P>
   But after hitting practice balls with Jim Courier Sunday
morning, ``I didn't have my bearings,'' said Martin, who then went
to the locker room, where he sat down ``for about five minutes.
Unfortunately, I was sitting right in front of a mirror and saw how
I looked. I didn't like that, and I didn't like the way I felt,
especially after five minutes of rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin said he panicked because Sampras _ his possible
replacement _ was back in his Boston hotel room and ``we only had
about half an hour before Tom had to put in his lineup for the
day.'' Indeed, said Gullikson, ``if we were going to cheat, Pete
already would have been here and would have hit and would have had
eight rackets strung. I can tell you I didn't call Sampras until
11:30 (in the morning).''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be joking,'' said Sampras to his captain when
Gullikson told him to rush over to Longwood. Sampras thought the
issue had been decided Saturday night and he would not be playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel like I was fit to play,'' said Martin, even
after Paul's decision. ``I also felt I was putting myself at a fair
bit of risk'' by taking the court in such heat. So much so that
Martin waited by the Australian locker room for Newcombe so the
Aussie captain could see for himself. But Martin and Newcombe never
saw each other then.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter, for his part, believed Martin was ill when he saw Martin
take the court and because, ``you're not going to see a better
sportsman in the world than Todd, and I have a lot of respect for
Todd. I never once saw Todd trying to pull one over on me. I saw
him out on the court and he didn't look great.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, what happened next was amazing. Martin totally dominated
Rafter in the first two sets, even as he looked so woozy that
Gullikson asked if he wanted to retire during the switchover after
the fifth game of the first set. ``I knew I was in trouble,'' said
Rafter.
</P>
<P>
   All the bizarre circumstances ``made this a hard match for Pat
to play,'' said Newcombe. ``Todd comes out, and obviously he's just
going for everything and jumping on Pat's second serve, and that
just threw Pat wide out of kilter. Pat is thinking, `I'm playing
somebody I should beat, but I can't get any rhythm in the match,
and Todd is playing great and serving great. Is he going to fall
over or not?' '' Literally.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at the end of the first set, Newcombe went on, ``Pat said
to me, `Can you mention to the umpire that Todd is taking a bit of
extra time on the change of ends?' He says, `I know he's sick, but
I think we should mention it.' They're good friends and, it was on
Pat's mind that Todd was sick, but two hours later, the guy
(Martin) was still there.''
</P>
<P>
   And about to pull off one of the more improbable and most
emotional wins in US Davis Cup play. In the fifth set, as the
Harvard band played, ``You're a Grand Old Flag'' and the US fans
were in a frenzy, Martin had Rafter 3-0, and after Rafter
recovered, Martin again broke the Aussie and was serving at 4-2.
The impossible was coming true.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very excited,'' said Martin, ``not that I could move and
show it.''
</P>
<P>
   But then _ so suddenly _ the serve that had served him so well
this far into the match deserted Martin. ``I felt like I lost my
serve a little bit, the rhythm on it. I missed a few more first
serves, and the first serves I made, Pat made good returns on
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Rafter was gambling, trying shots he seldom attempts.
``I played a couple of shots in that game that really weren't my
style, but I came up with then,'' said Rafter, mentioning ``a
forehand down the line that I don't particularly feel comfortable
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, just as suddenly, it was over, Rafter taking the final
four games. Martin grabbed Rafter's hand at the end and said,
``Pat, I'm sorry how all this went. I had to have an IV to play.''
Then Martin sat down on the US bench, tearful.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter was so drained by the whole day that an hour later he was
gimpily walking over the soft grass courts down near the clubhouse.
``I went for a walk after,'' said the Aussie, ``and I was in a lot
of trouble. I think I lost a lot of fluid out there.''

WHILE RESCUERS LABORED, GIRLS STRANDED ON RIDE STAYED CALM 
</HEADLINE>
 PARK-ACCIDENT-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATT CAMPBELL and BRIAN BURNES  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ For 2 hours Saturday night, two girls sat
calmly, resting on their backs and looking straight up like
astronauts in a capsule, while rescuers worked to free them from a
derailed roller coaster at Worlds of Fun.
</P>
<P>
   Two cars of the Orient Express coaster, weighing a combined
5,000 pounds, hung precariously from the track like pendants,
connected to each other and the rest of the train only by couplers
and pins that were not intended to carry such a load.
</P>
<P>
   About 35 feet below were a brush-covered hill and a small creek.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were so quiet, I think they were in shock more than
anything,'' Kansas City Fire Department Battalion Chief Tommy
Walker said of the girls. ``They were very cooperative. The girls
themselves actually assisted in the rescue more than anyone else
because they were so calm. There wasn't any screaming, crying or
hysterics.''
</P>
<P>
   Park officials declined to release the names of any of those on
the ride. Kansas City police had not completed their report on the
incident and also would release no names.
</P>
<P>
   The last two cars of the seven-car Orient Express train derailed
about 9:30 p.m. just as the train was decelerating from its trip
and approaching the loading platform.
</P>
<P>
   Two other persons in the last car along with the girls were
either thrown from the ride or elected to drop to the hillside
below. Accounts of Fire Department and park officials differ.
</P>
<P>
   The derailment automatically shut down the ride, which stalled a
second train in the middle and incline on the ride's first hill.
Riders in those cars climbed down a set of maintenance stairs.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, 13 persons from both trains were observed or treated
at five area hospitals and were released by early Sunday without
serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can assure you all of us at Worlds of Fun are saddened by
this accident,'' said Daniel Keller, vice president and general
manager of the theme park. ``All our rides are inspected daily to
ensure the safety of our guests. The Orient Express trains,
machinery and track had routinely been inspected Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   The derailed cars were left in place, still dangling from the
track, until investigators can inspect them. Keller said the park
would conduct its own internal investigation with assistance from
the state fire marshal's office.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Orient Express nor any other ride at Worlds of Fun
is inspected by any governmental agency. Missouri is one of 12
states that have no inspection regulations for permanent amusement
parks.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government used to inspect parks but quit in the
late 1970s, saying it should be the responsibility of the states.
</P>
<P>
   The problem apparently was a mechanical one, Keller said, but it
is not yet clear whether the track or the train was defective.
</P>
<P>
   Each car of the coaster carries four passengers, but there were
no passengers in the sixth car when the accident occurred. Fourteen
passengers in the front five cars had to walk to safety.
</P>
<P>
   But the two girls in the forward seats of the seventh car had to
wait until emergency officials stabilized the situation before
freeing them.
</P>
<P>
   The last two cars were hanging from a banked part of the track
that rises out of a depression, just before a flat section that
enters the loading platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were afraid that if we didn't secure the entire train of
cars that it could actually slide back down the hill and take the
(other) cars with it, and some of our rescuers,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also were concerned initially that other passengers
may have been ejected and lying injured in the rough terrain below.
A Fire Department team arrived with portable generators and lights.
</P>
<P>
   Worlds of Fun engineers with detailed knowledge of the Orient
Express guided firefighters as they hooked steel cables to the
undercarriage of the train to secure it. The sixth car was tethered
to the track and the seventh car was cabled to it. The operation
took more than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   All the while the two girls, named Rachel and Robin and
described as being in their early teens, were instructed to sit
still so as not to make the cars sway and further strain the
tenuous coupling.
</P>
<P>
   As Walker watched from the ground, Firefighter Rick Carper
climbed a 50-foot ladder whose top rested against the track. Capt.
Todd Ackerson descended on a rope about 15 feet from the track to
the girls.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers placed snap-on safety harnesses, attached to ropes,
around the girls. Then they released the ride's U-shaped harnesses
that fit over the girls' shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   The girls were then led down the fully extended ladder, which
bowed with the weight.
</P>
<P>
   The older girl, while she was being carried up the hill on a
spine board as a precaution, commented good-naturedly to
firefighters:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm never riding this ride again. This sucks.''
</P>
<P>
   Just two weeks ago Walker, the Fire Department's high-angle
rescue coordinator and a shift safety officer, completed an intense
training course on rope rescues along with one of the fire
companies that responded to the Worlds of Fun accident.
</P>
<P>
   Walker praised the cooperation of Worlds of Fun officials
throughout the rescue effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was without a doubt the most coordinated rescue that I've
ever participated in,'' the 24-year veteran said.
</P>
<P>
   Keller said the 19-year-old Orient Express, which can reach
speeds of 65 mph, has had an excellent safety record. He said he
was unaware of any other derailments involving Orient Express-type
coasters.
</P>
<P>
   But in June 1987, one of the coaster's trains struck another
one, injuring nine persons and leaving some passengers stranded
above ground for hours.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Saturday, one train on the Orient Express reportedly
stalled temporarily, but Keller said that was unrelated to the
derailment.
</P>
<P>
   Worlds of Fun was open for business Sunday and will remain open,
although the Orient Express has been shut down until officials
figure out what went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with Arrow Development Corp. of Mountain View, Calif.,
which produced the Orient Express, could not be reached Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Things were back to normal at the park Sunday, although guards
stood outside the closed gate to the Orient Express, and the Mamba
roller coaster was shut down for much of the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Some park-goers said they hadn't heard of the accident. Still
others said they had heard, but that the news hadn't discouraged
them from coming out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd ride the Orient Express if it was open today,'' said
Brandon Davidson, 17, of Independence.
</P>
<P>
   Others shared his sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've ridden the Orient Express almost every year for the past
six years,'' said Donna Engle of Kansas City. ``They'll just test
and re-test it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't bother us,'' said Beckie McGovern of Lawrence.
``It's our son's birthday, so we knew we'd have to come here today.
I just figure the rides are safe or they wouldn't let us ride them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge liability there.''
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Sandoval of Lenexa, who rode the Timber Wolf on Sunday
morning with his wife, Margaret, admitted to wondering about the
safety of the ride. ``The older the park gets the more you think
about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Margaret added, ``We'll be on every ride that's open
today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not afraid of your roller coaster, I'm afraid of your
interstates,'' said Nick Nelson, one of perhaps 30 members of the
King of Kings Lutheran Church of Omaha, Neb., who were finishing up
a three-day mission trip in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did pray for safety in the van coming over here,'' Roger
Theimer, a King of Kings children's pastor, added, smiling.

FRENCHMAN'S COLLAPSE FUELS SCOT'S COMEBACK 
</HEADLINE>
 OPEN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   CARNOUSTIE, Scotland _ The light rains were splattering down on
the lush acreage of the Carnoustie Golf Club in Sunday's final
round of the 128th British Open, and a relatively obscure Frenchman
named Jean Van de Velde apparently had the cherished claret jug in
hand. Then a second shot hit the grandstands on the 18th hole, a
third went into the waters of the Barrie burn, a fifth found a
trap, and before you could say triple bogey, he had one.
</P>
<P>
   That put Van de Velde (77) at 6-over par 290 into a playoff with
Justin Leonard (72), who earlier had found the waters of the Barrie
burn, and Paul Lawrie (67) of nearby Aberdeen, whose round was the
day's lowest by two strokes. Lawrie then sent all of County Angus,
and all of Scotland, into ecstasy, as if to say the restoration of
a parliamentary form of government after more than 300 years was
merely prelude.
</P>
<P>
   After backing away from the hugest putt of his life on No. 17 in
the playoff, Lawrie calmly sank it. He was 10 shots behind Van de
Velde when the round started in the gloom. Leonard had come from
five shots back to win two years ago at Royal Troon, and that was
the last time that had happened since James Barnes in 1925. Ten
back? Forget it. ``We gave the world porridge, drunkards, and
golf,'' wrote Graham Spiers a week ago in Scotland on Sunday, ``Yet
a Scot has won the Open only once in 69 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Move aside Tommy Armour, who won the first Open Championship
contested at Carnoustie in 1931. You've got company. ``I'm a local
boy,'' said Lawrie as he was handed the claret jug on the 18th
green. You can only guess what might be poured into it up the road
in Aberdeen. ``I may buy a new house,'' said Lawrie, ``but it will
be in Aberdeen. I imagine the phone is red-hot up there, but I hope
my wife is able to put our son to bed.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a tournament Van de Velde had in his pocket for the
better part of three days. Then he did a Sam Snead impression on
the 18th. Snead had the US Open practically won in 1939 at
Philadelpia CC, but an 8 on the final hole did him in, when a 7
would have put him in a playoff. This time Van de Velde, who was in
line to become the first Frenchman to win the game's oldest major
championship since Arnaud Massy at Hoylake in 1907, saw it go by
the boards.
</P>
<P>
   Van de Velde took a triple bogey on the hole, hitting his third
shot into the grandstands. It caromed out, but he hit his fourth
into the burn and managed a one-putt 7. ``There's no easy tee
shot,'' he said. ``Even being three ahead, what do you do? Do you
hit a 5-iron down the left, or do you hit something down the right,
or do you try to go as far up as you can?
</P>
<P>
   ``I took that option, I knew all I needed was a 5. That was it.
I drove the ball down the right, really down the right. I didn't
hit a good shot. I was lucky. I missed the creek there, the burn on
the right side. As I came over, the ball was fantastic. The only
thing I had was 185 to 189 to carry the water. The only thing you
didn't want was to hit it left.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the option was, `Do you hit a wedge down the left side and
then pitch it on the green and two-putt it? . . . Or do you you hit
a shot over there and try to move forward. I took my 2-iron and
thought, `You're gonna hit it down there. Either you're on the
green or just on the right in the bunker.' I pushed it a little.
</P>
<P>
   ``It carried the water, hit the grandstand, came back, landed
off the rocks. I would have been better in the water, because I
would have had to drop it somewhere, and if I had a good angle then
two-putted, I'd have gotten away with it. It came back and I had a
bad lie. I couldn't go backwards. I don't think I could have done
anything. I'm glad I made up-and-down for 7, because at least I
played another four holes.''
</P>
<P>
   Van de Velde struggled through the playoff, starting off double
bogey/bogey. This put him 6 over in a three-hole stretch. After
all, this was Carnoustie's fifth British Open and the year Armour
won the first all Jose Jurado had to do was finish 4-5 to win. Nine
shots. He went 6-5 and finished second.
</P>
<P>
   ``As bad as I feel,'' said Leonard, ``he feels worse. It had to
be a sick feeling for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrie put in a birdie/birdie finish in this unique four-hole
playoff format first put into play when Mark Calcavecchia defeated
Wayne Grady and Greg Norman at Royal Troon a decade ago. Lawrie was
a qualifier, making it through the Sunday and Monday rounds at
Downfield in Dundee. After a bogey on the 13th, things looked
bleak.
</P>
<P>
   Then Lawrie, who had won twice on the European PGA Tour in seven
years, birdied the 14th in regulation when he pitched to within 4
feet on the par 5, and the agonizing 459-yard 17th when he hit a
6-iron to 25 feet and holed it. ``I think the way the course was
set up, I would have to say it's the best round of golf I've ever
played,'' he said. ``To shoot 4 under par around here, even with no
wind, is just lovely.''

LOSS WEIGHS HEAVILY ON VAUGHN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Mo Vaughn sat in a chair in front of his
cubicle in the Anaheim Angels clubhouse Sunday night and took the
blame for the 6-3 loss to the San Diego Padres.
</P>
<P>
   Then he took the blame for Saturday's loss to the Dodgers. And
what the heck, blame him for Friday's loss to the Dodgers, too, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I blame it on myself, that's how I look at it,'' said Vaughn,
who went 0 for 4 Sunday. ``I take the blame for the lapses we've
had the last three days. I've got to do my job, I've got to do
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn stranded five of six baserunners during his five plate
appearances, the only run scoring on his first-inning sacrifice
fly. He's had one hit in the past three games and the Angels have
scored seven runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Leadoff hitter) Darin Erstad's getting on, (No. 2 hitter)
Randy Velarde's hitting the ball, and I'm making outs,'' Vaughn
said. ``I'll take the blame, but I'll change it. I got balls I
could handle, but I didn't handle them. I'm here to produce offense
and I'm not producing.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Vaughn was a little hard on himself. After all, he
can't pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Mike Fyhrie (0-2), making his third major-league
start, gave up four runs and nine hits in five-plus innings. Ben
Davis and John Vander Wal each homered off Fyhrie, but the hit that
hurt the most was No. 9 hitter Damian Jackson's two-out, two-run
single on a 1-2 pitch in the second inning that erased a 1-0 Angels
lead and gave the Padres the lead for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pitch ran back over the plate,'' said Fyhrie, whose days
with the club might be numbered. ``I tried to come inside, but I
didn't get it in there. It's your pitcher's nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   However, it seemed to delight most of the 37,697 at Edison
Field. The crowd cheered loudly every time the Padres did something
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm on the road,'' Vaughn said. ``And it was like
being on the road the last series (against the Dodgers), too. I
don't understand it. I don't like it at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I maintain this team is good enough to be in first place.
Until that happens, you've got to make your own attitude around
here. When you're in first place, you'll have home-field
advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kind of used to that now,'' Angels manager Terry Collins
said. ``When we play the Dodgers or Padres, the crowds are pretty
noisy. And you'll see it again when the Yankees come in, and the
Red Sox. We've got to establish a base, we've got to establish
excitement. But we've got bigger problems than the crowd right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Velarde had four hits for the Angels, but he was countered by
Padres first baseman Wally Joyner, who also had four hits. Brian
Boehringer (6-2) started for the Padres and got the victory after
allowing one run and four hits in five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Hoffman, the last of three Padres relievers, pitched the
ninth for his 23rd save.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Salmon, in his second game back with the Angels after
missing 62 with a sprained wrist, went 0 for 2 with three walks as
the DH. Tonight he'll be back in right field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a matter of getting back to where I'm supposed to
be,'' Salmon said. ``That's where I'm supposed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   He's 0 for 7 with three walks and an RBI since returning, but
says he feels he's making progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hits haven't been there, but I'm having good at-bats,'' he
said. ``With the walks today, I had a good game plan, fouled off
some pitches and didn't swing at bad ones. Those are good steps for
me.''

VALENTIN'S DAY TURNS FOR BETTER 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-VALENTIN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN VELLANTE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The day started miserably for Red Sox third baseman
John Valentin.
</P>
<P>
   In the first inning, he made an error that led to a pair of
unearned Florida runs. Then, in his first at-bat, he rapped into a
4-6-3 double play.
</P>
<P>
   In the third inning, with the Sox trailing, 5-2, Valentin, who
had doubled into the left-field corner, didn't score when Brian
Daubach followed with a double to right-center.
</P>
<P>
   But then he righted himself and wound up playing a pivotal role
in the come-from-behind 11-9 win.
</P>
<P>
   --In the fourth, he doubled to left, driving in Jose Offerman,
to cut the Marlins' lead to 9-6.
</P>
<P>
   --In the sixth, he drilled a long sacrifice fly to center,
scoring Trot Nixon and pulling the Sox within 9-8.
</P>
<P>
   --And in the eighth, he tripled to dead center, driving in Nixon
and Offerman and putting the Sox ahead for the first time since the
second inning, 10-9.
</P>
<P>
   His line on the afternoon read 3 for 4, two doubles and a
triple, four runs batted in, two runs scored, and seven total
bases.
</P>
<P>
   It was his best all-around offensive effort since coming off the
15-day disabled list July 11 after being hit in the head June 25 by
a pitch from the White Sox' John Snyder. He missed 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   The four RBIs left him one shy of 500 for his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had some key at bats, he hit the ball hard all day long,''
said manager Jimy Williams. ``He certainly had some big RBIs for
us, especially the last one.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentin talked about his up-and-down effort moments after Tim
Wakefield put down the Marlins in the ninth to secure the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day didn't start off too well,'' he said. ``I boot a ball
and the run scores and then I hit into a double play. But we
battled back and scored some runs.''
</P>
<P>
   On his eighth-inning triple, his first of the season, Valentin
said, ``(Vladimir Nunez) threw me a first-pitch slider trying to
get me to hit into a double play, but didn't get it over the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then he had to throw me a strike and I was able to hit the
ball hard. The wind might have played a factor, I don't know. It's
just nice that we were able to pull it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentin hopes Sunday's win, in which the Sox fought back from
2-0, 5-3, and 9-5 deficits, will help the club shake the doldrums
of the past two weeks, during which time it dropped seven of 11
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really hope so,'' said Valentin. ``We go out there and play
hard every day. We haven't been playing all that well lately, but
today was a good sign. We battled back and hopefully this will get
us untracked.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentin, who has been beaned three times in his career, says he
feels pretty good about his return.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough when you've been hit in the head three times,''
said Valentin. ``It's tough to get back in there and try to focus
on just the ball. You can't worry about getting hit again, though,
because stuff like that happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit some balls hard yesterday and only got one hit, but
today I felt really good up there. Hopefully I'll get hot and
continue to get some hits for the team. It's been an up-and-down
season so far, but maybe a win like this will help turn things
around.''

CROWDS ANSWER `EYES WIDE SHUT'S COME-HITHER CALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sexual drama ``Eyes Wide Shut'' enticed American
moviegoers at the nation's multiplexes with a solid $22.8 million
at 2,411 theaters during the Friday-Sunday period as the
much-anticipated film dominated a robust weekend, studio sources
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The victory for ``Eyes Wide Shut'' underscored this summer's
continued strong pace at the box office, with every top 10 film
taking in at least $5 million. Overall, receipts totaled an
impressive $129 million _ up 7 percent from the same weekend 1998
as 17 films topped $1.5 million _ including an astounding $1.56
million at only 27 theaters for the opening of horror film ``The
Blair Witch Project.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an excellent weekend with something for everybody,''
said Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source forecasting
service. ``There's a lot of diversity for customers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' made by the legendary director Stanley
Kubrick and starring the husband-wife team of Tom Cruise and Nicole
Kidman, opened amid generally strong reviews following months of
intensive publicity. Kubrick's death in early March heightened
public interest and the Warner Bros.' promotional campaign stirred
buzz partly by showing the stars in various stages of undress.
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum, who projects a final domestic gross of $120 million,
said the film performed best in major cities where its R rating was
less likely to hold down viewership. Warner Bros. distribution
chief Dan Fellman said the film drew slightly more women than men
and performed better than expected among patrons in the 18-25 age
range.
</P>
<P>
   Fellman also said the tragedy surrounding the disappearance of
John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane over the weekend may have held down
moviegoing among the core audience of adults. ``We think the movie
will clearly be a good performer for a long while,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The opening also reflects Cruise's drawing power as ``Eyes''
became his sixth consecutive film to debut at No. 1. The five
previous _ ``Jerry Maguire,'' ``Mission: Impossible,'' ``Interview
With the Vampire,'' ``The Firm'' and ``A Few Good Men'' _ all
topped $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing a strong second was Universal's second weekend of
``American Pie'' with $13.3 million at 2,518 theaters as the comedy
declined 30 percent from its opening. ``Pie,'' made for $11 million
and carrying surprisingly strong critical support, should be hugely
profitable with $45.3 million in its first 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's third weekend of ``Big Daddy'' continued to post solid
grosses with $10.5million at 3,254 theaters, pulling its total past
$134 million. 20th Century Fox's opening of ``Lake Placid,''
starring a giant alligator gone amok, followed with a respectable
$10.4 million at 2,095 sites. Bucksbaum credited the studio's
decision to focus on the reptile in the promotional campaign had
rescued a film that could have easily disappeared quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Warner's third weekend of ``Wild Wild West'' came in fifth with
$10 million at 3,342 sites as the action-comedy continued to
generate decent business but well short of the blockbuster level
many had anticipated, with a 19-day total at $94million.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount's coming-of-age comedy ``The Wood,'' set in Inglewood
and focusing on a trio of African-American male friends, performed
respectably in sixth with $8.6 million at 1,191 theaters, topping
Disney's fifth weekend of ``Tarzan'' with $7.4 million at 2,838
theaters. ``Tarzan'' has grossed nearly $143 million and is 73rd
highest on the all-time list, ahead of ``Saturday Night Fever.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's ninth weekend of ``Star Wars: Episode 1 _ The Phantom
Menace'' came in eighth with $5.3 million at 1,854 theaters, 593
fewer locations than last week as theaters fulfilled their
commitments for eight-week runs and the space saga hit $394.8
million. ``Phantom Menace'' will probably pass ``E.T. The
Extra-terrestrial'' at $399.8 million for the No. 3 domestic spot
next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount's fifth weekend of ``The General's Daughter'' followed
in ninth with $5.2 million at 2,258 theaters, edging Sony's opening
of ``Muppets From Space'' with a modest $5.1 million at 2,265 sites
as the sixth Muppet movie appears likely to be lost in the shuffle
when Disney opens ``Inspector Gadget'' next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   A trio of entries were battling for 11th, each with $4.3 million
_ Sony's second weekend of ``Arlington Road,'' New Line's sixth
weekend of ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' and
Paramount's third weekend of ``South Park: Bigger, Longer and
Uncut.'' The ``Austin Powers'' sequel has topped $190million,
placing it 30th on the all-time list, ahead of ``Snow White and the
Seven Dwarfs.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite being in only 27 theaters, Artisan Entertainment's ``The
Blair Witch Project'' finished 17th, trailing ``Notting Hill,''
``An Ideal Husband'' and ``Summer of Sam.'' ``Blair Witch,'' made
for $50,000 in eight days of shooting in the Maryland wilderness,
generated an impressive per-theater gross of $57,694.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my 18 years in the business, I've never seen a film
generate this kind of interest with sellouts at every location,''
said Artisan President Amir Malin. ``We think that the
reality-basis of the film _ that it seems like real life _ is
what's making people empathize and connect with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Artisan will expand the run of ``Blair Witch,'' which has
received strong critical support, to about 700 theaters on July 30
and may add additional sites in the next two weekends. ``We think
that having to turn people away and making it a real hard ticket
adds to the anticipation,'' Malin said.
</P>
<P>
   The performances by ``Blair Witch'' and ``Lake Placid'' may
portend a solid opening next weekend for DreamWorks'
horror-thriller ``The Haunting.'' Also opening will be ``Inspector
Gadget'' and New Line's cheerleader comedy ``Drop Dead Gorgeous.''

EDMONDS TO SLOW UP ON RECUPERATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Anaheim Angels sent a message to center
fielder Jim Edmonds Sunday: Slow down.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds has been so eager to return to the field that he has
pushed his surgically repaired right shoulder too far, and the club
has decided to ease off on his rehab work.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds was informed of the plan in a meeting with manager Terry
Collins, general manager Bill Bavasi, hitting coach Rod Carew,
trainer Ned Berger and team medical director Dr. Lewis Yocum on
Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The gist of the meeting was that such a surgery requires four
months of recovery time. Given that the surgery was April 22, don't
expect Edmonds back until mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim is making progress and we're happy with his progress,''
Yocum said. ``But we're going to slow him down with his swinging.
Our date of four months hasn't really changed. It's predicated on
the biology of the surgery. It takes that time for the tissue to
heal. Rushing that can damage the labrum or result in further
damage.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, there will be no batting practice, only hitting soft
toss with Carew.
</P>
<P>
   ``He progressed well from hitting off a tee to soft toss,''
Yocum said. ``Then he started hitting off Terry, and Terry throws
heat. Jim got sore, a little too sore. It's not safe to take live
BP until he builds more strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Yocum said his biggest concern is Edmonds' ``enthusiasm to get
back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But just the sight of Edmonds taking batting practice had
people in the organization _ not just Edmonds _ a little too
giddy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got excited, I got excited and it was like, `Wait a
second.' There's not pain in the problem area. It's just sore in
the muscles around it, which is good.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds, who had previously expected to be back Aug. 1, admitted
he'll have to temper his excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard. He's one of the best players in the American
League,'' manager Terry Collins said of holding back Edmonds. ``But
I'll be damned if we bring him back early and end up losing him for
another two or three weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Hill on the mound: Pitcher Ken Hill will be activated from
the disabled list today and start tonight's game against the
Padres.
</P>
<P>
   Hill hasn't pitched since June 30 because of an inflamed right
elbow. He had surgery on the elbow in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
   __ On deck: The Angels and Padres play the second game of their
three-game series tonight at 7:05. RHP Hill (3-8, 5.58 ERA) will
start for Anaheim against San Diego's RHP Matt Clement (5-8, 4.78).

VAN DE VELDE FALLS APART 
</HEADLINE>
 OPEN-VAN DE VELDE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARNOUSTIE, Scotland _ Jean Van de Velde turned his l'Arc de
Triomphe into the Tour de France Sunday, and as a result, the
wheels fell off his bid to bring the British Open crown home to
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   As he approached the 18th tee at Carnoustie Golf Club, the 72d
hole of the tournament, the claret jug that goes to the British
champion was all but his. He was on the verge of becoming the
second Frenchman to taste the French wine of victory in the
tournament's 128 years, joining Arnaud Massy and ending a 92-year
drought for his country.
</P>
<P>
   On a day that wasn't so much a test of survival as of
self-destruction, the second- and third-round leader, had done the
least damage to himself. True, he had dissipated the five-shot
advantage with which he started the afternoon, falling a stroke
behind playing partner Craig Parry at the 11th when he bogeyed and
Parry parred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started a bit shaky,'' Van de Velde said.
</P>
<P>
   But he'd gotten the edge back on the very next hole _ with a
bogey, which qualified as quality golf on this day _ as Parry
triple-bogeyed. Justin Leonard caught him briefly, but Van de Velde
nudged ahead with a birdie at the 14th, and now he was home free.
He stepped to the par-4, 487-yard 18th with a three-shot cushion on
Leonard and Scottish favorite Paul Lawrie, whose tournament-best 67
seemed destined to give him no better than second place.
</P>
<P>
   All Van de Velde had to do was stay out of trouble. Which was
too much to ask.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, that is not a simple request, for the 18th is a fitting
climax to this sadistic layout. A canal slashes across it _ the
nefarious Barrie burn _ weaving from right to left until it fronts
the green like a border patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a piddling double bogey was all Van de Velde needed, and
he knew as much after knocking his tee shot some 280 yards down the
right _ just missing the burn _ when his caddie, Christophe
Angioliu, inspected the leaderboard and informed him.
</P>
<P>
   The ball was in the rough, and prudence dictated that Van de
Velde lay up in front of the burn guarding the green. But he found
his position irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I came over, the ball was like fantastic,'' he said. ``I
could not have placed it any better. The only thing I had was 185
or 189 to carry the water, which wasn't very demanding.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was beyond him on this occasion. His 2-iron second shot
caromed off the grandstand on the right and bounced back into the
rough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pushed it a little,'' Van de Velde said. ``I would have been
better in the water, actually, because I would have had to drop it
somewhere, hit on maybe a good lie, or if I had a good angle, then
two-putted, still make 6, and get away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, this was no problem. All Van de Velde needed to do was
chip onto the fairway, loft the ball onto the green, and have two
putts to play with. The second victory of his obscure career _ and
first since the 1993 Roma Masters _ was still guaranteed. His name
was about to be etched into the precious jug. His wife, Brigitte,
and two young daughters were being hoisted over the small brick
wall between the 18th and the Carnoustie Hotel veranda so they
could share his glory. A fable right out of Disney _ so appropriate
for a golfer sponsored by EuroDisneyland _ was about to have a
saccharine ending. An illogical one, too, for this nondescript
33-year-old veteran had been forced to survive a qualifying
tournament last week just to get into this elite field. Now the
plot line boiled down to this: Play it safe and he would conquer
the world's best.
</P>
<P>
   He never considered it. Neither did his caddie. Whether it was
Gallic gallantry or gall, Van de Velde went for the green. And
found the cursed burn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a dramatic lie,'' he said. ``I couldn't go backwards.
The only thing that I could try was to go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   And down. For some 15 minutes, while the crowd waited in
anticipation, Van de Velde debated what do next. He rolled up his
pants, took off his shoes and socks, and descended into the burn
like a kid playing in a creek.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I looked at the ball from short of the green,
three-quarters of the ball was outside the water,'' he said. ``I
started to come down and I could see the ball sinking, telling me,
`Hey, you silly man. Not for you, not today.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So he opted to take a drop and a one-stroke penalty. The ball
rolled back within the boundaries of the hazard, so he took a
second drop. Now the situation was dicey, but still not impossible.
He needed to chip onto the green and sink his putt to salvage a 6
and the championship.
</P>
<P>
   He shanked his shot into the greenside bunker that is another of
the niceties on this farewell hole.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden, the whole thing _ the tournament, the jug, the
immortality _ was in pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Van de Velde did salvage something by getting up and down in two
from the trap, punching the air in defiance when he sank an 8-foot
putt. But the unlucky 7, for a round of 77 and 290 total, was on
the board, and the benumbed Van de Velde was left to engage the
equally stunned Leonard and Lawrie in a four-hole playoff.
</P>
<P>
   The unraveling continued as he butchered his drive on the first
extra hole, the 15th, declaring an unplayable lie and taking yet
another one-shot penalty. He never recovered and wound up losing by
two strokes as the Scots rejoiced over native son Lawrie's gift
triumph.
</P>
<P>
   But Van de Velde handled perhaps the most bizarre collapse in
golf history as he had handled his sudden prominence of the
previous two days _ with grace and insouciance.
</P>
<P>
   He answered questions with a breezy, good-humored smile. And
while he acknowledged that he was devastated, he said, ``You know,
I read the newspaper like you all did this morning, and some
terrible things are happening to other people. And as I say, it is
a golf tournament, it's a game, and I gave it my best shot.''
</P>
<P>
   But he did make one promise. ``You (can) say I'm a coward,
whatever,'' said Jean Van de Velde, the British Open champion who
suddenly wasn't. ``Next time I hit a wedge.''

RECORDS FALL TO HEYNS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAMONA SHELBURNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Penny Heyns is in a zone.
</P>
<P>
   Both Heyns and her South African Olympic teammate Ryk Neethling
were a perfect four for four at the Janet Evans Invitational at
USC. But Heyns' streak was a bit different than Neethling's. Heyns
might have  &UR; !ital! &LR; only won two individual titles, but she set a
new world record all four times she dived into the pool,
preliminary or finals, including new standards for the 100-meter
breaststroke on Sunday and 200-meter breaststroke on Saturday.
Neethling captured event titles in the 200-, 400-, 800- and
1500-meter freestyle races.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very weird and I'm all blown away and everything,'' Heyns
said. ``If I thought of it as world-record swims, I'd really be too
overwhelmed.''
</P>
<P>
   Heyns tried to break her own world record in the 50-meter
breaststroke in a special time trial but missed it by .38 of a
second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little disappointed but no excuses,'' said Heyns, who
swam alone in lane 4 with a packed crowd and poolside cheering her
on. ``I think if it was a race situation it would have been
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Kristine Quance-Julian placed fourth in the 200-meter
breaststroke Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   __ Inspirational: Lenny Krayzelburg owns the American record in
the 200-meter backstroke and is the second fastest man ever in that
event. The next milestone would be a world record.
</P>
<P>
   After competing at the Janet Evans Invitational, Krayzelburg has
a good idea of how to set a world mark after Heyns made quick work
of two of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been so close (to the world record) and to see her, it
just makes me so excited,'' said the former USC All-American and
two-time world champion in the 100- and 200-meter backstroke.
</P>
<P>
   Krayzelburg, originally from the Ukraine and now living in
Studio City, came the closest to breaking a record in the 200-meter
race, when he broke the Janet Evans Invitational meet record with a
1:57.68. But he fell short of his American record (1:56.95) and the
world record of 1:56.57. He also set a meet record in the 100
meters with a 54.63.

SLOPPY US ESCAPES CUBANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN _ The United States won again Sunday at the pre-Olympic
Qualifying Tournament of the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   But its opponent made the biggest news and got the biggest
cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Already overmatched, Cuba became decidedly more so before its
88-52 loss to the Yanks when four of its players, including three
of the top four scorers, apparently defected. Cuban basketball
officials said they had no knowledge of the whereabouts of the
four, two of whom are signed to play professionally in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the defections had little to do with the mighty US
and everything to do with the schedule and the disappointing play
of the Cubans. Cuba was 0-3 entering Sunday night's game and had no
hope of advancing to the second round, which starts Monay. The team
was scheduled to return home after the game. This was a real
getaway day.
</P>
<P>
   The four Cubans were center Lazaro Borrel, 26, who averaged 25
points a game last season for Obras Sanitarias in Buenos Aires;
Angel Caballero, 28, who has signed to play for Obras next season;
playmaker Roberto Herrera, 24, and Hector Pina, a 23-year-old
center who did not play in any of the three previous games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You gotta think about life, what's important,'' said Gary
Payton. ``They had an opportunity, and they took it. They want to
get out of their country. You can't fault them for that. I was
thinking about how their families are going to be treated. The way
I hear it, one of their fathers (Herrera) is big-time in the
Olympics. He's going to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Herrera is the son of Ruperto Herrera, president of the
Cuban Basketball Federation. Ruperto Herrera Jr., a center,
defected last May to Argentina. Cuba also has had swimmers defect
in Puerto Rico and has lost basketball players via defections in
1993 and at the World Championships in Toronto in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Tomas Herrera, head of the Cuban delegation and no relation to
the defector, said, ``We have very little information. They were
not at the hotel when the bus came to get them. We do not know why
they are absent. No one has seen them.''
</P>
<P>
   Borrel clearly is the gem of this bunch. A lithe, active 6 feet
7 inches, he was averaging 21.3 points and 10.3 rebounds a game. He
had 28 points and 16 rebounds in Cuba's opening game, an overtime
loss to Uruguay. He was playing in Argentina under an arrangement
with the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw a lot of him on film. He's OK,'' Payton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough game for us after we heard Cuba was going to be
shorthanded,'' US coach Larry Brown said. ``Our players admired the
way they played.''
</P>
<P>
   So did the crowd. Cuba played an inspirational first half and
trailed by only 15, 47-32, at the break. Center Angel Nunez had 14
points, and the crowd twice broke into chants of ``Cuba, Cuba,''
after hustling plays by the Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's good for them,'' Payton said. ``We know it's going to
be that way when we play Puerto Rico, too. Everyone wants to beat
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the Cubans managed only 20 points in the second half as
they wore down in the face of the United States' vast superiority.
Still, the 88 points represented only the seventh time that an
international team with NBA players has been held to less than 100
points. It is the second-lowest total for such a team; only the 87
that the 1996 Olympians scored in a 33-point victory over Angola
was lower.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Allan Houston led the US in scoring with 17 as six players were
in double figures. Jason Kidd had 10 assists and five steals . . .
Richard Hamilton's USA Basketball experience continues to be a
total bummer. The ex-UConn star has yet to play in the tournament
due to a sprained ankle. Sunday, he didn't even make it to the
arena because of what US officials said was a stomach bug . . .
Second-round play starts Monday with the United States playing the
Dominican Republic.

MAZZOLENI, HARVARD A PERFECT FIT

<P>
   BOSTON _ Harvard hockey fans can expect to see up-tempo games
under new coach Mark Mazzoleni, who will be introduced to the media
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in playing at a high tempo,'' said Mazzoleni from
his Essex, Ohio, home Sunday, where his phone was ringing off the
hook with friends congratulating him on his new post.
</P>
<P>
   ``A coach who was a major influence on me was Doug Woog when I
was his assistant at Minnesota,'' said Mazzoleni, who coached at
Miami of Ohio the past five years. ``He believed in fast-paced
games, and I saw how successful he was and followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand Harvard has some excellent skaters and we'll be
able to play that up-tempo game.''
</P>
<P>
   Mazzoleni, who coached Miami to an 85-83-20 overall mark,
previously led Wisconsin-Stevens Point to three straight NCAA
Division 3 national championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark's background at outstanding schools, his long track
record of success, and his enthusiasm for the sport and the way
it's meant to be played were key factors in his selection,''
Harvard athletic director Bill Cleary said in announcing the
appointment Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzoleni, 43, becomes the fourth head coach of Harvard hockey
since 1950 and replaces Ronn Tomassoni, who stepped down in May
after nine seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzoleni and Harvard seem to be a perfect fit. He was a
four-year starter in the nets at Michigan State and was an
outstanding student _ he was named his team's outstanding
student-athlete as a senior. He's an academics-first, sports-second
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be in Boston real soon with my wife Karen,'' said
Mazzoleni. ``I'm really excited about the new job and the
challenge. I'm very honored.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the rink and met a lot of people on my visit to Boston
and I liked everything. The Harvard family is a great family and
I'll like being a part of it. I'm very comfortable with Bill
Cleary.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great opportunity and I want to get to work real
soon. I'm anxious to meet the players.''

billion articles of clothing and gave the Salvation Army alone
several hundred million pieces, well over 100,000 tons. The glut is

SWEET BACK PEDALING THROUGH TOUR 
</HEADLINE>
 DE FRANCE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAINT GAUDENS, France _ Once again, the first-place rider stayed
in first place Sunday. And the last-place rider stayed in last.
</P>
<P>
   American Lance Armstrong held onto the Tour de France's yellow
jersey for best overall time, even though Russian Dimitri Konyshev
won the 124-mile 14th stage in 4 hours 37 minutes 59 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the spectrum, Australian Jay Sweet rolled in
more than 15 minutes later. He now has a firm grasp on last place
in the overall standings _ 2:35:53 behind Armstrong after two weeks
and almost 1,700 miles of competition.
</P>
<P>
   In each stage, riders have to finish within a specified time
that varies according to the difficulty of the course. Sweet, 23,
has made it just under the wire every stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done plenty of races, but none like this, and it's pretty
hard getting up every day and doing it again,'' he said. ``I've
struggled a lot in the past week, sometimes coming in by myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The French have a name for the last-place finisher _ lanterne
rouge _ which has the opposite glamour of the yellow jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet said he often feels like getting off his bike and getting
in the ``broom wagon'' that sweeps the course to pick up
stragglers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard, because when you're on your own like that, your
whole body's aching and you're tired, and no matter what you try
and think, your mind does nothing but send negative thoughts,'' he
said. ``The whole time you're thinking, why do this to yourself?
What are you doing? You're only going to do it again tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then there's another small part of my mind, I guess in my
heart, that's saying, `Ah, keep going, keep going.' '' So he does.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet said he is hurting from a bruised heel he suffered in an
accident last week, although he wouldn't blame all his woes on the
injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the problem . . . the problem's just the Tour and
how many kilometers we've done,'' he said. ``It's a long ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweet, surrounded by cameras and tape recorders before Sunday's
race, admitted there's a certain distinction to his plight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, one thing that keeps me going is that people are still
interested,'' he said. ``In the crowd, a lot of people are showing
me respect and encouraging me to keep going, even though I'm
last.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the the wearer of the leader's jersey, Sweet acknowledged
that he doesn't see very much of Armstrong on the course.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, not really,'' he said with a laugh. ``Sometimes I can look
way ahead through the bunch and see this little speck of yellow.''
</P>
<P>
   A speck that is invisible by the end of the race.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong has been hotly pursued by reporters, and not just for
his racing accomplishments. After the race, he talked about the
drug accusations that have been made about him. ``Some journalists
are unprofessional,'' he said. ``It's too bad that when you're in
the yellow jersey, people say you're on drugs. I have nothing to
hide.'' . . . Phil Anderson, who used to ride with Armstrong on the
Motorola team, is at the race leading a group of tourists from his
native Australia. About the leader, Anderson said: ``I knew Lance
had potential for a one-day race; he was one of the great riders
coming out of America. But no one ever saw that he had strength
like this. What it took to get where he is, it's magnificent. When
he was staring death down the barrel (with testicular cancer),
maybe he saw he had more strength than before, he just never tapped
into it.'' . . . The race is down to 152 competitors. The Postal
Service team lost another rider when Dane Peter Meinert-Nelsen, who
suffered from a sore left knee the whole Tour, dropped out. He had
surgery on the knee last fall. Teammate Jonathan Vaughters quit two
weeks ago after he suffered a mild concussion in a crash during the
second stage . . . Armstrong was scheduled to tape a segment for
the ``Today'' show this morning, but it may get bumped either
because of the show's time constraints (the news of John F. Kennedy
Jr.) or his (a training ride on the Tour's day off). Armstrong said
on today's ride he plans to go to the spot where teammate Fabio
Casartelli crashed and eventually died in 1995.

IT'S RALLY TIME FOR RAFTER 
</HEADLINE>
 CUP-RAFTER-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE _ Patrick Rafter seemed primed to take his place in
sports infamy alongside the 1980 Soviet Olympic hockey team, the
1969 Baltimore Orioles, and the 1984-85 Georgetown men's basketball
team. Early in Sunday's Davis Cup match against Todd Martin, the
lanky Australian began to take the form of a walking trivia
question: Who was the victim in one of the greatest upsets in
professional tennis history?
</P>
<P>
   You had to feel for Rafter. Twenty minutes before the match, he
didn't know who he was playing. Thirty minutes into the match, it
looked as if he didn't come to play.
</P>
<P>
   He pitied Martin, who was suffering from the heat before the
match and at times looked as if he would collapse. But after losing
the first two sets, the pity ended.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter stepped up to capture the next two sets in convincing
fashion. After trailing, 3-0, in the fifth and final set, he
rallied to put the all-but-spent Martin away for a 4-6, 5-7, 6-3,
6-2, 6-4 triumph that sent Australia into the centennial Davis Cup
semifinals against Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably one of the most joyous occasions I have ever
had,'' said Rafter. ``I think it will sink in the next few days.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory capped an eventful week of tennis for Rafter. He was
slated to play Martin when the pairings were announced Thursday,
but US captain Tom Gullikson said Saturday there was a possibility
he would replace Martin with Pete Sampras, who joined the Davis Cup
team late and said he would only play doubles.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the Australians said they weren't anticipating
Sampras to play because Martin was not ill, and a replacement
cannot be allowed unless a player is given medical clearance to be
excused from a match.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, as Martin complained of heat exhaustion following a
workout, Sampras took to the court to practice. That resulted in
more confusion for Rafter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Todd probably was not feeling 100 percent,'' said
Rafter. ``I saw him on the court and he didn't look great.'' Asked
if he thought Martin was faking the heat exhaustion, Rafter said,
``No, I mean, Todd, you're not going to get a better sportsman in
the world than Todd, and I have a lot of respect for Todd.''
</P>
<P>
   But early in the match, Martin played as if all the talk about
heat exhaustion were false, and Rafter played as if he were the one
who needed to be excused.
</P>
<P>
   He looked stiff, tentative, out of sync.
</P>
<P>
   Martin took the first four games of the first set but struggled
and saw Rafter cut it to 5-4. Martin regrouped and launched four
serves Rafter couldn't handle: the first three were clocked at 116,
102, and 104 miles per hour, respectively. The fourth was a
117-m.p.h. ace that would have made Jeff Gordon proud. It gave
Martin the game and the set, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter went ahead, 3-2, then 5-4 in the second set, and it
appeared momentum was shifting. But Martin, buoyed by a partisan
crowd, held Rafter to just three points over the next two games to
forge ahead, 6-5, then fired a 123-m.p.h. ace in the next game to
take the set, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most difficult things to do is to play someone you
know is injured,'' said Rafter, ``but once they get a ball into
their zone, they are relaxed because they know they have to go for
it. I didn't know what to expect from the beginning. I tried to get
a few first serves in, and boom, there were winners all over the
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Australian captain John Newcombe, who implied Martin wasn't as
ill as believed, said the uncertainty took a toll on Rafter early.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very hard one for Pat to play,'' he said. ``You could
see Pat thinking, `Oh, gee, I am playing someone I can beat, but he
is just going for his shots, and it would be a terrible loss if I
lose.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rafter regrouped and fought off several amazing shots by
Martin to win the third set. He looked his sharpest in the fourth
set, breaking a 2-2 tie by taking the last four games.
</P>
<P>
   Fate seemed to turn against him again in the fifth, when Rafter
fell behind, 3-0. He pulled to 4-2, held Martin to one point in the
next game to pull to 4-3, then came up with four exceptional serves
to hold Martin pointless and tie the set.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter went ahead, 5-4, after Martin defaulted at 30-30 and then
captured the game on a cross-court backhand winner. The last game
was what many expected the match to be _ a mere formality. Rafter
served strongly, collected three quick points, and got Martin to
return long on the fourth for the match.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than suffering one of the most regrettable losses in
Davis Cup history, Rafter became the person who ended the
Americans' bid to win the Cup in its 100th year.

RULING BECAME MATTER OF OPINION

 CUP-DOCTOR-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Members of Longwood approached Dr. G. Richard
Paul immediately following the Americans' elimination from Davis
Cup play. The man wearing a red baseball cap, white tournament
shirt, khaki pants, and a beeper has belonged to the club for 22
years. As he strolled the grounds by the grass courts,
acquaintances took the opportunity to jokingly question his medical
judgment. ``Have you ever seen a sick man?'' asked one tennis fan.
Others complimented the call that ultimately doomed American
chances to advance.
</P>
<P>
   Neutral doctors at the Davis Cup take no specific Hippocratic
oath for tournament duties. But they are expected to offer medical
opinions based on fact, not favoritism.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, less than an hour before the first reverse singles
match, Paul ruled that American Todd Martin appeared fit enough to
compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be ethical about it,'' said Paul. ``I think it was
one (decision) where integrity had to be maintained. You wouldn't
want to win an event with an asterisk on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The neutral doctor's opinion contradicted the assessment of US
team doctor David Altchek, who observed signs of heat exhaustion
following a brief, prematch practice. The decision of Paul quickly
became the center of postmatch controversy as the home team
discussed its loss.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who required intravenous fluid before the contest,
grinded and grimaced through five sets against Patrick Rafter. With
US Davis Cup hopes resting on his shoulders, Martin lost to Rafter,
4-6, 5-7, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4. But the neutral doctor felt the
3-hour-13-minute match gave ample support for his ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Paul, a practitioner of sports medicine and orthopedic surgery,
observed no visible signs of heat exhaustion when he met with
Martin approximately an hour before the match. The exam took place
in the US team's clubhouse facilities and consisted of questions
concerning how Martin felt. The player talked about experiencing
cramps for the first time during Friday's singles match. Altchek
claimed Martin suffered disorientation after his late morning
warmup.
</P>
<P>
   From 10:30 a.m. to 11, Martin and Courier hit on the competition
court. Each time there was a pause in play Gullikson and team
support personnel placed damp towels around Martin's neck. He
walked off the court under his own power, feeling as he did after
facing Lleyton Hewitt on Friday. According to Altchek, the
29-year-old sounded incoherent. Upon entering the US locker room,
Martin had trouble finding his bearings. He sat down before a
mirror and was concerned with the unhealthy way he looked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was starting to get a little panicked because I knew Pete
wasn't here yet and we only had about a half an hour until Tom had
to put in the lineup for the day,'' said Martin. ``I found Gully
and I told him that I wasn't feeling so hot. Found the medical
staff and they suggested a few things and after that I said I just
don't know if I'm fit to play; each and every one of them agreed
with me because each and every one of them were on the court with
me earlier when I was hitting with Jim. It wasn't too impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   After the US medical staff and captain deemed Martin unfit to
play, two calls went out. Captain Gullikson telephoned Pete Sampras
and told him to get prepared to play singles. Stefan Fransson,
International Tennis Federation head referee for the tie, also was
contacted about the situation. Reached in his office under the
south-side stands, he walked to the clubhouse and brought Paul with
him.
</P>
<P>
   Paul questioned Martin and saw no typical signs of heat
exhaustion, which can include profuse sweating, nausea, dizzyness,
and a warm skin temperature. Heat stroke is more severe, occurring
when a person stops sweating and his core temperature rises
dangerously high. Paul and Altchek noted that the examination by
the neutral doctor took place after Martin had taken a shower and
attempted to rehydrate. The team doctor admitted that when Paul
evaluated Martin, the American player was significantly more
coherent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had watched them _ the two American singles players _
warming up at 11 a.m,'' said Paul, who is affiliated with BU
Medical Center, Winthrop Community Health Center, and New England
Baptist Hospital. ``They both looked fit and very crisp. Then, I
departed and went back in the clubhouse. Somewhere about 12 o'clock
I was called by Stefan to meet with the US team or with Dr.
Altchek. They described the condition of Todd as being one of heat
exhaustion or one of potential heat exhaustion. But when I saw him
and examined him and interviewed him, he was certainly fully in
command of every capacity. So, there was no hard evidence that he
couldn't play.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if his decision was easy based upon what he saw, Paul
answered firmly, ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Altchek interpreted the exam results much differently. He saw
Paul nodding his head as he talked to Martin. He assumed the
neutral doctor was in agreement with the earlier assesment of the
US medical staff and would rule the player unfit to compete.
Altchek made a breif phone call and upon his return was shocked to
hear Martin had to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not talking about life or death heat illness,'' said
Altchek. ``We are talking about heat exhaustion that makes you
unfit to compete at your normal level. That is what we are dealing
with with Todd. So there were no physical examination finding like
elevated core temperature, abnormal electrolytes, or anything like
that, or urine specific gravity changes. There was simply a sense
of the player that he couldn't compete and a visual observation
that after 15 minutes of practice, he lost his bearings and had to
be helped off the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a level of subjectivity here. But I think the key
issie then is I didn't feel that in the condition he was in he
could compete. So what did we do? We IV hydrated him before the
match. That is not standard procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the infusion of intravenous fluid broke from normal
practices, Fransson was fully prepared to let the decision of the
neutral doctor stand whether he ruled the American player fit or
not. Acknowledging that he is not a doctor, Fransson said that he
relied on Paul's opinion when it came to assessing the medical
status of Martin.

IT'S RALLY TIME FOR RAFTER 
</HEADLINE>
 CUP-RAFTER-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Patrick Rafter seemed primed to take his
place in sports infamy alongside the 1980 Soviet Olympic hockey
team, the 1969 Baltimore Orioles, and the 1984-85 Georgetown men's
basketball team. Early in Sunday's Davis Cup match against Todd
Martin, the lanky Australian began to take the form of a walking
trivia question: Who was the victim in one of the greatest upsets
in professional tennis history?
</P>
<P>
   You had to feel for Rafter. Twenty minutes before the match, he
didn't know who he was playing. Thirty minutes into the match, it
looked as if he didn't come to play.
</P>
<P>
   He pitied Martin, who was suffering from the heat before the
match and at times looked as if he would collapse. But after losing
the first two sets, the pity ended.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter stepped up to capture the next two sets in convincing
fashion. After trailing, 3-0, in the fifth and final set, he
rallied to put the all-but-spent Martin away for a 4-6, 5-7, 6-3,
6-2, 6-4 triumph that sent Australia into the centennial Davis Cup
semifinals against Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably one of the most joyous occasions I have ever
had,'' said Rafter. ``I think it will sink in the next few days.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory capped an eventful week of tennis for Rafter. He was
slated to play Martin when the pairings were announced Thursday,
but US captain Tom Gullikson said Saturday there was a possibility
he would replace Martin with Pete Sampras, who joined the Davis Cup
team late and said he would only play doubles.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the Australians said they weren't anticipating
Sampras to play because Martin was not ill, and a replacement
cannot be allowed unless a player is given medical clearance to be
excused from a match.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, as Martin complained of heat exhaustion following a
workout, Sampras took to the court to practice. That resulted in
more confusion for Rafter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Todd probably was not feeling 100 percent,'' said
Rafter. ``I saw him on the court and he didn't look great.'' Asked
if he thought Martin was faking the heat exhaustion, Rafter said,
``No, I mean, Todd, you're not going to get a better sportsman in
the world than Todd, and I have a lot of respect for Todd.''
</P>
<P>
   But early in the match, Martin played as if all the talk about
heat exhaustion were false, and Rafter played as if he were the one
who needed to be excused.
</P>
<P>
   He looked stiff, tentative, out of sync.
</P>
<P>
   Martin took the first four games of the first set but struggled
and saw Rafter cut it to 5-4. Martin regrouped and launched four
serves Rafter couldn't handle: the first three were clocked at 116,
102, and 104 miles per hour, respectively. The fourth was a
117-m.p.h. ace that would have made Jeff Gordon proud. It gave
Martin the game and the set, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter went ahead, 3-2, then 5-4 in the second set, and it
appeared momentum was shifting. But Martin, buoyed by a partisan
crowd, held Rafter to just three points over the next two games to
forge ahead, 6-5, then fired a 123-m.p.h. ace in the next game to
take the set, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most difficult things to do is to play someone you
know is injured,'' said Rafter, ``but once they get a ball into
their zone, they are relaxed because they know they have to go for
it. I didn't know what to expect from the beginning. I tried to get
a few first serves in, and boom, there were winners all over the
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Australian captain John Newcombe, who implied Martin wasn't as
ill as believed, said the uncertainty took a toll on Rafter early.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very hard one for Pat to play,'' he said. ``You could
see Pat thinking, `Oh, gee, I am playing someone I can beat, but he
is just going for his shots, and it would be a terrible loss if I
lose.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rafter regrouped and fought off several amazing shots by
Martin to win the third set. He looked his sharpest in the fourth
set, breaking a 2-2 tie by taking the last four games.
</P>
<P>
   Fate seemed to turn against him again in the fifth, when Rafter
fell behind, 3-0. He pulled to 4-2, held Martin to one point in the
next game to pull to 4-3, then came up with four exceptional serves
to hold Martin pointless and tie the set.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter went ahead, 5-4, after Martin defaulted at 30-30 and then
captured the game on a cross-court backhand winner. The last game
was what many expected the match to be _ a mere formality. Rafter
served strongly, collected three quick points, and got Martin to
return long on the fourth for the match.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than suffering one of the most regrettable losses in
Davis Cup history, Rafter became the person who ended the
Americans' bid to win the Cup in its 100th year.

STROKES OF PLUCK, NOT LUCK 
</HEADLINE>
 CUP-ANALYSIS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ When it was done and Todd Martin had smashed
his racket on the Longwood asphalt in frustration, his captain kept
patting him on the back and telling him it was OK, that he'd played
heroically. When it was done Sunday afternoon and the Aussies were
ripping off their shirts in celebration, Pete Sampras came off the
bench and embraced him, telling Martin that he was proud of him for
competing so hard. All true, and yet . . .
</P>
<P>
   He shouldn't have been out there. Even if he had pronounced
himself fit to play, even if he hadn't needed a doctor's order and
an IV bag to get him on the court, Martin shouldn't have had to
carry the US Davis Cup team on his back. Sampras should have.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody outside of his own locker room really believed that
Martin would take the court for the decisive singles match against
Australian ace Patrick Rafter. Not with the Yanks down, 1-2, after
the doubles. Not with the Wimbledon champ fit and rested and ready
(if not willing) to save the day.
</P>
<P>
   The Aussies were saying that back in April, when they were
sitting in Zimbabwe watching Jim Courier knock off the Brits on the
road. ``We looked at each other and said, we'll see Sampras in
Boston,'' captain John Newcombe said.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Sampras insisted he would only play doubles here, the
Aussies wouldn't believe it. If anything, they figured that Courier
also would step aside to let Andre Agassi, the French victor and
Wimbledon finalist with a 26-5 Cup record, step in.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that the way it happens everywhere else? Isn't that the
way the Aussies did it in 1973, when contract pros were ruled
eligible for Cup play and Newcombe and Rod Laver suddenly became
available?
</P>
<P>
   No matter that John Alexander and Phil Dent and Snake Case and
Geoff Masters had carried the flag during the lean years. Australia
had been without the Cup since 1968. Newk and Rocket were the best
in the world, no arguments. They stepped in, flew to Cleveland,
destroyed the bloody Yanks, 5-0, and took the punchbowl back Down
Under.
</P>
<P>
   The Aussies never believed that the US, which had won the Cup
once since 1992 and was playing at home in the centennial year,
would leave its best player on the bench, especially after Martin
had been bopped by 18-year-old rookie Lleyton Hewitt on Friday.
They assumed that Martin would develop a Sunday-morning case of
bursitis or a stiff neck or a migraine or meet up with a bad bowl
of chowdah.
</P>
<P>
   Or that he would get dehydrated and dizzy after Sunday morning's
knockabout with Courier and claim he couldn't go. Which is exactly
what Martin did. He told Tom Gullikson he ``wasn't feeling so
hot.'' He told the team medical staff he didn't think he was fit to
play. He waited outside the Australian locker room, wanting to give
Newcombe his word that he really was feeling lousy, that it was a
legit pullout.
</P>
<P>
   And when a neutral doctor concluded there was nothing wrong with
Martin that a little fluid and some cold towels couldn't fix, he
walked out onto the 130-degree hot-top to face the world's No. 1
(as of next week) player _ and damned near beat him.
</P>
<P>
   Martin had lost five of his last six matches to Rafter and three
of four on outdoor hardcourts. He had lost to him at Wimbledon. And
yet, he led Rafter two sets to none Sunday. He was up, 3-0, in the
fifth, up 4-2 and serving _ and then the wheels came off. ``I
played two very good sets and three OK sets,'' Martin would say.
``And lost.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of the 3 hours 14 minutes he was out there, Martin
looked like a dead man walking. Even in the first 20 minutes, when
he was up, 4-0, and two breaks on Rafter, Martin wasn't sure he
could continue. ``Can you go on?'' Gullikson asked him during the
changeover. ``Are you OK?''
</P>
<P>
   Martin wasn't OK. Not physically, not mentally, not emotionally.
He shouldn't have been out there. He didn't want to be out there.
And yet he was out there, in the middle of a Hemingway short story
_ Winner Take Nothing. Even if Martin knocked off Rafter, it would
only have bought his mates one more match. ``Even if I won,'' he
mused, ``we weren't out in the clear.''
</P>
<P>
   All Martin could do was lose, and save Gullikson the trouble of
rounding up four guys for a weekend in Moscow. And yet he soldiered
on with the sweat stinging his eyes and the shirt plastered to his
skin, hoping to play quick points that would produce quick games
before his tank ran dry. ``Do as little as possible for as good a
result as possible,'' Martin figured.
</P>
<P>
   Up two sets and 40-15 on Rafter's opening serve in the third,
Martin looked poised to steal the day. But Rafter held on and it
came down to the fifth. For a delicious moment, with Martin serving
for 5-2 and the crowd chanting U-S-A, U-S-A and the Harvard Band
playing ``Yankee Doodle Dandy'' for him, it was there. Then Martin
double-faulted and Rafter ran out the match and the tie and the
year.
</P>
<P>
   He sat for a long time in his courtside chair, his face buried
in a towel. Then Martin did his sporting duties, shaking hands with
the Aussie bench. ``Great fight, mate,'' Newcombe told him. ``Well
done.''
</P>
<P>
   And then the man who shouldn't have been there waved to his
cheering countrymen in the scorching bleachers and walked off.
``Are you proud?'' he was asked later. ``All my life I've been
taught that pride is a sin, so I'm not necessarily proud,'' Todd
Martin replied. ``I am pleased that I had the courage to go out and
play and play well.''

COACH WAS BOUND TO DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
 CUP-GULLIKSON-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ He appreciated that Pete Sampras spoke up and
said he would not have been here if it were not for Tom Gullikson.
</P>
<P>
   He admired the way Todd Martin _ after being told that he must
play when the team doctor thought he should not _ gutted it out and
nearly won his singles match against Patrick Rafter.
</P>
<P>
   And he looks forward to next year's Davis Cup, when the rules
will allow captains more flexibility in who they play and how they
substitute players.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday night, Gulllikson allowed himself a little Monday
morning quarterbacking.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a similar situation again, Gullikson said, he would
still add the world's best player to his team. But not with strings
attached.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in retrospect I have had a little time to reflect on
it after the match, and certainly if you are on the team you are on
the team, absolutely,'' he said. ``That's what I would do in
hindsight.''
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Sampras signed on late. After Todd Martin and
Jim Courier led the US over Great Britain, Sampras called Gullikson
and said he would like to help out. But in deference to Martin and
Courier, Sampras only wanted to play singles.
</P>
<P>
   A deal, said Gullikson, was a deal. If he had pushed Sampras
earlier, the player likely would have opted not to play at all.
</P>
<P>
   This deal put him in a bind.
</P>
<P>
   His hands were tied first by Sampras and then by Davis Cup rules
that wouldn't allow him to substitute Sampras when he said he would
play singles on the final day.
</P>
<P>
   All of which made for a long, draining week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I've probably felt more fresh,'' Gullikson said. ``It
has been a challenging week, no question about it. Maybe it is a
character builder, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   What he does know is that he's glad Sampras appears to be back.
There may have been short term pain and frustration, but having
Sampras around can only lead to long-term gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have him on the team can certainly add to the team but
obviously made for a lot of speculation this week in your eyes and
a lot of other peoples' eyes,'' Gullikson said. ``But any time you
can put Sampras on a tennis court, preferably in singles, but even
in doubles, it is a plus. I think it is not only important for the
American Davis Cup team but obviously tennis worldwide. To have the
best player on the planet playing Davis Cup is great for Davis
Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Australia moves on to face Russia in a Davis Cup semifinal,
while the US is left to worry about next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows? It's not my call,'' Gullikson said when asked his
status as coach.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are he'll be back for another try, and next time he'll
have more freedom when it comes to substitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst rule ever has been rescinded,'' Gullikson said.
``Coaches in every sport can play whomever they want. Shaquille
O'Neal and Kobe Bryant don't play every minute of every game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be great to have the captain be able to make the
calls,'' he said. ``It'll actually give the captain a little more
creativity, and in some ways it will put a little more pressure on
the captain to have to make the matchup instead of having the
matchups already done. But it will make things a lot more
interesting, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that things can get much more interesting than they were at
Longwood this past weekend.

 PICTURES OF A DESK AND A SALUTE  &HT;     By STEVE RUBENSTEIN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was the picture, shown over and over, of the salute.
</P>
<P>
   And there was the picture, shown over and over, of the child
hiding under his old man's desk.
</P>
<P>
   The Bay Area and the world sought Sunday, amid their grief, to
conjure up a fuller picture of the young man. To remember John F.
Kennedy Jr. primarily as a 3-year-old boy is inadequate, almost
vaguely insulting.
</P>
<P>
   At St. Mary's Cathedral on Gough Street in San Francisco, the
priest did his best. He worked some words about Kennedy into his 9
a.m. sermon about Jesus and the mustard seed. It was well done, yet
it was a stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does it not make you stop and recognize the vulnerability of
our lives?'' the Rev. Agnel De Heredia said. ``To lose someone like
John John, whom we have seen when he was 2, playing under his
father's desk ... and saluting his father's coffin.''
</P>
<P>
   The desk and the salute, again.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the two pictures say more than all the words spilling forth
over the past hours: a playful attempt, amid all the trappings of
power, to be himself, and a reflexive, almost instinctive, response
to grief.
</P>
<P>
   The priest called him John John, a name Kennedy heard a lot but
didn't like very much. When he came to San Francisco in 1997 for
the opening of the Saks Fifth Avenue's men's store, someone called
him John John, in a nice way.
</P>
<P>
   ``One John will do,'' he replied, in a nice way, with the air of
a man who had said it before and would, because it was his
birthright, be obliged to say again.
</P>
<P>
   At the opening, he arrived late, minus his cufflinks. Inside the
store, he found another pair of cufflinks. All these facts were
noted, because the lateness of Kennedys and cufflinks of Kennedys
are taken note of.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, born into a family of the famous and great, was famous.
He appeared where famous people appear, at openings, on magazine
covers, on the arms of the also famous.
</P>
<P>
   He wore the mantle with grace, humor, humility, good looks. He
did not ask for the part. He dated well, dressed well, married
well. The people who knew him for who he was said he was didn't
have a big head about who he was.
</P>
<P>
   He was big news, even when doing nothing. When he appeared at
the 1988 Democratic Convention, he got a standing ovation before
speaking a word. One San Francisco writer said the crowd ``would
have given him a standing ovation for blowing his nose on the
floor.''
</P>
<P>
   It was no insult. It was just good reporting.
</P>
<P>
   When he flunked his bar exam the first time, it was big news.
When he flunked his bar exam the second time, it was big news.
</P>
<P>
   When he passed, on his third attempt, it was news, too. Not
everything comes easily, even to those for whom it's supposed to.
</P>
<P>
   If he were being groomed, or grooming himself, for the family
business of politics, he was, at the age of 38, taking his time
about it.
</P>
<P>
   People his age shared their generation with him, little else.
People in journalism shared their calling with him, little else.
</P>
<P>
   After all, he entered the trade with the rank of publisher,
hardly an entry-level position.
</P>
<P>
   These past hours, the grief seems real, yet rehearsed. The
grievers, perhaps with the same instinct that John John displayed
with his salute, know reflexively by now what to do when a member
of that haunted family is taken.
</P>
<P>
   And from the other picture, the one of him hiding under the
desk, it is clear that he was born to a life with photographers in
it and that he had a gift for knowing what to do when their cameras
were pointed his way.

 THE END OF THE LINE  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Another Kennedy apparently has been killed, really the last
Kennedy, and on one of the TV shows, the talk turned to John
Kennedy Jr.'s magazine, George.
</P>
<P>
   ``The material is thin,'' said the guest expert.
</P>
<P>
   There's a stunner. George is about politics and political
figures. Measured by his or her moral fiber and character content,
the current American politician would make Calista Flockhart look
porky.
</P>
<P>
   I may have missed them, but I haven't heard any Gettysburg
Addresses recently. The most famous political speech of the last
decade was the ``That woman'' speech. If George is thin, it's
because you don't make a hearty stew from hors d' oeuvres
toothpicks.
</P>
<P>
   Now that we've had a couple days to praise and mourn the man,
maybe the gentle backlash begins. John Kennedy Jr. was a pleasant
fellow, well-meaning and sincere and scary handsome, but harmless.
Political-impact-wise, Kennedy-wise, he was more of a hood ornament
than a vital moving part.
</P>
<P>
   The mourning, by this reasoning, is requiem for a lightweight.
</P>
<P>
   John-John wanted to be an actor, for God's sake. Sure, that's
how great politicians like Reagan and Ventura got started, but it's
hardly a dignified route for a Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   John Jr. was almost 40, and all he'd done nationally was publish
a magazine that featured covers with hot babes in powdered wigs.
</P>
<P>
   What have we lost, the backlashers will ask, other than a rich
young man with a famous family name, with no real goals, playing
with toys _ magazines and airplanes?
</P>
<P>
   And, by now, hasn't the whole Kennedy mystique been de-mystiqued
by all the years of booze and floozies?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you had to be there. I remember the day in high school
when it was a coin flip whether I'd live to see lunch. The Russians
had missiles in Cuba, and President Kennedy told the Russians to
get out, or else. They didn't seem scared.
</P>
<P>
   I kept waiting for a blast or a flash of light from a few miles
to the west, since the Russians were sure to bomb Los Angeles. I
didn't know if we were close enough to be instantly vaporized or
would go the slower radiation-death route.
</P>
<P>
   You don't get through a day like that without gaining some
appreciation for the courage and leadership of JFK.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the civil rights stuff. Spencer Haywood, a former
basketball star, told me of his experience the day Kennedy died.
Haywood was a teenager in a small Mississippi town, a black kid
working at an all-white country club where the members sometimes
used Haywood and the other black caddies as driving-range targets.
</P>
<P>
   When news of Kennedy's assassination arrived, the club members
erupted in a crazy, frenzied celebration, whooping and hollering
deep into the night, guzzling booze and firing guns into the air,
the wildest party Haywood has ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   That was the Kennedy impact on America.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people were expecting, hoping _ and some fearing _ that
John Jr. would eventually pick up that old Kennedy ball and run
with it. And maybe that was wishful thinking, because he claimed to
have no desire to enter the nasty warfare of politics.
</P>
<P>
   But John-John was always a time bomb, an object that struck fear
and /or hope in many hearts: a Kennedy determined to make a
difference.
</P>
<P>
   You know, he didn't start George to get rich. And the magazine
never became a must-read, but the concept was intriguing, maybe
brilliant, certainly unique: to interest people in politics, at a
time when the wide gap between the two parties isn't nearly as
large as the Grand Canyon between politicians and the people they
govern. Fewer and fewer people vote, fewer and fewer feel remotely
connected to the electing and governing process.
</P>
<P>
   What if a magazine could help reverse that trend of alienation,
the feeling that we're being governed by Martians? What if a
magazine could talk politics without beating the reader over the
head with a partisan hammer? Without making you even more angry and
cynical about the whole deal?
</P>
<P>
   A TV commentator, Tucker Carlson, said that some people saw
George as Kennedy's stepping-stone to public service. ``But this
 &UR; was  &LR; public service. He was doing a service for his country.''
</P>
<P>
   Who knows what would have come next? John Jr. said he never
mapped out his future, just kind of let it find him. The magazine
was faltering; maybe the next phase would have been running for the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   President John-John?
</P>
<P>
   Was John Jr. too much a lightweight? If so, somebody had better
get the hook for Danny and Al and Hillary and Liddy and the
feathery cast of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   But now John-John is probably dead, and Camelot has folded the
tents and gone out of business. When JFK was killed, there was
still Bobby. When Bobby was killed there was still Ted, and then
there were the Kennedy clones, like Clinton, and there were the
Kennedy kids.
</P>
<P>
   Now there are pieces of airplane washing up on a beach.

BRAVE NEW NANO-WORLD LIES AHEAD
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Computers the size of dust particles. Medical devices no bigger
than bacteria. Hand-carried weapons of mass destruction. On-off
switches invisible to the naked eye.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most outlandish fantasies are starting to seem
almost plausible _ and some are coming true _ as scientists advance
into what was once the exclusive domain of sci-fi dreamers.
</P>
<P>
   Nanotechnology, as the field is known, refers to manipulating
and building materials on an atomic or molecular level. The
emerging art gives scientists the tools to build objects precise to
the last nanometer, or one-billionth of a meter _ the scale of
atoms and viruses.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most significant developments so far, computer
designers at Hewlett-Packard last week unveiled a working on-off
switch _ the basic element of integrated logic circuits _
consisting of a single layer of molecules suspended between wires.
The researchers hope to use the switches and other diminutive
components in microscopic ``nanocomputers,'' machines billions of
times more powerful than today's personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   The goal behind nanotech is to give humans the power to create
things much the way nature does: from the bottom up, atom by atom,
molecule by molecule.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneers in physics, chemistry, medicine and computing envision
a 21st century landscape of the super-small, in which the tiniest
particles all fit into place according to human design.
</P>
<P>
   ``The grandest dream of nanotechnology,'' said Richard Smalley,
a winner of the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1996, ``is to be able
to build with the atom as the building block.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates point out that so-called molecular manufacturing is
already happening all around us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nature does that when it builds complicated molecules precise
to the last atom,'' said Smalley, director of the Nanoscale Science
and Technology Center at Rice University in Texas. ``The dream is
to get to the point where we can do that ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The dream is clearly starting to catch hold.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has identified nanotech as one of the priority
new technologies for the 21st century, and a proposal before
Congress would essentially double the federal government's annual
spending on the field, which this year totals about $232 million.
</P>
<P>
   Where the research might lead is anyone's guess, but it seems
that nearly anything is theoretically possible if atoms and
molecules can be individually controlled.
</P>
<P>
   It's an odd world that may take some getting used to. Future
applications of the technology seem limited only by the
imaginations of nanotech aficionados:
</P>
<P>
   Picture ``programmable paint'' that changes color on command. Or
temperature-sensitive cloth and voice-activated shrink-wrap bags.
Airplane wings made of smart metal skin could change texture to
match changes in air conditions. Or how about ``floorless
elevators,'' in which invisible swarms of super-tiny computerized
``hands'' reach out and grab you as you step into the elevator
shaft.
</P>
<P>
   Because little has been done beyond the level of basic research,
everybody is free to toy with a favorite fantasy application.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Von Ehr, chief executive of a nanotech startup in Texas
called Zyvex, likes to talk about ``smart nail polish,'' loaded
with sensors, actuators and computing power, programmed to paint
itself out in stripes or even form animated scenes on your
fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   As incredible as it sounds, there is nothing in the laws of
physics to prevent such a thing from happening, according to Ralph
Merkle, a leading nano-guru and theoretical physicist at Xerox PARC
in Palo Alto. ``It's clearly feasible,'' Merkle said.
</P>
<P>
   Nano-visions were championed most famously by physicist Eric
Drexler in his 1986 book, ``Engines of Creation.'' But nanotech
actually traces its roots to a famous 1959 talk, titled ``There's
Plenty of Room at the Bottom,'' given at the California Institute
of Technology by the late physics genius Richard Feynman.
</P>
<P>
   Feynman outlined just how all the text printed in all the books
in the world could be packed onto the heads of a handful of pins.
Today, there is little argument as to the essential truth of
Feynman's vision _ the only real dispute is which particular
pathway might lead to it.
</P>
<P>
   Drexler conjures up possibilities for a ``universal assembler,''
the core manufacturing technology for his version of the nanoworld.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a tiny robot, equipped with arms small enough to grab
atoms one by one, whose first assignment would be to construct a
copy of itself. Given a little time, and some cheap raw materials
that would donate the atomic bricks and mortar, whole factories
could quickly spring up _ at least in the minds of some
nano-thinkers.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts, even those who are helping to pioneer the new
technology, doubt the first assembler will ever be built.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a fundamental problem with that dream,'' Nobel
laureate Smalley said. ``I don't believe it's possible to get the
fingers on those arms small enough to do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite this so-called fat fingers problem, beguiling computer
simulations of little atom-sized gears and other machinery are all
over the Internet nowadays. Even more astounding, however, is the
fact that researchers in real-world laboratories are actually
beginning to clear some of the early hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at IBM made worldwide headlines by demonstrating how
they could spell out the company name, one atom at a time. A
graduate student at Cornell University even built a nanoscale model
of a six-string guitar, each string just 100 atoms wide. Twenty of
these guitars, laid out end to end, would roughly equal the
diameter of a single strand of hair.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, scientists have found ways to turn strands of DNA
into structural scaffolding; locate a single atom of one type
hidden among billions of different atoms on a surface; and make
images of whirring rotary engines, far too small to be visible
except by sophisticated measurements of atomic forces.
</P>
<P>
   Burrowing even deeper, optics specialist Carlos Stroud at the
University of Rochester has shown it may even be possible to sculpt
the cloud of electrons that buzz around the nucleus of atoms, using
lasers like spatulas on so much subatomic putty.
</P>
<P>
   Stroud wouldn't even speculate why one might want to do that.
``This is basic science,'' he said. ``The applications will come
later.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, researchers say nanotechnology, once considered
a field of crackpots _ with physicist Drexler viewed as something
of a cult figure _ is gaining mainstream respectability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Science clearly has accepted the notion,'' said Al Globus, a
computer scientist and nanotech experimenter at NASA's Ames
Research Center in Mountain View. ``It's not exactly what Eric
(Drexler) had in mind, but it's pretty darn close. This is real
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hewlett-Packard single-molecule computer component is
designed to function on a new generation of chips made through a
series of chemical reactions, rather than printed circuitry. An
entire chip produced this way would fit within the intersection of
two of the tiniest wires now used in computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, the goal is not just to make computers the size of
dust particles,'' said Hewlett-Packard computer architect Philip
Kuekes, who noted that dust particles in fact are ``rather large''
by nano-standards. ``The idea would be to make simple computers the
size of bacteria. Then you could get something as powerful as
what's now on your desktop into a dust particle.''
</P>
<P>
   Smalley, chairman of the chemistry faculty at Rice University,
won his Nobel Prize in 1996 for co-discovery of the special form of
carbon called buckminsterfullerene, affectionately named for the
famed architect and known as ``buckyballs'' for their
characteristic soccer-ball structure.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Smalley's Rice University nanotech center offers elongated
buckyballs, or nanotubes, for sale over the Internet.
(http://cnst.rice.edu/ tubes/) The wire-shaped molecules of carbon
are one of the more promising design elements of the new field.
</P>
<P>
   You can order 250 milligrams of single-walled nanotubes, each
one about one-billionth or so of a meter across, swimming in a
special solution like tiny noodles in broth, for just $350.
</P>
<P>
   The stuff looks like a vial of dirt. The tubes are too small to
see, even with the most powerful microscope. But Smalley guarantees
they are in there, somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   He and others also can prove that the unique structure of the
nanotubes gives them astonishing characteristics. They are 200
times stronger than steel, for example, and also can function as
metallic conductors of electricity or as semiconductors, depending
on how they are made.
</P>
<P>
   They are already being used as the incredibly fine tips at the
business end of the most powerful imaging devices yet invented,
atomic force microscopes or their cousins, the so-called scanning
tunneling microscopes.
</P>
<P>
   Nanotubes and other carbon-based designs could also create the
working circuitry of a new generation of super-powerful computers,
machines that would make today's desktops and handhelds seem
absurdly big and slow.
</P>
<P>
   At Stanford, scientists are trying to arrange rows of nanotubes
in special arrays. By pushing many of the tubes around at the same
time, it might be possible to begin building something big enough
to be useful.
</P>
<P>
   There's little point in making things too small to be seen or
even detected, researchers point out. And if engineers have to make
each machine one molecule at a time, it would take weeks just to
make a single working element in a supercomputer that would need
billions of elements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making one is easy,'' said Tom Soh, an electrical engineer and
research associate at Stanford. ``Making many of them, and making
sure they work, is very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   But once the process of creating and controlling the nanotubes
is perfected, experts hope to weave strands of super-strong
nanotube ropes. Such techniques make possible lightweight materials
with potentially novel properties. It opens the possibility of car
bodies weighing just a few hundred pounds, or perhaps superlight
space probes made of nanotech skin.
</P>
<P>
   As if that weren't enough, NASA's Globus speculates about a
``mature nanotechnology'' someday enabling the construction of
``active materials'' with computing power embedded within, like
specks of lint.
</P>
<P>
   Nanotube actuators might be built in to convert electrical
energy to mechanical energy in extraordinarily subtle ways. The
result would be materials that could sense defects and repair them
automatically at the atomic scale _ so that things would never have
to wear out.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine an elevator cable extended into space, suspended in
orbit, constructed of braided nanotube ropes thousands of
kilometers long. If it ever broke, half of it would fly up, the
other half would plummet to Earth. So sensors and actuators could
be built into it to keep that from happening.
</P>
<P>
   It's a well-worn fantasy that once graced the cover of a popular
science magazine. But is such a thing possible?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are probably a lot of reasons why it can't be done, but
I can't really think of any,'' Smalley said.
</P>
<P>
   Merkle, at Xerox PARC, is among the leading visionaries of such
things as ``reversible logic,'' a scheme to make computers much
smaller and more efficient than is possible now.
</P>
<P>
   He sees a new world of nanotech medicine, in which tiny
instruments can repair damage with unimaginable precision. That
would allow for repair of freezing damage in cryonics experiments,
another of Merkle's pet ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this stuff is feasible,'' he said. ``It's going to be done
at some point. The bickering now is really just about how long it
will take.''
</P>
<P>
   Also in Palo Alto, the Foresight Institute _ founded by
physicist Drexler _ organizes prestigious nanotech conferences that
draw an increasingly illustrious scientific crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``We define the technology rather ambitiously, in terms of the
goals,'' said Chris Peterson, executive director of the institute
and Drexler's spouse. ``Give it another five to 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The entry of venture capitalists and big names of academia and
government belie the fact that much of what passes for nanotech now
are speculative musings, ideas that sound like trappings from
late-night movie plots.
</P>
<P>
   And like any new science, there's always a dark side.
</P>
<P>
   Technology that churns out miniature computers could also be
used to create miniature weapons. And because the science could
allow just about anyone to make just about anything _ jeopardizing
the world's current understanding of the word ``ownership'' _ it's
not much of a stretch to imagine nanotech social and economic
chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Oblivious to such dire possibilities, Marc Arnold, chief
executive of a St. Louis-based telecommunications company called
Angel Technologies, co-founded a $250,000 ``Feynman Grand Prize''
for whoever is first to produce a mechanical device that fits
certain design specifications and is small enough to fit in a box
100 nanometers on all sides.
</P>
<P>
   Just how such a device might be used is beside the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's only the starting point,'' Arnold said. ``We need to
make good social and political decisions, but that's true about any
new technology. Molecular nanotechnology is inevitable, whether
it's here in three years or 30 years.''

 &HT;    U.S. insists Martin genuinely ill
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ U.S. Davis Cup captain Tom Gullikson planted
the seed of suspicion Saturday after the doubles match, calling
Todd Martin ``a medical marvel'' with ``an assortment of
problems.'' He said he would consider putting Pete Sampras into
Sunday's singles lineup to play Patrick Rafter.
</P>
<P>
   Davis Cup rules stipulate that substitutions into singles can be
made only if a player becomes ill or injured, so it didn't surprise
anyone that Martin came down with a last-minute ailment.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who was found practicing an hour after Gullikson's
comments Saturday, responded that he was fit to play and hadn't
heard any speculation until a reporter alerted him to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed, I was upset,'' Martin said. ``I didn't
feel like I was in bad enough shape not to play and told Gully...
that I was healthy and ready to go. Unfortunately, it didn't take
me very long this morning to feel like I was (ill).''
</P>
<P>
   The decision was made to stay the course, but the next morning,
Martin complained he was ill after hitting for 30 minutes with Jim
Courier. At 11 a.m., he sought out U.S. team physician, Dr. David
Altchek, who advised Martin not to play and prescribed a bag of
intravenous fluids.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt exactly the way I felt when I walked off the court
against Lleyton (Hewitt on Friday),'' Martin said. ``When I walked
in the locker room, I didn't have my bearings and sat down for
about five minutes and unfortunately was looking in a mirror and
saw how I looked. I didn't like the way I felt.''
</P>
<P>
   Gullikson then called Sampras, still at his hotel, at 11:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had been trying to cheat, he would have already hit and
had eight rackets strung and been ready to play,'' Gullikson said.
``Pete thought I was joking around. I said, `No, I am dead serious,
you need to get over here.'''
</P>
<P>
   Martin was examined shortly after noon by the International
Tennis Federation physician, Dr. Richard Paul, who ruled Martin
must play.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's performance, a five-set match that Rafter won,
exonerated the physician.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played three and a half hours of pretty good tennis in the
heat and had Pat two sets to love and two breaks in the fifth,''
Australian captain John Newcombe said. ``I think that speaks for
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Loose points
</P>
<P>
   The Australians broke the U.S. team's 13-match winning streak
when Jim Courier has played a match and a 20-match winning streak
when the United States has won the doubles point.... More than 50
former U.S. Davis Cup team members were recognized before Sunday's
matches, and Atlanta residents Tom Gorman and Mike Green were among
them. Gorman is the winningest U.S. captain in history, serving
from 1986 to '93, and playing in 1972-73 and '75. Green was a
member of the 1956 and '57 teams. Richey RenebergThe only Atlanta
native ever to play for the U.S. team is the late Bitsy Grant

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: `Weather tourists' not welcome
 &HT;    (For release July 21, 1999.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ It was a short piece as articles go in the July 11 New
York Times Sunday Magazine, but it caught my eye _ and irritated
it.
</P>
<P>
   The story was about a new type of creature, one who seeks out
tornadoes and hurricanes supposedly for the thrill of it. ``Weather
tourists,'' the article called them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to use the word sexual, but there's something
about the process of a hurricane that really appeals to me,'' one
interviewee from the state of Washington was quoted. He said he was
heading to the Outer Banks of North Carolina for the hurricane
season.
</P>
<P>
   It is questionable as to whether these ``weather tourists''
really are chasing storms for the thrill of it. I strongly suspect
that their goal is peddling footage of the storm knocking down
trees, beaching boats, causing fires and leaving people homeless.
</P>
<P>
   The Times article cited an Oklahoma company that charges $2,000
for a two week tornado-chasing tour; 35 people came aboard this
past season. The operators of the tour said they made additional
money selling storm footage to cable networks.
</P>
<P>
   As a victim of the 1992 monster called Hurricane Andrew, I was
offended by the drift of this article; it read almost as if a
hurricane was a thrill ride at the county fair.
</P>
<P>
   What those weather-thrill shows (tornadoes, floods, hurricanes,
earthquakes) don't do is stick with the story. Once the wind stops
blowing or the ground shaking, the thrill seekers pack their bags
and head out, leaving those who were battered to their own misery _
a torment that can last, in the case of Hurricane Andrew, for
years.
</P>
<P>
   About a week after Andrew pulverized so much south of Miami _
including my home and the homes of a son and a daughter _ a busload
of tourists came up my residential street. I was in the process of
adding yet another load of destroyed household goods onto the
mound-like pile of hurricane debris in my front yard.
</P>
<P>
   Offended by this intrusion into my misery, I greeted the busload
with a single finger.
</P>
<P>
   Several days later, when the 82nd Airborne cruised my street in
a Humvee, it was an altogether different reaction. We greeted them
with tears; they had come to help, to stop looters, to provide
water and, hopefully, to keep tourist buses out of the area.
</P>
<P>
   The chronicle of a hurricane just begins with the storm actually
striking. Certainly there are tales to tell about the hit; of
divine intervention, of heroic moments, of destructive forces.
</P>
<P>
   But the misery of a hurricane (or tornado) has a life far beyond
its active cycle, and this is what offends me about ``weather
tourists.'' If they really want to see what a hurricane is capable
of doing, spend more time on the scene after the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   Stand by daily as victims cope with sleeping at more fortunate
relatives' homes, of living without electricity, telephone or water
for weeks afterward. There's no thrill in it, not a thrill surge
like the power of the storm itself.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Andrew brought months-long misery to the people in my
area. Most of the retrospective conversation is about the
aftermath, not the storm itself. T-shirts were being worn that
said: ``I Survived Andrew, But Not The Aftermath.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``weather tourists'' were nowhere to be seen when we found
ourselves locked in battle with contractors and subcontractors,
with roofing companies, with insurance companies, with zoning
inspectors, with workers who didn't show up to complete the job of
reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   They also were not there to film the sardonic joy, 10 months
later, of having a sink through which water poured.
</P>
<P>
   Given my preference, I would suggest this to the ``weather
tourists'': Stay home, and since you enjoy them so much, we'll see
if we can get one of those alluring hurricanes up to you.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Watch the chopping up of America on white-guy TV
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The NAACP is making big noise about the blanching of network TV
entertainment, and not without reason. None of the 26 new shows
this fall will feature, much less star, a black character. It is
more than a little creepy to find yourself aced out in your own
country. Broadcast TV passes as the village common these days.
</P>
<P>
   But there's more to this tale than a fit of racial
absentmindedness on the part of (white) programmers.
</P>
<P>
   Say, first, that the NAACP is right to pound the lectern. It is
perfectly bizarre that the major networks seem to have forgotten
not only what country they are in but also the increasingly diverse
country they will be in after we survive Y2K. The American
population is steadily becoming more kaleidoscopic.
</P>
<P>
   The nets are hemorrhaging viewers to cable competitors and are
hustling for ratings, but how much of a future can there be for a
mass medium _ if remaining so is the networks' intention _ as
white-guy TV?
</P>
<P>
   That said, there's more at play here than the familiar racial
negligence. New technical capacities and old market economics are
combining to produce mixed outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial radio has been subdividing its audiences for years.
It is a distinctly odd station that offers varied programming.
There are, instead, country music stations, rock stations, urban
stations and so on. The money trick is not to assemble a mass
audience but to dominate one of the categorical audiences.
</P>
<P>
   So with TV, cable systems offer channels counted by the score
with ever more tightly targeted demographics _ business news
channels, channels for female viewers, Hispanic channels, Christian
channels. Cable systems typically offer two or more channels
dedicated to black programming.
</P>
<P>
   Counting cable, holdover shows on the major networks and
black-cast shows on smaller networks (WB, UPN), it is likely that
even with the default this fall, there still may be a greater black
presence on television than ever.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, the break away from mainstream TV seems to suit
most black viewers. The lists of most-watched shows by white and
black viewers rarely have more than one or two in common, usually
major sports events. The presence of a continuing black character
or two seems to give only a marginal ratings boost.
</P>
<P>
   That separation is serviced not only by advertisers and
programmers making common cause. It is abetted by an attitude in
the black community _ shared, though in very different terms, by
the street and the intelligentsia _ that mainstream America is to
be disdained and shunned as unblack. And never mind that its
African American and Afro-Caribbean admixtures are a major part,
maybe the largest part, of what makes broad American culture
distinctive.
</P>
<P>
   Part of what the NAACP is seeing is an energetic commercial
tribalizing of American life, as economic interests dice us into
small bits, pleasing formerly neglected social constituencies in
order to sell to them but doing so by chipping bits of the
population away from the whole.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; RAYMOND CHANDLER: A BIOGRAPHY &LR;  By Tom Hiney. Grove, $14. A
British journalist traces the muddled life of Philip Marlowe's
creator from his grim Chicago roots through his hard-drinking Los
Angeles years, and shows how he elevated detective fiction to an
accomplished literary enterprise. In 1997 the reviewer R.W.B. Lewis
called this a ``thoughtful and finely rounded biography.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PARK CITY: NEW AND SELECTED STORIES &LR;  By Ann Beattie. Vintage
Contemporaries, $14. This collection of three dozen stories written
over a 25-year period is full of small but sharp tales of quiet
domestic rupture featuring parents and children brought face to
face with their own insignificance by infidelity and broken
marriages. But the characters seem to find a way to manage, thanks
mostly to the balms of friendship and humor. ``Hers is a palette of
compassionately wielded pastels, and her stories are watercolors of
the highest order, ``Lorrie Moore wrote in The New York Times Book
Review last year. ``One feels amazed at the confidence, steadiness
and quality of the output.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MENDEL'S DWARF &LR;  By Simon Mawer. Penguin, $12.95. This ambitious
novel about a brilliant genetic scientist _ and dwarf _ whose
great-great-great-uncle was the pioneering geneticist Gregor Mendel
explores the moral, historical and philosophical implications of
their research. The result is ``an odd and affecting literary
experiment,'' Francine Prose wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE FIRE WITHIN THE EYE: A HISTORICAL ESSAY ON THE NATURE AND
MEANING OF LIGHT &LR;  By David Park. Princeton University, $16.95. A
physics professor sweeps through an amazing array of material, from
atomic theory in ancient Greece to the invention of the laser, to
answer a still-perplexing question: What is light? Is it a thing or
a quality? In 1997, Dick Teresi called this ``a graceful book.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE WILD PARTY: THE LOST CLASSIC &LR;  By Joseph Moncure March.
Illustrated by Art Spiegelman. Pantheon, $12. This ribald
ballad-novel, originally published in 1928 and reissued in 1995
with demonic illustrations by Art Spiegelman, uses rhymed couplets
to conjure a night of Jazz Age debauchery orchestrated by a saucy
pair of lovers named Queenie and Burrs. ``It's quite addictive,''
Margo Jefferson wrote in The New York Times. ``We forget ... how
potent cheap verse can be.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GAIN &LR;  By Richard Powers. Picador USA, $14. Two stories _ one
tracing the rise of a family soap-and-candle business into a
conglomerate, the other about an Illinois woman who blames the
company's chemicals for her ovarian cancer _ draw a link between
the growth of corporations and the decline of humane values. Last
year the reviewer Bruce Bawer called this novel ``erudite,
penetrating and splendidly written.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE PROCESS: 1,100 DAYS THAT CHANGED THE MIDDLE EAST &LR;  By Uri
Savir. Vintage, $15. The chief Israeli negotiator during the three
years leading up to the Oslo peace accords chronicles both the
arduous political jousting and the mutual respect that developed
among participants on both sides. The result is ``an insider's
story of how bitter contenders for the same tiny patch of parched
land struggled to disentangle their mutual hatreds, grievances and
claims,'' Serge Schmemann wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has reissued  &UR; THE DREAM PALACE OF THE ARABS:
A GENERATION'S ODYSSEY &LR; , by Fouad Ajami ($14), in which a noted
scholar maintains that Arab writers and intellectuals have neither
accommodated to reality nor created the world they desperately
need. ``He gives a vivid and often moving account of Arab thought
today,'' Ira M. Lapidus wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MAN OR MANGO? A LAMENT &LR;  By Lucy Ellmann. Picador USA, $12. A
grumpy hermit living with her cello and her cats in an English
village finds her solitude threatened by her equally sour
ex-boyfriend. Last year the reviewer Lisa Zeidner called this novel
``a rambling, sometimes very funny rant about love and
loneliness.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WE'LL CALL YOU IF WE NEED YOU: EXPERIENCES OF WOMEN WORKING
CONSTRUCTION &LR;  By Susan Eisenberg. ILR/Cornell University, $14.95.
Using firsthand accounts, a master electrician and poet celebrates
the feminist pioneers who braved abuse and even mortal danger to
enter the building trades in the late 1970s. ``This is an
inspirational, life-affirming book,'' Samuel C. Florman wrote in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AMERICAN BANDSTAND: DICK CLARK AND THE MAKING OF A ROCK 'N'
ROLL EMPIRE &LR;  By John A. Jackson. Oxford University, $16.95. This
account of the television hit that put rock 'n' roll on the
pop-culture map portrays its bland but cunning host as one of
rock's kingmakers in the 1950s and '60s. In 1997 the reviewer Fred
Goodman called this an ``evenhanded and carefully researched''
book.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHY THE TREE LOVES THE AX &LR;  By Jim Lewis. Berkley, $12.95. A
mysterious woman settles in a sleepy Texas town after miraculously
surviving a car accident, but finds she can't shake her troubled
past. Last year the reviewer Sarah Ferguson called this a
``haunting exploration of memory and identity.''

   JERUSALEM _ The warm and fuzzies have vanished from peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
   There is a cold-blooded quality to the resolution of ethnic and
territorial conflicts in today's world. Rosy visions of
multi-ethnic harmony, often imposed by outsiders, have turned
steely. Even the impulse to provide such visions as window-dressing
seems to be gone _ from the Balkans, Northern Ireland and the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Ehud Barak, the new prime minister of Israel, is determined to
be the great peacemaker of his country's history, to resolve
century-old conflicts once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   But the former general, while he has traded in his olive drabs
for an olive branch, does not spout a vision that could even
remotely be considered utopian. His hard-nosed peace, which he
presented to President Clinton in Washington last week, sounds less
like something positive and more like a double negative: not war.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, leader of the Labor Party, talks bluntly about putting up
``high fences'' between Israel and its neighbors. He primarily
describes peace as a way to enhance Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
   It is a baldly grim message compared with the idealism about
regional cooperation, even harmony, voiced by predecessors who
chose to wear the mantle of peacemaker. Barak's campaign pledge to
``separate'' from the Palestinians summed it up with a starkly
unromantic slogan: ``We are here, and they will be over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in the Balkans, there is very little official talk
any more of forging or recreating mixed societies. In 1995, Tito's
dream of unifying the South Slavs got a final nod in the Dayton
peace accords, which, for public relations purposes, were wrapped
in the rhetoric of harmony. But with Bosnia now rigidly divided and
the Serbs exiting Kosovo, there is little pretense of establishing
Serbian-Albanian friendship leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Even as it urges Serbs not to leave, NATO is reconciled to
separating peoples.
</P>
<P>
   It could be argued that peace has always been more about
exhaustion than aspiration. Belligerent parties finally realize
they are not going to reach their objectives through armed
conflicts; their people are tired of paying the price of sustained
warfare.
</P>
<P>
   But there does seem to be a change in the air, a new pragmatism
that sees the hopeful dream of peace with harmony as naive, even as
an obstacle to ending conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is a kind of battle fatigue with peacemaking, too;
conflicting peoples would just as soon carve out a conflict-free
zone and be done with it.
</P>
<P>
   In Northern Ireland, peace the concept has become truce the
(near) reality. Talk of integrating schools and sports has given
way to divvying up parliamentary spoils and ``decommissioning''
paramilitary weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to two Irish women,
Mairead Corrigan and Betty Williams, grass-roots peace activists
who preached inter-religious reconciliation _ and led a movement
that went nowhere. Last year's Nobel Peace Prize celebrated two
unapologetic partisans _ David Trimble, the Unionist leader, and
John Hume, the Irish Republican leader _ who attempt no straddling
of worlds.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the continuing strains brought the pact close to a
breaking point when Trimble refused to let members of a new
power-sharing Cabinet be named unless the Irish Republican Army
began to disarm. Such is the tense and guarded quality of this
peace.
</P>
<P>
   In the Mideast, Barak is not playing games with his tough talk.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran of Israeli-Arab battlefields and someone who
personally led missions to assassinate Palestinian terrorists, he
is not inclined to hold hands with Yasser Arafat and sing
``Kumbaya.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Barak could not bring himself to echo
Arafat's description of him as ``friend and partner.'' He raised
his eyebrows, said Arafat was not exactly a card-carrying member of
the B'nai B'rith and settled on ``partnerish rival'' to describe
him.
</P>
<P>
   But, beyond his personal feelings, Barak is also acting in a
perfectly calculated manner. As a leader, he does not want to go
beyond what the body politic can endorse. And he has decided that
the Israeli public cannot unite around a utopian notion of
peacemaking.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Following in the footsteps of Yitzhak Rabin, who was
assassinated by a right-wing extremist in 1995, any Israeli leader
intent on forging peace agreements is going to tread cautiously
through the ideological minefields.
</P>
<P>
   For Barak to dress up his peacemaking as a visionary thing would
be to risk violent social unrest at the worst or to face political
paralysis at best. Israelis are prepared to swallow the bitter pill
of making territorial concessions to the Palestinians and even to
the Syrians. Like Barak, they are ready to free Israel of what he
calls the ``burden of ruling the Palestinians.''
</P>
<P>
   They are not ready to take down the barbed wire.
</P>
<P>
   This hard-bitten approach mediates between the grand neighborly
visions of some of Barak's leftist predecessors and the hostile
skepticism of the prime minister he defeated, Benjamin Netanyahu,
who said he believed in peace but never sounded conciliatory.
</P>
<P>
   No less than Theodor Herzl, Israel's founder, envisioned a
commercially integrated Middle East, although his writings reveal a
keen colonialist mentality. (``The creation of our state would be
beneficial to other countries,'' he wrote.)
</P>
<P>
   Decades later, when Abba Eban addressed the United Nations in
1967, he had a fully realized dream. ``In peaceful conditions, we
could imagine communications running from Haifa to Beirut and
Damascus in the north, to Amman and beyond in the east, and to
Cairo in the south,'' he said. ``The opening of these blocked
arteries would stimulate the life, thought and commerce in the
region beyond any level otherwise conceivable.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the unsentimental Rabin, Barak's mentor, spoke of ``turning
swords into plowshares'' and forging an economically integrated
region.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Shimon Peres, first as foreign minister under Yitzhak
Rabin and then as the prime minister after Rabin's assassination,
who became the Israeli leader most associated with the utopian
vision of peace with harmony.
</P>
<P>
   Peres scoffed at and continues to scoff at the notion of high
fences. He coined the idea of a New Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, he was mocked by many for his lofty thinking; one
remark _ that hotels would be of greater strategic importance than
checkpoints on Israel's borders _ is still repeated by his
detractors with contempt.
</P>
<P>
   But the reality of what is likely to transpire falls somewhere
between Barak's and Peres' visions.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what Barak says, the fact is that the Palestinians and
the Israelis are not ``here'' and ``there,'' not with settlements
dotting the West Bank and a large Palestinian population living in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   In the immediate future, there is no real way to dissociate the
two, not when Israel mans the borders, collects the taxes, employs
100,000 Palestinian laborers and depends economically on
Palestinian consumers. And there will have to be cooperation if not
collaboration _ on security, on the millennial tourism business,
and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Barak may be calling greater attention to building fences than
bridges, but his new industry and trade minister, Ran Cohen, said
he plans to build industry zones ``in a massive way'' on the
borders between Israel and the Palestinian territories and perhaps
between Israel and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is peace without economic agreements?'' Cohen said in an
interview. ``Prime Minister Barak may not be highlighting it, but
it is self-evident that this lies in our future.''
</P>
<P>
   On a grass-roots level, too, there are scores of local
people-to-people projects that suddenly feel very free to flourish,
from collaborations between Israeli and Palestinian firefighters,
birdwatchers and tour guides to recent Internet chat sessions
between Israeli and Lebanese teen-agers discussing the bombardment
of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground, then, the hard-nosed vision may be softened by
those infected with the more idealistic view of peace, or with what
Rabin referred to as the profit motive. ``No one will come here
because of our winning smiles,'' he said at an economic summit in
Amman. ``They all want to make money.''

way to divvying up parliamentary spoils and ``decommissioning''
paramilitary weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to two Irish women,
Mairead Corrigan and Betty Williams, grass-roots peace activists
who preached inter-religious reconciliation _ and led a movement
that went nowhere. Last year's Nobel Peace Prize celebrated two
unapologetic partisans _ David Trimble, the Unionist leader, and
John Hume, the Irish Republican leader _ who attempt no straddling
of worlds.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the continuing strains brought the pact close to a
breaking point when Trimble refused to let members of a new
power-sharing Cabinet be named unless the Irish Republican Army
began to disarm. Such is the tense and guarded quality of this
peace.
</P>
<P>
   In the Mideast, Barak is not playing games with his tough talk.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran of Israeli-Arab battlefields and someone who
personally led missions to assassinate Palestinian terrorists, he
is not inclined to hold hands with Yasser Arafat and sing
``Kumbaya.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Barak could not bring himself to echo
Arafat's description of him as ``friend and partner.'' He raised
his eyebrows, said Arafat was not exactly a card-carrying member of
the B'nai B'rith and settled on ``partnerish rival'' to describe
him.
</P>
<P>
   But, beyond his personal feelings, Barak is also acting in a
perfectly calculated manner. As a leader, he does not want to go
beyond what the body politic can endorse. And he has decided that
the Israeli public cannot unite around a utopian notion of
peacemaking.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Following in the footsteps of Yitzhak Rabin, who was
assassinated by a right-wing extremist in 1995, any Israeli leader
intent on forging peace agreements is going to tread cautiously
through the ideological minefields.
</P>
<P>
   For Barak to dress up his peacemaking as a visionary thing would
be to risk violent social unrest at the worst or to face political
paralysis at best. Israelis are prepared to swallow the bitter pill
of making territorial concessions to the Palestinians and even to
the Syrians. Like Barak, they are ready to free Israel of what he
calls the ``burden of ruling the Palestinians.''
</P>
<P>
   They are not ready to take down the barbed wire.
</P>
<P>
   This hard-bitten approach mediates between the grand neighborly
visions of some of Barak's leftist predecessors and the hostile
skepticism of the prime minister he defeated, Benjamin Netanyahu,
who said he believed in peace but never sounded conciliatory.
</P>
<P>
   No less than Theodor Herzl, Israel's founder, envisioned a
commercially integrated Middle East, although his writings reveal a
keen colonialist mentality. (``The creation of our state would be
beneficial to other countries,'' he wrote.)
</P>
<P>
   Decades later, when Abba Eban addressed the United Nations in
1967, he had a fully realized dream. ``In peaceful conditions, we
could imagine communications running from Haifa to Beirut and
Damascus in the north, to Amman and beyond in the east, and to
Cairo in the south,'' he said. ``The opening of these blocked
arteries would stimulate the life, thought and commerce in the
region beyond any level otherwise conceivable.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the unsentimental Rabin, Barak's mentor, spoke of ``turning
swords into plowshares'' and forging an economically integrated
region.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Shimon Peres, first as foreign minister under Yitzhak
Rabin and then as the prime minister after Rabin's assassination,
who became the Israeli leader most associated with the utopian
vision of peace with harmony.
</P>
<P>
   Peres scoffed at and continues to scoff at the notion of high
fences. He coined the idea of a New Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, he was mocked by many for his lofty thinking; one
remark _ that hotels would be of greater strategic importance than
checkpoints on Israel's borders _ is still repeated by his
detractors with contempt.
</P>
<P>
   But the reality of what is likely to transpire falls somewhere
between Barak's and Peres' visions.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what Barak says, the fact is that the Palestinians and
the Israelis are not ``here'' and ``there,'' not with settlements
dotting the West Bank and a large Palestinian population living in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   In the immediate future, there is no real way to dissociate the
two, not when Israel mans the borders, collects the taxes, employs
100,000 Palestinian laborers and depends economically on
Palestinian consumers. And there will have to be cooperation if not
collaboration _ on security, on the millennial tourism business,
and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Barak may be calling greater attention to building fences than
bridges, but his new industry and trade minister, Ran Cohen, said
he plans to build industry zones ``in a massive way'' on the
borders between Israel and the Palestinian territories and perhaps
between Israel and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is peace without economic agreements?'' Cohen said in an
interview. ``Prime Minister Barak may not be highlighting it, but
it is self-evident that this lies in our future.''
</P>
<P>
   On a grass-roots level, too, there are scores of local
people-to-people projects that suddenly feel very free to flourish,
from collaborations between Israeli and Palestinian firefighters,
birdwatchers and tour guides to recent Internet chat sessions
between Israeli and Lebanese teen-agers discussing the bombardment
of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground, then, the hard-nosed vision may be softened by
those infected with the more idealistic view of peace, or with what
Rabin referred to as the profit motive. ``No one will come here
because of our winning smiles,'' he said at an economic summit in
Amman. ``They all want to make money.''

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the nonfiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending July 10 at
almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other
retailers, statistically weighted to represent sales in all such

subdivisions of nonfiction can change from week to week, reflecting
changes in book buying.

   Race-Based Busing Ends in Boston
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago, riots and rocks and beatings turned
Boston into the epicenter of national turmoil over busing ordered
by the courts to speed school desegregation. Now the Boston School
Committee has ended the last vestiges of that era by voting, 5-2,
to drop race as a factor in deciding which school a pupil would
attend.
</P>
<P>
   School officials, who have been examining the Boston school
assignment system for years, said they had to act quickly and
decisively because of a pending lawsuit by parents who say the
system discriminates against white children by giving them less
choice of which school to attend.
</P>
<P>
   But that did not keep some two dozen parents and advocates at
the committee's meeting from protesting that Boston was still far
from desegregated. Supporters of the move countered that they
wanted to focus less on race and more on improving education for
all.

   A Doctor Is Forced To Heal Herself
</P>
<P>
   An Air Force jet flew an emergency mission over the South Pole
last Sunday to drop medical supplies for a member of a research
team who discovered a lump in her breast. But the case is more
difficult than government researchers revealed: the patient will
have to treat herself, because she is the only doctor on the
41-member team at the isolated Antarctic base. Her diagnosis has
not been disclosed. Because of harsh winter conditions, she cannot
be flown out until October or November.

   Cruise Line Discloses Sexual Assault Cases
</P>
<P>
   Carnival, the world's biggest cruise company, disclosed in court
papers that its crew members had been accused of sexually
assaulting passengers and fellow workers 62 times in a five-year
period that ended last August. Though details on the incidents were
sparse, it was the first time anyone in the cruise industry had
disclosed statistics on shipboard crime.
</P>
<P>
   A company lawyer said the figures demonstrated that Carnival
ships are relatively safe. But lawyers for the people who claimed
to be victims, along with Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and chairman
of the Commerce Committee, disagreed with that interpretation and
called on the industry to make a fuller disclosure of crimes.

   U.S. Sues Toyota
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department sued Toyota on Monday, accusing it of
violating the Clean Air Act and seeking fines that could, in
theory, approach $60 billion, although any actual verdict or
settlement would almost certainly be far less.
</P>
<P>
   The government contends that Toyota did not properly program the
``check engine'' light on the dashboards of most 1996 to 1998 model
Toyota and Lexus automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   The lights would illuminate during regulators' laboratory tests,
but would not turn on during street driving even if traces of
gasoline vapor were leaking from fuel lines and the gas cap, the
lawsuit said. Toyota said that regulations only required the lights
to work during lab tests.

   A Vaccine Is Halted
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, health workers were elated when the first vaccine
against rotavirus, the most common cause of severe diarrhea in
infants and young children, was licensed and recommended for all
infants in this country. But the joy has now been muted; federal
health officials called for immediate suspension of the vaccine
because post-marketing monitoring suggested a link between it and
20 non-fatal cases of a painful blockage of the bowel called
intussusception.

   British Beef Readmitted To the World's Markets
</P>
<P>
   The European Commission lifted the worldwide ban on British beef
exports that it imposed three years ago after an epidemic of a
brain malady in cattle known as mad cow disease (bovine spongiform
encephalopathy) was found to be responsible for transmitting a
related brain-wasting disorder (new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease) to humans.
</P>
<P>
   Regulated feed, new standards for slaughterhouse hygiene and
computer tracking of herds are now in place to restore the good
name of a signature product in Britain. The country, after all, was
once so associated with red meat in Europe that Britons were known
in French as ``les rosbifs.''

   A New Regimen To Fight AIDS in Newborns
</P>
<P>
   Developing countries have long sought a simple, affordable way
to prevent mother-to-child transmission of the AIDS virus. A study
reported from Uganda last week suggested that it may be a drug,
nevirapine, that has been marketed in the United States since 1996.
Both mother and newborn take nevirapine once _ the mother during
labor and the baby by the third day of life. The total cost is $4.
</P>
<P>
   Because AIDS prevention also requires testing and counseling,
which are scarce in the Third World, experts urged pilot studies of
such combinations before widespread use of nevirapine.
</P>
<P>
   The advance comes at a time when African leaders, mostly silent
for nearly two decades, have begun to speak out against AIDS.
Meanwhile, AIDS has become Africa's leading killer.

   Refugees Say Goodbye to an Army Post
</P>
<P>
   With the last refugees from Kosovo expected to leave in the
coming days, Fort Dix prepared to end its brief life as a gateway
for victims of ethnic cleansing, and go back to being a training
camp for military rservists.
</P>
<P>
   More than 4,000 Albanian Kosovars came through Fort Dix starting
in early May; immigration, health and police authorities used the
post to screen the newcomers before resettling them in 40 states.
Another 5,000 refugees, some with relatives already in the United
States, came in through Kennedy Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The plight of the Kosovar refugees touched ordinary Americans,
who stepped forward in great numbers with donations and offers to
take in families, while communities vied to sponsor them, according
to resettlement workers. Though the United States pledged to take
in 20,000 Kosovars, the war's swift end has let it close down
resettlement efforts at less than half that number.

   A Fugitive Is Found
</P>
<P>
   After months of eluding the authorities, who had linked him with
eight brutal killings in Texas, Illinois and Kentucky, Angel
Maturino Resendez, a Mexican drifter with a fondness for aliases,
disguises and travel by freight train gave himself up in El Paso,
Texas, after his sister negotiated his surrender with a Texas
Ranger.
</P>
<P>
   While Maturino Resendez, who had been known to his pursuers as
Rafael Resendez Ramirez, was being arraigned in a Houston court,
officials said evidence had surfaced that could connect him with a
ninth murder.

   Bush Forgoes Federal Funds to Avoid Spending Limit
</P>
<P>
   Politicians these days are raking in huge gobs of campaign cash,
more than ever before. So when a presidential candidate turns down
$16.5 million, there can only be one explanation: It's not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas announced he would not accept
federal money to finance his campaign for the Republican
nomination. That's because he wants to cut the strings attached to
the federal gift: restrictions on the amount he can spend.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates who accept federal money can't spend more than $40
million. But Bush has already collected $37 million _ seven months
shy of the first primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said avoiding spending limits would allow him to respond to
attacks by a wealthy Republican rival. That would seem to be Steve
Forbes, the multimillionaire publisher, who has already announced
he would not accept matching funds for the 2000 primary season.
</P>
<P>
   The Other Prime Minister's Visit
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the Israeli prime minister's visit to Washington
last week, everything went swimmingly.
</P>
<P>
   Of course. Foreign leaders don't just show up at the White
House; these visits are painstakingly planned so there are no
unpleasant surprises. Ever.
</P>
<P>
   Except where there are.
</P>
<P>
   Another prime minister also dropped in on President Clinton last
week and things didn't work out quite so well.
</P>
<P>
   He was John Howard of Australia and his notion was to score a
few points back home by celebrating the friendship between
Washington and Canberra.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   Several days before he was due to arrive, the White House
announced that a 9 percent tariff would be slapped on Australian
lamb imports, and any imports above the current level would receive
an additional 40 percent tariff.
</P>
<P>
   There are few things closer to the Australian heart than a
roasted leg of lamb. More important, lamb is a major export, and
farmers remain a symbol of the Australian way of life. They are
also among the noisiest constituents an Australian politician can
face.
</P>
<P>
   So why did the president act just before the visit?
</P>
<P>
   Australian lamb, it turns out, has been doing so well on the
American market that sheep ranchers had begun to complain. More
than 30 senators, including Sen. Max S. Baucus, D-Mont., who
represents ranchers, wrote to the president asking him to decide in
favor of new tariffs. And he did.
</P>
<P>
   Howard, caught unawares, declared he was appalled and outraged.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian press was downright apoplectic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Damn Ewe!'' screamed The Daily Telegraph in Sydney. A
photograph of a sheep with Clinton's head superimposed accompanied
the article.
</P>
<P>
   Then the newspaper's New York correspondent was ordered to
Washington to find a live sheep. The reporter found a pet lamb and,
at his editor's request, tethered the animal to the White House
fence with a protest sign attached. The animal was duly
photographed.
</P>
<P>
   The next day at the White House, Howard's 20-minute audience
with Clinton was dominated not by discussion of friendship and new
defense arrangements, but by talk of meat.
</P>
<P>
   _ JANE PERLEZ
</P>
<P>
   Thinking Small. Real Small.
</P>
<P>
   As remarkable as today's supercomputers are, they may seem like
Model-T's in less than a decade. Scientists say they have taken the
first tentative steps into a world of computing that would be far
smaller and faster than today's silicon-based machines.
</P>
<P>
   By shrinking computer switches into the Lilliputian world of
individual molecules and atoms, researchers have raised the
possibility of building machines so small that they could navigate
human blood vessels hunting for diseases or create supercomputers
so powerful that they might be 100 billion times faster than
today's machines.
</P>
<P>
   A team of researchers from Hewlett Packard and the University of
California at Los Angeles reported in Science magazine that they
have succeeded in building tiny electronic switches no wider than a
single molecule.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers said there is still much experimentation needed
to create complete computers from the tiny new switches.
</P>
<P>
   For example, they have yet to figure out how to hook the
switches together into vast arrays. And there are still skeptics
who believe that building machines from individual molecules will
always remain a science fiction tale.
</P>
<P>
   But the new molecular switches are a promising first step. If
nothing else, they suggest that if there are limits in the world of
microelectronics that may one day slow the advance in computing
power, they may not be reached for many decades.
</P>
<P>
   _ JOHN MARKOFF
</P>
<P>
   No Fishing
</P>
<P>
   Church and state, forever separate _ that's American bedrock. No
city would dare, say, depict Jesus on a town hall banner. But as
with any self-respecting issue, vast gray areas emerge. If two
lines cross in a town logo, some will see a Christian symbol;
others, well, two lines crossing.
</P>
<P>
   Republic, Mo., has a fish symbol in its official seal. Is this
fish just a fish? Apparently not. The seal's designer said the
symbol represented all religion. But some saw an ancient Christian
symbol and demanded its removal, prompting a bizarre legal battle.
Backers of the fish, even as they acknowledged its religious
overtones, tried to prove it predated Christianity. And local
manicurists painted fish on customers' nails _ presumably with
their permission.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the American Civil Liberties Union, representing a
local believer in witchcraft, won the day, as a federal judge ruled
that it was indeed a ``Christian fish'' and had to go.

   WASHINGTON _ It is impossible to pinpoint the moment when
America's successes in the 1990s moved from a topic of grudging
admiration around the world to a constant source of annoyance at
Washington's triumphalism to a rationale for mistrust and
resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the clincher was envy over the Dow's dramatic ascent
from a little over 2,000 at the start of the decade to a little
over 11,000 this year. Maybe it was the dawning realization that
people around the globe are all flicking on the same Windows
operating system in the morning, on their way to navigating an
Internet dominated by U.S. innovations and businesses and driven by
Intel inside everything. Maybe it was when the United States, in
the wake of the Asian economic crisis, began offering tutorials on
American-style capitalism, and insisting that the world's financial
architecture be rebuilt to American building codes.
</P>
<P>
   But surely the capstone was Kosovo. Whether Washington intended
this outcome or not, the war demonstrated to allies and potential
adversaries alike how much more formidable U.S. military technology
has become since the Persian Gulf War. Europeans got a rude
awakening when they learned that the gap between the United States'
capability and their own had so widened that they now have to
rethink their we'll-build-it-on-the-Continent mentality.
</P>
<P>
   And nothing sent a greater chill through the Kremlin and the
Chinese leaders' compound next to the Forbidden City than the image
of those B-2 bombers lazily lifting into the air over Missouri at
midday, flying an 11,000-mile, 32-hour mission to drop laser-guided
weapons over Belgrade, Yugoslavia _ and getting back in time for
dinner the next evening. Feeling the need to stake out some ground,
Moscow hastily flew a ragtag force into Kosovo, and Beijing boasted
last week that it had the neutron bomb _ don't-mess-with-us
messages that undercut the Clinton administration's talk of
strategic partnerships with old Cold War adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the world looks very different to Americans, who have
already moved beyond the Kosovo war. In the national self-image,
America's pillars of global power _ unparalleled financial clout,
unmatched technological prowess and unchallenged military reach _
are separate entities, bits of a far more fragile mosaic. Sure,
times are good, but Americans don't feel particularly powerful now,
even with the Russians broke, the Chinese consumed with
unemployment and slowing growth, and the Japanese unable to get
their breath back.
</P>
<P>
   But talk to Thai politicians stewing over what they view as an
American conspiracy to keep their candidate from running the World
Trade Organization, or scan the People's Daily, or listen to talk
radio in Toronto, and it becomes clear that America's triple threat
_ the dollar, the Pentium III chip and the B-2 _ is now also its
biggest diplomatic challenge. It may be a case of being too
powerful for one's own good.
</P>
<P>
   Or as Michael Mandelbaum, a professor at Johns Hopkins
University, puts it, ``If you are the 800-pound gorilla, you're
concentrating on your bananas, and everyone else is concentrating
on you.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the reactions differ dramatically when America talks
to friends like the Western Europeans and to potentially hostile
powers. Nonetheless, officials at the State Department, the
Treasury and the Pentagon, who agree on precious little, all say
fear of America's widening lead has become the subtext of nearly
every major conversation they hold around the world.
</P>
<P>
   It underlies Europe's near-panic over the precipitous fall of
the euro, the new currency meant to represent a more economically
powerful Europe. And it underlies Russia's perpetual negotiations
to avoid national default, in which Moscow fights every step of the
way as the International Monetary Fund _ synonymous with Washington
in the Russian view _ demands economic reforms in return for aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need is a policy of strategic reassurance,'' a Clinton
administration official lamented, ``a way of demonstrating that not
only is this power benign, but that it isn't a zero-sum game.''

</P>
<P>
   But turning that desire into policy isn't easy. The new treasury
secretary, Lawrence Summers, warns against trying to fix the world,
noting that ``we cannot want prosperity and reform in any country
more than its people do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our challenge,'' he says, ``to succeed as the first
outward-looking, non-imperialist, continental superpower.'' The
unspoken comparison is with the old Soviet Union, which was
continental but expansionist and the continental but inward-looking
China.
</P>
<P>
   From other capitals, though, Washington doesn't look so benign.
Its push for more open markets around the world is often viewed as
nice ideological justification for speeding the pace at which more
efficient U.S. companies can drive their foreign competition into
the ground. Meanwhile, the White House jumps when U.S. companies
complain that low-cost imports are hurting U.S. workers: In the
past two weeks alone, Washington has announced restrictions on
cheap steel from Russia and Brazil and cheap lamb from Australia
and New Zealand. No matter how it defends such moves as legal
responses to ``dumping,'' from overseas it looks more like
protectionism.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that is puzzlement over the deliberately vague
``Clinton Doctrine.'' It doesn't get much press in the United
States, but everywhere else there is speculation over how far the
Americans might extend the principles of Kosovo, intervening inside
other nations' borders to enforce ``international values'' of
humanitarian treatment or human rights. Russia looks at Kosovo and
worries about Chechnya; China looks at it and worries about Tibet
and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   An intense decade of global competition and technological
innovation has only heightened the contrast between America's view
of its power and the very different view held by the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans struggling with 12 percent unemployment and Japanese
trying to emerge from a lost decade look at America's surging
markets and employment rolls and see a train speeding by so fast
that it looks uncatchable. When Americans look at the same facts,
many get as queasy as Alan Greenspan, wondering how long the boom
can last. (That insecurity, some economists think, has actually
helped spur America's growth, sustaining the pressure for
cost-cutting and productivity gains.)

   When foreign companies look at the pace of U.S. technological
development, they see a gap far greater than a decade ago. But
American corporate executives look over their shoulders and worry.
``You sense quite the opposite of triumphalism from CEOs,'' said
Jeffrey Garten, the dean of the Yale School of Management. ``They
feel they are in a brutally competitive world, and they think they
are in a race for their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The developing world holds a similar fear. The U.N. Development
Program issued a report last week arguing that the digital divide
is widening faster than ever. Twenty-six percent of Americans use
the World Wide Web, it said, compared to 3 percent of Russians and
a tiny fraction of a percent of the population of South Asia. The
United States has more computers than the rest of the world
combined. In other words, the faster rich nations log on, the
further they pull ahead of countries that aren't even plugged in.
But the closest the report came to advocating a solution was a
1-cent tax on long e-mails, with the revenue earmarked for
connecting up the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The perception gap grows whenever the subject turns to the
lessons of Kosovo and U.S. military power. Washington looks back at
the events of the spring and wipes its brow, relieved that it got
through with negligible casualties and no ground troops. It sees a
truly multinational mission: After all, there was Prime Minister
Tony Blair, feeling his oats, arguing for ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   The European allies emerged with a different view: The war was
won with U.S. air power that homegrown military technology cannot
match. Meeting last week in Washington to review the war, European
defense contractors and officials concluded that trans-Atlantic
mergers of defense contractors _ something both Europe and America
have long resisted _ are now inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese saw Kosovo through another lens. When Thomas
Pickering, the under secretary of state, went to Beijing last month
to explain the series of mistakes that led to the accidental
bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, a senior Chinese
official said China believed that the United States was involved in
Kosovo simply to test its latest armaments, according to U.S.
officials who have reviewed transcripts of the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that we appreciate how this integration of
financial, military and technological power looks from the
outside,'' said Gerrit Gong, the director of Asian studies at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies. ``It makes random,
unconnected events seem like part of a plan for America to hog the
road.''
</P>
<P>
   This may be a problem without a solution. Perhaps it could be
eased with a little less talk of America as the ``indispensable
nation'' _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's phrase _ and a
little more attention to sharing technology and the wealth it
creates.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, is not exactly the mood that Congress is in. Nor
is the administration so inclined; it is trying to get through its
last 18 months with no more ethnic wars, no more economic collapses
around the globe and no abrupt end to the age of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economic progress is a Faustian bargain,'' concludes
Mandelbaum. ``You gain a lot, you pay a price. That's what
international politics is all about.''

 WASHINGTON: zero-sum game''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   But turning that desire into policy isn't easy. The new treasury
secretary, Lawrence Summers, warns against trying to fix the world,
noting that ``we cannot want prosperity and reform in any country
more than its people do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our challenge,'' he says, ``to succeed as the first
outward-looking, non-imperialist, continental superpower.'' The
unspoken comparison is with the old Soviet Union, which was
continental but expansionist and the continental but inward-looking
China.
</P>
<P>
   From other capitals, though, Washington doesn't look so benign.
Its push for more open markets around the world is often viewed as
nice ideological justification for speeding the pace at which more
efficient U.S. companies can drive their foreign competition into
the ground. Meanwhile, the White House jumps when U.S. companies
complain that low-cost imports are hurting U.S. workers: In the
past two weeks alone, Washington has announced restrictions on
cheap steel from Russia and Brazil and cheap lamb from Australia
and New Zealand. No matter how it defends such moves as legal
responses to ``dumping,'' from overseas it looks more like
protectionism.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that is puzzlement over the deliberately vague
``Clinton Doctrine.'' It doesn't get much press in the United
States, but everywhere else there is speculation over how far the
Americans might extend the principles of Kosovo, intervening inside
other nations' borders to enforce ``international values'' of
humanitarian treatment or human rights. Russia looks at Kosovo and
worries about Chechnya; China looks at it and worries about Tibet
and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   An intense decade of global competition and technological
innovation has only heightened the contrast between America's view
of its power and the very different view held by the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans struggling with 12 percent unemployment and Japanese
trying to emerge from a lost decade look at America's surging
markets and employment rolls and see a train speeding by so fast
that it looks uncatchable. When Americans look at the same facts,
many get as queasy as Alan Greenspan, wondering how long the boom
can last. (That insecurity, some economists think, has actually
helped spur America's growth, sustaining the pressure for
cost-cutting and productivity gains.)

<P>
   SUPERPOWER-REVIEW _ It is hard to pinpoint the moment when
America's successes in the 1990s moved from a subject of grudging
admiration in capitals around the world, to a source of annoyance
at Washington's triumphal-sounding pronouncements, to a cause of
real apprehension. But surely the capstone came with Kosovo.
Intentionally or not it demonstrated to allies and potential
adversaries alike how the Americans had exploited new military
technologies since the Gulf War. By David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   (Story has moved in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-BARAK-REVIEW (Jerusalem) _ Ehud Barak, the new prime
minister of Israel, is determined to be the great peacemaker of his
country's history, to resolve century-old conflicts once and for
all. But the former general does not spout a vision that could even
remotely be considered utopian. By Deborah Sontag.
</P>
<P>
   (Story has moved in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-REVIEW (Tehran, Iran) _ Things are not always what they
seem in this country of high walls and black veils. Invasions,
occupations, foreign meddling and arbitrary rule over the centuries
have scarred the collective memory of the Iranian people and taught
them keys to survival: improvisation, role-playing and even
deception. By Elaine Sciolino.

</P>
<P>
   TAIWAN-CHINA-REVIEW (Beijing) _ Here's a riddle: How do you make
a country richer and more democratic and at the same time
outmaneuver a huge, luggish neighbor that wants to ``reunify'' with
you? Here's an answer (and Beijing won't like this): ask the
president of Taiwan, Lee Teng-hui. By Seth Faison.

<P>
   BOSNIA-REVIEW (Srebrenica, Bosnia-Herzegovina) _ Four years ago
this month, Bosnian Serb soldiers hunted down and killed as many as
7,000 mostly unarmed Muslim men in the rugged hills surrounding
Srebrenica, a town the United Nations declared a ``safe area'' and
vowed to protect. Since the war ended in 1995, local Serb
nationalists have used tactics ranging from endless negotiations to
rock-throwing mobs to prevent the town council from meeting. But in
a scene difficult to imagine only a few months ago, two dozen
Muslim politicians calmly sat down with 20 of their Serb
counterparts in the lobby of a local hotel on June 29 and held the
inaugural session of the town council of what they called the
``near Srebrenica.'' By David Rohde.
</P>
<P>
   (Story has moved in ``i' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   EMBASSY-CLOSINGS-REVIEW (Washington) _ The closing of American
embassies, those flag-flying symbols of American power and
influence, was once about as common as a snowstorm on the
palm-shaded beaches of Madagascar. But in the year since terrorist
bombs destroyed American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, 67
American embassies and consulates have been closed for some period
of time for security reasons. By Philip Shenon.
</P>
<P>
   (Story has moved in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   RECYCLED-TV-REVIEW _ These days, it's no longer a question of
which television shows, no matter how crummy, become movies. The
question now is which ones don't. And the answer, increasingly, is
precious few. By Thomas Vinciguerra.
</P>
<P>
   (Story has moved in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   PUNITIVE-DAMAGES-REVIEW _ Sending messages is the purpose of
punitive damages, defined by law as punishment for especially
outrageous conduct. But do juries go too far? By William Glaberson.
</P>
<P>
   (Story has moved in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   AIRLINE-SAFETY-REVIEW (Washington) _ Pleas for justice are
routine after an airplane crash, and they are generally played out
in civil courts, where survivors and relatives of victims sue for
damages. But last week, in a surprising move, prosecutors won
criminal indictments against a maintenance company, two mechanics
and a superior in the crash of a Valujet plane in the Everglades in
1996. By Matthew L. Wald.
</P>
<P>
   (Story has moved in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   HEALTH-CARE-REVIEW (Washington) _ After listening to the
rancorous debate in the Senate over health-care reform last week,
it would seem obvious that differences between Democrats and
Republicans are profound. But removed from the context of
election-year politics, combatants on both sides make it clear
there is plenty of room to compromise on a way to give Americans
some protection from health-care plans that wrongly skimp on
coverage. By Michael Weinstein.
</P>
<P>
   (Story has moved in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   RELIGION-BILLBOARDS-REVIEW _ Whether it rains or freezes, and
even if you don't have a plastic Jesus on the dashboard of your
car, you might have a hard time avoiding reminders of the Lord on
highways across the country this summer. Since last fall,
billboards and signs bearing specific messages have appeared on
roads in some 40 states from Alaska to Texas. But not everyone's
ecstatic. By Tom Kuntz.

SHADOW DRAMA IN IRAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(jt) 
 By ELAINE SCIOLINO    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ Things are not always what they seem in this
country of high walls and black veils. Invasions, occupations,
foreign meddling and arbitrary rule over the centuries have have
made politics a dangerous game, and Iranians have learned some
survival strategies: improvisation, role-playing and even
deception.
</P>
<P>
   So it was natural that the unrest last week in Iran, the worst
since the early days of its 1979 revolution, produced images that
sometimes betrayed reality: There were students who didn't look
like students, policemen who didn't look like policemen, true
believers who weren't really true believers.
</P>
<P>
   Masquerade is a large part of the Iranian reality, and it helps
explain why events unfolded here with such a baffling series of
turnabouts and surprises: One day tens of thousands of protesting
students were in the streets, chanting for more freedom. The next
day an even larger crowd, summoned by conservatives, denounced the
students. And the following day a near-normal calm settled over the
streets, almost as if nothing had happened.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis started when students at Tehran University
demonstrated to protest a tough new press code and the closing of
Salam, a popular newspaper supportive of Iran's reformist
president, Mohammed Khatami. Islamic vigilantes and security forces
stormed a dormitory, beating students as they slept and pushing
some from windows.
</P>
<P>
   For six days students _ whose ranks were probably infiltrated by
their enemies _ took to the streets, but the demonstrations
deteriorated into rioting; security forces and street thugs used as
surrogates swept the demonstrators off the streets with tear gas
and truncheons. Huge crowds followed up with government-organized
counter-demonstrations. This time the students stayed home.
</P>
<P>
   And then, as if a cloak had been swept over the events, a new
quiet left it difficult to figure out who had won or lost or where
or when the next battle would take place.
</P>
<P>
   One way to look at these events is as the latest scenes in a
national epic drama. The students' frustrations with the strict
Islamic system have been building for years. But before last week,
they were mostly expressed in private, much as the conflict between
Khatami's followers and Islamic conservatives has developed behind
the scenes. Once the frustrations burst into public view, the
play-acting that infuses much of Iranian politics accelerated the
chain of events, with each side reaching for the most dramatic _
even overdrawn _ way to make its point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iranians are like wheat fields,'' one saying goes. ``When the
storm comes, they bend; when the storm passes, they stand up
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Another goes: ``Iranians are like water in a vase. If the vase
is a globe, they become a globe; if the vase is long-necked, they
become long-necked.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for example, how Iran deals with Hafez, its great
medieval lyrical poet. He wrote love poetry in which lines of the
Koran are interspersed with lines about red-lipped, big-breasted
women and the pleasures of drink. When young Iranians study Hafez
in school, they are told that the wine he discussed was not an
alcoholic drink that caused intoxication but a divine drink that
caused mystical rapture. Even Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the
stern father of Iran's revolution, wrote Hafez-like love poetry. No
one would dare say he wrote about real women and real drink.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden about-face, too, is a familiar part of Iranian
history. On Aug. 2, 1953, 2.5 million people heeded the call of
their nationalist prime minister, Mohammed Mossadegh, and voted to
dissolve a Parliament he called obstructionist.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen days later, tanks poured into the streets in a coup
d'etat financed by the Central Intelligence Agency that ousted
Mossadegh and restored the monarchy.
</P>
<P>
   That day, his supporters stayed home.
</P>
<P>
   Often what is happening can be tolerated; the exposure of what
is happening cannot. ``Talk is more important than reality,'' said
one political analyst who, until the events of last week, was
accustomed to speaking outside the shelter of anonymity. ``Everyone
knows that dogs pee in graveyards. But one of the worst things you
can say to someone is, `A dog peed on your father's grave.'''
</P>
<P>
   So it was perfectly acceptable when people complained about
Iran's supreme-leader-for-life, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in private.
But when people appeared in the streets calling for the downfall of
dictators in general and for Ayatollah Khamenei's resignation in
particular, the regime had to reply _ not just by organizing the
counter-demonstration calling for the Ayatollah's long life, but by
playing images of that demonstration over and over on the
television system, which the Ayatollah controls.
</P>
<P>
   And it was perfectly understandable that the government switched
off Tehran's cellular telephones. Students involved in the
demonstrations on the whole were a privileged lot; they
communicated with each other, and with journalists, over their cell
phones.
</P>
<P>
   This was open talk, and it had to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating any effort to figure out who is who and what level
of protest is permissible is that Iran's clerical government is
split in two, but the sides have a lot in common.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's elected president has preached tolerance and the rule of
law. Ayatollah Khamenei cares more about keeping the revolution
Islamically strict and anti-Americanism high. And under the
Constitution, he holds more cards, controlling the armed forces,
intelligence and security apparatus, judiciary and radio and
television.
</P>
<P>
   But on television last week, the two men switched roles. Despite
his reformist message and friendly manner, Khatami is a cleric too,
and he is on record as supporting the Constitution and the concept
of supreme leader. As he has done before, he played the bad cop,
warning that the regime would do whatever it had to to keep order.
By contrast, the normally aloof, often strident Ayatollah Khamenei
played the loving father figure ready to sacrifice himself for his
children. At one point, he confessed mournfully that the violence
at the dormitory had broken his heart.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the other television images distorted reality. On the
day of the pro-government counter-demonstrations, television
broadcast footage of angry crowds from at least two dozen Iranian
towns and cities chanting ``Death to America.'' Paradoxically, the
streets were safest for Americans that day. Unlike the
unpredictability and chaos of the student protests, this
performance was planned and scripted, and the players knew just
what their roles were.
</P>
<P>
   It was left to the reformist newspapers to publish both sides of
the story and print the rest of the images, including photos of
students bloodied by vigilantes and female protesters crammed into
cages mounted on police cars.
</P>
<P>
   On the streets, what was safe one day was dangerous the next.
Iranian journalists who normally don't shave so they can blend in
with the Islamic purists on the streets decided to shave to fit in
with student demonstrators. When the purists took over again, the
journalists felt naked. Female journalists had it easier. They
could put on the black chador.
</P>
<P>
   Even reality itself deceived. A phalanx of young women swathed
in black chanting ``Death to America'' and punching the air with
their fists looked fearsome on the day of the anti-student
demonstration. Until one noticed their feet. They were wearing
high-heeled, high-soled shoes, fashionable in the West, dead
giveaways that they were not as Islamic as they were acting.

SHADOW DRAMA IN IRAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(jt) 
 By ELAINE SCIOLINO    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ Things are not always what they seem in this
country of high walls and black veils. Invasions, occupations,
foreign meddling and arbitrary rule over the centuries have have
made politics a dangerous game, and Iranians have learned some
survival strategies: improvisation, role-playing and even
deception.
</P>
<P>
   So it was natural that the unrest last week in Iran, the worst
since the early days of its 1979 revolution, produced images that
sometimes betrayed reality: There were students who didn't look
like students, policemen who didn't look like policemen, true
believers who weren't really true believers.
</P>
<P>
   Masquerade is a large part of the Iranian reality, and it helps
explain why events unfolded here with such a baffling series of
turnabouts and surprises: One day tens of thousands of protesting
students were in the streets, chanting for more freedom. The next
day an even larger crowd, summoned by conservatives, denounced the
students. And the following day a near-normal calm settled over the
streets, almost as if nothing had happened.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis started when students at Tehran University
demonstrated to protest a tough new press code and the closing of
Salam, a popular newspaper supportive of Iran's reformist
president, Mohammed Khatami. Islamic vigilantes and security forces
stormed a dormitory, beating students as they slept and pushing
some from windows.
</P>
<P>
   For six days students _ whose ranks were probably infiltrated by
their enemies _ took to the streets, but the demonstrations
deteriorated into rioting; security forces and street thugs used as
surrogates swept the demonstrators off the streets with tear gas
and truncheons. Huge crowds followed up with government-organized
counter-demonstrations. This time the students stayed home.
</P>
<P>
   And then, as if a cloak had been swept over the events, a new
quiet left it difficult to figure out who had won or lost or where
or when the next battle would take place.
</P>
<P>
   One way to look at these events is as the latest scenes in a
national epic drama. The students' frustrations with the strict
Islamic system have been building for years. But before last week,
they were mostly expressed in private, much as the conflict between
Khatami's followers and Islamic conservatives has developed behind
the scenes. Once the frustrations burst into public view, the
play-acting that infuses much of Iranian politics accelerated the
chain of events, with each side reaching for the most dramatic _
even overdrawn _ way to make its point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iranians are like wheat fields,'' one saying goes. ``When the
storm comes, they bend; when the storm passes, they stand up
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Another goes: ``Iranians are like water in a vase. If the vase
is a globe, they become a globe; if the vase is long-necked, they
become long-necked.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for example, how Iran deals with Hafez, its great
medieval lyrical poet. He wrote love poetry in which lines of the
Koran are interspersed with lines about red-lipped, big-breasted
women and the pleasures of drink. When young Iranians study Hafez
in school, they are told that the wine he discussed was not an
alcoholic drink that caused intoxication but a divine drink that
caused mystical rapture. Even Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the
stern father of Iran's revolution, wrote Hafez-like love poetry. No
one would dare say he wrote about real women and real drink.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden about-face, too, is a familiar part of Iranian
history. On Aug. 2, 1953, 2.5 million people heeded the call of
their nationalist prime minister, Mohammed Mossadegh, and voted to
dissolve a Parliament he called obstructionist.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen days later, tanks poured into the streets in a coup
d'etat financed by the Central Intelligence Agency that ousted
Mossadegh and restored the monarchy.
</P>
<P>
   That day, his supporters stayed home.
</P>
<P>
   Often what is happening can be tolerated; the exposure of what
is happening cannot. ``Talk is more important than reality,'' said
one political analyst who, until the events of last week, was
accustomed to speaking outside the shelter of anonymity. ``Everyone
knows that dogs pee in graveyards. But one of the worst things you
can say to someone is, `A dog peed on your father's grave.'''

<P>
   You would think the critical drubbing of ``Wild, Wild West''
this month _ on the heels of critical drubbings of ``The Mod
Squad,'' ``My Favorite Martian,'' ``The Avengers'' and ``Lost in
Space'' _ might give the slightest bit of pause to the original
thinkers bent on recycling defunct TV shows for the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   But no. Currently in varying stages of discussion, development
or production are motion pictures based on ``Get Smart,'' ``Hogan's
Heroes,'' ``Charlie's Angels,'' ``The Six Million Dollar Man,''
``Battlestar Galactica,'' ``Family Affair'' and ``Rocky and
Bullwinkle.'' Not to mention sequels to ``Mission: Impossible'' and
``The Flintstones.'' Live-action versions of the animated cartoons
``Inspector Gadget'' and ``Dudley Do-Right'' are about to be
released.
</P>
<P>
   These days, it's no longer a question of which TV shows, no
matter how crummy, become movies. The question now is which ones
don't. And the answer, increasingly, is precious few.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard a year ago that virtually every '60s series of note
had been optioned,'' said Steven Rubin, a producer who has had an
option on ``Combat'' for years. ``A day did not go by before you
heard that a series was being revived.''
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed from the days when there was genuine popular
demand for cinematic updates of cult shows like ``Star Trek.''
Today, name recognition rules. An established concept, however
mediocre, often sells better than an unknown one _ and not just in
Hollywood. Hence Broadway musicals like ``Footloose'' and the
forthcoming ``Saturday Night Fever,'' and TV shows like
``M-A-S-H,'' all based on films.
</P>
<P>
   ``The term that comes up often in this arena is
`pre-marketability,''' said Rubin. ``Given the opportunity,
companies would prefer to bring in a property that has familiarity
to it.''
</P>
<P>
   It can make pitching a movie a snap. The producer David Permut,
who helped develop the film version of ``The Beverly Hillbillies''
and is hatching new incarnations of ``Green Acres'' and ``The Love
Boat,'' remembered how he sold ``Dragnet'' (1987) to Universal:
``It was the shortest pitch in history. I walked in and said, `Dum
da dum-dum.' They said, `Let's make a movie.'''
</P>
<P>
   Some are mystified at the ease with which old TV shows get the
green light, given the fact that the younger viewers critical to
box-office success have probably never seen the originals. ``What
baffles me is movies like `McHale's Navy,' `Sergeant Bilko' or `Car
54, Where Are You?''' said Lee Goldberg, executive producer of the
series ``Martial Law'' and author of ``Television Series Revivals:
Sequels or Remakes of Canceled Shows'' (McFarland, 1993). ``The
target audience is in their 20s or 30s, yet they weren't even alive
when the series was on.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, enough poor remakes have done well enough at the box
office that the TV-to-multiplex nexus remains viable. ``Dragnet''
was one of 1987's top 10 box-office draws. ``Wild, Wild West'' was
the No. 1 film in the nation over the July 4 weekend. (True, it was
pretty hot that weekend.) Mark Schwed, a columnist for TV Guide,
said, ``When `Wild, Wild West' makes $36 million on opening
weekend, that makes people say, `What other damn shows can we
do?'''
</P>
<P>
   So don't expect the TV dust-offs to abate anytime soon. But is
there no show that Hollywood won't consider recycling? Permut has
been approached to do remakes of such titles as ``My Three Sons,''
``Hazel,'' ``My Little Margie'' and ``Sky King.'' He has passed on
all of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think every television franchise lends itself to big
screen treatment,'' he said. For his new ``Love Boat,'' Permut has
taken his cue from ``The Brady Bunch Movie'' and ``A Very Brady
Sequel,'' which won praise for their self-mocking spoofiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to take an innocent show and put a certain twisted
'90s take on it,'' he said. ``When I mention `Love Boat' to people,
they roll their eyes and say, `Oh, God _ They're doing that?' But
that plays into what I have in mind for it. It has to wink at the
audience. I have the trailer in my mind _ using footage from
`Titanic' and saying, `If you loved the last boat, you'll love the
next one.'''
</P>
<P>
   Permut also mused about getting Barry White to sing the show's
well-worn theme song and casting the rapper Snoop Dog as Isaac the
bartender. For ``Green Acres,'' he said, ``all the people of
Hooterville are devil worshippers in our version.''
</P>
<P>
   With a satirical approach, maybe nothing's out of the question.
Maybe ``My Mother the Car'' could star an exploding Pinto. Or ``
Ed'' could become a glue factory mogul. For Robert Justman, a
producer of both the original ``Star Trek'' and ``Star Trek: The
Next Generation,'' the formula's simple: ``A lot of bad taste and a
small helping of desperation.''

MEANWHILE, BACK IN BOSNIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review)

 By DAVID ROHDE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   SREBRENICA, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ After years of recalcitrance,
the Serbs finally capitulated here last month. Local Serb
nationalists allowed the majority Muslim town council _ elected in
absentia more than two years ago _ to take official control of a
town that has stood as a symbol of Serb defiance and brutality in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago this month, Bosnian Serb soldiers hunted down and
killed as many as 7,000 mostly unarmed Muslim men in the rugged
hills surrounding Srebrenica, a town the United Nations declared a
``safe area'' and vowed to protect. Since the war ended in 1995,
local Serb nationalists have used tactics ranging from endless
negotiations to rock-throwing mobs to prevent the town council from
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But in a scene hard to imagine only a few months ago, two dozen
Muslim politicians calmly sat down with 20 of their Serb
counterparts in the lobby of a local hotel on June 29 for the
inaugural session of the town council of the ``new Srebrenica.''
</P>
<P>
   Nesib Mandzic, a Bosnian Muslim high school principal who
unsuccessfully begged the Bosnian Serb army commander, Gen. Ratko
Mladic, to spare the lives of thousands of Muslims four years ago,
presided over the meetings as nothing less than Srebrenica's new
Muslim mayor.
</P>
<P>
   For the last month, Mandzic and other Muslim town councilors
have lived in the hotel under the protection of U.S. soldiers. This
summer they should be the first Muslims to move back to Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
   Bent Jensen, a former Danish policeman who is the international
community's special representative to Srebrenica, said the
explanation for the Serb change of heart was simple. ``There are no
jobs,'' he said. ``People are having trouble feeding themselves.
They are on their knees.''
</P>
<P>
   For four years, the Clinton administration has used its veto in
the World Bank and other aid institutions to enforce what critics
call a heavy-handed blockade of most relief to Srebrenica because
of Serb recalcitrance. While Muslim and Croat leaders also thwart
some efforts by members of other ethnic groups to return to their
homes, Serb leaders in Srebrenica and other nearby towns are viewed
as the most obstinate in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the blockade, the 12,000 Serbs who now inhabit
Srebrenica _ most of them refugees from Sarajevo _ have spent four
years living in the crumbling ruins of a town with 80 to 90 percent
unemployment, no potable running water and a wretched sewage
system. The NATO bombing that destroyed the Serbian economy this
spring may have been the final blow. Many of the Serbs who had jobs
actually worked in nearby towns in Serbia, Jensen said. They are
now unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   The denial of aid and the NATO bombing may be having similar
effects in other hard-line towns in eastern Bosnia. Andy Bearpark,
the head of the international resettlement task force here, said
Serbs in towns known for defiance are taking initial steps to allow
some Muslims to return to their homes in exchange for Western aid.
``There is still a long way to go,'' he cautioned.

   SREBRENICA, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ After years of recalcitrance,
the Serbs finally capitulated here last month. Local Serb
nationalists allowed the majority Muslim town council _ elected in
absentia more than two years ago _ to take official control of a
town that has stood as a symbol of Serb defiance and brutality in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago this month, Bosnian Serb soldiers hunted down and
killed as many as 7,000 mostly unarmed Muslim men in the rugged
hills surrounding Srebrenica, a town the United Nations declared a
``safe area'' and vowed to protect. Since the war ended in 1995,
local Serb nationalists have used tactics ranging from endless
negotiations to rock-throwing mobs to prevent the town council from
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But in a scene hard to imagine only a few months ago, two dozen
Muslim politicians calmly sat down with 20 of their Serb
counterparts in the lobby of a local hotel on June 29 for the
inaugural session of the town council of the ``new Srebrenica.''
</P>
<P>
   Nesib Mandzic, a Bosnian Muslim high school principal who
unsuccessfully begged the Bosnian Serb army commander, Gen. Ratko
Mladic, to spare the lives of thousands of Muslims four years ago,
presided over the meetings as nothing less than Srebrenica's new
Muslim mayor.
</P>
<P>
   For the last month, Mandzic and other Muslim town councilors
have lived in the hotel under the protection of U.S. soldiers. This
summer they should be the first Muslims to move back to Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
   Bent Jensen, a former Danish policeman who is the international
community's special representative to Srebrenica, said the
explanation for the Serb change of heart was simple. ``There are no
jobs,'' he said. ``People are having trouble feeding themselves.
They are on their knees.''
</P>
<P>
   For four years, the Clinton administration has used its veto in
the World Bank and other aid institutions to enforce what critics
call a heavy-handed blockade of most relief to Srebrenica because
of Serb recalcitrance. While Muslim and Croat leaders also thwart
some efforts by members of other ethnic groups to return to their
homes, Serb leaders in Srebrenica and other nearby towns are viewed
as the most obstinate in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the blockade, the 12,000 Serbs who now inhabit
Srebrenica _ most of them refugees from Sarajevo _ have spent four
years living in the crumbling ruins of a town with 80 to 90 percent
unemployment, no potable running water and a wretched sewage
system. The NATO bombing that destroyed the Serbian economy this
spring may have been the final blow. Many of the Serbs who had jobs
actually worked in nearby towns in Serbia, Jensen said. They are
now unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   The denial of aid and the NATO bombing may be having similar
effects in other hard-line towns in eastern Bosnia. Andy Bearpark,
the head of the international resettlement task force here, said
Serbs in towns known for defiance are taking initial steps to allow
some Muslims to return to their homes in exchange for Western aid.
``There is still a long way to go,'' he cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   Some Western diplomats cite the signs of initial success here as
proof that the same policy should be used in Serbia. The Clinton
administration is vowing to block most international aid to Serbia
until President Slobodan Milosevic is forced from power. But
skeptics have predicted that this policy would merely punish
ordinary Serbs.

   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Embassy in Madagascar, a coffee-growing
island nation hundreds of miles off the east coast of Africa, might
not seem a likely target for terrorists from the faraway Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
   But the State Department and the Central Intelligence Agency are
worried that followers of Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born terrorist
suspect, have had the U.S. compound under surveillance in
preparation for an attack this summer. As a result, the embassy has
been shuttered for most of the last month.
</P>
<P>
   The closing of U.S. embassies, those flag-flying symbols of U.S.
power and influence, was once about as common as a snowstorm on the
palm-shaded beaches of Madagascar.
</P>
<P>
   But in the year since terrorist bombs destroyed U.S. embassies
in Kenya and Tanzania and killed 224 people, 67 U.S. embassies and
consulates have been closed for some period of time for security
reasons. In June alone, six U.S. embassies in Africa were shut down
because of terrorist threats.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has no comparable figure for the prior
12-month period. But it says the number of closings in the year
since the August explosions in East Africa, which the United States
has blamed on bin Laden, dwarfs that for the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some of the swagger around here has disappeared,''
said a senior department official who has served at large embassies
in Europe and Asia. ``Once you treated the threat of terrorism as
the price of being a diplomat. You didn't demand resources for
embassy security. Now you do.''
</P>
<P>
   The embassy closings reflect both a heightened awareness of
security _ diplomats say they are much more likely to report
suspicious people loitering near an embassy _ and intelligence
reports suggesting that bin Laden's followers are about to strike
again.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials say the bombings in East Africa left
some U.S. ambassadors frantic about the vulnerability of their
embassies, and a number have flooded the department with requests
for better security or new buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Many U.S. diplomats were startled to learn after the embassy
bombing in Nairobi, Kenya, that the U.S. ambassador there, Prudence
Bushnell, had been pleading to the State Department for months for
money to build a safer compound; her requests had been turned down
for lack of money.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey by the department found that 80 percent of U.S.
embassies and other diplomatic offices did not meet security
standards set in the 1980s requiring that the buildings be at least
100 feet away from the street to protect against car bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say that panic is the word, but there's a
tremendous amount of concern,'' said another senior department
official. ``We know these 2,000-pound truck bombs are a new,
ominous threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats, angered by bureaucratic delay in Washington,
have sought help from private security companies in the aftermath
of the Africa bombings. Bechtel, the giant San Francisco-based
construction company, says it has spoken with diplomats in Croatia
about improving security at the highly exposed U.S. embassy in
Zagreb, the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Terrorism is also taken seriously at the State Department's
headquarters in Washington, which has recently been ringed with
concrete barricades like those that surround the White House. The
department is considering closing the airy, glass-enclosed main
entrance, fearing it may present a tempting target.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking to improve embassy security, the department's biggest
problem is, as always, money.
</P>
<P>
   The department received an emergency $1.4 billion from Congress
last fall to beef up embassy security, and the money has been used
for enhancements like alarms, closed-circuit television systems and
metal detectors, as well as for an extra 4,000 local guards to work
along the perimeter of embassy compounds.
</P>
<P>
   But virtually every security consultant who has studied the
problem for the government agrees that U.S. diplomats will remain
in danger until scores of old, vulnerable embassies are replaced
with new buildings, a project that will cost billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many embassy buildings that can't be secured,'' said
Jane C. Loeffler, author of ``The Architecture of Diplomacy''
(Princeton Architectural Press, 1998). ``Some are right on the
sidewalk. They have no setback, they're old, their walls aren't
strong enough.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, a State Department panel recommended a $14 billion
budget to improve embassy security over the next decade. But
Congress and the Office of Management and Budget have resisted a
commitment to anything approaching that amount because of budget
caps that the Clinton administration and Capitol Hill have vowed to
enforce.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials acknowledge that it will be years
before some of its most vulnerable diplomatic buildings are
replaced. Until then, Americans traveling abroad seeking help from
the local U.S. embassy had better get used to seeing a sign hanging
from a locked front gate: ``Closed.''

<P>
   After jurors announced a staggering verdict of $4.9 billion
against General Motors on July 9, a juror explained the panel's
fury at the company. ``We're just like numbers, I feel, to them,''
he said. ``Statistics.''
</P>
<P>
   Message sent: The jurors concluded that the automaker had risked
lives to save a few dollars on each car, and they were incensed.
Rejecting the automaker's claim that it had been careful, the jury
set $107.6 million as the sum to compensate six people for medical
and other expenses after they were severely burned when a fuel tank
exploded in a crash.
</P>
<P>
   The exclamation point came in the punitive damage award of $4.8
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Sending messages is the purpose of punitive damages, defined by
law as punishment for especially outrageous conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system awards punitive damages not out of concern for the
plaintiff but out of concern about the defendant's conduct,'' said
David W. Leebron, an expert on injury law who is the dean of the
Columbia Law School. ``It is to send a message both to the
defendant and others who might consider conduct like the
defendant's in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The award in the GM case is almost certain to be reduced by
appeals courts. But the case is the latest to highlight a ferocious
battle over whether punitive damages should be reined in, modified
or, perhaps, eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   The view that punitive damages give plaintiffs' lawyers a
windfall and provide little benefit was part of the Republican
rejection last week of a Democratic proposal to expand what are now
extremely limited rights of patients to sue managed health care
companies. Most patients can sue only for the value of the care
denied but cannot win punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, states are experimenting with new rules for
punitive damages. Judges and scholars are advancing new ideas about
how awards should be set. And some scholars and business lawyers
argue that the American legal system should join those of many
other countries, which do not allow civil juries to award punitive
damages at all.
</P>
<P>
   Under the banner of tort reform many state legislatures are
capping the amount of punitive damages people can recover.
Increasingly, state courts are striking down other new laws
limiting liability suits, saying they violate state constitutional
guarantees. But so far, challenges to punitive damages caps have
not met with great success.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more than any other legal device, punitive damages are
products of a view of the legal system as an economic tool. In a
free-market system, the thinking goes, the fear of financial losses
from private suits may work better than regulation ever could to
keep products safe.
</P>
<P>
   But as huge punitive damage awards have become Exhibit A for the
argument that the legal system is little more than a lottery,
critics have said the main contribution of punitive damages is to
inhibit business without making products safer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't design and build a product to the standards of a
future jury in California, because you don't know what those
standards are,'' said Steve Morrison, a lawyer in Columbia, S.C.,
and a former president of the Defense Research Institute, a
national organization of trial lawyers who defend corporations.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, where he has defended manufacturers, Morrison said,
litigation of civil cases is more rational because punitive damages
are viewed as penalties like criminal sanctions that should be
sought only by government.
</P>
<P>
   Some scholars say the big American verdicts, and the fear of
them, result in ``over-deterrence,'' or excessive caution to avoid
litigation that hampers the free market system. Decisions about
product safety like the proper location of automobile gas tanks,
they say, ought to be left to regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Industry lobbyists offer a list of products like new drugs that
do not get to American consumers because of executive's fears of
punitive damages. According to the American Tort Reform
Association, a group that lobbies for limitations on liability law,
the risk of punitive damages reduced the number of companies making
football helmets in the United States from 20 in the 1960s to two
by the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of punitive damages have their own list of products
that have been improved after juries hit their makers with big
punitive damage awards. According to Public Citizen, a consumer
advocacy group, punitive damages helped convince manufacturers to
change the design of tampons that had caused toxic shock syndrome
and forced makers of baby pajamas to produce them without flammable
fabrics.
</P>
<P>
   Some legal scholars argue that judges traditionally give jurors
too much leeway. ``Juries don't have any guidance about how much is
appropriate to punish,'' said Polly J. Price, a professor at Emory
University School of Law in Atlanta. That, some experts say, has
created punitive damage inflation, as incensed jurors pick bigger
and bigger numbers out of the air. And some say juries should be
given formulas that take into account such things as how much it
would have cost to make a dangerous product safer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its most expansive
decision on punitive damages in an Alabama case. The decision left
a great deal of room for interpretation and did not adopt a
formula. It did say courts reviewing punitive damage awards should
consider the ``degree of reprehensibility'' and the ratio between
punitive and compensatory damages.
</P>
<P>
   The justices said a punitive damage award of $2 million was
``grossly excessive'' when the compensatory damages were only
$4,000 in a consumer fraud case involving a new BMW that had been
painted to cover scratches. The court said the ratio of $500 in
punitive damages to each $1 of compensatory damages was too big,
but it did not specify an acceptable ratio.
</P>
<P>
   Some states have passed laws setting dollar limits, like
$250,000 in medical malpractice cases. In other states, legislators
have focused not so much on the amount of the awards as on the fact
that the money was going to plaintiffs and their lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   At least nine states, including Florida, Georgia and Kansas, are
experimenting with new laws that reduce the incentive to sue by
giving plaintiffs only a portion of any punitive damage award; 25
percent, for example, with the remainder going to the state.

</P>
<P>
   But as huge punitive damage awards have become Exhibit A for the
argument that the legal system is little more than a lottery,
critics have said the main contribution of punitive damages is to
inhibit business without making products safer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't design and build a product to the standards of a
future jury in California, because you don't know what those
standards are,'' said Steve Morrison, a lawyer in Columbia, S.C.,
and a former president of the Defense Research Institute, a
national organization of trial lawyers who defend corporations.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, where he has defended manufacturers, Morrison said,
litigation of civil cases is more rational because punitive damages
are viewed as penalties like criminal sanctions that should be
sought only by government.
</P>
<P>
   Some scholars say the big American verdicts, and the fear of
them, result in ``over-deterrence,'' or excessive caution to avoid
litigation that hampers the free market system. Decisions about
product safety like the proper location of automobile gas tanks,
they say, ought to be left to regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Industry lobbyists offer a list of products like new drugs that
do not get to American consumers because of executive's fears of
punitive damages. According to the American Tort Reform
Association, a group that lobbies for limitations on liability law,
the risk of punitive damages reduced the number of companies making
football helmets in the United States from 20 in the 1960s to two
by the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of punitive damages have their own list of products
that have been improved after juries hit their makers with big
punitive damage awards. According to Public Citizen, a consumer
advocacy group, punitive damages helped convince manufacturers to
change the design of tampons that had caused toxic shock syndrome
and forced makers of baby pajamas to produce them without flammable
fabrics.
</P>
<P>
   Some legal scholars argue that judges traditionally give jurors
too much leeway. ``Juries don't have any guidance about how much is
appropriate to punish,'' said Polly J. Price, a professor at Emory
University School of Law in Atlanta. That, some experts say, has
created punitive damage inflation, as incensed jurors pick bigger
and bigger numbers out of the air. And some say juries should be
given formulas that take into account such things as how much it
would have cost to make a dangerous product safer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its most expansive
decision on punitive damages in an Alabama case. The decision left
a great deal of room for interpretation and did not adopt a
formula. It did say courts reviewing punitive damage awards should
consider the ``degree of reprehensibility'' and the ratio between
punitive and compensatory damages.
</P>
<P>
   The justices said a punitive damage award of $2 million was
``grossly excessive'' when the compensatory damages were only
$4,000 in a consumer fraud case involving a new BMW that had been
painted to cover scratches. The court said the ratio of $500 in
punitive damages to each $1 of compensatory damages was too big,
but it did not specify an acceptable ratio.
</P>
<P>
   Some states have passed laws setting dollar limits, like
$250,000 in medical malpractice cases. In other states, legislators
have focused not so much on the amount of the awards as on the fact
that the money was going to plaintiffs and their lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   At least nine states, including Florida, Georgia and Kansas, are
experimenting with new laws that reduce the incentive to sue by
giving plaintiffs only a portion of any punitive damage award; 25
percent, for example, with the remainder going to the state.

BEYOND THE BLUSTER OVER HEALTH CARE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review)

 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN

<P>
   After listening to the rancorous debate in the Senate over
health care reform last week, it would seem obvious that
differences between Democrats and Republicans are profound. The
Democrats wanted to give powerful new federal rights to patients in
managed-care plans. The Republicans countered with narrower
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The debate consisted largely of name-calling. Vice President Al
Gore labeled the Republican plan a ``charade'' and Sen. Tom
Daschle, the minority leader, called it a fraud. Among the
Republicans, Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas accused the Democrats of
deciding for political reasons ``to destroy HMOs.''
</P>
<P>
   But the partisanship obscures an important truth: The
substantive differences are narrower than they seem. Removed from
the context of election-year politics, combatants on both sides
concede they could find ways to give Americans protection from
health-care plans that wrongly skimp on coverage. ``These issues
are eminently susceptible to compromise,'' said Ronald F. Pollack,
director of Families USA, a consumer advocacy group. ``It is a
tragedy that this became a partisan dispute.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats jousted with Republicans over rival legislation
for a so-called patients' bill of rights. The Democrats' version
would have given patients new rights to appeal a health plan's
refusal to pay for tests or procedures, to sue health plans and to
choose specialists in certain cases. On Thursday Senate Republicans
passed a bill imposing less government regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans know their bill will never get past President
Clinton's veto pen. Many supporters of the Democrats' bill
acknowledge privately that it overreaches and, besides, cannot
pass. Never mind. Obstinacy serves a political purpose. Next year,
Republicans will go fishing for campaign contributions from HMOs
and Democrats will do the same from trial lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats point to four critical disputes that
health care experts and lobbyists for both parties say privately
could be resolved through compromise.
</P>
<P>
   External Appeal _ Doctors and patients hate it when health plans
deny coverage for treatments that physicians deem medically
appropriate. Both parties' plans would address the problem by
giving patients the right to appeal to independent medical experts
from a list approved by state or federal authorities. These experts
would determine if a proposed treatment is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republicans would allow health plans to choose the
experts who review their cases. Democrats say that would encourage
reviewers to attract future business by siding with insurers. A
possible solution, according to some lobbyists, would be for the
Republicans to accept a system that would assign qualified
reviewers randomly to individual cases. That might prove more
complicated administratively, but it would address the Democrats'
objections.
</P>
<P>
   MEDICAL NECESSITY: External review would determine whether
proposed treatments are medically necessary. But Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy of Massachusetts and other Democratic critics say the
Republican bill would allow insurance plans to impose a restrictive
definition of necessary treatment that would bind outside
reviewers. The threat is that plans would cover, to take an extreme
example, only those treatments necessary to save a patient's life.
Under that crimped definition, treatments that merely relieve
suffering would not qualify. Republicans say their plan would not
allow for such abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' proposal, by contrast, would give treating
physicians a nearly unfettered right to decide what tests and
treatment are necessary, as long as they fall within ``generally
accepted principles of professional medical practice.'' But that
broad category could cover huge amounts of needless, expensive and
inappropriate care that often poses an unnecessary risk of injury.
Many health experts say the provision would return the country to
fee-for-service coverage, where doctors could raise their income by
over-prescribing treatments, assured that insurance companies could
do little but go along.
</P>
<P>
   One compromise that Democrats might accept, analysts say, would
put in clear legislative language the right of external reviewers
to define medical necessity. Reviewers would weigh the need for
treatment based on a preponderance of scientific evidence about a
procedure's effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   LEGAL LIABILITY: Under current law, patients in
employer-sponsored plans have little legal recourse if they believe
they have been injured when their plan denies them reimbursement
for care. The Democrats want to give patients the right to sue
health plans and collect sizable awards in such cases. Republicans
say an unlimited right to file lawsuits would produce arbitrary
judgments that would drive up medical costs and insurance premiums.
The Republicans also say the Democratic plan would put employers at
legal risk and provide a windfall for trial lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   One possible solution, experts say, would allow only those
patients who first refer their disputes to external review panels
to file suit against their health plans. Few lawyers would waste
their time taking a dispute to court after a review ruled against
their client. And few health plans would risk legal liability by
denying treatment that an external review deemed necessary. Sen.
John Chafee, R-R.I., proposed establishing guidelines for financial
damages, which could eliminate the lottery-like nature of many jury
awards.
</P>
<P>
   SCOPE OF COVERAGE: The Democrats want federal protections
extended to about 160 million patients in employer-covered health
plans, even those already under state regulation. The Republicans
say federal law is needed to protect only about 50 million patients
in large employer-sponsored plans that federal law exempts from
state regulation. Lobbyists maintain that if the two sides could
resolve the issues of external review, medical necessity and legal
liability, the Republicans might concede on the scope of coverage.

   Whether it rains or freezes, and even if you don't have a
plastic Jesus on the dashboard of your car, you might have a hard
time avoiding reminders of God on highways across the country this
summer. Since last fall, billboards and signs bearing the messages
here have appeared on roads in some 40 states from Alaska to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   They were originally commissioned by a Florida resident,
insisting on anonymity, who paid the Smith Agency in Fort
Lauderdale $150,000 to produce a spiritual but non-denominational
ad campaign ``that people could relate to in a '90s kind of way,''
said the agency's president, Andrew Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The result was arch one-liners purportedly from God but
conceived by a very mortal Smith ad executive, Charlie Robb.
</P>
<P>
   After the billboards appeared last fall in Broward County in
Florida, the Washington-based Outdoor Advertising Association of
America took notice, and took the campaign nationwide. It persuaded
many of its more than 800 members, billboard companies and the
like, to display the messages as a public service.
</P>
<P>
   So far, they've appeared in 10,000 places _ a commitment of $15
million in ad space and production costs, the association says.
Last month the ads won the Smith Agency an Obie, outdoor
advertising's Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   Robb said that after working on campaigns for mundane products
like beer, becoming God's adman was ``bizarre.'' But he added,
``There is no downside to what we're selling here.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone's ecstatic. Some say the ads are too flippant and
slick a way of promoting God. And, in a bow to non-Christians, a
message with a reference to Sunday (immediately following) was
dropped when the campaign went national.

THE PROBLEM WITH GETTING TOUGH WHEN AN ACCIDENT IS A CRIME 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(jt) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pleas for justice are routine after an airplane
crash, and they are generally played out in civil courts, where
survivors and relatives of victims sue for damages. But last week,
in a surprising move, prosecutors won criminal indictments against
a maintenance company, two mechanics and a superior in the crash of
a Valujet plane in the Everglades in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   If the indictments were meant to be a warning to be more
diligent, some in the the aviation industry say they could have the
opposite effect. Fear of criminal investigation, they say, could
prompt airline employees and others to be uncooperative in
investigations into the causes of crashes.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board's report on the Valujet
crash, issued in 1997, came after an extensive investigation that
relied in part on the participation of Sabretech, the maintenance
company, and Valujet. The worst the companies had to fear, or so
they thought, was a fine. But if jail time becomes a serious
possibility, companies may be less forthcoming in the future.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, say the experts, seeking justice may actually
make it harder to get at the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this country, it's unprecedented to try to mete out
criminal punishment for an aviation accident,'' said Kenneth Quinn,
the lawyer for Sabretech and a former general counsel of the
Federal Aviation Administration. ``What we properly tried to do is
figure out what went wrong and why, and to prevent a recurrence,
and that is as it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   In its report, the safety board concluded that Valujet had not
properly supervised Sabretech, which had improperly labeled and
packaged dangerous aircraft parts called oxygen generators.
Sabretech then delivered the packages to Valujet for shipment on a
flight from Miami to Atlanta. The plane caught fire shortly after
takeoff and crashed, killing all 110 people aboard. The criminal
charges filed last week echoed the safety board's findings.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of prosecution has conflicted with safety considerations
before.
</P>
<P>
   After a plane crash in New Zealand in 1995 in which four people
died, the police, hoping to gather evidence against the crew, went
to court and were granted access to the cockpit voice recorder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's had the pilot community inflamed,'' said Stuart Matthews,
the chairman and president of the Flight Safety Foundation, an
international organization based in Alexandria, Va. ``We have been
very concerned about it. We strongly support the idea of
nonpunitive reporting.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, prosecutors conducted an investigation of
the crash of a twin-engine plane that fell apart in flight near
Eagle Lake, Texas, in 1990. Maintenance workers had taken apart the
tail and left out several screws when they put it back together.
Ultimately, no charges were filed.
</P>
<P>
   And after the captain and first officer of USAir flight 5050
could not be located by the FAA in the hours after their plane ran
off the end of a runway at LaGuardia Airport in 1989, Queens
prosecutors considered bringing charges. The pilots reported in the
following day, and no charges were filed.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of prosecution has stymied a program in the United States
to study routine, uneventful flights for clues to future problems.
Several European airlines routinely download huge amounts of flight
computer data from their airplanes for screening in the hopes of
spotting potential trouble.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Scandinavian Airline Systems determined in the
early 1990s that 40 percent of its pilots were flying the airline's
newly purchased turbo-prop planes faster than the maximum
recommended speed. The pilots were accustomed to jets, it turned
out, and were sent for retraining, solving the problem. If the data
had not been studied, the problem might have gone undetected until
it contributed to an accident.
</P>
<P>
   But that system has been slow to catch on here because pilots
and airlines worry that the aviation administration might use the
data to spot rule violations, and seek civil penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are going to find something the crew is doing wrong,
and they are going to penalize the crew for doing it,'' Matthews
said, ``very soon you're going to have a situation where crews are
not going to be willing to have a flight data recorder on board.
It's a lot better to identify the problems and save that accident,
and save a lot of lives, than to shoot the messenger who had an
inadvertent mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   But others point out that some mistakes are intentional, or at
least grossly careless. In the Valujet case, Sabretech faces state
charges of murder and manslaughter, and a vice president and two
mechanics face federal charges of carelessly handling deadly
materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``This crash was completely preventable,'' said Katherine
Fernandez Rundle, the Miami-Dade County prosecutor handling the
case. ``This was not an accident; it was a crime. It was a
homicide.''

THE PROBLEM WITH GETTING TOUGH WHEN AN ACCIDENT IS A CRIME 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(jt) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

   WASHINGTON _ Pleas for justice are routine after an airplane
crash, and they are generally played out in civil courts, where
survivors and relatives of victims sue for damages. But last week,
in a surprising move, prosecutors won criminal indictments against
a maintenance company, two mechanics and a superior in the crash of
a Valujet plane in the Everglades in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   If the indictments were meant to be a warning to be more
diligent, some in the the aviation industry say they could have the
opposite effect. Fear of criminal investigation, they say, could
prompt airline employees and others to be uncooperative in
investigations into the causes of crashes.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board's report on the Valujet
crash, issued in 1997, came after an extensive investigation that
relied in part on the participation of Sabretech, the maintenance
company, and Valujet. The worst the companies had to fear, or so
they thought, was a fine. But if jail time becomes a serious
possibility, companies may be less forthcoming in the future.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, say the experts, seeking justice may actually
make it harder to get at the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this country, it's unprecedented to try to mete out
criminal punishment for an aviation accident,'' said Kenneth Quinn,
the lawyer for Sabretech and a former general counsel of the
Federal Aviation Administration. ``What we properly tried to do is
figure out what went wrong and why, and to prevent a recurrence,
and that is as it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   In its report, the safety board concluded that Valujet had not
properly supervised Sabretech, which had improperly labeled and
packaged dangerous aircraft parts called oxygen generators.
Sabretech then delivered the packages to Valujet for shipment on a
flight from Miami to Atlanta. The plane caught fire shortly after
takeoff and crashed, killing all 110 people aboard. The criminal
charges filed last week echoed the safety board's findings.

   John Kennedy, Jr., was famous even before he left the womb, and
his 38 years in the media glare as the son of one of this country's
most legendary politicians has informed his ideas about how
politics and its players should be covered by his magazine.
</P>
<P>
   On January 8, Kennedy sat down for an interview with editor in
chief Steven Brill and senior writer Abigail Pogrebin at the New
York headquarters of Hachette Filipacchi Magazines. Kennedy
explained why George fills a gap in political journalism and where
he thinks it has strayed. He didn't duck questions about how
personal his involvement is in the magazine, how he weathers the
carping of critics who say George is irrelevant, and why he thinks,
after three-plus years, he's proving them wrong. Edited excerpts of
the approximately 70-minute interview follow.
</P>
<P>
   STEVEN BRILL: What are you trying to do with the magazine?
</P>
<P>
   JOHN KENNEDY, Jr.: When we started, there (had) never really
been a political magazine for the general public in America that
(had) been commercially successful. So, basically, the idea was to
create a lifestyle magazine that was grounded in politics and
American history for a broad audience, particularly with reference
to people who hadn't really been drawn to political magazines
before -- women and young people.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: But what's a political lifestyle magazine?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: The idea was to make it accessible, and to make it
visual, and to make it entertaining -- as opposed to something you
had to read in order to be literate in your job and conversant in
the environment that you work (in). Which I think the National
Journals or the National Reviews or The New Republics are, for the
most part. And that it has the visual cues of a lifestyle magazine
-- that it be visually driven, that there be photographs, that
there be color, that there be a sense of vibrancy and a kind of
contemporary modern look, that are evocative of a fashion magazine
or an Entertainment Weekly.
</P>
<P>
   Fundamentally, one of the big problems with political magazines
before (was) that they really had not changed the way that they
looked in 40 years. They're text driven, they're black-and-white,
they're written mostly by men, mostly for men. And they don't
reflect a modern sensibility, which is to try to grab people's
attention and say, This is interesting. Politics is interesting.
You should know about it. Come read our magazine.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: So I read George this month, and I'm a 27-year-old middle
manager at Microsoft. Your perfect (reader), right? I read George
this month, and what do I know that I didn't know (before)?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: That's a difficult question. There might be certain
facts that are in the magazine that you didn't know. But the thing
that we really wanted to do was, for any well-rounded person,
politics is something one should be literate about, and people want
to be. Our idea was to make politics accessible to people who
wanted to have it close by, who wanted to read it and pick it up,
who could talk about politics with the same sort of informed
casualness that they might talk about the new movie coming out, or
a new record, or the NBA strike, or whatever. And the way that we
figured is the best way to do that is really through the people
that inhabit the political process, and to deal with them as
compelling personalities.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Give me an example of an article -- particularly in
recent issues -- that you think really is emblematic of the
mission.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I think that there are two main kinds of articles
(that) do that for us. One is a piece which has not appeared yet
(on Minnesota Democratic Senator) Paul Wellstone. (He) is not a
terribly well-known senator, but yet (was) probably going to run
for president. (He) is known as this kind of quirky eccentric
within the Senate, very liberal. And not much has been reported on
him. And he's had a fascinating life. He came from a very
interesting background, quite passionate, quite aggressive, and
feisty. He was a boxer, and that informs all his sensibilities. And
you read about him, and all of a sudden, instead of just a guy you
see who's in the Senate, you have a sense that you have a proximity
to him as a person, to his lifestyle, to his upbringing -- that you
didn't have before -- that I think only a magazine can do (and) TV
can't. Conversely, when you have familiar people who have a proven
ability to get the attention of the masses -- like a John Travolta
-- talking about politics, talking about what he thinks about it, I
think people are interested in that. Maybe not the Washington
cognoscenti, but I think that it's interesting for the kind of
people who we're going for to have that exchange. To hear
politicians talk about popular culture, (such as Ohio Republican
Congressman) John Kasich talking about his first Grateful Dead
concert, which (was) in an article that we had before, or Tony
Blankley (Newt Gingrich's former press secretary) on what it was
like to be a conservative who smoked marijuana in a university in
the late sixties.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: You just mentioned the difference between the cognoscenti
and everybody else. There seems to be a gap, in terms of the
perception of this magazine. Washington insiders say this magazine
does not have the inside story; there's no buzz about it on Capitol
Hill. But when we talk to the people who subscribe to it, they like
it. Does that bother you that there's that gap? Is that gap
bridgeable?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: We didn't want to be the National Journal. We've had
one politician on our cover, Newt Gingrich, and we've had an old
photograph of Richard Nixon. And when you have in your inaugural
issue Madonna talking about, ``If I were President,'' clearly it
had not been our objective to woo the folks in Washington. They
have The Hotline, they have C-SPAN, they have The (Weekly)
Standard, they have The New Republic. They have their own
discourse, their own conversations.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Do you care if they dismiss it?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Sure. No one likes to have their hard work dismissed.
But I don't lose sleep over that. (We) are the largest political
magazine in the country now, which is, after three years, an
achievement. We have the numbers, and we have the audience that we
wanted to get. And if the two shall meet, great -- and I think,
occasionally, that they do. I also think George is a little bit of
a closet read. There's a sense of George, particularly (for)
younger staffers, younger people on the Hill, (being) a paradigm of
politics that they understand. And if they don't read it to get the
latest on the budget debate, that's fine. But if they read it
because it's (got) an interesting article on Wellstone, or someone
got an interesting thing on (Arizona Republican Senator) John
McCain, and there's some great photographs that have never been
there before, then I think we've one our job.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: What do you think your biggest mistake has been,
editorially? What would you take back?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: (Pause) I think the magazine is more explicitly
political now. We maybe shoehorned, forced, the popular-culture
stuff in.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: What's an example?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I don't want to name names. Well, why not? Demi Moore
was doing, I think it was Striptease, right? That was going to be a
big movie. She has an affair in the movie with a senator, I think,
or something like that, so there was, tangentially, a political
aspect to it. And so we had her on the cover talking about sexual
politics. And that's not what people really want to hear about from
her. You can't just take any movie, and you can't just take any
person, 'cause people smell when you're trying to give them a bait
and switch. So now we confine ourselves to what movies are dealing
with a political topic, sort of a compelling social issue. For
instance, A Civil Action. There were other, more glamorous folks we
could have put on the cover, but they weren't going to be about a
political movie. And we sort of made the choice: We're going to
confine ourselves to these things. And we're not just going to put
someone in a string bikini on the cover.
</P>
<P>
   ABIGAIL POGREBIN: But when you say it's more explicitly
political now, do you mean it also has more politics?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Yeah. Because what we've found from researching was
that people like the proximity of the popular-culture aspects to
it. They got it. A lot of our reader mail is people who said, I
never thought I would like a political magazine before. I never
bought one. I'm really starting to understand it. I appreciate the
nonbiased aspect of it. But they don't want too much pop-culture
stuff in there. Just like in Rolling Stone, they don't want too
much politics. They want mostly music and a little bit of politics.
In our magazine they want mostly politics and a little bit of
popular culture. And when the balance gets out of whack, I think it
(becomes) a problem. Which is good for me, because actually I know
more about the political world than I do about the entertainment
world.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Tell me about your own involvement in the editorial
process. If I look through a table of contents, how many of the
stories in there -- big or little -- would be your ideas? KENNEDY:
It depends. Some issues more than others.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: In the current issue you've got (former) President Reagan
on the cover. Is that something where you said, Let's do that?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: What really happens is, we have meetings with the
senior staff, and there are things that interest me, and there are
things that interest them, and we talk about them. And, in a kind
of Socratic method, we vet the ideas. And the ones that stand up
under that scrutiny, and the ones (for) which we have a writer that
can deliver it, get done in the magazine. There was always, from
the beginning of this magazine, a certain skepticism of me. Was I
(the) front man for this?
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: That's why I'm asking.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Frankly, I'm not sure I want to dignify it with an
answer.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: That's why I didn't ask it directly.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: (Laughs) This enterprise has consumed almost now six
years of my life. It came at considerable, personal kind of risk.
There (were) a lot of people that would have loved to see this be a
farce, and it hasn't been. And I don't really care what people
think as far as my involvement. I care what the people who work
here think. And it works, and our readers seem to (think) we put
out a good product. So I'm as involved as (an) editor in chief
should be.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Do you read everything that's in the magazine?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Do I read every word? Mmm, no. I'll skim stories, and
I'll get very involved in some stories that I think are important,
and really line-edit (them). And other ones -- for instance, the
columnists -- I don't get as involved in, because they work with
separate editors.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: What about on the business side?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Well, I'm an owner, and not many editor in chiefs are
owners. And I think that since part of the mission of the magazine
is the challenge of Could you really marry the commercial
opportunities that magazines really need to live by and politics?,
(then) it's appropriate that I be the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: You sound defensive.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Oh, I'm not defensive. But I think it's quite important
that I proselytize, that I make the case for George.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: And that includes making the case to advertisers?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Oh, yeah. Absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: One ingredient it seems you've avoided is (what) I'll
call ``Your Tax Dollars at Work'' -- or anything about how the
government really works. Why doesn't a magazine about politics have
that kind of thing in the mix?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Well, I'm not sure I really agree that there isn't a
process aspect to the magazine because, actually, I think there is.
And particularly in the front of the book there is more (of that)
kind of the arcana of government and politics. The government-waste
thing is an old faithful, everyone does it. We do these top tens
every now and then that are sort of government excesses, or bad
laws, or failed bills, or what the do-nothing Congress didn't do.
But we don't want to fall back in a reflexive, antigovernment,
the-government-is-fleecing-you, politicians-are-fleecing-you
position. There's enough of that and we would rather sort of focus
on the things that are exclusive to us.
</P>
<P>
   POGREBIN: What about investigative pieces? Do you feel that's
something you want more of?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Yeah, I would love more. I mean, as you probably have
found, we did one on Scientology in Germany. We've done a couple on
the drug industry. Investigative pieces are difficult. We tried to
do one on the Apollo Theater (in New York); it didn't pan out. And
I find that investigative reporters are a really unique batch. And
that for every eight or ten that you assign, maybe you get two that
really work and really deliver the goods. BRILL: I always tell
people that if I were running a journalism school, I would get rid
of the whole curriculum. And the only thing that would happen is
that the students would be written about. The best training for any
journalist is to have someone write a profile on you, and have it
published in your hometown newspaper. Then you understand
everything about journalism. If I'm right, that makes you the best
qualified journalist on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: (Laughs) Right.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: How do you think your life makes you -- or doesn't make
you -- a more sensitive journalist, or (does it just make) you want
to be more vengeful?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I think, to be honest, it's an advantage and a
disadvantage. I have a perspective on politics that I would say is
unique, and one (that) I created a magazine around. There's been
enough written about my family that I have notions about
journalism, when it's practiced well and when it's not. However, I
think good journalism has a very strong point of view, and
downplays facts which go against you and plays up facts which
support you.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: A good piece should downplay facts that go against you?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Yeah, like in a good argument. Like a lawyer makes a
good argument. You are trying to persuade, and you craft an
argument accordingly. So I think that my own experience has made me
probably more sensitive to a fairness issue. And perhaps the pieces
have suffered, in that it's fun to read a really harsh, mean piece
about somebody.
</P>
<P>
   POGREBIN: What (does) it mean to you that something is
nonpartisan or postpartisan, words that you have used to describe
the magazine?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I think the current political imbroglio has indicated
that real people across America do not have the same investment in
partisan politics as people in Washington do. And I think that you
find people want solutions, people want government to work, they
want to feel good about politics. And they'll vote the person
rather than the issue a lot of the time. And I think that happens
increasingly. Part of the reason why I think the Washington
community maybe has not embraced George to the extent that readers
across America have (is that) there is a populist element to it. We
are interested in exploring the outsider sensibility about
politics. And that is kind of postpartisan -- or it's a lot more
nonpartisan than it is in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   POGREBIN: What I heard a lot from the (political and media)
elite was, if (George) had a point of view it would have more edge,
it would count more, it would matter more. But the readers said
they like it.They don't feel like anybody is coming down on one
side, and they're tired of that. But it does also feel like it's in
no-man's-land. Does that bother you?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: It is something which is the essential challenge of
this magazine. I think a lot of people expected there would be a
brief flurry of mouthing about (being) nonpartisan, and then it
would turn into John Kennedy's soapbox. And it can't be that. The
way you address that is, your stories have strong points of view,
and strong sensibilities, but that you have a variety of different
ones in there. The thing that people really respond to the most is
that they do feel that they are not being led around by the nose.
And in terms of Washington, we get a lot of access. Maybe they just
think that we'll just be nice to everybody. But I do think that
they think that there is an element of fairness, which, given my
own experience, is very important.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Suppose the magazine assigns a piece about somebody, and
that somebody doesn't want to pose for a photo. Would you assign a
photographer to ambush that person?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: It would never be necessary, because there's so much
pickup (photos available from agencies) of the people that we do. I
know what the question is -- would I assign a paparazzi? And it's
sort of a trite question, because you don't have to.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Let's see if I can make it a little less trite. Most of
the pickup you'd buy would be from those same paparazzi.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: No, not necessarily.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: But you wouldn't buy one of those shots, or you would?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: No, I would buy them. I would get the best pickup that
was available that I could.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Even if it's (a) photographer who ambushed someone?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I'm not a big moralizer about the paparazzi. I may not
like it, and it may be a difficult aspect of my life, but it's my
problem.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: You don't begrudge them doing the job they do?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: It's not something that I think is worth talking
(about). It's not a pressing public principle.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: If you were the editor of Salon, would you have reported
on the sex life of (Illinois Republican Congressman) Henry Hyde?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: We may not have done it, but was I dismayed that it
happened? No. Because I think that any time there is an element of
hypocrisy lingering, it's interesting to read about it.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: So you would or would not have done it?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I really don't know. For us to do it, it would have
looked weird. You know, it's inconsistent. There are obviously my
own family issues in which it looks hypocritical. It looks too
partisan. So would I have done it in our magazine? No. Salon is
obviously a magazine you know where they're coming from. They're
fighting that fight. So was it appropriate for them to do it? Yeah,
I think so. It's not as appropriate for us to do it.
</P>
<P>
   POGREBIN: When you sat down to do a Richard Mellon Scaife
interview, (a lot of reporters called it) a coup. Everybody wanted
(to talk to the millionaire well known for funding right-wing
publications and think tanks). And some people have said that you
have a kind of Larry King style of letting people's words speak for
themselves, but not necessarily nailing them to the wall. Is that
something that is conscious?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Well, I'm very flattered by the comparison. (Laughs) I
find interviews difficult, because I don't like to really do them,
present situation excluded, and I know, having done a few of them,
what makes me uncomfortable and what makes me feel noncooperative.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Which is what?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Which is sort of a sense that a reporter has an idea
already about what he wants this to come to. That you're not just
sitting down in a conversation and see(ing) where it will lead;
there's sort of a setup going on. And I just find the people I
interview are people whom I'm interested in. I worked in the Reagan
Justice Department during law school, I clerked for William
Bradford Reynolds in the civil-rights division. Not because I
agreed with him, but because I was just interested in how they
thought, which was obviously completely opposite to what I had
grown up with. So I just go in to an interview, and I just ask
questions that I am curious about. And, more often than not, it
starts out stilted, but, (as with) Richard Mellon Scaife, he just
felt comfortable, and he just talked. It's not my nature to be
inquisitorial; I think it is my nature to be curious. I'm thinking
about the people who read us. You're sort of being a proxy for
them.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Doesn't it drive you crazy to read the stuff that
belittles you and the magazine, when you're actually coming to work
every day?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Well, there's a lot less of it now than there was in
the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Did you ever think, Why did I get into this?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: No, because I knew that was going to happen. I knew
that it would irritate people no end -- the supreme irony of me
going and joining a media conglomerate to be a journalist! And then
to have it kind of work fairly well? I mean, we're still in
business, you know?
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: But you like to be liked
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I don't really like to be liked. I never look for
approval from the journalistic community. If it comes, great. But I
didn't really see that as the group that I had to answer to. And
then the more condescending it got, the more that I knew that I was
doing the right thing. But that has stopped now, I think. I mean,
we're like the Conan O'Brien of magazines. You know, we're still
here.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: In your column in the (February) issue, you (wrote)
something about how the idea of politicians as role models is a
fraud. That's what you think?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: No. I think that people don't think of politicians as
role models anymore, that there is an inherent contradiction. On
one side, we perpetuate the notion that politicians should be role
models, and on the other, we don't treat them as such.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Don't you think they can be, should be?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I think they are, merely by doing what they're doing.
And if they have a marital infidelity or if they did something in
college that they wouldn't do 20 years later, I don't think that
makes them a role model. But I think for an industry now that has
been (as) demarketed as politics, who wants to go into politics now
anymore? People just roll their eyes, and I think that's really
sad. When my father was president, there were 30 people covering
the White House. There are now 3,000, and they're all chasing the
same rabbit. So it becomes very difficult to maintain perfection
under that kind of scrutiny. You're putting an impossible burden on
them -- and you're setting yourself up for a sense of failure about
the political system. And I think that that burden is unfair, and
it makes good people stay away from government.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: I've got to ask you one snide, condescending question.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Sure.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Dustin Hoffman, Robert De Niro, John Travolta, Tom Hanks,
Christy Turlington, Johnny Depp. You're getting the point, right?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Mmm-hmm. BRILL: Bruce Willis, Charlize Theron, whoever
she is.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Hey, she's on the cover of Vanity Fair this month, and
we had her first.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Well, okay, fair enough. My point is, if you take the
last year of covers, with all of the movie stars, that package
doesn't say this is a magazine about politics. Are you doing with
the magazine what people get frustrated and angry at politicians
for, which is doing something that's popular, that brings in a
crowd, and then, after the election, changing the message on them?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I started this as a business, and my objective is that
this be a real business. Because if it's not a business then
there's no point in doing it. And I don't shy away from that.
Having familiar people from popular culture integrated within the
political content of our magazine, that is the essence of what the
magazine is, which is that politics has migrated into the realm of
popular culture. And in order to maintain the attention and the
interests of Americans, or viewers, they have to use the same kind
of attention-getting device as popular culture, that politicians
have to become personalities, in the show-business sense. And by
virtue of the fact that there's been an explosion of media,
personalities have an opportunity to become political. And that's
really the germ of what George magazine is saying. I think we've
made, perhaps, an error on one or two covers. I don't want to
offend her, but Charlize Theron I think was arguably one of those.
We were doing a thing about American folklore, and she was
commenting about America. It would really be unsatisfying to me to
have some somber politician on the cover, and we gather dust in the
back of some newsstand somewhere. I mean, if I sell 180,000 copies
of a political magazine -- man, I am happy. And so I could do
something else, with some drawing of (South Carolina Republican
Senator) Strom Thurmond and sell 20(,000), and maybe I'm serious
and consequential in Washington. But if the people that I'm trying
to reach are passing me by, then that's a failure.
</P>
<P>
   POGREBIN: What about Maureen Dowd's quote: ``Celebrity distorts
democracy, by giving the rich, beautiful and famous more authority
than they deserve?'' The idea that it's one thing to sell
magazines, but to give celebrities any sense of weight, (for
instance) what Pamela (Anderson) Lee has to say, is taking it a
step further than you should?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Maureen Dowd writes, as far as I can tell, mostly about
the personal, about celebrity, and about the personally trivial.
And it makes for interesting (reading). The reason why she's
interesting is because she writes about the most kind of
provocative personal points of people in politics. And so that
comment seems sort of freighted with contradiction coming from
where it does.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Should the media report about the sex lives of kids of
politicians?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: It depends how interesting their sex lives are.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: You really mean that?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I think it's a broad question. I think you should give
me a context.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Eleanor Mondale (the daughter of former vice-president
Walter Mondale and the subject of a gossipy February story that had
little connection to politics). That's the context.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Listen, I understand the irony in that story appearing
in George. But that's kind of a racy, fun story, and something that
I would read.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: And if she calls you up and says, ``How can you, of all
people, publish a story like that?''
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I'd say: ``Hey, man -- you know, I've been there. It's
a pain in the neck, but, you know, it ain't as bad as all that.''
</P>
<P>
   POGREBIN: Looking back on your famous editor's note (in which
Kennedy wrote about two of his cousins' marital problems and posed
tastefully nude for an accompanying picture), would you do anything
differently?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: That's almost one of (our) best-selling issues ever, so
I don't think so. Without reinterpreting the letter, because
hopefully the letter (spoke) for itself, though it was deliberately
oblique, I did that because that was something I wanted to say and
something that I had felt strongly about, which is, we judge
harshly people in the public eye for being human. The picture had
to accompany the letter, because otherwise the letter would have
looked like I was being judgmental. And the picture had to
accompany the letter because the picture exposed me to judgment.
And it was not an exhibitionistic thing. There (are) 40
photographers in Hyannis during the summer that photograph me
swimming (and the photos are) far more revealing. The reason I
(talked) about myself in the letter was just to reinforce (that) I
was not exempting myself from what I was talking about.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: So you came into the office and said I have this really
great idea, I'm going to write this piece and it's going to be
accompanied with a nude picture of me, (and everyone said), Great
idea, John.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: They were horrified. This is how I have to do it.
Listen, your magazine is obviously the product of some strong
opinions you have. And if a magazine is not reflective of one
person's soul, then it probably stinks. And sometimes, depending on
how I'm feeling, I just kind of let it loose. Otherwise, what's the
point, right? What's the point for me to have a magazine if I'm not
going to use it in some way that is personal?
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: You seem not overwhelmingly thrilled about being in the
public spotlight. Why do people keep saying that you're going to
run for office?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: (Laughs) I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Do you think you ever will?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I don't have any immediate desire to. Obviously this
magazine brings you right up against politics, and I like that.
However, do I feel a frustration about being an observer, not a
participant, sometimes? Yeah, because that's my background, that's
what I have in my blood. But, yet, would I want to go in, with the
hell that would envelop my life? Not at this juncture of my life. I
just got married. I like my privacy.

   John Kennedy, Jr., was famous even before he left the womb, and
his 38 years in the media glare as the son of one of this country's
most legendary politicians has informed his ideas about how
politics and its players should be covered by his magazine.
</P>
<P>
   On January 8, Kennedy sat down for an interview with editor in
chief Steven Brill and senior writer Abigail Pogrebin at the New
York headquarters of Hachette Filipacchi Magazines. Kennedy
explained why George fills a gap in political journalism and where
he thinks it has strayed. He didn't duck questions about how
personal his involvement is in the magazine, how he weathers the
carping of critics who say George is irrelevant, and why he thinks,
after three-plus years, he's proving them wrong. Edited excerpts of
the approximately 70-minute interview follow.
</P>
<P>
   STEVEN BRILL: What are you trying to do with the magazine?
</P>
<P>
   JOHN KENNEDY, Jr.: When we started, there (had) never really
been a political magazine for the general public in America that
(had) been commercially successful. So, basically, the idea was to
create a lifestyle magazine that was grounded in politics and
American history for a broad audience, particularly with reference
to people who hadn't really been drawn to political magazines
before -- women and young people.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: But what's a political lifestyle magazine?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: The idea was to make it accessible, and to make it
visual, and to make it entertaining -- as opposed to something you
had to read in order to be literate in your job and conversant in
the environment that you work (in). Which I think the National
Journals or the National Reviews or The New Republics are, for the
most part. And that it has the visual cues of a lifestyle magazine
-- that it be visually driven, that there be photographs, that
there be color, that there be a sense of vibrancy and a kind of
contemporary modern look, that are evocative of a fashion magazine
or an Entertainment Weekly.
</P>
<P>
   Fundamentally, one of the big problems with political magazines
before (was) that they really had not changed the way that they
looked in 40 years. They're text driven, they're black-and-white,
they're written mostly by men, mostly for men. And they don't
reflect a modern sensibility, which is to try to grab people's
attention and say, This is interesting. Politics is interesting.
You should know about it. Come read our magazine.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: So I read George this month, and I'm a 27-year-old middle
manager at Microsoft. Your perfect (reader), right? I read George
this month, and what do I know that I didn't know (before)?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: That's a difficult question. There might be certain
facts that are in the magazine that you didn't know. But the thing
that we really wanted to do was, for any well-rounded person,
politics is something one should be literate about, and people want
to be. Our idea was to make politics accessible to people who
wanted to have it close by, who wanted to read it and pick it up,
who could talk about politics with the same sort of informed
casualness that they might talk about the new movie coming out, or
a new record, or the NBA strike, or whatever. And the way that we
figured is the best way to do that is really through the people
that inhabit the political process, and to deal with them as
compelling personalities.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Give me an example of an article -- particularly in
recent issues -- that you think really is emblematic of the
mission.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I think that there are two main kinds of articles
(that) do that for us. One is a piece which has not appeared yet
(on Minnesota Democratic Senator) Paul Wellstone. (He) is not a
terribly well-known senator, but yet (was) probably going to run
for president. (He) is known as this kind of quirky eccentric
within the Senate, very liberal. And not much has been reported on
him. And he's had a fascinating life. He came from a very
interesting background, quite passionate, quite aggressive, and
feisty. He was a boxer, and that informs all his sensibilities. And
you read about him, and all of a sudden, instead of just a guy you
see who's in the Senate, you have a sense that you have a proximity
to him as a person, to his lifestyle, to his upbringing -- that you
didn't have before -- that I think only a magazine can do (and) TV
can't. Conversely, when you have familiar people who have a proven
ability to get the attention of the masses -- like a John Travolta
-- talking about politics, talking about what he thinks about it, I
think people are interested in that. Maybe not the Washington
cognoscenti, but I think that it's interesting for the kind of
people who we're going for to have that exchange. To hear
politicians talk about popular culture, (such as Ohio Republican
Congressman) John Kasich talking about his first Grateful Dead
concert, which (was) in an article that we had before, or Tony
Blankley (Newt Gingrich's former press secretary) on what it was
like to be a conservative who smoked marijuana in a university in
the late sixties.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: You just mentioned the difference between the cognoscenti
and everybody else. There seems to be a gap, in terms of the
perception of this magazine. Washington insiders say this magazine
does not have the inside story; there's no buzz about it on Capitol
Hill. But when we talk to the people who subscribe to it, they like
it. Does that bother you that there's that gap? Is that gap
bridgeable?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: We didn't want to be the National Journal. We've had
one politician on our cover, Newt Gingrich, and we've had an old
photograph of Richard Nixon. And when you have in your inaugural
issue Madonna talking about, ``If I were President,'' clearly it
had not been our objective to woo the folks in Washington. They
have The Hotline, they have C-SPAN, they have The (Weekly)
Standard, they have The New Republic. They have their own
discourse, their own conversations.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Do you care if they dismiss it?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Sure. No one likes to have their hard work dismissed.
But I don't lose sleep over that. (We) are the largest political
magazine in the country now, which is, after three years, an
achievement. We have the numbers, and we have the audience that we
wanted to get. And if the two shall meet, great -- and I think,
occasionally, that they do. I also think George is a little bit of
a closet read. There's a sense of George, particularly (for)
younger staffers, younger people on the Hill, (being) a paradigm of
politics that they understand. And if they don't read it to get the
latest on the budget debate, that's fine. But if they read it
because it's (got) an interesting article on Wellstone, or someone
got an interesting thing on (Arizona Republican Senator) John
McCain, and there's some great photographs that have never been
there before, then I think we've done our job.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: What do you think your biggest mistake has been,
editorially? What would you take back?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: (Pause) I think the magazine is more explicitly
political now. We maybe shoehorned, forced, the popular-culture
stuff in.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: What's an example?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I don't want to name names. Well, why not? Demi Moore
was doing, I think it was Striptease, right? That was going to be a
big movie. She has an affair in the movie with a senator, I think,
or something like that, so there was, tangentially, a political
aspect to it. And so we had her on the cover talking about sexual
politics. And that's not what people really want to hear about from
her. You can't just take any movie, and you can't just take any
person, 'cause people smell when you're trying to give them a bait
and switch. So now we confine ourselves to what movies are dealing
with a political topic, sort of a compelling social issue. For
instance, A Civil Action. There were other, more glamorous folks we
could have put on the cover, but they weren't going to be about a
political movie. And we sort of made the choice: We're going to
confine ourselves to these things. And we're not just going to put
someone in a string bikini on the cover.
</P>
<P>
   ABIGAIL POGREBIN: But when you say it's more explicitly
political now, do you mean it also has more politics?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Yeah. Because what we've found from researching was
that people like the proximity of the popular-culture aspects to
it. They got it. A lot of our reader mail is people who said, I
never thought I would like a political magazine before. I never
bought one. I'm really starting to understand it. I appreciate the
nonbiased aspect of it. But they don't want too much pop-culture
stuff in there. Just like in Rolling Stone, they don't want too
much politics. They want mostly music and a little bit of politics.
In our magazine they want mostly politics and a little bit of
popular culture. And when the balance gets out of whack, I think it
(becomes) a problem. Which is good for me, because actually I know
more about the political world than I do about the entertainment
world.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Tell me about your own involvement in the editorial
process. If I look through a table of contents, how many of the
stories in there -- big or little -- would be your ideas? KENNEDY:
It depends. Some issues more than others.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: In the current issue you've got (former) President Reagan
on the cover. Is that something where you said, Let's do that?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: What really happens is, we have meetings with the
senior staff, and there are things that interest me, and there are
things that interest them, and we talk about them. And, in a kind
of Socratic method, we vet the ideas. And the ones that stand up
under that scrutiny, and the ones (for) which we have a writer that
can deliver it, get done in the magazine. There was always, from
the beginning of this magazine, a certain skepticism of me. Was I
(the) front man for this?
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: That's why I'm asking.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Frankly, I'm not sure I want to dignify it with an
answer.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: That's why I didn't ask it directly.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: (Laughs) This enterprise has consumed almost now six
years of my life. It came at considerable, personal kind of risk.
There (were) a lot of people that would have loved to see this be a
farce, and it hasn't been. And I don't really care what people
think as far as my involvement. I care what the people who work
here think. And it works, and our readers seem to (think) we put
out a good product. So I'm as involved as (an) editor in chief
should be.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Do you read everything that's in the magazine?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Do I read every word? Mmm, no. I'll skim stories, and
I'll get very involved in some stories that I think are important,
and really line-edit (them). And other ones -- for instance, the
columnists -- I don't get as involved in, because they work with
separate editors.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: What about on the business side?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Well, I'm an owner, and not many editor in chiefs are
owners. And I think that since part of the mission of the magazine
is the challenge of Could you really marry the commercial
opportunities that magazines really need to live by and politics?,
(then) it's appropriate that I be the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: You sound defensive.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Oh, I'm not defensive. But I think it's quite important
that I proselytize, that I make the case for George.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: And that includes making the case to advertisers?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Oh, yeah. Absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: One ingredient it seems you've avoided is (what) I'll
call ``Your Tax Dollars at Work'' -- or anything about how the
government really works. Why doesn't a magazine about politics have
that kind of thing in the mix?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Well, I'm not sure I really agree that there isn't a
process aspect to the magazine because, actually, I think there is.
And particularly in the front of the book there is more (of that)
kind of the arcana of government and politics. The government-waste
thing is an old faithful, everyone does it. We do these top tens
every now and then that are sort of government excesses, or bad
laws, or failed bills, or what the do-nothing Congress didn't do.
But we don't want to fall back in a reflexive, antigovernment,
the-government-is-fleecing-you, politicians-are-fleecing-you
position. There's enough of that and we would rather sort of focus
on the things that are exclusive to us.
</P>
<P>
   POGREBIN: What about investigative pieces? Do you feel that's
something you want more of?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Yeah, I would love more. I mean, as you probably have
found, we did one on Scientology in Germany. We've done a couple on
the drug industry. Investigative pieces are difficult. We tried to
do one on the Apollo Theater (in New York); it didn't pan out. And
I find that investigative reporters are a really unique batch. And
that for every eight or ten that you assign, maybe you get two that
really work and really deliver the goods. BRILL: I always tell
people that if I were running a journalism school, I would get rid
of the whole curriculum. And the only thing that would happen is
that the students would be written about. The best training for any
journalist is to have someone write a profile on you, and have it
published in your hometown newspaper. Then you understand
everything about journalism. If I'm right, that makes you the best
qualified journalist on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: (Laughs) Right.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: How do you think your life makes you -- or doesn't make
you -- a more sensitive journalist, or (does it just make) you want
to be more vengeful?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I think, to be honest, it's an advantage and a
disadvantage. I have a perspective on politics that I would say is
unique, and one (that) I created a magazine around. There's been
enough written about my family that I have notions about
journalism, when it's practiced well and when it's not. However, I
think good journalism has a very strong point of view, and
downplays facts which go against you and plays up facts which
support you.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: A good piece should downplay facts that go against you?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Yeah, like in a good argument. Like a lawyer makes a
good argument. You are trying to persuade, and you craft an
argument accordingly. So I think that my own experience has made me
probably more sensitive to a fairness issue. And perhaps the pieces
have suffered, in that it's fun to read a really harsh, mean piece
about somebody.
</P>
<P>
   POGREBIN: What (does) it mean to you that something is
nonpartisan or postpartisan, words that you have used to describe
the magazine?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I think the current political imbroglio has indicated
that real people across America do not have the same investment in
partisan politics as people in Washington do. And I think that you
find people want solutions, people want government to work, they
want to feel good about politics. And they'll vote the person
rather than the issue a lot of the time. And I think that happens
increasingly. Part of the reason why I think the Washington
community maybe has not embraced George to the extent that readers
across America have (is that) there is a populist element to it. We
are interested in exploring the outsider sensibility about
politics. And that is kind of postpartisan -- or it's a lot more
nonpartisan than it is in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   POGREBIN: What I heard a lot from the (political and media)
elite was, if (George) had a point of view it would have more edge,
it would count more, it would matter more. But the readers said
they like it.They don't feel like anybody is coming down on one
side, and they're tired of that. But it does also feel like it's in
no-man's-land. Does that bother you?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: It is something which is the essential challenge of
this magazine. I think a lot of people expected there would be a
brief flurry of mouthing about (being) nonpartisan, and then it
would turn into John Kennedy's soapbox. And it can't be that. The
way you address that is, your stories have strong points of view,
and strong sensibilities, but that you have a variety of different
ones in there. The thing that people really respond to the most is
that they do feel that they are not being led around by the nose.
And in terms of Washington, we get a lot of access. Maybe they just
think that we'll just be nice to everybody. But I do think that
they think that there is an element of fairness, which, given my
own experience, is very important.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Suppose the magazine assigns a piece about somebody, and
that somebody doesn't want to pose for a photo. Would you assign a
photographer to ambush that person?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: It would never be necessary, because there's so much
pickup (photos available from agencies) of the people that we do. I
know what the question is -- would I assign a paparazzi? And it's
sort of a trite question, because you don't have to.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Let's see if I can make it a little less trite. Most of
the pickup you'd buy would be from those same paparazzi.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: No, not necessarily.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: But you wouldn't buy one of those shots, or you would?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: No, I would buy them. I would get the best pickup that
was available that I could.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Even if it's (a) photographer who ambushed someone?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I'm not a big moralizer about the paparazzi. I may not
like it, and it may be a difficult aspect of my life, but it's my
problem.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: You don't begrudge them doing the job they do?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: It's not something that I think is worth talking
(about). It's not a pressing public principle.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: If you were the editor of Salon, would you have reported
on the sex life of (Illinois Republican Congressman) Henry Hyde?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: We may not have done it, but was I dismayed that it
happened? No. Because I think that any time there is an element of
hypocrisy lingering, it's interesting to read about it.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: So you would or would not have done it?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I really don't know. For us to do it, it would have
looked weird. You know, it's inconsistent. There are obviously my
own family issues in which it looks hypocritical. It looks too
partisan. So would I have done it in our magazine? No. Salon is
obviously a magazine you know where they're coming from. They're
fighting that fight. So was it appropriate for them to do it? Yeah,
I think so. It's not as appropriate for us to do it.
</P>
<P>
   POGREBIN: When you sat down to do a Richard Mellon Scaife
interview, (a lot of reporters called it) a coup. Everybody wanted
(to talk to the millionaire well known for funding right-wing
publications and think tanks). And some people have said that you
have a kind of Larry King style of letting people's words speak for
themselves, but not necessarily nailing them to the wall. Is that
something that is conscious?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Well, I'm very flattered by the comparison. (Laughs) I
find interviews difficult, because I don't like to really do them,
present situation excluded, and I know, having done a few of them,
what makes me uncomfortable and what makes me feel noncooperative.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Which is what?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Which is sort of a sense that a reporter has an idea
already about what he wants this to come to. That you're not just
sitting down in a conversation and see(ing) where it will lead;
there's sort of a setup going on. And I just find the people I
interview are people whom I'm interested in. I worked in the Reagan
Justice Department during law school, I clerked for William
Bradford Reynolds in the civil-rights division. Not because I
agreed with him, but because I was just interested in how they
thought, which was obviously completely opposite to what I had
grown up with. So I just go in to an interview, and I just ask
questions that I am curious about. And, more often than not, it
starts out stilted, but, (as with) Richard Mellon Scaife, he just
felt comfortable, and he just talked. It's not my nature to be
inquisitorial; I think it is my nature to be curious. I'm thinking
about the people who read us. You're sort of being a proxy for
them.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Doesn't it drive you crazy to read the stuff that
belittles you and the magazine, when you're actually coming to work
every day?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Well, there's a lot less of it now than there was in
the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Did you ever think, Why did I get into this?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: No, because I knew that was going to happen. I knew
that it would irritate people no end -- the supreme irony of me
going and joining a media conglomerate to be a journalist! And then
to have it kind of work fairly well? I mean, we're still in
business, you know?
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: But you like to be liked
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I don't really like to be liked. I never look for
approval from the journalistic community. If it comes, great. But I
didn't really see that as the group that I had to answer to. And
then the more condescending it got, the more that I knew that I was
doing the right thing. But that has stopped now, I think. I mean,
we're like the Conan O'Brien of magazines. You know, we're still
here.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: In your column in the (February) issue, you (wrote)
something about how the idea of politicians as role models is a
fraud. That's what you think?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: No. I think that people don't think of politicians as
role models anymore, that there is an inherent contradiction. On
one side, we perpetuate the notion that politicians should be role
models, and on the other, we don't treat them as such.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Don't you think they can be, should be?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I think they are, merely by doing what they're doing.
And if they have a marital infidelity or if they did something in
college that they wouldn't do 20 years later, I don't think that
makes them a role model. But I think for an industry now that has
been (as) demarketed as politics, who wants to go into politics now
anymore? People just roll their eyes, and I think that's really
sad. When my father was president, there were 30 people covering
the White House. There are now 3,000, and they're all chasing the
same rabbit. So it becomes very difficult to maintain perfection
under that kind of scrutiny. You're putting an impossible burden on
them -- and you're setting yourself up for a sense of failure about
the political system. And I think that that burden is unfair, and
it makes good people stay away from government.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: I've got to ask you one snide, condescending question.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Sure.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Dustin Hoffman, Robert De Niro, John Travolta, Tom Hanks,
Christy Turlington, Johnny Depp. You're getting the point, right?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Mmm-hmm. BRILL: Bruce Willis, Charlize Theron, whoever
she is.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Hey, she's on the cover of Vanity Fair this month, and
we had her first.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Well, okay, fair enough. My point is, if you take the
last year of covers, with all of the movie stars, that package
doesn't say this is a magazine about politics. Are you doing with
the magazine what people get frustrated and angry at politicians
for, which is doing something that's popular, that brings in a
crowd, and then, after the election, changing the message on them?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I started this as a business, and my objective is that
this be a real business. Because if it's not a business then
there's no point in doing it. And I don't shy away from that.
Having familiar people from popular culture integrated within the
political content of our magazine, that is the essence of what the
magazine is, which is that politics has migrated into the realm of
popular culture. And in order to maintain the attention and the
interests of Americans, or viewers, they have to use the same kind
of attention-getting device as popular culture, that politicians
have to become personalities, in the show-business sense. And by
virtue of the fact that there's been an explosion of media,
personalities have an opportunity to become political. And that's
really the germ of what George magazine is saying. I think we've
made, perhaps, an error on one or two covers. I don't want to
offend her, but Charlize Theron I think was arguably one of those.
We were doing a thing about American folklore, and she was
commenting about America. It would really be unsatisfying to me to
have some somber politician on the cover, and we gather dust in the
back of some newsstand somewhere. I mean, if I sell 180,000 copies
of a political magazine -- man, I am happy. And so I could do
something else, with some drawing of (South Carolina Republican
Senator) Strom Thurmond and sell 20(,000), and maybe I'm serious
and consequential in Washington. But if the people that I'm trying
to reach are passing me by, then that's a failure.
</P>
<P>
   POGREBIN: What about Maureen Dowd's quote: ``Celebrity distorts
democracy, by giving the rich, beautiful and famous more authority
than they deserve?'' The idea that it's one thing to sell
magazines, but to give celebrities any sense of weight, (for
instance) what Pamela (Anderson) Lee has to say, is taking it a
step further than you should?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Maureen Dowd writes, as far as I can tell, mostly about
the personal, about celebrity, and about the personally trivial.
And it makes for interesting (reading). The reason why she's
interesting is because she writes about the most kind of
provocative personal points of people in politics. And so that
comment seems sort of freighted with contradiction coming from
where it does.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Should the media report about the sex lives of kids of
politicians?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: It depends how interesting their sex lives are.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: You really mean that?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I think it's a broad question. I think you should give
me a context.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Eleanor Mondale (the daughter of former vice-president
Walter Mondale and the subject of a gossipy February story that had
little connection to politics). That's the context.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Listen, I understand the irony in that story appearing
in George. But that's kind of a racy, fun story, and something that
I would read.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: And if she calls you up and says, ``How can you, of all
people, publish a story like that?''
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I'd say: ``Hey, man -- you know, I've been there. It's
a pain in the neck, but, you know, it ain't as bad as all that.''
</P>
<P>
   POGREBIN: Looking back on your famous editor's note (in which
Kennedy wrote about two of his cousins' marital problems and posed
tastefully nude for an accompanying picture), would you do anything
differently?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: That's almost one of (our) best-selling issues ever, so
I don't think so. Without reinterpreting the letter, because
hopefully the letter (spoke) for itself, though it was deliberately
oblique, I did that because that was something I wanted to say and
something that I had felt strongly about, which is, we judge
harshly people in the public eye for being human. The picture had
to accompany the letter, because otherwise the letter would have
looked like I was being judgmental. And the picture had to
accompany the letter because the picture exposed me to judgment.
And it was not an exhibitionistic thing. There (are) 40
photographers in Hyannis during the summer that photograph me
swimming (and the photos are) far more revealing. The reason I
(talked) about myself in the letter was just to reinforce (that) I
was not exempting myself from what I was talking about.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: So you came into the office and said I have this really
great idea, I'm going to write this piece and it's going to be
accompanied with a nude picture of me, (and everyone said), Great
idea, John.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: They were horrified. This is how I have to do it.
Listen, your magazine is obviously the product of some strong
opinions you have. And if a magazine is not reflective of one
person's soul, then it probably stinks. And sometimes, depending on
how I'm feeling, I just kind of let it loose. Otherwise, what's the
point, right? What's the point for me to have a magazine if I'm not
going to use it in some way that is personal?
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: You seem not overwhelmingly thrilled about being in the
public spotlight. Why do people keep saying that you're going to
run for office?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: (Laughs) I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Do you think you ever will?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I don't have any immediate desire to. Obviously this
magazine brings you right up against politics, and I like that.
However, do I feel a frustration about being an observer, not a
participant, sometimes? Yeah, because that's my background, that's
what I have in my blood. But, yet, would I want to go in, with the
hell that would envelop my life? Not at this juncture of my life. I
just got married. I like my privacy.

   John Kennedy, Jr., was famous even before he left the womb, and
his 38 years in the media glare as the son of one of this country's
most legendary politicians has informed his ideas about how
politics and its players should be covered by his magazine.
</P>
<P>
   On January 8, Kennedy sat down for an interview with editor in
chief Steven Brill and senior writer Abigail Pogrebin at the New
York headquarters of Hachette Filipacchi Magazines. Kennedy
explained why George fills a gap in political journalism and where
he thinks it has strayed. He didn't duck questions about how
personal his involvement is in the magazine, how he weathers the
carping of critics who say George is irrelevant, and why he thinks,
after three-plus years, he's proving them wrong. Edited excerpts of
the approximately 70-minute interview follow.
</P>
<P>
   STEVEN BRILL: What are you trying to do with the magazine?
</P>
<P>
   JOHN KENNEDY, Jr.: When we started, there (had) never really
been a political magazine for the general public in America that
(had) been commercially successful. So, basically, the idea was to
create a lifestyle magazine that was grounded in politics and
American history for a broad audience, particularly with reference
to people who hadn't really been drawn to political magazines
before -- women and young people.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: But what's a political lifestyle magazine?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: The idea was to make it accessible, and to make it
visual, and to make it entertaining -- as opposed to something you
had to read in order to be literate in your job and conversant in
the environment that you work (in). Which I think the National
Journals or the National Reviews or The New Republics are, for the
most part. And that it has the visual cues of a lifestyle magazine
-- that it be visually driven, that there be photographs, that
there be color, that there be a sense of vibrancy and a kind of
contemporary modern look, that are evocative of a fashion magazine
or an Entertainment Weekly.
</P>
<P>
   Fundamentally, one of the big problems with political magazines
before (was) that they really had not changed the way that they
looked in 40 years. They're text driven, they're black-and-white,
they're written mostly by men, mostly for men. And they don't
reflect a modern sensibility, which is to try to grab people's
attention and say, This is interesting. Politics is interesting.
You should know about it. Come read our magazine.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: So I read George this month, and I'm a 27-year-old middle
manager at Microsoft. Your perfect (reader), right? I read George
this month, and what do I know that I didn't know (before)?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: That's a difficult question. There might be certain
facts that are in the magazine that you didn't know. But the thing
that we really wanted to do was, for any well-rounded person,
politics is something one should be literate about, and people want
to be. Our idea was to make politics accessible to people who
wanted to have it close by, who wanted to read it and pick it up,
who could talk about politics with the same sort of informed
casualness that they might talk about the new movie coming out, or
a new record, or the NBA strike, or whatever. And the way that we
figured is the best way to do that is really through the people
that inhabit the political process, and to deal with them as
compelling personalities.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Give me an example of an article -- particularly in
recent issues -- that you think really is emblematic of the
mission.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I think that there are two main kinds of articles
(that) do that for us. One is a piece which has not appeared yet
(on Minnesota Democratic Senator) Paul Wellstone. (He) is not a
terribly well-known senator, but yet (was) probably going to run
for president. (He) is known as this kind of quirky eccentric
within the Senate, very liberal. And not much has been reported on
him. And he's had a fascinating life. He came from a very
interesting background, quite passionate, quite aggressive, and
feisty. He was a boxer, and that informs all his sensibilities. And
you read about him, and all of a sudden, instead of just a guy you
see who's in the Senate, you have a sense that you have a proximity
to him as a person, to his lifestyle, to his upbringing -- that you
didn't have before -- that I think only a magazine can do (and) TV
can't. Conversely, when you have familiar people who have a proven
ability to get the attention of the masses -- like a John Travolta
-- talking about politics, talking about what he thinks about it, I
think people are interested in that. Maybe not the Washington
cognoscenti, but I think that it's interesting for the kind of
people who we're going for to have that exchange. To hear
politicians talk about popular culture, (such as Ohio Republican
Congressman) John Kasich talking about his first Grateful Dead
concert, which (was) in an article that we had before, or Tony
Blankley (Newt Gingrich's former press secretary) on what it was
like to be a conservative who smoked marijuana in a university in
the late sixties.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: You just mentioned the difference between the cognoscenti
and everybody else. There seems to be a gap, in terms of the
perception of this magazine. Washington insiders say this magazine
does not have the inside story; there's no buzz about it on Capitol
Hill. But when we talk to the people who subscribe to it, they like
it. Does that bother you that there's that gap? Is that gap
bridgeable?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: We didn't want to be the National Journal. We've had
one politician on our cover, Newt Gingrich, and we've had an old
photograph of Richard Nixon. And when you have in your inaugural
issue Madonna talking about, ``If I were President,'' clearly it
had not been our objective to woo the folks in Washington. They
have The Hotline, they have C-SPAN, they have The (Weekly)
Standard, they have The New Republic. They have their own
discourse, their own conversations.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Do you care if they dismiss it?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Sure. No one likes to have their hard work dismissed.
But I don't lose sleep over that. (We) are the largest political
magazine in the country now, which is, after three years, an
achievement. We have the numbers, and we have the audience that we
wanted to get. And if the two shall meet, great -- and I think,
occasionally, that they do. I also think George is a little bit of
a closet read. There's a sense of George, particularly (for)
younger staffers, younger people on the Hill, (being) a paradigm of
politics that they understand. And if they don't read it to get the
latest on the budget debate, that's fine. But if they read it
because it's (got) an interesting article on Wellstone, or someone
got an interesting thing on (Arizona Republican Senator) John
McCain, and there's some great photographs that have never been
there before, then I think we've done our job.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: What do you think your biggest mistake has been,
editorially? What would you take back?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: (Pause) I think the magazine is more explicitly
political now. We maybe shoehorned, forced, the popular-culture
stuff in.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: What's an example?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I don't want to name names. Well, why not? Demi Moore
was doing, I think it was Striptease, right? That was going to be a
big movie. She has an affair in the movie with a senator, I think,
or something like that, so there was, tangentially, a political
aspect to it. And so we had her on the cover talking about sexual
politics. And that's not what people really want to hear about from
her. You can't just take any movie, and you can't just take any
person, 'cause people smell when you're trying to give them a bait
and switch. So now we confine ourselves to what movies are dealing
with a political topic, sort of a compelling social issue. For
instance, A Civil Action. There were other, more glamorous folks we
could have put on the cover, but they weren't going to be about a
political movie. And we sort of made the choice: We're going to
confine ourselves to these things. And we're not just going to put
someone in a string bikini on the cover.
</P>
<P>
   ABIGAIL POGREBIN: But when you say it's more explicitly
political now, do you mean it also has more politics?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Yeah. Because what we've found from researching was
that people like the proximity of the popular-culture aspects to
it. They got it. A lot of our reader mail is people who said, I
never thought I would like a political magazine before. I never
bought one. I'm really starting to understand it. I appreciate the
nonbiased aspect of it. But they don't want too much pop-culture
stuff in there. Just like in Rolling Stone, they don't want too
much politics. They want mostly music and a little bit of politics.
In our magazine they want mostly politics and a little bit of
popular culture. And when the balance gets out of whack, I think it
(becomes) a problem. Which is good for me, because actually I know
more about the political world than I do about the entertainment
world.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Tell me about your own involvement in the editorial
process. If I look through a table of contents, how many of the
stories in there -- big or little -- would be your ideas? KENNEDY:
It depends. Some issues more than others.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: In the current issue you've got (former) President Reagan
on the cover. Is that something where you said, Let's do that?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: What really happens is, we have meetings with the
senior staff, and there are things that interest me, and there are
things that interest them, and we talk about them. And, in a kind
of Socratic method, we vet the ideas. And the ones that stand up
under that scrutiny, and the ones (for) which we have a writer that
can deliver it, get done in the magazine. There was always, from
the beginning of this magazine, a certain skepticism of me. Was I
(the) front man for this?
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: That's why I'm asking.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Frankly, I'm not sure I want to dignify it with an
answer.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: That's why I didn't ask it directly.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: (Laughs) This enterprise has consumed almost now six
years of my life. It came at considerable, personal kind of risk.
There (were) a lot of people that would have loved to see this be a
farce, and it hasn't been. And I don't really care what people
think as far as my involvement. I care what the people who work
here think. And it works, and our readers seem to (think) we put
out a good product. So I'm as involved as (an) editor in chief
should be.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Do you read everything that's in the magazine?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Do I read every word? Mmm, no. I'll skim stories, and
I'll get very involved in some stories that I think are important,
and really line-edit (them). And other ones -- for instance, the
columnists -- I don't get as involved in, because they work with
separate editors.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: What about on the business side?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Well, I'm an owner, and not many editor in chiefs are
owners. And I think that since part of the mission of the magazine
is the challenge of Could you really marry the commercial
opportunities that magazines really need to live by and politics?,
(then) it's appropriate that I be the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: You sound defensive.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Oh, I'm not defensive. But I think it's quite important
that I proselytize, that I make the case for George.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: And that includes making the case to advertisers?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Oh, yeah. Absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: One ingredient it seems you've avoided is (what) I'll
call ``Your Tax Dollars at Work'' -- or anything about how the
government really works. Why doesn't a magazine about politics have
that kind of thing in the mix?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Well, I'm not sure I really agree that there isn't a
process aspect to the magazine because, actually, I think there is.
And particularly in the front of the book there is more (of that)
kind of the arcana of government and politics. The government-waste
thing is an old faithful, everyone does it. We do these top tens
every now and then that are sort of government excesses, or bad
laws, or failed bills, or what the do-nothing Congress didn't do.
But we don't want to fall back in a reflexive, antigovernment,
the-government-is-fleecing-you, politicians-are-fleecing-you
position. There's enough of that and we would rather sort of focus
on the things that are exclusive to us.
</P>
<P>
   POGREBIN: What about investigative pieces? Do you feel that's
something you want more of?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Yeah, I would love more. I mean, as you probably have
found, we did one on Scientology in Germany. We've done a couple on
the drug industry. Investigative pieces are difficult. We tried to
do one on the Apollo Theater (in New York); it didn't pan out. And
I find that investigative reporters are a really unique batch. And
that for every eight or ten that you assign, maybe you get two that
really work and really deliver the goods. BRILL: I always tell
people that if I were running a journalism school, I would get rid
of the whole curriculum. And the only thing that would happen is
that the students would be written about. The best training for any
journalist is to have someone write a profile on you, and have it
published in your hometown newspaper. Then you understand
everything about journalism. If I'm right, that makes you the best
qualified journalist on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: (Laughs) Right.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: How do you think your life makes you -- or doesn't make
you -- a more sensitive journalist, or (does it just make) you want
to be more vengeful?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I think, to be honest, it's an advantage and a
disadvantage. I have a perspective on politics that I would say is
unique, and one (that) I created a magazine around. There's been
enough written about my family that I have notions about
journalism, when it's practiced well and when it's not. However, I
think good journalism has a very strong point of view, and
downplays facts which go against you and plays up facts which
support you.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: A good piece should downplay facts that go against you?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Yeah, like in a good argument. Like a lawyer makes a
good argument. You are trying to persuade, and you craft an
argument accordingly. So I think that my own experience has made me
probably more sensitive to a fairness issue. And perhaps the pieces
have suffered, in that it's fun to read a really harsh, mean piece
about somebody.
</P>
<P>
   POGREBIN: What (does) it mean to you that something is
nonpartisan or postpartisan, words that you have used to describe
the magazine?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I think the current political imbroglio has indicated
that real people across America do not have the same investment in
partisan politics as people in Washington do. And I think that you
find people want solutions, people want government to work, they
want to feel good about politics. And they'll vote the person
rather than the issue a lot of the time. And I think that happens
increasingly. Part of the reason why I think the Washington
community maybe has not embraced George to the extent that readers
across America have (is that) there is a populist element to it. We
are interested in exploring the outsider sensibility about
politics. And that is kind of postpartisan -- or it's a lot more
nonpartisan than it is in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   POGREBIN: What I heard a lot from the (political and media)
elite was, if (George) had a point of view it would have more edge,
it would count more, it would matter more. But the readers said
they like it.They don't feel like anybody is coming down on one
side, and they're tired of that. But it does also feel like it's in
no-man's-land. Does that bother you?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: It is something which is the essential challenge of
this magazine. I think a lot of people expected there would be a
brief flurry of mouthing about (being) nonpartisan, and then it
would turn into John Kennedy's soapbox. And it can't be that. The
way you address that is, your stories have strong points of view,
and strong sensibilities, but that you have a variety of different
ones in there. The thing that people really respond to the most is
that they do feel that they are not being led around by the nose.
And in terms of Washington, we get a lot of access. Maybe they just
think that we'll just be nice to everybody. But I do think that
they think that there is an element of fairness, which, given my
own experience, is very important.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Suppose the magazine assigns a piece about somebody, and
that somebody doesn't want to pose for a photo. Would you assign a
photographer to ambush that person?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: It would never be necessary, because there's so much
pickup (photos available from agencies) of the people that we do. I
know what the question is -- would I assign a paparazzi? And it's
sort of a trite question, because you don't have to.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Let's see if I can make it a little less trite. Most of
the pickup you'd buy would be from those same paparazzi.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: No, not necessarily.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: But you wouldn't buy one of those shots, or you would?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: No, I would buy them. I would get the best pickup that
was available that I could.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Even if it's (a) photographer who ambushed someone?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I'm not a big moralizer about the paparazzi. I may not
like it, and it may be a difficult aspect of my life, but it's my
problem.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: You don't begrudge them doing the job they do?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: It's not something that I think is worth talking
(about). It's not a pressing public principle.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: If you were the editor of Salon, would you have reported
on the sex life of (Illinois Republican Congressman) Henry Hyde?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: We may not have done it, but was I dismayed that it
happened? No. Because I think that any time there is an element of
hypocrisy lingering, it's interesting to read about it.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: So you would or would not have done it?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I really don't know. For us to do it, it would have
looked weird. You know, it's inconsistent. There are obviously my
own family issues in which it looks hypocritical. It looks too
partisan. So would I have done it in our magazine? No. Salon is
obviously a magazine you know where they're coming from. They're
fighting that fight. So was it appropriate for them to do it? Yeah,
I think so. It's not as appropriate for us to do it.
</P>
<P>
   POGREBIN: When you sat down to do a Richard Mellon Scaife
interview, (a lot of reporters called it) a coup. Everybody wanted
(to talk to the millionaire well known for funding right-wing
publications and think tanks). And some people have said that you
have a kind of Larry King style of letting people's words speak for
themselves, but not necessarily nailing them to the wall. Is that
something that is conscious?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Well, I'm very flattered by the comparison. (Laughs) I
find interviews difficult, because I don't like to really do them,
present situation excluded, and I know, having done a few of them,
what makes me uncomfortable and what makes me feel noncooperative.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Which is what?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Which is sort of a sense that a reporter has an idea
already about what he wants this to come to. That you're not just
sitting down in a conversation and see(ing) where it will lead;
there's sort of a setup going on. And I just find the people I
interview are people whom I'm interested in. I worked in the Reagan
Justice Department during law school, I clerked for William
Bradford Reynolds in the civil-rights division. Not because I
agreed with him, but because I was just interested in how they
thought, which was obviously completely opposite to what I had
grown up with. So I just go in to an interview, and I just ask
questions that I am curious about. And, more often than not, it
starts out stilted, but, (as with) Richard Mellon Scaife, he just
felt comfortable, and he just talked. It's not my nature to be
inquisitorial; I think it is my nature to be curious. I'm thinking
about the people who read us. You're sort of being a proxy for
them.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Doesn't it drive you crazy to read the stuff that
belittles you and the magazine, when you're actually coming to work
every day?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Well, there's a lot less of it now than there was in
the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Did you ever think, Why did I get into this?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: No, because I knew that was going to happen. I knew
that it would irritate people no end -- the supreme irony of me
going and joining a media conglomerate to be a journalist! And then
to have it kind of work fairly well? I mean, we're still in
business, you know?
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: But you like to be liked
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I don't really like to be liked. I never look for
approval from the journalistic community. If it comes, great. But I
didn't really see that as the group that I had to answer to. And
then the more condescending it got, the more that I knew that I was
doing the right thing. But that has stopped now, I think. I mean,
we're like the Conan O'Brien of magazines. You know, we're still
here.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: In your column in the (February) issue, you (wrote)
something about how the idea of politicians as role models is a
fraud. That's what you think?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: No. I think that people don't think of politicians as
role models anymore, that there is an inherent contradiction. On
one side, we perpetuate the notion that politicians should be role
models, and on the other, we don't treat them as such.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Don't you think they can be, should be?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I think they are, merely by doing what they're doing.
And if they have a marital infidelity or if they did something in
college that they wouldn't do 20 years later, I don't think that
makes them a role model. But I think for an industry now that has
been (as) demarketed as politics, who wants to go into politics now
anymore? People just roll their eyes, and I think that's really
sad. When my father was president, there were 30 people covering
the White House. There are now 3,000, and they're all chasing the
same rabbit. So it becomes very difficult to maintain perfection
under that kind of scrutiny. You're putting an impossible burden on
them -- and you're setting yourself up for a sense of failure about
the political system. And I think that that burden is unfair, and
it makes good people stay away from government.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: I've got to ask you one snide, condescending question.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Sure.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Dustin Hoffman, Robert De Niro, John Travolta, Tom Hanks,
Christy Turlington, Johnny Depp. You're getting the point, right?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Mmm-hmm. BRILL: Bruce Willis, Charlize Theron, whoever
she is.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Hey, she's on the cover of Vanity Fair this month, and
we had her first.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Well, okay, fair enough. My point is, if you take the
last year of covers, with all of the movie stars, that package
doesn't say this is a magazine about politics. Are you doing with
the magazine what people get frustrated and angry at politicians
for, which is doing something that's popular, that brings in a
crowd, and then, after the election, changing the message on them?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I started this as a business, and my objective is that
this be a real business. Because if it's not a business then
there's no point in doing it. And I don't shy away from that.
Having familiar people from popular culture integrated within the
political content of our magazine, that is the essence of what the
magazine is, which is that politics has migrated into the realm of
popular culture. And in order to maintain the attention and the
interests of Americans, or viewers, they have to use the same kind
of attention-getting device as popular culture, that politicians
have to become personalities, in the show-business sense. And by
virtue of the fact that there's been an explosion of media,
personalities have an opportunity to become political. And that's
really the germ of what George magazine is saying. I think we've
made, perhaps, an error on one or two covers. I don't want to
offend her, but Charlize Theron I think was arguably one of those.
We were doing a thing about American folklore, and she was
commenting about America. It would really be unsatisfying to me to
have some somber politician on the cover, and we gather dust in the
back of some newsstand somewhere. I mean, if I sell 180,000 copies
of a political magazine -- man, I am happy. And so I could do
something else, with some drawing of (South Carolina Republican
Senator) Strom Thurmond and sell 20(,000), and maybe I'm serious
and consequential in Washington. But if the people that I'm trying
to reach are passing me by, then that's a failure.
</P>
<P>
   POGREBIN: What about Maureen Dowd's quote: ``Celebrity distorts
democracy, by giving the rich, beautiful and famous more authority
than they deserve?'' The idea that it's one thing to sell
magazines, but to give celebrities any sense of weight, (for
instance) what Pamela (Anderson) Lee has to say, is taking it a
step further than you should?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Maureen Dowd writes, as far as I can tell, mostly about
the personal, about celebrity, and about the personally trivial.
And it makes for interesting (reading). The reason why she's
interesting is because she writes about the most kind of
provocative personal points of people in politics. And so that
comment seems sort of freighted with contradiction coming from
where it does.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Should the media report about the sex lives of kids of
politicians?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: It depends how interesting their sex lives are.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: You really mean that?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I think it's a broad question. I think you should give
me a context.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Eleanor Mondale (the daughter of former vice-president
Walter Mondale and the subject of a gossipy February story that had
little connection to politics). That's the context.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Listen, I understand the irony in that story appearing
in George. But that's kind of a racy, fun story, and something that
I would read.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: And if she calls you up and says, ``How can you, of all
people, publish a story like that?''
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I'd say: ``Hey, man -- you know, I've been there. It's
a pain in the neck, but, you know, it ain't as bad as all that.''
</P>
<P>
   POGREBIN: Looking back on your famous editor's note (in which
Kennedy wrote about two of his cousins' marital problems and posed
tastefully nude for an accompanying picture), would you do anything
differently?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: That's almost one of (our) best-selling issues ever, so
I don't think so. Without reinterpreting the letter, because
hopefully the letter (spoke) for itself, though it was deliberately
oblique, I did that because that was something I wanted to say and
something that I had felt strongly about, which is, we judge
harshly people in the public eye for being human. The picture had
to accompany the letter, because otherwise the letter would have
looked like I was being judgmental. And the picture had to
accompany the letter because the picture exposed me to judgment.
And it was not an exhibitionistic thing. There (are) 40
photographers in Hyannis during the summer that photograph me
swimming (and the photos are) far more revealing. The reason I
(talked) about myself in the letter was just to reinforce (that) I
was not exempting myself from what I was talking about.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: So you came into the office and said I have this really
great idea, I'm going to write this piece and it's going to be
accompanied with a nude picture of me, (and everyone said), Great
idea, John.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: They were horrified. This is how I have to do it.
Listen, your magazine is obviously the product of some strong
opinions you have. And if a magazine is not reflective of one
person's soul, then it probably stinks. And sometimes, depending on
how I'm feeling, I just kind of let it loose. Otherwise, what's the
point, right? What's the point for me to have a magazine if I'm not
going to use it in some way that is personal?
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: You seem not overwhelmingly thrilled about being in the
public spotlight. Why do people keep saying that you're going to
run for office?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: (Laughs) I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Do you think you ever will?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I don't have any immediate desire to. Obviously this
magazine brings you right up against politics, and I like that.
However, do I feel a frustration about being an observer, not a
participant, sometimes? Yeah, because that's my background, that's
what I have in my blood. But, yet, would I want to go in, with the
hell that would envelop my life? Not at this juncture of my life. I
just got married. I like my privacy.

</P>
<P>
   For the so-called media elite, George has been an easy punching
bag. Its architect is the nation's unofficial heartthrob, who has
no prior experience in the magazine business. Critics say George's
articles are so short and digestible, that they're forgettable;
little new information sticks to your ribs. It regularly features
models and movie stars in various states of undress. (Kennedy
himself disrobed once for the picture that appeared alongside that
famous editor's note.) Washington insiders say they rarely read the
magazine, don't know anybody who does, and feel perfectly well
informed without it. They say that George doesn't matter, that its
articles don't make news or waves on the cocktail circuit, that
it's not clear what it's trying to be.
</P>
<P>
   But mention the circulation _ 419,214 _ and the pundits pause.
Hmm. That's respectable. If nobody reads George, who are all these
readers? By comparison, The New Republic, a more respected
political weekly, sells just under 100,000 copies. The Weekly
Standard, which was launched the same autumn as George, manages
just half that. (By contrast,Vanity Fair, George's main glossy
competitor, leaves it in the dust with more than 1 million
readers.)
</P>
<P>
   So does this mean George is a player after all? Nina Totenberg,
legal-affairs correspondent for National Public Radio, says, ``I
don't want to sound culturally illiterate, but I've never read it.
I don't mean to sound snippy, but why should I?'' She says her
reading list is an exercise in ``triage,'' and George doesn't make
the cut. ``I spend my life feeling guilty about what I'm not
reading. George isn't one of the ones I feel guilty about.'' Does
the fact that so many Americans put George in their reading pile
tell her anything about the country's political appetite? ``I don't
think George magazine is a political magazine,'' says Totenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Washington Post columnist David Broder says George's
journalism lacks heft. ``I'm not sure I've ever ripped a piece out
of George magazine and stuck it in my files,'' he says, ``which is
what I do with magazines when something is exceptionally well
reported or gives me new insight to something I may be writing
on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never heard anyone talk about a George piece,'' says
Michael Kelly, the editor of National Journal, a 6,500-circulation
political weekly, who says he hasn't read the magazine since he
perused the first few issues. ``It's pretty consciously not
serious. It's not intended for people who actually know anything
about politics or Washington....It's finding a new vehicle to
exploit the celebrity culture. That seems to be its editorial
mission.'' Kelly says George plays it so safe that there are no
surprises: ``It seems to be a magazine the point of which is to
reassure readers that James Carville really is James Carville and
Newt Gingrich really is Newt Gingrich _ with two new anecdotes.''
</P>
<P>
   The bashing rankles Kennedy. But he says he expected the early
obituaries, and he claims they've stopped. ``We're like the Conan
O'Brien of magazines,'' he laughs. ``We're still here.''

   For the so-called media elite, George has been an easy punching
bag. Its architect is the nation's unofficial heartthrob, who has
no prior experience in the magazine business. Critics say George's
articles are so short and digestible, that they're forgettable;
little new information sticks to your ribs. It regularly features
models and movie stars in various states of undress. (Kennedy
himself disrobed once for the picture that appeared alongside that
famous editor's note.) Washington insiders say they rarely read the
magazine, don't know anybody who does, and feel perfectly well
informed without it. They say that George doesn't matter, that its
articles don't make news or waves on the cocktail circuit, that
it's not clear what it's trying to be.
</P>
<P>
   But mention the circulation _ 419,214 _ and the pundits pause.
Hmm. That's respectable. If nobody reads George, who are all these
readers? By comparison, The New Republic, a more respected
political weekly, sells just under 100,000 copies. The Weekly
Standard, which was launched the same autumn as George, manages
just half that. (By contrast,Vanity Fair, George's main glossy
competitor, leaves it in the dust with more than 1 million
readers.)
</P>
<P>
   So does this mean George is a player after all? Nina Totenberg,
legal-affairs correspondent for National Public Radio, says, ``I
don't want to sound culturally illiterate, but I've never read it.
I don't mean to sound snippy, but why should I?'' She says her
reading list is an exercise in ``triage,'' and George doesn't make
the cut. ``I spend my life feeling guilty about what I'm not
reading. George isn't one of the ones I feel guilty about.'' Does
the fact that so many Americans put George in their reading pile
tell her anything about the country's political appetite? ``I don't
think George magazine is a political magazine,'' says Totenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Washington Post columnist David Broder says George's
journalism lacks heft. ``I'm not sure I've ever ripped a piece out
of George magazine and stuck it in my files,'' he says, ``which is
what I do with magazines when something is exceptionally well
reported or gives me new insight to something I may be writing
on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never heard anyone talk about a George piece,'' says
Michael Kelly, the editor of National Journal, a 6,500-circulation
political weekly, who says he hasn't read the magazine since he
perused the first few issues. ``It's pretty consciously not
serious. It's not intended for people who actually know anything
about politics or Washington....It's finding a new vehicle to
exploit the celebrity culture. That seems to be its editorial
mission.'' Kelly says George plays it so safe that there are no
surprises: ``It seems to be a magazine the point of which is to
reassure readers that James Carville really is James Carville and
Newt Gingrich really is Newt Gingrich _ with two new anecdotes.''
</P>
<P>
   The bashing rankles Kennedy. But he says he expected the early
obituaries, and he claims they've stopped. ``We're like the Conan
O'Brien of magazines,'' he laughs. ``We're still here.''

 &HT;    A tempting time for terrorists
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On New Year's Eve, millions of people will look up at
midnight to watch fireworks erupting into bright blooms of color.
But security experts fear that in some places, the thunderous booms
will come from real bombs bursting in air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next Jan. 1 will probably set an all-time record for the
number of bombings in a single day,'' said Neil Livingstone, chief
executive of GlobalOptions, a Washington-based crisis management
firm. ``We have every reason to believe that people are going to
try to mark that date'' for acts of terrorism, both in the United
States and overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Livingstone said the risk of terrorism could be considerable for
several reasons. For one, very large crowds will be gathered in
easily accessible spots, with plenty of TV cameras rolling. A
terrorist group that wants to make global headlines might well
target New York City's Times Square, where throngs will be
assembled and police will have relatively little control.
</P>
<P>
   Also, many wealthy, powerful people will be staging elaborate
parties in exotic locations where terrorist groups have operations.
For example, thousands of well-heeled travelers plan to watch the
dawn of 2000 in the shadow of the Egyptian pyramids. Terrorists
have often targeted tourists in Egypt and probably will find the
New Year's parties exceptionally inviting marks, Livingstone
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Midnight madness might also be unleashed by doomsday cult
members who believe Jan. 1 will trigger an apocalypse. To make sure
their predictions come true, the groups might try shaking up the
world by exploding bombs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, terrorists may choose Dec. 31 as a target because
of the so-called Y2K bug, a widespread software flaw that could
cause many computers to misread the date rollover. If computers
malfunction amid the date confusion, all sorts of systems might go
haywire, leaving some cities without power, properly functioning
traffic lights or other vital services. Without electricity and
properly functioning 911 phone lines, cities could be very
vulnerable to attacks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics might note that Livingstone's company stands to profit
from fears about Jan. 1 chaos. But at least one national security
heavyweight backs up Livingstone's claims.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Adm. William Crowe, head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
under Presidents Reagan and Bush, has affiliated himself with the
firm, saying he gets no pay for his advisory work and is motivated
only by concern for his country.
</P>
<P>
   Crowe, who appeared recently with Livingstone at a news
conference in Washington, said he fears ``the millennium is going
to usher in a period of intense activity'' among terrorists.
Livingstone and Crowe recommend that individuals, companies and
governments make emergency plans to cope with terrorist attacks and
stock up on vital supplies and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Even if terrorists don't strike, travel in some parts of the
world may become very dangerous because of Y2K problems. Last week,
John Koskinen, head of the President's Council on Year 2000, said
the State Department plans to release a list of countries that
should be avoided in late December and January.
</P>
<P>
   The travel advisory, to be issued by Oct. 1, will list countries
in Asia, Africa and Latin America that are so far behind in fixing
Y2K-related problems that the basic infrastructure might fail.
</P>
<P>
   Adventurers who already have reservations for Egypt or other
foreign spots may want to change their plans after hearing Crowe's
assessment or the State Department's warnings. But if they do,
chances are they won't get their money back.
</P>
<P>
   Many insurers are warning travelers that cancellations caused by
the Y2K bug may not be covered by traditional vacation insurance
policies. The policies would cover theft losses or medical
treatments caused during Y2K chaos, but not the cost of the plane
ticket if an airline were shut down by computer problems.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the ability to file any claim will depend on the
insurer's ability to keep its own computers running. All of which
makes that popcorn party in Grandma's basement sound surprisingly
appealing.

 &HT;    Survey finds instant Floridians
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ How many people who live in Florida see a
Floridian when they look in the mirror?
</P>
<P>
   More than you'd think, according to a recent poll.
</P>
<P>
   Leadership Florida, a nonprofit organization founded by the
Florida Chamber of Commerce, just released a poll in which 71
percent of nonnative Floridians said, ``getouddaheah, of course I'm
a Floridian.'' Or words to that effect.
</P>
<P>
   About three in four Floridians _ regardless of whether they
consider themselves as such _ came here from somewhere else. The
Northeast creates most Floridians, according to the survey. And
even though Florida remains a place where New Yorkers consider
themselves an ethnic group, the survey suggests that most migrants
consider themselves Floridians as soon as their boxes are put away.
</P>
<P>
   This quick identification with the Sunshine State is reassuring.
It means we are something more than a theme park full of colorfully
dressed people waiting for their plane out and letters of transit.
Yet it is easy to wonder how deeply this identification really
runs.
</P>
<P>
   On the same page of the newspaper as the survey story was
another article with other numbers that told a different story.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 16 percent of all people who died in Florida were
shipped out of the state for burial. No fewer than 25,525 people
crossed the state line feet first.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, a significant number of people think Florida is
a nice a place to die but they wouldn't want to be buried here.
</P>
<P>
   Transporting corpses has become such a big business that Daytona
Beach International Airport has announced incentives to encourage
funeral homes to ship local bodies from the local airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bring out your dead!'' could be the airport's new slogan.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I don't blame anyone who waits until he's dead to get back
together with his relatives. In a lot of families that's more than
understandable. Others may have promised that they'd be dead before
they set foot in their hometown again so their relatives are merely
carrying out their stated wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this does say something fairly basic about folks' sense
of identity and which ground they truly consider home after the
last inning is played. Regardless of what they may have told the
person from a polling firm who was holding the questionnaire and a
clipboard, a lot of people wouldn't be caught dead here.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida roots run shallow.
</P>
<P>
   There's another difficulty here that's hard for polls to
measure. Although 71 percent of nonnatives consider themselves
Floridian _ slightly more in north Florida, slightly less on
Central Florida's east coast including Volusia, Flagler and Brevard
counties _ I don't know how many of them could tell you what a
Floridian is. What kind of identity is elastic enough to inspire
spirited assent from pine barrens of Okaloosa County to Calle Ocho
in Miami?
</P>
<P>
   If I were taking the survey, I'd ask a few follow-up questions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Do you consider flip-flops shoes, so that when you see a sign
that says ``No shoes, no shirt, no service'' you automatically
figure yourself OK?
</P>
<P>
   _ Do you generally ignore any palmetto bug that's as big as a
flip-flop or silently stare one down until it self-consciously
hides itself behind the toaster?
</P>
<P>
   _ Do you ever roll down your car window in July for any reason
other than ordering in a drive-through?
</P>
<P>
   _ Do you consider forest fires a weather condition?
</P>
<P>
   _ Have you found yourself asking the question ``What
thunderstorm?''
</P>
<P>
   _ Do you find it unsurprising that it is hot and humid in
August?
</P>
<P>
   _ Do you consider floating a water sport?
</P>
<P>
   _ Do you have difficulty recalling the exact temperature at
which water freezes?
</P>
<P>
   _ Have you been here for more than 48 hours?
</P>
<P>
   If you answered yes to the above and own a Jimmy Buffet CD,
you're probably justified in checking the ``Floridian'' box.
</P>
<P>
   And I'd take the survey in August, too. It is the month that
separates the Floridians from the visitors. But then, no real
Floridian would do much of anything in August. Least of all, answer
a lot of nosey survey questions.

 &HT;    Having your computer fixed can be a nightmarish experience
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ In January, a local consultant's personal
computer crashed, and he took it to the repair counter at an
electronics store.
</P>
<P>
   After 64 days and a dozen conflicting excuses, Ted Fowler, the
consultant, finally got his computer back and it still didn't work
properly.
</P>
<P>
   Though Fowler's experience was extreme, he, unfortunately, is
not alone.
</P>
<P>
   Computers are complex machines, and most home users have only a
foggy idea of their internal workings.
</P>
<P>
   And let's face it: Computers can develop glitches faster than
adolescents develop zits.
</P>
<P>
   So if you're a home computer user, chances are good your machine
is going to need to be repaired at some point.
</P>
<P>
   Tales of woe
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton Daily News recently asked readers to call and write
about their computer repair experiences, and a few were satisfied
with the service they had received.
</P>
<P>
   But others had real horror stories, and the primary complaint
from disgruntled customers was the way computer repair technicians
and businesses treated them.
</P>
<P>
   They said technicians were flippant, condescending, deceitful
and incompetent. The repair people tended to treat customers as
annoyances rather than as the source of their livelihoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed to me they couldn't care less whether it was done
when they said it would be done,'' said Doug Berger of suburban
Dayton, who took a computer to a Miamisburg, Ohio, repair shop.
``The second time I called them to find out what was going on with
my machine, they wouldn't tell me a thing. All they would say was
they would call me when they were finished.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger has had several bad experiences with computer repair. He
said this past spring he started having trouble with his Web
browser disappearing from the screen while he was online.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made seven different calls to America Online,'' he said. ``I
got seven different technicians who gave me seven different reasons
for my problem. None of them helped.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger eventually took his computer to the small shop. After
several broken promises from the shop, Berger said finally got a
working machine back.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Fowler was not so lucky. Fowler is the managing principal of
a consulting firm that works in value analysis, and his computer
crashed after becoming infected with a virus in January.
</P>
<P>
   He took it to the repair department at a Best Buy store Jan. 26,
explained the problem and was charged about $400 for a repair.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later he called the store and spent seven minutes on
the phone before reaching the technician who took his repair order.
Fowler said the technician told him, ``I have been busy on the
counter. I haven't had time to look at your computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Fowler said at this point he began to get irritated and started
taking notes on his exchanges with Best Buy. The notes were later
used to write a 12-page affidavit he sent to Best Buy executives.
</P>
<P>
   According to the affidavit, his computer was shipped back and
forth from Trotwood, Ohio, to a repair center in Cleveland for two
months before he finally got it back along with an additional bill
of $82. In the meantime, he talked to Best Buy officials more than
30 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lying and incompetence and not caring about the customer
were just amazing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Best Buy said the computer was finished, Fowler said
he continued to get error messages every time he turned it on.
</P>
<P>
   He took it to another shop, A.C.E. Computer Helpers and a
technician there discovered what he said were major errors made by
Best Buy. It cost Fowler another $260, but now he says his machine
works perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler said after he sent his affidavit to the Chief Executive
Officer of Best Buy, the company sent him a gift certificate for
$100.
</P>
<P>
   Joy Harris, a spokesperson for Best Buy, said Fowler's case was
``unfortunate and very unusual,'' but she said Best Buy has had
problems with equipment being in the repair loop too long. She said
repairs lasting 20 days were not unusual, but the company has made
improvements lately.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said Best Buy has instituted a program that will try to
ensure that computer will be repaired within five days.
</P>
<P>
   Good experiences
</P>
<P>
   Not every customer who needs a computer repair walks into a
quagmire.
</P>
<P>
   Leroy Van Allen of Sidney, Ohio, for example, bought a computer
at Stillwater Microsystems in Piqua, Ohio, in December 1997 and
says he's had excellent service.
</P>
<P>
   A week after Van Allen bough the computer, he purchased a
program that refused to install, an infuriating situation many
users have faced.
</P>
<P>
   He took the computer back to the dealer, and technicians there
downloaded a program patch from the Internet and installed it on
computer while he waited. Van Allen didn't have Internet access at
the time, and the company also downloaded the latest video card
driver and installed it at no charge.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the experience of the readers interviewed for this
article, there seems to be two keys to having a good computer
repair experience.
</P>
<P>
   The first key is learning as much as possible about your own
machine and doing as much trouble-shooting as possible without
taking the computer to a repair shop.
</P>
<P>
   The second key is choosing a repair technician carefully. You
should know specifically who is working on your machine and if that
technician fails in some way, find another.
</P>
<P>
   Glenna Cooper of Miamisburg is a good example of the value of
understanding computers. She bought her first computer in 1986 and
discovered when she turned it on that it had no operating programs
at all.
</P>
<P>
   Using manuals and books she bought she gradually learned to
write her own programs. Now Cooper's family has three computers and
a laptop at home. ``Any time the kids or my husband crashed the
computer, I just simply fixed it very easily,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The most important accessories home computer users own are the
manuals that came with their system and software. Never throw away
a manual, and always reread the relevant sections when a problem
crops up.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, every time you buy a new program or accessory, you
must immediately register the purchase with the manufacturer. Most
manufacturers offer telephone or online assistance for their
customers, but you usually have to register to qualify for help.
</P>
<P>
   When you call for help be prepared to explain the exact
circumstances of your problem. What goes wrong and what seems to
cause it? Also print out or jot down any error messages that pop up
when the problem occurs.
</P>
<P>
   Hold on to all your receipts and warranty documents. If a
product is faulty, it's better to have the manufacturer pay for the
repair if possible.
</P>
<P>
   It also pays to be connected to the Internet. Because computer
software and hardware are made by so many different companies and
their configurations change constantly, you may have to download
upgrades and patches to make the products you buy work together.
</P>
<P>
   You also should be careful when you buy software and
accessories. Read the packages thoroughly to be sure the purchases
are compatible with your computer.
</P>
<P>
   Getting help
</P>
<P>
   An alternative to knowing everything about your computer is
associating with people who do. Joining a user group is a good idea
if you often have trouble getting your computer to operate
properly.
</P>
<P>
   Mona Spurgeon, president of the Dayton Area Computer User Group,
said members regularly bring ailing computers to meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mean to brag, but we've never had anybody who had to
go outside the club for a repair,'' Spurgeon said.
</P>
<P>
   You may have noticed that many computer repair technicians are
quite young. That's probably not just a coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Shelton, director of public relations for CompUSA, said
the chain typically recruits its technicians through high
school-level vocational programs. She said the company asks
vocational school instructors for the names of outstanding
students, and the students who are hired are sent through a
five-day certification course.
</P>
<P>
   Each company is different, however.
</P>
<P>
   Computer Edge in Dayton, for example, is basically a one-man
operation run by owner David Horn.
</P>
<P>
   Horn has only run his repair and sales company for about 18
months, but he's been involved with computers for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a lot of business through word of mouth,'' Horn said.
``Some consumers may be apprehensive to turn their computers over
to kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Having your computer repaired can be an intimidating experience,
but you should can increase your chance at having a good experience
by doing some homework.
</P>
<P>
   Before taking your computer in for repair or summoning a repair
service to your home, quiz friends and acquaintances about their
experiences. Ask questions not only about which companies did good
work for them but also about which individual technicians they
found helpful.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid repair shops that have failed to complete work on time for
others without giving a very valid reason.
</P>
<P>
   Never leave your computer with a technician who doesn't listen
carefully to your problems. A technician should ask questions about
your experience with the machine before jumping in with proposed
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   If possible, have the technician run a quick diagnostic program
while you watch. Have the technician repeat the steps that usually
lead to the failure you want fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Get a written estimate spelling out what the problems are and
how they are to be corrected. The estimate should indicate the
company will get your authorization before exceeding the estimated
amount.
</P>
<P>
   If components are replaced, get the components that were
removed.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes your only option is to be patient; after all, no
technician can fix a computer if a needed part hasn't arrived yet.
But if a particular company makes a habit of disappointing you _
moving back the time when your computer will be ready, finding
problems they'd previously overlooked, failing to keep you
informed, etc. _ keep notes and records of your experience.
</P>
<P>
   Complain to management about a technician's poor performance and
perhaps your job will move up the priority scale a little.
</P>
<P>
   If one repair shop turns out to be hopeless, you may be better
off simply retrieving your machine. Some readers said even though
they had to pay a bad shop basically for doing nothing, it was
worth it to get their machine to a more capable technician.
</P>
<P>
   When you find a repairer who is reliable and reasonably priced
make sure every computer user you know hears about it.

 &HT;    Sites cover Fido, Fluffy and every possible pet
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's more than one way to name a cat.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a pet lover, the Web is littered with sites that can
help _ whether your pet of choice is a Chihuahua or a king snake.
Let's start with a good general purpose site called petlinks.com,
located understandably enough at www.petlinks.com/.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing you'll notice is a rather busy page filled with
text. But the absence of graphics means the page loads fast, and
the text is an elaborate system of links for almost every type of
pet you can imagine.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, if rodents are your thing, you'll appreciate the
links for rats, mice, gerbils, squirrels and chinchillas. For more
popular pets like cats or dogs, you'll find a series of links to
everything from shelters to trainers.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a nice search feature so, if you aren't sure what
category to check, you can use a search word to find your topic
fast. There's also a link for a live chat section, where you can
have typed real-time conversations with other pet fanciers.
</P>
<P>
   The next site _ called the Tame Beast _ is also a general
collection of pet links. It can be found at www
</P>
<P>
   .tamebeast.com/. The organization is a bit different here.
Instead of a list of possible pets on the starting page (and you'll
find that as well), there are links for topics such as ``working
animals,'' ``fun sites,'' ``live cam sites'' and for searching past
articles about pets.
</P>
<P>
   There's an impressive amount of information here, most of it to
be found in links to other sites outside the Tame Beast. For
instance, if you click on ``cat,'' you'll get literally hundreds of
links to other sites.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe that even the most passionate cat fancier
would have the time or the inclination to visit each of the sites.
But since there's a capsule summary of each site, you can winnow
down the list to just the sites with the information you want.
</P>
<P>
   Our next stop is a commercial site sponsored by Ralston-Purina.
You'll find it at petquarters.petkare.com/.
</P>
<P>
   This site focuses strongly on cats and dogs. Since those two
animals make up most of this country's pet population, the site
will appeal to many. The good features here include meaty sections
on choosing a veterinarian, essays on basic care for dogs and cats,
a pet column and _ as you'd expect from a pet food company _ lots
of data about nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   While you need to keep in mind that this is sponsored by a
company that would love to sell pet food to you, the nutrition
information is in-depth and seems unbiased. You'll learn about
special diets for cats with urinary tract problems and ways to keep
an older animal healthy.
</P>
<P>
   One of the places where the Ralston-Purina connection helps is
in a section that explains the ins and outs of reading the label on
a pet food can. There's an amazing amount of information to be
mined there.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, let's go back to that notion that there's more than one
way to name a cat.
</P>
<P>
   If that's what you have in mind, take a look at a site called
2000 cat names. It borrows a theme from several sites that offer a
list of names for new babies. It can be located at www.petrix.com
</P>
<P>
   /catnames/.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the names are fairly strange _ Jabberwocky and J. Edgar,
for instance _ but then so are cats.

 &HT;    Speakers out of sight, out of mind
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ If you want to hide the speakers for your high
fidelity sound system so they blend perfectly with the decor of
your rooms, you basically have to cut into walls and ceilings to
install recessed speakers and the wiring to connect them.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're willing to have the speakers minimally visible,
you can choose a flat panel speaker that hangs on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Infinity Systems Inc., part of the Harman Consumer Group of
audiovisual products, offers a full-performance speaker only 1 1/2
inches deep. The FPS-100 Flat Panel Loudspeaker measures just over
25 inches high and just under 12 inches wide and is designed to
hang on a wall in about the same space a framed painting might
occupy.
</P>
<P>
   According to a press release from Infinity, the FPS-1000 uses a
slim-profile, advanced technology 5-inch woofer with a 5-inch
passive radiator and a 1-inch-high performance tweeter. The tweeter
can be rotated to direct sound to anywhere in the room.
</P>
<P>
   The speakers have a suggested retail price of $599 a pair and
come with 40 feet of flat speaker wire.
</P>
<P>
   You can log on to www.infinitysystems.com and click on the
``On-line shopping'' icon at the bottom of the home page. That will
link you to several dealers who sell Infinity products via the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you're just interested in flat speakers, you don't
necessarily have to go with the FPS-1000 model. Check middle- and
high-end audio dealers for their offerings in slim line sound
equipment.

 &HT;    Closing the curtain on my Peeping Tom
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Police in Schaumberg, Ill., have arrested a
Peeping Tom and charged him with looking through his neighbors'
windows _ regularly. The peeper says, yeah, he did it. Probably 20
times. His hearing is coming up.
</P>
<P>
   Many years ago, my husband, infant son, and I moved to a small
town down South. It was a picturesque place with well-tended
antebellum homes lining the main street, and a courthouse square in
the center of town where old guys played checkers on the lawn. The
house we were renting nestled under some shady trees with a little
stream at the bottom of the hill. It was summer when we moved in.
</P>
<P>
   Most days (and nights) we sweltered under the relentless
Southern sun. Windows were flung wide and curtains left open to
snag any wayward breeze. My husband and I weren't worried about
offending the neighbors because the house sat on a hilltop, making
our windows well above anyone's line of sight. All was peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   Our son's room was just a few steps down the hall and on the
nights when my airline pilot husband was away, I kept a small lamp
burning so I could check on the baby without destroying the
furniture and my shins. Little did I know my light in the window
was to become a beacon in the night to my very own ``Tom.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom was an attractive, pleasant young man in his late twenties.
He didn't work, but that was OK because, according to his momma,
``Tom will be fine once he finds himself.'' Once or twice a week,
Tom would stop by to see if we needed anything since his daddy
owned the house we were renting. I thought that was real sweet.
</P>
<P>
   One particularly hot night, three or four days after we'd moved
in, my husband was away on a trip and I was lying in bed reading
when I heard a curious noise. Naturally, I checked on my son first.
He and the Siamese cat were zonked out, amicably sharing the
oversized crib. All seemed well, so I went back to bed. This
situation replayed for the next two nights until my husband came
home. The noise stopped and I forgot to mention it.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of days later, we were on the screened porch when a
neighbor stopped by. Over a tall glass of sweet tea he filled us in
on the locals. ``Ol' Joe Dan, he's a good ol' boy. Not too swift,
but he can sure fix lawnmowers.'' Ol' Lamar was the guy to see for
the best scuppernong wine in town. We were advised to drink it
sparingly though because it was laced with 'shine from the
sheriff's own supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then there's ol' Tom Bo. He just lives around the corner
from you. His granddaddy was governor and his daddy, F. Billy, has
got that big law office in town.'' We told him we knew F. Billy.
That we rented our house from him. I forgot to mention I'd met Tom
Bo.
</P>
<P>
   The longer our visitor talked, the more I was feeling like a
character in one of Faulkner's short stories. ``Tom Bo's a good
young 'un, ya' know? Real polite. Course, he's never had a job and
he still lives at home. Once in a while he runs a few errands for
his daddy and at lunchtime he brings in egg salad sandwiches and
Coca-Cola from the drug store for the folks at the law office. He's
never been any (SET ITAL)big(END ITAL) problem for his folks.'' I
had an irresistible urge to know about the (SET ITAL)little(END
ITAL) problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom Bo's kind of a curious fella, doncha' know? Gets a big
kick out of looking in folks' windows. Just in case you notice him
looking in yours sometime, his daddy would appreciate it if instead
of calling the police, you'd just give him a call. He'll come and
take the boy home.'' I suggested our windows were too high for Tom
Bo, but the visitor said the boy brings his own ladder as well as a
night's supply of candy bars and Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly, I excused myself, stepped outside and around to the
bedroom windows. Sure enough, the ground was littered with candy
wrappers and empty Coke bottles. Ol' Tom Bo was in business.
</P>
<P>
   Might as well fit in, I told myself later as I wrote F. Billy's
number on a slip of paper and stuck it under the bedside phone
because, as the old song goes, `` ... nothing could be done because
he was the mayor's son?''

 &HT;    Web isn't interwoven with much of the world
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The typical Internet user worldwide is male, under 35
years old, with a university education and high income, urban-based
and English speaking.
</P>
<P>
   This profile of the average Web surfer comes from the
just-published ``Human Development Report 1999,'' commissioned by
the United Nations Development Program. The 260-page study touched
on a variety of issues concerning the worldwide distribution of
wealth and technology. It concluded that while technological
advances may be improving life for many, it's also widening the gap
between rich and poor.
</P>
<P>
   North America, with less than 5 percent of the population, has
more computers than the rest of the world combined. South Asia,
with 23 percent of the world's people, has less than 1 percent of
the world's Internet users. The study also reports that 80 percent
of all Web sites are in English, which is spoken by less than 10
percent of the world's population.
</P>
<P>
   The study also noted that Internet connections cost an average
of about $10 a month for Americans but can cost upward of $100 in
Africa. A computer costs the average American one month's pay but
would cost the average Bangladeshi eight years' income.
</P>
<P>
   Even if it were possible to wire developing countries quickly
and inexpensively, people in those countries without basic computer
skills would still have little access to electronic commerce. Nor
would they have access to any of the basic functions such as
sending e-mail or access to educational opportunities available via
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The study has some solutions for leveling out the worldwide
inequalities, including a possible ``bit tax'' on e-mail that has
sent editorial page editors from Canada to Canberra into a frenzy
that should keep them going for months.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of information is troubling, partially because there
is not a lot average citizens can do about it _ except feel vaguely
guilty that they aren't doing something about it. There are some
people, such as Intel's PC Dads, who travel the country teaching
parents and educators computer basics, and Richard Kenyada of
Decatur, who works on his own time to bring computers and know-how
into the African-American community.
</P>
<P>
   Still, nearly everyone working to increase computer access and
raise computer literacy levels will tell you that bridging the
digital divide in the United States is hard enough without
literally throwing the weight of the world's problems onto the pile
as well.
</P>
<P>
   There are things we do almost without thinking in the United
States that are not possible in many parts of the world. Every day,
millions of Americans are trading stocks, uploading photos of the
grandchildren, reading articles from Salon or buying Bruce
Springsteen music at CDNow.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen million people have access to America Online and pay
only $21.95 a month, which many argue is way too much.
Mademoiselle, a women's magazine targeted at twentysomething
working women, features Web addresses at the end of every story.
During the Super Bowl, lingerie maker Victoria's Secret put its Web
address in a 30-second TV ad, and millions of Americans (presumably
the under-35 white males the study mentions) dashed to their
computers to check it out. There are very few places in the world,
the study says, where a great portion of the population has not
only the skills but the resources to do such things.
</P>
<P>
   Many people may remember being told as children to eat
everything on their dinner plates because children are starving in
India. Lots of kids wondered how eating all of mom's meatloaf would
make life better for a starving 8-year-old in Calcutta. The answer
is simple: It doesn't. The point of even being asked to clean your
plate was to make you realize how lucky you were to have a full
plate of food in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   So the next time you're out pricing computers at the mall or at
home online getting slightly miffed because the Ticketmaster Web
site is down, remember what we think of as an absolute necessity is
still a remote, almost incomprehensible dream for most of the
world's population.

 &HT;    Wired lends an ear to music revolution
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's a revolution under way in how people will be
able to buy and receive music and videos. Of course, it involves
the Net. Read all about the coming change in the August issue of
Wired. The magazine features a series of stories about new digital
distribution technology, including MP3. Wired's article includes a
fun chart depicting the new technology and how it works.
</P>
<P>
   Treat your PC like a sports car. That's the advice in the August
issue of PC World magazine. It features a series of articles that
show you how to tune, fix up and boost the power of most PCs. These
articles will show you how to tell if your PC is on the blink and,
even if it's working fine, how to make it more powerful.
</P>
<P>
   The same issue of PC World also has an interesting piece
reviewing the new PalmPilot VII. This is the model that introduced
wireless communications to the hand-held computing world. You can
use the PalmPilot VII to send and receive e-mail and visit a
limited number of Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   ``Links Extreme,'' a new Microsoft release, features a novel
twist on golf simulation CDs. In the game, you can play on a
demolition driving range where the golf balls will explode. Another
course offers a 100-foot skeleton as a practice target. You get the
idea. The game contains mild animated violence. It's available only
for PCs with Windows 95 or higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tetris'' was one of the original games for Nintendo's GameBoy.
It's changed over the years, adding cool graphics and colors and
migrating to other game platforms. The latest version is ``The Next
Tetris,'' which has been released for Sony PlayStation. With ``The
Next Tetris,'' you can play against friends, play in 3-D and play
through a controller.
</P>
<P>
   Online
</P>
<P>
   There's so much going on with Apple these days it's hard to keep
up. A great site to keep track of all the changes and upcoming
products is Apple Insider.
</P>
<P>
   This site features extensive behind-the-scenes coverage of
things such as Apple's next version of the Mac operating system,
code-named Sonata. There's also information about the Mac portable
expected to be released at MacWorld in New York this week. You'll
find Apple Insider at www.appleinsider.com/.

 &HT;    Check injury risk before you play
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Thinking about taking up inline skating, but you're
not sure about how big a role crutches might play in your future? A
Web site, www.sportscover.com
</P>
<P>
   /injcalc.htm, can take away some of the guesswork.
</P>
<P>
   The sports injury calculator is divided by type of activity _
archery to weightlifting _ and age range, gender and fitness level.
</P>
<P>
   A reasonably fit male 30 to 39 years old, for example, has a 7.5
percent chance of hurting himself playing croquet. The same man
playing rugby will get hurt 75 percent of the time, according to
the calculator, which is to be used as a guide.
</P>
<P>
   A similarly aged female is a safer bet for most sports. A fit
woman playing croquet at the same age as the fit man has a 6
percent chance of injury. The female rugby participant is a 60
percent bet for the emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   The site is a free service from Sportscover, a sports insurance
information Web site.

   Hiking guide company puts Appalachian Trail on CD
</P>
<P>
   A New Hampshire company has developed a topographic map of the
Appalachian Trail, stored on CD.
</P>
<P>
   Maptech sells CD-ROM hiking guides. The Appalachian Trail CD,
which will be released in August, covers the full 2,160 miles, from
Georgia's Springer Mountain to Mount Katahdin in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   It shows topographic maps, which tell you where the land is
relative to sea level. The disc also includes trail descriptions
and navigation software.
</P>
<P>
   The map's breadth along the trail is at least two miles and up
to eight miles. The guide contains mile-by-mile descriptions and
more than 150 photographs showing what the hikers would see as they
walk the trail.
</P>
<P>
   Also included are icons for shelters, campsites and road access
points. The navigation software lets users mark and measure
distances with a mouse click.
</P>
<P>
   The 14-state trail is divided into four discs. Each sells for
$39, so a set of four would cost $156.
</P>
<P>
   The CDs are divided into regions. The southern region includes
101 maps of Georgia, North Carolina and Tennessee. The Virginia
region has 102 maps for Virginia and West Virginia. The
Mid-Atlantic region includes 102 maps for Maryland, Pennsylvania,
New Jersey and New York. For Connecticut, Massachusetts, New
Hampshire, Vermont and Maine, 114 maps are included.
</P>
<P>
   The CDs can be ordered from Maptech, at 800-627-7236. The maps
and navigational software require at least Windows 95 and a
Pentium-class CPU, a CD-ROM, 16 megabytes of RAM and a 256-color
monitor with a mouse or another kind of drawing tool.

<P>
   Hewlett-Packard spiffs up its computer offerings
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard has taken a hint from the iMac and become a
little more provocative.
</P>
<P>
   The HP Pavilion 8000 series is Hewlett-Packard's first redesign
in two years. The most notable change is a smoke-colored
translucent panel on the front of the computer's tower.
</P>
<P>
   The series includes broadband capabilities and a keyboard geared
toward Internet navigation. Models range in price from $749 to
$1,499.
</P>
<P>
   The 8570c PC comes with an Intel Pentium III 450-megahertz
processor, 96 megabytes of RAM, a 19-gigabyte hard disk drive, a
32x CD-ROM drive and networking card, a 56K modem, and a way to
program Web sites into your keyboard for one-touch navigation. The
8570c is expected to sell for about $1,499.
</P>
<P>
   On the lower end of the price scale is the Pavilion 4540 PC,
powered by an Intel Celeron 433-megahertz processor with 64
megabytes of RAM and an 8-gigabyte hard drive. The 4540 includes a
32x CD-ROM drive, a 56K modem and a one-touch Internet keyboard. It
is expected to sell for $749.
</P>
<P>
   The HP series PCs come with 10/100BT networking cards that can
be used for high-speed Internet access through a cable modem or
digital phone line.

 &HT;    Better Homes DVD cookbook is handy, but could be better
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This week we'll examine another new cooking program _
the Ultimate DVD Cookbook from Better Homes &AMP; Gardens _ which of
course necessitates another guest appearance by my lovely and
talented wife Donna.
</P>
<P>
   After several hours of struggling with this thing, she had some
good things to say about it:
</P>
<P>
   ``I started married life 42 years ago with two cookbooks. The
first was a collection of my mother's recipes, simplified for a
daughter who had steadfastly refused to learn to cook. (Her first
observation for baking potatoes was `Wash Potato.')
</P>
<P>
   ``My second cookbook was the Better Homes &AMP; Gardens cookbook
with the familiar red-and-white plaid cover. When I opened the
computerized version, I looked for sugar cookies and chili, two
recipes I remembered fondly. The sugar cookies were gone, and the
chili was there but completely different. (I'm embarrassed to admit
that a born-and-raised Texan got her first chili recipe in what
must have been a Yankee cookbook. I assume it's a Yankee book since
the cornbread recipe has sugar in it.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The recipes are creative _ the pizza cookbook includes basic
pizza, as well as spinoffs, appetizers and desserts (candy bar
pizza sundae).
</P>
<P>
   ``The All About Cooking section is particularly useful. It tells
you what you need to know about everything from abalone to
zwieback. For example, the program defines zucchini, tells you how
to choose a good one, how to store it, how to cook it, and what
nutrients you'll get when you eat it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tips section was also useful. To make sure you get
adequate protein, the vegetarian cookbook recommends combining
grains and legumes, legumes and seeds, or grains and dairy. It also
suggests how to use tofu.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nutrition analysis is available for every ingredient from
alfalfa sprouts to yogurt, plain and nonfat. Most recipes _ but not
all _ include nutritional analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ingredient Equivalent section is useful. I didn't know
that two whole chicken breasts equal 1 1/2 pounds chicken or 2 cups
chopped chicken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite some good features, however, I can't recommend this
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better Homes has, basically, taken 10 separate programs and
tossed them onto this DVD. Each is a separate entity, and they
don't all work the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some parts don't work at all. The DVD offers video, but
doesn't run it. One of the 10 cookbooks refuses to cough up its
help section, insisting that it's already open. There is no way to
run a nutritional analysis of your own recipes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sierra's Mastercook Suite, reviewed last week, is far
superior.''

 &HT;    Catalog your needs, then spend carefully on a computer
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Once upon a time, it was easy to give advice about
buying a computer. All machines were pretty much the same, and the
conventional wisdom was to buy as much computer as you could
reasonably afford.
</P>
<P>
   It was good advice in its day. But over the past couple of
years, a lot of things have changed to make that advice outdated.
In the past, almost everyone except scientists and engineers did
the same basic tasks with a computer: word processing, e-mail,
finances and an occasional game. Those were the days of one
computer fits all _ think of it as the Model T era of computing.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays there's a definite class system in computing. Some
people do little more than e-mail, Web surfing and letter writing
with a computer. Others are true power users, manipulating graphics
from digital cameras, editing videos or even playing games.
</P>
<P>
   There's a second factor, too. A few years ago, prices were
basically the same for similarly equipped machines. Sure there's
always been the brand-name factor _ just as with cars, you pay
extra for a good brand name. But the price spread was relatively
small compared to today.
</P>
<P>
   That gives you more choices to make when it comes to buying a
computer. Since the question I am asked most frequently is what
computer to buy, here's my most current computer buying advice:
</P>
<P>
   First, decide what you plan to do with the computer.
</P>
<P>
   If all you need is a way to log on to the Internet and write the
occasional letter, consider a relatively low-end machine. Even a PC
powered by an Intel Celeron (the junior-grade Pentium chip) that
runs at 333 megahertz will do nicely for those uses. If you're
adventurous, try one of the no-brand computers that sell for as
little as $500 without the monitor. Or get a brand-name machine for
more _ but you'll still pay less than $1,000. Then spend the money
you saved on a high-speed Internet connection like a cable modem,
or DSL, from the phone company. If the Web is your main interest,
you'll get a lot more satisfaction with a low-end machine and a
high-speed connection than with a high-priced computer and a
regular telephone modem. The biggest factor when it comes to Net
performance is the speed of your connection.
</P>
<P>
   But there's another group of computer users who are more
ambitious. They care about the Internet but also want to edit
images from their digital cameras, run complicated databases and
play a game or two.
</P>
<P>
   These folks probably need more computer, but they still don't
need a Cadillac. Look for a 400- or 450-megahertz PC. Since games
are of some importance, consider a 3-D video card. It's required by
some games, and even when it is not, it makes a difference. You'll
probably be OK without spending extra on a better sound system if
games are just a minor factor. If you go the no-brand route, you
can still get a machine, less monitor, for $800 or so (but even
with a brand name such as Dell, you can get a 450-megahertz system
with 17-inch monitor for about $1,500).
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there are those folks who either need or want the top
of the line. There's nothing wrong with that. And with serious game
players, for instance, these systems can make sense _ especially if
you aren't making financial sacrifices to buy them.
</P>
<P>
   For around $2,000 you can get a 550-megahertz Pentium III
machine that's loaded with 128 megabytes of RAM, a 3-D video card,
17-inch monitor, great sound card and speakers with a subwoofer.
That's for a brand-name machine. If you shop around for a no-name
brand, you can beat that price (although if you want a
king-of-the-hill machine, there's a good argument for spending the
money for a brand name).

 &HT;    Having your computer fixed can be a nightmarish experience
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ In January, a local consultant's personal
computer crashed, and he took it to the repair counter at an
electronics store.
</P>
<P>
   After 64 days and a dozen conflicting excuses, Ted Fowler, the
consultant, finally got his computer back and it still didn't work
properly.
</P>
<P>
   Though Fowler's experience was extreme, he, unfortunately, is
not alone.
</P>
<P>
   Computers are complex machines, and most home users have only a
foggy idea of their internal workings.
</P>
<P>
   And let's face it: Computers can develop glitches faster than
adolescents develop zits.
</P>
<P>
   So if you're a home computer user, chances are good your machine
is going to need to be repaired at some point.
</P>
<P>
   Tales of woe
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton Daily News recently asked readers to call and write
about their computer repair experiences, and a few were satisfied
with the service they had received.
</P>
<P>
   But others had real horror stories, and the primary complaint
from disgruntled customers was the way computer repair technicians
and businesses treated them.
</P>
<P>
   They said technicians were flippant, condescending, deceitful
and incompetent. The repair people tended to treat customers as
annoyances rather than as the source of their livelihoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed to me they couldn't care less whether it was done
when they said it would be done,'' said Doug Berger of suburban
Dayton, who took a computer to a Miamisburg, Ohio, repair shop.
``The second time I called them to find out what was going on with
my machine, they wouldn't tell me a thing. All they would say was
they would call me when they were finished.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger has had several bad experiences with computer repair. He
said this past spring he started having trouble with his Web
browser disappearing from the screen while he was online.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made seven different calls to America Online,'' he said. ``I
got seven different technicians who gave me seven different reasons
for my problem. None of them helped.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger eventually took his computer to the small shop. After
several broken promises from the shop, Berger said finally got a
working machine back.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Fowler was not so lucky. Fowler is the managing principal of
a consulting firm that works in value analysis, and his computer
crashed after becoming infected with a virus in January.
</P>
<P>
   He took it to the repair department at a Best Buy store Jan. 26,
explained the problem and was charged about $400 for a repair.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later he called the store and spent seven minutes on
the phone before reaching the technician who took his repair order.
Fowler said the technician told him, ``I have been busy on the
counter. I haven't had time to look at your computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Fowler said at this point he began to get irritated and started
taking notes on his exchanges with Best Buy. The notes were later
used to write a 12-page affidavit he sent to Best Buy executives.
</P>
<P>
   According to the affidavit, his computer was shipped back and
forth from Trotwood, Ohio, to a repair center in Cleveland for two
months before he finally got it back along with an additional bill
of $82. In the meantime, he talked to Best Buy officials more than
30 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lying and incompetence and not caring about the customer
were just amazing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Best Buy said the computer was finished, Fowler said
he continued to get error messages every time he turned it on.
</P>
<P>
   He took it to another shop, A.C.E. Computer Helpers and a
technician there discovered what he said were major errors made by
Best Buy. It cost Fowler another $260, but now he says his machine
works perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler said after he sent his affidavit to the Chief Executive
Officer of Best Buy, the company sent him a gift certificate for
$100.
</P>
<P>
   Joy Harris, a spokesperson for Best Buy, said Fowler's case was
``unfortunate and very unusual,'' but she said Best Buy has had
problems with equipment being in the repair loop too long. She said
repairs lasting 20 days were not unusual, but the company has made
improvements lately.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said Best Buy has instituted a program that will try to
ensure that computer will be repaired within five days.
</P>
<P>
   Good experiences
</P>
<P>
   Not every customer who needs a computer repair walks into a
quagmire.
</P>
<P>
   Leroy Van Allen of Sidney, Ohio, for example, bought a computer
at Stillwater Microsystems in Piqua, Ohio, in December 1997 and
says he's had excellent service.
</P>
<P>
   A week after Van Allen bough the computer, he purchased a
program that refused to install, an infuriating situation many
users have faced.
</P>
<P>
   He took the computer back to the dealer, and technicians there
downloaded a program patch from the Internet and installed it on
computer while he waited. Van Allen didn't have Internet access at
the time, and the company also downloaded the latest video card
driver and installed it at no charge.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the experience of the readers interviewed for this
article, there seems to be two keys to having a good computer
repair experience.
</P>
<P>
   The first key is learning as much as possible about your own
machine and doing as much trouble-shooting as possible without
taking the computer to a repair shop.
</P>
<P>
   The second key is choosing a repair technician carefully. You
should know specifically who is working on your machine and if that
technician fails in some way, find another.
</P>
<P>
   Glenna Cooper of Miamisburg is a good example of the value of
understanding computers. She bought her first computer in 1986 and
discovered when she turned it on that it had no operating programs
at all.
</P>
<P>
   Using manuals and books she bought she gradually learned to
write her own programs. Now Cooper's family has three computers and
a laptop at home. ``Any time the kids or my husband crashed the
computer, I just simply fixed it very easily,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The most important accessories home computer users own are the
manuals that came with their system and software. Never throw away
a manual, and always reread the relevant sections when a problem
crops up.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, every time you buy a new program or accessory, you
must immediately register the purchase with the manufacturer. Most
manufacturers offer telephone or online assistance for their
customers, but you usually have to register to qualify for help.
</P>
<P>
   When you call for help be prepared to explain the exact
circumstances of your problem. What goes wrong and what seems to
cause it? Also print out or jot down any error messages that pop up
when the problem occurs.
</P>
<P>
   Hold on to all your receipts and warranty documents. If a
product is faulty, it's better to have the manufacturer pay for the
repair if possible.
</P>
<P>
   It also pays to be connected to the Internet. Because computer
software and hardware are made by so many different companies and
their configurations change constantly, you may have to download
upgrades and patches to make the products you buy work together.
</P>
<P>
   You also should be careful when you buy software and
accessories. Read the packages thoroughly to be sure the purchases
are compatible with your computer.
</P>
<P>
   Getting help
</P>
<P>
   An alternative to knowing everything about your computer is
associating with people who do. Joining a user group is a good idea
if you often have trouble getting your computer to operate
properly.
</P>
<P>
   Mona Spurgeon, president of the Dayton Area Computer User Group,
said members regularly bring ailing computers to meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mean to brag, but we've never had anybody who had to
go outside the club for a repair,'' Spurgeon said.
</P>
<P>
   You may have noticed that many computer repair technicians are
quite young. That's probably not just a coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Shelton, director of public relations for CompUSA, said
the chain typically recruits its technicians through high
school-level vocational programs. She said the company asks
vocational school instructors for the names of outstanding
students, and the students who are hired are sent through a
five-day certification course.
</P>
<P>
   Each company is different, however.
</P>
<P>
   Computer Edge in Dayton, for example, is basically a one-man
operation run by owner David Horn.
</P>
<P>
   Horn has only run his repair and sales company for about 18
months, but he's been involved with computers for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a lot of business through word of mouth,'' Horn said.
``Some consumers may be apprehensive to turn their computers over
to kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Having your computer repaired can be an intimidating experience,
but you should can increase your chance at having a good experience
by doing some homework.
</P>
<P>
   Before taking your computer in for repair or summoning a repair
service to your home, quiz friends and acquaintances about their
experiences. Ask questions not only about which companies did good
work for them but also about which individual technicians they
found helpful.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid repair shops that have failed to complete work on time for
others without giving a very valid reason.
</P>
<P>
   Never leave your computer with a technician who doesn't listen
carefully to your problems. A technician should ask questions about
your experience with the machine before jumping in with proposed
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   If possible, have the technician run a quick diagnostic program
while you watch. Have the technician repeat the steps that usually
lead to the failure you want fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Get a written estimate spelling out what the problems are and
how they are to be corrected. The estimate should indicate the
company will get your authorization before exceeding the estimated
amount.
</P>
<P>
   If components are replaced, get the components that were
removed.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes your only option is to be patient; after all, no
technician can fix a computer if a needed part hasn't arrived yet.
But if a particular company makes a habit of disappointing you _
moving back the time when your computer will be ready, finding
problems they'd previously overlooked, failing to keep you
informed, etc. _ keep notes and records of your experience.
</P>
<P>
   Complain to management about a technician's poor performance and
perhaps your job will move up the priority scale a little.
</P>
<P>
   If one repair shop turns out to be hopeless, you may be better
off simply retrieving your machine. Some readers said even though
they had to pay a bad shop basically for doing nothing, it was
worth it to get their machine to a more capable technician.
</P>
<P>
   When you find a repairer who is reliable and reasonably priced
make sure every computer user you know hears about it.

 &HT;    Sites cover Fido, Fluffy and every possible pet
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's more than one way to name a cat.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a pet lover, the Web is littered with sites that can
help _ whether your pet of choice is a Chihuahua or a king snake.
Let's start with a good general purpose site called petlinks.com,
located understandably enough at www.petlinks.com/.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing you'll notice is a rather busy page filled with
text. But the absence of graphics means the page loads fast, and
the text is an elaborate system of links for almost every type of
pet you can imagine.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, if rodents are your thing, you'll appreciate the
links for rats, mice, gerbils, squirrels and chinchillas. For more
popular pets like cats or dogs, you'll find a series of links to
everything from shelters to trainers.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a nice search feature so, if you aren't sure what
category to check, you can use a search word to find your topic
fast. There's also a link for a live chat section, where you can
have typed real-time conversations with other pet fanciers.
</P>
<P>
   The next site _ called the Tame Beast _ is also a general
collection of pet links. It can be found at www
</P>
<P>
   .tamebeast.com/. The organization is a bit different here.
Instead of a list of possible pets on the starting page (and you'll
find that as well), there are links for topics such as ``working
animals,'' ``fun sites,'' ``live cam sites'' and for searching past
articles about pets.
</P>
<P>
   There's an impressive amount of information here, most of it to
be found in links to other sites outside the Tame Beast. For
instance, if you click on ``cat,'' you'll get literally hundreds of
links to other sites.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe that even the most passionate cat fancier
would have the time or the inclination to visit each of the sites.
But since there's a capsule summary of each site, you can winnow
down the list to just the sites with the information you want.
</P>
<P>
   Our next stop is a commercial site sponsored by Ralston-Purina.
You'll find it at petquarters.petkare.com/.
</P>
<P>
   This site focuses strongly on cats and dogs. Since those two
animals make up most of this country's pet population, the site
will appeal to many. The good features here include meaty sections
on choosing a veterinarian, essays on basic care for dogs and cats,
a pet column and _ as you'd expect from a pet food company _ lots
of data about nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   While you need to keep in mind that this is sponsored by a
company that would love to sell pet food to you, the nutrition
information is in-depth and seems unbiased. You'll learn about
special diets for cats with urinary tract problems and ways to keep
an older animal healthy.
</P>
<P>
   One of the places where the Ralston-Purina connection helps is
in a section that explains the ins and outs of reading the label on
a pet food can. There's an amazing amount of information to be
mined there.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, let's go back to that notion that there's more than one
way to name a cat.
</P>
<P>
   If that's what you have in mind, take a look at a site called
2000 cat names. It borrows a theme from several sites that offer a
list of names for new babies. It can be located at www.petrix.com
</P>
<P>
   /catnames/.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the names are fairly strange _ Jabberwocky and J. Edgar,
for instance _ but then so are cats.

 &HT;    Speakers out of sight, out of mind
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ If you want to hide the speakers for your high
fidelity sound system so they blend perfectly with the decor of
your rooms, you basically have to cut into walls and ceilings to
install recessed speakers and the wiring to connect them.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're willing to have the speakers minimally visible,
you can choose a flat panel speaker that hangs on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Infinity Systems Inc., part of the Harman Consumer Group of
audiovisual products, offers a full-performance speaker only 1 1/2
inches deep. The FPS-100 Flat Panel Loudspeaker measures just over
25 inches high and just under 12 inches wide and is designed to
hang on a wall in about the same space a framed painting might
occupy.
</P>
<P>
   According to a press release from Infinity, the FPS-1000 uses a
slim-profile, advanced technology 5-inch woofer with a 5-inch
passive radiator and a 1-inch-high performance tweeter. The tweeter
can be rotated to direct sound to anywhere in the room.
</P>
<P>
   The speakers have a suggested retail price of $599 a pair and
come with 40 feet of flat speaker wire.
</P>
<P>
   You can log on to www.infinitysystems.com and click on the
``On-line shopping'' icon at the bottom of the home page. That will
link you to several dealers who sell Infinity products via the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you're just interested in flat speakers, you don't
necessarily have to go with the FPS-1000 model. Check middle- and
high-end audio dealers for their offerings in slim line sound
equipment.

 &HT;    Web isn't interwoven with much of the world
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The typical Internet user worldwide is male, under 35
years old, with a university education and high income, urban-based
and English speaking.
</P>
<P>
   This profile of the average Web surfer comes from the
just-published ``Human Development Report 1999,'' commissioned by
the United Nations Development Program. The 260-page study touched
on a variety of issues concerning the worldwide distribution of
wealth and technology. It concluded that while technological
advances may be improving life for many, it's also widening the gap
between rich and poor.
</P>
<P>
   North America, with less than 5 percent of the population, has
more computers than the rest of the world combined. South Asia,
with 23 percent of the world's people, has less than 1 percent of
the world's Internet users. The study also reports that 80 percent
of all Web sites are in English, which is spoken by less than 10
percent of the world's population.
</P>
<P>
   The study also noted that Internet connections cost an average
of about $10 a month for Americans but can cost upward of $100 in
Africa. A computer costs the average American one month's pay but
would cost the average Bangladeshi eight years' income.
</P>
<P>
   Even if it were possible to wire developing countries quickly
and inexpensively, people in those countries without basic computer
skills would still have little access to electronic commerce. Nor
would they have access to any of the basic functions such as
sending e-mail or access to educational opportunities available via
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The study has some solutions for leveling out the worldwide
inequalities, including a possible ``bit tax'' on e-mail that has
sent editorial page editors from Canada to Canberra into a frenzy
that should keep them going for months.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of information is troubling, partially because there
is not a lot average citizens can do about it _ except feel vaguely
guilty that they aren't doing something about it. There are some
people, such as Intel's PC Dads, who travel the country teaching
parents and educators computer basics, and Richard Kenyada of
Decatur, who works on his own time to bring computers and know-how
into the African-American community.
</P>
<P>
   Still, nearly everyone working to increase computer access and
raise computer literacy levels will tell you that bridging the
digital divide in the United States is hard enough without
literally throwing the weight of the world's problems onto the pile
as well.
</P>
<P>
   There are things we do almost without thinking in the United
States that are not possible in many parts of the world. Every day,
millions of Americans are trading stocks, uploading photos of the
grandchildren, reading articles from Salon or buying Bruce
Springsteen music at CDNow.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen million people have access to America Online and pay
only $21.95 a month, which many argue is way too much.
Mademoiselle, a women's magazine targeted at twentysomething
working women, features Web addresses at the end of every story.
During the Super Bowl, lingerie maker Victoria's Secret put its Web
address in a 30-second TV ad, and millions of Americans (presumably
the under-35 white males the study mentions) dashed to their
computers to check it out. There are very few places in the world,
the study says, where a great portion of the population has not
only the skills but the resources to do such things.
</P>
<P>
   Many people may remember being told as children to eat
everything on their dinner plates because children are starving in
India. Lots of kids wondered how eating all of mom's meatloaf would
make life better for a starving 8-year-old in Calcutta. The answer
is simple: It doesn't. The point of even being asked to clean your
plate was to make you realize how lucky you were to have a full
plate of food in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   So the next time you're out pricing computers at the mall or at
home online getting slightly miffed because the Ticketmaster Web
site is down, remember what we think of as an absolute necessity is
still a remote, almost incomprehensible dream for most of the
world's population.

 &HT;    Wired lends an ear to music revolution
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's a revolution under way in how people will be
able to buy and receive music and videos. Of course, it involves
the Net. Read all about the coming change in the August issue of
Wired. The magazine features a series of stories about new digital
distribution technology, including MP3. Wired's article includes a
fun chart depicting the new technology and how it works.
</P>
<P>
   Treat your PC like a sports car. That's the advice in the August
issue of PC World magazine. It features a series of articles that
show you how to tune, fix up and boost the power of most PCs. These
articles will show you how to tell if your PC is on the blink and,
even if it's working fine, how to make it more powerful.
</P>
<P>
   The same issue of PC World also has an interesting piece
reviewing the new PalmPilot VII. This is the model that introduced
wireless communications to the hand-held computing world. You can
use the PalmPilot VII to send and receive e-mail and visit a
limited number of Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   ``Links Extreme,'' a new Microsoft release, features a novel
twist on golf simulation CDs. In the game, you can play on a
demolition driving range where the golf balls will explode. Another
course offers a 100-foot skeleton as a practice target. You get the
idea. The game contains mild animated violence. It's available only
for PCs with Windows 95 or higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tetris'' was one of the original games for Nintendo's GameBoy.
It's changed over the years, adding cool graphics and colors and
migrating to other game platforms. The latest version is ``The Next
Tetris,'' which has been released for Sony PlayStation. With ``The
Next Tetris,'' you can play against friends, play in 3-D and play
through a controller.
</P>
<P>
   Online
</P>
<P>
   There's so much going on with Apple these days it's hard to keep
up. A great site to keep track of all the changes and upcoming
products is Apple Insider.
</P>
<P>
   This site features extensive behind-the-scenes coverage of
things such as Apple's next version of the Mac operating system,
code-named Sonata. There's also information about the Mac portable
expected to be released at MacWorld in New York this week. You'll
find Apple Insider at www.appleinsider.com/.

 &HT;    Check injury risk before you play
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Thinking about taking up inline skating, but you're
not sure about how big a role crutches might play in your future? A
Web site, www.sportscover.com
</P>
<P>
   /injcalc.htm, can take away some of the guesswork.
</P>
<P>
   The sports injury calculator is divided by type of activity _
archery to weightlifting _ and age range, gender and fitness level.
</P>
<P>
   A reasonably fit male 30 to 39 years old, for example, has a 7.5
percent chance of hurting himself playing croquet. The same man
playing rugby will get hurt 75 percent of the time, according to
the calculator, which is to be used as a guide.
</P>
<P>
   A similarly aged female is a safer bet for most sports. A fit
woman playing croquet at the same age as the fit man has a 6
percent chance of injury. The female rugby participant is a 60
percent bet for the emergency room.
</P>

   The site is a free service from Sportscover, a sports insurance
information Web site.

   Hiking guide company puts Appalachian Trail on CD
</P>
<P>
   A New Hampshire company has developed a topographic map of the
Appalachian Trail, stored on CD.
</P>
<P>
   Maptech sells CD-ROM hiking guides. The Appalachian Trail CD,
which will be released in August, covers the full 2,160 miles, from
Georgia's Springer Mountain to Mount Katahdin in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   It shows topographic maps, which tell you where the land is
relative to sea level. The disc also includes trail descriptions
and navigation software.
</P>
<P>
   The map's breadth along the trail is at least two miles and up
to eight miles. The guide contains mile-by-mile descriptions and
more than 150 photographs showing what the hikers would see as they
walk the trail.
</P>
<P>
   Also included are icons for shelters, campsites and road access
points. The navigation software lets users mark and measure
distances with a mouse click.
</P>
<P>
   The 14-state trail is divided into four discs. Each sells for
$39, so a set of four would cost $156.
</P>
<P>
   The CDs are divided into regions. The southern region includes
101 maps of Georgia, North Carolina and Tennessee. The Virginia
region has 102 maps for Virginia and West Virginia. The
Mid-Atlantic region includes 102 maps for Maryland, Pennsylvania,
New Jersey and New York. For Connecticut, Massachusetts, New
Hampshire, Vermont and Maine, 114 maps are included.
</P>
<P>
   The CDs can be ordered from Maptech, at 800-627-7236. The maps
and navigational software require at least Windows 95 and a
Pentium-class CPU, a CD-ROM, 16 megabytes of RAM and a 256-color
monitor with a mouse or another kind of drawing tool.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard spiffs up its computer offerings
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard has taken a hint from the iMac and become a
little more provocative.
</P>
<P>
   The HP Pavilion 8000 series is Hewlett-Packard's first redesign
in two years. The most notable change is a smoke-colored
translucent panel on the front of the computer's tower.
</P>
<P>
   The series includes broadband capabilities and a keyboard geared
toward Internet navigation. Models range in price from $749 to
$1,499.
</P>
<P>
   The 8570c PC comes with an Intel Pentium III 450-megahertz
processor, 96 megabytes of RAM, a 19-gigabyte hard disk drive, a
32x CD-ROM drive and networking card, a 56K modem, and a way to
program Web sites into your keyboard for one-touch navigation. The
8570c is expected to sell for about $1,499.
</P>
<P>
   On the lower end of the price scale is the Pavilion 4540 PC,
powered by an Intel Celeron 433-megahertz processor with 64
megabytes of RAM and an 8-gigabyte hard drive. The 4540 includes a
32x CD-ROM drive, a 56K modem and a one-touch Internet keyboard. It
is expected to sell for $749.
</P>
<P>
   The HP series PCs come with 10/100BT networking cards that can
be used for high-speed Internet access through a cable modem or
digital phone line.

 &HT;    Catalog your needs, then spend carefully on a computer
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Once upon a time, it was easy to give advice about
buying a computer. All machines were pretty much the same, and the
conventional wisdom was to buy as much computer as you could
reasonably afford.
</P>
<P>
   It was good advice in its day. But over the past couple of
years, a lot of things have changed to make that advice outdated.
In the past, almost everyone except scientists and engineers did
the same basic tasks with a computer: word processing, e-mail,
finances and an occasional game. Those were the days of one
computer fits all _ think of it as the Model T era of computing.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays there's a definite class system in computing. Some
people do little more than e-mail, Web surfing and letter writing
with a computer. Others are true power users, manipulating graphics
from digital cameras, editing videos or even playing games.
</P>
<P>
   There's a second factor, too. A few years ago, prices were
basically the same for similarly equipped machines. Sure there's
always been the brand-name factor _ just as with cars, you pay
extra for a good brand name. But the price spread was relatively
small compared to today.
</P>
<P>
   That gives you more choices to make when it comes to buying a
computer. Since the question I am asked most frequently is what
computer to buy, here's my most current computer buying advice:
</P>
<P>
   First, decide what you plan to do with the computer.
</P>
<P>
   If all you need is a way to log on to the Internet and write the
occasional letter, consider a relatively low-end machine. Even a PC
powered by an Intel Celeron (the junior-grade Pentium chip) that
runs at 333 megahertz will do nicely for those uses. If you're
adventurous, try one of the no-brand computers that sell for as
little as $500 without the monitor. Or get a brand-name machine for
more _ but you'll still pay less than $1,000. Then spend the money
you saved on a high-speed Internet connection like a cable modem,
or DSL, from the phone company. If the Web is your main interest,
you'll get a lot more satisfaction with a low-end machine and a
high-speed connection than with a high-priced computer and a
regular telephone modem. The biggest factor when it comes to Net
performance is the speed of your connection.
</P>
<P>
   But there's another group of computer users who are more
ambitious. They care about the Internet but also want to edit
images from their digital cameras, run complicated databases and
play a game or two.
</P>
<P>
   These folks probably need more computer, but they still don't
need a Cadillac. Look for a 400- or 450-megahertz PC. Since games
are of some importance, consider a 3-D video card. It's required by
some games, and even when it is not, it makes a difference. You'll
probably be OK without spending extra on a better sound system if
games are just a minor factor. If you go the no-brand route, you
can still get a machine, less monitor, for $800 or so (but even
with a brand name such as Dell, you can get a 450-megahertz system
with 17-inch monitor for about $1,500).
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there are those folks who either need or want the top
of the line. There's nothing wrong with that. And with serious game
players, for instance, these systems can make sense _ especially if
you aren't making financial sacrifices to buy them.
</P>
<P>
   For around $2,000 you can get a 550-megahertz Pentium III
machine that's loaded with 128 megabytes of RAM, a 3-D video card,
17-inch monitor, great sound card and speakers with a subwoofer.
That's for a brand-name machine. If you shop around for a no-name
brand, you can beat that price (although if you want a
king-of-the-hill machine, there's a good argument for spending the
money for a brand name).

   ATLANTA _ Move over, Kermit! Gonzo is the star of ``Muppets From
Space,'' which opened July 14 and is rated G.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzo wants to know where he came from. Everyone has somebody
that looks like him or her _ except for Gonzo. He dreams of meeting
his family.
</P>
<P>
   The Muppet gang, especially Rizzo, thinks Gonzo is going nuts.
Rizzo, the rat from ``Muppet Treasure Island,'' is Gonzo's best
friend and roommate. He has lots of funny lines.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzo receives messages from space. He decides to try to
communicate with who he thinks is his family. Miss Piggy is working
at a TV station, which has a space show, and she wants to be the
star.
</P>
<P>
   The adventure starts when the Muppet gang has to help their
friend. They want to believe what he's telling them about his
family.
</P>
<P>
   The music is great and funky and begins with ``Brick House'' and
Miss Piggy.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of old characters are in this movie, such as Animal, Rolf,
Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and Beaker. We liked this movie and hope you
will, too!

 &HT;    There is still plenty to learn about the moon
 &HT;    By J. Matthew Aldag
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Three decades ago, Americans were glued to their
televisions as Neil Armstrong took the first human step onto a
world other than our own and uttered the famous words: ``That's one
small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.''
</P>
<P>
   The Apollo 11 mission celebrates its 30th anniversary on July 20
and the United States plans to return to the moon on a new mission
at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   Apollo 11 was a comeback victory for the American space program.
During the Cold War, the United States was in a race with the
Communist Soviet Union to be the first in space exploration. The
two nations wanted to be in space for national security, for
scientific research and for national pride.
</P>
<P>
   The United States started the race as No. 2. The Soviet Union
launched the first space satellite, Sputnik I, on Oct. 4, 1957. A
month later, Sputnik 2 returned a dog named Laika safely from the
Earth's orbit. Then in 1961, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became
the first human to fly in outer space with a 108-minute orbit above
the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The United States created the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration in 1958. NASA went on to hurdle the great challenges
of space exploration, but after its Communist counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Shepard became the first American in space a month after
Gagarin with a 15-minute flight 115 miles above the Earth. John
Glenn became the first American to achieve Earth orbit. He
completely circled the planet in space on Feb. 20, 1962. Last
October, Glenn, 77, went to space again _ this time aboard the
space shuttle Discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Soviets were the first to land an unmanned lunar
probe and were the first to take pictures of the far side of the
moon, NASA edged out its competition. The Apollo 11 moon landing is
hailed as one of the greatest feats in space exploration, marking
the first footprints on a world other than ours.
</P>
<P>
   What do the moon and insanity have in common?
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of years ago, doctors were convinced that a full moon
could cause people to go mad. Hence the word lunatic, derived from
``luna'' _ the Latin word for moon.
</P>
<P>
   Another ancient myth was ``lycanthropy,'' the power to be
transformed into deadly creatures at a full moon. (Think
werewolves.)
</P>
<P>
   NASA projects like the Apollo 11 mission have dispelled the
mythology about the Earth's only natural satellite.
</P>
<P>
   But even when Apollo 11 astronauts Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and
Michael Collins returned from their mission in 1969, scientists
still harbored fears. The three heroes were quarantined for more
than two weeks to prevent lunar contamination or viruses being
brought to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years and six successful Apollo landings later,
scientific discoveries have been made. Devoid of life, the moon has
one-sixth of Earth's gravity and is made of materials similar to
what are found on Earth. These rocks, returned by Apollo missions,
have helped scientists guess how the moon was formed. Currently,
the most widely accepted theory is that an ancient collision
between the Earth and another planet-sized object ejected debris
into orbit and that the debris collected together to form the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Some moon mystery remains. NASA's Lunar Prospector may confirm
the existence of water in a giant, shadowy crater on the moon's
south pole when it smashes into the surface later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Moon missions also gave the world a new appreciation of our
planet.
</P>
<P>
   NASA historian Roger Launius said one of the most important

   ATLANTA _Can chemistry shrink computers?
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have developed a process that could lead to computer
parts as thin as a single molecule. This is an important step
toward the creation of new, ultrafast machines.
</P>
<P>
   The team from the Hewlett-Packard Co. and the University of
California at Los Angeles say their work could lead to computers
100 billion times faster than today's most powerful personal
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, integrated circuits _ the on-off switches that are
the basis for computing _ have been made by etching silicon wafers
with beams of light.
</P>
<P>
   But the researchers say they found a way to construct the
circuits using a chemical process, making the switches as small as
a molecule. Scientists say the technology might eventually
replicate the power of 100 computer work stations in a space the
size of a grain of salt.
</P>
<P>
   Umps may walk out
</P>
<P>
   Major-league umpires are expected to quit Sept. 2, and
minor-league umpires might not be there to fill in.
</P>
<P>
   Major-league umpires have been angry since player Roberto Alomar
spat at an umpire three years ago and was suspended for five games,
a punishment they felt was too lenient. Tensions rose even higher
this month when the National League suspended an ump for three days
for bumping a player.
</P>
<P>
   Most umpires have agreed to resign in protest. If they do quit 4
1/2 weeks before the end of the regular season, owners could hire
umpires from minor leagues, high schools and colleges.
</P>
<P>
   But now, minor-league umps are threatening to go on strike at
the same time for better conditions.
</P>
<P>
   SATs lost by Fed Ex
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of students in California must retake their
college-entrance exams. Federal Express lost 695 students'
Scholastic Assessment Tests, which are necessary at most colleges
for admission.
</P>
<P>
   Students from schools in Torrance and Gardena took the test on
June 5. But all the SATs disappeared on the way to the New Jersey
headquarters of the Educational Testing Service, which conducts the
tests nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Federal Express said a test administrator
brought in the package of SATs to a local depot ``but that's the
last anyone has seen of it.'' Students can retake the test for free
later this summer.

 &HT;    Better Homes DVD cookbook is handy, but could be better
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This week we'll examine another new cooking program _
the Ultimate DVD Cookbook from Better Homes &AMP; Gardens _ which of
course necessitates another guest appearance by my lovely and
talented wife Donna.
</P>
<P>
   After several hours of struggling with this thing, she had some
good things to say about it:
</P>
<P>
   ``I started married life 42 years ago with two cookbooks. The
first was a collection of my mother's recipes, simplified for a
daughter who had steadfastly refused to learn to cook. (Her first
observation for baking potatoes was `Wash Potato.')
</P>
<P>
   ``My second cookbook was the Better Homes &AMP; Gardens cookbook
with the familiar red-and-white plaid cover. When I opened the
computerized version, I looked for sugar cookies and chili, two
recipes I remembered fondly. The sugar cookies were gone, and the
chili was there but completely different. (I'm embarrassed to admit
that a born-and-raised Texan got her first chili recipe in what
must have been a Yankee cookbook. I assume it's a Yankee book since
the cornbread recipe has sugar in it.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The recipes are creative _ the pizza cookbook includes basic
pizza, as well as spinoffs, appetizers and desserts (candy bar
pizza sundae).
</P>
<P>
   ``The All About Cooking section is particularly useful. It tells
you what you need to know about everything from abalone to
zwieback. For example, the program defines zucchini, tells you how
to choose a good one, how to store it, how to cook it, and what
nutrients you'll get when you eat it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tips section was also useful. To make sure you get
adequate protein, the vegetarian cookbook recommends combining
grains and legumes, legumes and seeds, or grains and dairy. It also
suggests how to use tofu.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nutrition analysis is available for every ingredient from
alfalfa sprouts to yogurt, plain and nonfat. Most recipes _ but not
all _ include nutritional analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ingredient Equivalent section is useful. I didn't know
that two whole chicken breasts equal 1 1/2 pounds chicken or 2 cups
chopped chicken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite some good features, however, I can't recommend this
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better Homes has, basically, taken 10 separate programs and
tossed them onto this DVD. Each is a separate entity, and they
don't all work the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some parts don't work at all. The DVD offers video, but
doesn't run it. One of the 10 cookbooks refuses to cough up its
help section, insisting that it's already open. There is no way to
run a nutritional analysis of your own recipes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sierra's Mastercook Suite, reviewed last week, is far
superior.''

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane S. Greig
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas Q: What is a ``Cotton-eyed Joe''? I am not talking
about the dance or the song. In the song ``Harbor Lights,'' there
are harbor lights, in ``Harvest Moon'' there is a harvest moon, so
what is a ``Cotton-eyed Joe''?
</P>
<P>
   _ Roy McCoy
</P>
<P>
   A:A person. The phrase cotton-eyed was used to describe folks
who had a condition that made their entire eye appear milky or
white, according to Dr. Francis Abernethy of the Texas Folklore
Society
</P>
<P>
   Retinal surgeon Dr. Armie Harper says the white appearance may
have been caused by cataracts or perhaps a corneal scar. However,
it was probably pterygium, a condition affecting those who worked
outside _ farmers, field hands, etc. Pterygium, caused by
overexposure to the sun and wind, covers the eyes in reddish-white
film.
</P>
<P>
   Q:I would like to know the dimensions of the luggage allowed as
a carry-on. I know there is a certain limit at check-in.
</P>
<P>
   A: The suggested size is 9 by 13 by 23 inches to fit under the
seat or in the overhead compartment, but the rule is a combined
size of 45 inches (height, width and length),says American
Airlines, whose weight limit is 70 pounds per bag. Weight limits
vary by carrier. (Hey, if you can't lift it, maybe you shouldn't be
carrying it on the plane). The limit of two carry-ons per passenger
does not include normal-size purses, coats or assistive items that
assist those with for those with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Grouse about passengers who with carry-onsluggage? Remember: The
practice allows baggage handlers to move checked luggage quicker.
</P>
<P>
   Q:I've finally found a solution for the mosquitoes that bother
us in our baby wading pool outside _ citronella tiki torches. But
now, I'm wondering if all the black smoke they put out is dangerous
for my baby.
</P>
<P>
   _ B. Rowan
</P>
<P>
   A:The Central Texas Poison Center says the smoke may irritate
eyes, but is not toxic. For safety, keep the center's number handy
_ (800) 764-7661.Any burning will produce carbon monoxide_ not a
problem unless person has previous respiratory disorders
</P>
<P>
   Q:Can an old microwave (I'm talking real old _ maybe 15 years)
leak radiation? How can one find out if an old microwave is safe?
</P>
<P>
   _ B. Rowan
</P>
<P>
   A:Yes, a microwave can leak, but unless the door is visibly
damaged (cracked, bent, closing poorly) you do not need to have it
tested, advises Harry Rubbright at the Microwave Research Center.
Professional testing is the only reliable testing kind, and it's is
expensive ($100 in the neighborhood of $100). Suspect a problem
with your microwave? Might as well buy a new microwave as have it
tested.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am planning to start my DVD collection soon, but am curious
on whether or not I will be able to order discs from the United
Kingdom and play them on my DVD player stateside. I found out the
hard way that movies bought in Great Britain they cannot be played
on VHS players here and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nolan E. Turner
</P>
<P>
   A:Luckily most DVD, or digital versatile disks, covers are
marked Region 1 (Canada, the United States, U.S., U.S. Territories)
or All (all regions).
</P>
<P>
   Other regional coding: includes 2: Japan, Europe, South Africa,
Middle East (including Egypt),; 3: Southeast Asia, East Asia
(including Hong Kong),; 4: Australia, New Zealand, Pacific Islands,
Central America, Mexico, South America, Caribbean,; 5: Former
Soviet Union, Indian Subcontinent, Africa (also North Korea,
Mongolia),; 6: China,; 7: Reserved,; 8: Special international
venues (airplanes, cruise ships, etc.)
</P>
<P>
   There are codeless DVDs as well. And audio DVDs don't have
regional codes. Some DVD players may be modified to play all coded
DVDs. I am still struggling with compact disks.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What constitutes a rack of lamb when listed on a menu in a
restaurant? A friend and I were in a somewhat upscale restaurant in
Toronto where we ordered a ``rack of lamb'' for about C$35
(Canadian). We expected to see a ``rack'' (i.e. a quantity we could
share) and instead got two little lamb chops on a small pile of
shredded veggies. Were we ripped off?
</P>
<P>
   _ M. Meredith
</P>
<P>
   A:''Yes, you were,'' says Four Seasons executive chef Elmar
Prambs. The full rack of lamb is eight to nine bones, and a serving
should be at least three to four chops. A prudent diner could share
this size serving, but a lamb lover would not want to.
</P>
<P>
   When in doubt, always inquire about portions and serving size. A
good waiter will be happy to advise you.
</P>
<P>
   Q:I understood you should never be on the telephone during a
thunderstorm. I was chastised by a brother-in-law for this. He said
our lines were buried; therefore, it was not a problem. Please
clarify.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kenneth C.
</P>
<P>
   A:Odds of being struck by lightning? One in 600,000. Even buried
phone lines can carry electrical charges into your home. ZAP! Many
people have been injured, and some killed, while on telephones
during thunderstorms Make calls during an electrical storm on a
cordless telephone.

   COXNET PTECH 0720 -- The Columbine High killings have prompted

   TECH-CENTERPIECE _ COMPUTER-REPAIRS _ In January, a local
consultant's personal computer crashed, and he took it to the
repair counter at an electronics store. After 64 days and a dozen
conflicting excuses, Ted Fowler, the consultant, finally got his
computer back and it still didn't work properly. Though Fowler's
experience was extreme, he, unfortunately, is not alone. Computers
are complex machines, and most home users have only a foggy idea of
their internal workings. So if you're a home computer user, chances
are good your machine is going to need to be repaired at some
point. (Cummings, Dayton Daily News). 41.

 &HT;    Playing on fears stirs emotions and ratings
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The season of newsmagazines is upon us, bursting
with heart-pounding stories about murders, kidnappings and assorted
criminal mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   A quick sampling of 13 (yes, thirteen ) newsmagazines scattered
across the prime-time landscape recently found an amazing sameness
in content. Lots of gruesome crimes presented as mysteries,
complete with music, sound effects and melodramatic narration from
a breathless reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Ta-dummm, plink-plink ... ``Mary Lou came home to an empty
house. It was dark at the top of the stairs as she began the long
climb. Little did she know that terror awaited her (ta-dummm),
terror that would forever change her family and the quiet
neighborhood where she lived.''
</P>
<P>
   It's Hollywood-style storytelling, and similar scenarios are
playing out hour after hour this summer. Rather than turn away from
the sameness of the programs' subjects and style, viewers are
gobbling them up. In the latest Nielsen ratings, eight of the Top
20 programs were newsmagazines, with ``Dateline NBC'' at No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   But why is the content so similar and what does it say about us
that we seem to love this salacious stuff so much?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a simple reason for the sameness,'' said Andrew Kohut,
director of the Pew Research Center for People and the Press.
``There are too few major news events for all the major news
outlets. With audiences increasingly heterogeneous, there are fewer
themes that will deliver the mass audience needed for a network TV
show, so they go back to the tried and trues.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of grisly murder mysteries is certainly not relegated
to television. Mystery is a hugely popular literary genre and,
until the current obsession with gross-out comedy and science
fiction came along, was a much-used movie theme, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fear,'' said James Seguin, professor of communications at
Robert Morris College in Pittsburgh and an expert on the impact of
the media. ``These stories are looking to connect with people.
They're looking for any emotion to do that, and fear is a big one.
It's your worst nightmare when something happens out of the blue.''
</P>
<P>
   And that dark, dark pleasure called voyeurism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like walking down the street in your neighborhood and
looking through the curtains,'' Seguin said. ``We're all voyeurs to
an extent. We want to pry into other people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   A survey conducted by the Pew Research Center last year found
that viewers, especially newsmagazine viewers, like news stories
that stir them emotionally. They place a premium on accuracy and
timeliness, but more than half of them also want the subject matter
to prompt an emotional response. A ``Dateline'' or ``20/20'' story
about a psychotic killer could certainly cause the old emotional
cauldron to bubble.
</P>
<P>
   Adding production values to the mix intensifies the emotion. A
decade ago, news divisions considered journalism sacred, and no
heightened effects were allowed. But that has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beginning of the change was the success of those reality
programs, like `Unsolved Mysteries' and `Inside Edition,''' Seguin
said. ``Now I think `60 Minutes' is the only one that doesn't use
music and other sound effects. Music builds emotion, and that's
what they're trying to do. They want to make it more
entertaining.''
</P>
<P>
   With an emotional story, preferably with a victim's weeping
relative being interviewed, the camera can zoom in tight on the
weeper and then pull back to show the reporter looking deeply
concerned. It's a specific storytelling style that fits TV
newsmagazines to a T. And it obviously pulls viewers in.
</P>
<P>
   Newsmagazines are more popular in the summer mostly because all
the other prime-time programs are reruns. Although many of the
newsmagazines use stories that have aired before, the segments are
updated, and some episode even include new reports.
</P>
<P>
   Strong ratings and low production costs are the main reasons
networks love newsmagazines. NBC now has five nights of
``Dateline,'' ABC has four nights of ``20/20,'' CBS has two
editions of ``60 Minutes'' and, for the summer, two special nights
of ``48 Hours'' _ ``48 Hours Monday Mysteries'' and ``48 Hours
Tuesday Adventures.'' ABC also has introduced a short-run summer
newsmagazine called ``Vanished'' that presents cases of missing
people.
</P>
<P>
   These programs may be filled with hard-core journalism, but
they're presented in a decidedly melodramatic, tabloid style. Maybe
that's why they attract a larger, non-traditional news audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cool to be fascinated with these stories,'' Seguin said.
``Newsmagazines have a heavy teen audience. They also have a large
audience of families and singles 25-45.''
</P>
<P>
   All eager to be shaken and emotionally stirred.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane S. Greig
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas Q: What is a ``Cotton-eyed Joe''? I am not talking
about the dance or the song. In the song ``Harbor Lights,'' there
are harbor lights, in ``Harvest Moon'' there is a harvest moon, so
what is a ``Cotton-eyed Joe''?
</P>
<P>
   _ Roy McCoy
</P>
<P>
   A:A person. The phrase cotton-eyed was used to describe folks
who had a condition that made their entire eye appear milky or
white, according to Dr. Francis Abernethy of the Texas Folklore
Society
</P>
<P>
   Retinal surgeon Dr. Armie Harper says the white appearance may
have been caused by cataracts or perhaps a corneal scar. However,
it was probably pterygium, a condition affecting those who worked
outside _ farmers, field hands, etc. Pterygium, caused by
overexposure to the sun and wind, covers the eyes in reddish-white
film.
</P>
<P>
   Q:I would like to know the dimensions of the luggage allowed as
a carry-on. I know there is a certain limit at check-in.
</P>
<P>
   A: The suggested size is 9 by 13 by 23 inches to fit under the
seat or in the overhead compartment, but the rule is a combined
size of 45 inches (height, width and length),says American
Airlines, whose weight limit is 70 pounds per bag. Weight limits
vary by carrier. (Hey, if you can't lift it, maybe you shouldn't be
carrying it on the plane). The limit of two carry-ons per passenger
does not include normal-size purses, coats or assistive items that
assist those with for those with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Grouse about passengers who with carry-onsluggage? Remember: The
practice allows baggage handlers to move checked luggage quicker.
</P>
<P>
   Q:I've finally found a solution for the mosquitoes that bother
us in our baby wading pool outside _ citronella tiki torches. But
now, I'm wondering if all the black smoke they put out is dangerous
for my baby.
</P>
<P>
   _ B. Rowan
</P>
<P>
   A:The Central Texas Poison Center says the smoke may irritate
eyes, but is not toxic. For safety, keep the center's number handy
_ (800) 764-7661.Any burning will produce carbon monoxide_ not a
problem unless person has previous respiratory disorders
</P>
<P>
   Q:Can an old microwave (I'm talking real old _ maybe 15 years)
leak radiation? How can one find out if an old microwave is safe?
</P>
<P>
   _ B. Rowan
</P>
<P>
   A:Yes, a microwave can leak, but unless the door is visibly
damaged (cracked, bent, closing poorly) you do not need to have it
tested, advises Harry Rubbright at the Microwave Research Center.
Professional testing is the only reliable testing kind, and it's is
expensive ($100 in the neighborhood of $100). Suspect a problem
with your microwave? Might as well buy a new microwave as have it
tested.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am planning to start my DVD collection soon, but am curious
on whether or not I will be able to order discs from the United
Kingdom and play them on my DVD player stateside. I found out the
hard way that movies bought in Great Britain they cannot be played
on VHS players here and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nolan E. Turner
</P>
<P>
   A:Luckily most DVD, or digital versatile disks, covers are
marked Region 1 (Canada, the United States, U.S., U.S. Territories)
or All (all regions).
</P>
<P>
   Other regional coding: includes 2: Japan, Europe, South Africa,
Middle East (including Egypt),; 3: Southeast Asia, East Asia
(including Hong Kong),; 4: Australia, New Zealand, Pacific Islands,
Central America, Mexico, South America, Caribbean,; 5: Former
Soviet Union, Indian Subcontinent, Africa (also North Korea,
Mongolia),; 6: China,; 7: Reserved,; 8: Special international
venues (airplanes, cruise ships, etc.)
</P>
<P>
   There are codeless DVDs as well. And audio DVDs don't have
regional codes. Some DVD players may be modified to play all coded
DVDs. I am still struggling with compact disks.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What constitutes a rack of lamb when listed on a menu in a
restaurant? A friend and I were in a somewhat upscale restaurant in
Toronto where we ordered a ``rack of lamb'' for about C$35
(Canadian). We expected to see a ``rack'' (i.e. a quantity we could
share) and instead got two little lamb chops on a small pile of
shredded veggies. Were we ripped off?
</P>
<P>
   _ M. Meredith
</P>
<P>
   A:''Yes, you were,'' says Four Seasons executive chef Elmar
Prambs. The full rack of lamb is eight to nine bones, and a serving
should be at least three to four chops. A prudent diner could share
this size serving, but a lamb lover would not want to.
</P>
<P>
   When in doubt, always inquire about portions and serving size. A
good waiter will be happy to advise you.
</P>
<P>
   Q:I understood you should never be on the telephone during a
thunderstorm. I was chastised by a brother-in-law for this. He said
our lines were buried; therefore, it was not a problem. Please
clarify.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kenneth C.
</P>
<P>
   A:Odds of being struck by lightning? One in 600,000. Even buried
phone lines can carry electrical charges into your home. ZAP! Many
people have been injured, and some killed, while on telephones
during thunderstorms Make calls during an electrical storm on a
cordless telephone.

   COXNET PTECH 0720 -- The Columbine High killings have prompted
lawsuits against the makers of Doom and cries for a government
crackdown on violent video games. But most parents are probably
unaware that Doom is kid stuff compared with the games that are
coming out now. (Emerson, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) Art
includes one 4-column color photograph of teen playing a video game
and a 2-column color detail photo of a warning label on a video
game.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TECH BRIEFS -- The Discovery Channel's Web site and the
American Museum of Natural History have collaborated on a site that
explores the Earth. (Clothier, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) Aty
includes 18-pica color photo from Web site.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TECHNOBUDDY -- A lot of people in the news industry worry
that somehow the Web and all the news sites there have turned the
newspaper into some sort of a dinosaur, doddering around on its
last legs, dying slowly. There's little chance of that. (Husted,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution.) Art includes 1 column color sig of
columnist.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: GADGETS -- Embarrassed when you're required to show your
passport or student ID because you despise that goofy photo? Here's
help. Sony has come up with a Digital Passport Photo System that
lets you preview and pick your preferred passport photo before it's
printed. (Cummings, Dayton Daily News) Art includes 18-pica color
photo of photo system.
</P>
<P>
   TECH-CENTERPIECE _ COMPUTER-REPAIRS _ In January, a local
consultant's personal computer crashed, and he took it to the
repair counter at an electronics store. After 64 days and a dozen
conflicting excuses, Ted Fowler, the consultant, finally got his
computer back and it still didn't work properly. Though Fowler's
experience was extreme, he, unfortunately, is not alone. Computers
are complex machines, and most home users have only a foggy idea of
their internal workings. So if you're a home computer user, chances
are good your machine is going to need to be repaired at some
point. (Cummings, Dayton Daily News). 41.

Atlanta Journal-Constitution) 18. MOVED
</P>
<P>
   TECH-TOOLS _ The Ultimate DVD Cookbook from Better Homes &AMP;
Gardens fails on several levels. It's like Better Homes has taken
10 separate programs and rolled them all into one. (Warner, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) 16. MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   NETWATCH _ Remember that using computers, what we think of as an
absolute necessity, is still a remote, almost incomprehensible
dream for most of the world's population. (Katz, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) 24. MOVED
</P>
<P>
   CYBERSCENE _ If you're a pet lover, the Web is littered with
sites that can help make your life easier _ whether your pet of
choice is a Chihuahua or a king snake. (Husted, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) 18. MOVED.

   TECH-MEDIA _ There's a revolution under way in how people will

<P>
   GADGETS COLUMN _ If you want to hide the speakers for your high
fidelity sound system so they blend perfectly with the decor of
your rooms, you basically have to cut into walls and ceilings to
install recessed speakers and the wiring to connect them. But if
you're willing to have the speakers minimally visible, you can
choose a flat panel speaker that hangs on the wall. (Dayton Daily
News). 9. MOVED.

CAN TEXAS LIVE WITH PART-TIME GOVERNOR? 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Although the quality of our state government and
public services can be debated, Texas manages to function with a
part-time Legislature. Can it also live with a part-time governor?
</P>
<P>
   The governorship temporarily aside, some academicians and other
experts believe the country's second most populous state would be
better equipped to meet the challenges of the 21st century if it
had a full-time lawmaking body or, at least, a Legislature that met
in regular session more often than 140 days every two years.
</P>
<P>
   But their concerns are drowned out by the huge, collective sigh
of relief that emanates from Austin in late spring of every
odd-numbered year as lobbyists, bureaucrats, reporters and anyone
else connected to the legislative process _ including the lawmakers
themselves _ welcome the Legislature's departure.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators leave a batch of new laws for bureaucrats to digest,
but the bureaucracy _ thousands of employees in hundreds of state
agencies _ continue to collect the taxes, patrol the highways,
guard the prisons, dispense the welfare benefits and perform the
thousands of other chores that keep government running.
</P>
<P>
   This year, it wasn't only the Legislature that cleared out of
town at the end of its biennial session. So did Gov. George W.
Bush, who holds a full-time state job.
</P>
<P>
   Bush didn't just leave town. He left the state, as most of the
world probably knows by now, to begin his national campaign for
president. From June 1, the day after the Legislature adjourned,
through July 14, he was out of state for 11 full days and parts of
10 others (including weekends), and those were just for starters.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not criticizing Bush for running for president. That's his
prerogative, and many Texans, who expected him to run for the White
House when they overwhelmingly re-elected him last year, are
applauding his effort.
</P>
<P>
   But his frequent absences make one wonder if being governor of
Texas is really a full-time job, because state government hasn't
really missed him.
</P>
<P>
   The most important state business that Bush has conducted since
legislators went home was to sign hundreds of bills into law and
veto a number of others. He completed that task June 20, his
constitutional deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also has appointed or reappointed more than two
dozen people to various state boards and appointed two judges to
vacancies on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   And he has allowed two executions to proceed as scheduled. Since
the Board of Pardons and Paroles didn't recommend clemency in those
cases, all Bush could have done was to delay the executions for 30
days, which he has always refused to do.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been away from home so much that he has properly
decided to give up his state pay _ $316 a day _ when he is out of
state.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, a fellow Republican, is the first in line
to be governor and collect the higher governor's pay when Bush is
away. But there also have been several days in which both Bush and
Perry were out of state and Senate President Pro Tem Rodney Ellis,
a Democrat from Houston and the next in line, was acting governor.
</P>
<P>
   One day last month Ellis also was gone, and House Speaker Pete
Laney, the fourth in succession, got the top job for a day.
</P>
<P>
   Perry and Ellis each let an execution be carried out but
otherwise haven't had to be very gubernatorial.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's formal powers are strictly limited by the state
constitution. The governor signs and vetoes bills and calls and
sets the agenda for special legislative sessions, but no one is
expecting a special session and lawmakers won't meet again in
regular session until January 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also appoints hundreds of people to policy-setting
state boards and commissions, but those appointees _ and the
bureaucrats who work for them _ run the agencies. The governor
doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Could Texas survive with a part-time governor? Probably. Under
some of Bush's predecessors, there were times when state government
seemed to operate on automatic pilot, and those governors weren't
even running for president.
</P>
<P>
   But most Texans will always want a full-time governor _ even one
who is absent a lot _ because, to most people, the governor
symbolizes state government. And his political philosophy, if
successfully presented, can set a tone for state government.
</P>
<P>
   Perry, who shares many of Bush's priorities and will inherit his
job for real if Bush is elected president, certainly doesn't intend
to make any waves in Bush's absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is done in close coordination with the governor's
office,'' Perry spokesman Eric Bearse said.

LESS THAN $1,000 BUT MORE THAN ZEROS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The low-priced desktop is now the best-selling consumer PC
category _ and fiercely competitive. What was once considered a
technology graveyard where older components went to die has now
become the liveliest spot in the market.
</P>
<P>
   But some manufacturers do cheap PCs better than others. Let's
face it, when you are selling a system for $500, $600, $700,
corners will be cut. How a computer maker cuts those corners makes
all the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at two systems with different approaches to
getting the price under $1,000:
</P>
<P>
   _ Presario 5304, $599, Compaq Computer Corp.: At first glance,
this is one of the best bargains among cheap PCs. The
specifications look great for the price, and Compaq is pushing this
with a 17-inch monitor _ the MV720 _ that sells for just $400.
Combined, you get a powerful system and a large display for just
under $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   But be sure and read the fine print on this one.
</P>
<P>
   The 5304 comes with a Cyrix MII processor that's rated at 366
megahertz, 64 megabytes of random access memory, a 4.3-gigabyte
hard drive, a 32X CD-ROM drive, a four-megabyte graphics adapter,
56K fax modem and Compaq's versatile Internet keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   But the kicker here is the processor, memory and video adapter.
The MII is usually found on computers in which the video card uses
system memory as its own memory. So, while the 5304 has 64
megabytes of RAM, four MB are in use by the video card, leaving 60
MB for operating system and applications.
</P>
<P>
   To Compaq's credit, it has at least stocked this PC with 64 MB
of RAM. Many companies that use the MII chip are putting only 32 MB
in their lower-end machines, then using 2 MB for video memory.
Running Windows 98 with just 30 MB can be painful.
</P>
<P>
   The 5304 performs quite nicely with everyday programs _ word
processors, e-mail, Web browsers. But some graphics-intensive
programs can cause it to bog down. For example, I tried out
Mindscape's Organic Art Deluxe, a 3-D art and screen saver program
that makes heavy use of Direct3D, Microsoft's 3-D graphics scheme.
The images moved slowly and at times even haltingly.
</P>
<P>
   It also did not handle games well. In fact, if you want to run
any state-of-the-art 3-D titles, such as Unreal, Half-Life, Need
for Speed III or the upcoming Quake III Arena, I'd highly recommend
you supplement this PC with a Voodoo2-based 3-D add-on card, such
as Diamond Multimedia's Monster II.
</P>
<P>
   The system is quite expandable for a low cost, with a free PCI
slot, one combo PCI/ISA slot, and an ISA slot.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq also has made its Internet keyboard friendlier. Previous
versions were hard to reprogram, making it difficult to get away
from the company's default Web sites and applications.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Compaq also offers several deals for getting on the
Net. There are special offers from America Online and the company's
new Compaq.net service, and even a free online service called
NetZero. The latter requires that you turn over personal
information about yourself, then agree to have a set of ad banners
on your screen whenever you go online. Obviously, there's no free
surf.
</P>
<P>
   _ Select 400, $999, Gateway: Between the time I received this
low-end system from Gateway and the publication of this review, the
direct-sales PC maker has changed the configuration of this system.
Frankly, the model I tried has better specs than what the Gateway
is offering now at $999.
</P>
<P>
   The system I tried has a 400-Mhz Advanced Micro Devices K6-2
chip, 64 MB of memory, a 4.3-GB hard drive, a 40X CD-ROM drive, an
eight-MB ATI Rage Pro video card, a 56K fax modem and a 15-inch
monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Since it arrived, Gateway has reduced the amount of memory to 32
MB and increased the hard drive size to 6.8 GB. Given the choice,
I'd rather have more memory. And fortunately, since you can
configure a Gateway any way you want it, you do have a choice, but
the model I actually used will now cost you $1,048. Bummer.
</P>
<P>
   This is one zippy computer _ at least with 64 MB. The eight MB
graphics card also helps. It easily handled the Organic Art
program, Need for Speed III and other titles that use Direct3D.
However, the ATI Rage Pro is not great when it comes to games that
use SGI's OpenGL 3-D graphics system, such as most of the
Quake-based games.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Compaq, the Select 400 comes with a keyboard that also
has buttons, though they are more geared toward launching
applications than Web pages. One button _ dubbed The Help Spot _
brings up a friendly tutorial on using the PC and fixing common
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Gateway has only two open PCI slots and no ISA slots. If
you've got an older card you want to drop in here, forget it. This
is also a glimpse of the future _ starting next year, nearly every
PC sold will have only PCI and AGP (for graphics) slots. Time and
technology marches on.

IF YOU'RE THINKING OF BUYING A NEW PC, HERE ARE SILVERMAN'S MINIMUM
SPECS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I have been wanting to buy a new PC, but I was waiting for
your semiannual recommendation on minimum specs in your column.
When do you plan to run it?
</P>
<P>
   A: We've changed how we run the minimum specifications
recommendation. Previously, it ran twice a year in my column,
usually at midsummer and again at the start of the Christmas
PC-buying season.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the minimum specs piece ran as a feature story in
late November (see
www.chron.com/content/chronicle/tech/98/11/27/main.html), and
that's how we'll handle it for the foreseeable future. But it makes
sense to offer a mid-year ``refresher.''
</P>
<P>
   The declining cost of computers makes buying a ``minimum''
machine almost painless. The cost of PCs has dropped so
dramatically that a system that sold for $2,000 last Christmas now
sells for less than half that. And it's still an incredibly
powerful machine.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the minimum specs I'd recommend if you were buying
today:
</P>
<P>
   _ Processor: You'll want at least a 366-megahertz chip, though
400 megahertz is better, and the difference in cost is often
negligible. Avoid chips, such as some Cyrix MII processors, that
require that video memory be ``borrowed'' from the main system
memory.
</P>
<P>
   _ Memory: At least 64 megabytes of RAM. If you buy a budget
system that has only 32 megabytes, it's fairly affordable to bump
it up another 32, usually for well under $100.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hard drive: Four gigabytes remains a minimum, but like memory,
drive prices are way down. And, unfortunately, the size of the
average program is way, way up. A six-gigabyte drive is preferable.
</P>
<P>
   _ CD or DVD: The minimum PC can still get by with a CD-ROM
drive, with a speed of at least 24X, or 24 times the speed of the
original CD-ROM drive. DVD-based software remains a rarity, but
getting at least a 2X DVD-ROM drive would better prepare your
system for the future.
</P>
<P>
   _ Video: If your needs are modest _ Web surfing, word
processing, home finance, working at home _ then a four-megabyte
video card is just fine. If, however, you play games at all, or are
interested in working with graphics, you'll want a card with at
least eight or 16 megabytes of video memory. And again, avoid those
video adapters that use system memory as video memory.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sound: Nearly every PC comes with at least 16-bit stereo audio
that's more than adequate for most needs. However, if you are
interested in better sound for games and multimedia, consider a
card that can do 3-D or positional audio.
</P>
<P>
   _ Modems: All PCs now come with 56K modems. If possible, avoid
``winmodems,'' which can only work with Windows applications and
use commands stored on the hard disk _ rather than in a chip on the
modem itself. I've found they are not as reliable, though the
latest crop of winmodems seem to be a vast improvement. That's
good, because many PC makers now offer only winmodems in their
systems.
</P>
<P>
   _ Monitor: You'll want at least a 15-inch monitor with a maximum
.28 dot pitch. Seventeen-inch monitors are now as inexpensive as
15-inch models were a year ago, and you'll appreciate the extra
real estate if you work with multiple applications at once.
</P>
<P>
   _ Expandability: Gone are the days when bottom-of-the-line PCs
had sealed cases and you could not add new cards or capabilities.
You'll want at least two free PCI slots inside the computer and at
least one free drive bay. Some systems are now coming without an
older, ISA slot. If you have a device that uses an ISA card, you'll
want to be sure to ask about this before buying a new PC. Starting
next year, ISA slots will completely disappear.
</P>

TRAVELERS WIN IN CRUISE TUG-OF-WAR 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ With Carnival and Premier planning to join Norwegian
Cruise Line next year in basing ships in this area, competition for
the passenger dollar will be intense.
</P>
<P>
   Already, though, we can project winners.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost is the traveler, who will benefit from a choice of
itineraries and onboard styles and from the likelihood _ with three
lines vying for customers _ of attractive price structures.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the ports of Houston and Galveston are clearly emerging as
major players in the cruise industry, a factor that impacts
positively on the entire area economy.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, more than 4,000 passengers a week are expected to set
sail from the two ports once Premier's IslandBreeze and Carnival's
Celebration arrive next year in May and October, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,146-passenger IslandBreeze will depart on Saturdays from
the Port of Houston for Veracruz, Cozumel and Playa del Carmen in
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,486-passenger Celebration will sail on four- and five-day
itineraries from Galveston to alternating ports on Mexico's Yucatan
Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,518 passenger Norwegian Sea will continue its weekly
Sunday departures from the Port of Houston to Cancun and Cozumel,
Mexico, and Roatan in Honduras' Bay Islands.
</P>
<P>
   All passengers will be offered an opportunity to book pre- or
post-cruise vacations in this part of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
STARTING A TREND &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These vessels may soon have company, too, suggests Premier
president Bruce Nierenberg, who as an NCL executive was largely
responsible for bringing the first home-based passenger ship to the
Port of Houston in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said then that we thought this would be a five-ship market
within five years,'' Nierenberg says. ``Well, you've already got
three ships. All you need now is more berths (terminal space) and
infrastructure, and you'll blow away that five-ship prediction.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing the area's high drive-in population base, convenient
flight schedules and the income levels of many potential
passengers, Nierenberg says, ``From an operator's standpoint,
Houston is a slam dunk.''
</P>
<P>
   Nierenberg says he anticipates Premier bringing a second ship
here within another year. Speculation has centered on the company
purchasing the 1,010-passenger Edinburgh Castle, currently idle in
England, and introducing its popular Big Red Boat family cruise
concept in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Also, says industry veteran Nierenberg, ``With Carnival coming
here, I'll be surprised if Royal Caribbean doesn't bring in a
ship.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MAKING ROOM &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Critical to attracting more ships _ including newer and larger
vessels _ is the Port of Houston's aspirations to build five cruise
berths, capable of handling up to 12 weekly departures, at the Ned
S. Holmes Bayport Container Terminal. That proposal is part of a
$387 million bond issue to be put before voters Nov. 2.
</P>
<P>
   The Barbours Cut facility currently used includes only one berth
for cruise ships. And, says Port Authority chairman Holmes, Houston
can't handle ships much larger than the Norwegian Sea until new
facilities are available.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Port of Houston hoped to lure Carnival, the world's
largest cruise line, Holmes says, ``Whether Carnival came to
Houston or Galveston, it's an important endorsement of this market
as a home port.
</P>
<P>
   ``The competition for Carnival was strong, and Galveston was
willing to make a deal that we weren't willing to make. Having said
that, we'd much rather see a ship come to Galveston than to New
Orleans or Jacksonville (Florida).''
</P>
<P>
   While Carnival and Premier both are on the low-to-moderate end
of the scale in terms of pricing (as is NCL), they offer a marked
contrast in style and substance.
</P>
<P>
   Carnival, known for its ``Fun Ship'' approach, features some of
the newest and glitziest ships afloat; the Celebration, at 47,000
tons and introduced in 1987, is among its smaller vessels but (also
like the Norwegian Sea) offers a plethora of options for
entertainment and open-deck activities.
</P>
<P>
   The Celebration currently is based in New Orleans and will be
replaced there by a larger ship, a pattern Carnival has
traditionally followed when projects are successful.
</P>
<P>
   The shorter itineraries are a boon to potential first-time
cruisers and to travelers with limited time and/or budgets.
</P>
<P>
   With a considerably older fleet _ including the 31,000-ton
IslandBreeze, built in 1961, previously operated by Carnival as its
Festivale and now based in Europe _ Premier is focusing on personal
service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are calling ourselves the official cruise line of the
individual,'' proclaims Nierenberg, who likens the line's new
approach to that of a grand land resort.
</P>
<P>
   The Veracruz port calls loom intriguing. That Mexican state
offers numerous unsung lures _ from adventure-oriented to
historical attractions _ beyond its port city, and the IslandBreeze
will spend much of a day and well into the night there, allowing
for extensive shore excursions.
</P>
<P>
   The impending presence of Carnival and Premier is due in no
small part to NCL's success as a pioneer. The line experienced
much-publicized problems with its original Houston-based ship, the
Norwegian Star (now sailing in the South Pacific), but maintained
high load factors even on that vessel and doubled its potential
capacity last December with the Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Allowing for third and fourth beds in a normal two-passenger
stateroom, the Sea has been sailing regularly at or above its
published capacity this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been the market leader, and we're really pleased,'' says
NCL executive vice president Art Sbarksy. ``Since we're the ones
who took the initial risk in Houston, we're flattered that others
are following our lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only time will tell how things will work out, but this does
bring more overall awareness of the Houston market. I think it will
continue to expand as a cruise port; that's why we increased our
capacity.''

<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ Even travelers immersed in baseball lore are
advised to allow time here for two museums unrelated to the sport:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Fenimore Art Museum occupies a 1930s mansion built on the
site of James Fenimore Cooper's home, overlooking Lake Otsego. (The
town was founded in 1786 by William Cooper, the author's father.)
</P>
<P>
   Its collection contains some of the best examples of American
landscape, history and genre paintings _ including works by Thomas
Cole, Gilbert Stuart and Benjamin West _ and outstanding
representations of American Indian and folk art.
</P>
<P>
   One of the museum's most popular rooms is devoted to 22 bronze
portrait busts of early American statesmen, heroes and celebrities
cast from lifemasks made by sculptor John H.I. Browere between 1823
and 1833. Among figures represented are U.S. presidents Thomas
Jefferson, John Adams, James Madison, John Quincy Adams and Martin
Van Buren.
</P>
<P>
   Special exhibits this year include works by Georgia O'Keeffe,
John Kensett and Grandma Moses.
</P>
<P>
   The mansion is also headquarters for the New York State
Historical Association.
</P>
<P>
   _ Directly across New York 28, a short drive north of downtown,
and also occupying property once owned by James Fenimore Cooper,
the Farmers' Museum replicates an 1840s village. In it, skilled
craftspeople practice _ and educate visitors about _ farming and
many of the other trades and arts of that era.
</P>
<P>
   The village includes 20 buildings; the property spreads over
several acres and also features a heritage garden and rare animal
breeds.
</P>
<P>
   Especially fascinating is the one-room American Paper-Staining
Manufactory, unique in the nation, where artisans use tools and
methods used in the early 1800s to make all-cotton paper that lasts
for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   A new exhibit for 1999 details how this area was once the
nation's leading producer of hops.
</P>
<P>
   Both museums are open 10 a.m.-5 p.m. daily in summer; hours vary
the remainder of the year. Admission is $9 per museum or $14.50 for
both, with discounts for children and senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants are open for lunch at both museums.
</P>
<P>
   Combination tickets that include the Fenimore Art Museum,
Farmers' Museum and National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum also
are available.

   ERNEST-HEMINGWAY (Undated) _ ``True at First Light,'' culled
from a work Ernest Hemingway chose not to publish, is at least
worth reading for the cast of safari characters who are a patchwork
quilt of tribes and religions and superstitions. Billed as a
``fictional memoir'' and yet a ``revealing self-portrait and
fictional chronicle of his final African safari,'' it closely
parallels accounts of Hemingway's time in Kenya with his fourth
wife, Mary Welsh Hemingway. By JESSICA BARBARO.

   TV-PREVIEWS (Pasadena, Calif.) _ The popular success of such
shows as ``The Sopranos'' and ``Sex and the City'' _ among many
other original, daring offerings _ has illustrated just how far
cable has come in the television universe. But it's easy to forget
that what brought new viewers to pay-cable channels such as HBO and
Showtime was high-quality, original movies. By TIM GOODMAN.

pilgrimage carried out every day by men and women ages 1 to 100 _
all kids at heart, smitten by an intoxicating infatuation with a

HARRY SHATTUCK

<P>
   TRAVEL-COLUMN (Houston) _ With Carnival and Premier planning to
join Norwegian Cruise Line next year in basing ships in this area,

benefit from a choice of itineraries and onboard styles and from
the likelihood _ with three lines vying for customers _ of
attractive price structures. By HARRY SHATTUCK.

confounding a field of the world's best players this week at the
British Open, we are forced to raise the issue of ``playability.''

remember the good ol' days.'' By TOM STIENSTRA.
</P>
<P>
   TEN-DAVENPORT (San Francisco) _ Its' amazing that the girl who
always stood out because she was 6-feet-2 in sneakers can manage to
hide so well in a professional women's tennis tournament. While the
press busies itself chasing stories about others, Lindsay Davenport
plays, wins, packs her duffel and makes her way, unimpeded, to the
next match. By MICHELLE SMITH.

   BBA-FAME (Cooperatown, N.Y.) _ In the chronicle of baseball, a

   COMPUTER-COLUMN (Undated) _ The low-priced desktop is now the

some manufacturers do cheap PCs better than others. By DWIGHT
SILVERMAN

BASEBALL HITS A HOME RUN IN COOPERSTOWN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ Your imagination requires only the slightest
prodding upon arrival in this lovely village seemingly transplanted
from another era.
</P>
<P>
   Step out of the car. And into a Norman Rockwell painting.
</P>
<P>
   Into a pure and simple setting void of fast-food parlors and
sterile malls and pollution and squalor, a place where the
policeman smiles, tips his hat and says, ``Have a great day'' with
all sincerity as he hands you a parking ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, you are a kid again. In a baseball uniform. Moseying
glove in hand along an idyllic and squeaky-clean Main Street USA
lined with baskets of brightly colored geraniums and petunias
hanging from lampposts, pausing to window-shop outside stores
dubbed America's Game, National Pastime, Third Base, Mickey's Place
and Where It All Began.
</P>
<P>
   Savoring a soft drink at the Doubleday Cafe or Short Stop
Restaurant or Shoeless Joe's Outdoor Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   Discovering an empty nook in the wooden bleachers at Doubleday
Stadium, joining in the spirit of a college or high school _ or
senior citizens _ game in progress on the most hallowed field of
dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Following in the footsteps of legends: Babe Ruth. Ty Cobb.
Jackie Robinson. Joe DiMaggio. Ted Williams. Hank Aaron.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   A fantasy? Not really. It's a pilgrimage carried out every day
by men and women ages 1 to 100 _ all kids at heart, smitten by an
intoxicating infatuation with a game and its history, its lore, its
heroes.
</P>
<P>
   Almost worshipful, they congregate 70 miles west of Albany in a
community of only 2,400 permanent residents that hugs the unruffled
waters of Lake Otsego, the ``Glimmerglass'' described by native son
James Fenimore Cooper in his ``Leatherstocking Tales.''
</P>
<P>
   This summer, many among the faithful come to celebrate Ryan _
the ``Alvin Express'' and all-time no-hit and strikeout king _ who
on July 25 will gain official induction into the National Baseball
Hall of Fame, Cooperstown's lifeblood.
</P>
<P>
   Haven't made travel plans for the occasion? Not to worry. Ryan's
induction exhibit, which includes memorabilia associated with his
tenure as a pitcher with the Houston Astros and Texas Rangers, is
already in place and will remain on display at the Hall of Fame and
Museum through next spring. And Nolan is the focal point of a
permanent exhibit on no-hitters.
</P>
<P>
   The attention surrounding Ryan's inclusion in the Class of '99,
along with fellow stars Robin Yount and George Brett, has
contributed to record visitation, on a pace to total 460,000 by
year's end and help reverse a downward spiral begun four years
earlier when a bitter labor dispute all but destroyed the game's
bond with many longtime loyalists.
</P>
<P>
   Even more significant factors are new legends Mark McGwire and
Sammy Sosa _ both for their on-the-field exploits and the numerous
artifacts each donated to the shrine's current ``The Great American
Home Run Chase'' centerpiece exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   If the successful pursuit of Roger Maris' single-season home run
record last year by McGwire and Sosa signaled a rebirth of baseball
enthusiasm nationwide, it merely reinforced the fascination here.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Cooperstown is where it all began.
</P>
<P>
   Or did it?
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptians, as explained in Hall of Fame exhibits, actually
played games with bats and balls as early as 2000 B.C. And
subsequent variations appeared from Japan to France, from Ethiopia
to England.
</P>
<P>
   But Abner Doubleday, so legend holds, ``invented'' baseball in
his hometown in 1839 when he chased the cows out of Elihu Phinney's
pasture and diagrammed a playing field on the site of the stadium
that now bears his name. Doubleday is said to have refined the
already popular game of ``Town Ball'' by limiting the number of
players, introducing the concept of a pitcher and catcher and
adding bases _ hence, the name.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that records indicate Doubleday _ who eventually
gained acclaim as an officer in the Mexican and Civil wars _ was a
plebe in residence at the U.S. Military Academy in West Point,
N.Y., at the time. Or that he made no mention of the accomplishment
in his diaries.
</P>
<P>
   Or that New York City fireman Alexander Cartwright, not
Doubleday, established the first known baseball team (the New York
Knickerbockers) in 1845 and devised the first set of playing rules
for ``America's game'' that has evolved today.
</P>
<P>
   Few myths _ if indeed the Abner Doubleday saga is a myth _ have
held such lasting influence.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, there is the matter of what became known as the
``Doubleday baseball,'' a tattered, misshapen, homemade
cloth-stuffed sphere discovered in a farmhouse attic three miles
into the countryside in 1934. It was found among the possessions of
Abner Graves, a Doubleday contemporary who claimed to be present
when the other Abner was tinkering with bases and baselines.
</P>
<P>
   Cooperstown resident and philanthropist Stephen C. Clark, after
purchasing the baseball for $5, conceived the idea of displaying it
in a room in what was the village club. That led to an expanded
exhibition of artifacts associated with the sport and attracted the
interest of baseball's leadership in establishing a museum to
coincide with an honor roll of the game's immortals.
</P>
<P>
   On June 12, 1939, commemorating the 100th anniversary of
Doubleday's reputed cow-chasing, the National Baseball Hall of Fame
and Museum was dedicated.
</P>
<P>
   And this tiny village has been immersed in baseball ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Not entirely absorbed, though.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, Cooperstown is blessed with riches that extend beyond
sport. Its Fenimore Art Museum houses one of the finest collections
in this part of the nation; the sprawling Farmers' Museum provides
a remarkable introspective on rural America in the mid-1800s; and
productions at the Glimmerglass Opera, only a 10-minute drive away,
are internationally applauded.
</P>
<P>
   Some homes and churches date to the early 19th century, a
handful to the 1790s; a walking tour map available at the visitor
center on Chestnut Street (New York 28) pinpoints more than 40
landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   The lake and its surrounding woodlands are centers for
recreation, with Glimmerglass State Park (situated on the eastern
shore with the opera house on the opposite bank) especially popular
for picnicking and camping. Some visitors linger for days in this
region of upstate New York to fish or paddle away their worries in
a canoe.
</P>
<P>
   Many a nonbaseball fan, gracious enough to tag along on a
companion's pilgrimage, has discovered a different kind of escape
by sinking into a rocking chair on the sweeping veranda of the
Otesaga, a grand 90-year-old resort overlooking the lake and only a
five-minute stroll from Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cuisine at the Otesaga and at Gabriella's on the Square _ just
locate the town's only stoplight and follow the scintillating aroma
_ should please even the most finicky diners. And when the
fuzzy-cheeked waiter at a less refined eatery on Main Street opens
a bottle of wine and says, ``I'm kind of surprised that the cork on
this `Val-pok-li-cla' is still wet considering how long the bottle
has stood in the windowsill,'' ... well, where else can you dine in
your baseball uniform?
</P>
<P>
   Besides, there is always Old Slugger Beer. Nine Man Ale. Strike
Out Stout. And Benchwarmer Porter. For older kids, that is. All
produced by the Cooperstown Brewing Co., one of two area breweries
that offer public tours.
</P>
<P>
   Not every shop is baseball-oriented: National Pastime, for one,
specializes in art and customized embroidery. But suffice it to say
that serious collectors and souvenir hunters alike will find heaven
on Earth here.
</P>
<P>
   What's your pleasure? A Mark McGwire trash can? Toronto Blue
Jays lawn chair? Cal Ripken jigsaw puzzle? Boston Red Sox throw
rug? Ken Griffey Christmas ornament? Or _ no joke _ an Astros
ponytail holder?
</P>
<P>
   At the Where It All Began Bat Company, limited-edition Nolan
Ryan commemorative bats, produced under the auspices of the Hall of
Fame, are engraved with the pitcher's induction date and his
record. Cut into the bat are silver or bronze coins adorned with
Nolan's photo. Cost is $159.95 for one of 1,999 silver-coin
editions or $99.95 for one of 5,000 bronze-coin bats.
</P>
<P>
   On a tighter budget? A Nolan Ryan miniature train _ an express
no doubt, with an engine followed by individual cars that
commemorate his seven no hitters, 5,714 strikeouts and 324 major
league victories _ sells for only $29.95.
</P>
<P>
   But the real stuff _ materialistic stuff, anyway _ of which Ryan
and so many other legends were made is not for sale. It's preserved
for the ages at the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, it's true that Ryan's induction exhibit features a Rangers
jersey worn during the sixth of his seven no-hitters on June 11,
1990. But also prominent are an Astros cap and baseball from April
27, 1983, when Nolan passed Walter Johnson as the all-time career
strikeout leader, and another Astros cap worn on July 11, 1985,
when Ryan recorded his 4,000th strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibits honoring the soon-to-be-inducted Ryan, Yount, Brett,
Orlando Cepeda, Negro Leagues star Smokey Joe Williams, umpire
Nestor Chylack and 19th-century manager Frank Selee flank one
extreme of the formal Hall of Fame gallery on the first floor near
the Main Street entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Bronze plaques commemorating their achievements will soon join
those of 237 previous inductees lining the alcoved gallery's oak
walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Great American Home Run Chase'' exhibit at the rear of the
gallery serves as an almost magnetic attraction, especially for
younger fans. On display here is the bat McGwire swung _ and the
ball he hit _ to break Maris' 37-year-old single-season standard.
So are other bats, balls, gloves and jerseys associated with the
dramatic performances by McGwire and Sosa last September.
</P>
<P>
   And remember McGwire embracing his batboy son after hitting
record homer No. 62? Young Matt's jersey is here, too.
</P>
<P>
   Maris, Ruth, Aaron, Mickey Mantle and other sluggers from the
major and minor leagues also are celebrated in this beautifully
arranged exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   And this is merely the beginning. Indeed, allow several hours _
or several visits _ to explore the museum's three levels.
</P>
<P>
   The most extensive exhibit, spreading over much of the second
floor, offers a chronological history of the game, with separate
wings devoted to Ruth, Aaron, African-American legends (including
Negro Leagues stars), women in baseball, umpires and scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Among the artifacts is the bat used by Ruth for his ``called
shot'' in the 1932 World Series; Ty Cobb's sliding pads; Joe
DiMaggio's locker; Jackie Robinson's warmup jacket; and the uniform
jersey worn by 3-foot-7-inch, 65-pound Eddie Gaedel, employed by
master promoter Bill Veeck to bat for the St. Louis Browns in a
1951 game. (Gaedel walked on four pitches and never appeared
again.)
</P>
<P>
   On the third level, an exhibit on equipment includes the
original catcher's mask, resembling a bird cage and first worn at
Harvard University in 1876. Nearby, the evolution of the uniform is
traced with more than 60 outfits, including the earliest woolen
flannels worn in Baraboo, Wis., in 1866.
</P>
<P>
   Astros fans will find plenty to cheer:
</P>
<P>
   The no-hit exhibit, on the ground level, understandably
showcases Ryan, with artifacts including the Astros cap he wore
during his fifth no-hitter on Sept. 26, 1981, in the Astrodome.
Photos honor every other major league no-hit pitcher, including
Houston manager Larry Dierker for his gem on July 9, 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Astros broadcaster Milo Hamilton, inducted into a special wing
in 1992, is feted in a ``Scribes and Mikemen'' exhibit that also
includes Harry Caray's oversized eyeglasses, Lindsey Nelson's
multicolored sports jacket and Grantland Rice's typewriter.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton's voice is here, too: His stirring call of Aaron's
record-setting 715th career home run in 1974, when Milo was an
Atlanta Braves announcer, resounds through the room devoted to that
legend.
</P>
<P>
   The Astrodome's role as baseball's first domed stadium gets
considerable attention within a third-floor exhibit on ballparks.
And, no, the huge photographs here won't be removed when Enron
Field opens.
</P>
<P>
   There is so much more _ two theaters (one arranged as a
grandstand); an authentic major league locker room; exhibits on the
World Series and youth leagues and the stars of today; a bookstore
and library; and an art gallery whose treasures represent the work
(among others) of Andy Warhol, Leroy Neiman and, appropriately,
Norman Rockwell.

   The museum's inventory has grown so large that only about 30
percent is on display at any one time.

<P>
   Still, the true baseball fan's pilgrimage doesn't end here. One
last stroll down Main Street USA is required, then through a
parking lot to red-bricked Doubleday Stadium where, at least three
times daily during summer, organized teams pay only $250 to play on
their field of dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Wander inside at your leisure _ there is usually no charge _ and
sit in the old wooden bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   And marvel at what Abner Doubleday wrought _ didn't he? _ here
in Elihu Phinney's pasture.
</P>
<P>
   And reflect on myths and legends.

   Summer is prime time for stalking wildlife with a camera, and
national parks offer a terrific backdrop. Glacier Park Inc. and the
Center for Wildlife Information offer these tips for enjoyable and
safe photography:
</P>
<P>
   _ Stay in designated observation areas and use telephoto lenses
or binoculars.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you are hiking, stay on trails.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you are driving, stop only at established pullouts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't feel you need a full-frame view of your subject;
photographs are easily enlarged or cropped.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use a tripod to steady your camera. A bean bag or folded
jacket can be used as a camera rest atop a car, but be sure to turn
off the car's engine to minimize camera movement.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use high-speed film.
</P>
<P>
   _ Focus your photography safaris on the early morning or evening
hours, when animals are most active.

HUDSON VALLEY POPULAR WITH VISITORS (FROM SPACE) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL GRONDAHL  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ You won't find it touted in ``I Love New York''
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   But the Hudson Valley has gained national attention as a
destination for tourists hoping for a close encounter of the alien
kind.
</P>
<P>
   Pine Bush, Orange County, and a stretch of the lower Hudson
Valley along Westchester County ranked No. 3 in the United States
among the top 10 hot spots for sightings of unidentified flying
objects (UFOs).
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the region were reluctant to embrace the notoriety.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's pretty far-fetched, although there a lot of crazy
people in Pine Bush who believe in UFOs,'' said Marge, manager of
Pine Bush Video, who asked that her last name not be used.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's the engines of UFOs parked above us that caused the
heat wave,'' said Craig Read, manager of Pine Bush Auto Parts. ``I
haven't heard of any new sightings in a while, but there are a lot
of believers around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Pine Bush and the Hudson Valley were ranked in a newly published
book, ``UFO USA: A Traveler's Guide to UFO Sightings, Abduction
Sites, Crop Circles, and Other Unexplained Phenomena'' (Hyperion,
$12.95).
</P>
<P>
   The Hudson Valley was outpaced only by Rachel, Nev., and
Roswell, N.M. The distinction for New York drew a mixed reaction on
both sides of the UFO divide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice recognition because New York state is not well
known as a hot spot for UFO sightings,'' said James Bouck of
Rotterdam, an auditor with the state comptroller's office and
assistant director for New York's Mutual UFO Network, MUFON.
</P>
<P>
   Bouck and several MUFON members made fall trips each of the last
three years to Pine Bush, northwest of Newburgh. But they saw
nothing unusual during their night sky watches. Bouck doesn't
expect to return this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Pine Bush area has slowed down for sightings. It
was at its peak several years ago,'' Bouck said.
</P>
<P>

<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A surge of Hudson Valley UFO reports began in 1983, and
continued through the late-1980s. They were chronicled in a 1987
book, ``Night Siege: The Hudson Valley UFO Sightings'' (Ballantine,
$6.95). The unidentified flying object became known as the
``Westchester Boomerang.'' The object was described repeatedly as a
massive, V-shaped craft that hovered above the tree line and
featured eerie lights.
</P>
<P>
   None of the books about UFOs, or national rankings of hot spots,
swayed the opinion of Michael Sofka of Guilderland, a systems
programmer at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and president of
the Inquiring Skeptics of Upper New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen nothing from the UFO people that convinces me,''
Sofka said. ``I can think of a variety of other possibilities that
don't involve aliens and UFOs that are perfectly rational.''
</P>
<P>
   Sofka said he would explain most reports of UFOs as weather
balloons, conventional aircraft, stars, planets and an optical
illusion called the auto-kinetic effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of perceptual effects that can make common
objects seem unreal or unidentified,'' Sofka said. ``If a person is
not familiar with the night sky and doesn't have experience
identifying stars and planets, they can mistake a lot of things for
UFOs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always figured these sightings in Pine Bush had something
to do with the fact that Stewart International Airport is nearby,''
said Joe Spinelli, a volunteer at Pine Bush Bible Camp, who lives
about 6 miles from the airport and sees many unusual aircraft
flying overhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of people here claim they've seen UFOs, but I've
never had the time or interest to go out at night, park my car and
wait for a UFO to come,'' Spinelli said.
</P>
<P>
   But to those who call themselves UFO investigators, a lack of
convincing evidence does not preclude the possibility of aliens
from outer space visiting Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had friends whom I respect tell me they saw huge objects
in the Hudson Valley at least the size of a football field and
their accounts are credible to me,'' said Raymond Cecot of
Niskayuna, a state employee and founder of The Independent
Researchers' Association for Anomalous Phenomena, or IRAAP. Cecot
left MUFON and in 1997 formed IRAAP, which has 55 members in 13
states and Britain. Cecot publishes two newsletters.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get a lot of people reporting they saw strange
objects in the sky, even if you discount 90 percent of them,
there's still a good possibility that there's something out
there,'' Cecot said. ``There is an aspect of strange and
unaccountable phenomena that can't just be discounted.''

`FICTIONAL MEMOIR' DELVES INTO HEMINGWAY'S DOMESTIC LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JESSICA BARBARO  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The famously spare writing of Ernest Hemingway won him the Nobel
Prize for literature and a place at the head of the table of 20th
century writers. But not everyone loved his swagger.
</P>
<P>
   Without benefit of higher education, the young Hemingway went to
work for the Kansas City Star. He learned to keep his prose strong
and lean, and it served him as he went off to find the stories.
</P>
<P>
   Paris. Pamplona. Italy. Cuba. Key West. Lions and leopards and
giant marlin. Khaki hunting clothes and Papa's old friend, the
flask. Nothing was too large to swallow whole and pound into the
pithy work with its beautiful, hard people who had seen too much.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1961, Hemingway killed himself with a shotgun blast, but
that was not the end of his stories.
</P>
<P>
   Instinct must have told Hemingway to remand to the vault the
work that didn't ring true. The sad thing about being an American
icon and speaking to millions of people is that there is no room to
grow old and tired and write bad books. When those people look
again and don't find themselves there, they will feel lost and hate
you for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``True at First Light'' is culled from a work Ernest Hemingway
chose not to publish. It is exhumed and edited from a manuscript
twice its size and served up by his son Patrick on the eve of what
would have been Hemingway's 100th birthday. One cannot know what
has been lost.
</P>
<P>
   Billed as a ``fictional memoir'' and yet a ``revealing
self-portrait and fictional chronicle of his final African
safari,'' it closely parallels accounts of Hemingway's time in
Kenya with his fourth wife, Mary Welsh Hemingway, during 1953-54.
It is a memoir filled with minutiae. Like life, it plods along, but
there are no bouts of joy here to offset the endless trips to town
for beer and Coca-Cola and the visits from villagers seeking
protection from marauding beasts and the breakfasts of liver.
</P>
<P>
   There are flashes of a sadness so alive it rips through him like
the lead that bites the flesh of his prey. It lies with him at
night as the lions cough and the hyenas circle the camp.
</P>
<P>
   He writes: ``I woke twice sweating with nightmares. The last one
was a very bad one and I reached out under the mosquito net and
felt for the water bottle and the square flask of gin. In the dark
I rolled my pillow up so I could lay back with my head against it
and found the small balsam-needle pillow and put it under my neck.
Then I felt for my pistol alongside my leg and for the electric
torch and then unscrewed the top of the flask of gin.''
</P>
<P>
   The deadening monotony of the narrative seems to be either a
means to hide from any lucid self-reflection, or the author finds
himself so blindingly unhappy that he has turned into a fool.
</P>
<P>
   He spends his days fussing over Miss Mary and hunting and toying
with his mistress.
</P>
<P>
   The plot revolves around Mary's determination to shoot a
particular lion. They have hunted him for six months, a great,
black-maned wily creature with a scarred paw. He has been hunted
before.
</P>
<P>
   It is an emotional affair, mired in disappointment of their
failure to outwit him, then Mary's sulking anger that, after all
her lion dreams of a clean kill and a stunning conquest, she nicks
him in the flank. He is brought down by a shot to the spine from
her husband as the lion makes for deep cover.
</P>
<P>
   Finally there is the emptiness once the lion is duly
photographed and skinned and marinated for supper and prowls the
camp no more at night.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Hemingway writes of the same safari in her autobiography,
``How It Was.'' Interestingly, what her husband called her
``obsession'' with the lion takes up just two pages. She mostly
writes of how gay they were, playing together in Africa like
puppies. Her chapter on East Africa comprises the same characters
and events, but with vastly different perspective. In
autobiography, she at least doesn't come off as vapid and petulant,
as Hemingway writes her.
</P>
<P>
   In the new book, the happiness of the narrator's relationship
with Mary seems strained and shallow. There is too much talk about
it, as if they are trying to buoy the notion of it with their
simpering proclamations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just go now and be good lovers and friends and love
Africa because it is. I love it more than anything,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She tries to please him as a child would her father, and he
parents his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The most telling moment of their relationship comes when Mary
kills a hartebeest she spots from the hunting car. He strokes his
Kitten and she reasons, ``Well, we needed meat and I saw the best
kind of meat we could get ... I saw him myself and just Charo and I
stalked him and I shot him and now will you love me and not go off
alone by yourself in your head?''
</P>
<P>
   Baby talk overpowers the dialogue. Mary says ``Blessed Big
Kitten, will we have a sort of normal day tomorrow and not all
these mysterious and bad things?''
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway values most in his wife those attributes that mirror
his own _ her love of hunting and fishing and of Africa, or the
idea of her as a small creature in need of his manly shield.
</P>
<P>
   The book also weakly chronicles his relationship with a young
woman named Debba from the Wakamba tribe. Mary refers to her as his
fiancee. She is unconcerned and even seems to encourage the affair
with some condescension. The most compelling writing in the book
comes when he describes the creatures he lives among and hunts.
When Mary finally fells her lion, he kneels by the corpse with its
yellow eyes as the flies gather and speaks softly to it in Spanish
while he strokes its hide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy that before he died he had lain on the high yellow
rounded mound with his tail down and his great paws comfortable
before him and looked off across his country to the blue forest and
the high white snows of the big Mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``True at First Light'' is at least worth reading for the cast
of safari characters who are a patchwork quilt of tribes and
religions and superstitions. Most notable is the cloying,
obsequious Game Department Informer, who lurks outside the tent and
coughs importantly to herald his arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway writes that Africa, as old as it is, makes all people
into children. There are rhythms to life there that don't exist
anymore in Paris or Pamplona. Life is dictated more by the rising
and setting of the sun and the bright moon and the immediacy of
killing one's own supper.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this explains a world-weary writer's desire to go there
near the end of his life and rest his mind for a while.

UPSTATE NEW YORK PAPER WINS AWARD FOR ON-LINE EDITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The 3-year-old Web-based newspaper of the Albany Times
Union, timesunion.com, has been named the best North American
on-line newspaper in its circulation class by the Newspaper
Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   Citing its ``superior design, in-depth content and focus on
interactivity and community,'' the judges on Friday gave the top
prize in the Digital Edge Awards to timesunion.com at the
Connections '99 electronic media conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's appropriate that this award is named the `Edgie,' because
Patti Hart and her staff at timesunion.com have developed a cutting
edge, innovative and original site on the Web,'' said Jeff Cohen,
editor of the Times Union. ``In an age when every person who owns a
computer can be a publisher, we've distinguished ourselves by
creating an easy-to-navigate site loaded with local content created
in our newsroom.''
</P>
<P>
   The Best Online Newspaper Site Edgies also were presented to The
New York Times in large markets (circulation more than 150,000),
and in small markets (circulation less than 75,000), to
SearchColorado.com, a joint project among several Colorado
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The Times Union competed in medium market category (circulation
between 75,000 and 150,000).
</P>
<P>
   Eleven other newspapers received awards. In 1997, timesunion.com
received an Edgie for its Capital Cars search engine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased that the judges gave us the same kind of
positive feedback that the visitors to our Web site have given
us,'' said Hart, the on-line editor of timesunion.com. ``People
like our content, they like our interactivity and they keep coming
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Hart accepted the award on behalf of the Times Union at a
luncheon in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   This was the second major award for journalists of the Times
Union in a year. The Newspaper of Distinction Award, presented to
the best newspaper in its circulation class, was award to the Times
Union by the New York State Associated Press Association last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've developed into a multifaceted media company,'' said
David P. White, publisher of the Times Union. ``Our influence
begins in the newspaper and extends to multiple communications
platforms from timesunion.com to SourceLine to trade shows and
specialty publications. The key to our success is an innovative and
dedicated staff.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times Union is owned by the Hearst Newspapers. Its
full-service news Web site is at http://www.timesunion.com.

   WRESTLER. Jenni Carlson. Tonya Evinger of Odessa, Mo., is the
only high school wrestler on the 18-woman World Team and will
represent the United States in international competition. And
seeing as how she's still a lanky, slim 18-year-old, Evinger has to
be considered an early favorite for the 2004 Olympics, when women's
wrestling will debut as a demonstration sport. ``Assuming she keeps
the same attitude, she should be a dominant force in U.S.
wrestling,'' said Mike Machholz, who coaches one of the nation's
few women's college wrestling teams at Missouri Valley College in
Marshall.

<P>
   When Catharina Svanborg and her research associates began mixing
mothers' milk and cancer cells together seven years ago, she wasn't
looking for a cure for cancer; she was after a way to fight germs.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the physician and immunologist at Lund University
in Sweden has discovered that a previously taken-for-granted
component of ordinary human breast milk compels cancer cells _
every type of cancer cell tested _ to die.
</P>
<P>
   Now Svanborg must prove her discovery, demonstrating to wary
scientists that her surprising find is for real. So far, it hasn't
been easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extremely important observation, interesting and
provocative,'' says breast-cancer researcher David Salomon of the
National Cancer Institute. ``But it's novel, and novelty always
runs the risk of challenging the current dogma. A lot of times you
run up against a brick wall of people who have tunnel vision.''
</P>
<P>
   It all began seven years ago, when her student Anders Hakansson
rushed into Svanborg's office with perplexing news. He had been
experimenting with human cancer cells, microbes and mothers' milk.
(Cancer cells make popular experimental models because they come in
standardized lab strains. In many important respects they behave
just like other human cells in lab dishes.)
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to pinpoint how the milk blocks bacteria from
infecting other cells. But the cancer cells in this experiment were
acting up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their volume was decreasing,'' Hakansson recalls. ``Their
nuclei were shrinking. Something was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   When Svanborg sat down at the microscope, she diagnosed the
problem immediately. ``The cancer cells are committing suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Cells commit suicide all the time, a phenomenon called
apoptosis, in which the body rids itself of old or unnecessary
cells. They simply fall apart and are recycled.
</P>
<P>
   For cancer cells, however, suicide is rare indeed. Their
defining characteristic is uncontrolled reproduction. Yet somehow,
the breast milk induced these cancer cells to take their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   Could the discovery be developed into a cancer cure?
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, much of Svanborg's work has prepared her for this
specific research. She and her group had studied the nature and
function of epithelial cells, the gut-lining cells that come into
contact with breast milk in nursing infants. And they had
experimented with mother's milk many times.
</P>
<P>
   They had shown that it does a terrific job of blocking infection
by pneumococcus bacteria, the cause of pneumonia, and that
breast-fed children suffer significantly fewer ear and upper
respiratory tract infections than babies who don't nurse.
</P>
<P>
   And her team had already done much of the homework that would be
needed. They had tracked down studies showing that breast milk also
protects against cancer. She wondered what accounted for that
discrepancy. Now she had at hand the results that might provide an
answer.
</P>
<P>
   It took more than two years before her team felt ready to share
its discovery with the rest of the world. In August 1995 they
announced that breast milk kills cancer cells and pinpointed the
killer, which turned out to be the protein alpha-lactalbumin
(alpha-lac for short). It helps produce lactose, the sugar found in
milk.
</P>
<P>
   Svanborg and her colleagues discovered that the protein was
performing the decidedly unprotein-like trick of changing its shape
_ and that it was persuading cancer cells to commit suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery also suggested a possible explanation of how
breast milk protects against cancer. Perhaps, Svanborg reasoned,
the errant cells that give rise to malignancies first show up in
infants. The key is breakneck reproduction, a characteristic of the
cells lining an infant's gut. Some of these cells may proliferate
out of control. That's called cancer. Or they may never fully
mature or stabilize, lurking in the system like time bombs, ever
ready to burst forth into tumors.
</P>
<P>
   Transformed alpha-lac ``targets not only cancer cells but all
kinds of immature, rapidly growing cells, and leaves mature, stable
cells alone,'' Svanborg says.
</P>
<P>
   Alpha-lac, then, may be conducting surveillance missions within
the nursing child, rooting out potentially malignant cells and
encouraging properly growing cells to mature. Because the lining of
the gut, a prime meeting point between the inside of the body and
the hazards of the outside world, is a headquarters of the immune
system, the vigilance may help the child's immune defenses develop.
</P>
<P>
   John Stevens, a vice president of grants at the American Cancer
Society, took notice. After reading the Svanborg team's research
paper, he made a journey to Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had not known of Lund University before, but we found
Catharina and her team to be very talented researchers, very
dedicated, and their work fascinating.''
</P>
<P>
   A $200,000 grant made Svanborg's the only non-American lab with
ACS support. So she got back to work with renewed enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The grant gave us recognition,'' Svanborg says. ``We came into
this from nowhere, and the cancer society gave us the stamp of
quality. Now the weight was on us to prove that this is real and
reproducible.''
</P>
<P>
   That effort has taken another four years. In January, Svanborg
released the team's most recent findings, bolstered by the work of
new collaborators, including researchers from the renowned
Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and Oxford University in England.
</P>
<P>
   The studies explain how transformed alpha-lac snuffs out cancer
and other risky cells, and characterizes the protein down to the
molecular level. And they announced that not only does it kill
cells, it eliminates pneumococcus bacteria, too. Svanborg, with her
longstanding interest in infectious disease, is as excited about
this finding as any. She envisions using alpha-lac as a tonic to
stop infections before they begin.
</P>
<P>
   The team has given the new protein a name: HAMLET for Human
Alpha-lactalbumin Made LEthal to Tumor cells.
</P>
<P>
   They now know just how the protein changes into a cancer
assassin. One key is the acid content of its surroundings. When
Svanborg initially prepared milk to pour over cells, she added acid
to the solution, hoping to separate out the microbe blockers.
Little did she know that this acid bath, like some magic potion,
would transform the well-mannered alpha-lac into HAMLET.
</P>
<P>
   But acid alone wasn't enough. Another mysterious factor was
needed. That, too, turned out to be a component of the milk itself.
(The lab has not yet made its identity public).
</P>
<P>
   Now that the team can generate genetically engineered HAMLET,
they can make changes in it, helping them learn the function of its
structural parts.
</P>
<P>
   The first step is to test HAMLET as a tumor killer in animals.
Svanborg and her team hope that because HAMLET is a naturally
occurring substance, it might not be toxic like so many other
cancer drugs. They've already tried it in mice, who tolerate very
high doses with no side effects.
</P>
<P>
   If animal tests go well, the next trials will be with humans.
That can take years. And then, Svanborg says, ``A major
pharmaceutical company must become convinced that this is worth
their investment. But if we can demonstrate that HAMLET works, I
think no major company would be able to refuse.''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Ever wonder how Post-it notes work?
</P>
<P>
   How about Scotch tape?
</P>
<P>
   There are two kinds of secrets about adhesives. One is the
chemical and industrial recipes for how to make the best ones.
</P>
<P>
   The other kind of secret is the deeper kind: the physical
mechanism that explains how adhesives work. No one really knows
that secret, surprisingly enough _ maybe not even 3M, the
manufacturer Post-it notes.
</P>
<P>
   We live in an age when everything from space-shuttle engines to
disposable diapers are strewn with adhesives. Yet we still don't
know exactly what makes them stick.
</P>
<P>
   Or do we? A couple of French physicists have recently come up
with a new idea. Their hypothesis applies especially to adhesives
like those used in Scotch tape and Post-its, the kind that stick
immediately when you push them against a surface. (Glues, which
have to dry to become sticky and, in the process, undergo a
physical or chemical transformation, are a whole different kettle
of polymers.)
</P>
<P>
   The key to pressure-sensitive adhesives, say Ludwik Leibler and
Cyprien Gay, are bubbles: microscopic bits of partial vacuum that
act like suction cups to keep the sticky stuff stuck.
</P>
<P>
   The lab Leibler directs and Gay works at resides at Elf Atochem,
another of the world's leading adhesive manufacturers. But the two
physicists are also affiliated with the French National Center for
Scientific Research, which explains why they have the leisure time
to look into the basic physics of adhesion.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that nothing is known about the subject, Gay says.
Researchers discovered more than a century ago that there was an
electrostatic attraction, called the van der Waals force, between
any two surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   Positively charged particles on one surface tend to be attracted
to negatively charged particles on the other, with the result that
the two surfaces as a whole attract each other. Press your finger
flat against the surface of a table and then pull it away: the
slight stick is the van der Waals force.
</P>
<P>
   But it is very slight. The van der Waals force is roughly a ten-
thousandth of the force exerted by an everyday tape. Adhesives have
something else going for them: They are all made of polymers.
</P>
<P>
   Polymers are chain molecules, like spaghetti, except that
relative to their own diameter they are even longer than spaghetti
strands. And, like spaghetti, they get tangled up.
</P>
<P>
   Polymer adhesives are viscoelastic. It takes a lot of work to
pull them apart _ about 100 times, physicists have calculated, what
it would take to unstick something held by van der Waals attraction
alone.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that even the aforementioned hundredfold increase
cannot completely explain the stickiness of real adhesives. This
has been brought home to researchers in the past decade, as they
have now learned how to measure stickiness precisely.
</P>
<P>
   In such experiments, a surface is coated with an adhesive, a
metal probe is pressed against the adhesive, and the probe is then
pulled away. It's like using your finger to see if a surface is
sticky, only the laboratory apparatus is sensitive enough to
measure precisely what force the probe has to exert to pull away at
a steady speed.
</P>
<P>
   To break free of a good adhesive, it turns out, a probe or a
finger typically has to give a brief hard yank at first, followed
by a long, steady, but less forceful pull _ that is, the force
curve shows a sharp peak and then a long plateau.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists have had no good explanation for this familiar
pattern, Gay says. Nor could they explain why the overall adhesion
energy should be so much larger than that accounted for by van der
Waals and viscoelastic forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``With viscoelasticity you get about a hundred times more than
from the van der Waals force alone,'' Gay says. ``But if you
actually measure the energy of an adhesive, you get something
10,000 times more. That's the great problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, physicists are missing a factor of 100; they
understand only about 1 percent of the reason why Scotch tape
sticks as well as it does.
</P>
<P>
   Leibler and Gay think bubbles may account for the other 99
percent. The bubbles arise because the surface of Scotch or any
other tape is not as smooth as it looks to the naked eye.
</P>
<P>
   Under a microscope the adhesive becomes a rugged landscape of
mountains a few ten-thousandths of an inch high, separated by val
leys a few thousandths of an inch across.
</P>
<P>
   When a metal probe presses down onto that landscape, the
mountains and the passes between them come into contact with the
metal _ but not the floors of the valleys. Lens-shaped bubbles of
air get trapped there, like patches of ground fog.
</P>
<P>
   When the probe is pulled away again, those bubbles swell in
volume. At first the passes are still blocked, and no air can
parent than the physics. flow into them from the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   Because the same amount of air is now filling a bigger volume,
the pressure inside the bubbles falls much lower than it is outside
_ just like in a suction cup.
</P>
<P>
   Picture thousands of tiny suction cups gripping a surface as you
try to rip off a recalcitrant strip of duct or packing tape: This
is the peak of the adhesive's force curve. As you keep pulling,
though, the bubbles widen and start to merge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now all the valleys are connected to one another and to the
outside,'' Gay says, ``and the air comes rushing in.''
</P>
<P>
   The nontechnical term for this moment is ``pop.''
</P>
<P>
   As the air-filled valleys continue to grow, the shrinking
mountains of adhesive become islands that soon stretch into long
fibers.
</P>
<P>
   The fibers still cling to the surface, in Leibler and Gay's
model, thanks to a second population of bubbles _ the ones that
form in the tiny valleys on the surface of the metal probe, which
isn't smooth either. Only when those bubbles pop, too, or the
viscoelastic fibers snap in the middle, does the adhesive
relinquish its grip.
</P>
<P>
   Though he has reason to be proud of his bubble theory, Ludwik
Leibler can step back from his work and see the big picture:
``People have made very good adhesives without understanding
bubbles.''
</P>
<P>
   Enough said.

   We live in an age when everything from space-shuttle engines to
disposable diapers are strewn with adhesives. Yet we still don't
know exactly what makes them stick.
</P>
<P>
   Or do we? A couple of French physicists have recently come up
with a new idea. Their hypothesis applies especially to adhesives
like those used in Scotch tape and Post-its, the kind that stick
immediately when you push them against a surface. (Glues, which
have to dry to become sticky and, in the process, undergo a
physical or chemical transformation, are a whole different kettle
of polymers.)
</P>
<P>
   The key to pressure-sensitive adhesives, say Ludwik Leibler and
Cyprien Gay, are bubbles: microscopic bits of partial vacuum that
act like suction cups to keep the sticky stuff stuck.
</P>
<P>
   The lab Leibler directs and Gay works at resides at Elf Atochem,
another of the world's leading adhesive manufacturers. But the two
physicists are also affiliated with the French National Center for
Scientific Research, which explains why they have the leisure time
to look into the basic physics of adhesion.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that nothing is known about the subject, Gay says.
Researchers discovered more than a century ago that there was an
electrostatic attraction, called the van der Waals force, between
any two surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   Positively charged particles on one surface tend to be attracted
to negatively charged particles on the other, with the result that
the two surfaces as a whole attract each other. Press your finger
flat against the surface of a table and then pull it away: the
slight stick is the van der Waals force.
</P>
<P>
   But it is very slight. The van der Waals force is roughly a ten-
thousandth of the force exerted by an everyday tape. Adhesives have
something else going for them: They are all made of polymers.
</P>
<P>
   Polymers are chain molecules, like spaghetti, except that
relative to their own diameter they are even longer than spaghetti
strands. And, like spaghetti, they get tangled up.
</P>
<P>
   Polymer adhesives are viscoelastic. It takes a lot of work to
pull them apart _ about 100 times, physicists have calculated, what
it would take to unstick something held by van der Waals attraction
alone.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that even the aforementioned hundredfold increase
cannot completely explain the stickiness of real adhesives. This
has been brought home to researchers in the past decade, as they
have now learned how to measure stickiness precisely.
</P>
<P>
   In such experiments, a surface is coated with an adhesive, a
metal probe is pressed against the adhesive, and the probe is then
pulled away. It's like using your finger to see if a surface is
sticky, only the laboratory apparatus is sensitive enough to
measure precisely what force the probe has to exert to pull away at
a steady speed.
</P>
<P>
   To break free of a good adhesive, it turns out, a probe or a
finger typically has to give a brief hard yank at first, followed
by a long, steady, but less forceful pull _ that is, the force
curve shows a sharp peak and then a long plateau.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists have had no good explanation for this familiar
pattern, Gay says. Nor could they explain why the overall adhesion
energy should be so much larger than that accounted for by van der
Waals and viscoelastic forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``With viscoelasticity you get about a hundred times more than
from the van der Waals force alone,'' Gay says. ``But if you
actually measure the energy of an adhesive, you get something
10,000 times more. That's the great problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, physicists are missing a factor of 100; they
understand only about 1 percent of the reason why Scotch tape
sticks as well as it does.
</P>
<P>
   Leibler and Gay think bubbles may account for the other 99
percent. The bubbles arise because the surface of Scotch or any
other tape is not as smooth as it looks to the naked eye.
</P>
<P>
   Under a microscope the adhesive becomes a rugged landscape of
mountains a few ten-thousandths of an inch high, separated by val
leys a few thousandths of an inch across.
</P>
<P>
   When a metal probe presses down onto that landscape, the
mountains and the passes between them come into contact with the
metal _ but not the floors of the valleys. Lens-shaped bubbles of
air get trapped there, like patches of ground fog.
</P>
<P>
   When the probe is pulled away again, those bubbles swell in
volume. At first the passes are still blocked, and no air can
parent than the physics. flow into them from the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   Because the same amount of air is now filling a bigger volume,
the pressure inside the bubbles falls much lower than it is outside
_ just like in a suction cup.
</P>
<P>
   Picture thousands of tiny suction cups gripping a surface as you
try to rip off a recalcitrant strip of duct or packing tape: This
is the peak of the adhesive's force curve. As you keep pulling,
though, the bubbles widen and start to merge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now all the valleys are connected to one another and to the
outside,'' Gay says, ``and the air comes rushing in.''
</P>
<P>
   The nontechnical term for this moment is ``pop.''
</P>
<P>
   As the air-filled valleys continue to grow, the shrinking
mountains of adhesive become islands that soon stretch into long
fibers.
</P>
<P>
   The fibers still cling to the surface, in Leibler and Gay's
model, thanks to a second population of bubbles _ the ones that
form in the tiny valleys on the surface of the metal probe, which
isn't smooth either. Only when those bubbles pop, too, or the
viscoelastic fibers snap in the middle, does the adhesive
relinquish its grip.
</P>
<P>
   Though he has reason to be proud of his bubble theory, Ludwik
Leibler can step back from his work and see the big picture:
``People have made very good adhesives without understanding
bubbles.''
</P>
<P>
   Enough said.

<P>
   When Catharina Svanborg and her research associates began mixing
mothers' milk and cancer cells together seven years ago, she wasn't
looking for a cure for cancer; she was after a way to fight germs.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the physician and immunologist at Lund University
in Sweden has discovered that a previously taken-for-granted
component of ordinary human breast milk compels cancer cells _
every type of cancer cell tested _ to die.
</P>
<P>
   Now Svanborg must prove her discovery, demonstrating to wary
scientists that her surprising find is for real. So far, it hasn't
been easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extremely important observation, interesting and
provocative,'' says breast-cancer researcher David Salomon of the
National Cancer Institute. ``But it's novel, and novelty always
runs the risk of challenging the current dogma. A lot of times you
run up against a brick wall of people who have tunnel vision.''
</P>
<P>
   It all began seven years ago, when her student Anders Hakansson
rushed into Svanborg's office with perplexing news. He had been
experimenting with human cancer cells, microbes and mothers' milk.
(Cancer cells make popular experimental models because they come in
standardized lab strains. In many important respects they behave
just like other human cells in lab dishes.)
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to pinpoint how the milk blocks bacteria from
infecting other cells. But the cancer cells in this experiment were
acting up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their volume was decreasing,'' Hakansson recalls. ``Their
nuclei were shrinking. Something was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   When Svanborg sat down at the microscope, she diagnosed the
problem immediately. ``The cancer cells are committing suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Cells commit suicide all the time, a phenomenon called
apoptosis, in which the body rids itself of old or unnecessary
cells. They simply fall apart and are recycled.
</P>
<P>
   For cancer cells, however, suicide is rare indeed. Their
defining characteristic is uncontrolled reproduction. Yet somehow,
the breast milk induced these cancer cells to take their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   Could the discovery be developed into a cancer cure?
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, much of Svanborg's work has prepared her for this
specific research. She and her group had studied the nature and
function of epithelial cells, the gut-lining cells that come into
contact with breast milk in nursing infants. And they had
experimented with mother's milk many times.
</P>
<P>
   They had shown that it does a terrific job of blocking infection
by pneumococcus bacteria, the cause of pneumonia, and that
breast-fed children suffer significantly fewer ear and upper
respiratory tract infections than babies who don't nurse.
</P>
<P>
   And her team had already done much of the homework that would be
needed. They had tracked down studies showing that breast milk also
protects against cancer. She wondered what accounted for that
discrepancy. Now she had at hand the results that might provide an
answer.
</P>
<P>
   It took more than two years before her team felt ready to share
its discovery with the rest of the world. In August 1995 they
announced that breast milk kills cancer cells and pinpointed the
killer, which turned out to be the protein alpha-lactalbumin
(alpha-lac for short). It helps produce lactose, the sugar found in
milk.
</P>
<P>
   Svanborg and her colleagues discovered that the protein was
performing the decidedly unprotein-like trick of changing its shape
_ and that it was persuading cancer cells to commit suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery also suggested a possible explanation of how
breast milk protects against cancer. Perhaps, Svanborg reasoned,
the errant cells that give rise to malignancies first show up in
infants. The key is breakneck reproduction, a characteristic of the
cells lining an infant's gut. Some of these cells may proliferate
out of control. That's called cancer. Or they may never fully
mature or stabilize, lurking in the system like time bombs, ever
ready to burst forth into tumors.
</P>
<P>
   Transformed alpha-lac ``targets not only cancer cells but all
kinds of immature, rapidly growing cells, and leaves mature, stable
cells alone,'' Svanborg says.
</P>
<P>
   Alpha-lac, then, may be conducting surveillance missions within
the nursing child, rooting out potentially malignant cells and
encouraging properly growing cells to mature. Because the lining of
the gut, a prime meeting point between the inside of the body and
the hazards of the outside world, is a headquarters of the immune
system, the vigilance may help the child's immune defenses develop.
</P>
<P>
   John Stevens, a vice president of grants at the American Cancer
Society, took notice. After reading the Svanborg team's research
paper, he made a journey to Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had not known of Lund University before, but we found
Catharina and her team to be very talented researchers, very
dedicated, and their work fascinating.''
</P>
<P>
   A $200,000 grant made Svanborg's the only non-American lab with
ACS support. So she got back to work with renewed enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The grant gave us recognition,'' Svanborg says. ``We came into
this from nowhere, and the cancer society gave us the stamp of
quality. Now the weight was on us to prove that this is real and
reproducible.''
</P>
<P>
   That effort has taken another four years. In January, Svanborg
released the team's most recent findings, bolstered by the work of
new collaborators, including researchers from the renowned
Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and Oxford University in England.
</P>
<P>
   The studies explain how transformed alpha-lac snuffs out cancer
and other risky cells, and characterizes the protein down to the
molecular level. And they announced that not only does it kill
cells, it eliminates pneumococcus bacteria, too. Svanborg, with her
longstanding interest in infectious disease, is as excited about
this finding as any. She envisions using alpha-lac as a tonic to
stop infections before they begin.
</P>
<P>
   The team has given the new protein a name: HAMLET for Human
Alpha-lactalbumin Made LEthal to Tumor cells.
</P>
<P>
   They now know just how the protein changes into a cancer
assassin. One key is the acid content of its surroundings. When
Svanborg initially prepared milk to pour over cells, she added acid
to the solution, hoping to separate out the microbe blockers.
Little did she know that this acid bath, like some magic potion,
would transform the well-mannered alpha-lac into HAMLET.
</P>
<P>
   But acid alone wasn't enough. Another mysterious factor was
needed. That, too, turned out to be a component of the milk itself.
(The lab has not yet made its identity public).
</P>
<P>
   Now that the team can generate genetically engineered HAMLET,
they can make changes in it, helping them learn the function of its
structural parts.
</P>
<P>
   The first step is to test HAMLET as a tumor killer in animals.
Svanborg and her team hope that because HAMLET is a naturally
occurring substance, it might not be toxic like so many other
cancer drugs. They've already tried it in mice, who tolerate very
high doses with no side effects.
</P>
<P>
   If animal tests go well, the next trials will be with humans.
That can take years. And then, Svanborg says, ``A major
pharmaceutical company must become convinced that this is worth
their investment. But if we can demonstrate that HAMLET works, I
think no major company would be able to refuse.''

<P>
   Ever wonder how Post-it notes work?
</P>
<P>
   How about Scotch tape?
</P>
<P>
   There are two kinds of secrets about adhesives. One is the
chemical and industrial recipes for how to make the best ones.
</P>
<P>
   The other kind of secret is the deeper kind: the physical
mechanism that explains how adhesives work. No one really knows
that secret, surprisingly enough _ maybe not even 3M, the
manufacturer Post-it notes.
</P>
<P>
   We live in an age when everything from space-shuttle engines to
disposable diapers are strewn with adhesives. Yet we still don't
know exactly what makes them stick.
</P>
<P>
   Or do we? A couple of French physicists have recently come up
with a new idea. Their hypothesis applies especially to adhesives
like those used in Scotch tape and Post-its, the kind that stick
immediately when you push them against a surface. (Glues, which
have to dry to become sticky and, in the process, undergo a
physical or chemical transformation, are a whole different kettle
of polymers.)
</P>
<P>
   The key to pressure-sensitive adhesives, say Ludwik Leibler and
Cyprien Gay, are bubbles: microscopic bits of partial vacuum that
act like suction cups to keep the sticky stuff stuck.
</P>
<P>
   The lab Leibler directs and Gay works at resides at Elf Atochem,
another of the world's leading adhesive manufacturers. But the two
physicists are also affiliated with the French National Center for
Scientific Research, which explains why they have the leisure time
to look into the basic physics of adhesion.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that nothing is known about the subject, Gay says.
Researchers discovered more than a century ago that there was an
electrostatic attraction, called the van der Waals force, between
any two surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   Positively charged particles on one surface tend to be attracted
to negatively charged particles on the other, with the result that
the two surfaces as a whole attract each other. Press your finger
flat against the surface of a table and then pull it away: the
slight stick is the van der Waals force.
</P>
<P>
   But it is very slight. The van der Waals force is roughly a ten-
thousandth of the force exerted by an everyday tape. Adhesives have
something else going for them: They are all made of polymers.
</P>
<P>
   Polymers are chain molecules, like spaghetti, except that
relative to their own diameter they are even longer than spaghetti
strands. And, like spaghetti, they get tangled up.
</P>
<P>
   Polymer adhesives are viscoelastic. It takes a lot of work to
pull them apart _ about 100 times, physicists have calculated, what
it would take to unstick something held by van der Waals attraction
alone.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that even the aforementioned hundredfold increase
cannot completely explain the stickiness of real adhesives. This
has been brought home to researchers in the past decade, as they
have now learned how to measure stickiness precisely.
</P>
<P>
   In such experiments, a surface is coated with an adhesive, a
metal probe is pressed against the adhesive, and the probe is then
pulled away. It's like using your finger to see if a surface is
sticky, only the laboratory apparatus is sensitive enough to
measure precisely what force the probe has to exert to pull away at
a steady speed.
</P>
<P>
   To break free of a good adhesive, it turns out, a probe or a
finger typically has to give a brief hard yank at first, followed
by a long, steady, but less forceful pull _ that is, the force
curve shows a sharp peak and then a long plateau.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists have had no good explanation for this familiar
pattern, Gay says. Nor could they explain why the overall adhesion
energy should be so much larger than that accounted for by van der
Waals and viscoelastic forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``With viscoelasticity you get about a hundred times more than
from the van der Waals force alone,'' Gay says. ``But if you
actually measure the energy of an adhesive, you get something
10,000 times more. That's the great problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, physicists are missing a factor of 100; they
understand only about 1 percent of the reason why Scotch tape
sticks as well as it does.
</P>
<P>
   Leibler and Gay think bubbles may account for the other 99
percent. The bubbles arise because the surface of Scotch or any
other tape is not as smooth as it looks to the naked eye.
</P>
<P>
   Under a microscope the adhesive becomes a rugged landscape of
mountains a few ten-thousandths of an inch high, separated by val
leys a few thousandths of an inch across.
</P>
<P>
   When a metal probe presses down onto that landscape, the
mountains and the passes between them come into contact with the
metal _ but not the floors of the valleys. Lens-shaped bubbles of
air get trapped there, like patches of ground fog.
</P>
<P>
   When the probe is pulled away again, those bubbles swell in
volume. At first the passes are still blocked, and no air can
parent than the physics. flow into them from the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   Because the same amount of air is now filling a bigger volume,
the pressure inside the bubbles falls much lower than it is outside
_ just like in a suction cup.
</P>
<P>
   Picture thousands of tiny suction cups gripping a surface as you
try to rip off a recalcitrant strip of duct or packing tape: This
is the peak of the adhesive's force curve. As you keep pulling,
though, the bubbles widen and start to merge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now all the valleys are connected to one another and to the
outside,'' Gay says, ``and the air comes rushing in.''
</P>
<P>
   The nontechnical term for this moment is ``pop.''
</P>
<P>
   As the air-filled valleys continue to grow, the shrinking
mountains of adhesive become islands that soon stretch into long
fibers.
</P>
<P>
   The fibers still cling to the surface, in Leibler and Gay's
model, thanks to a second population of bubbles _ the ones that
form in the tiny valleys on the surface of the metal probe, which
isn't smooth either. Only when those bubbles pop, too, or the
viscoelastic fibers snap in the middle, does the adhesive
relinquish its grip.
</P>
<P>
   Though he has reason to be proud of his bubble theory, Ludwik
Leibler can step back from his work and see the big picture:
``People have made very good adhesives without understanding
bubbles.''
</P>
<P>
   Enough said.

<P>
   When Catharina Svanborg and her research associates began mixing
mothers' milk and cancer cells together seven years ago, she wasn't
looking for a cure for cancer; she was after a way to fight germs.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the physician and immunologist at Lund University
in Sweden has discovered that a previously taken-for-granted
component of ordinary human breast milk compels cancer cells _
every type of cancer cell tested _ to die.
</P>
<P>
   Now Svanborg must prove her discovery, demonstrating to wary
scientists that her surprising find is for real. So far, it hasn't
been easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extremely important observation, interesting and
provocative,'' says breast-cancer researcher David Salomon of the
National Cancer Institute. ``But it's novel, and novelty always
runs the risk of challenging the current dogma. A lot of times you
run up against a brick wall of people who have tunnel vision.''
</P>
<P>
   It all began seven years ago, when her student Anders Hakansson
rushed into Svanborg's office with perplexing news. He had been
experimenting with human cancer cells, microbes and mothers' milk.
(Cancer cells make popular experimental models because they come in
standardized lab strains. In many important respects they behave
just like other human cells in lab dishes.)
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to pinpoint how the milk blocks bacteria from
infecting other cells. But the cancer cells in this experiment were
acting up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their volume was decreasing,'' Hakansson recalls. ``Their
nuclei were shrinking. Something was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   When Svanborg sat down at the microscope, she diagnosed the
problem immediately. ``The cancer cells are committing suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Cells commit suicide all the time, a phenomenon called
apoptosis, in which the body rids itself of old or unnecessary
cells. They simply fall apart and are recycled.
</P>
<P>
   For cancer cells, however, suicide is rare indeed. Their
defining characteristic is uncontrolled reproduction. Yet somehow,
the breast milk induced these cancer cells to take their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   Could the discovery be developed into a cancer cure?
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, much of Svanborg's work has prepared her for this
specific research. She and her group had studied the nature and
function of epithelial cells, the gut-lining cells that come into
contact with breast milk in nursing infants. And they had
experimented with mother's milk many times.
</P>
<P>
   They had shown that it does a terrific job of blocking infection
by pneumococcus bacteria, the cause of pneumonia, and that
breast-fed children suffer significantly fewer ear and upper
respiratory tract infections than babies who don't nurse.
</P>
<P>
   And her team had already done much of the homework that would be
needed. They had tracked down studies showing that breast milk also
protects against cancer. She wondered what accounted for that
discrepancy. Now she had at hand the results that might provide an
answer.
</P>
<P>
   It took more than two years before her team felt ready to share
its discovery with the rest of the world. In August 1995 they
announced that breast milk kills cancer cells and pinpointed the
killer, which turned out to be the protein alpha-lactalbumin
(alpha-lac for short). It helps produce lactose, the sugar found in
milk.
</P>
<P>
   Svanborg and her colleagues discovered that the protein was
performing the decidedly unprotein-like trick of changing its shape
_ and that it was persuading cancer cells to commit suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery also suggested a possible explanation of how
breast milk protects against cancer. Perhaps, Svanborg reasoned,
the errant cells that give rise to malignancies first show up in
infants. The key is breakneck reproduction, a characteristic of the
cells lining an infant's gut. Some of these cells may proliferate
out of control. That's called cancer. Or they may never fully
mature or stabilize, lurking in the system like time bombs, ever
ready to burst forth into tumors.
</P>
<P>
   Transformed alpha-lac ``targets not only cancer cells but all
kinds of immature, rapidly growing cells, and leaves mature, stable
cells alone,'' Svanborg says.
</P>
<P>
   Alpha-lac, then, may be conducting surveillance missions within
the nursing child, rooting out potentially malignant cells and
encouraging properly growing cells to mature. Because the lining of
the gut, a prime meeting point between the inside of the body and
the hazards of the outside world, is a headquarters of the immune
system, the vigilance may help the child's immune defenses develop.
</P>
<P>
   John Stevens, a vice president of grants at the American Cancer
Society, took notice. After reading the Svanborg team's research
paper, he made a journey to Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had not known of Lund University before, but we found
Catharina and her team to be very talented researchers, very
dedicated, and their work fascinating.''
</P>
<P>
   A $200,000 grant made Svanborg's the only non-American lab with
ACS support. So she got back to work with renewed enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The grant gave us recognition,'' Svanborg says. ``We came into
this from nowhere, and the cancer society gave us the stamp of
quality. Now the weight was on us to prove that this is real and
reproducible.''
</P>
<P>
   That effort has taken another four years. In January, Svanborg
released the team's most recent findings, bolstered by the work of
new collaborators, including researchers from the renowned
Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and Oxford University in England.
</P>
<P>
   The studies explain how transformed alpha-lac snuffs out cancer
and other risky cells, and characterizes the protein down to the
molecular level. And they announced that not only does it kill
cells, it eliminates pneumococcus bacteria, too. Svanborg, with her
longstanding interest in infectious disease, is as excited about
this finding as any. She envisions using alpha-lac as a tonic to
stop infections before they begin.
</P>
<P>
   The team has given the new protein a name: HAMLET for Human
Alpha-lactalbumin Made LEthal to Tumor cells.
</P>
<P>
   They now know just how the protein changes into a cancer
assassin. One key is the acid content of its surroundings. When
Svanborg initially prepared milk to pour over cells, she added acid
to the solution, hoping to separate out the microbe blockers.
Little did she know that this acid bath, like some magic potion,
would transform the well-mannered alpha-lac into HAMLET.
</P>
<P>
   But acid alone wasn't enough. Another mysterious factor was
needed. That, too, turned out to be a component of the milk itself.
(The lab has not yet made its identity public).
</P>
<P>
   Now that the team can generate genetically engineered HAMLET,
they can make changes in it, helping them learn the function of its
structural parts.
</P>
<P>
   The first step is to test HAMLET as a tumor killer in animals.
Svanborg and her team hope that because HAMLET is a naturally
occurring substance, it might not be toxic like so many other
cancer drugs. They've already tried it in mice, who tolerate very
high doses with no side effects.
</P>
<P>
   If animal tests go well, the next trials will be with humans.
That can take years. And then, Svanborg says, ``A major
pharmaceutical company must become convinced that this is worth
their investment. But if we can demonstrate that HAMLET works, I
think no major company would be able to refuse.''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Ever wonder how Post-it notes work?
</P>
<P>
   How about Scotch tape?
</P>
<P>
   There are two kinds of secrets about adhesives. One is the
chemical and industrial recipes for how to make the best ones.
</P>
<P>
   The other kind of secret is the deeper kind: the physical
mechanism that explains how adhesives work. No one really knows
that secret, surprisingly enough _ maybe not even 3M, the
manufacturer Post-it notes.
</P>
<P>
   We live in an age when everything from space-shuttle engines to
disposable diapers are strewn with adhesives. Yet we still don't
know exactly what makes them stick.
</P>
<P>
   Or do we? A couple of French physicists have recently come up
with a new idea. Their hypothesis applies especially to adhesives
like those used in Scotch tape and Post-its, the kind that stick
immediately when you push them against a surface. (Glues, which
have to dry to become sticky and, in the process, undergo a
physical or chemical transformation, are a whole different kettle
of polymers.)
</P>
<P>
   The key to pressure-sensitive adhesives, say Ludwik Leibler and
Cyprien Gay, are bubbles: microscopic bits of partial vacuum that
act like suction cups to keep the sticky stuff stuck.
</P>
<P>
   The lab Leibler directs and Gay works at resides at Elf Atochem,
another of the world's leading adhesive manufacturers. But the two
physicists are also affiliated with the French National Center for
Scientific Research, which explains why they have the leisure time
to look into the basic physics of adhesion.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that nothing is known about the subject, Gay says.
Researchers discovered more than a century ago that there was an
electrostatic attraction, called the van der Waals force, between
any two surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   Positively charged particles on one surface tend to be attracted
to negatively charged particles on the other, with the result that
the two surfaces as a whole attract each other. Press your finger
flat against the surface of a table and then pull it away: the
slight stick is the van der Waals force.
</P>
<P>
   But it is very slight. The van der Waals force is roughly a ten-
thousandth of the force exerted by an everyday tape. Adhesives have
something else going for them: They are all made of polymers.
</P>
<P>
   Polymers are chain molecules, like spaghetti, except that
relative to their own diameter they are even longer than spaghetti
strands. And, like spaghetti, they get tangled up.
</P>
<P>
   Polymer adhesives are viscoelastic. It takes a lot of work to
pull them apart _ about 100 times, physicists have calculated, what
it would take to unstick something held by van der Waals attraction
alone.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that even the aforementioned hundredfold increase
cannot completely explain the stickiness of real adhesives. This
has been brought home to researchers in the past decade, as they
have now learned how to measure stickiness precisely.
</P>
<P>
   In such experiments, a surface is coated with an adhesive, a
metal probe is pressed against the adhesive, and the probe is then
pulled away. It's like using your finger to see if a surface is
sticky, only the laboratory apparatus is sensitive enough to
measure precisely what force the probe has to exert to pull away at
a steady speed.
</P>
<P>
   To break free of a good adhesive, it turns out, a probe or a
finger typically has to give a brief hard yank at first, followed
by a long, steady, but less forceful pull _ that is, the force
curve shows a sharp peak and then a long plateau.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists have had no good explanation for this familiar
pattern, Gay says. Nor could they explain why the overall adhesion
energy should be so much larger than that accounted for by van der
Waals and viscoelastic forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``With viscoelasticity you get about a hundred times more than
from the van der Waals force alone,'' Gay says. ``But if you
actually measure the energy of an adhesive, you get something
10,000 times more. That's the great problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, physicists are missing a factor of 100; they
understand only about 1 percent of the reason why Scotch tape
sticks as well as it does.
</P>
<P>
   Leibler and Gay think bubbles may account for the other 99
percent. The bubbles arise because the surface of Scotch or any
other tape is not as smooth as it looks to the naked eye.
</P>
<P>
   Under a microscope the adhesive becomes a rugged landscape of
mountains a few ten-thousandths of an inch high, separated by val
leys a few thousandths of an inch across.
</P>
<P>
   When a metal probe presses down onto that landscape, the
mountains and the passes between them come into contact with the
metal _ but not the floors of the valleys. Lens-shaped bubbles of
air get trapped there, like patches of ground fog.
</P>
<P>
   When the probe is pulled away again, those bubbles swell in
volume. At first the passes are still blocked, and no air can
parent than the physics. flow into them from the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   Because the same amount of air is now filling a bigger volume,
the pressure inside the bubbles falls much lower than it is outside
_ just like in a suction cup.
</P>
<P>
   Picture thousands of tiny suction cups gripping a surface as you
try to rip off a recalcitrant strip of duct or packing tape: This
is the peak of the adhesive's force curve. As you keep pulling,
though, the bubbles widen and start to merge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now all the valleys are connected to one another and to the
outside,'' Gay says, ``and the air comes rushing in.''
</P>
<P>
   The nontechnical term for this moment is ``pop.''
</P>
<P>
   As the air-filled valleys continue to grow, the shrinking
mountains of adhesive become islands that soon stretch into long
fibers.
</P>
<P>
   The fibers still cling to the surface, in Leibler and Gay's
model, thanks to a second population of bubbles _ the ones that
form in the tiny valleys on the surface of the metal probe, which
isn't smooth either. Only when those bubbles pop, too, or the
viscoelastic fibers snap in the middle, does the adhesive
relinquish its grip.
</P>
<P>
   Though he has reason to be proud of his bubble theory, Ludwik
Leibler can step back from his work and see the big picture:
``People have made very good adhesives without understanding
bubbles.''
</P>
<P>
   Enough said.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Ever wonder how Post-it notes work?
</P>
<P>
   How about Scotch tape?
</P>
<P>
   There are two kinds of secrets about adhesives. One is the
chemical and industrial recipes for how to make the best ones.
</P>
<P>
   The other kind of secret is the deeper kind: the physical
mechanism that explains how adhesives work. No one really knows
that secret, surprisingly enough _ maybe not even 3M, the
manufacturer Post-it notes.
</P>
<P>
   We live in an age when everything from space-shuttle engines to
disposable diapers are strewn with adhesives. Yet we still don't
know exactly what makes them stick.
</P>
<P>
   Or do we? A couple of French physicists have recently come up
with a new idea. Their hypothesis applies especially to adhesives
like those used in Scotch tape and Post-its, the kind that stick
immediately when you push them against a surface. (Glues, which
have to dry to become sticky and, in the process, undergo a
physical or chemical transformation, are a whole different kettle
of polymers.)
</P>
<P>
   The key to pressure-sensitive adhesives, say Ludwik Leibler and
Cyprien Gay, are bubbles: microscopic bits of partial vacuum that
act like suction cups to keep the sticky stuff stuck.
</P>
<P>
   The lab Leibler directs and Gay works at resides at Elf Atochem,
another of the world's leading adhesive manufacturers. But the two
physicists are also affiliated with the French National Center for
Scientific Research, which explains why they have the leisure time
to look into the basic physics of adhesion.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that nothing is known about the subject, Gay says.
Researchers discovered more than a century ago that there was an
electrostatic attraction, called the van der Waals force, between
any two surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   Positively charged particles on one surface tend to be attracted
to negatively charged particles on the other, with the result that
the two surfaces as a whole attract each other. Press your finger
flat against the surface of a table and then pull it away: the
slight stick is the van der Waals force.
</P>
<P>
   But it is very slight. The van der Waals force is roughly a ten-
thousandth of the force exerted by an everyday tape. Adhesives have
something else going for them: They are all made of polymers.
</P>
<P>
   Polymers are chain molecules, like spaghetti, except that
relative to their own diameter they are even longer than spaghetti
strands. And, like spaghetti, they get tangled up.
</P>
<P>
   Polymer adhesives are viscoelastic. It takes a lot of work to
pull them apart _ about 100 times, physicists have calculated, what
it would take to unstick something held by van der Waals attraction
alone.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that even the aforementioned hundredfold increase
cannot completely explain the stickiness of real adhesives. This
has been brought home to researchers in the past decade, as they
have now learned how to measure stickiness precisely.
</P>
<P>
   In such experiments, a surface is coated with an adhesive, a
metal probe is pressed against the adhesive, and the probe is then
pulled away. It's like using your finger to see if a surface is
sticky, only the laboratory apparatus is sensitive enough to
measure precisely what force the probe has to exert to pull away at
a steady speed.
</P>
<P>
   To break free of a good adhesive, it turns out, a probe or a
finger typically has to give a brief hard yank at first, followed
by a long, steady, but less forceful pull _ that is, the force
curve shows a sharp peak and then a long plateau.
</P>

energy should be so much larger than that accounted for by van der
Waals and viscoelastic forces.
</P>

from the van der Waals force alone,'' Gay says. ``But if you
actually measure the energy of an adhesive, you get something
10,000 times more. That's the great problem.''

<P>
   When Catharina Svanborg and her research associates began mixing
mothers' milk and cancer cells together seven years ago, she wasn't
looking for a cure for cancer; she was after a way to fight germs.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the physician and immunologist at Lund University
in Sweden has discovered that a previously taken-for-granted
component of ordinary human breast milk compels cancer cells _
every type of cancer cell tested _ to die.
</P>
<P>
   Now Svanborg must prove her discovery, demonstrating to wary
scientists that her surprising find is for real. So far, it hasn't
been easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extremely important observation, interesting and
provocative,'' says breast-cancer researcher David Salomon of the
National Cancer Institute. ``But it's novel, and novelty always
runs the risk of challenging the current dogma. A lot of times you
run up against a brick wall of people who have tunnel vision.''
</P>
<P>
   It all began seven years ago, when her student Anders Hakansson
rushed into Svanborg's office with perplexing news. He had been
experimenting with human cancer cells, microbes and mothers' milk.
(Cancer cells make popular experimental models because they come in
standardized lab strains. In many important respects they behave
just like other human cells in lab dishes.)
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to pinpoint how the milk blocks bacteria from
infecting other cells. But the cancer cells in this experiment were
acting up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their volume was decreasing,'' Hakansson recalls. ``Their
nuclei were shrinking. Something was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   When Svanborg sat down at the microscope, she diagnosed the
problem immediately. ``The cancer cells are committing suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Cells commit suicide all the time, a phenomenon called
apoptosis, in which the body rids itself of old or unnecessary
cells. They simply fall apart and are recycled.
</P>
<P>
   For cancer cells, however, suicide is rare indeed. Their
defining characteristic is uncontrolled reproduction. Yet somehow,
the breast milk induced these cancer cells to take their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   Could the discovery be developed into a cancer cure?
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, much of Svanborg's work has prepared her for this
specific research. She and her group had studied the nature and
function of epithelial cells, the gut-lining cells that come into
contact with breast milk in nursing infants. And they had
experimented with mother's milk many times.
</P>
<P>
   They had shown that it does a terrific job of blocking infection
by pneumococcus bacteria, the cause of pneumonia, and that
breast-fed children suffer significantly fewer ear and upper
respiratory tract infections than babies who don't nurse.
</P>
<P>
   And her team had already done much of the homework that would be
needed. They had tracked down studies showing that breast milk also
protects against cancer. She wondered what accounted for that
discrepancy. Now she had at hand the results that might provide an
answer.
</P>
<P>
   It took more than two years before her team felt ready to share
its discovery with the rest of the world. In August 1995 they
announced that breast milk kills cancer cells and pinpointed the
killer, which turned out to be the protein alpha-lactalbumin
(alpha-lac for short). It helps produce lactose, the sugar found in
milk.
</P>
<P>
   Svanborg and her colleagues discovered that the protein was
performing the decidedly unprotein-like trick of changing its shape
_ and that it was persuading cancer cells to commit suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery also suggested a possible explanation of how
breast milk protects against cancer. Perhaps, Svanborg reasoned,
the errant cells that give rise to malignancies first show up in
infants. The key is breakneck reproduction, a characteristic of the
cells lining an infant's gut. Some of these cells may proliferate
out of control. That's called cancer. Or they may never fully
mature or stabilize, lurking in the system like time bombs, ever
ready to burst forth into tumors.
</P>
<P>
   Transformed alpha-lac ``targets not only cancer cells but all
kinds of immature, rapidly growing cells, and leaves mature, stable
cells alone,'' Svanborg says.
</P>
<P>
   Alpha-lac, then, may be conducting surveillance missions within
the nursing child, rooting out potentially malignant cells and
encouraging properly growing cells to mature. Because the lining of
the gut, a prime meeting point between the inside of the body and
the hazards of the outside world, is a headquarters of the immune
system, the vigilance may help the child's immune defenses develop.
</P>
<P>
   John Stevens, a vice president of grants at the American Cancer
Society, took notice. After reading the Svanborg team's research
paper, he made a journey to Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had not known of Lund University before, but we found
Catharina and her team to be very talented researchers, very
dedicated, and their work fascinating.''
</P>
<P>
   A $200,000 grant made Svanborg's the only non-American lab with
ACS support. So she got back to work with renewed enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The grant gave us recognition,'' Svanborg says. ``We came into
this from nowhere, and the cancer society gave us the stamp of
quality. Now the weight was on us to prove that this is real and
reproducible.''
</P>
<P>
   That effort has taken another four years. In January, Svanborg
released the team's most recent findings, bolstered by the work of
new collaborators, including researchers from the renowned
Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and Oxford University in England.
</P>
<P>
   The studies explain how transformed alpha-lac snuffs out cancer
and other risky cells, and characterizes the protein down to the
molecular level. And they announced that not only does it kill
cells, it eliminates pneumococcus bacteria, too. Svanborg, with her
longstanding interest in infectious disease, is as excited about
this finding as any. She envisions using alpha-lac as a tonic to
stop infections before they begin.
</P>
<P>
   The team has given the new protein a name: HAMLET for Human
Alpha-lactalbumin Made LEthal to Tumor cells.
</P>
<P>
   They now know just how the protein changes into a cancer
assassin. One key is the acid content of its surroundings. When
Svanborg initially prepared milk to pour over cells, she added acid
to the solution, hoping to separate out the microbe blockers.
Little did she know that this acid bath, like some magic potion,
would transform the well-mannered alpha-lac into HAMLET.
</P>
<P>
   But acid alone wasn't enough. Another mysterious factor was
needed. That, too, turned out to be a component of the milk itself.
(The lab has not yet made its identity public).
</P>
<P>
   Now that the team can generate genetically engineered HAMLET,
they can make changes in it, helping them learn the function of its
structural parts.
</P>
<P>
   The first step is to test HAMLET as a tumor killer in animals.
Svanborg and her team hope that because HAMLET is a naturally
occurring substance, it might not be toxic like so many other
cancer drugs. They've already tried it in mice, who tolerate very
high doses with no side effects.
</P>
<P>
   If animal tests go well, the next trials will be with humans.
That can take years. And then, Svanborg says, ``A major
pharmaceutical company must become convinced that this is worth
their investment. But if we can demonstrate that HAMLET works, I
think no major company would be able to refuse.''

cells, it eliminates pneumococcus bacteria, too. Svanborg, with her
longstanding interest in infectious disease, is as excited about
this finding as any. She envisions using alpha-lac as a tonic to
stop infections before they begin.
</P>
<P>
   The team has given the new protein a name: HAMLET for Human
Alpha-lactalbumin Made LEthal to Tumor cells.
</P>
<P>
   They now know just how the protein changes into a cancer
assassin. One key is the acid content of its surroundings. When
Svanborg initially prepared milk to pour over cells, she added acid
to the solution, hoping to separate out the microbe blockers.
Little did she know that this acid bath, like some magic potion,
would transform the well-mannered alpha-lac into HAMLET.
</P>
<P>
   But acid alone wasn't enough. Another mysterious factor was
needed. That, too, turned out to be a component of the milk itself.
(The lab has not yet made its identity public).
</P>
<P>
   Now that the team can generate genetically engineered HAMLET,
they can make changes in it, helping them learn the function of its
structural parts.
</P>
<P>
   The first step is to test HAMLET as a tumor killer in animals.
Svanborg and her team hope that because HAMLET is a naturally
occurring substance, it might not be toxic like so many other
cancer drugs. They've already tried it in mice, who tolerate very
high doses with no side effects.
</P>
<P>
   If animal tests go well, the next trials will be with humans.
That can take years. And then, Svanborg says, ``A major
pharmaceutical company must become convinced that this is worth
their investment. But if we can demonstrate that HAMLET works, I
think no major company would be able to refuse.''

<P>
   Ever wonder how Post-it notes work?
</P>
<P>
   How about Scotch tape?
</P>
<P>
   There are two kinds of secrets about adhesives. One is the
chemical and industrial recipes for how to make the best ones.
</P>
<P>
   The other kind of secret is the deeper kind: the physical
mechanism that explains how adhesives work. No one really knows
that secret, surprisingly enough _ maybe not even 3M, the
manufacturer Post-it notes.
</P>
<P>
   We live in an age when everything from space-shuttle engines to
disposable diapers are strewn with adhesives. Yet we still don't
know exactly what makes them stick.
</P>
<P>
   Or do we? A couple of French physicists have recently come up
with a new idea. Their hypothesis applies especially to adhesives
like those used in Scotch tape and Post-its, the kind that stick
immediately when you push them against a surface. (Glues, which
have to dry to become sticky and, in the process, undergo a
physical or chemical transformation, are a whole different kettle
of polymers.)
</P>
<P>
   The key to pressure-sensitive adhesives, say Ludwik Leibler and
Cyprien Gay, are bubbles: microscopic bits of partial vacuum that
act like suction cups to keep the sticky stuff stuck.
</P>
<P>
   The lab Leibler directs and Gay works at resides at Elf Atochem,
another of the world's leading adhesive manufacturers. But the two
physicists are also affiliated with the French National Center for
Scientific Research, which explains why they have the leisure time
to look into the basic physics of adhesion.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that nothing is known about the subject, Gay says.
Researchers discovered more than a century ago that there was an
electrostatic attraction, called the van der Waals force, between
any two surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   Positively charged particles on one surface tend to be attracted
to negatively charged particles on the other, with the result that
the two surfaces as a whole attract each other. Press your finger
flat against the surface of a table and then pull it away: the
slight stick is the van der Waals force.
</P>
<P>
   But it is very slight. The van der Waals force is roughly a ten-
thousandth of the force exerted by an everyday tape. Adhesives have
something else going for them: They are all made of polymers.
</P>
<P>
   Polymers are chain molecules, like spaghetti, except that
relative to their own diameter they are even longer than spaghetti
strands. And, like spaghetti, they get tangled up.
</P>
<P>
   Polymer adhesives are viscoelastic. It takes a lot of work to
pull them apart _ about 100 times, physicists have calculated, what
it would take to unstick something held by van der Waals attraction
alone.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that even the aforementioned hundredfold increase
cannot completely explain the stickiness of real adhesives. This
has been brought home to researchers in the past decade, as they
have now learned how to measure stickiness precisely.
</P>
<P>
   In such experiments, a surface is coated with an adhesive, a
metal probe is pressed against the adhesive, and the probe is then
pulled away. It's like using your finger to see if a surface is
sticky, only the laboratory apparatus is sensitive enough to
measure precisely what force the probe has to exert to pull away at
a steady speed.
</P>
<P>
   To break free of a good adhesive, it turns out, a probe or a
finger typically has to give a brief hard yank at first, followed
by a long, steady, but less forceful pull _ that is, the force
curve shows a sharp peak and then a long plateau.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists have had no good explanation for this familiar
pattern, Gay says. Nor could they explain why the overall adhesion
energy should be so much larger than that accounted for by van der
Waals and viscoelastic forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``With viscoelasticity you get about a hundred times more than
from the van der Waals force alone,'' Gay says. ``But if you
actually measure the energy of an adhesive, you get something
10,000 times more. That's the great problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, physicists are missing a factor of 100; they
understand only about 1 percent of the reason why Scotch tape
sticks as well as it does.
</P>
<P>
   Leibler and Gay think bubbles may account for the other 99
percent. The bubbles arise because the surface of Scotch or any
other tape is not as smooth as it looks to the naked eye.
</P>
<P>
   Under a microscope the adhesive becomes a rugged landscape of
mountains a few ten-thousandths of an inch high, separated by val
leys a few thousandths of an inch across.
</P>
<P>
   When a metal probe presses down onto that landscape, the
mountains and the passes between them come into contact with the
metal _ but not the floors of the valleys. Lens-shaped bubbles of
air get trapped there, like patches of ground fog.
</P>
<P>
   When the probe is pulled away again, those bubbles swell in
volume. At first the passes are still blocked, and no air can
parent than the physics. flow into them from the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   Because the same amount of air is now filling a bigger volume,
the pressure inside the bubbles falls much lower than it is outside
_ just like in a suction cup.
</P>
<P>
   Picture thousands of tiny suction cups gripping a surface as you
try to rip off a recalcitrant strip of duct or packing tape: This
is the peak of the adhesive's force curve. As you keep pulling,
though, the bubbles widen and start to merge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now all the valleys are connected to one another and to the
outside,'' Gay says, ``and the air comes rushing in.''
</P>
<P>
   The nontechnical term for this moment is ``pop.''
</P>
<P>
   As the air-filled valleys continue to grow, the shrinking
mountains of adhesive become islands that soon stretch into long
fibers.
</P>
<P>
   The fibers still cling to the surface, in Leibler and Gay's
model, thanks to a second population of bubbles _ the ones that
form in the tiny valleys on the surface of the metal probe, which
isn't smooth either. Only when those bubbles pop, too, or the
viscoelastic fibers snap in the middle, does the adhesive
relinquish its grip.
</P>
<P>
   Though he has reason to be proud of his bubble theory, Ludwik
Leibler can step back from his work and see the big picture:
``People have made very good adhesives without understanding
bubbles.''
</P>
<P>
   Enough said.

   The Kansas City Star plans to offer these stories to clients of
the New York Times News Service. All are from features. All will
move in the ``e'' category. All are for immediate release.
</P>
<P>
   TV-PRESIDENTS (undated) _ If you want to catch TV's most
captivating series this summer, don't look to HBO. Don't look to
MTV. Look to C-SPAN.
</P>
<P>
   The weekly ``American Presidents: Life Portraits,'' three-hour
treatments of each of the nation's 41 chief executives, may be
television's most ambitious documentary project ever.
</P>
<P>
   But aside from its obvious value to history buffs, what makes
``American Presidents'' so compelling are the unexpected, ongoing
and often contentious debates that take place between the program's
featured historians and its viewers who call in and offer very
different takes on the American presidents. Aaron Barnhart. 1,300
words. Story will move in the ``e'' category.
</P>
<P>
   THEATER-JAZZ (undated) _ On stage and screen, dramas that
address the jazz life mostly depict a pathetic character:
irresponsible, out of touch, doomed. An eccentric figure who
performs music disdained by the mainstream. Or worse, an outright
loser who regularly escapes from reality by means of a needle.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Side Man,'' a Broadway drama given the Tony Award for Best
Play in June, the title character is a journeyman musician who has
disappointed his wife and son by virtue of his dedication to music.
Another recent play, ``Oo-Bla-Dee,'' centers on a saxophonist whose
hunger for success stems from a troubled past. Calvin Wilson. 1,400
words. Story will move in the ``e'' category.
</P>
<P>
   COPLAND-BIOGRAPHY (undated) _ Cowboys and common men,
Appalachian settlers and Abraham Lincoln: Aaron Copland created the
very definition in music of what it means to be American. Which
brought him his share of pooh-poohers, who could sniff at a musical
Norman Rockwell enshrining rose-tinted myths of masculinity, family
and community.
</P>
<P>
   The truth, of course, was much more complex. On the eve of the
composer's centenary _ he was born Nov. 14, 1900 _ we now can see
him as a true giant of 20th-century artistic creation. Scott
Cantrell. 1,625 words. Story will move in the ``e'' category.

NEW PLAYS DEPICT JAZZ MUSICIANS IN MORE COMPLEX WAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CALVIN WILSON  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jazzman: Think junkie, drunkard, womanizer. Think narcissistic,
self-destructive, unhinged.
</P>
<P>
   On stage and screen, dramas that address the jazz life mostly
depict a pathetic character: irresponsible, out of touch, doomed.
An eccentric figure who performs music disdained by the mainstream.
Or worse, an outright loser who regularly escapes from reality by
means of a needle.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Side Man,'' a Broadway drama given the Tony Award for Best
Play in June, the title character is a journeyman musician who has
disappointed his wife and son by virtue of his dedication to music.
Another recent play, ``Oo-Bla-Dee,'' centers on a saxophonist whose
hunger for success stems from a troubled past.
</P>
<P>
   In both dramas, the protagonists are at once frustrated by and
freed from American ideals of success. Like the central figures of
such films as ``Bird,'' ``Round Midnight'' and ``Mo' Better
Blues,'' they place their art above all else.
</P>
<P>
   The jazz artist as nonconformist was the unifying theme of
``Bird'' (1988), director Clint Eastwood's film biography of bebop
icon Charlie Parker. But the film focused on drug addiction and
alcohol abuse, leaving Parker's artistic life inadequately
explored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually jazz guys are portrayed as out-of-control junkies,''
said Krin Gabbard, author of Jammin' at the Margins: Jazz and the
American Cinema. ``Or their devotion to the music is so abnormal
and so pathological that it makes them really sort of subhuman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bird'' was a far cry from jazz-bio movies of the 1950s, which
portrayed bandleaders such as Glenn Miller and Benny Goodman as
well-scrubbed boys next door. They were anything but social
outcasts, and in their enthusiasm for jazz they came off rather
like Boy Scouts collecting arrowheads.
</P>
<P>
   ``When swing was so popular, it was no big deal to suggest that
swing musicians were people you should look up to,'' Gabbard said.
``So if you're going to get a positive view of jazz, it's going to
be white swing.''
</P>
<P>
   Seldom has a bop artist been positively portrayed in film. A
notable exception was ``Sweet Smell of Success'' (1957), in which
Martin Milner _ a freckle-faced actor with a perpetually goofy
expression _ portrayed a musician in love with the sister of an
egomaniacal gossip columnist played by Burt Lancaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milner's the only really positive character in the whole
film,'' Gabbard said. ``He won't compromise, he won't sell out, he
sees through the hypocrisy of the culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's appropriate, of course, that he gets beat up. But the
film portrays American society as basically corrupt and shows the
jazz guy as the pure artist with ideals.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Side Man,'' playwright Warren Leight created a central
character for whom jazz is an obsession.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys I knew growing up all were at their best on a
bandstand or with a trumpet in their hands,'' Leight said by
e-mail. ``The rest of life was the stuff in-between. That sort of
discipline and passion is cause for celebration _ but something
about the obsession seems to create a distance from the rest of the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Side Man'' is a memory play that centers on a trumpeter named
Gene and is narrated by his son Clifford. While there have been
other plays about jazz artists _ ``Ma Rainey's Black Bottom'' and
``Lady Day at Emerson's Bar &AMP; Grill'' _ ``Side Man'' is a rarity
for Broadway in that it presents a full-bodied portrait of a jazz
artist in the context of family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nicest comments I get come from New York's side men,''
Leight said. ``They stop me everywhere and say, `Thanks for finally
telling our story.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gene idolizes the legends of the music _ especially the great
trumpeter Clifford Brown, for whom he named his son _ but doubts
his own talents. Still, he allows the music to dictate his destiny
as the play's action progresses from the 1950s to the '80s.
Ultimately, Gene's passion for jazz alienates him from his family.
</P>
<P>
   Gin Del Sol, the central character in Regina Taylor's
``Oo-Bla-Dee,'' is a saxophonist who has given up the opportunity
to be a wife and mother, opting instead to try her luck at playing
bebop in the 1940s. The drama about an all-female band was recently
presented at the Goodman Theatre in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Where Gene has to decide whether pursuing jazz is worth losing
his loved ones, Del Sol has found a surrogate family in the
musicians with whom she travels from gig to gig.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to center on the world of music that they lived in,''
Taylor said, ``and to write about the importance of their music.
Why did they choose this road rather than make some other choices
in their lives?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some films set in recent times have presented jazz
musicians as stubborn caretakers of an art form the public is too
unsophisticated to appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   In director Bertrand Tavernier's ``Round Midnight'' (1986),
real-life saxophonist Dexter Gordon played Dale Turner, an
alcoholic, world-weary bopper who is befriended by an avid French
fan. Turner was a conflation of saxophonist Lester Young and
pianist Bud Powell, both of whom struggled with personal problems.
</P>
<P>
   The mood of ``Round Midnight'' is reflective as Turner attempts
to clean up his act and reclaim his art. Gordon, who received an
Academy Award nomination for Best Actor, dominated a film in which
he wrote much of his own dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Spike Lee's ``Mo' Better Blues'' (1990) focused on trumpeter
Bleek Gilliam, played by Denzel Washington, who led a neobop combo
not unlike those associated with jazz traditionalist Wynton
Marsalis. Gilliam is disappointed that audiences seem to prefer
rhythm and blues, but he remains committed to acoustic jazz despite
opposition from his rebellious saxophonist, played by Wesley
Snipes.
</P>
<P>
   Invariably, the jazz world depicted in film and theater smacks
of nostalgia. The stories tend to be set in the past, allowing
audiences to comfortably view jazz life from a safe distance.
</P>
<P>
   In Robert Altman's ``Kansas City,'' jazz players created the
musical backdrop for a tale of crime, corruption and murder in the
1930s. Altman repeatedly cut back to a never-ending jam session at
18th and Vine, depicting a little island of spiritual purity in a
world gone mad.
</P>
<P>
   These golden-tinged nostalgic views obscure the fact that jazz
was once considered an iconoclastic music, associated not only with
the ongoing African-American struggle for social equality but also
with the Beat movement of the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   The anarchic bebop cries of Parker energized the Beats, who
challenged the suburban complacency that beset America in the wake
of World War II. In the 1960s, free-jazz musicians wailed away as
cities _ and draft cards _ burned. To these musicians, who took
their cues from the visionary innovations of John Coltrane and
Ornette Coleman, jazz unencumbered by chord changes mirrored the
dismantling of an unjust society.
</P>
<P>
   But to capture those realities would be a daunting challenge for
any dramatist. Drug abuse and crumbling interpersonal relationships
are relatively easy stories to tell.
</P>
<P>
   Approaching the millennium, jazz is at a crossroads. On the one
hand, it's a music that holds a certain cachet and can be heard in
television commercials for expensive automobiles and other symbols
of conspicuous consumption.
</P>
<P>
   On the other, the music represents a retrenchment from current
woes. A cable channel devoted to old movies employs jazz in
advertisements for its viewer guide. And the entire ``young lions''
movement of the 1980s was largely dedicated to reviving old songs
and performance styles, not expanding upon the tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jazz was most vital in the past,'' Taylor said. ``You don't
have as many pioneers in the music _ people going in new
directions, rather than being standard-bearers. I think there are
some steps that have been made since Coltrane, but no big leaps.''
</P>
<P>
   For Leight, ``Side Man'' is simply a way of saying thanks to all
the jazz artists who made such immortal music at such personal
costs. And who deserve a more respectful public image than has
usually been accorded them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theater has all but ignored jazz,'' he said. ``I had an almost
impossible time getting a production of `Side Man' because most
producers immediately were turned off when they learned the play
was set in a jazz context.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, that is what made the play special, too.''

   Pillow talk for a king's ransom
</P>
<P>
   You've heard of walking on air. But how about sleeping on money?
</P>
<P>
   For $2,300 you can lay rest your head on what's being touted as
the world's most expensive pillow: eiderdown filling, covered with
435-thread-count silk, woven in Germany. For that price, it
!ital!is!off!, of course, king-size.
</P>
<P>
   It's ``so light and soft _ so sinfully luxurious _ your friends
and neighbors will have `pillow envy,''' promises David Pipkorn,
pillow pundit and vice president of manufacturing for the Company
Store of La Crosse, Wis., catalog supplier of pillows, comforters,
featherbeds and other sleep products.
</P>
<P>
   The filling for the pricey pillows comes from eider (CQ) ducks,
who line their nests _ in Iceland and the northern islands and
coastal areas of Canada and the United States _ with their own down
to keep their ducklings warm. Once the babies have flown the coop
and mom's moved on, farmers collect the rare, soft down, which is
made into pillows.
</P>
<P>
   The major drawback to buying a $2,300 pillow, says Pipkorn, is
that your bed mate's going to want one, too. For those on tighter
budgets, the Company Store offers a queen-size eiderdown pillow for
$2,000, or a standard-size one for $1,800.

SHOWTIME, HBO TURN UP THE HEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The popular success of such shows as ``The
Sopranos'' and ``Sex and the City'' _ among many other original,
daring offerings _ has illustrated just how far cable has come in
the television universe. But it's easy to forget that what brought
new viewers to pay-cable channels such as HBO and Showtime was
high-quality, original movies.
</P>
<P>
   When the networks were content to crank out pablum and Hollywood
movie studios were offering feature films that took no chances (a
trend that continues), cable channels found high-profile directors
to tell stories they said could never be made on the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   After HBO and Showtime swept through the Television Critics
Association summer press tour last week, they left behind more
evidence of how they're willing to present risky or unorthodox
stories unlikely to be seen at your local multiplex.
</P>
<P>
   Highest on that list would be Showtime's ``Execution of
Justice,'' which will dredge up the Dan White, Harvey Milk and
George Moscone affair once again. Based on the Emily Mann play
about a deadly political feud at the San Francisco City Hall, the
movie will focus on White's mental meltdown and the incredible
impact of having the country's first openly gay elected official
assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   The film was directed by Leon Ichaso (``Sugar Hill,'' ``Free of
Eden''), who said he screened the film for a group of his gay
friends and they all ``love it,'' even though the film is told from
White's perspective. White, a former San Francisco supervisor, was
convicted in the shooting deaths of Moscone, then the city's mayor,
and Milk, a member of the Board of Supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   White spent only five years and one month in jail for the City
Hall killings, getting paroled in January 1984. He was found dead
in October 1985 _ from carbon monoxide poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Execution of Justice'' continues a long tradition of pay-cable
movies being made simply to tell a story, not rake in box-office
numbers. And Showtime, in particular, has been marketing itself
aggressively as a home to filmmakers who can't get their films
released elsewhere, particularly if they are controversial, such as
``Bastard Out of Carolina'' and ``Lolita.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Showtime launched its ``No Limits'' campaign and has
stuck to the concept with such gay-issue films as ``Twilight of the
Golds'' and the race-based ``Mandela and De Klerk.''
</P>
<P>
   The no-censorship approach and open-mindedness also landed
acclaimed movies ``Gods and Monsters'' and ``The Baby Dance.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Showtime will take on such odd topics as ``Noriega:
God's Favorite,'' with Bob Hoskins, the true-crime ``Happy Face
Murders'' and ``Strange Justice,'' a high-profile,
behind-the-scenes account of the Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill affair.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of another strong Showtime movie push couldn't come
at a better time. Rival HBO has gone through an executive shuffle
in its movie branch that has stalled projects and thinned its
original movie offerings. And Showtime recently debuted the
exceptionally good satirical series about the TV industry,
``Beggars and Choosers.''
</P>
<P>
   That was meant to be the kind of water-cooler show like ``The
Sopranos'' that would get people to subscribe _ and to narrow the
gap between the two competitors. The hard part about trying to
compete with HBO, however, is that it takes very few missteps,
having an uncanny ability to deliver original programming as daring
as Showtime's movies, and to produce the kind of telefilms that set
the standard.
</P>
<P>
   This season, even with a diminished dramatic movie cache, HBO
will present a film about Dorothy Dandridge starring Halle Berry;
``Witness Protection,'' based on a journalistic account of seeing
the federal witness protection program from the inside; and a
fictional account of the battle between William Randolph Hearst and
Orson Welles, called ``RKO 281.''
</P>
<P>
   The latter movie is indicative _ yet again _ of how far
pay-cable outlets have come in their ability to corral major
talent. The film's executive producer is Ridley Scott, who was
mesmerized by the PBS documentary, ``The Battle Over Citizen
Kane.''
</P>
<P>
   He brought Liev Schreiber to play Welles, James Cromwell
(``Babe'') to play Hearst _ the newspaper patriarch _ and big-name
talent John Malkovich, Melanie Griffith, Roy Scheider and Brenda
Blethyn.
</P>
<P>
   Like Showtime's film on the White-Milk-Moscone incident, HBO's
project came about because of the current passive and panicky state
of the movie industry. New HBO film head Colin Callendar said ``RKO
281'' _ based on the RKO Studios production title _ was a good fit
and ``therefore more than appropriate that when every studio in
Hollywood passed on a script about the making of perhaps the most
famous biographical movie, `Citizen Kane,' HBO should step up to
the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been clear for some time that, as these two rival networks
slug it out, the winner is the viewing audience. Showtime made the
aggressively edgy ``Rude Awakening'' to compete with a slew of
successful original programming from HBO _ much of it gobbling up
Emmys with such ferocity that the broadcast networks were
embarrassed. And Showtime's ``Linc's'' is the most fully realized
all-black-cast series on television in years.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that everything works. HBO and Showtime have
made their share of horrible movies, and Showtime hasn't always
fared well with its original series, but each has reached the level
_ or bettered it in many cases _ of what is being presented to
viewers on ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC.
</P>
<P>
   And the combined pay-cable efforts have had another effect:
forcing those same broadcast networks to do better or get passed.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are the Big Four ceding viewers to cable at an alarming
rate, they are losing out on Emmys and are having those
all-important, water-cooler conversations turn from the likes of
``Ally McBeal'' to ``The Sopranos.'' That has raised the bar to
some extent in what we've seen the past two seasons in the fall,
particularly with dramas.
</P>
<P>
   The broadcast networks can't afford to get lazy because there's
no let-up in the creative mad dash of HBO and Showtime.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest indicator of how far these two cable
networks have come is the relative lack of surprise when they
achieve greatness. Not long ago, a single beacon of light to come
out of either camp was treated as some odd miracle, temporarily
distracting people from the broadcast networks. Now, both are
almost expected to offer movies and series that are superior to the
networks _ an astonishing turn of expectation.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's less interesting now to compare their work with
that of the Big Four, and more revealing to see how the gap closes
between them.

AARON COPLAND EMERGES AS A MAN OF TALENT AND POINT IN NEW
BIOGRAPHY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANTRELL  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cowboys and common men, Appalachian settlers and Abraham
Lincoln: Aaron Copland created the very definition in music of what
it means to be American. Which brought him his share of
pooh-poohers, who could sniff at a musical Norman Rockwell
enshrining rose-tinted myths of masculinity, family and community.
</P>
<P>
   The truth, of course, was much more complex. On the eve of the
composer's centenary _ he was born Nov. 14, 1900 _ we now can see
him as a true giant of 20th-century artistic creation.
</P>
<P>
   If his music sometimes tapped into American myths, well, Bach
and Wagner did the same with the myths of their own culture,
Lutheran and Nordic. And by now surely it's beyond argument that
Copland was as fine and versatile a musical craftsman as any in the
century he bestrode like a hawk-beaked, buck-toothed colossus.
</P>
<P>
   Say what you will of the sepia sentimentality of ``Appalachian
Spring,'' originally music for a Martha Graham ballet: From the
first, quiet buildup of that deliciously piquant chord, there's not
a wasted note, not a note out of place.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the epitome, as Howard Pollack points out in his new
biography of the composer, of ``that combination of `vastness' and
`clarity' that art critic Robert Hughes finds so characteristic of
American painting in all its phases.''
</P>
<P>
   What's surprising is that we've had to wait nearly a decade
after Copland's death, in December 1990, for a book that puts our
avuncular musical prophet and priest in full perspective. But here
it is: Pollack's Aaron Copland: The Life and Work of an Uncommon
Man (Henry Holt, $37.50).
</P>
<P>
   We may as well put the caveats up front. Although, overall, the
690-page tome traces the continuum of Copland's 90 years, it keeps
getting waylaid by themes: ``Personal Affairs,'' ``An Engaged
Citizen,'' ``Identity Issues.'' One understands the motivation, but
it makes for a sometimes confusing read. It's tricky to return to
threads dropped along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Nonspecialist readers will skip over the sometimes protracted
discussions _ not really analyses _ of individual scores. Laced
through the narrative, these might have been better grouped after
the biography. And, although Pollack is a far clearer writer than
most academics _ he's a professor at the University of Houston _
only in his introductory chapter, ``A Copland Portrait,'' does his
prose occasionally sparkle.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not to deny Pollack's enormous achievement.
Especially impressive is his negotiation of sensitive issues
scarcely broached in Copland's autobiography co-authored with
Vivian Perlis and issued in two installments in the 1980s. (Useful
as these volumes are, they rely heavily on earlier writings and
reminiscences from the composer's later years, when his mind was
failing.)
</P>
<P>
   Our great populist
</P>
<P>
   There may be some readers surprised to learn that Copland _
whose most popular scores make a virtual religion of all-American
masculinity, home and hearth _ was homosexual. But, far from the
neurotic, self-loathing artiste of cliche, Copland early on found
his orientation no more an issue than the pale gray-blue color of
his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The product of a more reserved time, and in every respect the
most discreet and tactful of human beings, Copland neither
advertised his sexuality nor concealed it. He was neither
effeminate nor effortfully ``butch.'' If the public at large had no
clue, apart from the fact that Copland never married, his
orientation was no secret in the musical profession.
</P>
<P>
   Copland had, Pollack reveals, a lifelong attraction to younger
men, mainly in their 20s. And, for someone hardly handsome in any
conventional sense, he had a remarkable string of good-looking
inamoratos. His longest relationship, lasting from the early '30s
to the early '40s, was with the violinist Victor Kraft, but there
were subsequent affairs with the painter Alvin Ross, the pianist
(and later writer) Paul Moor, the dancer Erik Johns and others.
</P>
<P>
   These were often unsettled, even troubled, young men, drawn to
Copland's calm, centered, nonjudgmental demeanor, as well as to his
fame and intellect. And Copland saw these relationships, Johns
observed, as ``the classic Greek thing with an older man adoring
and mentoring a younger guy.'' The friendships remained even when
the physical relationships fizzled.
</P>
<P>
   If homosexuality gave Copland no abnormal grief, another
flirtation was to cause him great anxiety _ and prompt a summons
before Sen. Joseph McCarthy's dreaded Senate Permanent Subcommittee
on Investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Probably more embarrassed than willfully deceptive about his
connections with the fringes of American communism during the
1930s, Copland in later years was less than forthcoming about this
episode in his life. Nor is this chapter entirely clarified by
contradictory evidence from other sources.
</P>
<P>
   Copland was a lifelong liberal, favoring causes including
freedom of expression (a natural issue for an artist) and
international exchange. And in the 1930s, in common with a whole
raft of artistic and literary figures both in the United States and
abroad, he was drawn to a political philosophy that ostensibly
favored the working population over the economic aristocracy.
</P>
<P>
   As someone raised in modest circumstances, and all his life
frugal with money, Copland was appalled at the widening gap between
haves and have-nots, a gap that reached critical mass during the
Great Depression. As someone devoted to the life of the mind and
the imagination, he decried a culture consumed with getting and
spending. A political system that promised a leveling of the
economic playing field _ what could be more American? _ had a
natural appeal.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of his communist flirtation Copland supported the
party's presidential ticket, gave speeches supporting other
candidates and even set a ``workers, unite'' poem to music. He was
also at least marginally affiliated with the communist-sympathetic
Composers' Collective, whose active members included Elie
Siegmeister, Hanns Eisler and Charles Seeger.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, with what we now know of Stalin's murderous purges
and the daily dehumanization of the Soviet Union, the '30s
flirtation with communism seems, at best, astonishingly naive. But
even the United States government counted Stalin as an ally through
World War II; only later did the ``evil empire'' rise in world
consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, although consistently liberal in outlook, Copland never
actually belonged to any political party. In politics as in art, he
decried narrow sectarianism. Long before the concept had its
present name, Copland was an apostle of inclusiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, Copland's most all-American works _ among them
``Billy the Kid'' and ``Appalachian Spring'' _ sprang from the same
sentiments as his cozying up to communism. Having created an early
splash with music identified with European elitism, Copland in the
late '30s and early '40s became our great musical populist.
</P>
<P>
   That Kansas City-born Virgil Thomson's musical Americana _
including scores for the ballet ``Filling Station'' and the films
``The Plow That Broke the Plains'' and ``The River'' _ predated
Copland's doesn't detract from the latter's greater sophistication.
Nor does film composers' subsequent appropriation of Copland's
musical language compromise his creative accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   A generous spirit
</P>
<P>
   A big part of Pollack's contribution is to fill in the complex
web of Copland's connections. In a profession rife with backbiting,
Copland maintained a keen interest in and friendship with other
composers all over the world. As a concert organizer, performer and
advocate he did as much to advance other composers' music as his
own.
</P>
<P>
   Both as an official teacher _ notably at the Boston Symphony's
summer academy at Tanglewood, in western Massachusetts _ and as a
more casual mentor, he was ever kind to aspiring composers. But
Copland's intellectual curiosity also embraced literature, the
visual arts and even film, and he moved easily among their
creators.
</P>
<P>
   Copland was also the rare musician as articulate in word, both
spoken and written, as in musical deed. His unaffected clarity and
affability made him a uniquely persuasive spokesman for
contemporary, and especially American, music. His books, What to
Listen for in Music and Our New Music, remain worthy reading.
</P>
<P>
   To be a saint, as the younger composer Ned Rorem has observed,
one has to have been a sinner, and Copland had his petty faults:
his selective deafness (as all of us have) to certain composers and
works, his rare flashes of anger and impatience.
</P>
<P>
   Some would reckon his lack of an enduring personal relationship
a fault, evidence of a certain remoteness beneath the external
bonhomie. And, yes, he was capable of composing well below
masterpiece level.
</P>
<P>
   But the Copland portrayed by Pollack seems to have been
overwhelmingly a genuinely good man: open, enthusiastic, generous.
And it comes across in his music, in manifestations as different as
the stirring ``Lincoln Portrait'' and the knotty late
``Connotations.''
</P>
<P>
   Copland's great tragedy was that senile dementia gradually drew
a black curtain over his final years. As early as the middle 1970s
his memory was failing, and he was repeating himself in
conversation. By the end he was an uncomprehending shadow of the
man he had been, although even then friends were struck by a
certain enduring poise.
</P>
<P>
   Copland's compositional career essentially ended 20 years before
his life, but he professed himself unconcerned by the drying up of
inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   At age 80, he told Phillip Ramey, ``I'm amazed that I don't miss
composing more than I do. You'd think if you had spent 50 years at
it you'd have the feeling that something was missing, and I really
don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must have expressed myself sufficiently. I certainly don't
feel tortured or bitter, only lucky to have been given so long to
be creative.''
</P>
<P>
   We were lucky, too. As we are, finally, to have Howard Pollack's
generous survey of an uncommon man's creative and human
accomplishment.

<P>
   ``American Presidents'' airs weekly on C-SPAN at 8 a.m. Mondays
and repeats at 7 p.m. Fridays (central time).
</P>
<P>
   If you want to catch TV's most captivating series this summer,
don't look to HBO. Don't look to MTV. Look to C-SPAN.
</P>
<P>
   The weekly ``American Presidents: Life Portraits,'' three-hour
treatments of each of the nation's 41 chief executives, may be
television's most ambitious documentary project ever.
</P>
<P>
   But aside from its obvious value to history buffs, what makes
``American Presidents'' so compelling are the unexpected, ongoing
and often contentious debates that take place between the program's
featured historians and its viewers who call in and offer very
different takes on the American presidents.
</P>
<P>
   It only took five minutes of the first program last March for
the intellectual food to fly. As viewers watched the snow fall
outside the colonial home of George Washington in Mount Vernon,
Va., C-SPAN founder and CEO Brian Lamb took a phone call from a man
in Denver who introduced himself as ``a descendant of slaves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so easy for white people to get on TV and vouch about
the character of people they did not know personally who would
enslave a whole group of people,'' the caller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States of America condoned it, its institutions
supported it, and until the government apologizes for it, in my
mind I think Washington is no better than Adolf Hitler and he
should not be put on a pedestal.''
</P>
<P>
   Without missing a beat, Lamb tossed the question to his guest,
biographer Richard Norton Smith. Moments earlier the two men had
been chatting on live TV about Washington's wooden teeth, but now
Smith's tone turned cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you try to do is not so much pass judgment, but to turn
the clock back and try not to apply the standards of our own
time,'' Smith began.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not to justify the institution,'' he said as he folded
his arms across his chest, ``but to try to understand a man of good
will who was in many ways trapped in an institution not of his own
making.''
</P>
<P>
   This same scene has played itself out repeatedly on ``American
Presidents'': African-American callers pouring out their anguish
and bitterness at the country's great white fathers, and on-camera
experts offering responses ranging from apology and sympathy,
usually to no one's satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would agree with the previous caller that most of the guests
you have on have a rejoicing attitude toward the suffering of a
race of people,'' said a Cleveland woman during the Millard
Fillmore program.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're telling us (these presidents) were opposed to slavery,
but plainly they weren't,'' said a caller from Seattle on another
program.
</P>
<P>
   Other callers were clearly frustrated by the fixation on race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy this series very much, but as soon as slavery comes
in, the next 45 minutes are devoted to slavery,'' complained a
caller in New Jersey during the Franklin Pierce program.
</P>
<P>
   To which Barry Paris, the lead guest on the Pierce program,
replied, ``The reason it's coming up constantly is that it came up
constantly throughout this period and obsessed the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Paris is one of the few biographers in the series so far to
denounce his subject's views on slavery as ``racist'' and
``genocidal.'' Perhaps that is because, unlike other guests on
``American Presidents,'' Paris writes on many topics. Besides his
forthcoming book on Pierce, he has written definitive biographies
of Audrey Hepburn and Louise Brooks and a book about an American
who founded a free hospital in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I heard all of my life and once bought into as a
biographer was that you can't judge a 19th-century person by 1999
standards,'' said Paris in a phone interview from his home in
Pittsburgh. ``It's not true. You do judge people, not by 1999
standards, but by timeless, universal ethical standards. There were
people in 1852 who knew that slavery was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while six of the first eight U.S. presidents owned
slaves, the Adamses from abolition-minded Massachusetts did not.
And even nonslave-holding presidents like Millard Fillmore helped
perpetuate the institution by signing the Fugitive Slave Act in
1850.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their criticisms of the presidents and of C-SPAN, many
of the callers who identify themselves as African-Americans appear
to be as hooked on the series as anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Feelings, an award-winning children's book illustrator whose
works include To Be a Slave and The Middle Passage, has phoned into
``American Presidents'' twice. He's also been taping the programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were these people who kept calling in saying, `Why do we
have to keep focusing on slavery? I want to hear about the
president's personal life,' '' Feelings said from Columbia, S.C.
``And yet you cannot get away from slavery if you talk about the
presidents. That goes so far as Franklin Roosevelt, who refused to
sign an anti-lynching bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Feelings said most of the experts who have appeared on the
C-SPAN series lack empathy for black people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impossible for them to put themselves in the shoes of the
African, but it's very easy to put themselves in the shoes of the
president or any other white.''
</P>
<P>
   So what does C-SPAN's Lamb think about the direction ``American
Presidents'' has taken?
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' he said. ``I love it when somebody calls in with
something that upends everybody. I prefer that to bringing in my
own agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Insofar as one can plan for the unplanned, that was C-SPAN's
intent for ``American Presidents.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We in television are so used to a writer or producer putting a
point of view into a program, but we don't,'' Lamb said. ``The
whole purpose of doing this was to open up the process, take 30 or
40 calls every program and let the chips fall where they may.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamb admitted that most of the historians who appear on the
series ``aren't normally challenged in this way,'' from anonymous
inquisitors. The series producers are trying to book nonwhite
historians, but Lamb said it's not easy since ``most history is
written by white males.''
</P>
<P>
   Several African-American historians have appeared on ``American
Presidents.'' Professor Allan Ballard was interviewed for one
segment of the Ulysses S. Grant program. Annette Gordon-Reed
discussed her book on Thomas Jefferson's relationship with one of
his slaves, Sally Hemings.
</P>
<P>
   Lamb is encouraged by the number of African-American callers,
which seems to be trending up. During the Andrew Johnson program
two weeks ago, Lamb said that five of the first 16 callers
identified themselves as African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue, which is very much an issue in our society today,
has been the most talked-about thread in this series,'' Lamb said.
``And if a group of people in this country who are normally not
heard from are exercising their opportunity to be heard here,
that's great.''
</P>
<P>
   Paris agrees. Having reluctantly agreed to do ``American
Presidents'' (lack of pay and nervousness about live TV), Paris was
exhilarated by the experience. Afterward he was inundated with
phone calls and letters from viewers offering ``the most amazing
pieces of information'' for his biography of Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they didn't expect this hostility to come through,''
said Paris of his C-SPAN handlers. ``But you know what? That's
wonderful. And that's what makes it such a great series, because
here you see how alive an issue this is in many black Americans'
hearts.''

By CAROL BIDWELL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Action so vivid that you seem a part of it ...
sound so real it makes your teeth rattle ... music so primal you
can feel the floor vibrate beneath your feet ... and the fridge
just a few feet away.
</P>
<P>
   That's what home theater's all about.
</P>
<P>
   Once within the reach of only the few multimillionaires or movie
studio executives, advances in electronics now make it possible for
even ordinary folks _ with a moderately fat wallet _ to have a
taste of the total movie-theater experience in their own homes.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody with a few thousand bucks to spend can buy a big-screen
TV and a killer sound system at any of the big electronics stores.
Tinkerers can sink thousands of dollars more into additional
components for a bigger, more vivid picture and more realistic,
loosen-your-fillings sound. And just-do-it-big-and-send-me-the-bill
movie lovers can have a real live theater _ complete with
refreshment stand and carefully hidden screens and projectors _
built in their homes for $100,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   While many women appreciate the convenience and privacy of the
finished product,
</P>
<P>
   making a home theater happen is basically a guy thing, says Mike
Hymes, whose Van Nuys company has installed hundreds of home
theaters for clients that include Clint Eastwood and former
President Ronald Reagan at prices ranging from $20,000 to $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we bring the client in and it's all finished _ we've
tested it all before, so we know it works perfectly _ and we crank
it up, he just goes `Wow!' It's fantasyland. It's truly a man's
toy. He can just have so much fun with this.''
</P>
<P>
   The home theater market began to heat up about seven years ago
when the first big-screen TVs went on the market. Now Hymes'
40-year-old Micheal's Co. is selling surround sound, THX sound
systems, line doublers and quadruplers for sharper pictures, and
giant-screen front-projection movie systems, all housed in
top-of-the-line cabinetry.
</P>
<P>
   And, if the difference between men and boys is the price of
their toys, there's no doubt that today's gadget-minded guys are
all grown up.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Americans spent more than $6 billion on home theater
installations, according to the Custom Electronic Design
Installation Association in Indianapolis, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the economy holds, 1999 sales figures will reflect a 22
percent to 25 percent increase from 1998 figures,'' predicted
Billilynne Keller, CEDIA's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   And while electronics chain stores advertise components to
assemble-it-yourselfers, most home theaters are ``sold'' by word of
mouth, said Randy Wilson, president of Wilson Home Theater Systems
in Woodland Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes a status thing,'' Wilson said. ``It's like when one
house on the block had a pool, and everybody else had to have a
pool. Then people got tennis courts and home gyms. Now, it's
theaters.''
</P>
<P>
   When he and his wife, Lynn, moved into their Thousand Oaks home
in 1990, Allen, a top executive for a major movie studio's music
division (who, for security reasons, declines to reveal his last
name), wanted all the bells and whistles in his home theater _ some
that were then only available to real movie theaters and
moviemakers. He hired Wilson, who went to the same sources
professional theaters used for the latest in DVD technology _ which
Allen had actually helped develop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then, we really didn't have the consumer products
available, so we were using professional products,'' Wilson said.
``(Allen) was one of the first people outside a movie studio to
have DVD.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen dotes on his theater. It includes a 120-inch screen and a
THX sound system linked by a single master remote control to a CD
player, VCR and other components.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn has little appreciation for the technology (``I don't touch
the buttons''), but she likes the fact that the theater is an
almost unrecognizable part of their Mediterranean-style home. When
nobody's watching a movie, the ``theater'' is a welcoming family
room with an ordinary TV set, a comfortable couch and four
butter-colored leather swivel recliners.
</P>
<P>
   But when it's time for a showing of ``The Godfather'' or
``Twister,'' Allen presses a few buttons on the master remote, and
the screen slides out of a slot in the ceiling. The projector is
lowered from a hidden trap door in the ceiling over the coffee
table. Electronically controlled outside shutters cover the windows
to darken the room. And a blue velvet curtain glides across the
room's semicircular entrance. The lights dim.
</P>
<P>
   And it's showtime.
</P>
<P>
   To add to the going-to-the-movies ambience, a corner bar has
been painted to look like a refreshment stand, and Allen and Lynn
hired a muralist to depict the family waiting in line at a movie
box office on one wall; the picture masks the door to the tiny room
that houses both the theater system's electronic components and a
large collection of movies.
</P>
<P>
   The technology _ and the ambience _ cost about $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty expensive toy,'' said Allen. ``It's definitely
an indulgence. But we enjoy it. It used to be in the 1930s that
William Randolph Hearst was the only one who had a home theater.
Now, anybody can be a movie mogul.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, Steve Agajanian just wanted a nice TV and
good stereo equipment in his 1930s Pasadena home so he could listen
to his vast library of records and tapes and watch a few movies. So
he consulted Hymes. Seeing the technology available, his desire for
better sound turned into a need for big sound, a yearning to watch
movies on a giant screen in a setting that could double as a party
room.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, a cinder block-walled basement rumpus room has
become an entertainment haven housing his collection of American
Indian and cowboy art and artifacts, plus a 100-inch TV screen, a
ceiling-mounted projector, eight surround-sound speakers, a digital
satellite system, a DVD player and Web TV. All that's linked to a
state-of-the-art CD setup _ and an old-fashioned turntable for all
his old 33 rpm albums.
</P>
<P>
   From control panels throughout the house and on the patio by the
pool, he can dial up sound from the TV, the radio or any of his CDs
or albums.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have this vision when I started,'' said Agajanian, a
divorced, retired garbage company executive with two grown
children. ``One thing led to another, and I ended up with this
exquisite masterpiece of a room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I purposely decided to overdo it, because I wanted this to be
a `wow' room. People see it for the first time and go, `Wow!' When
I give people the tour of the house, I purposely leave this room
for last, because once they see it, they don't want to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   And he delights in demonstrating the subwoofer _ the big speaker
that sits under the screen, which transmits movies' lowest bass
notes: the low rumble of a rocket taking off, the roar of an
explosion, the beat of concert drums.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's turned up all the way, the whole room will rattle,''
he said with a grin. ``I love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Agajanian said he can't recall what his home theater cost, but
Hymes said a similar setup would cost about $190,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not working for the guy who wants to get the cheapest
stuff and slap it in,'' he said. ``People have a lot of money, and
they like the excitement of sitting in their own home and seeing
what other people can only see at the movies.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that a do-it-yourselfer with more time than
money and some training in electronics can't create his own home
theater.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Flynn of Granada Hills, a computer software designer for a
Simi Valley mortgage loan firm, got sucked into the home theater
maelstrom a bit at a time after hearing a surround-sound system at
a friend's home a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a bit of a film buff, I had to have one,'' recalled
Flynn, who has a library of more than 1,000 movies on laser discs.
``I love technology and gadgets.''
</P>
<P>
   An inexpensive sound system led to a bigger, better one with
bigger, better speakers. He acquired a laser disc player, then a
better one that would turn the discs over automatically. The
35-inch TV was exchanged for an 84-inch screen with a
ceiling-mounted projector and a THX sound system.
</P>
<P>
   He bought the pieces gradually, either at a discount or used: a
$10,000 projector marked down to $7,000; $7,000 worth of matched
speakers for $5,000 because they were demo models; amplifiers and a
laser disc player for about $1,000 each; a used $2,500 line doubler
for $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always looking for a deal, and I didn't spend it all at
one time,'' said Flynn, who's set up his own Web site to offer
advice to others who want to build a similar setup. ``I'd do my own
research and find out what the cool thing was and look until I got
the biggest bang for the buck. If I didn't have the money, I'd put
it on layaway.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was a millionaire, I'd probably do the same thing,
because it's just my nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Flynn and his movie-loving wife Babette eventually converted
their old garage into a space for all this technology.
</P>
<P>
   There's no gee-whiz movie-palace ambience in Flynn's home
theater. But in the stark white room, viewers can sink down in the
dark into one of two huge leather sofas and enjoy the same sharp,
giant picture and the same head-banging sound as any millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know the scene in `Jurassic Park' where the Tyrannosaurus
rex is walking toward the Jeep, and a cup of coffee on the
dashboard vibrates every time he takes a step? Well, I can put a
cup of water on the subwoofer, and the water in the cup will do the
same thing. It's so cool.'' &QL;

   Commentary

 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN RAMON, Calif. _ The jib is up, ladies. We've been caught.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have hypothesized for years that women crave
chocolate for physiological reasons. Our quest for Ding Dongs at 2
a.m. wasn't mere indulgence, gawd no. It was simply our body's
attempt to satisfy a natural female need for the potent chemistry
of chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't want to eat chocolate, but what could we do? It was
our body's fault. All that estrogen. Completely against our will,
dagnabit! Boo, chocolate. Pass the Mars Bar, please. We can't help
ourselves. And that Mrs. Fields brownie too, thank you.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, scientists believed this. Somehow women have
globally, collectively and instinctively convinced the medical
profession that the female body ... must ... have ... chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   Of course it's been a scam. And every woman from the Amazon to
Zimbabwe has been in on it. We've only endorsed this theory because
it's allowed us to indulge in a luxury that is sinfully delicious.
Sensual and stimulating. Fattening and bad for our skin, but hey,
our body craves the stuff (hah) and we can't help ourselves
(giggle), so get the hell out of the way or risk life and limb.
</P>
<P>
   And men have obliged because they believed in this physical
female requirement. Life has been sweet. But alas, the good times
are gone. We've been betrayed _ and by one of our own.
</P>
<P>
   In a study to be published later this year, researchers found
that Spanish women did not share the same intense devotion to
chocolate. In fact, Spanish women were no more enthusiastic about
chocolate than Spanish men.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, senoritas, twist that knife a little deeper in our backs,
why don't you? This study has led scientists to believe that a
craving for chocolate is cultural, not physiological. Now, when
women go ballistic because someone ate the last Sara Lee fudge
brownie, we can no longer blame our lack of control on
physiological needs.
</P>
<P>
   We'll actually be held accountable for our mood swings and
intense cravings.
</P>
<P>
   Curse those Spanish women.
</P>
<P>
   Our little female fraud, carefully nurtured over several
decades, was exposed by a few amigas who apparently were taking a
little siesta when instructions about ``Operation Chocolate'' were
whispered about.
</P>
<P>
   Women throughout the world are united in despair, yet we bear
our Spanish sisterhood no ill will. However, since the lovely
senoritas felt obliged to reveal our secrets at the cost of
betraying their own, we feel obliged to divulge a few well-known
truths: Julio Iglesias? Well, you know ...
</P>
<P>
   The Gipsy Kings? Them too. And all involved. Besides, they're
actually from southern France.
</P>
<P>
   Charo? From Brooklyn. Flamenco dancing? Spanish Riverdance.
</P>
<P>
   Sangria? Grape Kool-Aid. Imported from Hoboken.
</P>
<P>
   Of course we wouldn't divulge these truths if we were in our
right mind. But remember, women can no longer freely scarf a box of
Thin Mints without being considered weak. We can no longer declare
justifiable homicide when we kill for that last M &AMP; M.
</P>
<P>
   Life as we know it is over.
</P>
<P>
   So, senoritas, excuse your foreign sisters if we're just a tad
testy these days. Our tempers are hot, our patience short.
</P>
<P>
   We were caught with our fingers in the cookie jar and don't like
it one bit. Oh yeah, and one more thing: Antonio Banderas? You
guessed it.

LATE START TOWARD RETIREMENT SAVINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am a 51-year-old single woman and have no savings or
retirement plan. I work for a nursing home that has no retirement
benefit. What would be a good investment if I were to contribute
$100 every payday? Or would I have to put in more? I am raising a
grandchild and I do not own a home. So what would be the best
investment so that I would not have to live on Social Security
alone?
</P>
<P>
   S.E., Alvarado, Texas &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If you have no savings at all, I would begin your retirement
savings program with a general savings account. It's great to have
a retirement nest egg, but it's also a good idea to have some
substantial emergency savings _ at least a couple of thousand
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   So I would begin by putting that $100 from each paycheck into a
bank account, letting it accumulate until you have $3,000 amassed.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, I would invest $1,000 of it in a mutual fund, an
old favorite of mine: the Vanguard Index Value fund, which invests
in about two-thirds of the stocks in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
Index.
</P>
<P>
   The two-thirds held by this fund are those with the lowest
market price to book value measures _ typically older,
well-established, dividend-paying companies. For example, some of
the leading issues held by the fund are Exxon, AT&AMP;T, Royal Dutch
Petroleum, Bell South, Mobil, Ford Motor, and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   I suggest you make your first fund investment in an IRA account,
which will bring you several advantages and disadvantages.
</P>
<P>
   The key advantage relates to taxes. Not only can you deduct your
contributions, which are limited to $2,000 a year of earned income,
from your current federal taxable income, but any tax on earnings
generated by the IRA are deferred until you withdraw money in your
retirement years.
</P>
<P>
   The major disadvantage also relates to taxes: If you withdraw
money before age 59 1/2, you not only face the tax liability, but
also a 10 percent penalty on the amount of the withdrawal. (There
are a few exceptions to that rule, but they tend to apply to very
few people.)
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard normally requires a $3,000 minimum initial investment,
but for IRA accounts the minimum is reduced to $1,000. You then can
make as many additional contributions as you want, provided each
contribution is at least $100 and that the contributions don't
exceed the $2,000 limit per tax year or the amount of your earned
income.
</P>
<P>
   You should call Vanguard for a prospectus for the fund, and also
for materials explaining mutual fund risk and IRAs in general.
</P>
<P>
   You'll see that this fund has produced average annual total
returns of 23.20 percent for the past five years. That looks pretty
gaudy, but it's mostly reflecting the staggering success of the
stock market in general over that period. I think a reasonable
long-term expectation for the fund would be 10 percent average
annual returns.
</P>
<P>
   If your savings schedule will exceed the $2,000 limit for IRAs,
I suggest you stash whatever excess you generate in the bank until,
in addition to your $2,000 emergency savings, you have saved an
additional $3,000 representing the minimum to open a taxable
account.
</P>
<P>
   How much are you liable to accumulate? You don't specify how
frequently you are paid. If you were to save $100 a week for the
next 14 years, and if your investment did bring you 10 percent
average annual returns, you would amass $151,988 over 14 years.
</P>

<P>
   Q. My wife and I are both 73 and retired. We are living on my
pension and Social Security benefits, which combine to give us
$32,572 a year. Our home is paid for and the only debt we have
outstanding is an auto lease, which amounts to $616 a month for the
next three years. We have only one investment: $450,000 in Franklin
California Insured Tax-Free Income fund. The dividends currently
come to $22,800 a year. Do you think it is wise to have our total
investment in this fund? We are comfortable with the income. What
would you change?
</P>
<P>
   H.D., Santa Ana, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The Franklin California Insured Tax-Free Income fund is a
solid investment, and based on its long-term record I don't think
you have a lot to worry about in terms of safety.
</P>
<P>
   But I do wonder whether you might do better if you swapped some
of those tax-free municipals for taxable bonds.
</P>
<P>
   I know: There are some people for whom tax-free bonds nearly
represent a religion. My father was one of them, and he regularly
turned a deaf ear to the idea that he would be ahead of the game if
he swapped some of his munis for higher-yielding taxable bonds.
</P>
<P>
   For many people the additional yield from taxable investments
exceeds the additional tax liability that comes with them. But
Dad's mindset was that the taxman was already set to take enough,
and if his portfolio was adjusted to minimize the tax bill, that
was just dandy _ even if it cost him a few bucks.
</P>
<P>
   I would rather take the other road, even though it involves some
pretty careful analysis of your tax situation. In fact, if you
can't calculate what the tax effect of swapping some of the muni
fund position for a taxable holding, it would probably be worth
your while to pay a tax expert to do the work for you.
</P>
<P>
   Consider one likely swap. Vanguard GNMA fund shares many of the
attributes of your Franklin fund.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the insurance on the municipal bonds is matched
by the federal guarantee of both interest and principal payments on
the securities held by Vanguard GNMA.
</P>
<P>
   For another, both funds win five-star ratings from Morningstar
Mutual Funds. But according to Morningstar, the current yield on
Franklin California Insured Tax-Free Income fund is 5.72 percent,
and its five-year average annual return has been 6.91 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For Vanguard GNMA, the current yield is 6.7 percent, and the
10-year average annual return has been 8.13 percent. My bet is that
moving some of your muni holdings to the Ginnie Mae fund would put
you ahead after taxes.
</P>
<P>
   And while I'm not terrible worried about having all of your
savings in a single fund, it is of course also true that dividing
your investment between two funds is generally safer than sticking
with one.
</P>
<P>
   And if you don't agree, I understand: The Old Man would never
buy that argument either.

HOW DO WE GET COMPUTER TO EVERYONE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HOYE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - It's easy to lose perspective. &QL; 
That fact was underscored for me recently when the U.S. Commerce
Department released its third technology access survey, ``Falling
through the Net.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey shows how many of us have _ and don't have _ home
computers and Internet access. In case you missed it, you can read
the entire 125-page work at www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/ &QL; 
digitaldivide.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some highlights:
</P>
<P>
   - About 40 percent of American households have computers.
</P>
<P>
   - About 25 percent of those households with computers have
Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   - About 47 percent of Whites own computers, but minority
ownership is much lower. For example, just 25 percent of Hispanics
own computers.
</P>
<P>
   So, no matter how many people (including me) write or talk about
how computers are everywhere these days, the fact remains that the
vast majority of people still do not own computers _ at least not
at home.
</P>
<P>
   Even more telling was the fact that just 25 percent of those who
have computers at home also have access to the Internet, to the Web
and to all the information and resources the online world offers.
</P>
<P>
   That's amazing. Here we are, looking at a growing e-commerce
market that some predict will hit $1 trillion within the next three
years. Can you imagine what would be possible if everybody were
online?
</P>
<P>
   I thought about all this recently, as I drove my family through
the sand dunes and bleak desert that borders Interstate 8 from Yuma
and El Centro, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   We had just spent a week in San Diego, a vacation we'd
researched and planned using the Web. Travel sites, for example,
helped us find a nice hotel with reasonable rates. I think we even
checked the weather forecast before leaving home.
</P>
<P>
   We've come to consider checking the Web as just another thing to
do in preparation for a trip. It's as natural as packing a
suitcase. After reading about the Commerce Department study,
though, it's clear that what many of us take for granted is still
very much out of reach for most Americans. And that's not good.
</P>
<P>
   Experts constantly tout the need for children to learn computer
technology in order to succeed. An increasing number of people are
finding new jobs by posting resumes and conducting job hunts
online. The ability to communicate on an equal basis with anyone
via electronic messages is empowering.
</P>
<P>
   So how do we fix the fact that 60 percent of Americans don't
have computers at home, and even more lack online access? How do we
get a computer in every kitchen? How do we get everybody online? Do
we need a device not yet invented to replace our complicated
computers? Should we even try to fix the problem?
</P>
<P>
   I didn't come up with any easy answers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the value of computers, they remain expensive and
complicated. And even if you gave everybody in America a free
machine, how would you maintain them? How would you train users?
Would you provide upgrades every two years?
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, I find it hard to believe that we'll ever reach the
point where home computers are as ubiquitous as home telephones,
the latter of which can be found in about 94 percent of American
households.
</P>
<P>
   Although computers are an invaluable resource, allowing the
in-home use of educational software and individual research, I
think the access to the Internet and its sea of information is more
important.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, my solution would involve the invention of a small
device, perhaps 12-inches square and an inch or two deep, that
could be connected to the telephone line and would allow basic Web
access in any language via a touch-screen.
</P>
<P>
   The device should be available for free or no more than, say,
$30. It should work in concert with your phone, allowing
simultaneous Web surfing and voice calls. Finally, the Web access
should be free, assuming you're already paying for basic phone
service.
</P>
<P>
   Am I dreaming? Let me know what you think. Send me your thoughts
on this, and I'll publish the best ideas in a few weeks. I can be
reached via e-mail at dhoye(at)home.net or by regular mail at David
Hoye, c/o Arizona Central, 200 E. Van Buren St., Phoenix, AZ
85004. &QL; 
`Free' computer update &QL; 
Last week, I wrote about a new $400 rebate deal between America
Online (www.aol.com) and upstart computer maker eMachines
(www.e4me.com).
</P>
<P>
   If you buy a $399 computer from eMachines and sign up for three
years of online service with CompuServe 2000, which is owned by
AOL, you get a $400 rebate, essentially wiping out the cost of the
computer.
</P>
<P>
   This week, everybody's getting in on the same game.
</P>
<P>
   OfficeMax, for example, is promoting the same $400 rebate to
those who buy computers and sign up with CompuServe 2000. But
OfficeMax allows buyers to purchase any of several brands of
computers, not just eMachines.
</P>
<P>
   I also received e-mail from Len Gutman, public relations manager
at Insight in Tempe. He pointed out that Insight was about to
one-up everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starting Monday,'' he wrote, ``you can get an eMachine etower
333cs at Insight for $474 (and) get a $75 rebate. Then, if you sign
up with CompuServe for three years, eMachines will give you a $400
rebate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Total that up,'' Gutman concluded, ``and you actually make a
buck!''
</P>
<P>
   And here's another twist on the ``free PC'' theme: Micron
(www.micron.com) is offering a free Celeron-based PC to anyone who
signs up for a three-year Micron service package, which includes a
warranty, training and Internet access. Cost of the package:
$1,087.
</P>
<P>
   Want more? There are other ``free PC'' deals out there. Some
might make sense for you while others might actually be a bad idea.
Make sure you read and understand all the fine print before
deciding one way or the other.
</P>
<P>
   If you ask me, it looks as though we're headed for the day when
computers are handed out for virtually nothing just so you'll have
the tools you need to go online and spend money.
</P>
<P>
   Ahh, what crazy times we live in. &QL; 
A dose of humor for you &QL; 
The e-mail always brings something to laugh about, and this week
was no different.
</P>
<P>
   A reader named Milton S. sent along a humorous tale about a
French language class that was discussing how nouns in French are
designated either masculine or feminine.
</P>
<P>
   One student raised his hand and asked, ``What gender is a
computer?''
</P>
<P>
   What follows is a condensed version of the answer provided in
Milton's e-mail:
</P>
<P>
   The teacher divided the class into two groups _ one all male,
one all female _ and asked them to decide whether a computer should
be masculine or feminine.
</P>
<P>
   The group of women concluded that computers should be masculine
because:
</P>
<P>
   1. They have a lot of data but are still clueless.
</P>
<P>
   2. They are supposed to help you solve your problems, but half
the time they ARE the problem.
</P>
<P>
   3. As soon as you commit to one, you realize that if you had
waited a little longer you could have had a better model.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the group of men decided that computers should be
feminine because:
</P>
<P>
   1. No one but their creator understands their internal logic.
</P>
<P>
   2. Even your smallest mistakes are stored in long-term memory
for later retrieval.
</P>
<P>
   3. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself
spending half your paycheck on accessories for it.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks for the laughs, Milton! &QL;

LANGUAGE DIVIDES ULSTER NATIONALISTS, UNIONISTS 
</HEADLINE>
 ANALYSIS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST _ In the futile bid to return local government to
Northern Ireland, it could be that Prime Minister Tony Blair of
Britain made some unrealistic demands around some unreasonable
deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   After all, trying to get Irish republicans to pledge to turn in
weapons around Easter is not the most opportune time, given that
today's IRA men consider themselves the successors of the rebels
who staged the Easter Rising in 1916.
</P>
<P>
   It was hardly better timing in trying to get Protestant
unionists to compromise on their ``no guns, no government'' stance
this month in the heat of the marching season, when unionists
commemorate the 17th-century military victories over Catholic
forces that established a Protestant hegemony in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   But it could be that no matter when Blair and his Irish
counterpart, Bertie Ahern, tried to empower the local assembly that
is at the heart of the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, it was doomed
to the ignominy of Thursday's farce in the parliament building at
Stormont.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, the various parties had been allowed to
interpret the Good Friday Agreement in the terms most favorable to
each of them. Once the agreement was implemented, the variances in
interpretation, caused as much by cultural differences as political
ideology, were bound to surface.
</P>
<P>
   There is a simple fact here that is seldom acknowledged. Irish
Catholic nationalists and Ulster Protestant unionists use words and
language differently, a difference attributable to their religious
cultural identity, not their ethnic or political identity.
</P>
<P>
   The Northern Ireland Assembly, held up as the democratic
institution that would lead one of the world's most divided
societies out of 30 years of violent conflict, collapsed in a
windstorm of acrimony and malice. While there is no obvious
evidence that the cease-fires by republican and loyalist
paramilitary groups are about to break, the current political
vacuum will have to be filled soon or, as history here has shown,
gunmen will fill it.
</P>
<P>
   But just how to do that is anyone's guess. Blair and Ahern said
they gave it their best shot, providing a roadmap they called ``The
Way Forward,'' in which the 10 Cabinet posts to lead the local
government would be filled first, and then the Irish Republican
Army would be expected to begin turning in weapons within weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Ulster Unionists, representing the middle-class Protestants
who form the biggest voting bloc in Northern Ireland, rejected the
plan, and attempts to form a power-sharing government in their
absence collapsed in a sea of heckling and recrimination Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The two prime ministers devoted an inordinate amount of their
time over the last month trying to fashion a compromise to transfer
power from London to the Belfast assembly, believing that the
parties here would begin behaving like democrats once they had the
responsibility that comes with such authority.
</P>
<P>
   But it never got to that point, largely because neither Irish
republicans nor Protestant unionists trust each other enough to
take the first step to resolve their long dispute over what should
happen first, IRA disarmament or a local power-sharing government.
</P>
<P>
   Cultural differences were the stumbling block. Padraig O'Malley,
the senior fellow at the McCormack Institute for Public Affairs at
the University of Massachusetts, among others, has written
extensively about this difference _ of how Protestants in Northern
Ireland pride themselves on speaking plainly and directly, and how
Catholics use words liberally and elastically.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talk on different levels,'' O'Malley said in a telephone
interview. ``This is one of the cultural aspects that hasn't been
dealt with.''
</P>
<P>
   Dermot Nesbitt, one of the most moderate members of the Ulster
Unionist Party leadership, was asked recently if he seriously
believed that Sinn Fein was giving up its most sacred tenets as
part of a trick to gain concessions, such as prisoner releases,
before the IRA goes back to war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course not,'' Nesbitt replied, ``but I can't be sure, not
with what they have told me. They don't say what they really
mean.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Rev. William Fleming, a leading Ulster Protestant cleric
put it, ``The Catholic church divides sins into venial and mortal,
whereas the Protestant community doesn't see that as a legitimate
division in regard to sins. Venial sins just mean a sort of
untruthfulness. Deceptiveness for what is thought to be a good
purpose is not a very serious sin, whereas the Protestant ethos has
been that a man's word has been his bond and that if he says
something he means it and will stand by it and be willing to go to
any lengths to be a man of his word.''
</P>
<P>
   As O'Malley put it in a lecture in Belfast two years ago,
``Although both communities share a common first language, they
both need what philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre calls a second first
language, a common idiom that will allow them to articulate shared
values and overlapping aspirations.''
</P>
<P>
   That common idiom has not been in evidence in Belfast. A few
weeks ago, when Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams pledged that his party
could get the IRA to turn in weapons, Trimble attacked Adams's
language as vague and his word as meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, Sinn Fein officials grumble that Trimble and the
unionists don't understand that they have to leave some pledges
vague so that there will not be a mutiny in the ranks of
grass-roots IRA members.
</P>
<P>
   When Trimble says that unionists have no problem with sharing
power with Catholic nationalists, Adams says Trimble is lying,
because, as Adams sees it, if they had no problem, they would have
done it by now and not held up the weapons issue as an excuse for
refusing to share power. To Adams, actions speak much louder than
words in Protestants' acknowledging Catholics as their equals.
</P>
<P>
   O'Malley suggests the different ways Catholics and Protestants
view language meant it was inevitable that the Good Friday
Agreement would eventually lead to a stalemate. The agreement was
ingenious in that it was written with a vagueness that allowed
every side to put its own spin on it. But it promises all things to
all people. While that made it salable to various constituencies,
the devil in the detail inevitably would surface during its
implementation.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, in the current impasse, it is unionists who are
finding words and meaning where there are none, and it is the
nationalists who are acting like literalists. Adams quite rightly
points to the Good Friday Agreement and says there is nothing
linking the formation of the power-sharing government to IRA
disarming. But Trimble argues that it is in the very spirit of the
agreement that no one can maintain a private army in a democracy.
</P>
<P>
   So polarized is this society, however, that neither side can see
that unionists are acting like nationalists, and vice versa. Or, if
they can see this, no one can decide whether this is a sign of
progress, or mere coincidence. Certainly, no one's talking about
it.

`ONE CHINA' MOVE REFLECTS CHANGED PARTY, PUBLIC IN TAIWAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI _ For 50 years, the leaders of mainland China and Taiwan
have agreed on one thing, and one thing only: that the island of
Taiwan is an inalienable part of China.
</P>
<P>
   But as years have passed, the governments of Beijing and Taipei
have followed radically divergent paths, making the notion of one
nation little more than a fiction. Communist China has mushroomed
in global power and influence and slowly liberalized its economy,
but retained a repressive, one-party rule. Tiny Taiwan emerged as a
capitalist success story and a spirited democracy, leaving behind
its authoritarian past. Along the way, the ``one China'' line that
both sides have toed came to mask an ever-expanding divide across
the 100-mile wide Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
   Half a century after a civil war between Communists and
Nationalists drove the losers to the island of Taiwan, many
Taiwanese feel profoundly alienated from the place mainland China
has become. Even those who long for reunification do not want to
live under communism, and Taiwanese who visit the mainland often
return disillusioned with China and disparaging of mainlanders as
poor, unsophisticated, and uncouth.
</P>
<P>
   For over 40 years, the United States has been Taiwan's number
one trade partner and the major influence on Taiwanese society, and
in countless ways, Taipei feels closer to Los Angeles than it does
to Beijing. The 10th anniversary of the massacre of democracy
protesters in Beijing's Tiananmen Square riled only a few dozen
sympathizers enough to march in Taipei. When supporters of a fringe
socialist party drive around town blasting the national anthem of
the People's Republic of China, the common reaction of Taipei
residents is not allegiance, but confusion: What is that song?
</P>
<P>
   So in many ways, Taipei's move last week to scrap the ``one
China'' idea and call for ``special state-to-state relations'' with
Beijing was a long time coming. It reflects not only a shift in
public opinion, but a dramatic evolution in the mentality of the
ruling Kuomintang party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody had to say it sooner or later. I'm not a fan of
President Lee Teng-hui or of the DPP,'' the pro-independence,
opposition Democratic Progressive Party, said Huang Jui-ming, a
lawyer. ``But he's only saying what the reality has been for 50
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, a native-born Taiwanese, has led Taiwan for nearly 12
years, and in that time the first-generation Nationalist leaders
from China have died and been marginalized, and the
pro-independence opposition has flourished.
</P>
<P>
   The 1970s saw Taiwan lose its UN membership and other diplomatic
recognitions to China, an experience that spurred a rise in
``native'' consciousness and a flowering of indigenous art and
literature. In the 1980s, the end of martial law accompanied a rise
in native-born politicians. The 1990s brought democracy and the
abolition of the provincial government, a vestige of the premise
that Taiwan is a province of China. So it was perhaps inevitable
that the ruling party's new generation would urge Lee to change his
China policy to fit the times, as they did in a confidential report
submitted to the president last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's ridden the tide of public opinion, and now he's trying to
lead the tide further. Society is ready for this,'' said Hsin-Huang
Michael Hsiao, a sociologist at Academica Sinica, Taiwan's national
academy, and a member of the National Reunification Council, an
elite advisory board to the President.
</P>
<P>
   His public may have been ready, but Lee's abandonment of the
``one China'' principle enraged Beijing, upset Washington, and
spooked Taipei's stock market with the possibility of military
conflict. China's military newspaper called Lee ``a criminal of the
nation who will leave a stink for a thousand years,'' and Beijing
Sunday repeated a vow to use force to stop Taiwan independence.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwanese people are famously pragmatic, and quarterly
government surveys consistently show the majority favor the status
quo in cross-straits relations. The last thing people here want is
war, or even hostilities that would rock their economy, one of the
few to escape the ravages of the two-year-old Asian crisis.
Taiwan's government Saturday used $11 billion in state funds to
shore up the stock market, and the Defense Ministry denied rumors
Sunday that China stepped up drills and sent fighter jets into the
Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous polls in recent days show more people approve of Lee's
``two state'' policy than oppose it. The most dramatic support was
reported in a survey released by Central News Agency Sunday that
found 73 percent behind the new policy.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction seems to divide largely along ethnic lines, between
those who came from the mainland or whose parents did, 15 percent
of the population, and those who have lived here for generations
and call themselves ``Taiwanese.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He said `one nation, two states,' but I don't think it should
even be `one nation,' '' declared Go Diang-ling, 46, an
eighth-generation Taiwanese who works at an ethnographic institute
that promotes native culture. ``I was in China two months ago, and
I won't accept life under that government. Now they say they have
the neutron bomb, but I'm not scared. I think we should stand up
for dignity and if necessary, die for this land.''
</P>
<P>
   That view differs markedly from people with strong emotional
ties to the mainland, such as Yi Ya-chieh, 55, a worker for the
maritime union. ``The policy of state-to-state relations gives up
the idea that Chinese people are one and the same nation. It's like
giving up the chance to be Chinese.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a striking generational split. Most younger
people, who have no memory of civil war or of China, seem to
support the notion of Taiwan and China as separate. Many older
voters, nostalgic for a united China and frightened of invasion or
economic collapse, are angry that Lee would risk stablity and
prosperity by rocking the boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terrible and it's dangerous. President Lee had no right
to say it. This island was originally part of China,'' raged an old
man who, like many elderly people interviewed, refused to give his
name because of his memory of military rule and his fear of
Taiwan's secret police.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Kao Hui-jung, a high school student, said she would
support the independence opposition party if she could vote. ``If
Taiwan doesn't declare independence and becomes part of China,
we'll have to pay for their economic problems,'' she reasoned.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Friday, Foreign Minister Jason Hu insisted the
government's goal of reunification once China has ``freedom,
democracy, and prosperity'' has not changed. The new policy, he
asserted, is intended to promote that goal by getting Beijing to
negotiate on more realistic and equal terms.

   ``We have to answer to 22 million people. You really think they
want to be just another province of the PRC'' he asked. ``What
can'' China ``offer us? What are'' they ``going to give me that I
don't already have today? I only hope the PRC will try to
understand us, our sentiment, our mentality, our frustration.''
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Chiang, publisher of the Taipei Times and an
independence advocate, said times have so changed that ``even civil
war veterans, old soldiers who dream to go back realize their home
is here. . . . China's military exercises against Taiwan dissipated
any feelings of loyalty. No government would use force against its
own people.''
</P>
<P>
   The gap today with China is so wide that the fringe socialist
labor party that blasts the PRC's national anthem from the windows
of its beaten-up sedan won only 1,020 votes nationwide in the last
election, Chiang said. ``Even though Lee Teng-hui talks about
eventual reunification when China becomes a democracy, I say, when
China becomes a democracy, why bother joining them? Xinjiang,
Tibet, Mongolia _ all will run away.''

SEN. SMITH HAS A POINT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; -- In the end, after not very much hesitation,
Republican Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire lumbered down the
aisle and voted loyally for the GOP version of minicontrols on
health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   There had been doubt about his vote in some Republican circles
earlier in the day, but I can't imagine why anyone would have
expected him to ditch the party on a big one like health care.
After all, as he himself likes to say, ``I'm the most reliable
Republican vote in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   You could look it up. In a compilation done annually by
Congressional Quarterly, Smith edges Idaho's Larry Craig as the
Republican most likely to do what most Republicans do on any given
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Smith brought this up in the context of his decision to resign
from the GOP and try to run for president on a new party or
third-party ticket. To borrow former Democrat Ronald Reagan's old
line, his party had left him, not the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   And he's right. The party that at least officially went
right-to-life 20 years ago with Reagan, is downplaying that
commitment today when it is not looking for ways to fudge it or
weaken it. The party whose platform has consistently sought the
closing down of serious chunks of the federal government or the
evisceration of others has no intention in practice anymore of
doing either. The party that also has pledged not to permit the
ceding of any American sovereignty to an international organization
routinely does exactly that. And its previously adamant position
against federal controls on gun ownership erodes a little more each
week.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans, myself included, would probably applaud these
shifts. And many conservatives are averting their gaze in the rush
to climb aboard the cash-heavy bandwagon of President-in-waiting
Bush. Meanwhile, many Republican politicians are condemning Smith
for being a renegade and vowing that his career is mortally
self-wounded, and many in both parties are openly mocking his
quixotic quest, complete with its self-comparisons to the Smith
that Jimmy Stewart portrayed as going to Washington 60 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Much of it is crude, even cruel, and quite possibly politically
way off base.
</P>
<P>
   As Smith and other movement conservatives like to say, with good
reason, the Republicans have done just fine when they stuck firmly
to conservative principles (the Reagan victories of 1980 and '84
and the congressional earthquake a decade later). And they have not
done so well when they have tried to soften those principles (the
presidential defeats of 1976, '92, and '96.
</P>
<P>
   To understand why Smith has a serious point (evidenced by the
nodding heads of more prominent conservatives even as they said
they would stick with their party for now), it helps to understand
where this guy comes from.
</P>
<P>
   He comes from the grass roots, where people with strong beliefs,
including the belief that beliefs matter, are most likely to be
found in politics today. Smith was brought up in New Jersey, but he
was formed in the insular world of town life in New Hampshire after
his Navy service, teaching school, coaching sports, and selling a
little real estate.
</P>
<P>
   His formative political experience was doing grunt work for
Barry Goldwater in 1964, but he came to life backing Ronald Reagan.
The second time around for Reagan in 1980, Smith was so energized
that he tried to jump from school board service to Congress from
the state's first district.
</P>
<P>
   That, he says, is when he got his first taste of what George W.
Bush's truly conservative opponents are calling the Republican
establishment. A heavy from Washington came up to see him, trying
to persuade him to quit the race and clear the field for a more
moderate candidate. He refused, lost the primary, won nomination
two years later, and made it here in the Reagan landslide of '84.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't changed; but his party clearly has.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's decision to resign his membership will cost him. He
probably loses any hope of moving up to chair the Senate's
Environment and Public Works Committee after Rhode Island's John
Chaffee retires; he loses party support if he decides to seek
reelection three years hence after a near-defeat in '96.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not how he sees it. This is an activist who has
decided that his party no longer means much of what it says, that
its establishment has become downright hostile to people like him.
</P>
<P>
   And that's why the real question following Smith's decision is
not how many other party figures follow him into disillusionment.
It's how many grass-roots activists decide there is no more cause
worthy of their anonymous toil.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Smith could be the tip of a real iceberg of turmoil on the
right. As usual, he spoke for a lot more conservatives than was
evident last week from the snickering his principled decision
elicited.

REACHING THE VIOLENT FEW: EDUCATORS NEED TO KNOW HOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beatrix Hamburg edited ``Violence in American Schools: New
Perspectives,'' which was published last year. She recently stepped
down as president of the William T. Grant Foundation for research
on children and youth. At the end of a school year most memorable
for the 12 students killed and 23 injured in a shooting spree at
Columbine High School in Colorado, she talked to Globe Assistant
Metro Editor Sarah Snyder about the causes and prevention of school
violence. Here are edited excerpts of their conversation:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Given the difference in the gun culture between Massachusetts
and states like Colorado or Georgia, where the year's worst school
shootings occurred, does a typical parent in a relatively peaceful
Boston suburb really need to worry about the possibility of armed
violence in their child's high school?
</P>
<P>
   A. I think it's important to understand that the social climate
has changed since Littleton and that all over the country, in at
least 300 schools since Littleton, credible plots to do some
shootings have been detected and aborted. They are all over: rural,
affluent, working-class schools. What it points out is that there
is no recognizable safe haven. It's evident that a copycat effect
is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is the copycat effect likely to evaporate over the summer?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think so. It seems as though the impact of Littleton
has been different. . . . In the current climate, if I were a
school principal in the Boston area I would at least want to do a
focus group (with students) and include among the questions ``How
easy do you think it is to obtain guns?'' . . . ``Do you feel your
school is safe?'' ``What do you suggest the school could do?'' Take
a reading. As a source of information, the students themselves are
the best.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. We have hundreds of violence prevention programs in New
England high schools, using techniques like peer mediation. But is
it naive to think such programs can affect a student as disturbed
as an Dylan Klebold? Do these programs really prevent youth
violence?
</P>
<P>
   A. Almost all schools in the nation have been mandated to have
such programs, and as a result a small industry of programs has
arisen. And one of the problems schools have is how to know if what
you're doing will work. It's very important that schools have
progams that at least have been evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, while I was president of the foundation, I
commissioned a group who had done a wonderful job evaluating
substance abuse programs to do a comparable job evaluating violence
reduction programs. (Their report) is called ``Safe Schools, Safe
Students: A Guide to Violence Prevention Strategies.'' The office
of juvenile justice programs in the Department of Justice also
commissioned a review of evaluated programs, easily obtained.
</P>
<P>
   The main thing I like in ``Safe Schools, Safe Students'' is, it
is clearly written and . . . one program isn't going to be perfect
for all schools, so it gives the core elements to include, and
offers principals a way to choose what seems right for their
school.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Were a significant number of the violence prevention programs
currently in schools judged to be ineffective?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. That has been a problem. Effective programs are often on
a weekly basis over an entire school year, rather than an assembly
or two. Effective programs are interactive _ they are not lectures
or film clips. They present dilemmas, and have the students
actively discuss them and interact. The very best programs want to
change the climate of the school.
</P>
<P>
   At Littleton, there were some hostile and demeaning interactions
in the school among the students at times, and a perception (that
the school) was not fair or just. Adolescents ae very sensitive to
things being unfair, and the jocks were allowed to park their cars
in forbidden spaces; if they got in trouble with the law, the
school got them off. . . . If you're not going to have smoldering
anger and resentment in a school, the climate of the entire school
needs to be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Boys were the offenders in all eight of the US high school
shootings in the past two years in which students were killed or
injured. Given that boys and girls are exposed to the same popular
culture, what accounts for boys being so much more violent?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, as it turns out, there has been a very marked rise in
overt confrontation, in physical violence by girls. So that's a
fact.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a longstanding cultural divide about what girls do
and what boys do, and there is a culture where well-meaning parents
have encouraged the idea (among boys) that part of the way you're
judged is whether you're tough. Some parents have told 8- and
9-year-old boys who come home crying after they've been beaten up
at school, ``You go back and fight your own battles.'' What we need
in this country, which is more violent than most, is a re-norming
of violence. The norm is that violence is acceptable and that for
boys it's part of your identity and manhood. I think it has to be
taught it's more a sign of manhood if you use your head and not
your hands, that you can control your anger, and that gives you an
advantage over someone who can't control his.
</P>
<P>
   Realistically, TV is not going to change. And those (video)
games _ Mortal Kombat _ are so profitable, they're not going to
change. It has to be families and schools taking the kids back.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. There were teenage boys in the '70s and '80s presumably as
ostracized or as emotionally disturbed as Eric Harris and Dylan
Klebold _ but they didn't shoot up high schools. What accounts for
the outbreak in the 1990s?
</P>
<P>
   A. The baselines of violence began rising in the '60s, and no
one paid attention because these school massacres didn't begin till
the the '90s. People were hearing about violence in the ghettos and
able to feel, look, in my commmunity it won't happen. Well, it is
happening, and it's bound to happen. Kids are more the same than
not.
</P>
<P>
   In the '50s, the only kids with guns were the ones hunting with
their parents, and the norm of how to use those guns was different.
It was not in a repertoire of response to shoot up your school.
After the Vietnam War there was a seachange in recognizing that
violent tactics work. In street demonstrations. In drug use.
Violence worked in the movies. Even President Reagan, I'm sure
without meaning to, was modeling violence to kids as acceptable and
useful with the ``make my day'' kind of comments. Then the gun
industry has just stepped up the availablity in the '80s. The guns
were a late entry in all of this, really.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How effective do you think posting the Ten Commandments in
classrooms would be in helping prevent violence, as the House of
Representatives has proposed allowing states to do?
</P>
<P>
   A. I think that's fine. I don't think it will make any more
difference than posting one guard at the door. In many cases, the
Ten Commandents will speak to the converted, the kids who already
believe that. It doesn't change the climate of the school to post
the Ten Commandments. But it does if teachers treat every student
with great respect and justice, and insist all the kids do the
same.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is the single most concrete thing parents can do to
raise nonviolent children?
</P>
<P>
   A. They should recognize they're smaller players in the lives of
their kids than they ever have been, with the impact of peers, TV,
and the Internet. But it's very important to be warm, to be
attentive, to listen, to teach them respect, and to deal with them
in a mode _ when kids get angry and yell _ that exaemplifies
conflict resolution at home. And avoid the trap with adolescents
of, ``Of course they'e not going to like their parents, and they
need to be independent.'' Avoid allowing them to become tyrants in
the home. Hang in there. And recognize you can't do it all.

ONLY THE BEST AT CAMP CAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I read about a summer camp in Vermont where people bring their
dogs for, as a camp brochure puts it,``a tailwagging good time.''
It's like a kids' summer camp, except the parents get to stay on
and join their surrogate children in activities such as sheep
herding, swimming, grooming, and animal communication.
</P>
<P>
   I tried to imagine a similar summer camp for cats and their
human companions. A luxury spa seems more up a cat's alley, one of
those places with private guest houses, massages, and room service
on call round the clock. A place just like home.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, Killer could use the summer camp experience. He needs
to learn to share. I visualized us rusticating in a lakeside cabin,
enjoying some of our favorite activities. Napping. Reading for me,
sitting on whatever I'm trying to read for Killer. A full cat camp
program began to take shape. Mouseplay. Extreme bird-watching.
Water-dish splashing. And while Killer was getting in his daily 18
hours of sleep, I could join my fellow human campers learning
advanced litter-box maintenance techniques and studying ways to
enrich our cats' environments.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental enrichment is a concept every caring cat person
must keep uppermost in mind. It can mean the difference between a
healthy, playful cat and a furry blob. I learned this by reading a
new book, ``Felinestein: Pampering the Genius in Your Cat.'' The
authors, Suzanne Delzio and veterinarian Cindy Ribarich, believe
that if a cat is to achieve his full intellectual potential he must
live in a stimulating environment, with lots of things to play
with, opportunities to explore and to make choices, and occasional
random or surprise events.
</P>
<P>
   They suggest, among other things, installing a catwalk of planks
around the inside perimeter of your house, about 2 feet from the
ceiling. ``With this walk in place,'' they write, ``the cat can . .
. look down and observe events, gaining a new perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is so important. Perspective is everything. Ask any cat.
</P>
<P>
   Delzio and Ribarich have lots of other ideas for enriching a
cat's environment. A comfy window perch. An aquarium. Kitty videos
featuring birds and small mammals. A $5,000 climbing structure.
</P>
<P>
   I bought Killer a $2,000 combination climbing structure/clawing
post a few months ago. It's called a living room couch. Sometimes
he lets me sit on it wth him.
</P>
<P>
   I think I must be part of a new trend I read about: people
furnishing and decorating their homes with their animals in mind.
But there's really nothing new about it. Anyone who lives with a
cat knows there are two key questions you must ask yourself before
you buy furniture:
</P>
<P>
   1)) Will the cat like it?
</P>
<P>
   2) How long will it take him to destroy it?
</P>
<P>
   The first question hinges on the second, because the cat won't
like it unless he can destroy it immediately.
</P>
<P>
   It took weeks to find the right couch for Killer. I was pawing
through fabric swatches one day, feeling desperate, when a
saleswoman asked if she could help. ``I feel foolish asking this,''
I said, ``but I have a cat and . . .''
</P>
<P>
   I didn't need to finish the sentence. The cat question was one
she fielded almost daily. She recommended a print, or a fabric with
a lot of texture, something with almost a pre-clawed look. Not that
I needed a pre-clawed look, because it was only a matter of days
before the new couch began to look as ratty as the old one. I am
trying to think of it as feline environmental enrichment. It looks
more like a big waste of money.

ONE GIANT LEAP . . . TO WHERE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a bit like the old joke about the dog that chases cars:
Once he catches one, what does he do then?
</P>
<P>
   After an audaciously heroic pledge by President Kennedy to send
a man to the moon and return him safely to Earth by the end of the
1960s, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration achieved
the goal in spectacular fashion _ just 30 years ago tomorrow (July
20).
</P>
<P>
   But then what?
</P>
<P>
   NASA had its plans, to be sure: An orbiting space station,
serviced by a fleet of shuttles, used as a staging area for the
next great project _ establishing a human presence on Mars by 1984.
</P>
<P>
   But President Nixon put the kibosh on the continuation of the
Kennedy-initiated program. The only part of the plan implemented,
albeit over budget and far behind schedule, was the fleet of
shuttles _ without a place to go or a clearly defined goal. The
ruddy soil of Mars is as far from being trampled by human feet
today as it was in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Not that NASA has been standing still. The last three decades
have seen a series of triumphs in the robotic exploration of the
solar system, transforming what was virtually a blank canvas at the
time of Apollo 11 into a series of real worlds, mapped,
photographed and probed in extraordinary _ and often dazzlingly
beautiful _ detail. And orbiting observatories, most notably the
Hubble Space Telescope, have opened the universe with a clarity
astronomers of the past could only dream of.
</P>
<P>
   But many scientists complain that the space program's
budget-gobbling emphasis on operating the space shuttle and
developing the new International Space Station _ NASA's primary
focus for more than a decade now _ has sapped resources that could
have been better spent on a much grander program of unpiloted
exploration. And some engineers and space entrepreneurs complain
that NASA's policies and pronouncements have thwarted, rather than
aided, the development of low-cost rockets that could truly open
the space frontier to widespread commercial development, even
tourism.
</P>
<P>
   The space program still earns great public admiration, but the
agency responsible for it seems perpetually under fire. And both
the people working within NASA and the critics sniping at it seem
to share a profound nostalgia for Apollo's glory days.
</P>
<P>
   Then, ``we were able to take risks because we were in a race
with the Russians,'' said Peter Diamandis, chairman of the X-Prize
foundation, which aims to spur private companies to develop
low-cost rockets by offering a $10 million prize to the first
company to send three people into space, and then do it again
within two weeks in the same rocket.
</P>
<P>
   What is lacking today, Diamandis said, ``is a pervasive single
vision, with the political will and ability to make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But most analysts agree that the cold war space-race mentality
that fueled the urgency of the moon program will never happen
again.
</P>
<P>
   NASA ``started out with a very specific task: Catch up with the
Russians,'' said Laurence Young, Apollo professor of astronautics
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Its success ``gave us
a sense that no problem was too difficult to work on.''
</P>
<P>
   But since Apollo, things have not progressed the way many people
had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty years after the Wright brothers, anybody who flew in
the air was generally a paying customer,'' said Tim Kyger, a
spokesman for Universal Space Lines, a company that hopes to
operate a commercial fleet of spaceliners and someday take paying
tourists into space. (Former Apollo astronaut Pete Conrad, who died
10 days ago, was the founder and president of the company.) ``It's
30 years after Apollo,'' Kyger said, ``and you still can't buy a
ticket to orbit.''
</P>
<P>
   But several startup companies aim to remedy that if they can
raise the necessary capital. Their common vision, manifested in a
variety of designs, is to produce a totally reusable rocket,
bringing greater economy to a business in which rockets are always
thrown away, in whole or in part, after every launch.
</P>
<P>
   NASA, recognizing it is dependent on rockets that were designed
at least a quarter-century ago, is also eager to see a new
generation of launch vehicles take off. And Congress is in the
midst of heated debate over a bill designed to foster development
of such alternative rockets through direct financial support.
</P>
<P>
   ``At NASA, we have made the commitment to help improve access to
space _ it is our numer one new development priority,'' said NASA
chief Daniel Goldin in a recent meeting with leaders of
space-oriented businesses. ``Our goal is to reduce the payload cost
to low-Earth orbit by an order of magnitude within ten years to
$1,000 per pound, and to $100 per pound within 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Many space advocates heartily endorse those goals, but blanch at
the timetable. Several companies working on the development of
reusable rockets think they can achieve a tenfold cost reduction in
just a few years _ if investors will put up the needed money, which
could total several hundred million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never been about technology,'' said Diamandis, referring
to the difficulties facing the startup companies. ``The roadblocks
so far have been financial and regulatory.''
</P>
<P>
   One company, Kistler Aerospace, has raised more than $450
million; another, Rotary Rocket, has acquired over $30 million; and
a third, Pioneer Rocketplane, is close to signing a lucrative deal
with the state of Utah. But all need much more money to proceed.
Kistler hopes to fly its first rocket by year's end, and Rotary
expects to launch next year.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the companies and their advocates are troubled by the
proposed new space legislation and by some recent comments from
NASA's Goldin about the extraordinary cost and time-consuming
nature of developing single-stage rockets, which they say could
frighten away potential investors. Meanwhile, the legislation as
presently drafted would do more to help giant aerospace companies
such as Lockheed Martin, increasing the improbability that startup
ventures can compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until recently,'' said Kyger, NASA had been ``at best,
slightly supportive, or at the least, benignly neglectful. But now,
they've been making negative statements that have chilled the
market.. . . (They have been) stomping on people, deliberately or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldin, in a series of written answers to questions posed by the
Globe, countered that ``I am a strong advocate of lower cost space
transportation. . . NASA must pursue the goal of reducing the
launch costs aggressively, while doing everything it can to assist
the emerging rocket companies with their mission of cheap access to
space.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, Goldin said NASA is considering providing help
in the form of loan guarantees, advance contracts for launch
services, or direct support for research. And far from being
pessimistic about these companies' prospects, Goldin added that ``I
am confident that their work will boost competition and provide new
alternatives for access to space.''
</P>
<P>
   Within NASA itself, there is debate about how best to address
future launch needs. Some advocate keeping the shuttle as NASA's
primary vehicle for another two or three decades. Others see hope
in the proposed reusable VentureStar rocket, whose smaller-scale
test version, called the X-33, is being developed by Lockheed
Martin under a NASA contract, but which would cost at least $6
billion more to develop into a usable version.
</P>
<P>
   A third option _ developing a small piloted craft that could be
launched atop any of a variety of either expendable or reusable
rockets _ may be the most benign course, the advocates say, because
it would not compete directly with the proposed reusable rockets
for such tasks as launching the expected constellations of new
low-orbit communications satellites. These are being designed for
global cellular phones and wireless high-speed Internet links, and
may require dozens of launches per year _ a potentially very
lucrative market.
</P>
<P>
   There is a significant window of opportunity for the new breed
of rockets. That's because NASA's attention, much of its budget,
and most of its shuttle launches will be directed for the next few
years toward the construction and servicing of the International
Space Station. That leaves most other space activities up to the
commercial sector, whose revenues from space activities already
exceed all government spending on the space program.
</P>
<P>
   The space station itself likely would never have survived its
protracted funding battles in Congress, if it hadn't been justified
by the need to provide a significant joint program with Russia to
help support their struggling space program. But while its
justification was geopolitical, its function will be almost
entirely scientific. As such, it stands as a tangible symbol of the
two major focuses of the nation's present space program: science
and international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will see growing international cooperation in scientific
research,'' NASA's Goldin told the Globe, ``but we will also see
new growth in a competitive commercial sector that will further
open the space frontier.''
</P>
<P>
   In the glory days of Apollo, says MIT's Young, ``science was
number 2 or 3. If we learned something scientific about the moon,
that was a byproduct.'' But things have changed dramatically: Now,
he says, ``NASA has become a servant of the scientific and
commercial sector in space. . . . They have become the enablers.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, on the very anniversary of NASA's crowning
moment, the agency will be launching a space shuttle mission that
perhaps symbolizes the new NASA of today. It is a purely scientific
mission: a new ``great observatory'' to join the hugely successful
Hubble Space Telescope. It's also the first shuttle flight
commanded by a woman. Poised for launch just a little after
midnight tonight (July 20), the Chandra X-ray observatory, unlike
past projects, was designed and managed by scientists and engineers
from academic institutions, chiefly the Smithsonian Astrophysical
Observatory and Harvard University, and will be controlled entirely
from a new center in Cambridge's Kendall Square. NASA, though
paying the bills, will have little direct involvement.
</P>
<P>
   That's a positive step, many analysts say. But it's not enough.
There is still no clear focus, no goal that the agency's efforts
are directed toward as they were with Apollo.
</P>
<P>
   Human missions to Mars could be developed for no more money than
what NASA has saved in recent years by doing things more
efficiently, said Robert Zubrin, president of Pioneer Astronautics
and author of ``The Case for Mars.'' It would take only about 20
percent more than is being spent now with no clear goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having them do nothing,'' he said, ``is almost as expensive as
having them storm heaven.''

GLINTS OF PEACE FROM NORTHERN IRELAND 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NANCY PELOSI  
 c.1999 San Francisco  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ On the train ride from Dublin to
Belfast, everything looks beautiful and serene. The lush green
countryside and sparkling coastline are the makings of an Irish
ballad. The landscape looks peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, however, politics enters the picture with the occasional
Union Jack and the infamous Red Hand of Ulster. As the train pulls
out of Portadown, the graceful steeple of Drumcree Church belies
the turmoil on the ground. As we draw closer, the train window
frames a picture of children at play, security forces in tanks, and
hedges of razor wire.
</P>
<P>
   The protagonists in this drama are the Protestant Orangemen,
whose annual marches have provoked violence in the Catholic
neighborhood of Garvaghy Road. This year the stakes are higher than
ever because of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement and ``The Way
Forward'' announced earlier this month by Prime Ministers Bertie
Ahern of Ireland and Tony Blair of Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of a U.S. congressional delegation, I met with
families of the Garvaghy Residence Association. One mother,
commenting on the taunts of the Orangemen, said, ``How can I teach
my children not to be bigots?'' Another was quoted as saying, ``I
hate them for making me hate them.''
</P>
<P>
   We also met with the Orangemen, who claimed that their marches
are professions of faith, not political provocations. The marches
culminated on July 12 to commemorate the Battle of the Boyne, the
1690 victory of the Protestant William III of Orange over the
Catholic King James II. In the name of religion, lives have been
lost and the opportunity for peace could be squandered.
</P>
<P>
   As we drove through the Protestant Shankill Road section of
Belfast, the local people were preparing for the July 12
observations of marches and bonfires. And then, suddenly, a ray of
hope.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the bustle, we spot an elderly woman stretched
out on a beach chair sunbathing, completely oblivious to the
political tensions swirling around her. She looks peaceful _ an
island of serenity near the so-called Peace Line dividing the
Protestant and Catholic sections of West Belfast. This Peace Line
is the last standing wall of division in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing the Peace Line wall reminded me of a speech that John
Hume, the Nobel Prize-winning leader of the moderate Catholic
Social Democratic and Labor Party, made at my home in 1990. He said
that both sides of the troubles must take down the walls in their
minds and hearts. Only then can the physical divisions come down.
Hume reiterated that message when we met with him in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   An advocate of non-violence, he said that violence has only
served to deepen the divisions in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of July, my family was in Ireland for the
christening of our grandson. At Sunday Mass on July 4, during the
special intentions part of the ceremony, we were touched when an
Irish voice called for a blessing on the United States of America
on the occasion of our Independence Day. The next blessing called
for the Irish peace process to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the United States is involved in the peace process in
several important ways.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has made an Irish peace agreement a priority
of our foreign policy. Former Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell presided over the Good Friday Agreements, which advanced
the peace process considerably. And there is strong bipartisan
agreement in Congress for decommissioning weapons, reforming the
police force _ Royal Ulster Constabulary _ and supporting
cross-community economic development through the International Fund
for Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   I was especially interested in the Springvale Campus project.
</P>
<P>
   We visited the West Belfast site of this campus, which will
enroll 3,000 Protestant and Catholic students.
</P>
<P>
   It was encouraging to see unionists working with the elected
Sinn Fein member of the Assembly and other local leaders on behalf
of children. The vision of this new university campus is clear:
children from Falls Road and Chankill Road will traverse Springvale
Road together.
</P>
<P>
   The site near the Peace Line wall was chosen specifically to
bring students together near their homes to raise the level of
trust among them. At last, a reason to be hopeful and the United
States is part of it.
</P>
<P>
   Next stop, Stormont Castle. The original Northern Ireland
Parliament Building was inaugurated in 1932 and is now the seat of
the newly elected Northern Ireland Assembly. The castle was the
venue in late June and early July for marathon negotiations under
the leadership of Ahern and Blair. For days they worked with the
political parties to resolve differences.
</P>
<P>
   On July 2, the prime ministers announced ``The Way Forward'' to
decommission arms and establish an inclusive executive, with
ministers nominated by July 15 and with devolution legislation laid
before the British Parliament soon thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   When we met with the Assembly members of the 10 leading parties
at Stormont, they were hopeful that the peace process would stay on
course. A great deal depended on the leadership of David Trimble
and his ability to persuade his Ulster Unionist Party to share
power with the Catholics of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   (Last week, the peace effort suffered a setback. Ireland's major
Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, refused to nominate
ministers for the new provincial administration _ or to even attend
a meeting of the Belfast legislature convened especially to fill 10
of 12 cabinet posts.)
</P>
<P>
   In other conversations, the British Secretary of State for
Northern Ireland, Mo Mowlan, whom the unionists wish to oust, said,
``The people demand peace, the leaders must have the courage to
make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, sounded optimistic, saying,
``It's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahern said failure to bridge the gap would be ``unforgivable,
unexplainable.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that actions taken by Sinn Fein should be acknowledged
as hugely positive and constructive. He also paid tribute to Blair
and others for their patience, persistence, and political courage.
</P>
<P>
   Blair warned, ``The entire civilized world will not understand
if we can't put this together and make it work. They would simply
not understand and rightly so.''
</P>
<P>
   The children of Northern Ireland have inherited a history of
conflict. That legacy of fear must be replaced by the prospect of
hope. Guns must be taken out of politics in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians must have the courage to take risks for peace _ for
the children.

ROYAL GARDEN PARTY? WE WERE NOT AMUSED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Not everybody gets invited to the queen's summer garden
parties. This year, for example, there were only 24,000 of us.
</P>
<P>
   Like many aspects of the monarchy, just who gets invited and why
is cloaked in mystery. But it is considered a big deal, so when the
lord chamberlain dropped us a line saying Queen Elizabeth had
commanded him to invite us to her party, who were we to say no?
</P>
<P>
   To most people, Buckingham Palace is that big, imposing place at
the end of the Mall, where Green Park and St. James Park meet, and
where soldiers with big black furry hats walk around like robots
behind iron gates that are normally crammed with the faces of
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1803, Buckingham Palace has been the London home for
the royal family since 1837. Queen Victoria was the first monarch
to move in, and in the 1860s she started throwing tea parties in
the garden every summer for her aristocratic friends.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Queen Elizabeth opened Buckingham Palace to the public
to raise money to repair Windsor Castle, another of the royal
family's digs, which was destroyed by fire. It is widely believed
that once those repairs are paid for, the palace will again be
closed to the public. But the public is only allowed into 18 of the
palace's 661 rooms, and they are not let into the garden.
</P>
<P>
   There is a sizable minority in Britain that thinks the monarchy
is an outdated, expensive institution. Conscious of such feeling,
since taking the throne in 1952 Queen Elizabeth has used the garden
parties as a way to make the palace more accessible to ordinary
people, with about 8,000 attending each of the three parties she
hosts every July.
</P>
<P>
   Still, calling it a party is a stretch. This is not, by any
measure, the commoners hanging and banging with the royal family.
Two military bands at opposite ends of the garden play music, but
there is no singing or dancing. There is no alcohol. Cameras are
not allowed. And despite the huge numbers of people, the gathering
is decidedly subdued.
</P>
<P>
   Women are supposed to wear fancy hats. Men are required to wear
dark suits, and a declining number wear tails. Some men wear
military uniforms, and some guests from the former colonies wear
national dress.
</P>
<P>
   On the day we attended, the atmosphere could be described as
civil, but hardly festive. Those who spoke chatted in hushed tones.
There was an air of expectation, but no one quite seemed to know
what was going on, or how they were supposed to behave, except to
behave as if they were in the presence of royalty.
</P>
<P>
   There is some mixing, but not much. There are three separate tea
tents: a royal tent, where the aristocrats socialize; a diplomatic
tent, where government types and, inexplicably, journalists are
assigned places; and a huge main tent, where all but a few hundred
of the guests take their tea.
</P>
<P>
   A staff of more than 400 dishes out 20,000 finger sandwiches,
18,000 fruit tarts and buttered scones, 8,000 slices of chocolate
cake, 5,000 bridge rolls, 4,500 slices each of Dundee cake and
Majorca slice, 3,500 slices of Swiss roll, 3,500 small tubs of ice
cream, and 3,000 buttercake fingers. Some 27,000 cups of Maison
Lyons tea, a special blend of Darjeeling and Assam leaves that
tastes of peaches and muscat grapes, are brewed.
</P>
<P>
   Many people, however, didn't bother to sample the fare. The
absence of napkins did not encourage people to try the sticky
stuff. Besides, most were too busy trying to get a close-up glimpse
of the royals.
</P>
<P>
   The guests know the royals have arrived when the band breaks
into ``God Save the Queen.'' That's the national anthem, not the
Sex Pistols song of the same name which takes a rather cynical view
of the monarch. A group of men wearing formal dress, described by
palace officials as gentlemen at arms but looking more like royal
bouncers, form lanes for the royal family to move through the
garden.
</P>
<P>
   The Queen Mother, or Queen Mum as she is known here, was the
first to make an appearance, walking gingerly on an artificial hip
and aided by a cane. At 98, she has reached icon status, and is
routinely applauded more warmly than any other member of the royal
family.
</P>
<P>
   The Queen's husband, Prince Philip, the duke of Edinburgh, was
next, striding purposefully across the finely cut lawn. His son,
Prince Andrew, made a more informal, entry, stopping to say hello
to some friends in the adjoining diplomatic tent. He said ``Jolly
well'' to one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the hostess, wearing a smart, understated mint-colored
dress, appeared and a round of applause wafted over the garden. An
hour later, the royal family left the royal tea tent to more
applause.
</P>
<P>
   As the queen looked our way, there was eye contact, and there
was a temptation to yell out, ``You were great in that Naked Gun
movie!'' But, like the fruit tart, it was a temptation not tasted.

NATION'S LIBRARY WANTS TO SHELVE BOOKS BY SIZE, NOT SUBJECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The biggest debate on Capitol Hill _ the one that
tells us most about our national character, the one that offers the
insight into the national mind _ is not about the future of
Medicare, or how to use the budget surplus, or whether taxes should
be cut, or whether defense spending ought to rise.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest debate on Capitol Hill is over whether books ought
to be shelved by size.
</P>
<P>
   The argument is raging only yards from the Capitol, in the
national library _ or, more precisely, in Congress's library _ and
it is being joined with as much passion as any floor debate in the
House, and watched with as much attention as any mark-up session in
a Senate appropriations subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Shelving books by size, rather than content, is the idea of some
administrators of the library, which is awash in books. Too many
books. If all the large books were together on big shelves, all the
small books would be together on small shelves, there would be no
gaping holes _ lost space _ in between. Such a plan could, say its
supporters, increase shelf availability by as much as 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but at what cost? At stake is the place of the written word
in the American imagination; the nation's devotion to the fine and
practiced art of browsing, even in the amazon.com age; the
scholar's impulse to break learning into subject areas; the
researcher's conviction that a truth, if not necessarily the truth,
can be stumbled upon if only a liberated mind is let loose amongst
the stacks of a great library.
</P>
<P>
   The debate is stirring unusual bitterness inside the ordinarily
tranquil study carrels and stacks, which hold 115,506,000 items,
including more than 17,772,400 books.
</P>
<P>
   The very idea of shelving books by size _ the notion of putting
the big ones in one section of the library and the little ones
somewhere else _ is anathema to book lovers, researchers, and
scholars. It is a dagger at the heart of the bibliophile's pastime,
browsing. And it is a threat to the greatest delight of the
researcher, serendipity.
</P>
<P>
   But it is more than that. It screams order in a world where
learning only serves to underline the persistence of disorder. It
imposes neatness on the messy turmoil of the mind. It celebrates
efficiency in a realm of human endeavor where the great harvests
often come amid chaotic inefficiency.
</P>
<P>
   So far scores of Library of Congress librarians, the Library of
Congress Professional Association, and Local 2910 of the American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees have howled in
protest. In truth, even the people floating the idea aren't wild
about it. But it hasn't gone away.
</P>
<P>
   Neither have the library's space problems. Indeed, they've only
become greater.
</P>
<P>
   Take a few steps into Deck 9 of the John Adams Building, one of
the three massive structures the library maintains on Capitol Hill,
and you'll see why. Pause at the QA 76 section, where books on
computers are collected. So many books sit on the floor that a pair
of size 11 loafers cannot navigate the tiny space remaining between
the stacks. A small leak from the sprinklers would convey some of
the world's most sophisticated mathematical thought to damp
oblivion; the books sit directly beneath the water spouts.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on the floor, the back cover at a 45-degree angle and
the spine under enormous strain, is a copy of the fourth edition of
Stephen Wolfram's ``The Mathematica.'' This is a book in the throes
of destruction in the world's greatest book collection, dedicated
above all to preservation.
</P>
<P>
   Down on Deck 7 of the stacks the situation is little better.
There, amid the neatly stacked collections of the library's justly
celebrated Asia collection, is the space problem displayed in stark
and unforgiving light. On the shelves are thousands of books,
assembled crisply by subject. But around the shelves themselves, in
a scene more evocative of an industrial launderer than a national
library, are 21 massive yellow tubs, strewn full of books, piled
every which way, their jagged edges forming a forbidding glacier
field of knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   This crisis in the rarefied air of the Library of Congress is
not a testimony to the sloth of the library's 4,213 employees, nor
a dramatic demonstration that the library's annual federal
appropriation (some $400 million) is too small. It is simply a
measure of the explosion of information, publications, monographs,
newspapers, pamphlets, maps, moving images, photographs, posters,
prints, and drawings.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly the problem is books. The book collection of the
world's biggest library _ half the collection is in languages other
than English, 460 in all _ is growing by about 300,000 volumes a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're running out of space,'' complains Steven Herman, the
chief of the collection-management division of the library. ``We
have to see if we can make the most efficient use of the shelves we
have now.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no prospect of getting more space on Capitol Hill; there
simply is no more space on Capitol Hill, and because the Library
attracts about 2 million people a year _ making it one of the
biggest attractions for tourists in the capital _ the notion of
moving the Gutenberg Bible and the Giant Bible of Mainz, both
produced in Germany in the 15th century, from their current
locations is unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   In desperation _ quiet desperation, as Henry David Thoreau might
put it _ the library already is taking some significant steps to
expand its shelf space. In 14 months the library will open a huge
off-site storage space in Fort Meade, Md., which should relieve
some of the pressure _ but at a price. The Fort Meade space will
not be open to browsing, and any book that a researcher requests
won't be available on Capitol Hill for half a day, maybe longer.
The library is planning two delivery runs a day from its new
state-of-the-art building (modern security, sophisticated
temperature and humidity controls) but researchers in Washington
for only a day are almost certainly going to be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   A special library task force has come up with a number of
options to ease the strain. One is double-shelving, or placing a
smaller row of books in front of a larger row. The library already
employs a similar technique, and so the researcher rummaging
through the official papers of the State of Ohio is going to find
the volume containing the Senate Journal of 1896 sitting behind the
House Journal of 1894 on the shelf; this works only because the
volumes are chronological and of uniform size.
</P>
<P>
   But the real way to save space may be to shelve the books by
size. Each book would have a fixed place on a fixed shelf. No need
to keep some empty space at the end of the shelf in the
anticipation that new works might be on the way. No need to worry
just where that new volume should rest, between which other
volumes.
</P>
<P>
   They'd go in, all in a row, catalogued precisely by computer, so
that the researcher looking for a copy of James Morris's ``Pax
Britannica'' or Carl Yastrzemski and Al Hirshberg's ``Yaz'' would
know exactly where to look. Moreover, William L. Shirer's ``The
Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,'' Dr. Suess's ``The Cat in the
Hat,'' and John P. Marquand's ``The Late George Apley'' might be
sitting there right beside each other, being roughly the same size.
</P>
<P>
   Herman knows the plan has some disadvantages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get questions no one else can answer,'' he says. ``One of
the ways to answer them to to go to a section of the stacks and fan
through tables of contents or indexes and look. It's a lot easier
to look up something on lighthouses, for example, if you can just
go to one place and browse. It's easier to go to a shelf and see
exactly what's in the books.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some very good arguments for continuing that,'' he
says. ``But it takes up significant amounts of space.''
</P>
<P>
   But the argument about shelving books by size is worth having,
not only because the great surge in printed material is causing a
problem that many libraries _ from Harvard and Cornell to the
national libraries of France and Britain _ can no longer avoid. It
is worth having, too, because it raises important questions about
the human mind and the human spirit.
</P>
<P>
   And so now on Capitol Hill, so often the site for discussions
trite and trivial, the topic finally has turned to a clash of real
values, to a subject that has enduring significance, to a topic
that, more than most others, defines who we are, and how we
conserve the things that we value the most.
</P>
<P>
   This debate is occasioned, like most of the important debates of
the last quarter-century, by a deficit of some sort. But this one,
unlike the budget deficit (which has been slain) and the trade
deficit (which persists amid our prosperity), doesn't exist
primarily in accounting ledgers. It exists in real, physical space.

BUSH THRIVES AS SCANDAL HUNT GOES ON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For months, the opponents of Republican
presidential front-runner George W. Bush have been whispering to
reporters that the Texas governor is on the verge of being tripped
by a scandal. Something would develop from Bush's acknowledged
heavy drinking, or his avoidance of combat duty, or his refusal to
say whether he had used illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, given Bush's overwhelming financial strength, as well as
his decision last week to forgo federal funds for his primary
campaign and thus avoid spending limits, some analysts think the
only way to beat Bush is to unearth some kind of personal scandal.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, after many media organizations have scrutinized
Bush's biography for several months, there have been no blockbuster
revelations, although there have been more than a few
embarrassments. Bush, instead of faltering, has thrived, and the
GOP field last week shrank by two candidates, as Representative
John Kasich of Ohio dropped out and Senator Bob Smith of New
Hampshire left the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Bush campaign knows that everyone from the Republican
opponents to the Democratic National Committee to the media will
continue to investigate Bush's background. The Bush campaign has
already conducted its own informal investigation of the candidate's
life to be prepared for any questions. After six months of
questioning from the national press corps, campaign officials are
so confident that no harmful material will turn up that they
welcome investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can dig around all they want, and they should,'' said
Ron Kaufman, the White House political director under President
George Bush and a family friend for 23 years. ``That's part of the
game, that is part of the rules. But they won't find anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman knows as well as anyone in politics how presumptuous it
can be to hope that an opponent's background will determine the
outcome of the race. When President Bush ran for reelection in
1992, many Bush aides were overly confident that Bill Clinton's
avoidance of the draft or his alleged extramarital affairs would do
him in.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the allegations of Clinton's affair with
Gennifer Flowers were true. And, the president went on to have a
relationship with White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky that
resulted in his impeachment but not his removal from office. The
result, according to political analysts, is that the standards for
the conduct of prospective presidents have been greatly lowered.
</P>
<P>
   In Bush's case, lowering the ethical bar may have helped. If a
candidate surfaced a decade ago who acknowledged being a onetime
heavy drinker and served in the National Guard during the Vietnam
War, he might have had a tough time making it through the
primaries. Bush fits that description. But if Clinton could
overcome his personal background and win election, the thinking
goes, then Bush can, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton's indiscretions have numbed the public,'' said
political analyst Stuart Rothenberg. ``You'd need to find an
awfully large indiscretion to be a major political problem for
Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Rothenberg, referring to Bush's statement that he has reformed
since his ``young and irresponsible'' days, said Bush has sought to
inoculate himself by vaguely acknowledging bad behavior and
promising ``he won't do it as president.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the Bush campaign has fended off questions
about a variety of incidents with well-prepared answers.
</P>
<P>
   When reporters asked how Bush was able to join a Texas Air
National Guard unit during the Vietnam War and not see combat, the
campaign produced a former Guard official who swore that Bush was
not given special treatment to get into the unit. When a political
opponent leaked real estate records that showed Bush once purchased
property restricted to white people, the campaign quickly responded
that Bush never knew about the covenant and noted it was null and
void under Texas law.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has also acted swiftly to rein in his staff, resulting in
this week's departure of David Beckwith as his communications
director. Beckwith had served as press secretary for Vice President
Dan Quayle, now a Bush primary opponent.
</P>
<P>
   While the Bush campaign officials won't say publicly what they
disliked about Beckwith, some privately pointed to what they
considered his low-balling of Bush's campaign receipts. The
campaign also apparently was upset with Beckwith's comment to the
Austin American-Statesman about the upcoming Iowa straw poll.
``This isn't a caucus,'' Beckwith was quoted as saying. ``A caucus
is bad enough. You sit there for four hours in the fire station.
This is give-up-an-entire-Saturday in the middle of summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush denied that he fired Beckwith, saying the spokesman had
resigned by mutual agreement. ``It just didn't work,'' Bush said,
cutting off questions about the matter at a Washington news
conference Wednesday. Beckwith could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Bush's opponents believe the public only now is becoming
aware of the contrast between Bush's early years and his more
recent call for a ``moral line in the sand'' and an era of
responsibility. At various times in recent weeks, Bush has urged
people to abstain from premarital sex and to stay away from alcohol
and illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's Republican opponents, many of whom have openly
attacked Clinton for his personal problems, have so far said little
or nothing about Bush's life. While several GOP campaigns
acknowledged they are investigating Bush, they insisted they are
not probing his personal life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we doing research? Sure,'' said Greg Mueller, a top
adviser to GOP candidate Steve Forbes. ``But our emphasis is on his
record and what he said on the campaign trail,'' Mueller said,
drawing attention to what he called Bush's 75 tax hikes as
governor.
</P>
<P>
   As for Bush's past, ``the media are doing a good job of looking
in this,'' Mueller said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, reporters from many news organizations, including the
supermarket tabloids, have spent months investigating Bush. The
governor himself may be responsible for questions about possible
drug use because he has refrained from answering questions about
whether he had ever used cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   When a Bush aide was asked recently why the governor has refused
to say whether he used illegal drugs, the aide followed the
governor's lead by not commenting. Instead, the aide e-mailed a
newspaper article that said no evidence of drug use could be found.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in an interview earlier this year, said he would stick by
his refusal to comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people who have been checking into my background will
find that I have probably been more tough on myself than I should
be,'' Bush said. ``This is a world of rumors and gossip. When
campaigns get cranked up, people start floating all kinds of rumors
and gossip about candidates. And I am certainly not immune to that
. . .
</P>
<P>
   ``So when I get asked pointed questions, I'm going to remind
people that I made mistakes in the past. And the question is, have
I learned from those mistakes, not what you did 20 or 30 years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Rothenberg, the analyst, said it seems likely that damaging
information about Bush would have surfaced by now if it exists.
Then again, Rothenberg said, if there is such information, ``a
smart opposition research guy will say, `Why should we use it now?
Wait a while.' ''

DRAWING A LINE IN SHIFTING SAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN MCNAMARA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a moment, just imagine . . .
</P>
<P>
   It is spring 1985. Congress is debating aid to Senator Jesse
Helms's favorite cause when word comes that North Carolina's public
television station gave its donor list to the cash-strapped
Nicaraguan Contras.
</P>
<P>
   Or, it is spring 1999. Congress is about to take up gun control
legislation when news leaks that Colorado's public television
station traded contributor lists with the National Rifle
Association.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment, imagine whether we would have been more or less
outraged than we were last week when we learned that WBGH-TV in
Boston has for years been handing over the names of its donors to
the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Those who breathed a sigh of relief after public television
greed-heads in New York and Washington, D.C., acknowledged swapping
donor lists with Republicans, too, missed the broader damage done
by the Public Broadcasting System. The real crime _ whether or not
the Internal Revenue Service finds any technical violation of laws
governing tax-exempt organizations _ is that PBS confirmed public
cynicism that, in modern American politics, not even Big Bird can
be trusted.
</P>
<P>
   When the list swap was originally revealed in a Globe story in
May, WGBH attributed a single incident _ an abuse of its own policy
against such a use of donor lists _ to a junior employee. In
hearings last week, Democrats expressed regret at the mistake, but
quickly turned their fury on ``partisan'' Republicans who
threatened to hold up PBS funding. WGBH took some of the
righteousness out of that anger when it had to admit providing
thousands of names to Democrats over several years.
</P>
<P>
   Why shouldn't we be cynical, when each side claims the moral
high ground but both are rolling around in the same muck? To use a
metaphor of the moment, if you're going to paint the enemy as Darth
Maul, you'd better convince us you're a Jedi Knight.
</P>
<P>
   That was a tough sell for Democrats on a number of fronts last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the huffing about the announcement by Governor George
W. Bush of Texas that he will decline federal matching funds in the
Repubican presidential campaign. The feds provide $250 for every
$1,000 a candidate raises, in exchange for a candidate's agreement
to a spending cap. Having already raised $37 million, Bush said he
doesn't need Washington's money.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats want us to see this as a violation of the spirit of
campaign finance laws. They might have made more of it, had Bush's
announcement not come the same day a group of New York Democrats
vowed to raise $25 million to help Hillary Clinton win a US Senate
seat from New York. If the First Lady is willing to participate in
what is sure to be the most expensive congressional campaign in
history, it's hard to take a clean shot at George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   And what about the plea from the Democratic state representative
from Minnesota who urged a judge to release Kathleen Ann Soliah on
bail because the attempted murders of which she is accused occurred
25 years ago, in another life, in a very different time in America?
</P>
<P>
   Soliah was a member of the Symbionese Liberation Army in 1974,
when she is alleged to have stashed two pipe bombs, neither of
which exploded, under Los Angeles police cars in retaliation for
the deaths of SLA members killed during a shootout with police.
Soliah spent her years as a fugitive living as a doctor's wife,
community activist, and devoted mother in St. Paul, where she is
known as Sara Jane Olson.
</P>
<P>
   Like Katherine Ann Power before her, Soliah makes a compelling
case for a life on the run that was peacefully lived, far from the
turbulent politics of a divisive decade. But couldn't Byron De La
Beckwith have made a similar plea during his trial for the murder
of Medgar Evers in Mississippi? Could he have convinced us in 1994
that in 1963 he was another man, in a segregated South, during a
turbulent, divisive time in America? Not a chance. When he was
convicted, we thought, finally, justice has been done.
</P>
<P>
   It is a complicated business, applying our principles. Before we
endorse that buffer zone Massachusetts lawmakers are proposing to
keep protesters away from abortion clinics, don't we need to ask
ourselves how that position squares with our outrage at the
incarceration of Philip Berrigan for pouring blood on
missile-launching equipment to protest nuclear weapons?
</P>
<P>
   The battle for the high ground is hard to fight if you are
standing on shifting sand.

NOT THE GERMANS ALONE 
A Son's Search for the Truth of Vichy 
By Isaac Levendel. Northwestern University Press. 341 pp. $25.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The responsibility for evil deeds seems relatively easy to
assign in such cases as the Littleton, Colo., killings or the
Oklahoma City bombing. But in such vast crimes as the Holocaust,
even knowing who all the guilty are, much less calling them to
account, is impossible. That is the grievous theme of ``Not the
Germans Alone,'' Isaac Levendel's cathartic but anguished book
about his search for those who killed his mother in Vichy France.
</P>
<P>
   One begins with Hitler and his henchmen, the judges,
bureaucrats, and civic officials who implemented his ideas; the
generals and lesser officers and enlisted men; police chiefs;
chemical-company executives who made the poison gas, gas chambers,
and crematoria; railway executives who provided the transportation;
minor clerks and guards, civilians who informed on neighbors or
refused to aid them, etc.
</P>
<P>
   The responsibility spreads outward like rings in a pond, and
includes not only Germans but also willing or tacit accomplices in
all of the countries overwhelmed by the Nazi beast. But in the
occupied countries, justice in many cases was never done; fatigue,
cost, the desire to rebuild or meet new challenges like the Soviet
threat, shame and fear or the craving to forget prompted many with
marked consciences, as well as many traumatized survivors, to try
to bury the past under a blanket of silence.
</P>
<P>
   It was this silence that Isaac Levendel, a French-born Jew who
has lived in the United States since 1974, could bear no longer.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1944 in Avignon, in a part of France ruled by the Vichy
regime, Levendel and his mother had fled the increasing pressure on
French Jews by hiding at a small cherry farm away from Le Pontet,
the town where she owned a small business. Her husband, Isaac's
father, had been safely interned in neutral Switzerland when his
French Army unit was driven there by the German onslaught of 1940.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Levendel had reason to feel fairly safe, but against the
vehement arguments of the farmer's wife, she made up her mind to go
back to Le Pontet to settle business and gather some of her
possessions. She never returned. Arrested June 6, 1944, she was
deported to Drancy, a transit camp near Paris, and from there to
Auschwitz, where she was gassed on July 4. Her only child was 8.
</P>
<P>
   Protected by Jewish and Christian families, Isaac Levendel
survived the war, but the disappearance of his mother gnawed at him
for 45 years. When his father returned at war's end and tried to
put the past behind and get on with his life, Isaac regarded him
coldly as one who wished to violate the son's devotion to his
mother's memory. Yet as a young man in France he could not bear to
seek the truth about her death, avoiding the scenes where it had
occurred and even the people who had protected him. He refused any
help from the postwar German reparations program: ``I could not
accept anything in exchange for the loss of my mother,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1957 Isaac emigrated to Israel, worked for years on a
kibbutz, married and became a father. And then in the mid-1970s he
and his family came to the United States, settling near Chicago.
(He is described in the book only as a ``computer technologist and
manager.'') As the decades passed, he could not live with the
silence in himself, and in 1989, after reading about the work of
Serge Klarsfeld, a Parisian lawyer who specialized in research into
the fate of the French Jews, he contacted Klarsfeld and learned
that his mother had been on a particular well-documented transport
of French Jews, No. 76, from Drancy to Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   Discarding his long-held resistance, Levendel became determined
to find out the whole story. During several visits to France in the
early 1990s, he found an eyewitness to his mother's arrest. Several
French-speaking men arrested her in her house, and when she ran out
to the home of a neighbor (the witness), they followed her. She
begged them not to take her, shouting at them, ``You have no
hearts,'' but they replied, ``We have hearts, but they are made of
steel.'' She tried to commit suicide with a knife, but they grabbed
her and hauled her away.
</P>
<P>
   Levendel found a woman who had been with his mother at the
Avignon jail where the arrested ones were held before deportation.
She recalled ``the woman from Le Pontet who had left a little boy
and was crying without respite. . . . `I have left my son behind. .
. . I do not know where he is. . . . I will never see him again.'
'' Another witness, a woman who survived Auschwitz, recalled seeing
Sarah Levendel arrive there, as Levendel writes, ``sick and
indifferent,'' and remembered that she had been immediately gassed.
</P>
<P>
   One of Levendel's agonies had been relieved: He knew now what
had happened to his mother. The next question was, who did it? He
had always assumed that Germans had seized his mother. But the
latter third of his book reflects his confrontation with the brutal
fact that the perpetrators were mostly French, that one official
who had supervised the fingering and roundups of Jews was
rehabilitated after the war and even styled himself a victim of the
Germans, and that those in charge of the Vichy archives as late as
the 1990s were reluctant to give an outsider access to the facts
that might clear up the mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   Levendel's efforts coincided with legal action by Klarsfeld to
overcome bureaucratic resistance to full disclosure of the details
of collaboration. In the face of official noncooperation, Levendel
finally got a minor clerk in the Veterans Affairs department to
send him, against the rules, a copy of the identification card
issued to his mother at the Drancy camp. The card bears the
classification ``B,'' which meant, ``Complete Jew . . .
deportable.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his continuing efforts, Levendel never identified the
men who arrested his mother. But he suspects they were part of a
French criminal gang active in the area, the Palmieris, who carried
out arrests for the Gestapo in exchange for 1,000 francs per Jew
and the right to plunder the homes of their victims. A few hours
after Sarah Levendel's arrest, he writes, ``French militiamen had
come with a truck and emptied our house and the store of
merchandise and valuables.''
</P>
<P>
   Isaac Levendel's well-written and well-documented account (alas,
it lacks an index, which would have been helpful given the quantity
of names and details) is full of anger _ at the murderous French
lackeys of the Nazis, at those who turned away and would not try to
save the Jews, at the bureaucrats who still try to whitewash the
truth, at the anti-Semitic Catholic leaders who tacitly approved of
the campaign against the Jews. But, most poignant, it is also clear
that he retained for all those years a deep-seated anger at his
mother for going back into danger, and guilt that he did not go
with her or try to stop her. It was these pains, it seems, more
than simply the longing to know what happened, that his discoveries
did much to assuage.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could go back in time,'' he writes, ``it is clear that I
would be faced with a decision impossible for an eight-year-old. I
would have to choose between two equally terrifying alternatives:
accompanying my mother to the gas chamber or losing her forever by
staying at the cherry farm. It is, of course, her misjudgment that
would thrust me into my inextricable dilemma: no way could I make
the choice. But after many years of anger and resentment, I have
become able to understand her side of the tragedy. Learning the
details of her fate has been a great relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Isaac Levendel has relieved the silence for himself and, with
this book, for his readers. But he still has a fear, even now, of
another kind of silence, the silence of the ages. In 1992 he
visited Auschwitz for the first time, and walked amid overwhelming
emotions the path that his mother had walked from the railhead to
the gas chamber. In his book he writes, ``At Passover the year
after my return from Auschwitz, our family held the usual seder.
But I was unable to read the Haggadah aloud and retell, as I
usually do, the story of the exodus from Egypt. As I silently read
the text, I measured the distance separating me from the Jews in
Egypt and realized how abstract my own story would sound to the
distant generations to come.''

`GRAVEYARD' REVELS IN OLD CREOLE AMBIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CLEA SIMON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
GRAVEYARD DUST 
By Barbara Hambly 
Bantam Books, $23.95, 315 pp. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Benjamin January has a problem. Everything he wants to do,
everything he is trained to do, comes into conflict with another
part of him _ or with his world. Educated as a doctor, he is
allowed to practice only when the worst yellow fever or cholera
hits his native New Orleans. And though he's a devout Catholic, he
must find a way to defend a voodooienne, a practitioner of the
African-based religion he considers sinful. To make his situation
trickier still, January _ doctor, musician, and de facto amateur
detective _ is a free man of color in 1830s New Orleans, a
Parisian-trained sophisticate who is relearning the ropes in a city
newly invaded by white Americans who do not understand the
traditional differences between the city's black citizens and its
slaves.
</P>
<P>
   That's the set-up for Barbara Hambly's ``Graveyard Dust,'' the
third in the Benjamin January series. Like its predecessors, the
excellent ``Free Man of Color'' and its follow-up ``Fever Season,''
this new book revels in atmosphere: the sound of voodoo drums, the
smell of rum or sweat, and the heavy feel of the hot, wet air.
Because January has only recently returned to his boyhood home, he
experiences New Orleans anew, and Hambly's rich prose welcomes her
readers through his eyes to the ``dim wakening clamor of the
levees'' and the ballrooms with ``air . . . waxy and thick as
ambergris.''
</P>
<P>
   Leavened with solid research about the Creole culture and
19th-century history, this heady writing makes for some chilling
adventures as January seeks to clear the voodooienne, his beloved
sister Olympe, of murder and to come to terms with his new world.
The plot complications _ such as the fact that there may not be a
body for the supposedly murdered man _ just add to the mix of
reality and magic, as in the chase scene where ``Sweat poured from
him and the blood beat in his head, and around him the woods
chittered with ghosts and loa (voodoo gods) and the twitching white
leprous shape of the smallpox god.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, all that atmosphere and those complications tend
to obscure some of the novel's basic mystery. Hambly's setup is
straightforward and compelling, asking not only whether a man was
murdered and by whom, but whether an African-American woman can get
justice (throwing in a deadly deadline as city inhabitants flee a
possible cholera epidemic). But, more so than in her previous
January novels, her loose ends and red herrings _ such as the
banking turmoil of the era _ distract a bit from the clues and the
chase.
</P>
<P>
   Also, as in the other books, there is the issue of race outside
the book's cover, since it may strike readers as odd that a white
writer places herself in a black persona. It may help that some,
though certainly not all, the indignities faced by January are
similar to those confronting women. True, Hambly's detective must
cope with much greater physical dangers _ including that of being
kidnapped and sold as a slave because of his skin color _ but the
snide comments, the regular derision of his opinions, and the
automatic belittling of his intellect are common enough to sound
real in Hambly's hands.
</P>
<P>
   No, more of an issue for a casual reader of mysteries is whether
January's search will get lost in the metaphoric cipriere (cypress
swamp) that has grown up around her hero, the diversions and moral
issues that threaten his world view. For readers who can find their
way through the multiple worlds of magic and reality, city and
bayou, however, ``Graveyard Dust'' offers a pleasant escape from
present-day reality. And for New Orleans devotees, the settings are
irresistible. ``Graveyard Dust'' may not stand up to its
predecessors, but it still has enough magic to possess its readers.

DEAR GOVERNOR: THINK ABOUT THE CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Dear Gov. Gray Davis:
</P>
<P>
   Because you said you wanted to be ``the education governor'' of
California, I am writing to you on behalf of some 50,000 San
Francisco school children in grades kindergarten through nine.
</P>
<P>
   Could you and your pals in Sacramento please knock off the
finger pointing long enough to see that you are punishing a whole
lot of kids down here because a handful of adults once made some
questionable choices?
</P>
<P>
   On June 23, at about 4:45 a.m. _ yes, a.m. _ the San Francisco
Board of Education unanimously but miserably approved a
substantially shrunken $533 million budget for 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
   Gone from that sum was the money to pay for _ surprise, surprise
_ what little remained of this city's elementary school arts
programs ($650,000). Gone too was the money to pay for an extended
day, or seventh period, for middle school students ($4.5 million).
</P>
<P>
   That extra hour may not seem like such a loss, but when you
raise academic standards for graduation _ as San Francisco Unified
School District did awhile back _ it makes a huge difference for
thousands of kids who need all the learning time they can get.
</P>
<P>
   As for the arts programs, how can we pretend to be an advanced,
let alone civilized, society and keep treating art and music as if
they are luxurious fluff? Worse, how can we continue to do this
during the flushest economic times in the history of the state?
</P>
<P>
   As school board member Jill Wynns said after the pre-dawn budget
vote: ``The state is drowning in tax money, and we're cutting core,
essential programs in San Francisco. We hate this budget. But we
had no choice, no options.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, governor, I know you many not think much of anybody who
sits on the San Francisco board. A few of your recent vetoes stand
as monuments to your disappointment. Those vetoes _ worth millions
to San Francisco Unified _ gave the board little choice but to cut
the seventh period and the arts.
</P>
<P>
   Which gets us back to the bodies on the bottom of this pile: the
kids.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't their fault that San Francisco, like a lot of
California urban school districts, financed for years some
expansion projects and academic upgrades by sort of borrowing
against the bucks they were accustomed to getting _ sooner or later
_ from the feds and state for desegregation programs.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't the kids' fault that San Francisco's former
superintendent, Bill Rojas, performed this perfectly legal but
risky financial jukestep longer and more spiritedly than any other
superintendent, or that his cash-strapped board juked along so
docilely.
</P>
<P>
   Neither is it the kids' fault that Rojas' in-yo'-face,
gimme-the-bleeping-money style offended your predecessor, Pete
Wilson, half the Capitol and _ until he left for Dallas _ you.
</P>
<P>
   I've read enough to turn my eyeballs bloody about this stuff:
The overuse of the desegregation money; the Legislature's
retroactive rescission of California's share of the dough; your
vetoes of the Legislature's attempts to put back all or some of the
money.
</P>
<P>
   What a mess. Some people say the state OK'd and promised that
money to the schools and, by law, ought to pay up; some say new
laws supersede that. No doubt you will all spend the next 18 months
arguing about it, and many lawyers will get rich in the process.
</P>
<P>
   As the lawyers argue about the desegregation millions, guess
what will happen to the kids? They'll get the royal shaft.
</P>
<P>
   Although it amounts to a measly half-hour of instruction per
week for only about half the kids, San Francisco still has a shred
of a public grammar school music program. Do you know why? It isn't
thanks to the state. A one-time windfall blew into the city's
budget several years ago, was allocated for public school music
programs and got locked into the protective arms of Proposition J,
the Children's Amendment. It was a fluke.
</P>
<P>
   Governor, in your heart, that fact must strike you as shameful,
especially in a state whose legislators are contorting themselves
trying to find ways to ``give back'' a great budget surplus. Music
by fluke?
</P>
<P>
   Logic dictates that the more time a junior high kid spends in
class, the better chance she or he has to improve learning skills.
And numerous studies have proved that visual and musical arts
programs increase a child's overall learning ability and make for
better, healthier socialization.
</P>
<P>
   Please, governor, your vetoes show you have the power. Your
political record shows you know how to make things happen.
</P>
<P>
   Reimburse the desegregation funds or tap some other source.
Don't punish the kids. Find a way to do the right thing for them.
</P>

AUDRA MCDONALD FINDS HER OWN VOICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Audra McDonald won't let anyone declare boundaries for her, and
she won't set any for herself. Broadway's brightest female star,
with three Tonys to her credit while she is still in her 20s,
McDonald was trained for a career in opera at New York's
prestigious Juilliard School.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought classical training was a little like eating
broccoli,'' McDonald said recently during a conversation in a
Boston hotel the morning after an ``Evening at Pops'' taping that
blew the audience away. ``I didn't like the taste, but I knew it
was good for me.'' Within a single song, McDonald's uninhibited
soprano might loft a high D many an operatic diva might envy, then
growl out a low phrase like a down 'n' dirty blues singer, and
connect them, not only through a classical singer's breath support
but also through a jazz singer's sense of phrasing, a Broadway
singer's theatrical intensity, a gospel singer's soul-shaking
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald won her first Tony in 1993 for her performance as
Carrie in``Carousel''; her second, in 1996, for the young voice
student terrorized by Maria Callas in Terrence McNally's ``Master
Class''; her third for her portrayal of Sarah in ``Ragtime'' last
year.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald arrived on Broadway from within a secure sense of
herself and her goals, and not out of nowhere: She has been onstage
since she was 7 and she's been singing all her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all began in the Episcopalian Church in Fresno, Calif. I
was the loudest one in the choir,'' she admits, smiling over a
teacup with the same wattage that can dazzle the farthest reaches
of the second balcony, ``and not always on pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   When McDonald was 10, her sister won a trophy for swimming.
McDonald wanted a trophy too, or an accomplishment to claim as her
own, so she auditioned for a small cabaret ensemble that performed
in a local dinner theater. ``It was the best education I could ever
have had,'' McDonald says. ``We changed the show every eight weeks,
and I performed in it for seven years. We did salutes to Irving
Berlin or George Gershwin or other songwriters, or programs with
themes, like `Songs of World War II.' When I was 10, there I stood
singing `The White Cliffs of Dover.' I also took children's parts
in shows like `The King and I' and ``Hello, Dolly.' My only regret
is that I never got a trophy to show for it!'' She delivers this
line with mock drama, fully aware that the trophies, three of them
called Tonys, came later.
</P>
<P>
   When she was still enrolled in Roosevelt School for the
Performing Arts, McDonald won the title role in a production of
``Evita'' _ a decision that caused quite a stir back in Fresno. ``I
was 16 and black, and there were people who were very upset that I
had been cast. But Eva Peron was only 26 when she came to power,
and she was about the same color as me _ so much for casting
against type.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no professional musicians in McDonald's immediate
family, although her mother played the piano and her father had
been a music major in college. ``My dad was the principal of the
high school, which meant that he saw my grades before I did,'' she
said. Her mother is an affirmative action director at California
Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo. Music had run in
McDonald's family; five of her aunts had toured as a gospel
quintet, the McDonald Sisters.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Dreaming of Broadway
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's dream was to go to New York and become a Broadway
star. Her parents were uneasy at the thought of her alone in New
York and believed firmly in the value of education _ they wanted
her to have something to fall back on. She could go to New York if
she was accepted by the Juilliard School; the first thing her
father wanted to see after her graduation was her diploma.
</P>
<P>
   At Juilliard, McDonald studied with the lovely American soprano
of the 1950s, Ellen Faull; with Arthur Levy, who is the teacher of
the rising soprano Elizabeth Futral; and with Edith Bers. As an
undergraduate she was not allowed to sing in the school's mainstage
opera productions, but she could take part in workshop productions
of William Schuman's ``Casey at the Bat'' and Vaughan Williams's
``Hugh the Drover.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald did not feel she fit in at Juilliard and did not always
feel sure about what she was doing there. ``My teachers recognized
a classical voice in my instrument, and I worked on all the `ina'
roles, like Zerlina in `Don Giovanni' and Despina in `Cosi fan
tutte.' But I was very torn and conflicted; I could never give
myself over to the sound everyone wanted me to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, though, McDonald says she ``learned to accept my
full sound, to appreciate all the qualities of my voice, to let the
whole thing out. I learned to use my whole voice, instead of just
half of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Through a Juilliard mentor, language and repertory coach Thomas
Grubb, she discovered an affinity for the French vocal literature.
She was assigned to learn Poulenc's opera ``La voix humaine,'' in
which a woman is alone on the stage with a telephone as her life
falls apart; the part of Elle, the woman, is a vocal and dramatic
tour de force. When she sang it, Grubb explaimed, ``There you are _
at last we've found you.'' McDonald says she loves ``La voix
humaine'' to this day, and can't wait for the opportunity to
perform it professionally.
</P>
<P>
   Before her senior year, McDonald left school to enjoy what she
calls ``a mental vacation'' _ and she got her first big break. She
won the part of the Ayah in the national touring company of ``The
Secret Garden.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm going to say about the `Secret Garden' tour may sound
very strange, but it proved to me that the talent pool in this
county is very deep. In my little hometown, there were several
people who were just as talented as some of my friends in `The
Secret Garden.' ''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald returned to finish up at Juilliard after the tour; she
was already in the middle of the audition process for ``Carousel.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stressing the humanity
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I was chosen for Carrie, a part that is always played for
comic relief. But the director, Nick Hytner, told me that it would
be too easy just to play her for laughs; he helped me to bring out
her humanity, her struggle, and to explore why she chose security
over love,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The great opera star Shirley Verrett made her Broadway debut in
``Carousel,'' and she and McDonald became friends; they would do
their grocery shopping together after the show was over. Verrett
also helped McDonald prepare for her audition for ``Master Class,''
where the student has to sing one of Lady Macbeth's arias for Maria
Callas. Verrett had been the most successful Lady Macbeth after
Callas herself. ``I turned to her for help,'' McDonald says. ``When
I told her what I was going to have to sing, she said, `Oh, honey,
you'd better have some good high Cs for that.' She talked me
through the aria and the drama of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Onstage, McDonald held her own against the firestorm of Zoe
Caldwell, who was portraying Callas. ``I still say she was the best
leading man I ever had! She was always there, cheering me on; I
feel that for two years I was sitting in a master class with Zoe. I
learned so much from her; I was constantly asking her questions,
trying to break through certain moments, and when I did, she'd say,
`You found it!' Acting with her was like playing a tennis match. It
was fun to play with her, and she encouraged that; no matter what
you hit at her, she'd lob it right back. She is an artist to the
core.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald was involved with ``Ragtime'' from the beginning; in
the workshop process she would gloat at all her free time, because
Sarah dies in the first act. But one day the creators called her
in; they had seen the effect she made, and so they had written her
into the second act, where she appears as a spirit.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald says she learned a lot from the two years she spent in
that musical. ``The show didn't call for my soprano range, but I
worked to make sure it was always there. I also learned to protect
my voice. A performer has to lead a monastic life _ although I'm
not saying that I always did. You can't let your body get worn
down; you can't smoke or drink, and I can't do dairy. When you're
offstage, it's a very boring life. I don't even like to talk a lot;
e-mail is wonderful _ it means I don't have to return phone calls.
I still take at least one voice lesson a week, and up to three if I
can. We work on everything from the extension at the top down to
the basement. I try never to stray away from the classical
technique of singing.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald maintains a life outside the theater; she lives quietly
with her significant other, Broadway bassist Peter Donovan, who
plays in her backup ensemble with the Pops. She remains in touch
both with her roots and with newer friends _ after Boston, she was
heading to the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam, Conn., to see
a colleague from ``Ragtime'' tackle an important role in a major
revivial.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald records for Nonesuch, which developed her studio
talents slowly and carefully. She appeared on Dawn Upshaw's Rodgers
&AMP; Hart album, a Bernstein album, in John Adams's ``I was looking at
the ceiling and then I saw the sky,'' which, she says, ``sounds
deceptively simple _ the rhythms make it very hard to learn.'' Her
first solo album, ``Way Back to Paradise,'' made a very big stir
last year. Instead of doing a safe collection of standards and
greatest hits, McDonald chose to introduce the work of five
composer lyricists of her own generation _ Jason Robert Brown,
Jenny Giering, Ricky Ian Gordon, Adam Guettel, and Michael John
LaChiusa; after performances of ``Ragtime'' she performed this same
material in a solo show in New York's Public Theater. Forthcoming
recordings include selections from ``Porgy and Bess'' with Michael
Tilson Thomas and the San Francisco Symphony (BMG), and a complete
recording of Bernstein's ``Wonderful Town'' on EMI, conducted by
Sir Simon Rattle. This month she is recording a Harold Arlen album
for Nonesuch.
</P>
<P>
   Her next big project is a new show called ``Marie Christine,''
which is a retelling of the story of Medea, set in New Orleans;
she'll perform it in Lincoln Center beginning in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to keep keep on doing more of the same kinds of
things, different things,'' McDonald says. ``I don't want to be
confined by anything. Recently I sang Copland's Emily Dickinson
songs, and I loved that; I would like to be in an opera sometime. I
just have to listen to what my voice is telling me to do.''

WE ARE STARDUST AGAIN: LOOKING FORWARD TO WOODSTOCK '99 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME, N.Y. _ Woodstock producer Michael Lang hops into his
souped-up Chevy Impala and races down a runway of the
decommissioned Griffiss Air Force Base to show a visitor the
grounds. Giant B-52s used to roar down this same runway, back when
the Soviets had the nuclear weapons base in their sights during the
Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Lang, a legendary hippie who also co-produced the first two
Woodstock festivals, starts his tour by pointing to a flat, grassy
strip next to the runway. That's where two sprawling, 500-foot-long
stages _ one designed by Peter Max _ are being built for Woodstock
'99, which takes place Friday through Sunday. The stages are
two-thirds of a mile apart and will be separated by a food court,
misting tents, beer gardens, a cyber cafe, a cinema, and a sports
park _ all to be overseen by nearly 12,000 staffers who are trying
to transform a stark military base that closed five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked the irony of bringing a peace-and-love festival to a
place where B-52s used to be stationed,'' said Lang. ``I thought it
was a great metaphor for the end of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   As ponytailed Woodstock archivist Duke Devlin said later, while
parked in front of an airplane hangar that will house all-night
rave dance parties after the live music: ``I think the festival is
going to be a blessing for this real estate. And, really,
Woodstocks can pop up anywhere. This time it popped up at an old
Air Force base.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hoping for profit
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first two Woodstocks lost money, but Lang, 56, hopes to turn
the tide with the new-generation Woodstock '99, aimed at a
cutting-edge demographic. Nearly 200,000 advance tickets have been
sold at $150 each, which includes three 13-hour days of music (by
youth faves such as the Dave Matthews Band, Limp Bizkit, Metallica,
Alanis Morissette, Sheryl Crow, Wyclef Jean, Korn, Fatboy Slim, and
others) and three nights of camping amid scrub pines farther down
the grassy strip.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers anticipate between 250,000 and 300,000 people by the
weekend (the site is a four- to five-hour drive from Boston), and
one shouldn't expect to crash the gates, because there's a military
fence and another fence 12 feet high being built to stretch 3 miles
around the 1,400-acre site (more than five times the size of the
Woodstock '94 site, in Saugerties, N.Y.).
</P>
<P>
   An accompanying pay-per-view broadcast is expected to be seen by
an additional 35 million people, who will pay $59.95 for the three
days, or $34.95 daily. Together with sales from an obligatory
Woodstock '99 album and documentary film, Lang hopes to come out
ahead of the $10 million he has invested.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's this ancillary income that will be the key to whether we
make money. And if we don't make money this time, I may not do this
again. It's just too much work,'' said Lang, who has endured what
he calls ``permit hell'' from local Oneida County officials. (There
was a report earlier this week that the fest might be canceled
because of hassles over board of health permits, but these reports
``are just plain wrong,'' according to a posting on the festival's
Web site, woodstock.com.)
</P>
<P>
   Woodstock also does not have an official sponsor this time. The
'94 fest in Saugerties had PepsiCola, which contributed a reported
$5 million, but that sparked outrage from some critics who felt it
violated the countercultural spirit of the original 1969 Woodstock,
in Bethel, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Lang hopes to mute that criticism by not having an official
sponsor, even though the market would likely be more forgiving
these days. That's because the rock industry has sold out
mercilessly in recent years with high ticket prices, grotesque
sponsorship deals, and a pervasive jadedness. By comparison,
Woodstock '99 looks innocent. The festival's $150 ticket is just
half the cost of a single Rolling Stones show. And Lang plans to
revive hippie generosity by having parts of the new ``Peace Wall''
surrounding the site auctioned off to support the Red Cross's aid
for Kosovo victims.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when you talk to performers, the overriding concern is
not spiritual renewal or the return of hippie idealism, but just
the chance to play for so many people in one setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no downside to doing this,'' said Sheryl Crow, whose
career received a huge boost when she played Woodstock '94. ``I
don't expect this to represent a higher cause or a spiritual
experience. But I'm a performer who has always felt that the more
people I can play for, the better.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it will be the same joyful collection of people
that the original one was, with people all sitting back and getting
to know each other,'' said Dave Matthews. ``There will probably be
a lot more attitudes at this one, a lot more people `running the
show,' a lot more running around with clipboards and cell phones.
But we love to play; that's the principal reason we're doing it.
And there's a lot of great bands there, so it should be a great
show.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Continuing the legend
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like a really cool thing to me,'' said Fred Durst of
Limp Bizkit. ``And, man, we're playing the festival that started
with the legendary Jimi Hendrix! To think that I'm playing that is
a kick. It may have a different meaning now, a different feel. It's
not as special, I don't think, but it's still a gathering that
brings together a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Chuck Garvey, guitarist with moe (one of the
younger bands coming): ``Some people have grumbled that it's not
like the original Woodstock because of bands like Metallica and
Limp Bizkit. But these are bands that the kids want to see.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an honor to be part of it,'' added moe guitarist Al
Schnier. ``It's on a par with the Olympics at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Also headed to Woodstock is Guster, the Boston-based neo-hippie
band whose singer, Ryan Miller, attended Woodstock '94, where he
``slept on a pizza box under a flatbed truck.'' This time, he'll
sleep in Guster's tour bus, but, he said, ``I would be going to
this concert whether I was playing in it or not. Also, we're not
just flying in and out to play the gig. We're going to hang around
and see some of the other acts. We're going to come early and stay
late.''
</P>
<P>
   A damper on the festival was Aerosmith's decision to withdraw,
because of ``scheduling conflicts.'' This was just days after
Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry told this paper, ``We like doing
these sort of festivals. . . . I wish they'd do Woodstock every
year and do it on the East Coast and the West Coast.'' Aerosmith is
currently on a European tour and unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Only two fans, however, requested refunds when Aerosmith pulled
out, according to Woodstock co-promoter John Scher of Metropolitan
Entertainment in Manhattan. ``People come for the event, not just
to see one band,'' Scher said.
</P>

SAN FRANCISCO CELEBRATES ITS `RING' CYCLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The first staging of Wagner's complete ``Ring''
cycle was in 1876. More than a century later, this tetralogy of
operas remains the largest challenge in the repertory of Western
musical theater.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is the most difficult and expensive work to produce,
it is also the most prestigious. Only a few American cities
regularly experience the ``Ring,'' and San Francisco is one of
them. The San Francisco Opera mounted its first ``Ring'' in 1935,
the company's 12th season, and there were performances of the
complete cycle in 1972, 1985, and 1990. This summer there were four
cycles, 16 performances, between June 9 and July 3, and more than
50,000 people came to see them.
</P>
<P>
   The effort came in for a lot of bad press, some of it deserved.
But the fourth cycle was an honorable achievement that enlarged the
communal experience of the audience that attended and applauded it.
Wagner saw to that, but the cycle was also well-conducted and often
well-sung, and some of the stage effects were spectacular. The
problems lay in the erratic orchestral playing and singing, and in
a jumbled, jerry-built artistic plan that brought in a prominent
stage director to create a new production within the principal
scenic elements of the old one.
</P>
<P>
   Director Andrei Serban has created some of the great theatrical
experiences of the last 20 years, but this ``Ring'' was not one of
them. A director of the ``Ring'' faces three tasks: He must solve
some of the most challenging staging problems ever posed; he must
invest the characters with divinity, humanity, emotional and
intellectual complexity; and he must engage some of the issues
Wagner raised _ even some issues the works raise that Wagner might
not have intended to.
</P>
<P>
   Serban and his associates managed pretty well with the element
of spectacle, though the Rainbow Bridge in ``Das Rheingold'' was
about as subtle as a bubblegum wrapper, and the magic fire in ``Die
Walkuere'' wasn't much more than a ton of dry ice in a red-light
district. There wasn't much sense of the omnipresent river Rhine,
and the Rhinemaidens looked like spangled chorines in a Vegas
production of ``The Rocky Horror Picture Show.'' On the other hand,
there was a fine pair of giants _ the singers were concealed inside
15-foot puppets _ and a pretty good dragon for Siegfried to slay.
The final flood, conflagration, and collapse of Valhalla was almost
as good as a movie or an Andrew Lloyd Webber show _ it took the
coordinated efforts of 60 stagehands to make the last three minutes
of the cycle happen.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately there was no consistent standard of
characterization, and little looked as meticulously rehearsed as
the last three minutes of the 14-hour work. Singers who can act,
did _ Tom Fox and Gary Rideout (outstanding in vocalism and
characterization as Alberich and Mime), Alan Held (Gunther),
Reinhard Hagen (Hunding), Wolfgang Schmidt (Siegmund), James Morris
(Wotan), and, well ahead of all the others, Marjana Lipovsek
(Fricka and Waltraute). No one stopped those who wanted to go
overboard (George Gray as Siegfried, Eric Halfvarson as Hagen,
Kristine Ciesinski as Gutrune, and the vamping Rhinemaidens). The
others stood, waited, and sang. Jane Eaglen prepared for
Brunnhilde's heartfelt plea to Wotan by retreating behind a rock
all the way across the stage in order to have a sip of water.
</P>
<P>
   Serban barely managed to get the story told and didn't attempt
issues. He forthrightly admitted he really didn't know the
``Ring,'' its music, and the language of the text _ this production
was on a surtitle level of intellectual sophistication. Serban did
manage to achieve familiarity with the video of Patrice Chereau's
famous Bayreuth production of the '70s, and adopted several of its
less persuasive details: At the end of act one of ``Die Walkuere''
Siegmund and Sieglinde leapt toward Heldensex on top of Hunding's
dining room table. At the very best, this was no more than a
notebook of jottings for some future staging of the ``Ring.''
</P>
<P>
   The overall look remains good; John Coyne revised and simplified
the original designs by John Conklin, which ranged in inspiration
from German romantic painting to Brancusi and Maxfield Parrish.
Looking at it was like paging through a glossy design magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The Scottish conductor Donald Runnicles, for the last seven
years music director of San Francisco Opera, has conducted the
``Ring'' in Vienna. His reading was swift, fluid, and
conversational, without the traditional emphasis on weight and
portent _ a tradition modern conductors imitate at their own peril.
Runnicles's approach succeeded because it was musical, intelligent,
and internally coherent, but he had his work cut out for him. Even
by the fourth ``Die Rheingold'' solo players were making
conspicuous wrong entrances and the woodwind choir was not even
trying to stay in tune; brass entrances were often unbalanced and
uncoordinated. The orchestra, fatigued from too much rehearsal and
performance, may be better than it let itself sound; this was
provincial playing.
</P>
<P>
   There were a couple of familiar performances _ Morris's Wotan is
still commandingly sonorous, Lipovsek's Fricka and Waltraute are
full of vividly personal response to text, and she knows how to
listen and respond. Deborah Voigt was lustrously loud as Sieglinde;
she doesn't go in for dynamic variety and nuance, but no one
carried along in the flood tide seemed to care. Eaglen has become
today's Brunnhilde of choice, and she sings with precisely those
qualities one missed in Voigt, but without the flood tide _ she is
always measuring herself out. There was nevertheless majesty in her
singing, and sometimes a luminous sensitivity and simplicity. At
the end of a hard month of singing, she did sound a little tired,
patchy in the lower middle register, and there was many a sweeping
turn upstage for a clearing of the throat audible in Row J. Voigt
has found much of the weight she lost last year, but she is
confident in herself and therefore looks radiant; Eaglen looks
uncomfortable most of the time _ Wotan spread his cloak to conceal
her descent onto her rocky bed _ and as an actress she communicated
little more than a coltish eagerness to please. She did display
presence of mind when an emotional grapple with her Valkyrie sister
dislodged the critical Ring from her finger and sent it rolling
across the stage; fortunately Alberich wasn't around, and Eaglen
lost no time in chasing it down and triumphantly restoring it to
her finger.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfgang Schmidt, Siegfried in the earlier cycles, took on
Siegmund in the fourth cycle, singing with plangent tone and
meaningful diction before conking out of the later operas in favor
of George Gray, a tenor who figured in the early history of the
Boston Lyric Opera. Gray is a likable performer who played the
young Siegfried for laughs and rose to eloquence in his death
scene. He roughs up his strong lyric tenor in order to simulate a
real Heldentenor voice, however, so too often he sounds more like
Satchmo than like Siegfried; when he stays inside his limits, he
can sing.
</P>
<P>
   For a visitor from a city whose support for opera has been
ambivalent for more than a century, it was impressive to see how
San Francisco lined up its resources behind the ``Ring.'' There
were lectures, a special Web site, concurrent exhibits, an air of
civic festivity. Even the public-transit system extended its hours
to accommodate the public; San Francisco loves its opera, and
Wagner could take all the time he wanted to.

DIVERS BATTLE OVER RIGHT TO SHIPWRECK

<P>
   NANTUCKET, Mass. _ The rumor surfaced soon after the luxury
liner RMS Republic sank in the icy waters off Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   There was gold on that ship, one story goes _ a cache of
American Gold Eagle coins hidden in the ship's hold, a secret loan
from the French government to bolster Russia's last czar as his
country turned to revolt.
</P>
<P>
   Now, nearly a century later, the rights to the wreck of the
Republic _ and a share of the $1.6 billion in gold rumored to lie
with it _ have sparked a war between two would-be salvors.
</P>
<P>
   On one side there is Martin Bayerle, a convicted felon and
boisterous big-talking entrepreneur who touts the Russian
connection as his own trademarked ``Third Theory.'' On the other is
William Cleary, a personal injury lawyer from Hackensack, N.J., who
calls Bayerle's theory far-fetched and calls Bayerle the ``ocean
equivalent of a strip miner.''
</P>
<P>
   The two divers are locking horns in federal court over the
rights to salvage a wreck that may or may not contain gold.
Bayerle, who located the Republic in 1981, claims the ship as his
to salvage. Cleary, who recovered a porthole from a dive there last
summer, asserts that Bayerle lost his rights because he hasn't
maintained the ship or conducted a dive there in years.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins in court will still have to contend with powerful
forces of nature. The crumpled Republic, which rests near the Mount
Everest of dives, the wreck of the Andrea Doria, lies under 270
crushing feet of water. Because of the depth, divers must spend
protracted periods of time returning to the surface to prevent
``the bends,'' the formation of potentially fatal gas bubbles in
the blood.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republic has the added lure of sunken treasure _ a
vaguely circulated legend since it sank in 1909.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe anyone has been able to bring up any of the
so-called treasure,'' said Paul C. Morris, a marine historian and
author on Nantucket. ``The trouble of that is, if anybody does,
they're going to lie about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The twisted tale of international intrigue that preoccupies
Bayerle began in 1909, when the 585-foot, 15,378-ton RMS Republic
made its way through murky fog off Nantucket and was struck by a
passing Italian liner, the SS Florida. The sinking Republic became
known for its distress call _ a precursor to the ``SOS'' that
brought the first successful lifesaving effort to a sinking ship,
according to published accounts provided by the Nantucket
Historical Association. But its fame was eclipsed by a sister ship
_ the Titanic, also owned by White Star Lines _ which suffered a
better-known fate three years later.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Bayerle said, published documents put the wreck of
the Republic at incorrect coordinates, about 7 miles from the
actual site. (He explains this as a government coverup bent on
protecting the sunken gold.) The former Martha's Vineyard dive shop
owner located the wreck in 1981 and, after years of extensive
research and travel expeditions, concocted his own complicated
theories about the presence of treasure on the Republic.
</P>
<P>
   His research showed that the French government bought $3 million
in gold in 1909 _ a loan, he believes, to help Russia's Czar
Nicholas fight the Bolsheviks. There is no record of those coins
reaching a destination, so Bayerle believes they were on the
Republic, lost to the bottom of the sea and political sensitivities
that made revelations of the secret donation impossible.
</P>
<P>
   For his novel ``Third Theory,'' he uses a TM trademark for each
citation on his Web site, which is devoted to ruminations on the
Republic. In the 1980s, the concept proved so persuasive that
Bayerle _ and his ``Far Fetched Salvage Company'' _ was able to
raise almost $3 million from investors for his gold-digging
expedition to the wreck.
</P>
<P>
   The crew he assembled aboard the Wahoo staged a highly
publicized, 72-day, around-the-clock dive in search of gold. But
despite Bayerle's research and unvarnished optimism, the expedition
yielded little but 5,000 bottles of tainted wine, rendering Bayerle
something of an island eccentric.
</P>
<P>
   Love soon drew Bayerle away from Martha's Vineyard. He married a
woman in West Virginia, where life eventually took another strange
turn: His wife took a lover, whom he shot to death, Bayerle said.
</P>
<P>
   He spent more than two years in a West Virginia prison for
voluntary manslaughter; he calls the man a psychopath who was
hoarding sexually explicit audiotapes of conversations with
Bayerle's wife and suggestive photos of her daughter. Bayerle, now
48, contends he acted only to protect his family when he found the
man practicing with a shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why, needless to say, I'm getting on with my life _ and
he's not,'' Bayerle said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An invaluable window
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While Bayerle was gone, Cleary edged onto his watery turf off
Nantucket. The 38-year-old lawyer began diving the Republic for
sheer adventure, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The treasure is not what has attracted me to the Republic or
White Star either,'' he said. ``It is, and has always been,
exploring.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Cleary and his crew unearthed a porthole which gave
him an invaluable window to the wreck: With that artifact, the US
District Court in Newark ordered Cleary to ``arrest'' the wreck _
meaning he's the salvor in possession and has, at minimum, the
right to be compensated for anything he recovers. Bayerle lost that
right by not salvaging anything there for 10 years, said Peter
Hess, Cleary's attorney and a fellow diver.
</P>
<P>
   Bayerle is disdainful of his rival's actions. ``Now a recreation
technical diver who can dive down and recover a porthole and a few
shards of china wants to use that to cloak himself as a `salvor,'
'' he said by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Cleary recently hauled Bayerle into a New Jersey court to
legally prevent him from salvaging the wreck; he had spied
Bayerle's Internet postings revealing another planned expedition.
But Cleary failed to win an injunction against Bayerle, largely
because the coordinates Cleary listed for the ship were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't even get the location of the wreck correct,'' said
Bayerle, who peppers his comments about Cleary with name-calling:
Interloper. Claim-jumper.
</P>
<P>
   Hess, Cleary's attorney, said he plans to correct the
coordinates and return to court. In the meantime, Cleary plans
another dive this weekend to attach to the ship the ``arrest
papers'' that affirm his legal claim. And Bayerle's lawyer hints
that his client will be going back on the offensive to reclaim the
wreck using his correct coordinates in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that he's not going to let Mr. Cleary interfere with
his salvage rights and his plans,'' said attorney Tim Barrow. ``I'm
sure you haven't heard the last of this, by any means.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Uncertain treasure
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But neither salvor has maintained the site, noted ship captain
Steve Bielenda, who suggests that neither man has proper claim.
Bielenda manned the Wahoo with Bayerle in 1987, and then turned
around to help Cleary with locating the wreck after Bayerle sued
him for breach of contract. ``I'm still bitter,'' he admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Cleary claims he's not even convinced there is gold aboard and
says he wouldn't solicit funds for such an extensive expedition
without firmer evidence _ gleaned either by diving or by uncovering
hard historic data that he says Bayerle lacks. ``He uses all
negative inferences that the gold is there,'' Cleary said.
</P>
<P>
   Bayerle points to his elaborate research of import-export
documents showing a $3 million loss in January 1909. What makes him
so sure it was on the Republic?
</P>
<P>
   ``There is evidence,'' Bayerle said, though he admits it is
circumstantial. ``That's why we're looking for the smoking gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, considering his past, he releases a big belly laugh.
``Though that's probably not a term I should use.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleary alleges that Bayerle is careless with precious artifacts
in his pursuit of gold and pledges to restore and display any
artifacts he finds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to shift the public's perception from that type of
salvor to the type of salvor I see myself as _ someone interested
in the exploration of these beautiful shipwrecks,'' Cleary said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he keeps the names of those who contact him about
future investment in a gold-diving expedition.
</P>
<P>
   Just in case.

VOTE AN ENDING THAT MAY ONLY INVITE RESEGREGATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; News reports last week of the Boston School Committee's vote
to end Boston's desegregation effort ricocheted across radio,
television, and the Internet as if another war had finally ended.
</P>
<P>
   There were uplifting news reports of how people on opposite
sides of the 1974 court-ordered desegregation plan today stood
together in support of the School Committee vote to end the
desegregation policy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as laudable as it may appear, the committee's 5-to-2 vote
to accept School Superintendent Thomas Payzant's recommendation to
end the city's modified school desegregation policy known as
``controlled choice'' is a dangerous decision. It dismantles an
effort to actively promote racial fairness.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, the committee's vote was not a happy ending to the
Boston busing story. Rather, the vote appears to be a calculated
move to return racial segregation to the city's schools. And the
result of this regression could once again place Boston under the
rule and thumb of the US federal courts, as it did 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The School Committee's majority and Payzant referred to a
recently filed federal lawsuit filed by white parents who claim
their children were denied their choice of schools because of their
race. School officials argue that the lawsuit is likely to prevail
and thus it was better to end _ not defend _ the city's policy of
making race a factor in school assignments.
</P>
<P>
   But the city's decision to end this system _ which managed to
give 85 percent of the students their first or second choice of
schools each year, while still nurturing a racial balance _ is as
much without merit as the lawsuit itself.
</P>
<P>
   A detailed analysis of the lawsuit by the two creators of the
``controlled choice'' plan, Charles Willie, professor emeritus at
Harvard, and Michael Alves, a senior planner at Brown University,
is very revealing.
</P>
<P>
   Their analysis shows that the plan was fair to all racial groups
enrolled in the school, even though the school population is now 15
percent white and 85 percent black and other minorities.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one student whose parents brought the suit said
that he was excluded from his first- and second-choice schools
because of being white. His parents, he said, sought to classify
him as a Native American solely for the purpose of obtaining a
chosen school assignment.
</P>
<P>
   As the analysis reported, changing a racial classification for
this purpose is ``suspect since the `controlled choice' plan does
not give preferential treatment in assignment to any racial
group.''
</P>
<P>
   A second plaintiff, also white, claimed he was exluded from the
first and second schools of his choice because of his race.
According to the analysis by Willie and Alves, this may have
happened, but it's relatively rare; only 9.6 percent of the 15,602
students who were assigned to the 1999-2000 school year did not
receive their first or second choice, they found. Specifically, of
the 15,000 students overall, only 106 whites, 796 blacks and 609
students from other racial and ethnic groups did not receive their
first or second choice. And this small percentage is consistent
with students in all racial groups.
</P>
<P>
   This means that 78.9 percent of all students were assigned to
the school of their first choice, including 84.2 percent of whites,
75.9 percent of blacks, and 80 percent of students from other
racial and ethnic groups. Overall, 91.4 percent of all the students
who applied under ``controlled choice'' were assigned to one of
their top three school choices for this academic year. ``These
results, which are consistent with prior years, do not indicate or
even suggest that students have been intentionally denied their
first- or second-choice school due to their race and the
application of the `controlled choice' student assignment policy,''
Willie and Alves concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The data further shows, they added, that not only do most of the
students in all racial groups receive their first choice, but
``that whites are more likely to receive their first choice than
students from other racial and ethnic groups.''
</P>
<P>
   The parents of the third plaintiff argued that he was not
assigned to any of his six choices of schools for the 1999-2000
year for kindergarten because of his race. But the complaint failed
to ``identify the rank-ordered school choices that were made by the
plaintiff's parents,'' making the charge hard to evaluate.
</P>
<P>
   But for the record, the analysis points out that for
kindergarten, 80.4 percent of whites, 73.2 percent of blacks, and
86.1 percent of other racial and ethnic groups received their first
school choice. The fourth plaintiff's claim is also strongly
refuted by Willie and Alves's analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan voted out by the School Committee, the analysis
concluded that ``there is no evidence that any group has been
intentionally discriminated against because of its race during the
10 years that `controlled choice' has been operational in the
city's school system.''
</P>
<P>
   The `controlled choice' policy did pinpoint the city's best and
worst schools. The best are consistently ``overchosen,'' and as a
result there are not enough seats to accommodate all the
applicants. This problem could be fixed if the School Committee
implemented the school improvement components of the plan as it
promised in 1989, making more schools more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Boston School Committee has decided to drop the
``controlled choice'' plan and distribute students on the basis of
neighborhood proximity. This could easily result in at least
several one-race schools, white or black, ``that would likely
violate the US District Court's permanent injunction against
intentional resegregation'' in the Boston school system, according
to Willie and Alves. They should know; both worked closely over the
years with US District Judge Arthur Garrity Jr., who issued and
oversaw the federal court order to desegregate the city's schools.
</P>
<P>
   For whatever reason, the School Committee, Payzant, and Mayor
Thomas M. Menino are willing to replace a plan that assures
compliance with the federal court order and replace it with one
that could resegregate the schools, bring back federal control to
the system, and set Boston back more than 20 years.

THE END OF `ONE CHINA' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There has been no end of heavy weather these last few days over
the ``One China'' formula that Lee Teng-hui, Taiwan's president, is
supposed to have betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   In its usual thuggish style, the Communist government in Beijing
erupted in threats and abuse. It warned that ``any plot to
challenge the `One-China' principle . . . will fail,'' described
Lee as ``a criminal of the nation who will leave a stink for a
thousand years,'' and bluntly warned that China now has the
technology to build a neutron bomb. At the State Department, James
Rubin was more diplomatic, though equally disapproving. ``It is not
helpful,'' he lectured, ``for the Taiwanese authorities to make
statements that make it harder to have dialogue.'' His colleague
James Foley stressed that US policy ``is unchanged: Our `One China'
policy is longstanding and certainly well known.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, ``One China'' is not a policy at all. It is a
falsehood, one to which the United States has genuflected for 50
years to accommodate dictators and strongmen. It is time to stand
up to the dictators and start speaking the truth.
</P>
<P>
   From 1949 _ the year of Mao's Communist victory in China _ until
1979 _ when Jimmy Carter extended diplomatic recognition to Beijing
_ American foreign policy pretended that the rightful government of
China was in Taipei. This fiction appealed to Taiwan's former
authoritarian rulers, who periodically blustered about reconquering
the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1979, the United States has pretended the opposite: that
the government in Beijing is somehow the government of Taiwan. This
fiction appeals to the totalitarians who run the People's Republic
of China, who insist that Taiwan is merely a ``renegade'' province.
</P>
<P>
   As long as Beijing and Taipei both claimed to be the sole
legitimate government of China, there was a case to be made for
winking and going along with ``One China.'' But going along with
the pretense that Taiwan was part of China did not mean the United
States agreed with it. ``The government of the United States of
America,'' declared the Recognition Communique signed by Jimmy
Carter in 1978, ``acknowledges the Chinese position that there is
but one China and Taiwan is part of China.'' Note: the Chinese
position, not the American position.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that during his trip to China last year, President
Clinton endorsed Beijing's hard line. ``Our Taiwan policy,'' he
said, ``is that we don't support independence for Taiwan or `two
Chinas' or `one Taiwan, one China.' '' But his words were promptly
rejected by Congress, which repudiated them by nearly unanimous
votes in both houses.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, presidential assertions and summit communiques do
not have the force of law. The Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, Public
Law 96-8, does. That statute makes it a matter of US policy ``to
preserve and promote extensive, close, and friendly commercial,
cultural, and other relations'' between the United States and
Taiwan. And it specifies that the United States will consider ``any
effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful
means, including by boycotts or embargoes, a threat to the peace
and security of the Western Pacific area and of grave concern to
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, close US-Taiwan relations are mandated by law, and
Taiwan's welfare is an explicit focus of American concern. When the
statute was passed, Taiwan was still a police state. Today, it is a
free and robust democracy. More than ever, Taiwan deserves our
friendship, protection, and admiration.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Teng-hui's words last week were a simple statement of
reality. Inasmuch as China and Taiwan are separate, sovereign
countries, he said in a radio interview, they should be dealing
with each other on a ``state-to-state'' basis. This was neither a
declaration of independence nor a rejection of reunification as an
ultimate goal. It was a statesmanlike call for mutual acceptance _
and an announcement that the tired fable of ``One China'' has lost
its diplomatic usefulness.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign policy works best when it is grounded in reality. Fifty
years after Mao's victory on the mainland and Chiang Kai-shek's
flight to Taiwan, there is one China and one Taiwan. The former is
a Communist dungeon, ruled by a junta that enslaves prisoners,
persecutes Christians, arms vicious terror-states, forcibly
sterilizes women, and sends people to prison for talking about
freedom. The latter is a democracy, a prosperous island of free
markets, free speech, and free elections.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan is something new in the 4,000-year history of the Chinese
people: a land of liberty, where human rights are respected and
governments rule at the pleasure of the governed. Its population is
but a fraction of China's _ though at 22 million, Taiwan has more
people than Australia and New Zealand combined _ but in that
fraction is the hope of what China might one day become.
</P>
<P>
   The United States behaves toward the Taiwanese with a shameful
injustice. We blackball them at the United Nations and deny them
normal diplomatic courtesies. We tiptoe around Taiwanese autonomy
as if it were a dangerous explosive, but treat the brutal regime in
Beijing with deference and respect.
</P>
<P>
   On one side of the Taiwan Strait lies one of our most reliable
democratic allies. On the other lies a violent, untrustworthy foe.
It's time we started treating our friend as a friend. Junking ``One
China'' would make an excellent start.

A DIZZYING DESCENT FROM THE HUB OF THE UNIVERSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- As the feel-good flutter of hosting the All-Star Game
fades, what's left is the uneasy reality: It's been a summer of
discontent for the traditional heavy hitters in the Olde Towne's
institutional lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Providence's Fleet Bank, having gobbled up Bank of New England
and Shawmut as hors d'oeuvre, is now busy digesting BankBoston,
over the protest of activists who worry that community lending and
commitment may be swallowed up as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of Fine Arts is reeling from its Oxford-educated
director Malcolm Rogers's purge of longtime curators last month.
</P>
<P>
   After 25 years, Seiji Ozawa has told the Boston Symphony
Orchestra he will pass the baton and leave Boston for Vienna, a
city that gazes even more resolutely backward into the past.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, The New York Times toppled Globe publisher Benjamin
B. Taylor and installed Richard H. Gilman, a Times senior vice
president, in his place, thus ending 126 years of Taylors atop the
masthead.
</P>
<P>
   And more change may be imminent at yet another local
institution. After several rocky years, WGBH-TV is now under such
sharp fire for sharing its contributor lists with the Democratic
Party that some wonder if heads may roll.
</P>
<P>
   There's little doubt about it: In the Hub of the Universe, the
century is ending with a big institutional bang, bringing
speed-of-light change and controversy to a city accustomed to a
more measured pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The events that are occurring in town are of consequence,''
says former Mayor H. Kevin White. ``People are saying, there's an
awful lot of change, what does it all portend?''
</P>
<P>
   Concrete answers are difficult, but expect stark new demands on
organizations accustomed to incremental evolution. And, in some
cases, a decidedly Boston way of doing business will give way to
less sentimental, idiosyncratic, or community-oriented concerns. At
a minimum, the changes making headlines in the last few weeks have
added to a sense of uncertainty about Boston's identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pessimistic point of view is obvious: There's a feeling
that we are going down the tubes,'' said Boston College historian
Thomas O'Connor, author of eight books about Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The changes of recent weeks resonate all too easily with our
erosion in another arena. Time was, it was pleasing and plausible
to think of Massachusetts political leaders as potential presidents
or Cabinet stock. And from Christian Herter to John Kennedy to John
Volpe to Michael Dukakis, the notion didn't seem so very
far-fetched.
</P>
<P>
   But these days? Well, in 1997, former governor William Weld came
back upon his shield in his attempt to become Mexican ambassador.
And Senator John F. Kerry decided he couldn't contest Vice
President Al Gore, the plodding front-runner in 2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Among the recent changes, only Ozawa's planned departure from
the Boston Symphony Orchestra has been seen as a largely positive
opportunity. Ozawa has long been a Boston icon, but after a quarter
century of his coolly technical conducting and distant personal
style, the BSO seems both stale and remote, leaving a clear desire
for a maestro both more emotionally adventurous and civically
inclined.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet's takeover of BankBoston, in contrast, has touched off a
raging debate about the demise of an important Boston institution
and the merits of big vs. small.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am always concerned about large institutions that get bigger
and bigger, which means that competition, by necessity gets less
and less,'' said Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   Community activists share those worries, fretting that when a
new superbank emerges from the synthesis of Fleet and BankBoston,
it will be less a concerned community citizen of Boston than a
bottom-line-driven behemoth.
</P>
<P>
   The restructuring at the MFA, which meant the dismissal of 18
staffers in the most radical revamping in the museum's 129-year
history, signals a dramatic centralization of control and a loss of
power for individual curators. That, Rogers has said, is a way of
breaking down internal walls and fostering teamwork in pursuit of a
``one museum'' philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some critics wonder if that's really desirable at an
institution that already seems more interested in blockbuster
exhibits of artists whose fame assures ticket-office success than
in a more eclectic program that might acquaint Boston with painters
who aren't already household names.
</P>
<P>
   Some prominent Bostonians have seen the New York Times' naming
of a new Globe publisher as further eroding Boston's sense of
identity. That's the view that Chris Lydon _ host of WBUR-FM's
``The Connection,'' one of talk radio's smartest shows _ sent
across the airwaves last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're doing is rubbing our nose in the fact that Boston
is a franchise town now, as most American cities are,'' Lydon, who
has written for both the Globe and the Times, lamented. ``It's not
exactly news, but still it hurts that we don't own a lot of our own
village conversation anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   A tricky tension between diplomacy and candor always looms when
writing about one's own institution. The official word at the Globe
is that the sudden change of publishers doesn't signal more
dramatic change to come. The New York Times bought the Globe more
than six years ago, after all, so out-of-town ownership is hardly
new. Gilman, meanwhile, has promised that the Globe will have
complete editorial autonomy from the Times. And two editors who
have deep local roots _ Matthew V. Storin in the newsroom and
H.D.S. Greenway on the editorial page _ are still the ones shaping
the paper, day to day.
</P>
<P>
   But the appointment of a Times manager to the top spot in Boston
marks both a dramatic shift in leadership and a consolidation of
control by New York. That's why many at the paper expect other
significant changes will likely follow.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just the Globe that's owned elsewhere, of course.
Channel 5 is owned by Hearst-Argyle, based in New York; Channel 4
belongs to New York-based CBS; Channel 7 is a part of Sunbeam
Television of Miami. Tribune Broadcasting of Chicago owns Channel
56, while Channel 25 is owned by Fox, also based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that fretting about out-of-town ownership in an
era of global capitalism is like railing at the tides. ``It is
often hard to know who owns what these days, and it is often beside
the point,'' says former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich, now a
professor of social and economic policy at Brandeis University.
</P>
<P>
   Further, despite the immediate institutional trauma,
organizational shakeups are often healthy, Reich contends.
</P>
<P>
   ``You worry more when everything is ossified . . . when the same
old guard stays exactly where it was, because it is in those
situations an institution can lose touch and stop innovating,'' he
argues.
</P>
<P>
   And if none of the institutions in question seemed exactly
static, each clearly has its problems: circulation and classified
ad loss at the Globe, a lack of excitement and connection at the
symphony, an old-boy arrogance and insularity at BankBoston, a
feeling of disjointedness at the MFA.
</P>
<P>
   Still, how one reacts to the recent changes ultimately probably
depends on how he or she defines Boston. The Hub is a city in love
with its history, and that mindset has helped make Boston an
interesting place to live or visit. But one consequence is that
Boston tends to see itself not as it is, but as an after-image of
what it has been.
</P>
<P>
   There's a certain myopia in such a backward glance. When
aspiring author V.S. Naipaul arrived in England from Trinidad in
1950, he came at a time when postwar forces had transformed London
into one of the world's great international cities, awash with
different peoples and cultures.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, as he writes in ``The Enigma of Arrival,'' his
perspective was so colored by expectations drawn from his schoolboy
reading he couldn't see the city for what it was. All he could see
was Dickens's London.
</P>
<P>
   Boston suffers the same problem. Its informal curators too often
present it not as it is, but as its historical self, a city full of
Irish politicians, Brahmin institutions, and clannish ethnic
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   But that's really not the Boston of 1999. Ride the T, walk the
neighborhoods, attend a Chamber of Commerce meeting, and one
quickly sees how much that Boston has receded into the past.
</P>
<P>
   The question, says Ralph Whitehead, professor of journalism at
the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, is ``whether the new
Boston is as important on the new terrain as the old Boston was on
the old terrain.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer isn't clear yet, but there are certainly signs of
growth and reinvention. If some of the pillars the support the City
Above seem to be quaking, at the grass roots Boston is being
transformed.
</P>
<P>
   Take the world of information technology. There are now 1,700
software or Internet firms in the Greater Boston area, 2,750 in
Massachusetts. It's a City Inside, a thousand pixels of light,
small companies transforming the Boston area economy, IT workers
remaking neighborhoods, establishing favorites bars and bistros,
setting down roots, pushing Boston into the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the perceptions that the industry is battling is that
technology is dead in Boston, but nothing could be further from the
truth,'' said Allen Davis, president of softwarejobs.com., a
software-personnel firm. ``This is the Boston of the new economy
and it is growing out of the ashes of the old technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is one piece of evidence for O'Connor's thesis: Different
doesn't mean diminished. The Boston College historian draws a
parallel to the period from 1800 to 1815.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Jefferson, a slave-owning Southerner, had beaten
Massachusetts' own John Adams for president. Blockade and embargo
had crippled the seagoing commerce on which Bostondepended.
Unitarianism was supplanting the strict Congregationalism that had
superintended the city's morals.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with those challenges, Boston quickly reinvented itself as
a more democratic place, with a milder, more forgiving God, and an
entirely new economy based on textiles, manufacturing, banking,
investing, and railroads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within 10 or 15 years, Bostonians began to adapt and a whole
new Boston emerged,'' O'Connor says. ``So if you take the
optimistic view, we may be in that kind of transition now.''

WHAT MADE THE TAYLORS SOMETHING SPECIAL IN AMERICAN JOURNALISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JACK THOMAS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the demise of the Taylor family as publishers of The Boston
Globe after 126 &UR;  &LR; years, it's been moribund here at Morrissey
Boulevard the past week, and if our Yankee brothers will forgive an
ethnic reference, it reminds me of an Irish wake, where the loss
has been softened by the telling of affectionate stories that help
explain, in this case, what made the Taylor family one of the great
dynasties in American publishing.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, newcomers to the Globe were advised that the
Taylors were generous publishers who wanted their reporters to
travel the way they did. On assignment, therefore, we were
delighted to fly first class and register at the best hotels.
</P>
<P>
   One night in Washington, Marty Nolan of the Washington Bureau
boarded a plane for Boston. Stretched out in first class before
takeoff, he was sipping a complimentary drink when who should board
the plane but the publisher, William Davis Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, Marty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, Mr. Taylor,'' said Nolan, who was stunned to see the
publisher wend his way through first class and into tourist.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan still recalls the flight as the longest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the waning days of the Eisenhower administration, the Globe's
Washington correspondent, Bob Healy, lured Senator John F. Kennedy
to a hip new restaurant, Paul Young's. As Kennedy's prestige grew,
so did the line of young Democrats waiting to get into Young's, and
so, too, did the American Express bills sent to Boston by Healy,
who was bold in writing news accounts, but bolder still in writing
expense accounts.
</P>
<P>
   When Kennedy became president, arrangements were made for Davis
Taylor to visit the White House. Healy called Young to say he'd be
stopping by with his publisher, that he wanted a good table and he
did not want to wait in line, not for two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Upon arrival, Taylor and Healy were escorted past a long line.
At the door, Young bowed and led them to his best table. Waiters
were solicitous. Food was prepared to specification, and Young sent
over a bottle of exquisite wine.
</P>
<P>
   Davis Taylor was not fooled.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' he said to Healy, midway through dinner, ``I bet
I've already paid plenty for this meal.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While John I. Taylor was president of the Globe, he returned
from lunch and upon entering the building, he was confronted by a
spectacle that would have infuriated most chief executives.
</P>
<P>
   There, in the bustling lobby, was one of the Globe's senior
reporters, who had consumed too many drinks at lunch and now,
obviously drunk, was ranting, waving his arms, and otherwise making
an ass of himself.
</P>
<P>
   John I. Taylor sprang into action.
</P>
<P>
   Walking directly to the security guard at the reception desk,
John I. took the pipe out of his mouth and pointed to the drunken
reporter. ``Listen,'' said the president of the company, ``we
should probably get him out of here before somebody sees him.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Former editor Tom Winship recalls the fortitude of the Taylors
in behalf of civil rights in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the big decisions was to end a policy dating to the
McKinley administration and to oppose Louise Day Hicks for mayor
because of anti-black policies. It was one of Dave Taylor's many
acts of courage that he never interfered with our coverage of
desegregation. He was nervous, but never tried to slow us down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then there was the march in Selma, Ala., in 1965, one of the
most dramatic events of the civil rights movement. We sent Ed
McGrath to cover it, and unbeknownst to us and unbeknownst even to
his wife, Davis Taylor snuck down to Selma by himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``When McGrath called in with his story, he said, `Guess who's
here in Selma marching? Davis Taylor!'
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it knocked our socks off. We asked him why, and he said,
`I just wanted to see it with my own eyes.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And finally, this is meant to put to rest the notion that the
Taylors have no sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon a few years ago, when Bill Taylor was chairman of
the board, he and I were having a private lunch in a reception room
adjacent to his office. Nothing fancy, sandwiches from the
cafeteria and coffee in paper cups. Having taken care of business,
we traded favorite stories about the newspaper business. His
related to business, mine to news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you were here in 1963,'' he said, ``when my father made
me treasurer of the Globe.''
</P>
<P>
   I looked at him sharply. The remark seemed to acknowledge the
nepotism for which the family has been tweaked for more than a
century. The irony was not lost on Bill Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   He smiled and said, ``I was always good at arithmetic.''

CALLING CARD CAN SAVE YOU LONG-DISTANCE COSTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA WEN AND BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Glenn Barry and the hundreds of thousands of people like him
across the United States, it may be time to cut the cord to their
long-distance phone company.
</P>
<P>
   Barry is one of those people who don't make many long-distance
calls. He says he averages about one a month, and some months none
at all. Yet his long-distance bill with AT&AMP;T is going up, not down.
</P>
<P>
   Even when he makes no long-distance calls during a month, he has
to pay a 93-cent universal service fund fee, an 85-cent
presubscribed interexchange carrier charge, and a $3 minimum
payment charge. He ends up paying $4.78, plus taxes, for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Phone companies say they have imposed the minimum monthly fees
to offset the cost of maintaining low-volume accounts, but Barry
says AT&AMP;T has told him his usage is so low that it plans to bill
him only every third month.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're sending me fewer bills and charging me more,'' the
Canton, Mass. resident said. ``I don't like the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not alone. With MCIWorldCom and Sprint imposing
similar-size fees and even higher $5 minimum monthly charges on
many of their calling plans, the relentless rise of long-distance
fees has become the most persistent consumer complaint we hear.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Madden of Boston says he can't believe the federal
government has the audacity to assess a tax on the universal
service fund fees it collects. ``In my mind it's a tax on a tax,''
he said. ``It's outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   What to do? You could sit tight and see if the Federal
Communications Commission does anything about the minimum monthly
charges; the agency recently launched an investigation. You could
transfer to another long-distance carrier that doesn't impose the
charges. Or you could dump your long-distance carrier and find a
way around the monthly fees and minimums.
</P>
<P>
   Dumping your long-distance carrier will take some careful
planning and may involve a bit of work, but it should save you some
money and in the process send a message to AT&AMP;T, MCIWorldCom and
Sprint. As Barry said, ``If enough people do it, maybe they'll take
note and reverse themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   To get rid of your long-distance carrier, you have to call Bell
Atlantic and desubscribe. Bell Atlantic will charge you a one-time
fee of $5 as well as a $1.04 monthly interexchange carrier charge.
</P>
<P>
   Now you need to find a way to make long-distance calls without a
long-distance carrier. We've written in the past about 10-10
dial-around companies and phone-to-phone calls over the Internet
using AT&AMP;T or IDT Corp. of Hackensack, N.J. There is also a third
option: prepaid calling cards, a $2.1 billion business.
</P>
<P>
   Prepaid calling cards are a simple product that vendors have
made needlessly complicated _ a problem exacerbated by the fact
that you often have to buy the card without knowing all the charges
up front.
</P>
<P>
   Cards generally require you to dial an access number, either a
toll-free 800 number or a local number. You then punch in a
personal identification number, or PIN, and the number you are
calling to be connected.
</P>
<P>
   Cards are sold by retailers, gas stations, and convenience
stores, and prices can vary significantly on some cards from store
to store. Finding a particular card can also take some work. You
may have to call customer service and ask for the store nearest
you.
</P>
<P>
   Some things to keep in mind when selecting a calling card:
</P>
<P>
   --Will you be calling from home, on the road, or both? Perhaps
you can use a card with a local access number.
</P>
<P>
   --How much does your card charge for directory assistance?
Without a long-distance carrier you won't automatically have
directory assistance.
</P>
<P>
   --Does the card expire or start imposing monthly charges after a
certain amount of time? Also, can the card be recharged, the
industry term for adding additional minutes?
</P>
<P>
   Our favorites of the cards we surveyed were ConeXus of Brookline
and IDT. IDT, which also offers good phone-to-phone Internet
service, had great international and domestic rates. US calls and
calls to directory assistance cost just 7.9 cents a minute and
calls to London and Mexico City were a rock-bottom 10 cents a
minute.
</P>
<P>
   IDT had three negatives. Retailers carrying the card are hard to
find. In addition, the card carries a 99-cent monthly charge and
can't be recharged.
</P>
<P>
   ConeXus's strength is its low, easy-to-understand rates. It
charges 10 cents a minute for US calls if a local access number is
used, or 19 cents a minute if an 800 number is used. The same
charges apply for directory assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ConeXus minutes don't expire and additional minutes can be added
with a recharge card. Best of all, there are no connection fees, no
monthly fees, no pay-phone charges, and no monthly minimums.

ALL THE INTERNET YOU CAN DRINK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By  DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Think of computer data _ text, music, voices,
still pictures, moving pictures, anything you can view or listen
to, get, store or send _ as water, a sloshing ocean of bits of
information washing around the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Now, think of that water flowing through pipes, wires actually,
into your computer.
</P>
<P>
   At home, that flow of water/data is probably pretty slow,
dribbling in actually. Most home PCs sold these days come with a
modem, which serves as the spigot on that water flow, encoding and
decoding a computer's information so it can be sent reliably across
the information ocean to its destination.
</P>
<P>
   Odds are, your computer has a modem that lets data flow at
either 28,800 bits per second, or the increasingly widely used
56,600 bits per second.
</P>
<P>
   The slow drip, drip, drip of Web pages loading through a 56Kbps
or 28.8Kbps modem onto your home computer can become a kind of
Chinese data torture test that will drive an impatient Internet
user mad.
</P>
<P>
   The torture may finally end. The big pipe known as broadband is
coming, and it will let the bits flow as much as 350 times faster
than a 28.8Kbps modem. And at reasonable prices, too.
</P>
<P>
   But what is broadband exactly?
</P>
<P>
   Generally, it's a high-speed Internet connection provided
through one of a group of competing technologies offered by phone
companies, satellite providers and cable-TV firms.
</P>
<P>
   The speed of these connections, and the fact that they are
``always on,'' mean they're likely to change how we use our
computers, the Internet and entertainment in the relatively near
future, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 2 million Americans have some kind of broadband
connection in their home (perhaps 14 million more have a fast
connection at work or school), but that's expected to change
radically in the next 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Both phone and cable companies have finished hammering out
technical questions and are trying to upgrade their wires to
compete for what is expected to be a large market: speeding
interactive information and entertainment of all kinds to the home
over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the crescendo of hype about broadband, you may still
have a hard time getting it in many parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Phone-based digital subscriber lines, or DSL, only work if your
home is within 3.5 miles of the ``central office,'' where the
high-speed switches are located. Cable TV modems require the cable
company to wire a neighborhood, a multibillion-dollar outlay that
means some areas won't get wired for months or years to come. And
satellite systems can be expensive to install for something that
isn't nearly as fast as the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the classic example: I live in a new development, where
there's $500,000 and up houses and most people work in high tech,
but we can't get DSL no matter what we pay, because we're more than
3.5 miles from a central office,'' said Clay Ryder, chief analyst
and vice president of Zone Research Inc. in Redwood City.``I'm
living in the prototypical neighborhood that would want this
service. And yet, I'm unattainable.''
</P>
<P>
   But sooner than you think, this will change, and it'll change
the way you live.
</P>
<P>
   ``Different kinds of Web sites will emerge, with all kinds of
content that you just can't use with a (slower connection),'' said
Bruce Kasrel, a senior analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge,
Mass. ``It's richer, more entertainment oriented, assuming the
person is more at home. It's a fuller experience of the content.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not just the speed, either, that will change things.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike current connections, where you have to dial up a service
provider and wait for a connection, broadband systems let you swim
all the time in the Internet's ocean of data.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers will have this `always on' connection, a big
difference from the dial-up world,'' Kasrel said.
</P>
<P>
   That means people use the Net differently, to check phone
numbers, get map directions, buy theater tickets, get reservations
and do a thousand brief chores.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that minute of time that used to be spent dialing up the
Internet, they're already done,'' Kasrel said. ``There's a lot of
potential quick hits of information that can be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Cable giant MediaOne sponsored an anthropological study of how
people use broadband services and found that its ``always on''
nature meant it was used far more heavily _ and by everyone in the
family, said the company's Kelly Ruebel, a vice president for
marketing and sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``They use it everywhere _ in the kitchen, in the bedroom, in
the family room,'' Ruebel said. ``It's becoming more of an
appliance. It changes the way you use media, because it's faster
and it's packaged for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the differences were obvious at a recent conference for
broadband content developers at Sony Pictures Entertainment's
Culver City studios.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to create a brand-new medium for people,'' said
Michael Sepso of Gotham Interactive, a broadband developer. ``It's
not just a fast Internet. You can make video interactive and maybe
tie it into things we're already used to, like e-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii-based Pixelworld is putting together tourism-oriented
sites connected to specific geographic locales and viewable only on
a high-speed connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're only interested in broadband, that's it,'' said Stephen
Szabo, Pixelworld's production director. ``It gives people a more
compelling experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Pixelworld's Hawaii site, which should launch within a couple of
weeks, will automatically check a visitor's connection speed. If
it's not at least 100 kilobits per second, the site shunts the
visitor to a message that tells where to get a faster connection,
Szabo said.
</P>
<P>
   The site showed excellent-quality live video (about
three-fourths of the normal TV speed of 30 frames per second) shot
from a Hawaii beach as the sun rose. And that was with a temporary
connection cobbled together for the conference.
</P>
<P>
   But a lot of what will come isn't yet clear, because developers
have only just started playing with the medium.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1994, we bet heavily on broadband: The more you give them,
the more they consume,'' said Carl Rogers of cable giant MediaOne.
``But five years ago, nary a word was said about the Internet.
Everyone was enamored with interactive TV. Will we be able to
predict with precision where it will be in the future? I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Online gaming should blossom, for one, Rogers and others said.
</P>
<P>
   Thriving subcultures already exist for the online components of
many computer games; all three next-generation gaming consoles will
have a modem and Internet gaming abilities; and online-only games
such as Ultima Online and Everquest draw thousands of players back
for month after month of play.
</P>
<P>
   With higher-speed connections, all those gaming experiences
should be even more involving, with richer graphics, more
compelling worlds and room for even more competitors to duke it out
in the same world.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll see people creating things specifically for this medium
that you couldn't do before broadband,'' said Patrick Kearney of
Columbia TriStar Digital Media.
</P>
<P>
   Videophone service, Web conferencing, interactive video, stock
tickers, soap opera news, weather reports, streaming video from
ESPN.com, high-quality music, in general lots of ``short and sweet
content bits,'' will be popular, said Kearney.
</P>
<P>
   What probably won't happen is access to an endless shelf of old
TV episodes, said Rob Tercek, Columbia TriStar's vice president of
online services and an adjunct professor at USC's film school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Non-interactive content sucks on the Net,'' Tercek said.
``We're trying to incorporate Web features such as feedback and
customization for this medium. The idea that you can talk back to
your TV is very compelling.''
</P>
<P>
   That means more gaming, more auctions, more chatting and more
``metacontent'' _ data about data, so you can find your way to the
good stuff, Tercek said.
</P>
<P>
   It also means personal TV stations, where some 14-year-old with
a digital video camera is creating his own shows and
``broadcasting'' them. And more reality: weather and traffic. And
lots of selling, with episodic stories worked into commercials and
catalogs, to draw in customers.
</P>
<P>
   MediaOne's Rogers predicted broadband will really blossom
between 2000 to 2002, when enough homes are connected to create the
mass markets that make a new medium possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to boil the ocean tomorrow,'' Rogers said.
``This thing is going to take a couple of years.'' &UR;  &QL;

WHAT CAUSES CANCER? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. How do you get cancer?
</P>
<P>
   P.S., Mattapan, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. There are more than 100 kinds of cancer, but according to
Robert Weinberg, cancer researcher at MIT's Whitehead Institute in
Cambridge, they all have one thing in common. All are caused by
mutations to several genes on the DNA of a single cell. And most of
the damage is done to genes that regulate cell growth.
</P>
<P>
   Most cells only make copies of themselves every once in a while,
usually to replace similar cells that have gotten old or damaged
and have died off. And they only reproduce when molecules called
growth factors land on special receptors on the outside of the cell
membrane. The growth factor sends a message to a chain of proteins
inside the cell, setting off an intracellular game of Post Office.
Each protein interprets the message and either passes it along,
changes it a little, or doesn't pass it along at all. Only the
right message can finally get to the DNA and make the cell
reproduce.
</P>
<P>
   The blueprint for each of those proteins is in the genes on our
DNA. When something mutates the genes that make proteins which
control cell growth, those proteins are defective. They don't work
right. The message in the game of Post Office gets changed. Growth
regulation breaks down and cancer starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cancer,'' says Weinberg, ``is a disease of cells that are
proliferating out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the cell has so many growth-controlling systems
that several mutations have to occur, all in the same cell, before
it becomes cancerous. And the chances of all that happening to just
a few critical sections of one strand of DNA are relatively low.
</P>
<P>
   So what causes these mutations? Sometimes they occur naturally,
when a cell makes a copy of itself and its DNA, and doesn't get
things exactly right. Once every million or ten million times, the
DNA in the daughter cell isn't a precise copy of the DNA in the
mother cell. If that mutation damages a gene that controls cell
growth, it's the first step toward what could become cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a couple of examples.
</P>
<P>
   --The estrogen cycle in women causes monthly bursts of cell
growth. Since women are reaching menstruation at an earlier age,
they are experiencing more menstrual cycles, more cell growth, and
more natural mutation. Scientists think that may be contributing to
higher rates of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   --Heavy alcohol consumption kills cells in the mouth and throat.
That triggers the remaining cells to reproduce and the rate of
natural mutation goes up.
</P>
<P>
   Another source of natural mutation comes from chemicals called
free radicals our cells produce as part of their energy cycle.
Cells can protect against most, but not all, of the internal damage
caused by free radicals.
</P>
<P>
   Genetics plays a role in cancer. A person who inherits a damaged
growth-regulating gene may never develop cancer, but their chances
are much greater because every cell in their body is already one
step down that road.
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg says external factors are the biggest cause of
mutations to our genes. Life style choices like tobacco smoke, diet
(too much fat/too few fruits and vegetables), or too much exposure
to the sun, expose us to carcinogens.
</P>
<P>
   We're also exposed to external carcinogens like radon, motor
vehicle exhaust, and biological agents like viruses.
</P>
<P>
   The scientific war on cancer has produced incredible insights
into how cancer gets going in a cell, and how it spreads throughout
our bodies. Those insights make scientists like Weinberg hopeful
that cures may not be far away. Next week: How cancer spreads.

ALCOHOL USE AND ELDERS A DANGEROUS MIX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For 50 years he was what his wife tactfully called ``an
enthusiastic drinker.'' It didn't stop him from becoming a
high-level public servant and a distinguished professor.
</P>
<P>
   But booze was seriously compromising the life of this
75-year-old Boston man, as it does for millions of older Americans.
</P>
<P>
   He felt draggy and needed a long afternoon nap. His ritual _ up
to two martinis at lunch and two to four at the cocktail hour _ was
taking its toll.
</P>
<P>
   One day last summer he found himself in a room with four medical
specialists who were puzzling over the causes of his hand tremor,
lethargy, back pain, and elevated blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought to myself, `This is a stupid medical maze you're
getting into,' '' he said. ``So for the first time I told my doctor
I was going to quit drinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Quit he did, and he vows it's for good. ``The change has been
dramatic,'' he reports. ``I no longer want to take naps. I'm far
more energetic. And I swim again.''
</P>
<P>
   His story is not uncommon. As many as 17 percent of Americans
over age 60 _ almost six million people _ become seriously
dependent on alcohol or prescription drugs, and often both
together.
</P>
<P>
   Abuse of these legal substances among elders is ``one of the
fastest growing health problems facing the country,'' declared a
consensus panel recently assembled by the federal Substance Abuse
and Mental Health Services Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation remains under-estimated, under-identified,
under-diagnosed, and under-treated,'' the expert group said.
</P>
<P>
   Typical, too, was the Boston man's slowness to realize that he
could no longer handle his liquor the way he'd always been able to.
Indeed, a smaller amount of wine, beer, or spirits packs a bigger
wallop after age 50.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who used to have two martinis and never show it can be
knocked for a loop,'' says Dr. Tom Delbanco, chief of general
medicine and primary care at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center
in Boston
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, this story's happy ending is also surprisingly
common. Once older substance abusers seek help, they're often more
successful abstainers than their younger counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Folks who develop the problem later in life have a better
prognosis,'' says Dr. Richard Saitz of Boston Medical Center.
``They seem to be more motivated to get treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   A study published in the May issue of the Journal of Family
Practice shows that even brief interventions with older ``problem
drinkers'' produce substantial payoffs.
</P>
<P>
   University of Wisconsin researchers reported that two 15-minute
counseling sessions with a family physician, combined with
telephone followup and written educational materials, resulted in a
34 percent reduction in weekly alcohol use, a 74 percent drop in
binge drinking episodes, and a 62 percent fall in the proportion of
patients who consume more than three drinks a day on average.
</P>
<P>
   One explanation for this impressive effect might be that
patients' primary care physicians did the counseling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing,'' says Joyce Sirota, who runs Boston-area
facilities Substance Abuse Services for Seniors at Cambridge and
Somerville Councils on Aging.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to elders whose kids, friends, and neighbors have
urged them to stop drinking. Who did they listen to? Their doctor.
I just wish more physicians were aware that alcohol is often a
problem in elders. They have a great deal of power.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts in the field agree that doctors often don't think to ask
older patients about their drinking patterns, or are reluctant to.
``These patients often present as the sweet little lady next
door,'' Sirota says. ``You'd never dream she has an alcohol
problem. But she takes a couple of sherries before bedtime, and if
she has to get up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom,
she may fall.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, broken bones often bring the problem to light. But a
catastrophic hip fracture is only one of the medical consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol is a factor in a whopping 70 percent of hospital
admissions among patients over 65, according to the US House Select
Committee on Aging.
</P>
<P>
   Other studies indicate that nearly half of all nursing home
residents have alcohol-related problems. Such problems account for
23 percent of Medicare expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   Such figures may seem surprising, since most people don't think
of alcoholism and drug dependence as geriatric issues. But health
professionals are beginning to appreciate the magnitude of the
problem. Just last month, a study in the Journal of the American
Geriatrics Society documented its extent.
</P>
<P>
   A national survey of 3,843 Americans over age 65 revealed that
about half are current drinkers, and a quarter of those drink
daily. ``Intermittent heavy drinking (5 drinks on an occasion) and
regular heavy drinking (more than 2 drinks a day for men, more than
1 drink a day for women) were common'' among elders, reported Dr.
Alison A. Moore and her coworkers at the University of California
at Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Many adults would not consider two or three alcoholic drinks a
day to be ``heavy drinking.'' But in fact, the National Institute
on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism considers one drink a day to be the
acceptable limit for individuals over 60. (A ``drink'' is 12 ounces
of beer, a standard 5.5-ounce glass of wine, or a 1.5-ounce shot of
hard liquor.)
</P>
<P>
   Why the one-drink limit? Once ingested, alcohol migrates to the
body's lean muscle mass and water stores. But, beginning after age
50 (it varies among individuals), elders' bodies progressively lose
muscle mass and water, so a given amount of alcohol results in a
higher concentration than in younger individuals.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, elders' stomachs produce less of an enzyme called
alcohol dehydrogenase, which breaks alcohol down. And if they're
taking commonly prescribed antacid drugs such as Zantac and
Tagamet, the enzyme is further suppressed. The result: more
unmodified alcohol gets into the bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   The liver is a third factor. Even in elders without liver
disease, this organ is pressed into daily service to metabolize
prescription drugs. Drinking alcohol imposes an additional burden
on the liver, which can affect blood levels of both alcohol and
medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody may figure, `Well, if I've always had four drinks a
day and now I've cut down to two drinks, it must be fine,' '' said
Saitz of Boston Medical Center. ``But you can be developing a
problem even though you're drinking less.''
</P>
<P>
   Among elders, an alcohol problem ``can creep up on you,'' agrees
Jeanne Martin, a health educator at Kit Clark Senior Services
Center in Boston's Dorchester neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Few older people are aware, moreover, of the long list of
medications that can be affected in various ways, dramatic and
subtle, by alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Most common and most dangerous is the interaction of alcohol and
sedatives, sleeping pills, and tranquilizers. After heart
medications, drugs like these, many in a class called
benzodiazapines, are the most commonly prescribed medications among
elders. Mixed with alcohol, such central nervous system depressants
can cause coma and even death. Alcohol can also affect blood
pressure (in both directions) and interfere with seizure medicines,
heart drugs, blood thinners, antidepressants, and a common
antibiotic called Flagyl.
</P>
<P>
   Over-the-counter drugs are also affected by alcohol ingestion,
which can enhance the sedative effect of the antihistamines in cold
remedies _ a particular hazard for older drivers. One
under-appreciated danger is the liver damage, sometimes
catastrophic, that can occur when Tyelenol (acetominophen), one of
the most common arthritis remedies, is combined with regular
alcohol consumption, even at a low level.
</P>
<P>
   ``These interactions can be very subtle and confusing to doctor
and patient alike,'' says Delbanco of Beth Israel Deaconess. ``Very
often the alcohol factor is missed.''
</P>
<P>
   The chances of recognizing the alcohol factor are also reduced
by the fact that many elders lead solitary and isolated lives.
</P>
<P>
   Secretive drinking is common, and friends and family members may
abet the habit with such attitudes as ``It's the only pleasure she
has left'' or ``He's too old to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Well-meaning as these sentiments may be, they do no favor to the
elder with drinking problems, experts stress. Rather than a
well-deserved ``pleasure,'' alcohol can worsen depression, not to
mention the risk of falling and medication complications. Friends,
family, and caregivers have a duty to intervene _ in a supportive,
non-confrontational way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if they rebuff you or act offended, the bottom line is
not to abandon hope that you will be able to get through to the
person,'' says Jane Trollinger of Jewish Memorial. ``Keep trying to
find a way, because you may be someone's only hope.''
</P>
<P>
   The payoff, as the retired Boston professor finally discovered,
can be enormous. ``There's an ageist myth out there that older
people can't change,'' says Martin of the Kit Clark Center.
``That's not true. We've seen wonderful changes.''

`RESURRECTION MAN' HAS APPEAL; `8MM' JUST FLOPS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW RELEASES: ``Resurrection Man'' _ There's something about
Irish and English gangster movies, even ones as violent as this
one, that's appealing. This one echoes the political strife in
Northern Ireland in a style familiar from, say, ``The Krays.''
Tough and not for the squeamish, it's ultra-violent but
ultra-intelligent as well. Look for ``My Left Foot'' star Brenda
Fricker as a goon's mother. She's terrific.
</P>
<P>
   ``8MM'' _ Director Joel Schumacher, one of the industry's most
overrated auteurs, lets this Nicolas Cage movie about a private eye
investigating the world of snuff movies just fall apart. It has no
focus and, midway through, it drops the moral issues it raises in
favor of action sequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's All That'' _ This
ugly-duckling-kissed-by-the-handsome-prince story was stale 50
years before they made it. Stars Freddie Prinze Jr. and Rachel
Leigh Cook seem destined for better than this hackneyed romance.
Either that or it's ``Fries with that?''

BROADBAND CHOICES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By  DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; Telephone &UR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
What technology: &UR;  &LR; Various flavors of what's generically known as
Digital Subscriber Lines, or DSL. The most common DSL technology
for home use is called asymmetric, or ADSL, because the speed of
your downloads is much faster than speed sending information out.
</P>
<P>
   Strengths: Uses regular phone line. Always on, for easy access.
Also, you can ``split'' your line, getting a phone call while
surfing the Net and sending a fax.  &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Weaknesses: Only available within 3.5 miles of the phone
company's ``central office,'' where the DSL switches are housed.
More and more central offices are getting hooked up, including many
in the Valley and surrounding areas, but you could still be too far
away. DSL has lower top speeds than cable modems, and costs more.
You still have to get an Internet service provider for an extra $20
a month. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Speed vs. price: Up to 6 megabits per second, though typical
guaranteed service level priced for home use is more like 384
kilobits (384,000 bits) per second, for a price of around $40 to
$60 a month.
</P>
<P>
   What to look for: Shop around. You have a variety of choices
besides your local Baby Bell for DSL service, and what they charge
for equipment, establishing service and monthly charges can vary
quite a bit. Lots of smaller companies looking to build a business
are offering good deals and specialized expertise. Not every
Internet service provider has a deal with every DSL provider, so
you may have to move e-mail addresses to get faster speeds.  &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Where to look: The number of companies offering DSL is
expanding rapidly, but start with places such as Pacific Bell
(www.pacbell.com/products/fastrak/dsl), GTE (www.gte.com), Sprint
(www.sprint.com and has a partnership with Pasadena ISP Earthlink)
and Covad (www.covad.com ). &UR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Cable television &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; What technology: Cable TV modems &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Strengths: Superfast, when no one else is on your local loop.
Always on. Cheaper for the speed. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Weaknesses: It's a shared network, so when everyone in the
neighborhood gets on at once, your access speed plummets. And
shared network means potential security vulnerabilities. Not
available until cable company wires your neighborhood. And no
choice of provider (now, at least, in most of the country); it's
whatever broadband provider your cable company has designated and
only that one.
</P>
<P>
   Speed vs. price: Up to 10 megabits (10 million) per second, for
$30 to $40 a month. Real speed depends on who else is using your
connection at the same time. Hope for a bunch of clueless
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   What to look for: Ask about their security measures to prevent
easy snooping by others in your computer. Because you're on a
shared network that's always on and very fast, your computer can be
a terrific place for a cracker to poke through.
</P>
<P>
   Where to look: Home (www.home.com or Roadrunner
(www.MediaOneRR.com), the two main broadband providers in the cable
world. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
S &LR; atellite services &UR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; What technology: Satellite service. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Strengths: Available just about anywhere, as long as you have a
clear spot to erect a satellite dish. Only one satellite company
providing the big pipe, but you can pick whomever you want to
provide Internet services on that pipe. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Weaknesses: Good speed, but top end is far below competitors,
and that speed is available only one way, for downloading. Sending
stuff back up to the Net still requires a pokey old telephone line.
You still have to dial in each time you want to get online, too.
</P>
<P>
   Speed vs. price: 400 kilobits per second top speed; as little as
$19.99 a month for 25 hours of use.
</P>
<P>
   What to look for: Current price structures are cheap on the
front end but come with a lot of fine print, such as an hourly
charge after as little as 25 hours of use a month. They bill a
minimum five minutes for every connect, too. That can add up fast
if you're a serious Web head.  &UR;

BANDS ACROSS THE WATER 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BOSTON -- Just imagine the scene: The Boston band Willard Grant
Conspiracy is onstage at a lovely, 500-seat theater. The room is so
quiet you could hear a pin drop between notes. Hardly a party
crowd, Willard Grant Conspiracy's audience is here for one thing:
an earful of fractured, eerily languid lo-fi country songs. In
fact, the group's dedicated following began turning out in force
even before the 3-year-old ensemble had a record deal. Recently,
rave reviews of WGC's two CDs in major newpapers and music
magazines have turned them into a headlining tour band.
</P>
<P>
   What's that? You say you've never heard of Willard Grant
Conspiracy? You're not alone. Most of us have to use our
imaginations _ because the concert described above didn't take
place in Boston. Or anywhere else in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Willard Grant Conspiracy is one of the growing numbers of
artists who are making it bigger _ and faster _ overseas than in
their own backyard. By the end of this summer, WGC will have
completed five extensive tours of Europe, playing in nightclubs,
churches, theaters, and festivals. Of course, they do play locally,
too _ an occasional residency at T. T. the Bear's or the Lizard
Lounge in Cambridge, and a couple of trips a year to Chicago and
Athens, Ga., both towns where the band has a devoted cult
following. But the measure of success Willard Grant Conspiracy has
earned in this country doesn't compare with its achievements
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Willard Grant does 10 times more in sales over there than they
do here,'' says George Howard, president of the Salem-based Slow
River Records, WGC's label. ``They go over and headline, and draw
well. I think they'll do that here. It just takes much, much
longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Jazz musicians have a long history of sustaining successful
careers abroad; there is, simply, a larger and more serious
following for jazz overseas. Many jazz artists sign their contracts
with foreign labels and make a majority of their income outside of
the United States. But America has always been ground zero for rock
'n' roll _ not simply its birthplace, but to many around the world
a mythical place: part heartland, part Hollywood, and the perennial
Land of Dreams.
</P>
<P>
   That powerful musical mythology, says Lenny George of London's
Forward Agency Booking, fuels the European appetite for American
music. George books Willard Grant Conspiracy as well as Calexico,
an indie-Americana unit, and the Gourds, from Texas. ``Alternative
country is particularly popular in Europe,'' says George, who
explains that it's not merely the style of music, but the source,
that has captured listeners' imaginations. ``I think because these
bands are American it makes the music sound authentic, even if
they're actually far away from where that music comes from. If a
British band played, it wouldn't be the same. There's absolutely
still this mystique around American music. When these bands come
here to play, it's an event.''
</P>
<P>
   For Slow River's Howard, those events have inspired a business
approach that's become the defining feature of his record company.
``Europe is a totally different market. You don't need the radio as
much,'' says Howard, whose label roster also includes
singer-songwriter Josh Rouse, country singer Tom Leach, electronic
dance band Future Bible Heroes, and Tom Waits's longtime cohort
Chuck E. Weiss. In the United States, getting radio airplay is one
of the biggest hurdles to breaking a band: Without it, you have
little hope of selling CDs.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Building band equity
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, Howard explains, ``people are much more motivated to
go out and buy records based on press. You can really create
awareness just through reviews. People will buy the CDs and go to
the show.'' And that translates to equity in a band _ equity that
makes it possible for a small company like Slow River to keep an
up-and-coming band like Willard Grant Conspiracy on the label.
``It's a way to increase revenues that allow me to develop bands
over here,'' says Howard, ``because they've already been profitable
over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard made the decision to schedule the overseas release of
Willard Grant Conspiracy's most recent album, 1998's ``Flying
Low,'' six months earlier than its domestic release. The result?
Glowing press from such credible commentators as the London Sunday
Times, New Musical Express, and Mojo to accompany the CD when it
went out to tastemakers in the States. ``The reality,'' Howard
says, ``is that I have a story to bring over here. You're writing
about them because of their success over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Overseas markets can present an extraordinary opportunity for
artists with no label, management, or publicity support _ artists
who are, quite literally, out on their own. Five years ago Boston
folk-rocker Sara Wheeler went to Japan on the advice of a Berklee
professor. She didn't speak the language; she had only a few
secondhand contacts, and no connections for setting up live shows.
Undaunted, guitar in hand, Wheeler stayed in Tokyo for six months.
``It took me about three months to get going,'' Wheeler says, ``but
I soon realized I could make a fortune if I made a CD and brought
it back over. It's very much a consumer culture.''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what she did. After returning home to record a
self-financed CD, Wheeler returned to Japan with her recording. It
sold like hotcakes, and Wheeler became a formidable draw in that
country. ``I could go there for a few months and pay for my career
here, which was losing money,'' says Wheeler, who has recorded four
self-released CDs and now has three booking agents in Europe. She
tours abroad, with her band, three times a year. Based on her
success overseas, Wheeler joined a college booking association
stateside, and has in the last year become a staple on the US
college concert circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Europe remains not only a generally more receptive
touring destination, but a more affordable one as well. The dense
concentration of countries and, in turn, venues means that an
artist can play more gigs in fewer travel days. Plus, there are
many more high-paying rock festivals in Europe, and they typically
pay a couple of thousand dollars or more for one show.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason Willard Grant Conspiracy's career is moving
along faster overseas than it is here, according to WGC singer and
songwriter Robert Fisher, is that it has been more cost-effective
for the band to tour abroad. ``If we had the chance to spend the
same amount of time and effort playing here I think the results
would be more even,'' says Fisher. ``The US is expensive to play.
We've also been blessed with having very good booking agents in
Europe who have helped to raise the band's profile there. In the US
we are still looking for a booking agent.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A stress-free package
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mirko Arrigoni, an agent at Switzerland's Backstage Support,
which books Sara Wheeler, says that the firm does everything it can
to give its American clients a stress-free experience. ``What we
try to do for the American artists is to offer a package,''
Arrigoni says. ``That means from the moment the band is out of the
plane they do not have to worry for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   That sort of care and attention to detail seems to reflect the
overall level of respect given to musicians overseas. When it
started out 10 years ago, the Boston rock band Buffalo Tom made its
name in Britain, Holland, Belgium, and Germany. ``We did our own
headlining tour in those countries before we could even get a
headlining gig at T.T.'s,'' says singer-guitarist Bill Janovitz.
``And we were treated as visiting artists rather than someone who
is there to sell beer until the dance crowd comes in. You get fed
very good meals, often home-cooked, and you get to play through
better sound systems, run by professionals.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, cracking the mainstream in America is, as Janovitz
points out, ``like winning the lottery in terms of commercial
rewards. The market is just so huge.'' Buffalo Tom has become one
of Boston's most prominent rock bands, and has flirted with
mainstream success _ some radio play and MTV exposure, plenty of
critical praise _ during the past decade. A year ago the band
signed to the Polydor label, which released Buffalo Tom's sixth
album, ``Smitten,'' and Janovitz says that the last couple of US
tours have drawn audiences that are beginning to compare with those
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, being one of those expatriate artists who isn't as
respected, or is even unknown, in his own country sounds more
romantic than it actually is,'' Janovitz says. ``I want to live
here and make a living here.'' Hitting the big time at home,
however, ``isn't always satisfying in and of itself,'' Janovitz
says. Wherever one happens to be on the planet, ``respect is the
thing that many musicians want.''
</P>
<P>
   Willard Grant Conspiracy's Fisher concurs. ``The concept of
having made it is limiting,'' he says. ``When have you made it?
When your music has given someone pleasure? Is it when you have
reached a point, even briefly, where the music pays for itself? Is
it accolades, awards, and record sales? I know far too many bands
whose music I respect and to whom I owe a great musical debt who
could only answer affirmatively to the first question.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Willard Grant Conspiracy will set off next month
for Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal,
Slovenia, and the Czech Republic. Wheeler returned to Switzerland,
after a weeklong layover at home in Boston, last week. And they
won't be alone. Clubs and theaters around the world will be filled
with American artists playing every style of music for eager fans
who haven't seen the video or heard the hit single. The business of
making music, it would seem, is based on a far simpler equation
across the pond and away from the US corporate machinery: Make good
music, and the people will come.

ONLINE WORLD AT WAR OVER CABLE ACCESS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Forget Department of Justice vs. Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most interesting legal battles being fought in the
technology world is pitting phone companies and Internet service
providers such as America Online against cable companies,
particularly the nation's biggest cable operator, phone giant AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Major Internet companies such as AOL have been lobbying hard, at
every governmental level from the Federal Communications Commission
to the Los Angeles City Council, to force cable companies to act
more like phone companies and face competition.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to hook your PC to cable right now, you'll only have
one choice in your Internet service provider, probably either
Roadrunner or ExciteHome, depending on your cable company. That may
change, given a series of fights around the country now going on.
</P>
<P>
   AOL and its allies won a potentially pivotal Oregon court
decision requiring open access there this spring. Just this week,
their side won a similar battle in the Florida county where Fort
Lauderdale is located.
</P>
<P>
   Two bills to force open competition nationally are currently
floating in the U.S. House of Representatives. State Sen. Richard
Alarcon, D-Van Nuys, has also introduced a bill in the California
Legislature to do the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Cable companies and AT&AMP;T, which recently spent $114 billion to
buy two of the nation's largest cable companies (which in turn own
large portions of Roadrunner and ExciteHome), have fought that
effort strenuously, with support from the FCC's chairman, Los
Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and others.
</P>
<P>
   They argue that if they have to open their cable modem systems
to competitors, it will slow their construction process by years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking several billion dollars before all that
infrastructure is upgraded, and then you have to look at the
economics of it,'' said Clay Ryder, vice president and senior
analyst for Zona Research Inc. in Redwood City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you have the battle (in cable company executives' minds)
of, `Can I have more pay-per-view channels, or do I provide
broadband?''' Ryder said. ``Does TCI want to plunge billions of
dollars into making all this stuff, then have to sell it to their
competitors? They'd rather do one channel with Home, instead of
opening up their entire network to their competitors.'' &QL;

MOVIES RECENTLY REVIEWED IN THE BOSTON GLOBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   !!! 1/2 ``The Blair Witch Project'' The conceit here is that we
are watching found footage left behind by a trio of students who
went into the woods to film something horrible and were never seen
again. It works with the clammy, unnerving force of a bad dream.
Like so many potent horror movies, it's fed by a cheesy, primal
look _ and it gets much more mileage from dread than most films in
the genre do from gore. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! 1/2 ``Eyes Wide Shut'' Stanley Kubrick's swan song isn't the
great film we had hoped for. Its attempt to transplant sexual
anxiety from fin de siecle Vienna to contemporary Manhattan is only
skin deep, with the sexual energy of a dead battery. Tom Cruise and
Nicole Kidman throw themselves at their dissatisfied-married-couple
roles earnestly, but to limited effect. The film's achievements are
largely stylistic, with an downbeat orgy scene right out of the
Grim Reaper party manual. (R)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
! ``Lake Placid'' Yet another lame ``Jaws'' wannabe, this time
involving a 30-foot Asian croc terrorizing a lake in Maine,
scarfing down whatever it can get its teeth on. In the best
Hollywood tradition, it respectfully refrains from lunching on
cliche-hobbled stars Bridget Fonda, Bill Pullman, Oliver Platt, and
Brendan Gleeson. (R)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! 1/2 ``The Wood'' A groom disappears hours before he's to say ``I
do.'' As he agonizes over whether to go through with the wedding,
he and his two pals reminisce about their friendship. This romantic
comedy is blessed with charismatic performances by a talented group
of young actors. However, the screenplay by 26-year-old newcomer
Rick Famuyiwa is occasionally plagued with unoriginal comedic
situations. (R) (Vanessa E. Jones)

`EVITA' RETURNS _ WITH A SPANISH ACCENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MCCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- For Natalie Toro, playing any Spanish-speaking
character is something of a novelty, let alone playing one of
history's most powerful.
</P>
<P>
   Toro is the latest actress to play the title role in ``Evita,''
the Tim Rice-Andrew Lloyd Webber Tony Award-winning musical, which
opens in a new production at the Colonial Theatre July 21 and
continues through Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Che and I are Latins,'' Toro says, referring to Raul Esparza,
who plays Che Guevara, a sort of Greek chorus for anti-Evita
sentiment, in the musical. Toro says she and Esparza are
``passionate people in real life. We've lived the Latin culture
every day. We're not people who have to study it to find out what
it's about. Not that you can learn a culture just by studying it,
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first Spanish character I've played in my career,
the first Latin character. Che and I click because we're Latin.
We're two magnets. What we do together is different every show.''
</P>
<P>
   Toro played Eponine in ``Les Miserables'' on Broadway. She has
created roles in the American premiere of Cameron Mackintosh's
``The Fix'' and Alan Mencken's ``A Christmas Carol.''
</P>
<P>
   Toro's first brush with Evita came ``five or six years ago,''
when she had to learn the role on a crash basis in Buffalo. But
this time she's watched documentaries and an A &AMP; E biography and
read ``five or six'' books, including Evita's autobiography, which
consists of letters and poems written to her husband. ``I learned
from the words, which are passionate. She's dramatic in words. And
she was not a natural writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was not a good actress,'' Toro continues. ``The best role
she played was herself. . . . When she married (Argentine dictator
Juan) Peron, she changed the facts of her life, she romanticized
it. She lied about her illegitimacy and her birth date. She had the
power to do it. You don't know which is fact and which is fiction
in her life. She changed so much of her life that she believed what
she changed herself.''
</P>
<P>
   The context for Evita's significance, Toro says, is that
``Argentines had never seen a woman in power. She was a star to the
people. She thought she was a great person. She gave a lot to the
poor. She built `Evita villages,' where the poor could live in
furnished homes. She created (trade) unions. She got women the
vote. She changed Argentina's history. She was crooked. Nobody knew
where the money went. She paraded around in furs. She's the
best-written character to play in history.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Full-time Evita
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Toro says she's onstage for two hours and 15 minutes, ``showing
every emotion (Evita) felt that you can play. I'm onstage full
time. There are 14 costume changes. I sing every number. It's the
most difficult role I've ever played, physically and emotionally.
That's why you need two Evitas.''
</P>
<P>
   She's referring to Ana Maria Andricain, a Broadway actress who
shares the title role with her, playing Evita at matinees. Raymond
Jaramillo McLeod is Peron, Evita's husband and power source.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evita'' has been both a movie and a stage musical. Alan
Parker's 1996 movie, starring Madonna as Evita, received five Oscar
nominations, winning for best song, and also was awarded three
Golden Globes, including best picture (musical or comedy). The
stage musical originated as a 1976 concept album and, in 1979,
became one of the first Broadway mega-musicals and then a global
phenomenon. It has set records for the largest box office advance,
the show with the highest pop music profile, and the show with the
most technologically advanced production.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first Broadway show to replicate its original staging
and to make a worldwide impact. The production was successfully
staged in many major cities, including Istanbul, where it was the
first Broadway musical ever to be presented. It played in the
Philippines after being banned under the Marcos regime because of
parallels to Imelda Marcos. Four of the show's songs, including the
breakout hit ``Don't Cry for Me, Argentina,'' were recorded
countless times globally and spent years on the world's pop charts.
The Broadway-cast album won a Grammy in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Prince, the legendary Broadway director-producer who was
the original director of ``Evita'' in 1976 in London and also
directed two years later in New York, is enthusiastic about this
production after seeing the first run-through at rehearsal. From
his home in the French Alps near Geneva, Prince, whose original
choreographer, Larry Fuller, is directing this ``Evita,'' said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to Dallas, saw it and I am very pleased. It plays well.
The Latin casting was a good idea. The changes are authentic, and
that's nice. The performers are talented and do a good job. It's
impeccable. I'm very pleased. It's faithful to the original.''
</P>
<P>
   Prince became involved with the show because Lloyd Webber and
Rice sent the London Symphony recording to him. The recording
opened with the festival in front of the presidential mansion in
Buenos Aires. It's the first sequence in the movie. ``We (took our
cue from that and) started with 200 people onstage. It was
challenging and very exciting. In 18 months, we'd taken the sleeve
of the record album with all of the lyrics and put it into script
form. I saw where there were empty places and gratuitous material.
Some stories went. I'd ask for _ or where it was needed _ a song.
We needed one for how she'd engineered her meeting with (Peron).''
</P>
<P>
   Prince said that when Evita was on her way up, she was ``the
Barbara Walters of radio.'' He also remarked that she was
``clever'' in that ``she got both the haves and the have-nots.''
Asked what he might have meant by that, Toro said: ``You know how
Barbara Walters gets anyone she wants to to talk to her? That's
what Evita did. She was a manipulator. She got people to do things
for her sometimes without even being aware of what she was doing.
She didn't have the knowledge of how to do it. She just did it. She
and her husband loved and used each other. She wanted to be vice
president. He let her do it. In a lot of stuff he gave her free
reign. She just went for it. Without her, after she died, he was
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Prince describes ``Evita'' as ``Brecht, Weill, and agitprop.
It's its own thing. It generated excitement in London, all over
Europe, and in Majorca. . . . When Americans come to see a show in
Europe, you know it's potent material. This was the first of the
really long runs. I have to feel good about it myself. I never
predicted its success. I never know. All I can say about what I do
is that sometimes my taste dovetails with what I want to do.''

WHY THE DVD IS HERE TO STAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seems that every time a new video technology emerges, it's
lauded as the greatest advance since Al Jolson destroyed the silent
film with those immortal words ``You ain't heard nothin' yet'' in
1927's ``The Jazz Singer.'' Remember Beta? Laserdiscs? Super VHS?
DIVX went belly up last month.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the DVD (digital versatile disc), a format destined to
replace VHS, is fulfilling the promise. While there are still only
about 4,000 titles available _ in contrast to nearly 68,000 VHS
tapes _ the DVD is setting a faster sales pace than VHS. According
to Martin Greenwald, president of Image Entertainment, one of the
nation's leading independent DVD distributors, DVD households are
up from 1 million in 1998 to a projected 3 million by the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Panasonic has sold 40 million VCRs,'' says Greenwald. ``If
they can sell 40 million DVD players and make $10 bucks a machine,
that's $400 million. No one's going to turn that down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From day one, we have said that the DVD format is for keeps,''
says Michael Dubelko, president and founder of DVD EXPRESS
(www.dvdexpress.com), a Web site competing with amazon.com and
netflix.com, among others, for on-line DVD sales.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of DVD is not surprising. In some cases, watching a
movie at home on DVD is preferable to seeing it in a theater: The
image is clearer, the sound is better, and, in most cases, the
seats are much more comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   The other advantage is the capacity of each disc. On one side,
an entire film can be stored, and the other can contain special
features such as the director's commentary and information on the
making of the film.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery,'' there's an
additional soundtrack on which star Mike Myers and director Jay
Roach talk through the movie. It's like a more amusing version of
``Mystery Science Theater 3000,'' with Myers claiming that the
casting of Elizabeth Hurley wasn't all based on her credits from
the Actors Studio. The DVD version also includes two alternate
endings and seven scenes deleted from the original. Shagademics
should have a field day composing doctoral dissertations on Dr.
Evil's fiendish plans as a metaphor for Margaret Thatcher's
England. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Careless with Kubrick &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad they didn't take the same care with one of the
year's most-anticipated releases _ ``The Stanley Kubrick
Collection.'' MGM, Columbia Tri-Star, and Warner Home Video got
together and assembled seven of the director's finest films _ ``Dr.
Strangelove,'' ``Lolita,'' ``2001: A Space Odyssey,'' ``A Clockwork
Orange,'' ``The Shining,'' ``Barry Lyndon,'' and ``Full Metal
Jacket.'' Except for a fascinating documentary done by Kubrick's
daughter, Vivian, on the making of ``The Shining'' and sharp prints
of ``Strangelove,'' ``Lyndon,'' and ``2001,'' the collection is
disappointing. Kubrick is one of the few filmmakers whose work can
benefit from additional scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's unlikely that he would have cooperated with a
narrative tour through his oeuvre, Kubrick certainly would have
demanded better copies of his films. ``The Shining,'' in
particular, looks as if it had been created from an old dirty
print. Scratches, lines, and other debris associated with a used
print are evident. Also, it's not in the correct aspect ratio, so
you rarely get the effect of the film's full frame.
</P>
<P>
   However, ``The Killing'' looks great with its crisp
black-and-white high-contrast cinematography, and ``Barry Lyndon''
has never looked better. It would be interesting to hear interviews
with those associated with Kubrick's films and discussions among
critics and scholars about his work. But there's none of that. It
seems that Warner Home Video, in particular, was in such a hurry to
take promotional advantage of the release of ``Eyes Wide Shut'' it
didn't have time to do a proper job.
</P>
<P>
   Warner should have taken a lesson from Criterion _ the best
company around for respecting the art of film and making sure that
the additional features are first-rate. Laurence Olivier's ``Henry
V'' is a case in point.
</P>
<P>
   Actor-producer-director Olivier brought Shakespeare's massive
historical drama to brilliant Technicolor life; his version was
released in 1944-45. And it's all on regal display in the DVD
edition. Aside from the vivid colors, reborn after years of neglect
on the TV and sub-run routes, the disc also includes commentary by
film historian Bruce Eder, a chronology of England's royalty,
stills from the original production, and subtitles for
hearing-impaired viewers. Even for those who resist Shakespeare,
this is a treasure.
</P>
<P>
   The other English film that's treated royally is the
much-underrated ``Elizabeth.'' Aside from magnificent audio-video
reproduction, an additional track contains smart, entertaining
interviews with Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush as well as
director Shekhar Kapur, who seems as guileless as he is talented.
In one section, he reveals his torturous dealings with the actress
signed to play one of the women burned at the stake. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Not an improvement &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are some films that cannot be improved from the movie
theater to home video, and David Rabe's ``Hurlyburly'' is one of
them. Playwright Rabe shares pretentious nonsense with the film's
director, Anthony Drazan, on one track while the self-absorbed
actors discuss their work on another.
</P>
<P>
   But ``A Simple Plan'' is terrific. Director Sam Raimi really
hits his stride with this dark, complicated story of how regular
friends and neighbors are slowly overtaken by greed and evil.
Presented in wide-screen format, the Paramount release deserves the
sort of extras wasted on ``Hurlyburly.'' It would be great to hear
Raimi, whose previous work was basically well-shot horror stuff
such as ``The Evil Dead,'' explain some of his decisions. Even
without elucidation from cast and crew, this is a great film
professionally realized on DVD.
</P>
<P>
   For fans of ``Patch Adams'' (I'm not one of them), the producers
have released a collector's edition. There are loony outtakes from
lunatic Robin Williams and a promotional feature on the making of
the film.
</P>
<P>
   A treasure among the DVDs is last week's release of the uncut
``Brazil,'' with all the bells and whistles imaginable. The only
unfair cut is felt by those who purchased the first version
released on DVD last year. There's no comparison between the two.
Director Terry Gilliam oversaw the development of the new,
three-disc boxed set, which includes the 142-minute director's cut,
the 90-minute studio release, and many other features that fans of
the film will adore. The best addition is a discussion between
screenwriters Tom Stoppard and Charles McKeown about how the script
evolved.
</P>
<P>
   While the DVD version of Alfred Hitchcock's ``Strangers on a
Train'' doesn't break any new ground, it does include two complete
versions of the film. Side A is the American version, which played
in repertory for years, and side B is the British version, which is
much darker and allows for a far more flamboyant performance by
Farley Granger.
</P>
<P>
   The American Western, except for an elegant wide-screen version
of John Ford's ``The Searchers'' and a state-of-the-art
presentation of Sam Peckinpah's ``The Wild Bunch,'' isn't really
well represented on DVD. ``The Wild Bunch'' is the standard by
which future Westerns should be judged on DVD. The package includes
a completely remastered wide-screen version and a marvelous
documentary on the making of the film with intelligent comments by
William Holden. Plans are in the works for DVD versions of ``She
Wore a Yellow Ribbon'' and ``Rio Bravo.'' Also, Paramount Pictures,
one of the last studios to hop aboard the DVD bandwagon, is lagging
behind as collectors eagerly await films such as ``Chinatown'' and
``The Godfather.''
</P>
<P>
   But analysts believe the next big rush for DVD players will be
when Disney brings its classic animation to the new format. Aside
from the built-in marketability of such great films as ``Snow White
and the Seven Dwarfs'' ``Pinocchio,'' ``Peter Pan,'' and ``Lady and
the Tramp,'' Disney also has access to a huge library of supporting
material. Ever since Walt Disney began producing feature-length
animation in 1937, he kept records of the process. When he produced
``Disneyland'' and ``The Wonderful World of Disney'' for
television, his company made documentaries on each of his
theatrical films, and they ran as informational promotions. Now
Buena Vista Home Video can reach into the Disney archives and
create some of the best ancillary features for the anticipated DVD
releases. There are no release dates set for the Disney classics,
but it's safe to say that they might be issued a few months before
Michael Eisner's next contract renewal.

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ To hear it from Bill Powers, it's basically been
smooth sailing for the state Republican Committee in the two weeks
Hillary Rodham Clinton has traveled across New York in her
exploratory campaign for the U.S. Senate. And the few bumps along
the way are the kind the Republican Party chairman likes.
</P>
<P>
   Powers says the phone has been ringing off the hook at the party
headquarters, and on the line are donors ready and willing to shell
out for the likely race against the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've noticed a significant bump'' in contributions, Powers
said with a grin on Friday, although he declined to detail just how
much more money has been made through the deluge of telemarketing
and mailings since the start of the month. ``It's great. It has
helped us a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared to Clinton's charge-ahead listening tour, state
Republicans are easing into the race still 16 months away. Three
GOP contenders _ New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Reps.
Rick Lazio and Peter King of Long Island _ are eying the job held
now by the retiring Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   If _ or when _ they decide to run, that would mean state
Republicans would face an uncomfortable, and apparently inevitable,
bump in the road: a primary for the GOP nomination. Such a contest
threatens to split the party, and gobble their resources, just
before the winner faces the Democratic nominee next fall.
</P>
<P>
   Powers, a former Marine, already is gearing up to reunite his
troops after September 2000 in the event of an interparty war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through a lot of primaries. I don't like them, but
I've been through them,'' Powers said. He will not openly support
any of the three contenders right now, and hopes there may not even
be a primary: ``You hope that like-minded people agree on a
stronger candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, only one of the three Republican hopefuls appears ready
to take the plunge: Lazio. The four-term congressman plans to kick
off his campaign before Labor Day, and the only thing that would
turn him back now is his family or other ``personal reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   How about if he doesn't curry the support of Gov. George Pataki?
``I don't expect that's going to happen,'' said Lazio, at least
quietly reveling in the rift between the governor and Giuliani _ a
power struggle that began with the mayor's 1994 endorsement of
Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo over Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every place I have been, I have been met with support and
enthusiasm and frankly, a lot of kindness,'' Lazio said. ``Not one
soul upstate has expressed a serious problem with a Republican
primary. I think it's a huge misconception that allowing the people
to decide who the candidate is going to be is a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   National Republicans _ who discourage a primary but have agreed
to stay out of New York's business _ estimate the Senate 2000
campaign will cost around $30 million for both the primary and
general election. So far this year, the New York Republican State
Committee has collected $418,000 in contributions in its state
fund-raising account. Its federal account had $419,000 in
contributions as of Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   In the last four months alone, Giuliani has raised $2.5 million
for his exploratory campaign. Yet Giuliani is still very much
undecided on whether he'll run, said political adviser Bruce
Teitelbaum.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are obviously several factors that he will have to look
at _ whether or not the support is there, whether this is something
he really wants to do, politically or professionally,'' Teitelbaum
said.
</P>
<P>
   King said his chances of running stand right now at about 50-50.
But he is the quickest to acknowledge the importance of third-party
candidates in the race. As the staunchest abortion foe among the
three, King would probably win the support of the Right-To-Life
Party. The Conservative Party, at this point, favors Lazio. And
Giuliani, who carried the Liberal Party ballot line in his two wins
for mayor, likely would carry it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger and the worst case scenario is for each of us to be
willing to run on different (ballot) lines,'' King said. ``There's
no real way around that; that is going to be the dilemma. Even with
Giuliani, say he only runs on the Liberal line. He's not an
800-pound gorilla anymore. But he's a 400-pound gorilla.''

   Clinton so far refuses to talk about her potential opponents,
saying ``there will be plenty of time to draw whatever
comparisons'' as campaigning continues.
</P>
<P>
   Early polling indicates that in the event of a three-way race
among Clinton, Giuliani and Lazio, the first lady would have a
slight edge. But a Clinton-Giuliani matchup would break for the
Republicans, according to a recent poll by the Marist Institute for
Public Opinion.
</P>
<P>
   But even winning is not everything to some political leaders in
play. Having an ideologically correct candidate is more important,
said Michael Long, chairman of the state Conservative Party.
</P>
<P>
   Even if it's a candidate who cannot beat Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly we want to win,'' Long said Friday. ``But winning
isn't everything that we do....I certainly don't want to send to
the Senate anyone that's going to wind up voting on the Democratic
side more than on the Republican conservative side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly the person with the most name ID right now is Rudy
Giuliani,'' Long said. ``But I submit to you that it's a long way
(to next year). I'm not sure what happens then.''

RESEARCHERS TARGET CANCER CELLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By PHIL DAVIS 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Cancer hunter Richard Cote's job would be easy if
he were merely searching for that proverbial needle in a haystack.
Try finding a single, imperceptibly unique needle in a pile of a
million needles.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Southern California pathologist hunts the most
elusive of cancers _ the occult metastases, a lethal microscopic
rogue that easily slips past the most advanced diagnostic
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're talking about is the ability to detect one tumor
cell in a background of 1 million normal cells, so this goes well
beyond a pinpoint,'' Cote said.
</P>
<P>
   Mission: Impossible?
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, yes. Cancer is a hit-and-run, guerrilla fighter.
It blends with healthy cells until it can mount an attack in the
form of a tumor or lesion. In many cases, by the time a doctor or
patient notices something out of the ordinary, cancer cells _ too
small to detect by conventional methods _ are on their way to
attack other parts of the body.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer has a voracious appetite and unique abilities to draw on
the body's resources to grow faster than normal cells, making it an
efficient killer that claims roughly half a million American lives
every year.
</P>
<P>
   But those same unique traits may also be its Achilles' heel.
</P>
<P>
   Southern California cancer hunters like Cote are refining
methods to spot those differences and shed some light on the
elusive disease. The scientists say that seeing cancer is crucial
in designing more effective treatments and, hopefully, another step
toward finding a cure.
</P>
<P>
   Using complex molecular probes designed to seek out traits
specific to cancer, Cote and his associates at USC actually have
been able to color cancer cells in bone marrow and lymph node
samples.
</P>
<P>
   It's a lot like flipping on a light switch inside the invading
cells. A slide that once appeared to show only a field of healthy
cells suddenly reveals a string of cancer cells on the move, a
metastasis. Cote believes the cells are scouting sites to begin a
new assault on the body.
</P>
<P>
   The research is currently being evaluated in a multicenter
clinical trial, but the implications are profound for patients. For
example, most women with breast cancer undergo unpleasant
chemotherapy after surgical removal of a tumor even though as many
as 70 percent don't really need it. The problem: There is no
effective way to tell which women still have cancer lurking in
their bodies and which don't. Cote hopes his research will provide
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patients who have these cells in their bone marrow or lymph
nodes are at significantly greater risk for developing overt
metastatic disease than are the patients who do not have these
cells,'' Cote said. ``The tumor that has spread is the tumor that
is going to kill the patient, so the consequences are profound. And
the economic consequences are also quite profound because right
now, basically, everyone is treated.''
</P>
<P>
   It's intriguing news, but like many promising cancer studies,
the medical profession demands solid proof before it embraces the
concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very exciting, but it's been a long road,'' Cote said of
his 14-year pursuit of occult metastases. ``It seems to be a very
straightforward concept, but it's taken many, many years for it to
gain even a modest level of acceptance. It represents a
fundamentally different way to look at a cancer patient, and
there's always a natural resistance to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Conti is familiar with that resistance. As director of
USC's positron emission tomography (PET) lab, Conti works with one
of the most promising and powerful diagnostic tools in the fight
against cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But the machine is just now being accepted by health insurers
despite the fact it's been around for more than a decade. (It was
invented in 1973 at Washington University in St. Louis by Dr.
Michael Phelps and his colleagues.)
</P>
<P>
   Conti said the use of the machine has been clouded by regulatory
red tape and resistance from insurance companies because of its
cost: $2,000 per scan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only in the last year or two it's starting to take hold,
but we've been fighting this battle for over a decade,'' Conti
said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike X-rays and computed tomography (CT) scans that take
pictures of the body's anatomy, PET scans peer into the body's
metabolism. PET scans take advantage of cancer's voracious appetite
for glucose, the body's fuel. Radiologists inject a patient with a
glucoselike substance tagged with a radioactive tracer. Since
tumors take in more glucose than healthy cells, they also suck up
the tracer, which shows up on the PET scan.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which uses the body's
hydrogen atoms to create detailed internal images, PET often can
differentiate between scar tissue and tumors more effectively,
Conti said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been able to see a lot more disease,'' Conti said.
``It's opened up a lot more opportunities in terms of diagnosing
the stage of the disease and monitoring the effectiveness of
therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   That can be a mixed blessing. Take the case of a 71-year-old man
with metastatic melanoma. The disease was discovered first in his
left shoulder; CT and bone scans later revealed the disease near
his spine and in his leg.
</P>
<P>
   But a PET scan revealed cancer lesions throughout his body _ a
fatal diagnosis. Surgeons canceled a planned amputation of his leg,
where they originally thought most of the cancer was concentrated;
the surgery would not have saved him. It's grim news, Conti admits,
but it also allowed the man to spend the remainder of his life with
his family instead of recovering from a traumatic and pointless
surgery. And, on a more commercial level, his insurance company
saved thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side, PET scans can help doctors plan the amount
of chemotherapy to give a patient, based on the rate the cancer has
spread.
</P>
<P>
   PET also promises to help researchers evaluate gene therapy, a
potentially exciting cancer treatment that is just now being
evaluated in humans.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Harvey Herschman, a molecular biologist at the University of
California, Los Angeles, is refining a method that will track genes
that have been modified by scientists to fix a variety of maladies
_ from cancer to cystic fibrosis.
</P>
<P>
   For example, so-called therapeutic genes may one day be used to
suppress or shut down cancer genes before they start working
(called expression), replace bad genes with improved genes, or even
kick the body's immune response to cancer into overdrive.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, just as cancer is tough to see inside the body,
gene therapy pioneers have no idea where their treatment goes and
how _ or even if _ it's working once it enters the body.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any way to measure that,'' Herschman said.
``Essentially, all you can do is ask if the patient is getting any
better. So what we've done is develop techniques where we link the
therapeutic gene to a gene whose expression we can measure with
PET. We can give a positron-labeled compound that gets taken up
only in the tissue where our reporter gene is being expressed, so
if it is on in the liver, then you figure the therapeutic gene must
also be on in the liver.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like a molecular LoJack,'' he said, comparing the
therapy to the satellite tracking system used to track stolen cars.
</P>
<P>
   If color-coding cancer cells or tracking tumors with a PET scan
doesn't lead to a cure for cancer, another breakthrough area could
lie in thermal imaging.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology is similar to what we saw in the Gulf War and
on what police use on those 911 shows to look for a suspect behind
a bush,'' said Dr. Yuri Parisky, a USC radiologist.
</P>
<P>
   Parisky is testing thermal imaging as a method to detect breast
cancer as compared to a benign lesion. Again, it's a promising
hypothesis that is just now entering the human testing stage.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer tumors seem to give off more heat than healthy cells.
Parisky and his colleagues aren't exactly sure why, but they think
it could be related to cancer's unique ability to recruit blood
vessels that help it grow and form a sort of scaffolding for the
tumor or lesion to spread. Since more blood is going to that area,
there should be more heat.
</P>
<P>
   Another theory: Cancer's higher metabolism and turnover rate
generates more heat.
</P>
<P>
   Thermal images peer down into the cellular level. Researchers
use a sophisticated computer program to locate the hot _ or
malignant _ cells.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Parisky said, analysis of thermal images showed that 40
percent of the patients in his study could have been spared a
painful biopsy to check out a suspicious mass detected in a
mammogram. He hopes to improve those odds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done a hundred or so patients with very promising
results,'' Parisky said. ``We'll never be more accurate than a
biopsy, but in the patients we did, it correctly identified 96 to
97 percent of the cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   The only cancerous incident it missed was a DCIS (ductal
carcinoma in situ, a less invasive form of breast cancer) measuring
about 1/10th of an inch, and refinements in the detection method
may one day eliminate those oversights. ``Forty percent of the
women in our study wouldn't have had to go into surgery,'' Parisky
said. ``That's our starting point and we're going to do better.'' &QL;

parents interactively teach practical life lessons to their kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Safe! in the Water'' presents important safety information
in a way that is so entertaining, children will want to hear it
again and again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids can start learning basic water safety much earlier than
many people think,'' says author Wendy Gordon. ``By empowering
children with water safety skills, you could easily save a child's
life this summer.''
</P>
<P>
   This book is the fourth in the series, which has helped kids
deal with imaginary monsters, taught them what to do if they get
lost and prepared them for a new baby in the family.
</P>
<P>
   The series is available at area bookstores. Workbooks designed

NFL TRAINING BEGINS, AND NOT A MOMENT TOO SOON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY RATTO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The National Football League's 31 training camps
begin this week, and though this seems an odd thing to claim given
the downright Stalinist oppressiveness that is training camp, it
can't happen a moment too soon.
</P>
<P>
   Especially here in the San Francisco Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   The last bit of offseason argy-bargy happens Monday when Terrell
Owens actually signs his shiny new contract with the San Francisco
49ers. The seven-year (give or take), $30 million (give or take)
deal makes Owens a major player in the 49ers' future, a future that
will eventually stop including Steve Young and Jerry Rice, or as
49ers fans call it, The Unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   Owens' signing ends a tumultuous and even baffling offseason for
these two little concerns, one that frankly lasted way too long,
produced way too much noise and less actual substance than it
seems. You know this if you have watched the moss grow up your legs
waiting for the 49ers ownership situation to be settled.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the biggest news from the left side of the big trench
was (and is) the disposition of Eddie DeBartolo, Gambling Man.
Having placed himself at the less than tender disposals of his
sister Denise York and his commissioner Paul Tagliabue, DeBartolo
is slowly but surely being squeezed out of the business, although
he continues through his representatives to do cold war with his
sister and the commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   A judge is tapping his feet impatiently waiting for the sides to
come to some agreement on the family fortune.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, nothing is happening there, which means that the
sight of large padded athletes sweating like stevedores through
searing two-a-days is downright welcome. Anything beats another
grinding episode of ``The D-Barts At Peace And War.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers, after all, are trying to make the longest era of
uninterrupted success (18 years and counting) last a bit longer,
and though we all enjoy watching the sibling rivalry boil over as a
matter of gruesome entertainment, it doesn't really advance the
ball much, if you get the drift.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the offseason was about finding football amid the
mess. Garrison Hearst's leg is dying, except that it isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Phillips is coming, except that he isn't. Owens is
testing the market, except that he didn't. And of course, there
were occasional Bill Walsh sightings, just to keep the pot a'boil.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, when the veterans slog their way onto the field, it will
be to the great relief of the Faithful, who endured more offseason
than anyone should be asked to bear.
</P>
<P>
   And what of the Oakland Raiders? All they did was wave the flag
of the city and county of Los Angeles now and then, just to see who
was paying attention. As it turned out, nobody did, perhaps because
nobody has the stomach to lay in front of the moving vans in case
Al Davis gets his three-year itch for the third year in a row.
</P>
<P>
   The Eyepatch Kids, though, were downright hyperactive in
remaking their team for the fourth consecutive year. Jeff George
was shrink-wrapped, tossed into a box with Styrofoam peanuts,
sealed and shipped out with the Japanese tide, all rather than pay
him the last three years of his cream-filled contract. Coach Jon
Gruden cast his lot with the more modestly appointed but presumably
more receptive Rich Gannon, and then hit the roster with a modified
vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders, you see, are in the fifth year of a five-year plan
that so far has only led them to empty seats and no Januarys. They
no longer talk about oozing talent out of every pore, or of
multiple Super Bowls. They talk now of revamping a desperately
deficient offense, and of overcoming one of the NFL's toughest
schedules to leave the land of the Ravens, Bengals, Saints,
Chargers, Seahawks, Eagles, Redskins, Bears, Rams and Titans _ all
teams that have avoided the postseason for the entire second half
of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Gruden is so eager to test his new theories out that the Raiders
are among the first teams to get down to triple-digit-heat-index
business, along with such uninspiring competition as the Browns,
Colts, Bears, Rams and Chargers.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and the Broncos, if that makes you feel any better.
</P>
<P>
   And it is surely about time. After a long and mostly tedious
offseason, it is time for the fellows to hit those sun-roasted
fields for the energetic head- knocking, heat-prostrating good
times that training camp provides.
</P>
<P>
   And it is time for us to sit in the shade, drink something cool
with our feet in the kiddie pool and watch them. Training camp,
after all, means different things to different people, and since we
endured the offseason, it seems only fair that they endure the
actual exercise part.

CALLING CARD CAN SAVE YOU LONG-DISTANCE COSTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA WEN AND BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Glenn Barry and the hundreds of thousands of people like him
across the United States, it may be time to cut the cord to their
long-distance phone company.
</P>
<P>
   Barry is one of those people who don't make many long-distance
calls. He says he averages about one a month, and some months none
at all. Yet his long-distance bill with AT&AMP;T is going up, not down.
</P>
<P>
   Even when he makes no long-distance calls during a month, he has
to pay a 93-cent universal service fund fee, an 85-cent
presubscribed interexchange carrier charge, and a $3 minimum
payment charge. He ends up paying $4.78, plus taxes, for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Phone companies say they have imposed the minimum monthly fees
to offset the cost of maintaining low-volume accounts, but Barry
says AT&AMP;T has told him his usage is so low that it plans to bill
him only every third month.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're sending me fewer bills and charging me more,'' the
Canton, Mass. resident said. ``I don't like the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not alone. With MCIWorldCom and Sprint imposing
similar-size fees and even higher $5 minimum monthly charges on
many of their calling plans, the relentless rise of long-distance
fees has become the most persistent consumer complaint we hear.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Madden of Boston says he can't believe the federal
government has the audacity to assess a tax on the universal
service fund fees it collects. ``In my mind it's a tax on a tax,''
he said. ``It's outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   What to do? You could sit tight and see if the Federal
Communications Commission does anything about the minimum monthly
charges; the agency recently launched an investigation. You could
transfer to another long-distance carrier that doesn't impose the
charges. Or you could dump your long-distance carrier and find a
way around the monthly fees and minimums.
</P>
<P>
   Dumping your long-distance carrier will take some careful
planning and may involve a bit of work, but it should save you some
money and in the process send a message to AT&AMP;T, MCIWorldCom and
Sprint. As Barry said, ``If enough people do it, maybe they'll take
note and reverse themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   To get rid of your long-distance carrier, you have to call Bell
Atlantic and desubscribe. Bell Atlantic will charge you a one-time
fee of $5 as well as a $1.04 monthly interexchange carrier charge.
</P>
<P>
   Now you need to find a way to make long-distance calls without a
long-distance carrier. We've written in the past about 10-10
dial-around companies and phone-to-phone calls over the Internet
using AT&AMP;T or IDT Corp. of Hackensack, N.J. There is also a third
option: prepaid calling cards, a $2.1 billion business.
</P>
<P>
   Prepaid calling cards are a simple product that vendors have
made needlessly complicated _ a problem exacerbated by the fact
that you often have to buy the card without knowing all the charges
up front.
</P>
<P>
   Cards generally require you to dial an access number, either a
toll-free 800 number or a local number. You then punch in a
personal identification number, or PIN, and the number you are
calling to be connected.
</P>
<P>
   Cards are sold by retailers, gas stations, and convenience
stores, and prices can vary significantly on some cards from store
to store. Finding a particular card can also take some work. You
may have to call customer service and ask for the store nearest
you.
</P>
<P>
   Some things to keep in mind when selecting a calling card:
</P>
<P>
   --Will you be calling from home, on the road, or both? Perhaps
you can use a card with a local access number.
</P>
<P>
   --How much does your card charge for directory assistance?
Without a long-distance carrier you won't automatically have
directory assistance.
</P>
<P>
   --Does the card expire or start imposing monthly charges after a
certain amount of time? Also, can the card be recharged, the
industry term for adding additional minutes?
</P>
<P>
   Our favorites of the cards we surveyed were ConeXus of Brookline
and IDT. IDT, which also offers good phone-to-phone Internet
service, had great international and domestic rates. US calls and
calls to directory assistance cost just 7.9 cents a minute and
calls to London and Mexico City were a rock-bottom 10 cents a
minute.
</P>
<P>
   IDT had three negatives. Retailers carrying the card are hard to
find. In addition, the card carries a 99-cent monthly charge and
can't be recharged.
</P>
<P>
   ConeXus's strength is its low, easy-to-understand rates. It
charges 10 cents a minute for US calls if a local access number is
used, or 19 cents a minute if an 800 number is used. The same
charges apply for directory assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ConeXus minutes don't expire and additional minutes can be added
with a recharge card. Best of all, there are no connection fees, no
monthly fees, no pay-phone charges, and no monthly minimums.

SEN. SMITH HAS A POINT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; -- In the end, after not very much hesitation,
Republican Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire lumbered down the
aisle and voted loyally for the GOP version of minicontrols on
health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   There had been doubt about his vote in some Republican circles
earlier in the day, but I can't imagine why anyone would have
expected him to ditch the party on a big one like health care.
After all, as he himself likes to say, ``I'm the most reliable
Republican vote in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   You could look it up. In a compilation done annually by
Congressional Quarterly, Smith edges Idaho's Larry Craig as the
Republican most likely to do what most Republicans do on any given
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Smith brought this up in the context of his decision to resign
from the GOP and try to run for president on a new party or
third-party ticket. To borrow former Democrat Ronald Reagan's old
line, his party had left him, not the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   And he's right. The party that at least officially went
right-to-life 20 years ago with Reagan, is downplaying that
commitment today when it is not looking for ways to fudge it or
weaken it. The party whose platform has consistently sought the
closing down of serious chunks of the federal government or the
evisceration of others has no intention in practice anymore of
doing either. The party that also has pledged not to permit the
ceding of any American sovereignty to an international organization
routinely does exactly that. And its previously adamant position
against federal controls on gun ownership erodes a little more each
week.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans, myself included, would probably applaud these
shifts. And many conservatives are averting their gaze in the rush
to climb aboard the cash-heavy bandwagon of President-in-waiting
Bush. Meanwhile, many Republican politicians are condemning Smith
for being a renegade and vowing that his career is mortally
self-wounded, and many in both parties are openly mocking his
quixotic quest, complete with its self-comparisons to the Smith
that Jimmy Stewart portrayed as going to Washington 60 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Much of it is crude, even cruel, and quite possibly politically
way off base.
</P>
<P>
   As Smith and other movement conservatives like to say, with good
reason, the Republicans have done just fine when they stuck firmly
to conservative principles (the Reagan victories of 1980 and '84
and the congressional earthquake a decade later). And they have not
done so well when they have tried to soften those principles (the
presidential defeats of 1976, '92, and '96.
</P>
<P>
   To understand why Smith has a serious point (evidenced by the
nodding heads of more prominent conservatives even as they said
they would stick with their party for now), it helps to understand
where this guy comes from.
</P>
<P>
   He comes from the grass roots, where people with strong beliefs,
including the belief that beliefs matter, are most likely to be
found in politics today. Smith was brought up in New Jersey, but he
was formed in the insular world of town life in New Hampshire after
his Navy service, teaching school, coaching sports, and selling a
little real estate.
</P>
<P>
   His formative political experience was doing grunt work for
Barry Goldwater in 1964, but he came to life backing Ronald Reagan.
The second time around for Reagan in 1980, Smith was so energized
that he tried to jump from school board service to Congress from
the state's first district.
</P>
<P>
   That, he says, is when he got his first taste of what George W.
Bush's truly conservative opponents are calling the Republican
establishment. A heavy from Washington came up to see him, trying
to persuade him to quit the race and clear the field for a more
moderate candidate. He refused, lost the primary, won nomination
two years later, and made it here in the Reagan landslide of '84.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't changed; but his party clearly has.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's decision to resign his membership will cost him. He
probably loses any hope of moving up to chair the Senate's
Environment and Public Works Committee after Rhode Island's John
Chaffee retires; he loses party support if he decides to seek
reelection three years hence after a near-defeat in '96.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not how he sees it. This is an activist who has
decided that his party no longer means much of what it says, that
its establishment has become downright hostile to people like him.
</P>
<P>
   And that's why the real question following Smith's decision is
not how many other party figures follow him into disillusionment.
It's how many grass-roots activists decide there is no more cause
worthy of their anonymous toil.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Smith could be the tip of a real iceberg of turmoil on the
right. As usual, he spoke for a lot more conservatives than was
evident last week from the snickering his principled decision
elicited.

   NYC-SEX (New York) _ New York City may be the most diversified,
competitive, high-priced flesh market in the world, especially in
summer. On certain evenings as the streets teem with gym-toned
bodies and attitudes to match you have the sense of a million
sexual fantasies in the naked city converging in one giant
imaginary orgy. Paradoxically, two recent films and an HBO series
suggest that these fantasies may be as isolated from one another as
the thoughts of solitary exiles dreaming away their nights on
lonely desert islands. A critic's notebook by Stephen Holden.

   WASHINGTON _ They had come to the Kennedy estate at Hyannisport
to celebrate a wedding; instead, they found themselves preparing
for a funeral. Once again, at what should have been one of its most
joyous moments, America's premier political family found itself
struck by tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   More than 250 guests, most of them members of the Kennedy clan,
had been expected at Saturday afternoon's wedding in the grounds of
the family compound on the southern shore of Cape Cod. The previous
evening, Ethel Kennedy, widow of the late Senator Robert Kennedy,
had held a bridal dinner for her daughter, Rory.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy, Jr., cousin of the bride and only son of the
assassinated president, had been due to arrive at the estate
Saturday, after spending the night at the island of Martha's
Vineyard. He and his wife, Carolyn, never arrived. The couple had
no children.
</P>
<P>
   When the news first broke Saturday morning that JFK's small
plane was missing off the coast of Long Island, a shudder went
through the East Coast political and media establishment. Could it
really be that the ``curse'' had struck again, felling another
young and promising Kennedy in his prime?
</P>
<P>
   His father, John F. Kennedy, had met his premature death at the
hands of an assassin in Dallas in 1963. His uncle, Robert, who
aspired to follow in his brother's footsteps, was assassinated five
years later.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's news was replete with eerie coincidences. Friday was
the 30th anniversary of an earlier Kennedy tragedy, the death of
Mary-Jo Kopechne at Chappaquiddick, in a car driven by President
Kennedy's brother, Ted.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, too, as ships and helicopters searched the waters
north of Long Island, relatives of the some of the 200 people
killed in the unexplained crash of TWA's flight 800 were gathering
on the island's southern shore to commemorate the third anniversary
of that disaster.
</P>
<P>
   John Kennedy, Jr., who is universally recalled in the U.S. from
the pictures of himself and his sister Caroline as small children
at his father's funeral, shone out in many ways as a laudable
exception in a clan plagued by scandals and rumors of every hue,
from drink, drugs and sex, all the way to allegations of murder
surrounding one young relative.
</P>
<P>
   The last Kennedy to meet an untimely death was Michael, a son of
Robert Kennedy, killed after hitting a tree while skiing in Aspen
in 1997. He had just surfaced from reports _ never denied _ that he
had an illicit affair with an underage babysitter.
</P>
<P>
   JFK Jr. had eschewed the political and public service careers
pursued by so many of his relatives, and _ despite living a glitzy
Manhattan life _ dissociated himself from the fast living of
others.
</P>
<P>
   When the babysitter scandal broke over his cousin Michael, John
used an article in George magazine, his own publishing venture, to
describe his relative as a ``poster boy for bad behavior'' and
remind the ``clan'' that ``of those to whom much is given, much is
expected.''
</P>
<P>
   To that clan, the presumed death of JFK Jr. is not just another
member lost to the ``curse.'' It is the end, in a way, of the JFK
legend. This is how Camelot has ended: in the black waters of the
Atlantic, at night. &QL;

   HYANNISPORT _ So consuming was the worry at the Kennedy compound
in Hyannisport on Saturday that nobody told the catering company
hired to feed the 275 guests at the wedding of Rory Kennedy that
the ceremony had been called off. Their vans arrived at three in
the tense afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But by then, most of the rest of the world knew tragedy had
returned to haunt America's most famous political dynasty as it had
done so many times.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the compound, prayers were being said in desperate and
fading hope for the life of the only son of the late President John
F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Within the walls of what the world came to know as Camelot _ the
Kennedy estate set in a picturesque town of clapperboard homes and
rose hedges on the southern shore of Cape Cod, Mass. _ the clan was
struggling to absorb an almost unthinkable reality.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six hours after the private Piper plane of JFK, Jr.
vanished from radar screens off the island of Martha's Vineyard, no
trace of him, his wife, Carolyn Bessette, or her sister, Lauren
Bessette, had been found.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Kennedy, his wife and her sister had been heading
here for a wedding deepens the agony.
</P>
<P>
   Rory Kennedy is a daughter of the late Robert Kennedy _ her
mother, Ethel, was pregnant with her when RFK was shot to death in
California in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen months ago she cradled her dying brother Michael in her
arms after a skiing accident at Aspen, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, her wedding was postponed because of the presumed
death of her cousin. All the clan gathered here on Saturday for her
marriage to Mark Bailey, a book and film critic from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Many guests were visiting the tiny John F. Kennedy Museum on
Main Street on Saturday, when Pearl Guba, its manager made a grim
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were preparing to go to the wedding, some of them from
Ireland, and they were totally shocked when we told them,'' he
said. ``It's a good thing John's mother, Jackie, died first. She
was so fond of her son.''
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday, many of the guests in the compound, a main beachside
house and several small cottages, had slipped discreetly away,
leaving a core of family members. They included Senator Edward
Kennedy, 67, the only principal member of the Kennedy cast to make
it past middle age.
</P>
<P>
   And there were three priests who had come to Cap Cod to bless
the wedding vows. Just 19 months ago the same priests had attended
the funeral of Michael Kennedy, JFK's cousin, killed in Aspen on
New Year's Eve 1997.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, a brief mass was said on the steps of the main
house, overlooking a huge sweeping lawn, with 50 friends and
family. In the streets of Hyannisport, yellow ribbons were wound
around trees, tied by neighbors sharing in the grief and worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the family could use some hope,'' said Melissa
Lewandowski, who put up one of the bows. ``If they saw a yellow
ribbon, they would know that the community is hoping with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The people of Hyannisport still remember when the compound was
an oasis of joy. In an earlier era, it was the gathering point for
family members to summer parties and days by the sea. But these
days, grief more often brings this clan together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so sad,'' said Janice Beechum, a local resident. ``The
only time everybody comes down here now is when there is a Kennedy
tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   For the many children brought along for the cancelled wedding
the somber mood was too hard to comprehend. At midafternoon on
Saturday, a kite-flying party strayed on to the lawn. Later, RFK,
Jr., another cousin of John's, was seen navigating a rocky
breakwater on the beach with his small son on his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of children running around, which always seems
to change the atmosphere,'' said Brian O'Connor, a family
spokesman. ``People are happy to see one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Journalists and TV crews from around the world were once more
pressed up against police fences on the streets from the compound
Sunday, waiting for word from a family that has become so practiced
in dealing with loss.
</P>
<P>
   And family members are waiting for the U.S. Coast Guard to say
they had turned from search and rescue to accident investigation.
Then the family will have to prepare for yet another journey into
grief, and more funerals. &QL;

   HYANNISPORT _ So consuming was the worry at the Kennedy compound
in Hyannisport on Saturday that nobody told the catering company
hired to feed the 275 guests at the wedding of Rory Kennedy that
the ceremony had been called off. Their vans arrived at three in
the tense afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But by then, most of the rest of the world knew tragedy had
returned to haunt America's most famous political dynasty as it had
done so many times.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the compound, prayers were being said in desperate and
fading hope for the life of the only son of the late President John
F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Within the walls of what the world came to know as Camelot _ the
Kennedy estate set in a picturesque town of clapperboard homes and
rose hedges on the southern shore of Cape Cod, Mass. _ the clan was
struggling to absorb an almost unthinkable reality.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six hours after the private Piper plane of JFK, Jr.
vanished from radar screens off the island of Martha's Vineyard, no
trace of him, his wife, Carolyn Bessette, or her sister, Lauren
Bessette, had been found.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Kennedy, his wife and her sister had been heading
here for a wedding deepens the agony.
</P>
<P>
   Rory Kennedy is a daughter of the late Robert Kennedy _ her
mother, Ethel, was pregnant with her when RFK was shot to death in
California in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen months ago she cradled her dying brother Michael in her
arms after a skiing accident at Aspen, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, her wedding was postponed because of the presumed
death of her cousin. All the clan gathered here on Saturday for her
marriage to Mark Bailey, a book and film critic from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Many guests were visiting the tiny John F. Kennedy Museum on
Main Street on Saturday, when Pearl Guba, its manager made a grim
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were preparing to go to the wedding, some of them from
Ireland, and they were totally shocked when we told them,'' he
said. ``It's a good thing John's mother, Jackie, died first. She
was so fond of her son.''
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday, many of the guests in the compound, a main beachside
house and several small cottages, had slipped discreetly away,
leaving a core of family members. They included Senator Edward
Kennedy, 67, the only principal member of the Kennedy cast to make
it past middle age.
</P>
<P>
   And there were three priests who had come to Cap Cod to bless
the wedding vows. Just 19 months ago the same priests had attended
the funeral of Michael Kennedy, JFK's cousin, killed in Aspen on
New Year's Eve 1997.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, a brief mass was said on the steps of the main
house, overlooking a huge sweeping lawn, with 50 friends and
family. In the streets of Hyannisport, yellow ribbons were wound
around trees, tied by neighbors sharing in the grief and worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the family could use some hope,'' said Melissa
Lewandowski, who put up one of the bows. ``If they saw a yellow
ribbon, they would know that the community is hoping with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The people of Hyannisport still remember when the compound was
an oasis of joy. In an earlier era, it was the gathering point for
family members to summer parties and days by the sea. But these
days, grief more often brings this clan together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so sad,'' said Janice Beechum, a local resident. ``The
only time everybody comes down here now is when there is a Kennedy
tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   For the many children brought along for the cancelled wedding
the somber mood was too hard to comprehend. At midafternoon on
Saturday, a kite-flying party strayed on to the lawn. Later, RFK,
Jr., another cousin of John's, was seen navigating a rocky
breakwater on the beach with his small son on his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of children running around, which always seems
to change the atmosphere,'' said Brian O'Connor, a family
spokesman. ``People are happy to see one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Journalists and TV crews from around the world were once more
pressed up against police fences on the streets from the compound
Sunday, waiting for word from a family that has become so practiced
in dealing with loss.
</P>
<P>
   And family members are waiting for the U.S. Coast Guard to say
they had turned from search and rescue to accident investigation.
Then the family will have to prepare for yet another journey into
grief, and more funerals. &QL;

   MARTHA'S VINEYARD _ Square-jawed in his state ranger's hat,
Captain Robert Bird was still not ready to concede what the rest of
America had already, reluctantly, concluded _ that 36 hours after
it vanished from radar screen 19 miles off Martha's Vineyard, the
small Piper plane belonging to John F. Kennedy, Jr. was unlikely to
surrender any survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is still classified as a search and rescue operation,''
he said without emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, there was still room for hope Sunday. In the summer
months, someone from that plane _ JFK himself, his wife Carolyn
Bessette, and her sister, Lauren Bessette _ might still have been
breathing in those Atlantic waters.
</P>
<P>
   But common sense, and the belongings that had already washed up
on a beach of fine sand on the island's westernmost edge, told a
different tale. JFK, Jr. was surely dead.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, disbelief and grief have struck this land as it takes its
summer vacations _ just as it did Britain when the Princess of
Wales died in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   JFK was not royalty, but he was surely a prince. The only
surviving son of the late President John F. Kennedy, he was also
America's favorite son: impossibly good looking, very rich and a
perennial of gossip headlines and magazine covers.
</P>
<P>
   Even his death _ apparent death _ was more poignant and more
strange than the most fertile of tabloid imaginations could have
mustered.
</P>
<P>
   He and the beautiful wife he married in 1996 were heading for
Massachusetts for a wedding at the place where the American version
of Camelot was born, the Kennedy Compound at Hyannisport on Cape
Cod.
</P>
<P>
   To be wed was Rory Kennedy, the daughter of the late Robert F.
Kennedy, who just 19 months ago watched as her brother, Michael,
died in her arms on a ski slope in Aspen.
</P>
<P>
   And, as everyone on Martha's Vineyard wanted to remind you,
Sunday was the 30th anniversary of the incident on Chappaquiddick
that spawned the first Kennedy scandal, when a car driven by Edward
Kennedy plunged off a bridge killing his passenger, Mary Jo
Kopechne.
</P>
<P>
   This is no ordinary curse that the Kennedys are suffering, it is
a curse with a gruesome sense of historical neatness.
</P>
<P>
   And then there were those pieces of flotsam found by swimmers
and sunbathers just after lunchtime on Saturday: a canvas suitcase
bearing the Morgan Stanley business card of Lauren, a cosmetic bag,
a prescription bottle with the name Carolyn Bessette on the label,
a plane seat, a piece of a strut and the rubber covering from a
pedal.
</P>
<P>
   They all washed up on Philbins Beach _ less than two miles from
the Martha's Vineyard house that JFK inherited from his mother,
Jackie, after she died in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   It was the bag they spotted first, bobbing in the slight summer
swell. Damon Seligson, 30, from Boston swam out to fetch it. ``We
were standing on the beach, enjoying the day _ a bunch of us were
watching the waves and saw what looked like luggage floating in the
water,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aware that the plane had gone missing, he feared the worst. ``My
heart was pounding. I almost passed out.'' When he retrieved it,
the bag was wet but intact, Lauren's business card still inserted
in a sewn-on pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``We opened it to peek in and saw women's clothing, a makeup bag
and hair dryer. It was a terrible sinking feeling. I felt my heart
burst out of my chest. It was just terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   The search Sunday concentrated in an area of ocean between the
western shore of the Vineyard and tiny No Man's Island 3.5 miles
away. Taking part were ships and aircraft of the U.S. Coast Guard
and the civil air patrol. Above circled a U.S. Air Force C-130
acting as an air traffic control center.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a small plane in a large expanse of water that may
have broken into a thousand pieces. And although the sandy seabed
is only about 300 feet deep _ not too far for divers to venture _
there are areas of large boulder fields that could shield any
wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   And there is something else few wanted to talk about Sunday:
these are waters favored during the summer by sharks.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, across just 20 miles of water at Hyannisport on
Cape Cod, the Kennedy family can only wait, the world's press
thronging a few yards from the compound's entrance.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend that had meant to be one of joy for a young couple
getting married had not just been ruined, it had become a rehearsal
for a labor the family knows too well _ the labor of tragic loss.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the wedding guests were gone by Sunday, leaving behind
only members of the family and a billowing but empty white marquee.
</P>
<P>
   They were, one acquaintance said, holding themselves together.
``It's a kind of stoic optimism,'' he said. ``This is a family that
has been through a lot. You move forward by hope.'' But hope seems
forlorn.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Fallen Son,'' said the front page of the Cape Cod Times. In
New York there were 25 pages of JFK in the Post, 24 pages in the
Daily News. Only Diana could beat him on the newsstand.
</P>
<P>
   Now in death, his story resonates with the family tragedies that
came before _ in its sadness and the shock it delivers to America. &QL;

   To be wed was Rory Kennedy, the daughter of the late Robert F.
Kennedy, who just 19 months ago watched as her brother, Michael,
died in her arms on a ski slope in Aspen.
</P>
<P>
   And, as everyone on Martha's Vineyard wanted to remind you,
Sunday was the 30th anniversary of the incident on Chappaquiddick
that spawned the first Kennedy scandal, when a car driven by Edward
Kennedy plunged off a bridge killing his passenger, Mary Jo
Kopechne.
</P>
<P>
   This is no ordinary curse that the Kennedys are suffering, it is
a curse with a gruesome sense of historical neatness.
</P>
<P>
   And then there were those pieces of flotsam found by swimmers
and sunbathers just after lunchtime on Saturday: a canvas suitcase
bearing the Morgan Stanley business card of Lauren, a cosmetic bag,
a prescription bottle with the name Carolyn Bessette on the label,
a plane seat, a piece of a strut and the rubber covering from a
pedal.
</P>
<P>
   They all washed up on Philbins Beach _ less than two miles from
the Martha's Vineyard house that JFK inherited from his mother,
Jackie, after she died in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   It was the bag they spotted first, bobbing in the slight summer
swell. Damon Seligson, 30, from Boston swam out to fetch it. ``We
were standing on the beach, enjoying the day _ a bunch of us were
watching the waves and saw what looked like luggage floating in the
water,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aware that the plane had gone missing, he feared the worst. ``My
heart was pounding. I almost passed out.'' When he retrieved it,
the bag was wet but intact, Lauren's business card still inserted
in a sewn-on pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``We opened it to peek in and saw women's clothing, a makeup bag
and hair dryer. It was a terrible sinking feeling. I felt my heart
burst out of my chest. It was just terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   The search Sunday concentrated in an area of ocean between the
western shore of the Vineyard and tiny No Man's Island 3.5 miles
away. Taking part were ships and aircraft of the U.S. Coast Guard
and the civil air patrol. Above circled a U.S. Air Force C-130
acting as an air traffic control center.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a small plane in a large expanse of water that may
have broken into a thousand pieces. And although the sandy seabed
is only about 300 feet deep _ not too far for divers to venture _
there are areas of large boulder fields that could shield any
wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   And there is something else few wanted to talk about Sunday:
these are waters favored during the summer by sharks.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, across just 20 miles of water at Hyannisport on
Cape Cod, the Kennedy family can only wait, the world's press
thronging a few yards from the compound's entrance.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend that had meant to be one of joy for a young couple
getting married had not just been ruined, it had become a rehearsal
for a labor the family knows too well _ the labor of tragic loss.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the wedding guests were gone by Sunday, leaving behind
only members of the family and a billowing but empty white marquee.
</P>
<P>
   They were, one acquaintance said, holding themselves together.
``It's a kind of stoic optimism,'' he said. ``This is a family that
has been through a lot. You move forward by hope.'' But hope seems
forlorn.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Fallen Son,'' said the front page of the Cape Cod Times. In
New York there were 25 pages of JFK in the Post, 24 pages in the
Daily News. Only Diana could beat him on the newsstand.
</P>
<P>
   Now in death, his story resonates with the family tragedies that
came before _ in its sadness and the shock it delivers to America. &QL;

 c.1999 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can a revolution, as rigorous and all-encompassing as Iran's, be
civilized step by step?
</P>
<P>
   President Muhammad Khatami, with his ambition to impose a
``civil society'' on the country's Islamic framework, has been
endeavoring to do just that. All too often his progress is two
steps back for each one forward.
</P>
<P>
   His is undoubtedly a government of good intentions. But he is
trapped between the frustrated, impatient young _ 60 percent of
today's Iranians were toddlers or not yet born at the time of the
1979 Islamic takeover _ who urge him to race ahead, and
conservative clerical overlords who wait watchfully to trip him up,
and more often than not succeed in doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Iran's audacious students battling in the streets
against the authorities in the most open act of political defiance
since the earliest years of the Islamic republic, the future of
Khatami's gentle reforms are in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The students' challenge began as a limited protest against a law
that set out to reverse the relative press freedom that is the
reformist government's one tangible achievement.
</P>
<P>
   This was one reverse too far: Iran's young cherish a packet of
grievances, ranging from the acute shortage of jobs to the social
restrictions that ban most boy-and-girl outings.
</P>
<P>
   Restrictive though it is, the system allows discussion of these
complaints, and many niggling rules have been quietly eased since
Khatami took over.
</P>
<P>
   But after the police and their allies, the Islamist bully-boy
militia, raided dormitories in Tehran University, killing at least
one student and probably more, the shout for change began to
penetrate out-of-bounds areas.
</P>
<P>
   The students started to call for fundamental reforms,
questioning the legitimacy of clerical control. They even, albeit
tentatively, challenged the sacrosanct heart of Iran's Islamist
edifice, the ultimate authority of the ``supreme leader.''
</P>
<P>
   So bold an assault on their bastions of power was intolerable to
the clerics, not excluding Khatami, who is scrupulous about
operating within the system.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, however different their visions of an Islamic society,
the president has been careful to work closely with Ali Khamenei,
the ayatollah who succeeded Khomeini as supreme leader in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to calm the hotheads, he could do little but plead for
the law to be respected. The students were told to stay off the
streets, an order many of them disobeyed. The result on Tuesday,
the sixth day of protest, was chaos in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   Students rampaged through the city, burning tires and throwing
stones. They were met by the police, shooting in the air and firing
tear gas, plus the ever-present and far less temperate vigilantes.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ayatollah Khamenei and Khatami denounced the rioters,
claiming they had little to do with the original student protest:
the ayatollah added chillingly that the Basij, the Islamic militia,
had his full support ``to intimidate and crush'' the enemies.
</P>
<P>
   The latest crackdown is by no means the first suppression of
civilian protest in the past ten years. It is, however, the first
time that the security services have taken on any group as
articulate and well-connected as the country's students.
</P>
<P>
   Iranian students, who now number over a million, showed their
muscle 20 years ago when their widespread demonstrations inside
Iran, and their energetic organizations outside, helped bring down
the shah and his secular regime.
</P>
<P>
   Could they bring down the Islamic regime? History is unlikely to
repeat itself quite like that. Iran's pre-revolutionary students
(many of whom were communist rather than Islamist or democratic)
were far better organized than the current lot.
</P>
<P>
   They had the determined aim of getting rid of the shah, his
corrupt entourage and his western ways and buddies. They were in
tune with many sections of the population, alienated from the shah
and his security apparatus.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, by the late 1970s, the shah's support had crumbled. He
had no solid base fighting to keep him in power.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, today's protesting students may dislike the firm
clerical framework of their state _ which shows no sign of
crumbling _ but most of them still support a government that they
enthusiastically helped to bring about through their votes for
Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   Their aims, therefore, are diffuse. They want many of the same
things that the president and his reformist ministers are
struggling for: more jobs, fewer petty rules, greater freedom of
expression, less interference with the electoral system and better
relations with the West, above all the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Since they share many of its goals, their aim is not to

   The hope must be that, out of this week's incidents, he and the

genuine freedom and democracy. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Can a revolution, as rigorous and all-encompassing as Iran's, be
civilized step by step?
</P>
<P>
   President Muhammad Khatami, with his ambition to impose a
``civil society'' on the country's Islamic framework, has been
endeavoring to do just that. All too often his progress is two
steps back for each one forward.
</P>
<P>
   His is undoubtedly a government of good intentions. But he is
trapped between the frustrated, impatient young _ 60 percent of
today's Iranians were toddlers or not yet born at the time of the
1979 Islamic takeover _ who urge him to race ahead, and
conservative clerical overlords who wait watchfully to trip him up,
and more often than not succeed in doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Iran's audacious students battling in the streets
against the authorities in the most open act of political defiance
since the earliest years of the Islamic republic, the future of
Khatami's gentle reforms are in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The students' challenge began as a limited protest against a law
that set out to reverse the relative press freedom that is the
reformist government's one tangible achievement.
</P>
<P>
   This was one reverse too far: Iran's young cherish a packet of
grievances, ranging from the acute shortage of jobs to the social
restrictions that ban most boy-and-girl outings.
</P>
<P>
   Restrictive though it is, the system allows discussion of these
complaints, and many niggling rules have been quietly eased since
Khatami took over.
</P>
<P>
   But after the police and their allies, the Islamist bully-boy
militia, raided dormitories in Tehran University, killing at least
one student and probably more, the shout for change began to
penetrate out-of-bounds areas.
</P>
<P>
   The students started to call for fundamental reforms,
questioning the legitimacy of clerical control. They even, albeit
tentatively, challenged the sacrosanct heart of Iran's Islamist
edifice, the ultimate authority of the ``supreme leader.''
</P>
<P>
   So bold an assault on their bastions of power was intolerable to
the clerics, not excluding Khatami, who is scrupulous about
operating within the system.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, however different their visions of an Islamic society,
the president has been careful to work closely with Ali Khamenei,
the ayatollah who succeeded Khomeini as supreme leader in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to calm the hotheads, he could do little but plead for
the law to be respected. The students were told to stay off the
streets, an order many of them disobeyed. The result on Tuesday,
the sixth day of protest, was chaos in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   Students rampaged through the city, burning tires and throwing
stones. They were met by the police, shooting in the air and firing
tear gas, plus the ever-present and far less temperate vigilantes.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ayatollah Khamenei and Khatami denounced the rioters,
claiming they had little to do with the original student protest:
the ayatollah added chillingly that the Basij, the Islamic militia,
had his full support ``to intimidate and crush'' the enemies.
</P>
<P>
   The latest crackdown is by no means the first suppression of
civilian protest in the past ten years. It is, however, the first
time that the security services have taken on any group as
articulate and well-connected as the country's students.
</P>
<P>
   Iranian students, who now number over a million, showed their
muscle 20 years ago when their widespread demonstrations inside
Iran, and their energetic organizations outside, helped bring down
the shah and his secular regime.
</P>
<P>
   Could they bring down the Islamic regime? History is unlikely to
repeat itself quite like that. Iran's pre-revolutionary students
(many of whom were communist rather than Islamist or democratic)
were far better organized than the current lot.
</P>
<P>
   They had the determined aim of getting rid of the shah, his
corrupt entourage and his western ways and buddies. They were in
tune with many sections of the population, alienated from the shah
and his security apparatus.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, by the late 1970s, the shah's support had crumbled. He
had no solid base fighting to keep him in power.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, today's protesting students may dislike the firm
clerical framework of their state _ which shows no sign of
crumbling _ but most of them still support a government that they
enthusiastically helped to bring about through their votes for
Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   Their aims, therefore, are diffuse. They want many of the same
things that the president and his reformist ministers are
struggling for: more jobs, fewer petty rules, greater freedom of
expression, less interference with the electoral system and better
relations with the West, above all the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Since they share many of its goals, their aim is not to
undermine, let alone get rid of, the government. Rather, they would
like to put fire in its belly.
</P>
<P>
   Will they succeed? The current protests share one quality with
the earlier ones: their unpredictability. The results in 1979 were
not what many of the protesters expected.
</P>
<P>
   As a new biography of Khomeini relates, the revolution was
hijacked by the ayatollah's unwavering determination to set up a
strict clerical state: revolutionaries with other aims found
themselves pushed aside.
</P>
<P>
   The students now fighting to get Khatami to accelerate change
could inadvertently bring about a conservative backlash that sweeps
away the power of a man who, despite all his caution, is suspected
by many clerical diehards of being an Iranian Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
   The hope must be that, out of this week's incidents, he and the
students will both prevail, promoting reform that opens Iran to
genuine freedom and democracy. &QL;

<P>
   Big, deep, sophisticated, flexible: America's financial markets
are the envy of the world. For how much longer?
</P>
<P>
   Consider the mighty Treasury-bond market. This is the world's
biggest thanks mainly to the government's persistent inability to
balance the books. But now the Treasury is raking in huge
surpluses; President Bill Clinton has even claimed that the
government might pay off its debt by 2015. What on earth would bond
arbitrageurs do then?
</P>
<P>
   Thank heavens, there are plenty of reasons to doubt Clinton's
forecast. As other countries have found, surpluses have a magical
way of disappearing as soon as the politicians get to know about
them.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if America's Treasury-bond market will not, after all,
disappear, might its stock market?
</P>
<P>
   America seems to be running out of shares. That may seem
surprising: what about all those extravagantly priced Internet
offers? They are small beer. Taken as a whole, American companies
are now buying back as much as 2 percent of their outstanding
equity every year.
</P>
<P>
   If that trend persists, in 50 years' time there would be
two-thirds fewer shares than there are now; and 100 years from now,
corporate America would be financed almost entirely by debt.
</P>
<P>
   A century may be rather longer than the average investor's time
horizon. However, the trend matters today.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, corporate America is hugely profitable: the
latest quarterly earnings reports, starting this week, will
probably be pretty good. But they should be treated with caution.
</P>
<P>
   If American companies continue to buy back their own shares,
anything that uses them as a denominator _ such as
earnings-per-share, or return on equity _ will automatically rise,
even if underlying profits are unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, buying back shares by issuing more debt means that
corporate America is becoming ever more exposed to risk.
</P>
<P>
   Their ability to borrow so much has a lot to do with lenders'
astonishingly generous attitudes to companies with apparently
overextended balance sheets. Yet even this does not solve the
fundamental riddle: why would companies buy something that is as
dear just now as their own shares?
</P>
<P>
   With equity as cheap to raise as it is, and interest rates
threatening to rise, it might make more sense to be selling shares
rather than buying them.
</P>
<P>
   The answer to the riddle might lie in an innovation that has
often been touted as a savior of modern American capitalism, but
could yet turn out to be a false prophet: share options.
</P>
<P>
   These were supposed to align the interests of companies'
managers with those of shareholders by concentrating managers'
minds on profitability. They have not quite worked out that way.
Instead, many bosses have responded, entirely rationally, by trying
to sweat as much return in as short a time as they can manage from
as little equity as possible.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, stock options have created a huge incentive for
firms' managers to borrow in order to buy back equity _ which is
not at all the same as looking after shareholders' long-term
interests.
</P>
<P>
   As well as raising fundamental questions about the ownership of
companies in the long term, corporate America's growing debt raises
concerns about their health in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, inadequate leverage is bad for shareholders, for too
much equity leads to meager returns. But too little equity could
also threaten a company's solvency when the economy sours.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt America's ever-sophisticated financial markets will be
ready to pick up the pieces. &QL;

<P>
   When Arizona became a state in 1912, the first man it sent to
the United States Senate was a loquacious cowboy called Henry
Fountain Ashurst. In his first address to the Senate, Ashurst
boasted that Arizona was ``poised to become a veritable paradise.''
</P>
<P>
   Only two things were needed, he said: ``Water, and lots of good
people.'' According to legend, a senator from New England
responded, ``If the gentleman from Arizona will forgive me, that's
all they need in hell.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, it is Arizonans who are having the laugh. Their
state has been a huge success story in the second half of the 20th
century partly because it has honored Ashurst's first criterion for
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   It has built massive dams and irrigation projects, providing
enough water for a rapidly growing population. The 1990s have also
brought a booming high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   Water, people, work: everything seems to be going Arizona's way.
The core of the state's spectacular growth is Phoenix, a capital
city brought to life from the unforgiving desert.
</P>
<P>
   Once home only to agrarian Indian tribes and copper prospectors,
Phoenix is now the fastest-growing city (among cities with a
population of 1 million or more) in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1990s, according to recent Census Bureau data, its
population increased by 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many cities in the east whose population has dropped
during the decade as people have shifted to the suburbs, central
Phoenix has gained 200,000 new residents.
</P>
<P>
   But the suburbs have flourished, too; Mesa, Scottsdale and
Chandler have expanded so rapidly that the whole metropolitan area,
not just the city itself, sets a countrywide record.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors have fed this growth, apart from the general
demographic trend in favor of the southern and western states.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of big high-tech companies such as Motorola, Intel
and Honeywell has lured people in recent years, but long before
that a policy of limited government and few regulations pulled
businessmen into Phoenix. And Arizona recovered from the recession
of the early 1990s more quickly than its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   According to Marc Perry of the Census Bureau, much of the 1990s
migration to Phoenix comes from California, which lingered in
recession longer than the other western states.
</P>
<P>
   The migration to new jobs means that Phoenix's population has
remained relatively young. Retired people account for a much
smaller part of the population growth in Arizona than in other
retirement havens, such as Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The relative youth of Phoenix's newest inhabitants becomes clear
when you drive north from the center of town. Thousands of family
homes, in residential developments with names like Arrowhead Valley
and Citrus Creek, are being built for miles in every direction.
</P>
<P>
   So rapid a growth has inevitably bred controversy. As Phoenix
spreads farther into the desert, some city officials and
environmental groups think the sprawl will become unmanageable.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Bahr of the Sierra Club reckons that ``Phoenix is well on
its way to becoming Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   By some estimates, new construction is cutting into the Sonoran
Desert at the rate of an acre an hour. The ease with which new land
can be developed around Phoenix is partly due to geography: there
are no mountains or big lakes to place natural checks on growth.
</P>
<P>
   A more compelling reason, however, is the fierce anti-regulatory
strain in Arizona politics. The state legislature has shied away
from enforcing guidelines for urban development in the Phoenix
area. On the contrary, it has encouraged it by freeing most
developers from environmental-impact fees.
</P>
<P>
   The state's governor, Jane Hull, has set up a commission to
design regulations for future development, but there are doubts
that it will come up with anything enforceable.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Sierra Club's Bahr pins her hopes on a set of
strict regulations drafted by the club, which will be put to the
voters in November next year.
</P>
<P>
   If the city ever decides to set limits on its growth, it is
unlikely to be because of fears for the environment. There are
millions of untouched desert acres around Phoenix where new suburbs
could easily spring up. Most people think that the current water
system can cope with urban growth far into the future.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their laissez-faire approach to life, Arizonans like the
nature they see around them. One day, the two things will clash.
But not yet, they reckon. &QL;

   BERKELEY _ A street filled with angry protesters, shouts, chants
and songs through the night, the riot squad called in. It sounds
like a 35th birthday party for the Free Speech Movement, but what
is happening these days in Berkeley, the American capital of
protest politics, is quite serious.
</P>
<P>
   The city is embroiled in a dispute about the management of KPFA,
the oldest listener-sponsored radio station in the United States
and long the voice of Berkeley's far left.
</P>
<P>
   Not many years after KPFA was founded, in 1949, by a pacifist
called Lewis Hill, it became the first radio station to broadcast a
reading of Allen Ginsberg's ``Howl.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s it broadcast live coverage of Berkeley's famous
marches and demonstrations, including the Free Speech Movement
sit-ins, Black Panther trials and the battle over People's Park.
</P>
<P>
   It was on a tape first broadcast on KPFA that Patty Hearst, the
kidnapped heiress of the newspaper empire, announced her conversion
to her captors' views and called her parents ``capitalist pigs.''
</P>
<P>
   But KPFA is not its own boss. It is part of a stable of five
major FM stations owned and operated by the Pacifica Radio
Foundation; the others are WBAI in New York City, KPFK in Los
Angeles, WPFW in Washington, and KPFT in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the present row. Last March, Pacifica's executive
director, Lynn Chadwick, refused to renew the contract of Nicole
Sawaya, KPFA's station manager, saying she ``was not a team
player.''
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, KPFA broadcast a report of Sawaya's sacking,
calling it a ``power grab'' by the network. This brought
retribution from Pacifica.
</P>
<P>
   Other KPFA journalists were sacked for discussing the matter,
and on July 13 Dennis Bernstein, the news director, was physically
dragged off the air for mentioning it. It made riveting listening.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the KPFA partisans realize it or not, the problems
facing their favorite radio station are the tip of a very large
iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the Pacifica network has become the only real
``alternative'' network left in American radio. Programs
distributed by National Public Radio, by far the largest network of
listener-supported (or ``public'') radio stations in the country,
have grown increasingly bland.
</P>
<P>
   NPR's most popular show _ after two drive-time news programs _
is ``Car Talk,'' a call-in program featuring two voluble brothers
who dispense in equal parts mechanical and ``relationship'' advice.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the FM and AM radio dials are crowded with
commercial stations, providing a rarely-varying roar of rock,
country &AMP; western, ``oldies,'' talk and rap.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Pacifica's most popular network program is
``Democracy Now!,'' a daily hour-long feature that won an award
earlier this year for its coverage of massacres in oil-rich regions
of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   But if Pacifica's programming has remained defiantly the same,
its potential audience has been changing, especially in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Latinos, Asians and South Americans in the region
has grown markedly, while the white population has declined.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of California's Berkeley campus, white,
middle-class radicals have long since been supplanted by diligent
middle-class students, largely of Asian descent.
</P>
<P>
   All the more bizarre, then, that KPFA _ which has the signal and
the power to reach 6.5 million listeners in the greater Bay Area _
has an audience of about 200,000 who are mostly white, male and
over 50.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Pacifica Radio Foundation, Mary Frances
Berry _ a black woman who marched with Martin Luther King, who also
happens to be the head of the federal Civil Rights Commission _ is
keen to shift Pacifica's focus away from radicalism towards the
interests of ethnic minorities, which also often go unheard.
</P>
<P>
   It would certainly make sense in San Francisco, but others fear
_ rightly _ that the attempt to reach new listeners will inevitably
dilute the one remaining voice of the far left. &QL;

happens to be the head of the federal Civil Rights Commission _ is
keen to shift Pacifica's focus away from radicalism towards the
interests of ethnic minorities, which also often go unheard.
</P>
<P>
   It would certainly make sense in San Francisco, but others fear
_ rightly _ that the attempt to reach new listeners will inevitably
dilute the one remaining voice of the far left. &QL;

   AUSTIN, TEXAS AND WASHINGTON, D.C. _ In his science-fiction
classic ``From Earth to the Moon,'' Jules Verne tells the tale of a
group of American entrepreneurs who had the crazed notion that it
was possible to send humans to the moon.
</P>
<P>
   After working out what size of cannon and how much gunpowder
would be needed to propel the capsule into space, all that remained
was to decide where the launch should occur.
</P>
<P>
   It was narrowed down to either Texas or Florida, inciting a
battle royal between the two states. Texans dismissed Florida as a
``wretched little strip of country''; Florida's representatives
decried Texas as a remote wasteland teeming with Mexican bandits.
</P>
<P>
   More than 130 years after Verne wrote his novel, the arguments
have become a bit more sophisticated and the stakes a bit more
serious in the battle over where to put the future hub of the
American space industry.
</P>
<P>
   Texas and Florida are currently the front-runners among 15
states pitching plans to aerospace manufacturers for futuristic
``spaceports'' in a bid to capture a slice of the burgeoning
commercial satellite market (expected to be worth $120 billion by
2010).
</P>
<P>
   The worldwide demand for Internet and cellular telephone service
has created the need for communications companies around the globe
to get hundreds of satellites into orbit as quickly and cheaply as
possible. The proposed spaceports are seen as one answer.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies are developing space vehicles that could take
off from a domestic spaceport and carry cargo into space with
almost the frequency of a jumbo jet.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the current Space Shuttle, these Reusable Launch Vehicles
(RLVs) would be able to go up and come down entirely under their
own power, making disposable fuel tanks and rocket boosters
unnecessary. The turnaround time between launches would thus be
dramatically cut.
</P>
<P>
   This would be an obvious boon to the commercial space industry,
which is expected to account for roughly 75 percent of all launches
ten years from now, with the government down to a quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The jewel of the proposed RLVs, and the project the competing
states are most eager to land, is Lockheed Martin's VentureStar.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lockheed officials, VentureStar will be able to
take cargo into space at a tenth of the current cost, and could be
ready to fly every two or three days.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to commercial interest in the project, the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has also indicated that
VentureStar could ultimately replace the Space Shuttle and become
the primary courier to the International Space Station.
</P>
<P>
   NASA has put up most of the money for a VentureStar prototype
that will be ready for testing next year. If the tests are
successful, Lockheed will decide where to base the project among
the 15 competing states.
</P>
<P>
   It could begin operating by 2005, though many scientists think
RLVs will not really get off the ground for another 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The interested states have stepped up their efforts to reel in
VentureStar. State officials print glossy proposals and fly
Lockheed officials in helicopters over the proposed spaceport
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Wooing VentureStar has a special urgency for Florida, which has
seen money for Cape Canaveral dry up as companies have begun to buy
launch services from sites outside the country.
</P>
<P>
   According to Edward Ellegood, an official at the Spaceport
Florida Authority, losing VentureStar and other RLV projects could
bring the end of the space industry in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Jeb Bush and the Florida legislature were so alarmed by
the thought that they recently set aside millions of dollars to
improve the state's launch infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   This new influx of money could give Florida a leg up in the
space race, yet Tom Moser of the Texas Aerospace Commission will
not entertain such an idea.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in an office adorned with model spaceships, he argues
that the proposed Texas spaceport would neither depend on federal
money nor require the use of federal air space, two factors he
believes will entice aerospace companies that want to minimize
bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   But other states would like a piece of the action, too. Since
the new RLVs will not discard any equipment after being launched,
it is no longer necessary to send them up from coastal sites.
Landlocked states like Montana, New Mexico and Nevada may also land
spaceport contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Those directing each state's efforts are quick to point out
that, even if they are unsuccessful with Lockheed's VentureStar,
there are several other RLV projects in the works that could give
them a stake in the new space industry.
</P>
<P>
   Kistler Aerospace and Space Access, two of Lockheed's rivals,
are also developing reusable spacecraft and are shopping around for
launch sites.
</P>
<P>
   With 1,700 satellites being prepared for launching over the next
decade, a state does not want to be left out of the multibillion
dollar market. &QL;

   CHICAGO _ While Americans' eyes have been happily fixed on a
rising stock market, another and glummer statistic has been
climbing longer and more steadily: the number of Americans behind
bars.
</P>
<P>
   The population of federal and state prisons and local jails has
climbed from 744,000 in 1985 to nearly 2 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   If present incarceration rates stay constant, the Bureau of
Justice Statistics estimates that 5 percent of Americans will go to
prison at some point in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The states do not slam the door equally. The five states with
the most prisoners per 100,000 people are in the South: Louisiana,
Texas, Oklahoma, Mississippi and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the incarceration rate is 24 percent higher in the South
than in the West, the next highest region, and a whopping 60
percent higher than in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Why are Southerners packing so many more people into prisons? To
begin with, there is more violent crime to be dealt with.
</P>
<P>
   The murder rate in the South is 8.4 per 100,000, compared with
6.8 in the West and 4.8 in the Northeast. And, when a criminal is
caught, he is more likely to see the inside of a jail in the South.
</P>
<P>
   According to the most recent Department of Justice data, 49
percent of convicted felons get prison time in the South compared
with 43 percent elsewhere in the country. The sentences are longer,
too: 84 months on average in the South, 59 months outside it.
</P>
<P>
   But enthusiasm for prisons may be waning. John DiIulio, a former
professor of public policy at Princeton University and one of the
most articulate proponents of the social benefits of locking up
criminals, has begun to argue that 2 million prisoners are enough.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks that spending on imprisonment may crowd out other ways
of reducing crime, such as better policing and drug rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   Even some politicians have become less eager to lock people up.
In South Dakota, where the prison budget has climbed 33 percent
since 1997, legislators recently balked at the governor's proposal
to impose a mandatory 30-day jail sentence for any drug conviction.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Kansas recently imposed a minimum 11.5-year
sentence for a first conviction for methamphetamine manufacturing
and life imprisonment for the second offense.
</P>
<P>
   States that have locked up prisoners and thrown away the key, as
is the case with mandatory life sentences, have not seen their
highest costs yet.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Abadinsky, a professor of criminal justice at St. Xavier
University in Chicago, reckons that the price of keeping inmates
nearly doubles, on average, once they get past 50. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Its designers named Iridium after the 77th element in honor of
the 77 satellites that were to beam signals around the world.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the mobile-telephone network uses only 66 satellites,
but Dysprosium, the 66th element, sounds more like an
antidepressant than a technological marvel. Which is fitting.
</P>
<P>
   On July 14 Iridium's shares tumbled 18 percent, to $6.75, on
news that Motorola, which has already ploughed $1.66 billion into
the venture, has vowed not to invest any more unless other
investors do so too.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year Iridium's shares have fallen by 89 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Little more than nine months since it opened for business, the
world's first mobile satellite-telephone service (MSS), may already
be doomed.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Iridium's failings could tarnish the prospects of two
better-conceived rival services, Globalstar, which will be launched
later this year, and ICO, which will enter the market in August
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Iridium's survival could depend upon whether Motorola's threats
can get its investors, bond-holders and creditors to agree on the
outlines of a financial restructuring before a deadline of August
11.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Iridium was due to make a $90 million bond payment
on July 15, though it has a 30-day grace period. If it misses the
payment or the haggling over restructuring drags on, the company
could file for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Equally critical will be whether the 65 percent cut in the price
of calls, announced at the end of June, has increased the number of
subscribers from 10,000 at the end of March to the revised (though
still modest) target of 27,000 by the end of July.
</P>
<P>
   Iridium is in a bind: investors won't put more money in until
they see that customers are interested, whereas customers won't buy
until they know the company has the financial backing to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Iridium got itself into this mess astonishingly quickly. Were
its estimates of the MSS market _ between 32 million and 45 million
subscribers within ten years _ plain wrong? Or are Iridium's own
failings chiefly responsible?
</P>
<P>
   Iridium's assessment of the market still seems right. Mobile
telephony is going from strength to strength. In the next two
years, the number of subscribers worldwide is expected almost to
double to nearly 600 million.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts, such as Tom Watts of Merrill Lynch, a brokerage, think
the MSS providers should be able to grab about 2.5 percent of that
by offering handsets that will operate as both a land-based
cellular phone and a satellite telephone when cellular service is
unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   ICO's most recent market research, spanning 12 countries and
20,000 interviews, confirms earlier findings that if the price is
right, the demand will be there.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from continent-hopping business executives, niche markets
include long-haul truckers, civil engineers, field scientists,
disaster-relief agencies, news organizations, extractive industries
and geologists.
</P>
<P>
   Satellite telephones should also be useful in shipping and
aviation, as well as in less-developed countries that lack either
modern fixed-wire or wireless telephone infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Iridium has signed up pitifully few subscribers. Technology
gremlins are not to blame, despite the launch being delayed a month
or two by some software problems. Although they are complicated and
expensive, Iridium's low-earth orbiting satellites have worked
pretty much as billed.
</P>
<P>
   The real problem has been more prosaic: unimaginably bad
marketing. Well before Iridium was launched, there were concerns
that the company was in danger of setting its prices too high.
</P>
<P>
   Iridium's handsets cost more than $3,000 and call charges ranged
from $2 to $7 a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Staiano, Iridium's chief executive until he abruptly quit
in April, believed that by being the first MSS firm, Iridium could
charge a premium that would help pay for its over-budget $5 billion
platform.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, the Iridium handset is an off-putting
brick 7 inches (18 centimeters) long, weighing 1 pound (450 grams).
</P>
<P>
   It poignantly recalls the pioneering days of mobile phones a
decade and a half ago. Even then Iridium's telephones were not
available in the modest numbers needed.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturing delays at Motorola and Kyocera left customers
waiting until February to get their telephones. If they had been
supplied earlier, the firm's distribution partners would probably
not have been ready to sell them.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint, an American long-distance carrier, will begin its first
promotional campaign soon _ a good ten months after Iridium's
launch; Telecom Italia, another lethargic distributor, is only now
training its sales force to sell the devices.
</P>
<P>
   An advertising campaign last year, costing $180 million, was
meant to bring in 500,000 customers by the end of March. Iridium's
new chief executive, a blunt Australian called John Richardson, now
describes its theme _ ``Calling Planet Earth'' _ as ``schmoozy and
generic'' lifestyle marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Instead Iridium should have aimed its message at those who
really need the service and given them lots of useful information.
</P>
<P>
   In the short-term, Iridium might salvage something. Its
satellites are flying, the service works reasonably, the new
tariffs are more realistic, the marketing will improve, and
cheaper, better handsets are on their way.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, still a problem. ICO, Iridium's rival,
calculates that, of the three MSS services, Iridium has by far the
highest costs.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that each system carries 1 billion minutes of calls a
year, the cost of a minute using Iridium's system is $1.28 compared
with 51 cents a minute for Globalstar and 35 cents for ICO.
</P>
<P>
   The difference arises mainly because Iridium's satellites are
both more numerous and use more power to maintain their low-earth
orbits. They will thus need replacing within five to seven years of
being launched.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, ICO's ten satellites fly about 9,000 kilometers
higher in medium-earth orbit and have a life span of 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   With its prices already far lower than it had planned for and
two lower-cost operators yet to enter the market, Iridium's future
is questionable, even if it can battle through its current
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Globalstar and ICO are crowing over Iridium's
difficulties. ICO, which went public last year, has seen its share
price driven down from $16.5 to $5 as the scale of the Iridium
debacle has become apparent.
</P>
<P>
   A rights issue intended to raise $500 million failed to reach
its target and has been extended to the end of July. ICO will
probably succeed in raising the money, but only at greater cost.
</P>
<P>
   And although even Iridium's Richardson admits that ``we cocked
it up,'' doubts about the size and value of the market for MSS will
inevitably linger until more subscribers begin to appear.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody believes that $17 billion-worth of the latest satellites
will circle the globe ignored and in silence, but scarred investors
can be excused if, in future, they take little on trust. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Just 1.6 percent of visits to online merchants result in a
purchase, according to a study by the Boston Consulting Group for
Shop.org, an industry organization for Web retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Why? After security and privacy concerns, consumers cite the
need to reenter personal data at different merchants as one of the
main drawbacks of shopping online, says David Pecaut, head of the
E-commerce practice at Boston Consulting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wallet,'' he says, ``has the potential to make things much
simpler.''
</P>
<P>
   What's a virtual wallet? Simply a standardized form into which
you enter your name, address, and credit-card number. Every time
you make a purchase online, the affiliated merchant gets access to
your billing and mailing data from the wallet.
</P>
<P>
   A boon for cyber-shoppers? It promises to be, but it isn't yet.
</P>
<P>
   The assortment of wallets is likely to confuse even hard-core
techies. Expect to encounter pitches for virtual wallets from
online stores, Web portal sites like Yahoo and Excite, and banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have a chaotic period,'' says Denis Yaro, executive
vice-president of CyberCash, an electronic-commerce company in
Reston, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The CyberCash solution, InstaBuy, lets you sign up for a wallet
at a participating merchant and use it to shop at other InstaBuy
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Through partnerships with SkyMall and the Impulse Buy Network,
InstaBuy customers have access to more than 150 stores, including
such high-end retailers as Calyx &AMP; Corolla and Sharper Image.
</P>
<P>
   InstaBuy is a ``server-based'' solution: It stores your personal
data on a remote computer. Obviously aware of consumers' concerns
about hackers, CyberCash is teaming up with financial institutions,
such as First USA, to secure shoppers' financial information.
</P>
<P>

   Just 1.6 percent of visits to online merchants result in a

 By STEPHEN M. POLLAN  
 c.1999 Worth Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sought after though they have become, employment contracts are
fraught with pitfalls for executives.
</P>
<P>
   Their status as status symbol is, of itself, a danger. Managers
often are so flattered to have one they don't realize what they've
signed away to get it.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, even the most seemingly innocuous provisions _ such
as the basic job description _ can have unexpected consequences.
Boss to employee: ``It says here you agreed to work anywhere in the
U.S. I'm sure you'll just love your new assignment in Hammond,
Indiana.''
</P>
<P>
   Look at it this way: Your employer undoubtedly has negotiated a
lot more of these deals than you ever will (or at least let's hope
that's the case). So who's more likely to gain the upper hand?
</P>
<P>
   To help even the odds, here's a provision-by-provision guide to
the modern employment contract, along with some pointers.
</P>
<P>
   1. TERM: This section defines the length of the contract _ one
year, two years, etc. Its inclusion is more than a formality. In
most states, employers can fire an employee for any reason at any
time and without further compensation (unless civil-rights or
discrimination laws apply).
</P>
<P>
   However, if your contract specifies the term of employment,
you're entitled to receive the balance due if you're canned without
cause (as defined in Section 5 of this article).
</P>
<P>
   2. DUTIES: Many employment contracts are far too vague or
sketchy when it comes to defining the job itself. There's nothing
wrong with flexibility, of course _ so long as everyone's happy.
But if the relationship sours, latitude makes it possible for an
employer to dream up loathsome or even humiliating work assignments
_ perhaps in a deliberate effort to persuade the employee to quit.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, you and your employer can always agree to make changes
in a contract. So if your pride can't stand emptying the trash or
having your desk moved to the stairwell, make sure your contract
says something about what you'll be doing and where you will be
doing it. (One client of mine got a clause that allowed him to work
one month each year in Vail, Colo.).
</P>
<P>
   Get as specific a description of your duties and
responsibilities as you can. If that's not possible, at least make
sure this section of your contract says that your duties will be
restricted to those that are ``reasonable and customary'' for the
position you hold.
</P>
<P>
   3. COMPENSATION: The rule here: If it ain't written down, it
ain't going to end up in your pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Everything that can be remotely considered compensation _ from
vacation days and perks to salary and stock options _ should be
detailed in this section. (This is where you can ask for a rabbi
trust or a paid-for vacation home in the Hamptons, as clients of
mine have done.)
</P>
<P>
   Unless you don't expect a raise during the time period covered
by the agreement, this section should also spell out the procedure
for determining pay increases.
</P>
<P>
   4. EXCLUSIVE EMPLOYMENT: Many companies today offer employment
contracts precisely because they want their charges to sign a
document that restricts their ability to jump ship _ or take
proprietary information with them when they do.
</P>
<P>
   The covenants contained in this section are where employers seek
to obtain this protection. In other words: Watch your flanks. Your
objective should be to give yourself as much career flexibility as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Employers like to push for extreme limits on whom you can work
for and when. In a sense, they'd just as soon have you drop off the
face of the earth if you're not going to be toiling for them.
</P>
<P>
   In examining the validity of the exclusions contained in this
section, courts weigh the employer's legitimate business interests
against the ability of an employee to earn a livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a court might agree to bar the employee of a
children's TV program on cable television from working for another
show with a similar audience. But the court might let the employee
work for a cable-TV show about monster trucks. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 675) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While there's no requirement for employers to offer employees
compensation for these covenants, such payments have sometimes
helped courts overcome their problems with employee livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if you can't eliminate or soften restrictions on
where you can earn a living, try to shorten the period and/or get
compensation for them.
</P>
<P>
   You can also work to subtly undermine exclusions you can't
negotiate away through your choice of the law governing the
agreement (see Section 7. Governing Law. Jurisdiction).
</P>
<P>
   Companies understandably try to keep all internal information
confidential. Nevertheless, courts have ruled that there are limits
to confidentiality. Client lists, for instance, are protected only
if the information can't be obtained elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, publicly known or previously published contracts,
pricing policies, and buying habits aren't protected. That doesn't
mean the provisions don't have some teeth: Courts have held
employees liable for the disclosure of confidential information
whether or not the disclosure was willful. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   5. REASONS FOR TERMINATION: A paragraph should be added that
provides for a ``cure period'' during which, after a warning, you
are given a chance to address your employer's complaints about your
work. This should apply to performance issues _ a failure to
produce promised results _ instead of, say, a conviction for
insider trading.
</P>
<P>
   If your employer balks at such language, explain that the firm
will benefit by having its potential exposure to litigation
limited.
</P>
<P>
   An additional reason for termination is ``change of control or
ownership.'' This should be specifically listed here so that it can
be discussed in the subsequent section.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, wording should be included that calls or ample notice
(such as six months) if your contract isn't going to be renewed.
</P>
<P>
   6. RESULTS OF TERMINATION: Ask for full payment of your
contracted salary if you're terminated without cause or if your
employer breaches the agreement. But be prepared to cut a deal. By
expanding the reasons for termination in the previous section, you
can include language here outlining your severance rights after a
change in management or ownership.
</P>
<P>
   7. GOVERNING LAW. JURISDICTION: This may seem like neutral
boilerplate. It's not. The common-law obligations of employers and
employees vary from state to state. So, too, does the way local
courts interpret and enforce the covenants outlined in Section 4.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of governing law and jurisdiction in the agreement
will ultimately determine what elements of Section 4 can be
enforced and how strenuously they will be enforced.
</P>
<P>
   Use the state law most beneficial to you. If, for example, you
work in the California office of a corporation headquartered in
Alabama, your employer will want Alabama law to govern the
contract, since it's considered employer-friendly. But California
law is employee-friendly. &QL;

U.S. I'm sure you'll just love your new assignment in Hammond,
Indiana.''
</P>
<P>
   Look at it this way: Your employer undoubtedly has negotiated a
lot more of these deals than you ever will (or at least let's hope
that's the case). So who's more likely to gain the upper hand?
</P>
<P>
   To help even the odds, here's a provision-by-provision guide to
the modern employment contract, along with some pointers.
</P>
<P>
   1. TERM: This section defines the length of the contract _ one
year, two years, etc. Its inclusion is more than a formality. In
most states, employers can fire an employee for any reason at any
time and without further compensation (unless civil-rights or
discrimination laws apply).
</P>
<P>
   However, if your contract specifies the term of employment,
you're entitled to receive the balance due if you're canned without
cause (as defined in Section 5 of this article).
</P>
<P>
   2. DUTIES: Many employment contracts are far too vague or
sketchy when it comes to defining the job itself. There's nothing
wrong with flexibility, of course _ so long as everyone's happy.
But if the relationship sours, latitude makes it possible for an
employer to dream up loathsome or even humiliating work assignments
_ perhaps in a deliberate effort to persuade the employee to quit.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, you and your employer can always agree to make changes
in a contract. So if your pride can't stand emptying the trash or
having your desk moved to the stairwell, make sure your contract
says something about what you'll be doing and where you will be
doing it. (One client of mine got a clause that allowed him to work
one month each year in Vail, Colo.).
</P>
<P>
   Get as specific a description of your duties and
responsibilities as you can. If that's not possible, at least make
sure this section of your contract says that your duties will be
restricted to those that are ``reasonable and customary'' for the
position you hold.
</P>
<P>
   3. COMPENSATION: The rule here: If it ain't written down, it
ain't going to end up in your pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Everything that can be remotely considered compensation _ from
vacation days and perks to salary and stock options _ should be
detailed in this section. (This is where you can ask for a rabbi
trust or a paid-for vacation home in the Hamptons, as clients of
mine have done.)
</P>
<P>
   Unless you don't expect a raise during the time period covered
by the agreement, this section should also spell out the procedure
for determining pay increases.
</P>
<P>
   4. EXCLUSIVE EMPLOYMENT: Many companies today offer employment
contracts precisely because they want their charges to sign a
document that restricts their ability to jump ship _ or take
proprietary information with them when they do.
</P>
<P>
   The covenants contained in this section are where employers seek
to obtain this protection. In other words: Watch your flanks. Your
objective should be to give yourself as much career flexibility as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Employers like to push for extreme limits on whom you can work
for and when. In a sense, they'd just as soon have you drop off the
face of the earth if you're not going to be toiling for them.
</P>
<P>
   In examining the validity of the exclusions contained in this
section, courts weigh the employer's legitimate business interests
against the ability of an employee to earn a livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a court might agree to bar the employee of a
children's TV program on cable television from working for another
show with a similar audience. But the court might let the employee
work for a cable-TV show about monster trucks. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 675) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While there's no requirement for employers to offer employees
compensation for these covenants, such payments have sometimes
helped courts overcome their problems with employee livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if you can't eliminate or soften restrictions on
where you can earn a living, try to shorten the period and/or get
compensation for them.
</P>
<P>
   You can also work to subtly undermine exclusions you can't
negotiate away through your choice of the law governing the
agreement (see Section 7. Governing Law. Jurisdiction).
</P>
<P>
   Companies understandably try to keep all internal information
confidential. Nevertheless, courts have ruled that there are limits
to confidentiality. Client lists, for instance, are protected only
if the information can't be obtained elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, publicly known or previously published contracts,
pricing policies, and buying habits aren't protected. That doesn't
mean the provisions don't have some teeth: Courts have held
employees liable for the disclosure of confidential information
whether or not the disclosure was willful. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   5. REASONS FOR TERMINATION: A paragraph should be added that
provides for a ``cure period'' during which, after a warning, you
are given a chance to address your employer's complaints about your
work. This should apply to performance issues _ a failure to
produce promised results _ instead of, say, a conviction for
insider trading.
</P>
<P>
   If your employer balks at such language, explain that the firm
will benefit by having its potential exposure to litigation
limited.
</P>
<P>
   An additional reason for termination is ``change of control or
ownership.'' This should be specifically listed here so that it can
be discussed in the subsequent section.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, wording should be included that calls or ample notice
(such as six months) if your contract isn't going to be renewed.
</P>
<P>
   6. RESULTS OF TERMINATION: Ask for full payment of your
contracted salary if you're terminated without cause or if your
employer breaches the agreement. But be prepared to cut a deal. By
expanding the reasons for termination in the previous section, you
can include language here outlining your severance rights after a
change in management or ownership.
</P>
<P>
   7. GOVERNING LAW. JURISDICTION: This may seem like neutral
boilerplate. It's not. The common-law obligations of employers and
employees vary from state to state. So, too, does the way local
courts interpret and enforce the covenants outlined in Section 4.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of governing law and jurisdiction in the agreement
will ultimately determine what elements of Section 4 can be
enforced and how strenuously they will be enforced.
</P>
<P>
   Use the state law most beneficial to you. If, for example, you
work in the California office of a corporation headquartered in
Alabama, your employer will want Alabama law to govern the
contract, since it's considered employer-friendly. But California
law is employee-friendly. &QL;

   Sought after though they have become, employment contracts are
fraught with pitfalls for executives.
</P>
<P>
   Their status as status symbol is, of itself, a danger. Managers
often are so flattered to have one they don't realize what they've
signed away to get it.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, even the most seemingly innocuous provisions _ such
as the basic job description _ can have unexpected consequences.
Boss to employee: ``It says here you agreed to work anywhere in the

<P>
   Just 1.6 percent of visits to online merchants result in a
purchase, according to a study by the Boston Consulting Group for
Shop.org, an industry organization for Web retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Why? After security and privacy concerns, consumers cite the
need to reenter personal data at different merchants as one of the
main drawbacks of shopping online, says David Pecaut, head of the
E-commerce practice at Boston Consulting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wallet,'' he says, ``has the potential to make things much
simpler.''
</P>
<P>
   What's a virtual wallet? Simply a standardized form into which
you enter your name, address, and credit-card number. Every time
you make a purchase online, the affiliated merchant gets access to
your billing and mailing data from the wallet.
</P>
<P>
   A boon for cyber-shoppers? It promises to be, but it isn't yet.
</P>
<P>
   The assortment of wallets is likely to confuse even hard-core
techies. Expect to encounter pitches for virtual wallets from
online stores, Web portal sites like Yahoo and Excite, and banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have a chaotic period,'' says Denis Yaro, executive
vice-president of CyberCash, an electronic-commerce company in
Reston, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The CyberCash solution, InstaBuy, lets you sign up for a wallet
at a participating merchant and use it to shop at other InstaBuy
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Through partnerships with SkyMall and the Impulse Buy Network,
InstaBuy customers have access to more than 150 stores, including
such high-end retailers as Calyx &AMP; Corolla and Sharper Image.
</P>
<P>
   InstaBuy is a ``server-based'' solution: It stores your personal
data on a remote computer. Obviously aware of consumers' concerns
about hackers, CyberCash is teaming up with financial institutions,
such as First USA, to secure shoppers' financial information.
</P>
<P>
   America Online has a wallet of its own, enabling consumers to
shop at affiliated merchants without reentering personal data.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's Quick Checkout lets members store information for up to 10
credit cards and 50 shipping addresses; the data is kept on AOL's
servers. For security reasons, the full credit-card number is never
displayed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another option is eWallet, a software application that can
be downloaded (at www.ewallet.com). EWallet stores your personal
data on your computer, which may be more secure, but this also
requires you to install and maintain the software yourself.
</P>
<P>
   EWallet works at nearly all Web stores; when you're ready to
make a purchase, eWallet helps you with the forms. During the
holiday season, about 250,000 copies of eWallet were downloaded.
</P>
<P>
   For all the uncertainty over the eventual standard-bearer, one
thing is certain: Not all of these wallets will be in use a year
from now.
</P>
<P>
   In the standard-less interim, choose a wallet with care. Don't
try them all, or you may find yourself with multiple accounts at
some merchants. Consider the stores connected with the wallet; for
now, selection is probably the deciding factor.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a regular at just one or two online shops, don't
bother with a wallet. As with much that involves consumer
technology, you won't miss a lot by waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, one or more of these systems will achieve that magic
combo of convenience and ubiquity. Until then, America Online and
the portal sites have an edge, largely because they have the
attention of millions of consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate winner will let you buy from any store on the Web,
or close to it, without downloading software to your PC. By then,
the wallet will help you find the best prices for your items of
choice.
</P>
<P>
   The wallet may even suggest, based on your past purchases, what
wines or books you might like to buy. Sort of scary, but
convenient, too. ``Chaos doesn't reign very long,'' says Yaro. ``It
won't be tolerated.'' &QL;

WHEN GOLF COURSES MAKE IT TOO EASY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSAN FORNOFF  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Scott Hoch once called St. Andrews, revered as
hallowed ground by much of the golfing world, ``the worst piece of
mess I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   After a U.S. Open played on so-called turtle-back greens, and
with Carnoustie confounding a field of the world's best players
this week at the British Open, we are forced to raise the issue of
``playability.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the buzzword of tee-time marketing in the '90s, invoked to
indicate that a course is player-friendly and won't lead to a box
of lost balls or a bag of clubs broken in anger.
</P>
<P>
   Playability also promises rounds that do not take anywhere near
five hours, and it is increasingly requiring the kind of manicuring
that makes a course, well, easier.
</P>
<P>
   Lose a tree here, lop off the weeds there, move the tees up
everywhere. Is this what we want?
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Kalkowski, the head pro at the much-maligned and very
challenging Bodega Harbour Golf Links, says he hopes not.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first opened, we filled in a lot of bunkers because
they were playability issues,'' Kalkowski said. ``By that I mean
they were playability issues for everyone. If you can't get out, no
matter how good a player you are, it's a playability issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``But more and more courses are softening the golf course to
such an extent that it's taking away from the experience of playing
that course.''
</P>
<P>
   Trish Hinze, the head pro at player-friendly Tilden Park, says
she thinks it's a question of fairness.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shouldn't have to pay with two or three or four strokes
when you miss the center of the fairway by just a little bit,'' she
said. ``Penalize me when I deserve it, but not with a mogul or
bunker in the middle of the fairway.''
</P>
<P>
   The former Sonoma Golf Club, now renamed the Sonoma Mission Inn
Golf and Country Club, used to have deep grass bunkers hidden in
places where one might indeed try to place a shot.
</P>
<P>
   The new management has done away with those in the name of
playability, and few would complain. After all, if scores go down,
well, it's not such a bad thing to send more players away smiling,
is it?
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, we golfers have to remember to enjoy the game
itself, not just excelling at the game. Last month in North
Carolina, I played a course called Tobacco Road, designed by
renowned toughie Mike Strantz on a sand pit. There was no
out-of-bounds, just one hazard that I recall, and you could easily
play 18 holes with just one ball.
</P>
<P>
   But the yardage book was essential because you usually couldn't
see where you were going, our round took five hours aboard carts,
and I didn't play very well. Amazingly, I remember this magnificent
creation with a smile on my face and a twinkle in my eye, and can't
wait to go back.
</P>
<P>
   Here's hoping Strantz and other such bright lights never lack
for work in the name of playability, Hoch and his ilk leave St.
Andrews alone, and golf courses never have to be easy to be great.

BANNER YEAR FOR SALMON CATCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM STIENSTRA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If you could put the next five weeks of fishing
for salmon in the San Francisco Bay Area in a time capsule, you
might look back deep in the next century and say, ``Yeah, I
remember the good ol' days.''
</P>
<P>
   At Chimney Rock at Point Reyes this past week, there were so
many boats, at least 500, that the blips on the radar scope looked
like an attack of green gnats. In dead fog, you could hear the
shouts of excitement carrying across the water as anglers battled
away with the biggest salmon documented in 25 years in local
waters.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody's calling them ``bombers.'' That's because the average
fish, instead of a 6- to 8-pounder as in so many past summers, is
now an 18- to 20-pounder, with more salmon over 20 than under.
</P>
<P>
   There are so many 30s that it takes a 40 to get your name in the
paper, and I will predict right now there will be more 50-pounders
caught this year than any time previously documented.
</P>
<P>
   It's as if all the planets are in alignment and the big salmon
in the sky is making up for years when things weren't always the
greatest.
</P>
<P>
   Hordes of big salmon suddenly emerged at three spots, off
Chimney Rock at Point Reyes, the mouth of Salmon Creek north of
Bodega Bay, and Martin's Beach south of Half Moon Bay. To get the
idea of what is possible, a typical score for the New Sea Angler
was 74 salmon (limits) for 37 people, with many of the fish over 25
pounds, and from start to finish, there were three to five
hook-ups, nonstop.
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons why the salmon are as big as in Alaska
and coming at a faster catch-rate per hour.
</P>
<P>
   One is a final payback from the El Nino weather phenomenon in
1997 and 1998. Many salmon did not return on their three-year cycle
to the Gulf of the Farallones, as is typical, apparently driven far
off the coast by warm water in search of food. This year they are
back, a year older and a year bigger, still growing an inch per
month.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the ocean is full of feed. John Tarantino Jr., a
bait operator, told me on the docks in San Francisco that there are
more anchovies and baby sardines than they can remember in three
generations of operations. So the salmon are out there gorging
away, creating an armada of bombers.
</P>
<P>
   The California Department of Fish and Game salmon forecast this
year was for one of great abundance. But from the opener through
much of June, winds and high seas made it impossible on many days
for anybody to reach the fish; I've had five trips canceled from
rough weather.
</P>
<P>
   That means those fish were not caught early as in a typical
year's pattern but are still out there. Now they are schooling
around the hordes of anchovies, bountiful from the months of
upwelling that has created cool, plankton-rich waters.

HOME MAY BE WORST PLACE FOR THE ALLERGIC
</HEADLINE>
  Includes color cartoon of a sick house 
 By CINNAMON BAIR 
 c.1999 New York Times Newspaper Group

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When allergy and asthma sufferers retreat inside to avoid pollen
season, they're likely exposing themselves to a host of other
allergens.
</P>
<P>
   Dust mites lurk in bedding, carpets and upholstery. Mold invades
the bathroom and kitchen. And pets unwittingly scatter their dander
throughout the house.
</P>
<P>
   Allergists and other experts prescribe a schedule of thorough
cleaning and a few specialized products to help make homes
allergy-free zones.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once you've developed an allergy, avoidance is the best
treatment,'' says Dr. Susan Aguiar, an ear, nose and throat
specialist in Lakeland, Fla. ''It's an exposure thing as much as
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem in the home is dust mites, says Dr. Lionel
Bonini, an allergist with Watson Clinic in Lakeland. Mites are
''microscopic little roaches'' that live in warm environments, such
as bedding, carpets and upholstery, and feed off dead skin that has
flaked off the body.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both their body parts and their droppings cause allergies in
people,'' Bonini says.
</P>
<P>
   Dust mites especially love beds _ a place where people spend a
significant amount of their time. Therefore allergy experts say the
bed should receive the greatest amount of attention to reduce
allergens as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, all bedding, including mattress covers and
comforters, should be washed once a week in hot water, says Mary
Ann Peters, owner of The Allergy Relief Store in Brandon, Fla. The
water temperature must be at least 130 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Allergy sufferers may also want to invest in mattress and pillow
covers that can help make beds more mite-resistant, say the
experts.
</P>
<P>
   The covers suffocate existing mites and prevent other mites from
moving in.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like an envelope you stick the mattress in and zip it
up,'' Peters says.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for the covers vary according to how comfortable the
material is, she says. But customers can generally expect to pay
between $95 and $120 to outfit a king-size bed with covers for the
mattress, box springs and pillows.
</P>
<P>
   Another homebound threat faced by most allergy sufferers is
pets, Aguiar says. The skin particles shed by dogs and cats, known
as dander, can rapidly spread through the house and cause allergic
reactions for any allergy sufferer who walks in the door.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very small antigen, and it can get everywhere
quickly,'' she says. ''It will stick around for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   The best prevention is not to have a dog or a cat in the house
at all, Aguiar says. If they must be kept in the house, Aguiar
suggests they be confined to one room. Animals should be banned
from bedrooms, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Aguiar also suggests regularly washing cats, whose dander is
particularly allergenic. Pet owners can get their cats to cooperate
during the bath by holding onto the nape of their necks, which
restricts their movements.
</P>
<P>
   Other options include dander-sealing products, such as Shed
Away, Peters says. Shed Away, which costs about $14, helps regulate
pet shedding and prevents dander from spreading.
</P>
<P>
   Washable electrostatic filters for heating and cooling systems
are much more effective than throw-away filters in reducing the
amount of dust in the house. Having the heating and
air-conditioning coils cleaned once a year can also cut down on the
dust that is being circulated by the system.
</P>
<P>
   Another major allergen in homes is mold.
</P>
<P>
   To control mold growth, Aguiar says homeowners should run their
air conditioning to help regulate humidity. When mold is found in
the home, the surface should be thoroughly cleaned.
</P>
<P>
   Because dust mites, dander and mold also travel on dust
particles in the air, Peters suggests that allergy sufferers invest
in a good vacuum cleaner with a HEPA filter or, at the minimum, buy
specialized bags that prevent dust from blowing back into the air.
The bags fit most standard vacuum cleaners and cost about $9 for a
pack of three. Free-standing, electric HEPA air filters may help as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Other suggestions for reducing allergens in the homes include
changing air-conditioning filters regularly, keeping clutter to a
minimum, using wood or plastic furnishings rather than upholstery
when possible, and ripping up the carpets in favor of bare wood or
tile floors.
</P>
<P>
   Wall-to-wall carpeting is like going back to ''living in caves
with dirt floors,'' Bonini says.
</P>
<P>
   For the best results, several different allergy-reducing ideas
and products should be employed throughout the house rather than
one or two things here or there.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any one measure does not work that well,'' Bonini says. ''But
if you do a little bit of everything, it makes a difference.''

PRE-PLANNING HELPS FIND LOST KIDS FASTER
</HEADLINE>
  By PATRICK BOYLE 
 c.1999 Child 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ''I turned around and she was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   These are words that you never want to hear yourself say, but
they're what Peter Banks found himself saying to workers at a
drugstore where he had been shopping with his 2-year-old daughter.
Banks, a Washington, D.C., police officer, was trained to handle
frightening situations, _ but nothing had prepared him for the
''sheer terror'' that gripped him when his daughter Meredith
suddenly disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ''What does she look like?'' the store manager asked.
</P>
<P>
   ''My mind went blank,'' Banks recalls.
</P>
<P>
   The manager made an announcement alerting shoppers to watch for
a lost toddler, unaware that Meredith had already gone exploring
elsewhere. A shopper happened to go to a neighboring store, says
Banks, ''and there was my daughter clutching a candy bar.''
</P>
<P>
   It happens countless times each day, in stores, amusement parks,
beaches, and parks all over the country: Parents and kids lose each
other.
</P>
<P>
   In the majority of cases, parent and child will reunite after a
little searching and a few tears. But the dangers range from
emotional trauma to accidental injury to _ in very rare cases _
abduction. Arming yourself and your child with a ''just in case''
strategy will greatly increase the chances that you'll be safely
reunited if you do get separated.
</P>
<P>
   Banks, who is now the director of training and outreach at the
National Center for Missing &AMP; Exploited Children in Arlington, Va.,
says preparation is key. Always carry a current photo of your child
to help anyone trying to find her. Write descriptive information
such as height and weight on the back. Being able to describe what
your child is wearing is equally important.
</P>
<P>
   Help your child learn to say her name, her parents' names, her
address, and phone number. However, remember that a 4-year-old who
can recite all that to you may not do so well under the stress of
being lost. Until you're sure she has this information committed to
memory, write it on a piece of paper that you routinely tuck into
her pocket or shoe.
</P>
<P>
   The question of how far to let your child wander from you in a
public place is a matter of judgment. Consider your child's age,
maturity, and the location when deciding. While experts can offer
guidelines, they say that parents should always err on the side of
caution.
</P>
<P>
   Diana Jones _ a Mount Kisco, New York-based psychologist
recommends that when traveling with more than one child and adult,
each grownup be responsible for watching specific kids.
</P>
<P>
   If you discover that your child is gone, spend just a few
seconds looking in the immediate area _ then get help from the
nearest employee or security officer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't stand around wondering if you should call security,''
Banks says. ''Call them. If you end up finding your child right
away, great.'' Kids need three rules
</P>
<P>
   What should your lost child do? He should follow three basic
rules: 1. Stay put. 2. Talk to a ''safe adult.'' 3. Don't go
anywhere with someone you don't know.
</P>
<P>
   The first rule is crucial, says Banks, because parents and other
searchers will comb the area in which a child was last seen. A
wandering child is much harder to find and is more likely to get
hurt_ falling down a flight of stairs, for instance. In addition,
kids should not go with someone they don't know.
</P>
<P>
   Who are safe adults? In general, they are store or park
employees and security officers _ people wearing name badges and
uniforms, says Wendy Gordon, author of ''I'm Safe,'' a series of
children's safety books.
</P>
<P>
   While the basic rules are the same for all kids, your child's
age will determine how you communicate those rules and how your
youngster carries them out Remember that discussing the rules once
is not enough. Periodically review the guidelines with your child
when you're in a public place. Gordon suggests making a game of it
saying, ''Let's look for someone with a name badge.''
</P>
<P>
   When reviewing safety rules with your preschooler, keep them
simple. ''Stay put'' can be explained as standing where she is and
calling out for Mom or Dad. Emphasize that she must not go looking
for you _ that you will find her.
</P>
<P>
   Give grade-schoolers clear safety instructions ''It's harder to
keep track of children as they grow older,'' says Susan Slanina of
Herndon, Va., whose children are 5 and 8. Parents typically give
more leeway to kids this age, allowing them to walk several yards
away, go to the next aisle of a store, or play in a different
section of the playground. ''The problem,'' says Slanina, ''is that
we think they're following us or that they're paying attention and
know where we are. Then we turn around and discover they've
wandered off.''
</P>
<P>
   On the bright side, says Jones, ''With kids this age, you can be
more explicit in your instructions.'' You can tell your child that
if he loses you, staying put means remaining in the immediate area,
such as the same department of the store. If he gets separated from
you on a busy sidewalk, says Banks, he should go into the nearest
store and ask a safe adult for help.
</P>
<P>
   Some 5- to 8-year-olds are mature enough to walk over to a safe
adult who's in sight such as an employee at a nearby cash register.
'Tell your child to say, 'My dad _ or mom _ is lost Can you help me
find him? '''Banks, says. But repeat that he should not leave the
area to go hunting for a safe adult.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, use role-playing to reinforce the rules. Ask your
child to point out safe adults to you. Stress that he is not
required to go anywhere with anyone, including to a security
office, Banks says. Have him respond, ''Mom wants me to stay where
I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Older kids should remain where they are when lost. Parents often
start letting their 9- to 12- year-olds out of their sight for
longer periods, while still setting guidelines for them. Your child
may go to browse in the next shop for 10 minutes or to buy candy at
a nearby carnival booth and then come back to you.
</P>
<P>
   If you offer such options, Jones advises, make sure your
youngster wears a watch, so that she doesn't have to depend on
asking other people for the time.
</P>
<P>
   Staying put if you get separated is still the safest option for
your child, says Banks. But you can judge, starting at this age,
whether your child is mature enough for the two of you to pick a
central place to meet if you lose track of each other in a store,
mall, or park. Some kids may also feel comfortable going to a
nearby pay phone and calling 911 (for free) or a parent's beeper to
report that they are lost, says Jones. So always make sure your
child carries enough change to make a phone call.
</P>
<P>
   A risk here is some kids may feel independent enough to search
for a security officer to help find their parents or to go where
they think their parents have gone. You can have a detailed
conversation with your preteen to explain why such wanderings will
make it harder for the two of you to find each other. Explain that
it's important to stay in the same area while watching for a safe
adult.
</P>
<P>
   Getting separated from Mom or Dad can be a scary experience, but
your child will be better able to cope if you've given her the
tools to handle the dilemma.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Bookstore speaks volumes about
20th century
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Paris was where the 20th century was.'' _ Gertrude Stein
</P>
<P>
   PARIS _ The notice outside Shakespeare and Co. invites visitors
to ask about the bookstore's plans for celebrating the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Don't ask.
</P>
<P>
   Leastwise don't ask George Whitman, proprietor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'll make it that long,'' Whitman croaked.
``I'm 88 years old. The people who work here will have to organize
it for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the young women clerks, her arms loaded with books for
restocking of ancient shelves, looked up from her work, smiled and
shook her head. I understood the smile to say, ``Don't you believe
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, Whitman let himself be convinced otherwise without
hardly pausing for a breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I suppose New Year's we'll have to put on somewhat more of
a show. Christmas, we always celebrate in a big way, not New
Year's. This year, we'll have to make an exception, but nothing all
that extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   It's certainly the spot for it. Shakespeare and Co., its Left
Bank location almost within the shadow of Notre Dame, is tucked
back behind an esplanade, with room enough for several hundred
people to gather in front of the shop.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the crowd that showed up for Shakespeare and Co.'s
Fourth of July celebration, which featured an Ernest Hemingway
lookalike, this month being the centennial celebration of
Hemingway's birth.
</P>
<P>
   A few months from now, Whitman says, the shop will host an
American writer still very much alive, beat poet Lawrence
Ferlinghetti, who will be here to read a selection of his works.
</P>
<P>
   The name Shakespeare and Co., opened by Whitman in 1951, gives
homage to the store made famous in the 1920s by Sylvia Beach, also
an American, who encouraged writers such as Hemingway during his
Paris years.
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly, it was Miss Beach who published James Joyce's
masterpiece, ``Ulysses,'' at a time when no one dared to.
</P>
<P>
   The original site, at No. 12 rue de l'Odeon, is marked today
only by a small plaque noting that Sylvia Beach once lived there
and little more.
</P>
<P>
   A year or so ago, a wrought-iron sculpture made from a photo of
Joyce and Beach's companion, book dealer Adrienne Monnier, was
displayed across the street.
</P>
<P>
   Now it has disappeared, evidently stolen. A reward for its
return was offered, but to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   As for the current Shakespeare and Co., there's nothing much
new, Whitman says.
</P>
<P>
   Housed in what was a monastery in the 16th century, the
three-story shop offers some 30,000 volumes, including rare
editions, and remains an oasis for young writers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're an oasis for everybody,'' Whitman said, ``but we do give
priority to writers.''
</P>
<P>
   At present, a pair of Irish poets are in residence in the
top-floor apartment. Each Sunday, tea is served from 4 p.m. until 6
p.m. for Americans in Paris. Poetry readings are held each Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise ...
</P>
<P>
   ``The girls who sell books here are full of smiles and laughter
and bubbling with the joy of life,'' Whitman said. ``This is a
coming venture. I'm just fading away, getting in people's way in my
old age.''
</P>
<P>
   As he speaks, indeed, the girls are full of smiles.

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: A story as much about us
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some people have 15 minutes of fame. John F. Kennedy Jr. had 38
years.
</P>
<P>
   He was, by all accounts, a decent young man with no airs or
damage from years of media scrutiny. He tried to make something of
himself, and became more famous for his trouble. He seemed to
reject being famous for being famous, the glamorous hunk, People
magazine's ``Sexiest Man Alive.''
</P>
<P>
   His death and the spectacular media and public reaction that
attended it forms a meditation on what it means to be famous in
America. John Kennedy Jr. remains as elusive in death as his
father. That will add to his fame.
</P>
<P>
   John Jr.'s public memory seems to rely on what each person
thought he meant, what comfort each derives from a life perceived
darkly at great distance. He was a human being people might have
known and liked had things worked out. A human being who might have
liked them. A reminder that even for the ostensibly famous and
glamorous, life is every bit as savagely whimsical.

   BUSH-RANCH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CRAWFORD, Texas _ That Texas Gov. George W. Bush is shopping for
ranch land seven miles from Crawford is the worst kept secret in
Central Texa.s The prospect of endless van loads of gawkers
traipsing by what could be the Western White House makes some folks
giddy with the thought of a revised local economy. But a few dread
the idea that the front-runner for the Republican presidential
nomination might become a neighbor. Traffic has already picked up
noticeably, apparently as the curious hope to catch a glimpse of
the property. The ranch is located past the Broken Spoke Ranch,
past the house with an upset owner and very mean black dog. By
BARRY SHLACHTER. Story will move in ``a'' general news category.

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The anthrax vaccination currently being

through a needle. But in Texas, the vaccinations appear to be
creating few waves, at least so far. By CHRIS VAUGHN. Story will

   PASADENA, Calif. _ Network television, wounded from the hits it
has been taking for offering too much violence and too few people
of color, is washing off the sludge in preparation for its annual
media free-for-all, beginning on Tuesday when UPN unveils its new
season. That's not a great start, we know. But as any television
exec worth that high six-figure salary would remind you, this
annual summer meeting for TV critics is closer to a marathon than a

Hemingway remains possibly the most celebrated and certainly the

is published. Then she strikes gold. One book becomes a bestseller,
and eventually another makes it to the top of all the major
bestseller lists, among them The New York Times. She sells the
rights to Hollywood, and Mom becomes a celebrity author. She and
Dad move to the mountains and live happily ever after. The odds
against this dream coming true defy calculation, and yet it just
happened to the 56-year-old Evanovich. By JEFF GUINN. Story will

   NEW YORK _ Fashion appears to have lost its newest and brightest
fashion icon _ the only real successor to her mother-in-law,
Jacqueline Onassis.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities offer little hope that Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and
her husband, John F. Kennedy Jr., and sister Lauren Bessette
survived the crash of their small private plane off the coast of
Martha's Vineyard on July 16.
</P>
<P>
   The news media's focus has largely been on John's fate. But in
the eyes of the fashion world, it is Carolyn who was the undisputed
star, a fact John himself admitted with easy humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me use the same phrase that my father did when he went to
Paris with my mother 35 years ago,'' he told guests at an Italian
industry fashion dinner in 1997. ``My name is John Kennedy, and I
am the man who is accompanying Carolyn Bessette to Milan. I am

   NEW YORK _ Fashion appears to have lost its newest and brightest
fashion icon _ the only real successor to her mother-in-law,
Jacqueline Onassis.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities offer little hope that Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and
her husband, John F. Kennedy Jr., and sister Lauren Bessette
survived the crash of their small private plane off the coast of
Martha's Vineyard on July 16.
</P>
<P>
   The news media's focus has largely been on John's fate. But in
the eyes of the fashion world, it is Carolyn who was the undisputed
star, a fact John himself admitted with easy humor.

   ``Let me use the same phrase that my father did when he went to
Paris with my mother 35 years ago,'' he told guests at an Italian
industry fashion dinner in 1997. ``My name is John Kennedy, and I
am the man who is accompanying Carolyn Bessette to Milan. I am
honored to tell you she is my wife.''

NETWORKS GO ALL-OUT FOR SOME INK, ANY INK, ON NEW SHOWS
</HEADLINE>
 By KEN PARISH PERKINS

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Network television, wounded from the hits it
has been taking for offering too much violence and too few people
of color, is washing off the sludge in preparation for its annual
media free-for-all, beginning on Tuesday when UPN unveils its new
season. That's not a great start, we know. But as any television
exec worth that high six-figure salary would remind you, this
annual summer meeting for TV critics is closer to a marathon than a
sprint.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's 15 days of new-series screenings, glitzy parties,
poolside interviews, around-the-clock schmoozing and enough
propaganda to choke a hippo. But then, what better opportunity to
impress an audience tipsy on tequila?
</P>
<P>
   ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox _ plus the three junior outlets UPN, the WB
and Pax TV _ will present rough cuts of their 1999-2000 fall
sitcoms, dramas and (on UPN) wrestling shows. They're hoping for
favorable previews, but they'll settle for attention, given that in
this town, bad publicity is still publicity.
</P>
<P>
   It is here where the giddiness of hope can turn into the
gestation of reality, and rather quickly, too. Two seasons ago,
newly hitched Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen arrived straight from
car-pooling chores to unveil the much-anticipated ``Ink.'' But the
sitcom was so despised by critics that it was completely retooled _
only to air and STILL be despised by viewers.
</P>
<P>
   On the other end was last season's shouting match between
then-unknown stand-up comedian D.L. Hughley and a black journalist
over what constitutes the ``black experience.'' Hughley was so
hilarious defending himself (it was like a comic hammering a
heckler) that journalists picked his ABC series, ``The Hughleys,''
as one of the season's sure-fire hits. The momentum helped the
comedy become a valuable commodity.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was Sammo Hung, the roly-poly Hong Kong actor
with the kung-fu grip. In a press conference that lasted well over
an hour, few understood a word he said, except that he had an
affinity for leaping over moving cars. But critics found his
humility refreshing and his naivete amusing. No wonder his
cartoonish ``Martial Law'' was given the benefit of the doubt, as
critics wrote glowingly about its guilty pleasures. Viewers tried
it, and the series is one of the few freshmen to return.
</P>
<P>
   It's early, but there looks to be no ``Felicity'' in the bunch
of 38 newcomers _ which is to say that no series has caught media
buzz sight unseen, deserved or not. Stepping out from the pack will
be harder this year, because there's an eerie sameness among the
new arrivals. There are more dramas than comedies (no network is
adding more than three sitcoms), more dramadies than in years past,
more shows set in high schools and more spinoffs. (''Party of
Five's'' Jennifer Love Hewitt is among those getting top billing on
a new show.)
</P>
<P>
   Most of the interest, as always, is focused on the dramas with
big-name pedigree. Foremost is ABC's ``Once Again,'' another
introspective talky show from thirtysomething and ``Relativity''
producers Ed Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz, starring Sela Ward
(''Sisters'') as a divorcee navigating a new romance.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's ``Wasteland,'' about twentysomethings dating in New York,
comes from ``Dawson's Creek'' producer and writer Kevin Williamson.
NBC's ``The West Wing,'' about a White House staff, co-stars Rob
Lowe and is produced by Aaron Sorkin of ``Sports Night.'' Fox's
supernatural ``Harsh Realm'' comes from ``The X-Files'''
mastermind, Chris Carter.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's David E. Kelley.
</P>
<P>
   He'll introduce two new series, ``Snoops,'' for ABC, about a
detective agency, and the Ally McBeal half-hour simply titled
``Ally,'' slated for Tuesdays on Fox. Maybe he'll reveal the
high-protein diet that will allow him to do those two shows PLUS
write ``Ally McBeal'' and ``The Practice,'' and oversee a revamped
``Chicago Hope.''
</P>
<P>
   On the comedy side, Fox's ``Action,'' starring Jay Mohr (''Jerry
McGuire'') as a hustling film producer, is already generating
discussion for its gimmick: Profanity is used but bleeped out.
(Anyone who speaks English will probably pick up on the curse
words.) ``Stark Raving Mad,'' with Neil Patrick Harris (''Doogie
Howser, M.D.'') as a neurotic book agent working with an eccentric
author, will get notice by virtue of its time, day and network
(8:30 p.m. Thursdays, NBC.)
</P>
<P>
   Falling somewhere in the middle is the hour-long ``Freaks &AMP;
Geeks,'' which follows a group of adolescent outcasts circa 1980.
It's created by Judd Apatow, who has written for ``The Larry
Sanders Show'' and ``The Ben Stiller Show,'' and it heads a slew of
high-school clique shows.
</P>
<P>
   Morning host Bryant Gumbel will show up for CBS to explain why
he's doing what he said he'd never do again; Florence Henderson
will do the honors for NBC, with the network perhaps forced to
explain how the former Brady Bunch star ended up in the co-host
chair (along with the terrific Jodi Applegate) for the new ``Later
Today.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the time and place for networks to try desperate
measures of getting attention for programs they ``believe in,'' to
give their shows and stars an edge in a TV universe of too many
choices, too much Internet and way too much apathy.
</P>
<P>
   Press presentations, averaging $500,000 a pop, are staged
publicity events with food and drink. They're usually executed on a
silly, corny scale _ like the time UPN staged for critics a boring,
uneventful Dilbert game show, only to have its host say halfway
through, ``Are we done yet?''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to such over-the-top hype, each ``press tour,'' as
these gatherings are called, gets saddled with a prevalent theme or
two. This year, the two certain to emerge are violence and race. &QL; 
MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   The Columbine High School tragedy, where 14 students and a
teacher died in a flurry of gunfire, resurrected the question of
whether TV violence makes good kids go bad. As politicians elbowed
for air time to criticize the industry, networks responded by
pulling shows that had any hint of violence.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the much-hyped mob series ``Falcone'', starring Jason
Gedrick, won't be presented here because CBS felt uncomfortable
with the show's level of violence. (Another example of how cable
differs: HBO is proudly airing ``The Sopranos.'')
</P>
<P>
   As for race, well, television has long had its problems. But
never has a civil-rights group gone so far as to threaten legal
action to force more representation. Even if the lawsuit proposed
by the NAACP never makes it to court, which is likely, the measure
taken by the organization is further evidence that television is
failing to mirror the society it serves.
</P>
<P>
   None of the major networks has shows this season in which
Hispanics, Asians, African-Americans or American Indians dominate
or even share lead roles. There are more gay characters on TV this
season than Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   Even in ensemble series like NBC's drama ``Third Watch,'' which
focuses on paramedics, firefighters and cops, black characters are
pushed into the background. (Expect the networks to retool shows
and add people of color just to shut up critics.)
</P>
<P>
   Junior net UPN will screen two new shows with blacks: a series
fronted by Jaleel White (Urkel from ``Family Matters'') as a young
man finding his way in the working world, and Countess Vaughn, who
played Brandy's best friend in ``Moesha,'' starring in a
mother-daughter buddy comedy.
</P>
<P>
   New Entertainment President Susanne Daniels will have to address
the race issue at the WB, a network that will dump its three
remaining black-oriented series (''For Your Love,'' ``The Steve
Harvey Show,'' and ``The Jamie Foxx Show'') on Friday nights.

   During January's press tour, Daniels talked glowingly about the
WB's positioning as ``the network of young America.''
</P>
<P>
   With six new series for fall and none featuring a person of
color, we can finally ask Daniels: Do you mean young white America?

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fashion appears to have lost its newest and brightest
fashion icon _ the only real successor to her mother-in-law,
Jacqueline Onassis.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities offer little hope that Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and
her husband, John F. Kennedy Jr., and sister Lauren Bessette
survived the crash of their small private plane off the coast of
Martha's Vineyard on July 16.
</P>
<P>
   The news media's focus has largely been on John's fate. But in
the eyes of the fashion world, it is Carolyn who was the undisputed
star, a fact John himself admitted with easy humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me use the same phrase that my father did when he went to
Paris with my mother 35 years ago,'' he told guests at an Italian
industry fashion dinner in 1997. ``My name is John Kennedy, and I
am the man who is accompanying Carolyn Bessette to Milan. I am
honored to tell you she is my wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Bessette Kennedy has been a designer's dream: a striking
woman of easy, unstudied style who, along with her husband,
commanded a room the minute she walked in.
</P>
<P>
   A true clotheshorse, she was sighted regularly at Prada and
Barneys and gained recognition as diverse as a ``VH-1 Fashion
Awards'' nomination and an appearance on the ever-stodgy Best
Dressed list.
</P>
<P>
   ``She chooses simple, severe looks that not everyone would
wear,'' said Gucci's Tom Ford, reached over the weekend at his
apartment in Paris. ``She knows how to set off her beauty with
clothes. That's a rare gift.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford, like all the designers contacted Sunday, was insistent on
not talking about Bessette Kennedy in the past tense.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has the look of the '90s,'' said Karl Lagerfeld from the
Chanel atelier. ``She is not a label girl. Everything that she wore
looked fabulous on her.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Oscar de la Renta, who designed the dress Ethel Kennedy
was to wear for her daughter Rory's wedding: ``She is the
incarnation of modern style.''
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, Bessette Kennedy, with her piercing blue eyes and
silken blond mane, possessed an arresting beauty that many
characterized as uniquely American _ and uniquely contemporary.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Bessette first appeared on fashion's radar screen when
she worked at a Boston-area Calvin Klein boutique after graduating
from Boston University. It wasn't long before sharp-eyed executives
transferred her to the New York headquarters to be closer to the
action.
</P>
<P>
   There, her influence was disproportionate to her experience. She
was not only moving quickly in the office _ she had Calvin's ear
and his wife Kelly's friendship _ but out on the town as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has real street smarts,'' one observer remarked. ``She
knew what was going to be a trend long before anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Charming, intelligent and funny, Bessette could also be
mercurial and tough. Most importantly, she seemed indifferent to
celebrity _ making her ideal for her first assignment: assisting
VIPs in the showroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to be one of the things that attracted (Kennedy) to
her _ she had such repartee and such wit,'' said New York publicist
Paul Wilmot, who also worked at Calvin Klein back then. ``She had
just enough sense of sarcasm. All these things that seemed so
serious in the fashion world _ she would cut right through them.
From day one.''
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Klein, reached late Sunday afternoon, continued to
express hope about Bessette Kennedy, even as the news trickling out
of Martha's Vineyard remained relentlessly pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hopes and prayers are that they still will all be found
alive, and my thoughts are with Carolyn's family and the whole
Kennedy family,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1992 feature on up-and-coming New Yorkers, W magazine
described Bessette, then 25, with her ``mannequin proportions and
sultry blue-eyed beauty,'' as ``merely a physically blessed real
person. Sort of.'' Just recently promoted to the Collection
position at the time, she revealed how she decided against pursuing
a career in teaching despite majoring in elementary education in
college: ``At the time, I felt a little underdeveloped myself to be
completely responsible for 25 other people's children,'' she
explained. ``And to a large extent, I felt it wouldn't be
provocative enough for me.''
</P>
<P>
   John and Carolyn met not long after her arrival in New York,
though accounts differ as to the circumstances. One has them
meeting by chance during a Central Park jog. In others, Kelly Klein
plays matchmaker, introducing them either at a party or during a
showroom visit at Calvin Klein by the young Kennedy scion.
</P>
<P>
   The match wasn't immediate, however. Kennedy was dating Daryl
Hannah, and Carolyn was seeing Calvin Klein model Michael Bergin.
Besides, Bessette was a veteran party girl, while Kennedy, known to
ride to black-tie events on his bicycle, was more of an athletic
outdoorsman.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1994 the couple was an item. And while wildcat videos of
arguments between John and Carolyn replay continually on taboid TV
shows, the pair often seemed the very image of a loving couple when
together. He could appear protective of her in public settings, and
when they were seated at separate tables at a large benefit dinner,
he would frequently check that all was well.
</P>
<P>
   They could even be a little sappy. ``How're you doing,
honey-bunny?'' John asked her at a star-studded party at New York's
Asia de Cuba restaurant to celebrate the second anniversary of
George magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a long, black Yohji dress and ebony polished calf
Manolos, Bessette Kennedy stood with her husband at the party's
entrance for nearly two hours meeting and greeting guests ranging
from Lee Radziwill to Anne Heche to Ian Schrager. She had a word
for everyone _ even '70s rocker Ted Nugent who walked in wearing a
Ducks Unlimited cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be too hard on those ducks,'' she teased.
</P>
<P>
   While their public appearances together were rare _ any party
they went to automatically assumed the proportions of a major event
_ they were not entirely reclusive. They occasionally could be
spotted among the chic crowd at such eateries at TriBeCa's trendy
Independent, Greenwich Village's Il Cantinori or at the cozy NoLIta
bistro La Cigale.
</P>
<P>
   And when out of the public eye, they definitely knew how to do
casual. The week after Easter this spring, the couple stayed near
Vero Beach, Fla., at a house borrowed from financier Pete Peterson
while John took additional flying lessons at nearby Flight Safety,
where he had earned his pilot's license and was training for an
instrument-rating license.
</P>
<P>
   During the long weekend, the couple would head out to the local
cafe in shorts and sports sandals for an al fresco Breakfast. Her
famous blond hair was hidden beneath a bandanna, but otherwise they
blended in _ as much as America's most famous couple could be
inconspicuous. Bodyguards and large retinues were not their style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they were teachers of how to live with grace and style
and with being celebrities,'' Donna Karan said.
</P>
<P>
   That, particularly, did not come easily for Carolyn. Although
she handled her role as Kennedy wife extremely well, Bessette
Kennedy was clearly ambivalent about the hysteria that greeted her
engagement and then marriage to America's favorite bachelor.
</P>
<P>
   Bessette's wedding to Kennedy in 1996 was perhaps her first
major brush with the care she'd have to use to protect her private
life. A 50-member security team, hired at a cost of $250,000, began
coordinating with state troopers, the police and the National Park
Service five days in advance to provide safety and secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   Beaches and marinas within a 15-mile radius of Cumberland
Island, Ga., were watched, and all boats (or hikers) bound for the
island were turned away.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the couple honeymooned in Turkey and Greece, the rumor
mill kicked into high gear. The big question on the minds of the
publishing world was who would get her for their cover. The answer:
no one. Nor would she choose to add her name to a vanity list of
contributing editors or even grant interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Next, of course, came talk that she was pregnant, a rumor she
handled with typical skill and aplomb. At the 1997 premiere of
``Air Force One'' in Washington, Tommy Hilfiger and John were
passing around snacks. She declined an offer of Goobers, she told
Hilfiger, because if she indulged, the press would think she's
pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you pregnant?'' Hilfiger asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' she responded.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, Bessette Kennedy slipped away from the
crowd at another party to a secluded table and ordered a drink from
the waiter. When she took a cigarette from a guest at the party,
she glanced up with a wry smile and said, ``I guess you know this
means I'm not pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   Since her marriage, Bessette Kennedy had tried to avoid the
incessant media attention _ and not always successfully. Yet she
managed to find humor in the strangest of situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked into my grandmother's house one day and she was on
the phone talking to someone called Bambi,'' she once said in an
interview with WWD. ``I couldn't figure out who this Bambi was. `Oh
Bambi, I don't think that's true,' she was saying, and `Sure,
anytime you want, Bambi.' Finally she got off the phone and I said,
`Who's Bambi?' And she said, `Oh, Bambi's my friend from ``Hard
Copy.''' And, of course, she had no idea what `Hard Copy' was.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the same grandmother who was a trifle disappointed at
Carolyn and John's living arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few weeks after we moved into the loft, she came to visit,''
Carolyn remembered. ``She was unimpressed. `So you married this
famous man and you're in every newspaper and this is where you
live?''' she quoted her grandmother as saying.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Carolyn prided herself on not being an uptown girl.
When she first came to New York, she moved to the East Village,
long before it was the yuppie haven it has now become.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to step over drunks and crack dealers to get to my
apartment,'' she remembered. ``Everybody at Calvin thought I was
crazy, but I couldn't imagine coming to New York and living
anywhere else. Even with all the weirdness, I felt comfortable and
I had fun.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fashion appears to have lost its newest and brightest
fashion icon _ the only real successor to her mother-in-law,
Jacqueline Onassis.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities offer little hope that Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and
her husband, John F. Kennedy Jr., and sister Lauren Bessette
survived the crash of their small private plane off the coast of
Martha's Vineyard on July 16.
</P>
<P>
   The news media's focus has largely been on John's fate. But in
the eyes of the fashion world, it is Carolyn who was the undisputed
star, a fact John himself admitted with easy humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me use the same phrase that my father did when he went to
Paris with my mother 35 years ago,'' he told guests at an Italian
industry fashion dinner in 1997. ``My name is John Kennedy, and I
am the man who is accompanying Carolyn Bessette to Milan. I am
honored to tell you she is my wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Bessette Kennedy has been a designer's dream: a striking
woman of easy, unstudied style who, along with her husband,
commanded a room the minute she walked in.
</P>
<P>
   A true clotheshorse, she was sighted regularly at Prada and
Barneys and gained recognition as diverse as a ``VH-1 Fashion
Awards'' nomination and an appearance on the ever-stodgy Best
Dressed list.
</P>
<P>
   ``She chooses simple, severe looks that not everyone would
wear,'' said Gucci's Tom Ford, reached over the weekend at his
apartment in Paris. ``She knows how to set off her beauty with
clothes. That's a rare gift.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford, like all the designers contacted Sunday, was insistent on
not talking about Bessette Kennedy in the past tense.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has the look of the '90s,'' said Karl Lagerfeld from the
Chanel atelier. ``She is not a label girl. Everything that she wore
looked fabulous on her.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Oscar de la Renta, who designed the dress Ethel Kennedy
was to wear for her daughter Rory's wedding: ``She is the
incarnation of modern style.''
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, Bessette Kennedy, with her piercing blue eyes and
silken blond mane, possessed an arresting beauty that many
characterized as uniquely American _ and uniquely contemporary.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Bessette first appeared on fashion's radar screen when
she worked at a Boston-area Calvin Klein boutique after graduating
from Boston University. It wasn't long before sharp-eyed executives
transferred her to the New York headquarters to be closer to the
action.
</P>
<P>
   There, her influence was disproportionate to her experience. She
was not only moving quickly in the office _ she had Calvin's ear
and his wife Kelly's friendship _ but out on the town as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has real street smarts,'' one observer remarked. ``She
knew what was going to be a trend long before anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Charming, intelligent and funny, Bessette could also be
mercurial and tough. Most importantly, she seemed indifferent to
celebrity _ making her ideal for her first assignment: assisting
VIPs in the showroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to be one of the things that attracted (Kennedy) to
her _ she had such repartee and such wit,'' said New York publicist
Paul Wilmot, who also worked at Calvin Klein back then. ``She had
just enough sense of sarcasm. All these things that seemed so
serious in the fashion world _ she would cut right through them.
From day one.''
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Klein, reached late Sunday afternoon, continued to
express hope about Bessette Kennedy, even as the news trickling out
of Martha's Vineyard remained relentlessly pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hopes and prayers are that they still will all be found
alive, and my thoughts are with Carolyn's family and the whole
Kennedy family,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1992 feature on up-and-coming New Yorkers, W magazine
described Bessette, then 25, with her ``mannequin proportions and
sultry blue-eyed beauty,'' as ``merely a physically blessed real
person. Sort of.'' Just recently promoted to the Collection
position at the time, she revealed how she decided against pursuing
a career in teaching despite majoring in elementary education in
college: ``At the time, I felt a little underdeveloped myself to be
completely responsible for 25 other people's children,'' she
explained. ``And to a large extent, I felt it wouldn't be
provocative enough for me.''
</P>
<P>
   John and Carolyn met not long after her arrival in New York,
though accounts differ as to the circumstances. One has them
meeting by chance during a Central Park jog. In others, Kelly Klein
plays matchmaker, introducing them either at a party or during a
showroom visit at Calvin Klein by the young Kennedy scion.
</P>
<P>
   The match wasn't immediate, however. Kennedy was dating Daryl
Hannah, and Carolyn was seeing Calvin Klein model Michael Bergin.
Besides, Bessette was a veteran party girl, while Kennedy, known to
ride to black-tie events on his bicycle, was more of an athletic
outdoorsman.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1994 the couple was an item. And while wildcat videos of
arguments between John and Carolyn replay continually on taboid TV
shows, the pair often seemed the very image of a loving couple when
together. He could appear protective of her in public settings, and
when they were seated at separate tables at a large benefit dinner,
he would frequently check that all was well.
</P>
<P>
   They could even be a little sappy. ``How're you doing,
honey-bunny?'' John asked her at a star-studded party at New York's
Asia de Cuba restaurant to celebrate the second anniversary of
George magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a long, black Yohji dress and ebony polished calf
Manolos, Bessette Kennedy stood with her husband at the party's
entrance for nearly two hours meeting and greeting guests ranging
from Lee Radziwill to Anne Heche to Ian Schrager. She had a word
for everyone _ even '70s rocker Ted Nugent who walked in wearing a
Ducks Unlimited cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be too hard on those ducks,'' she teased.
</P>
<P>
   While their public appearances together were rare _ any party
they went to automatically assumed the proportions of a major event
_ they were not entirely reclusive. They occasionally could be
spotted among the chic crowd at such eateries at TriBeCa's trendy
Independent, Greenwich Village's Il Cantinori or at the cozy NoLIta
bistro La Cigale.
</P>
<P>
   And when out of the public eye, they definitely knew how to do
casual. The week after Easter this spring, the couple stayed near
Vero Beach, Fla., at a house borrowed from financier Pete Peterson
while John took additional flying lessons at nearby Flight Safety,
where he had earned his pilot's license and was training for an
instrument-rating license.
</P>
<P>
   During the long weekend, the couple would head out to the local
cafe in shorts and sports sandals for an al fresco Breakfast. Her
famous blond hair was hidden beneath a bandanna, but otherwise they
blended in _ as much as America's most famous couple could be
inconspicuous. Bodyguards and large retinues were not their style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they were teachers of how to live with grace and style
and with being celebrities,'' Donna Karan said.
</P>
<P>
   That, particularly, did not come easily for Carolyn. Although
she handled her role as Kennedy wife extremely well, Bessette
Kennedy was clearly ambivalent about the hysteria that greeted her
engagement and then marriage to America's favorite bachelor.
</P>
<P>
   Bessette's wedding to Kennedy in 1996 was perhaps her first
major brush with the care she'd have to use to protect her private
life. A 50-member security team, hired at a cost of $250,000, began
coordinating with state troopers, the police and the National Park
Service five days in advance to provide safety and secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   Beaches and marinas within a 15-mile radius of Cumberland
Island, Ga., were watched, and all boats (or hikers) bound for the
island were turned away.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the couple honeymooned in Turkey and Greece, the rumor
mill kicked into high gear. The big question on the minds of the
publishing world was who would get her for their cover. The answer:
no one. Nor would she choose to add her name to a vanity list of
contributing editors or even grant interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Next, of course, came talk that she was pregnant, a rumor she
handled with typical skill and aplomb. At the 1997 premiere of
``Air Force One'' in Washington, Tommy Hilfiger and John were
passing around snacks. She declined an offer of Goobers, she told
Hilfiger, because if she indulged, the press would think she's
pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you pregnant?'' Hilfiger asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' she responded.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, Bessette Kennedy slipped away from the
crowd at another party to a secluded table and ordered a drink from
the waiter. When she took a cigarette from a guest at the party,
she glanced up with a wry smile and said, ``I guess you know this
means I'm not pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   Since her marriage, Bessette Kennedy had tried to avoid the
incessant media attention _ and not always successfully. Yet she
managed to find humor in the strangest of situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked into my grandmother's house one day and she was on
the phone talking to someone called Bambi,'' she once said in an
interview with WWD. ``I couldn't figure out who this Bambi was. `Oh
Bambi, I don't think that's true,' she was saying, and `Sure,
anytime you want, Bambi.' Finally she got off the phone and I said,
`Who's Bambi?' And she said, `Oh, Bambi's my friend from ``Hard
Copy.''' And, of course, she had no idea what `Hard Copy' was.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the same grandmother who was a trifle disappointed at
Carolyn and John's living arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few weeks after we moved into the loft, she came to visit,''
Carolyn remembered. ``She was unimpressed. `So you married this
famous man and you're in every newspaper and this is where you
live?''' she quoted her grandmother as saying.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Carolyn prided herself on not being an uptown girl.
When she first came to New York, she moved to the East Village,
long before it was the yuppie haven it has now become.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to step over drunks and crack dealers to get to my
apartment,'' she remembered. ``Everybody at Calvin thought I was
crazy, but I couldn't imagine coming to New York and living
anywhere else. Even with all the weirdness, I felt comfortable and
I had fun.''

   But mostly, Bessette Kennedy, with her piercing blue eyes and
silken blond mane, possessed an arresting beauty that many
characterized as uniquely American _ and uniquely contemporary.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Bessette first appeared on fashion's radar screen when
she worked at a Boston-area Calvin Klein boutique after graduating
from Boston University. It wasn't long before sharp-eyed executives
transferred her to the New York headquarters to be closer to the
action.
</P>
<P>
   There, her influence was disproportionate to her experience. She
was not only moving quickly in the office _ she had Calvin's ear
and his wife Kelly's friendship _ but out on the town as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has real street smarts,'' one observer remarked. ``She
knew what was going to be a trend long before anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Charming, intelligent and funny, Bessette could also be
mercurial and tough. Most importantly, she seemed indifferent to
celebrity _ making her ideal for her first assignment: assisting
VIPs in the showroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to be one of the things that attracted (Kennedy) to
her _ she had such repartee and such wit,'' said New York publicist
Paul Wilmot, who also worked at Calvin Klein back then. ``She had
just enough sense of sarcasm. All these things that seemed so
serious in the fashion world _ she would cut right through them.
From day one.''
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Klein, reached late Sunday afternoon, continued to
express hope about Bessette Kennedy, even as the news trickling out
of Martha's Vineyard remained relentlessly pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hopes and prayers are that they still will all be found
alive, and my thoughts are with Carolyn's family and the whole
Kennedy family,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1992 feature on up-and-coming New Yorkers, W magazine
described Bessette, then 25, with her ``mannequin proportions and
sultry blue-eyed beauty,'' as ``merely a physically blessed real
person. Sort of.'' Just recently promoted to the Collection
position at the time, she revealed how she decided against pursuing
a career in teaching despite majoring in elementary education in
college: ``At the time, I felt a little underdeveloped myself to be
completely responsible for 25 other people's children,'' she
explained. ``And to a large extent, I felt it wouldn't be
provocative enough for me.''
</P>
<P>
   John and Carolyn met not long after her arrival in New York,
though accounts differ as to the circumstances. One has them
meeting by chance during a Central Park jog. In others, Kelly Klein
plays matchmaker, introducing them either at a party or during a
showroom visit at Calvin Klein by the young Kennedy scion.
</P>
<P>
   The match wasn't immediate, however. Kennedy was dating Daryl
Hannah, and Carolyn was seeing Calvin Klein model Michael Bergin.
Besides, Bessette was a veteran party girl, while Kennedy, known to
ride to black-tie events on his bicycle, was more of an athletic
outdoorsman.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1994 the couple was an item. And while wildcat videos of
arguments between John and Carolyn replay continually on taboid TV
shows, the pair often seemed the very image of a loving couple when
together. He could appear protective of her in public settings, and
when they were seated at separate tables at a large benefit dinner,
he would frequently check that all was well.
</P>
<P>
   They could even be a little sappy. ``How're you doing,
honey-bunny?'' John asked her at a star-studded party at New York's
Asia de Cuba restaurant to celebrate the second anniversary of
George magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a long, black Yohji dress and ebony polished calf
Manolos, Bessette Kennedy stood with her husband at the party's
entrance for nearly two hours meeting and greeting guests ranging
from Lee Radziwill to Anne Heche to Ian Schrager. She had a word
for everyone _ even '70s rocker Ted Nugent who walked in wearing a
Ducks Unlimited cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be too hard on those ducks,'' she teased.
</P>
<P>
   While their public appearances together were rare _ any party
they went to automatically assumed the proportions of a major event
_ they were not entirely reclusive. They occasionally could be
spotted among the chic crowd at such eateries at TriBeCa's trendy
Independent, Greenwich Village's Il Cantinori or at the cozy NoLIta
bistro La Cigale.
</P>
<P>
   And when out of the public eye, they definitely knew how to do
casual. The week after Easter this spring, the couple stayed near
Vero Beach, Fla., at a house borrowed from financier Pete Peterson
while John took additional flying lessons at nearby Flight Safety,
where he had earned his pilot's license and was training for an
instrument-rating license.
</P>
<P>
   During the long weekend, the couple would head out to the local
cafe in shorts and sports sandals for an al fresco Breakfast. Her
famous blond hair was hidden beneath a bandanna, but otherwise they
blended in _ as much as America's most famous couple could be
inconspicuous. Bodyguards and large retinues were not their style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they were teachers of how to live with grace and style
and with being celebrities,'' Donna Karan said.
</P>
<P>
   That, particularly, did not come easily for Carolyn. Although
she handled her role as Kennedy wife extremely well, Bessette
Kennedy was clearly ambivalent about the hysteria tht greeted her
engagement and then marriage to America's favorite bachelor.
</P>
<P>
   Bessette's wedding to Kennedy in 1996 was perhaps her first
major brush with the care she'd have to use to protect her private
life. A 50-member security team, hired at a cost of $250,000, began
coordinating with state troopers, the police and the National Park
Service five days in advance to provide safety and secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   Beaches and marinas within a 15-mile radius of Cumberland
Island, Ga., were watched, and all boats (or hikers) bound for the
island were turned away.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the couple honeymooned in Turkey and Greece, the rumor
mill kicked into high gear. The big question on the minds of the
publishing world was who would get her for their cover. The answer:
no one. Nor would she choose to add her name to a vanity list of
contributing editors or even grant interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Next, of course, came talk that she was pregnant, a rumor she
handled with typical skill and aplomb. At the 1997 premiere of
``Air Force One'' in Washington, Tommy Hilfiger and John were
passing around snacks. She declined an offer of Goobers, she told
Hilfiger, because if she indulged, the press would think she's
pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you pregnant?'' Hilfiger asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' she responded.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, Bessette Kennedy slipped away from the
crowd at another party to a secluded table and ordered a drink from
the waiter. When she took a cigarette from a guest at the party,
she glanced up with a wry smile and said, ``I guess you know this
means I'm not pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   Since her marriage, Bessette Kennedy had tried to avoid the
incessant media attention _ and not always successfully. Yet she
managed to find humor in the strangest of situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked into my grandmother's house one day and she was on
the phone talking to someone called Bambi,'' she once said in an
interview with WWD. ``I couldn't figure out who this Bambi was. `Oh
Bambi, I don't think that's true,' she was saying, and `Sure,
anytime you want, Bambi.' Finally she got off the phone and I said,
`Who's Bambi?' And she said, `Oh, Bambi's my friend from ``Hard
Copy.''' And, of course, she had no idea what `Hard Copy' was.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the same grandmother who was a trifle disappointed at
Carolyn and John's living arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few weeks after we moved into the loft, she came to visit,''
Carolyn remembered. ``She was unimpressed. `So you married this
famous man and you're in every newspaper and this is where you
live?''' she quoted her grandmother as saying.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Carolyn prided herself on not being an uptown girl.
When she first came to New York, she moved to the Est Village,
long before it was the yuppie haven it has now become.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to step over drunks and crack dealers to get to my
apartment,'' she remembered. ``Everybody at Calvin thought I was
crazy, but I couldn't imagine coming to New York and living
anywhere else. Even with all the weirdness, I felt comfortable and
I had fun.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fashion appears to have lost its newest and brightest
fashion icon _ the only real successor to her mother-in-law,
Jacqueline Onassis.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities offer little hope that Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and
her husband, John F. Kennedy Jr., and sister Lauren Bessette
survived the crash of their small private plane off the coast of
Martha's Vineyard on July 16.
</P>
<P>
   The news media's focus has largely been on John's fate. But in
the eyes of the fashion world, it is Carolyn who was the undisputed
star, a fact John himself admitted with easy humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me use the same phrase that my father did when he went to
Paris with my mother 35 years ago,'' he told guests at an Italian
industry fashion dinner in 1997. ``My name is John Kennedy, and I
am the man who is accompanying Carolyn Bessette to Milan. I am
honored to tell you she is my wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Bessette Kennedy has been a designer's dream: a striking
woman of easy, unstudied style who, along with her husband,
commanded a room the minute she walked in.
</P>
<P>
   A true clotheshorse, she was sighted regularly at Prada and
Barneys and gained recognition as diverse as a ``VH-1 Fashion
Awards'' nomination and an appearance on the ever-stodgy Best
Dressed list.
</P>
<P>
   ``She chooses simple, severe looks that not everyone would
wear,'' said Gucci's Tom Ford, reached over the weekend at his
apartment in Paris. ``She knows how to set off her beauty with
clothes. That's a rare gift.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford, like all the designers contacted Sunday, was insistent on
not talking about Bessette Kennedy in the past tense.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has the look of the '90s,'' said Karl Lagerfeld from the
Chanel atelier. ``She is not a label girl. Everything that she wore
looked fabulous on her.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Oscar de la Renta, who designed the dress Ethel Kennedy
was to wear for her daughter Rory's wedding: ``She is the
incarnation of modern style.''
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, Bessette Kennedy, with her piercing blue eyes and
silken blond mane, possessed an arresting beauty that many
characterized as uniquely American _ and uniquely contemporary.
</P>
<P>

READING ABOUT WRITING FOR THE DOG DAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 25)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   We now approach the sultry  &UR; dog days &LR;  of midsummer, so called
because they are marked by the heliacal rise of Sirius, the Dog
Star. (I often say to my dogs when they prance about in glee, ``Be
Sirius.'' Sorry, there are no  &UR; cat days &LR; .)
</P>
<P>
   Time for a survey of word books to take to the virtual beach.
</P>
<P>
   The more lighthearted first: ``Never Let a Fool Kiss You or a
Kiss Fool You,'' by Dr. Mardy Grothe, subtitled ``Chi-as-mus
(ky-AZ-mus)  &UR; n &LR; . a reversal in the order of words in two otherwise
parallel phrases'' (Viking paperback, $17.95).
</P>
<P>
   Those of us hooked on JFK's ``Ask not what you can do for your
country, ask what your country can do for you'' (I may have that
mixed up _ it's been a long time) can find delight in this overdue
collection. Mae West coined, ``It's better to be looked over than
to be overlooked''; William Hazlitt noted, ``It is the business of
reviewers to watch poets, not of poets to watch reviewers,'' and
Henny Youngman observed chiasmatically, ``Most marriage failures
are caused by failures marrying.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Word Circus,'' by Richard Lederer (part of Merriam-Webster's
``Lighter Side of Language'' series, $15). For your cell homophone,
try, ``One night a knight on a hoarse horse rode out upon the
road.'' Anagrammarians will learn the relationship among  &UR; parental,
paternal &LR;  and  &UR; prenatal &LR; . Palindromedaries will answer the question
``So there won't be a lion performance today?'' with: ``No, sit!
Cat act is on.'' (Be Sirius.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Ladyfingers and Nun's Tummies,'' by Martha Barnette (Vintage
paperback, $12). Where do food names come from? The coiled pastry
the Germans called  &UR; Schnecke &LR;  translates as ``snail.'' High-fiber
cereal eaters and Metamucil drinkers read  &UR; psyllium &LR;  on the label,
from the Greek  &UR; psulla &LR; , or ``flea,'' because its tiny seeds swell
and become gelatinous when moist. (Do fleas do that? I'm scratching
my head.)  &UR; Plum &LR;  has long been a synonym for ``raisin,'' which is
why you find no plums in plum pudding. And the derivation of
 &UR; pumpernickel &LR;  is devilishly windy.
</P>
<P>
   It works the other way around, too:  &UR; flummery &LR; , ``deceptive
language,'' comes from the Welsh  &UR; llymru, &LR;  ``a kind of soft jelly
made from sour oatmeal,'' often served with great elan by
candidates for office.
</P>
<P>
   With studied sophistication, I just slipped in a word _  &UR; elan &LR; ,
``vigor, spirit,'' from  &UR; lancer &LR; , ``to hurl'' _ we stole from the
French. (Affected?  &UR; Moi &LR; ?) This is by way of turning to weightier
but no less entertaining word fare.
</P>
<P>
   The Oxford Dictionary of Foreign Words and Phrases (fat
paperback, $12). Beyond  &UR; lese-majeste &LR;  (disrespectful presumption),
beyond  &UR; annus horribilis &LR;  (awful year) and beyond  &UR; Zeitgeist &LR; 
(spirit of the age) lie  &UR; nosh &LR;  (nibble greedily) and  &UR; mot de
Cambronne &LR; . Pierre Cambronne, the French general who refused to
surrender at the Battle of Waterloo, denied delivering the famous
line ``The Guard dies, but never surrenders''; what the Napoleonic
diehard probably said was  &UR; merde &LR; !, a scatological epithet embraced
by Ernest Hemingway, which has been euphemized to  &UR; mot de
Cambronne &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Though  &UR; Schadenfreude &LR;  (``malicious enjoyment of another's
misfortune'') can be found here, missing from this most useful
dictionary is  &UR; Endzeitstimmung &LR; , for ``the pervasive mood in the
mind of the public that a regime is coming to an end.'' That
definition does not quite do the German word justice; the closest
English metaphoric approximation is  &UR; circling the drain &LR; . Look for
increasing frequency of usage in the coming year and inclusion in
the next edition.
</P>
<P>
   The Dictionary of Computing and Digital Media, by Brad Hansen
(ABF Content, apparently a publisher in Wilsonville, Ore., run by
content providers afflicted with initialese, $34), is catnip for
netties. Does Miss Manners know that good  &UR; Netiquette &LR;  calls for
lines fewer than 70 characters long?
</P>
<P>
   This lexicon has all the heavy  &UR; square-pixel digitizing &LR;  you
will ever need, but is enlivened by such items as  &UR; squirt the
bird &LR; , which means ``direct a signal toward a telecommunications
satellite.'' (Note to the chiasmus collector: You squirt the bird
before the bird squirts you.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Electric Language: A Philosophical Study of Word Processing,''
by Michael Heim (Yale, $18). This is the second edition of a
pioneering work written in the Dark Ages (1987). It deals with
``the impact of word processing on the human thought process'' _
put more simply, which this book never does, how the new way we

NETWORKS GO ALL-OUT FOR SOME INK, ANY INK, ON NEW SHOWS
</HEADLINE>

(For use by NYTimes News Service Clients)

<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Network television, wounded from the hits it
has been taking for offering too much violence and too few people
of color, is washing off the sludge in preparation for its annual
media free-for-all, beginning on Tuesday when UPN unveils its new
season. That's not a great start, we know. But as any television
exec worth that high six-figure salary would remind you, this
annual summer meeting for TV critics is closer to a marathon than a
sprint.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's 15 days of new-series screenings, glitzy parties,
poolside interviews, around-the-clock schmoozing and enough
propaganda to choke a hippo. But then, what better opportunity to
impress an audience tipsy on tequila?
</P>
<P>
   ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox _ plus the three junior outlets UPN, the WB
and Pax TV _ will present rough cuts of their 1999-2000 fall
sitcoms, dramas and (on UPN) wrestling shows. They're hoping for
favorable previews, but they'll settle for attention, given that in
this town, bad publicity is still publicity.
</P>
<P>
   It is here where the giddiness of hope can turn into the
gestation of reality, and rather quickly, too. Two seasons ago,
newly hitched Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen arrived straight from
car-pooling chores to unveil the much-anticipated ``Ink.'' But the
sitcom was so despised by critics that it was completely retooled _
only to air and STILL be despised by viewers.
</P>
<P>
   On the other end was last season's shouting match between
then-unknown stand-up comedian D.L. Hughley and a black journalist
over what constitutes the ``black experience.'' Hughley was so
hilarious defending himself (it was like a comic hammering a
heckler) that journalists picked his ABC series, ``The Hughleys,''
as one of the season's sure-fire hits. The momentum helped the
comedy become a valuable commodity.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was Sammo Hung, the roly-poly Hong Kong actor
with the kung-fu grip. In a press conference that lasted well over
an hour, few understood a word he said, except that he had an
affinity for leaping over moving cars. But critics found his
humility refreshing and his naivete amusing. No wonder his
cartoonish ``Martial Law'' was given the benefit of the doubt, as
critics wrote glowingly about its guilty pleasures. Viewers tried
it, and the series is one of the few freshmen to return.
</P>
<P>
   It's early, but there looks to be no ``Felicity'' in the bunch
of 38 newcomers _ which is to say that no series has caught media
buzz sight unseen, deserved or not. Stepping out from the pack will
be harder this year, because there's an eerie sameness among the
new arrivals. There are more dramas than comedies (no network is
adding more than three sitcoms), more dramadies than in years past,
more shows set in high schools and more spinoffs. (''Party of
Five's'' Jennifer Love Hewitt is among those getting top billing on
a new show.)
</P>
<P>
   Most of the interest, as always, is focused on the dramas with
big-name pedigree. Foremost is ABC's ``Once Again,'' another
introspective talky show from thirtysomething and ``Relativity''
producers Ed Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz, starring Sela Ward
(''Sisters'') as a divorcee navigating a new romance.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's ``Wasteland,'' about twentysomethings dating in New York,
comes from ``Dawson's Creek'' producer and writer Kevin Williamson.
NBC's ``The West Wing,'' about a White House staff, co-stars Rob
Lowe and is produced by Aaron Sorkin of ``Sports Night.'' Fox's
supernatural ``Harsh Realm'' comes from ``The X-Files'''
mastermind, Chris Carter.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's David E. Kelley.
</P>
<P>
   He'll introduce two new series, ``Snoops,'' for ABC, about a
detective agency, and the Ally McBeal half-hour simply titled
``Ally,'' slated for Tuesdays on Fox. Maybe he'll reveal the
high-protein diet that will allow him to do those two shows PLUS
write ``Ally McBeal'' and ``The Practice,'' and oversee a revamped
``Chicago Hope.''
</P>
<P>
   On the comedy side, Fox's ``Action,'' starring Jay Mohr (''Jerry
McGuire'') as a hustling film producer, is already generating
discussion for its gimmick: Profanity is used but bleeped out.
(Anyone who speaks English will probably pick up on the curse
words.) ``Stark Raving Mad,'' with Neil Patrick Harris (''Doogie
Howser, M.D.'') as a neurotic book agent working with an eccentric
author, will get notice by virtue of its time, day and network
(8:30 p.m. Thursdays, NBC.)
</P>
<P>
   Falling somewhere in the middle is the hour-long ``Freaks &AMP;
Geeks,'' which follows a group of adolescent outcasts circa 1980.
It's created by Judd Apatow, who has written for ``The Larry
Sanders Show'' and ``The Ben Stiller Show,'' and it heads a slew of
high-school clique shows.
</P>
<P>
   Morning host Bryant Gumbel will show up for CBS to explain why
he's doing what he said he'd never do again; Florence Henderson
will do the honors for NBC, with the network perhaps forced to
explain how the former Brady Bunch star ended up in the co-host
chair (along with the terrific Jodi Applegate) for the new ``Later
Today.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the time and place for networks to try desperate
measures of getting attention for programs they ``believe in,'' to
give their shows and stars an edge in a TV universe of too many
choices, too much Internet and way too much apathy.
</P>
<P>
   Press presentations, averaging $500,000 a pop, are staged
publicity events with food and drink. They're usually executed on a
silly, corny scale _ like the time UPN staged for critics a boring,
uneventful Dilbert game show, only to have its host say halfway
through, ``Are we done yet?''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to such over-the-top hype, each ``press tour,'' as
these gatherings are called, gets saddled with a prevalent theme or
two. This year, the two certain to emerge are violence and race. &QL;

TENNIS CHARMER PREFERS LIFE OUT OF THE LIMELIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHELLE SMITH  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It's amazing that the girl who always stood out
because she was 6-feet-2-inches in sneakers can manage to hide so
well in a professional women's tennis tournament.
</P>
<P>
   While the press busies itself chasing stories about Martina
Hingis' temper, Anna Kournikova's love life and Venus Williams'
father, Lindsay Davenport plays, wins, packs her duffel and makes
her way, unimpeded, to the next match.
</P>
<P>
   At least until the quarterfinals or so when someone figures out
that she is the story.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport is no longer merely a top-tier talent with one
she-must've-gotten-lucky Grand Slam win under her belt. A second
Slam victory, on the hallowed Centre Court of Wimbledon, gives her
career a superstar legitimacy that's been there for at least the
last 18 months, but everyone's been too preoccupied elsewhere to
notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many players now, with their own personality and
attitude. I really let my tennis do the talking,'' Davenport said
in a conference call previewing the Bank of the West Classic, which
begins July 26 at Taube Family Tennis Stadium on the Stanford
Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport does get recognized on the street and at the mall. Her
stature alone is enough to turn heads. But there's a distinct lack
of paparazzi in her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I look at it, I really do get enough attention. I'd
rather be the player who, on Monday, is getting all the press for
winning rather than whether I threw a tirade the first week or
where I went for dinner,'' Davenport said. ``I hope things don't
change.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be a tough wish to grant. Davenport's victory over
Steffi Graf on the grass at Wimbledon secured the world's No. 1
ranking. It's Davenport's second time at the top. At the end of the
1998 season, after she ended Hingis' 80- week reign, Davenport
became the first American-born player to be No. 1 since Chris Evert
in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best part of being No. 1 is there's nobody better than you
in the whole wide world,'' Davenport said.
</P>
<P>
   And it's hard to tell if she's talking tongue-in-cheek or with
wide-eyed enthusiasm. It certainly isn't arrogance. And it's rooted
in fact.
</P>
<P>
   The origins of her tenure atop the WTA rankings began last July
at Stanford when Davenport defeated Graf in the Bank of the West
final and went on to win the next two Southern California tour
spots, followed by the U.S. Open, her first Grand Slam victory. She
had a run last season in which she reached the finals in 11 of 12
tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's fully capable of winning any title now,'' said
television tennis analyst Mary Carillo. ``Winning Wimbledon was
huge. It was her worst surface, and she really moved down a strong
field.''
</P>
<P>
   Carillo calls Davenport ``aggressively normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport generates interest because of her play on the court,
which is a novel concept in the women's game these days.
</P>
<P>
   She invites neither tabloid reporters nor controversy, there is
not an overbearing parent in sight, and she seems to be above the
fray when it comes to both on-the-court rivalries and locker-room
trivialities. In fact, she has taken a leadership role among her
peers, serving on the WTA's Player's Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's surrounded by haughty divas and aging superstars,''
Carillo said. ``People who really like the sport and aren't
interested in stupid headlines and subplots are very happy for her
success and really want to see her win.''
</P>
<P>
   Carillo calls it ``The Jan Brady Syndrome.'' Yes, a reference to
the 1970s TV character on ``The Brady Bunch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the middle child, the one that always got overlooked,''
Carillo said. ``She's got the young starlets on one side and the
older players like Steffi and Monica (Seles) on the other. She's
suffered it all very well. She understands her place, and she's
very comfortable there.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's because it has taken the 23-year-old better than
six years on tour to reach an apex.
</P>
<P>
   When the Newport Beach native started as a pro, Hingis was a
pre-teen prodigy and Kournikova was still too young to be dating an
NHL hockey star. The early days of Davenport's career were marked
by awkwardness and inconsistency as both her body and her court
presence continued to grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that I look back, it was all a blessing,'' said Davenport,
who has trimmed from 205 pounds to 175 in the last two years,
improving both her footwork and her quickness. ``It helped my game
and shaped my confidence. I couldn't be happier that I'm tall.''
</P>
<P>
   She's also appreciative of her successes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people out there who say that if you don't win as a
teen-ager, you're no good,'' Davenport said. ``I just laugh at
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have no idea when somebody is going to develop. I'm more
mature, I think I handle it better, and I've just enjoyed it so
much. With two Grand Slams and a (Olympic) gold medal, I don't
think I could have scripted it any better.''

MAN LANDED ON THE MOON 30 YEARS AGO, BUT POP CULUTRE GOT THERE MUCH
EARLIER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thirty years ago Tuesday, Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and
Michael Collins went where no man had gone before _ at least
physically _ when they landed on the moon during the Apollo 11
mission.
</P>
<P>
   Pop culture, impatient and transient thing that it is, got there
way ahead of them and has been going back ever since.
</P>
<P>
   It comes as no surprise to find that Jules Verne wrote about a
moon landing way back in the 19th century, or that H.G. Wells wrote
his version decades before the actual event. It's a bit more
surprising to discover that someone called Luciano of Samosato
described a fictional visit in the second century. Dante, Cyrano de
Bergerac and Edgar Allan Poe also wrote of moon visits.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, these pre-20th-century authors weren't talking about
the moon landing, the one on July 20, 1969. But trying to nail down
just how that one landing fits in with pop culture isn't easy. Moon
landings, though, are prevalent in movies, pop music, TV and books.
</P>
<P>
   One of the earliest movies was George Melies' A Trip to the
Moon, a 1902 short that's getting a rare TV airing at 7 tonight
(CDT) on Turner Classic Movies (it's not available on video, so set
your VCR). But cinematic science-fiction didn't really blast off
until 1950's Destination Moon, a lunar-mission saga that TCM will
air at 9 p.m. CDT. Although Destination looks dated now, it was
impressive enough in its time that it won an Oscar for special
effects. Since Destination, movie examinations of moon landings
have ranged from campy (1954's Cat Women of the Moon) to serious
(Countdown, an early Robert Altman effort that predated the actual
landing by a year). TCM will air a couple of other examples from
the genre tonight, with the 1958 Joseph Cotten vehicle From the
Earth to the Moon at 7:15 p.m. and the 1963 satire The Mouse on the
Moon at 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   From the Earth to the Moon, coincidentally, is also the title of
a Tom Hanks-produced HBO miniseries about the space program. HBO is
currently rerunning the series, which is television's answer to the
much shorter 1989 documentary For All Mankind, also about the
Apollo missions (we're not counting Apollo 13 in our list here,
since it was about a later mission). But not all cinematic lunar
exploration has been this direct. Movies have also made peripheral
references to the moon landing, such as in this year's little-seen
romantic drama A Walk on the Moon, in which Diane Lane has an
extramarital affair against a backdrop of the lunar landing. And
Capricorn One, an out-of-control 1978 thriller about a faked Mars
landing, played on some folks' belief that the real moon landing
was a hoax.
</P>
<P>
   R.E.M. lead singer Michael Stipe is apparently one of the
doubters, because in the 1992 Andy Kaufman-tribute song Man on the
Moon, he sings, ``If you believed they put a man on the moon ...
then nothing is cool.'' The video for the song aired ad nauseam on
MTV, which used a moon-landing shot as its logo for years and
honors MTV Video Music Award winners with a moon-landing trophy
(''Thanks for the space guy,'' said Stone Temple Pilots lead singer
Scott Weiland when accepting the Best New Artist award in 1993).
Michael Jackson became a megastar doing his dance, the moonwalk, on
MTV, and Smashing Pumpkins borrowed from Melies' A Trip to the Moon
for their video for Tonight, but the Police's minor hit Walking on
the Moon was released too early for the MTV craze. Nit-pickers will
note that we omitted such space-oriented songs as Tony Bennett's
Fly Me to the Moon and David Bowie's Space Oddity, but that's
because neither of these songs is actually about being on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   If the moon is big in tunes, it's also big in 'toons; it seems
as if just about every cartoon character has made at least one moon
trip. But the best animated lunar odyssey of all time has to be A
Grand Day Out, featuring Nick Park's Claymation creations Wallace
(an eccentric inventor) and Gromit (his loyal, long-suffering
canine companion). In Day, cheese-loving Wallace and Gromit, having
run out of their earthly cheese supply, build a rocket to travel to
the moon and enjoy its endless supply of cheese. Park, probably
best-known for his talking-car commercials for Chevron, received an
Oscar nomination for this; if you haven't seen it, rent it.
</P>
<P>
   If you'd rather not tune in to tunes or 'toons about the moon,
you can always spend a quiet night reading, because books about the
moon landing didn't end with Wells and Verne. The myriad nonfiction
offerings include books by all three Apollo 11 astronauts, and
Aldrin has gone on to co-write science-fiction novels (an Apollo 11
photo autographed by Aldrin was a recent hot auction item on
Amazon.com). Several Web sites address the moon landing; one of the
most interesting we found is simply called ``Where Were You July
20, 1969?'' (www.wherewereyou.com/frames/home.html), which invited
cybersurfers to tell their stories about what happened to them on
lunar-landing day.

STALKED BY DEADLY VIRUS, AN ENGINEERED PAPAYA LIVES TO BREED
AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Hawaii)   (af)  
 By CAROL KAESUK YOON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the island of Hawaii, on what had been acres of withering,
disease-infested plants, farmers this summer are walking among rows
of lush green trees, harvesting the world's first crop of
genetically engineered papayas.
</P>
<P>
   Designed with a gene that allows them to withstand the papaya
ringspot virus _ an incurable disease that ruins fruit and can
sicken trees to the point of killing them _ these genetically
modified plants are already being credited with saving an industry
that was on its way out.
</P>
<P>
   In the past seven years as the virus wiped out farm after farm
in Hawaii's major papaya growing region, farmers continually sought
out new land in what became increasingly futile attempts to escape
the spreading disease. Some farmers grew so desperate that they
broke into experimental fields and stole genetically engineered
papaya seeds before they were approved for use by the Department of
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   ``This industry was dying,'' said Emerson Llantero, manager of
the Papaya Administrative Committee, a research and marketing group
supported by papaya farms, most of which are small, family
operations of 10 to 20 acres. The new papaya, he said, is a second
chance for growers.
</P>
<P>
   In an expanding debate over potential problems with genetically
engineered crops, from corn pollen that can kill monarch
butterflies to Europe's reluctance to accept genetically engineered
foods, some have argued that these novel plants have provided
relatively minor tangible benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But farmers like Orlando Manuel, who has abandoned several farms
in an effort to escape the virus, would argue otherwise for the new
papaya. He said this year that he planted his entire 20 acres in
the genetically modified plant known as Rainbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be out of business without it,'' Manuel said. ``There's
nowhere to go. You can run but you cannot hide.''
</P>
<P>
   The first of the Rainbow papayas are on sale in grocery stores
in Hawaii and on the mainland. Like other genetically modified
crops, they have drawn little reaction from the American public.
Still, the new papaya is not without controversy or risks.
</P>
<P>
   Organic farmers say they are concerned about ecological risks.
Researchers inserted the disease virus' DNA into the plant's DNA,
using a method that had succeeded in protecting other crops, though
the exact mechanism of how this works is still being investigated.
The risks include the creation of new and more potent viral
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Growers also worry that the Rainbow plants may contaminate
nearby organic papaya plants by fertilizing them with genetically
modified pollen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been alarm here in the local area,'' said Roy Smith,
president of Hawaii Organic Farmers Association. Smith said he had
been receiving calls from farmers and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the international backlash against genetically
modified crops has begun to hit papayas. Dr. Dennis Gonsalves,
plant pathologist at Cornell University and one of the creators of
the new papaya, said the Mexican government requested that he
destroy experimental fields of genetically modified papaya in
Mexico because of growing concerns over possible environmental
risks, risks that he says do not exist.
</P>
<P>
   But acknowledging that there could be other risks from
genetically modified papaya, Gonsalves said even these were minimal
compared with the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``People use infinitesimal calculations that this thing might
happen and this thing might happen,'' Gonsalves said. ``If
everybody thinks that everything's got to be perfect with
genetically engineered stuff, then you can forget about it. We can
let the papaya industry die.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii's farmers have planted about 1,000 acres in Rainbow,
one-third of the papaya acreage in the state. Llantero said farmers
were planting the new seeds as fast as they became available.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the risk from the papaya ringspot virus, not
everyone is ready to plant Rainbow. Industry watchers say some
growers wonder whether there is a sufficient market for genetically
modified papayas.
</P>
<P>
   Typically 35 percent to 40 percent of the Hawaiian harvest is
sold to Japan, where genetically modified papayas have not been
approved for sale.
</P>
<P>
   The disease first appeared on the Hawaiian island of Oahu in the
1940s, and slowly spread from farm to farm and island to island.
Seven years ago, the virus made its way to the island of Hawaii,
where nearly all the state's papayas are grown.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists say none of their attempts to cure or prevent the
disease _ including traditional plant breeding, removal of diseased
trees and a type of plant vaccination _ were effective. (Though
called trees, papaya plants are actually extremely large herbs.)
</P>
<P>
   It was Gonsalves, with colleagues at the University of Hawaii
and the Agriculture Department, who began efforts to create a
virus-resistant papaya.
</P>
<P>
   Test plots grown in infected areas of Hawaii made clear the
genetically modified, or transgenic, plant's ability to resist the
virus. Transgenic plants grew healthy and green, side by side with
traditional varieties that yellowed, withered and died.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time that Rainbow has solved a problem for some
farmers, it may be creating problems for others. Gonsalves said
that organic papaya plants growing near genetically modified papaya
could be fertilized by genetically engineered pollen. The fruits
produced would then carry seeds with the engineered virus gene.
</P>
<P>
   If these seeds are replanted by organic farmers, then they will
unknowingly be growing genetically modified fruits, which are by
definition, not organic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growers want to know, is there a cost-effective way to make
sure that they're not planting genetically modified crops?'' Smith
said. ``It's difficult to find an affordable path to that kind of
integrity.'' He said Hawaiian farmers produced about $300,000 worth
of organic papaya each year, compared with nonorganic papaya, which
was worth about $18 million a year to farmers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the plant may pose broader ecological risks. Dr.
Peter Palukaitis, molecular virologist at the Scottish Crop
Research Institute in Dundee, said there were a number of ways in
which the new papaya could lead to the creation of new viruses, as
is the case whenever a virus gene is inserted into a plant's DNA.
</P>
<P>
   For example, researchers say the genetically engineered virus
gene in Rainbow may end up mixing with DNA from other viruses that
infect these papaya plants, possibly resulting in the creation of
new, potentially more virulent disease-causing viruses.
</P>
<P>
   With scientists still working to understand such interactions,
it remains unclear how readily new viruses may arise by these
means. Other risks include synergy, a situation in which the mere
presence of the genetically engineered virus in the plant's DNA
makes it sicker than it would be otherwise when infected by another
plant virus.
</P>
<P>
   Rainbow does not have wild relatives in Hawaii, so it cannot
spread its genetically engineered genes by creating hybrids with
native plants. In addition, Gonsalves said there appeared to be no
risk to humans from eating the protein produced by the virus gene
in the papaya. He said people had been eating infected fruits
containing the viral protein for years with no ill effect.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say, despite its apparently iron-clad resistance,
Rainbow is unlikely to protect Hawaii's farmers forever. A new
virus might make its way to the islands, evolve on the islands, or
already exist there in low numbers, and it could overcome the
protection now offered by Rainbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd all be nuts to say that this is the final solution,''
said Dr. Richard Manshardt, tropical fruit crops breeder and a
creator of Rainbow, at the University of Hawaii. ``Biological
systems evolve.''
</P>
<P>
   Like all Rainbow growers, Manuel received his genetically
modified seeds free from the Papaya Administrative Committee.
Unlike nearly every other genetically modified crop that has been
approved for commercial use, the new papaya was not produced by
profit-motivated seed companies, but by researchers at Cornell
University, the University of Hawaii and the Agriculture Department
who have allowed growers to use it free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   But Llantero said the Papaya Administrative Committee was
looking into selling the seeds to recoup the costs of seed
production, and Manshardt said the University of Hawaii was also
beginning to look into ways of earning money for research from the
fruit they helped to create.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately what will determine the success of the new papayas,
which differ somewhat in taste and color from the traditional
variety grown in Hawaii, is whether consumers are interested in
eating them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Food is what you're brought up with,'' said Stephanie Whalen,
president and director of research at the Hawaii Agriculture
Research Center. As for the market that the transgenic papaya can
command, she added, ``Only time will tell.''

JOHN KENNEDY JR., TELEVISION'S CHILD, WAS ONE OF OUR OWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the magnificent testaments to the power of television is
its immediacy and its persistence; how, for instance, its coverage
of major happenings can be swift, lengthy, relentless. Watching how
television dealt with the latest Kennedy clan tragedy, from the
stuffiness of CBS Evening News to the fluffiness of Entertainment
Tonight, reminds us of the medium's power, its reach, the way it
clearly separates the VIPs from the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   The story of a tiny plane crashing into the sea, a search coming
up with nothing but debris, three people missing and likely dead,
would be horrible enough in its own right.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a Kennedy, and a Kennedy wife, and a Kennedy
sister-in-law, and there are different rules for Kennedys, who have
always been like a small country governed by their own laws.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who have questioned the media for obsessing over
and honoring someone whose best-known accomplishment was being
famous by birth. But they are missing the larger picture.
</P>
<P>
   John Jr. is a celebrity, of course _ he's rich and handsome and
famous. He's the publisher of a much-talked-about magazine,
``George,'' and the son of a president. But he is not a president.
Or a head of state, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   So what is it, really, that generated so much blanketing,
suffocating coverage? The sort of all-day, all-night coverage that
accompanied the assassination of his father, President John F.
Kennedy, in 1963, or the Apollo
</P>
<P>
   moon landing 30 years ago Tuesday?
</P>
<P>
   A better parallel is not JFK's death or the Apollo landing, but
rather the death two years ago of Princess Diana, a celebrity who
had won a place in the hearts of everyday people.
</P>
<P>
   Watching CNN the other day on a television set up in a hotel
ballroom in Pasadena, Calif., where a press luncheon was taking
place, a hotel staffer stopped to watch. She began talking of
Kennedy as though she knew him, which she did not, or had met him,
which she had not.
</P>
<P>
   She talked, and somewhat proudly, of watching an interview on
Larry King Live and marveling at Kennedy's poise and charisma, how
a man of privilege could be ``so down to earth.'' (CNN played
excerpts from the interview time and again over the weekend; he was
indeed charming.)
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Kennedy really wasn't one of us; that he died
piloting a plane he bought just a year ago, that he had enough
money and influence to start his own magazine, that by virtue of
his birth he represented privilege, glamour, wealth, even pseudo
royalty.
</P>
<P>
   But the young woman felt she knew John Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The outpouring of televised and printed grief in the wake of
this tragedy can't be overstated but must be understood, since John
Jr. grew up in front of us, in our living rooms, on our tube.
</P>
<P>
   I think it's not so much about one person as it is about the
family, whose ongoing adversities are the same sort of drama we
seek in our prime-time programming, whose lives mirror a modern-day
Greek tragedy that couldn't be scripted because it would never be
believed.
</P>
<P>
   Few families have achieved as much as the Kennedys, and few have
endured as much pain.
</P>
<P>
   Television has certainly illuminated their journey. Their public
lives, their tribulations and sorrows became part of the lives of
people who have never met them but are sure they have.
</P>
<P>
   Through television, we've been witness to Kennedy triumph and
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Of John Jr.'s birth. His life.
</P>
<P>
   And now, his death.

MEASURE OF THE MAN FOUND IN HIS CHARACTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jim Rich considers himself an average guy.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody else would. His fly-on-the-wall view of American politics
during five administrations moves him into the ranks of the
extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   A decorated member of the Marine Corps' 1st Force Reconnaissance
who served in Vietnam (he'll gladly showed you the separation
papers that prove he was there), Rich joined the Treasury
Department's Secret Service in 1971 after looking at the various
options available in law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I chose the Secret Service because it was a small, close-knit
agency and that was the environment I was used to in Force Recon,''
Rich said.
</P>
<P>
   Rich was assigned to the detail protecting Alabama Gov. George
Wallace on May 15, 1972 _ the day Arthur Bremer ended the
governor's presidential aspirations with bullets at a campaign
speech in Laurel, Md. He was in the White House on temporary
assignment on Aug. 9, 1974, the night Richard Nixon resigned. He
was with Vice President Nelson Rockefeller on Sept. 5, 1975, the
day Lynette ``Squeaky'' Fromme took a shot at President Ford. And
he was with then-Vice President George Bush who was visiting Fort
Worth on March 30, 1981, the day John Hinckley Jr. shot President
Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife saw a news flash on TV that said the president and
several agents had been shot,'' Rich said. ``She called the local
office, and they contacted us through our communication channels.
We had to be the ones to tell the vice president that he was now
acting president and had to immediately return to Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Rich has scarcely changed in the almost 20 years I've known him
_ still Marine trim, still a head full of hair, now sprinkled with
gray. Our paths first crossed in 1980 when he was working a
security detail for then first lady Rosalynn Carter, who was
visiting Fort Worth. We reacquainted in '92, after Rich discovered
I had married the police sergeant who had worked with him in 1985
on a security plan for Reagan's visit to Grand Prairie.
</P>
<P>
   His last assignment before retiring in December 1992 was to
spend, as he describes it, ``three years in the back pocket of
George W. Bush'' while Bush was a partner with the Texas Rangers
baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   Rich is the epitome of discretion. He'll talk about his years as
an agent in general terms, but getting him to dish personal details
about any of the high-profile people he was assigned to protect is
nigh on impossible.
</P>
<P>
   So I was surprised last week when he called wanting to talk
about Governor Bush. He was livid about news articles and opinion
pieces that questioned whether the governor had received
preferential treatment to get into the National Guard during the
Vietnam War, or whether Texas taxpayers should be picking up the
tab for the Department of Public Safety personnel traveling with
Bush as he campaigns for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``George is not the first sitting governor running for president
to use state troopers as part of his security detail,'' Rich said.
``I personally witnessed the Alabama state troopers who accompanied
Wallace on his treks across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad commentary on our social structure that a governor
has to be that concerned about security. But people strike out
against political figures not because of their politics, but
because they want a place in history. Bremer had no problem with
Wallace's politics; he just saw an opportunity for fame.''
</P>
<P>
   Degreed in political science and history _ his last paper at
Houston Baptist College paralleled the Senate campaigns of Lloyd
Bentsen and George Herbert Walker Bush _ Rich discounted reports
that Papa Bush might have used his clout to keep one of his sons
out of the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the president had done anything as a congressman to pull
strings for George, it would have come out during his Senate race
against Bentsen in 1970,'' Rich said. ``Remember, Texas was a
Democratic stronghold back then and Bentsen was the one who called
politics a contact sport. He would have used it if it was there to
use.''
</P>
<P>
   The other opportunity for dirt to rise to the top, Rich said,
would have been when the elder Bush went through confirmation
hearings for appointment as director of the CIA. Nothing surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   Rich doesn't have a problem with anyone questioning George W.'s
politics. But woe unto the hack who takes a lick at George W.'s
character.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be seriously wrong to let people who don't know
anything about George attack one of the finest people I have ever
met,'' Rich said. ``I had the extraordinary opportunity to see a
real good person for an extended period of time, and I wouldn't
feel good about sitting by while seeing him criticized wrongly.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush has been cautious about expressing specific policies
at this early stage of his quest for the presidency, his belief in
personal values didn't just gel when he decided to run for higher
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent a lot of time at The Ballpark with George when he was
still active with the Rangers,'' Rich said. ``He would see people
come into the stadium wearing T-shirts with profane messages on
them. The way George ran things, he would have stadium security
discreetly talk with the people, and give them the option to go to
the restroom and turn the shirt inside out, or leave the stadium.
There was no room for profanity in the family environment he wanted
at the games.''
</P>
<P>
   So what about the governor's character most impressed a Secret
Service agent who spent more than 20 years observing political
families?
</P>
<P>
   ``His genuine feelings for family, baseball and Mom's apple
pie,'' Rich said. ``He was always worried about schedule changes
and whether we would have to be away from our families on holidays
and weekends. Every Christmas he and Laura hosted a party for the
agents and their families. He and my wife, Barbara, would talk
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bush family _ and I mean the whole family _ enjoys the
healthiest relationships in a political family that I've seen in my
career.''
</P>
<P>
   And what about those who castigate Bush for his lack of military
experience in Vietnam?
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, there was nothing over there that prepared you to
be president,'' Rich said. ``I'd happily spot him my two years if I
thought it would make a difference.''

<P>
   Many people feel alarmed when they begin to experience numbness
and tingling in their hands and wrists, assuming that they must
have carpal tunnel syndrome, the sometimes disabling nerve
disorder. Now a new study _ the most comprehensive to date _ finds
that they are often wrong, although the disease is more prevalent
than had been expected.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 1 in 5 people with these symptoms _ characteristic of
the family of diseases known as repetitive strain injury _ have the
syndrome, in which a nerve becomes pinched in the wrist, the
researchers found. An estimated 200,000 people in the United States
have surgery each year to repair the condition, often paid for by
workers' compensation programs.
</P>
<P>
   But while the study, published in the current issue of The
Journal of the American Medical Association, won praise for its
scope and the precision with which it documented the prevalence of
the disease, some experts said it only underscored basic
disagreement among health professionals over how to diagnose carpal
tunnel syndrome and even how to define it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a condition which appears to be very common and exacts
a considerable toll and morbidity on a large number of people,''
said Dr. Alfred Franzblau, a public health specialist at the
University of Michigan. Yet, he said, ``We don't have well-defined
criteria for who should get surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   The study was conducted by Swedish researchers who began by
sending questionnaires to 3,000 people randomly selected in
southern Sweden. The people were asked a range of questions about
their health, including whether they were experiencing the classic
symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome: pain, numbness, or tingling in
two or more fingers. These symptoms often occur during sleep.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 percent of those surveyed replied, a rate considered
extraordinary by researchers in other parts of the world. Of those
responding, almost 15 percent, or 354 people, reported having the
symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   When researchers examined that group, they found they could
document carpal tunnel syndrome in as many as 3.8 percent of the
people and nerve damage in about 5 percent. Although researchers
looked for a link with other medical conditions, only people with
weight problems appeared to be at greater risk.
</P>
<P>
   People suffering from symptoms similar to those of carpal tunnel
syndrome may actually have other RSI conditions, like tendinitis.
</P>
<P>
   The lead author of the study, Dr. Isam Atroshi, said in a
telephone interview that researchers had not expected the
prevalence of the disease to be so high. ``I was surprised,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Carpal tunnel syndrome is often found in people who perform
repetitive tasks that put a strain on the tendons of the wrist. It
is common among meat packers and people who use computers a great
deal. It can often be prevented by taking frequent breaks to
stretch and by making sure that the work station puts minimal
strain on the wrists.
</P>
<P>
   A person develops the syndrome when the tendons of the wrist
become swollen from overuse, trapping the median nerve that carries
signals to the hand. Left untreated, serious nerve damage can
occur. In many cases, splints and medications can ease the problem,
but when this does not work, surgeons slice open the sheath through
which the nerve and tendons run, freeing the pressure on the nerve.
</P>
<P>
   Although some experts not associated with the study praised the
research, saying that it helped to document the prevalence of the
problem, it also highlighted the level of uncertainty about carpal
tunnel syndrome even among the doctors who treat the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``One would expect there to be a strong empirical foundation to
explain the pathophysiology and natural history of the syndrome and
to support clear diagnostic criteria,'' Franzblau wrote in an
editorial in the medical journal. ``Surprisingly, this is not the
case.''
</P>
<P>
   In examining their subjects to see which ones had carpal tunnel
syndrome, the Swedish researchers used several methods, with each
yielding different results.
</P>
<P>
   They first made diagnoses based on clinical examinations in
which the subjects were asked to describe their symptoms and were
checked for signs like sensitivity and muscle strength.
</P>
<P>
   The subjects were then given nerve conduction tests in which
technicians administered small jolts of electricity and measured
how quickly the jolts traveled along the nerves. If the electricity
moves too slowly, it can be a sign of carpal tunnel syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   But the researchers found that some patients who showed nerve
damage in the conduction tests experienced no symptoms, while some
of those diagnosed clinically with carpal tunnel syndrome exhibited
no nerve damage.
</P>
<P>
   Atroshi said there was nothing unusual about the difficulty
involved in defining carpal tunnel syndrome, saying that similar
issues have surfaced with other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of clear-cut diagnostic tools, many physicians
are taking different paths when treating patients who may have
carpal tunnel syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Barry P. Simmons, chief of hand surgery at Brigham and
Women's Hospital in Boston, said that most of the time he did not
order conductivity tests, relying instead on a clinical
examination. Even if a conductivity test suggested nerve damage, he
said, he would not operate if the patient was symptom-free. And for
those patients experiencing symptoms, he said, the evidence is
usually clear enough without other tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a clinician,'' he said, ``my concern is, what are the
patient's symptoms?''

A HOT TIME IN THE HOME OF BASEBALL THIS WEEKEND

<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ In the chronicle of baseball, a weekend like
the one upcoming comes along about once every 50 years. The
ingredients are in place not only to immortalize several of its
cherished heroes, but to celebrate the sport's resurgent popularity
as the millennium ends.
</P>
<P>
   Cooperstown is the place. What is usually a sleepy little town
of 2,300 at the tip of Otsego Lake will become the nerve center of
the nation's pastime for 72 hours. An all-star lineup of events are
packed into three hectic days, with the highlight to come at 1 p.m.
Sunday at the Clark Sports Center. There, a short walk from the
Hall of Fame, seven plaques will be unveiled during the induction
ceremony, including those for Nolan Ryan, George Brett and Robin
Yount.
</P>
<P>
   Admission is free, but plan to arrive early. Officials are
expecting a record-breaking crowd in excess of 40,000. In addition,
42 Hall of Famers (another record) are expected to attend. The
whole thing will be recorded by 900 accredited members and watched
by a national television audience.
</P>
<P>
   Activities slip into high gear Saturday, with a free autograph
session for children. The first 300 children between the ages of 7
and 12 who purchase a junior admission ticket to the museum will be
able to request autographs from Hall of Famers. That session will
take place from 3 to 4:30 p.m. Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Another children's autograph session is scheduled for Monday,
July 26, from 8:30 to 10 a.m. Like on Saturday, the first 300
children 7 to 12 who purchase junior tickets to the museum will be
eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday also will feature the ninth annual New York-Penn League
game at Doubleday Field. For those who were unable to get tickets
to the Hall of Fame game on Monday, it's a good opportunity to see
the park.
</P>
<P>
   Admission is free, with seating available on a first-come,
first-served basis. The game, between the Oneonta Tigers and Hudson
Valley Renegades, begins at 2 p.m. ``This gives thousands of fans
the opportunity to enjoy exciting minor-league baseball in a
nostalgic setting,'' said Sam Nader, owner of the Oneonta Tigers.
No reserved seating is available for the induction ceremony. As
usual, those who arrive early will get the best views.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's annual Hall of Fame Game between the Texas Rangers and
Kansas City Royals sold out two hours after tickets went on sale

A REVIVAL FOR WORK ON A STREP VACCINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Minn., Md., Tenn.)   (af)  
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the first time in 20 years, medical researchers will soon
test in people a vaccine against the group A streptococcus, the bug
that causes strep throat and rheumatic fever and is feared as the
``flesh-eating'' bacterium.
</P>
<P>
   Work on such vaccines nearly dried up after some children who
received an experimental vaccine about 30 years ago developed
rheumatic fever, raising fears that the vaccine could cause a
disease it was meant to prevent.
</P>
<P>
   So great was the concern that the Food and Drug Administration
in 1979 made a regulation prohibiting group A strep vaccines from
ever being licensed for use. No other such prohibition exists.
</P>
<P>
   The regulation, however, does not prohibit clinical trials, and
now, gingerly, some researchers are about to venture forth again.
One clinical trial has recently been approved by the FDA and two
other groups also hope to win approval within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists hope that the new tools of biotechnology, unavailable
20 or 30 years ago, will allow them to overcome any safety risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the science has moved to the point where for the
first time in many, many years we have the potential for a safe and
efficacious vaccine,'' said Dr. Fran A. Rubin, program officer for
group A strep at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases, which has financially supported the research and is
conducting the first trial along with academic researchers and
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are technical obstacles to overcome and even if all
goes well, it will be at least several years before any vaccine is
approved for use.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in a vaccine is growing because of the increase over
the last decade in cases of deadly diseases linked to strep A,
particularly the so-called ``flesh-eating'' disease, which is fatal
in about 25 percent of cases.
</P>
<P>
   Another is a toxic shock similar to the type that affected some
women who used a certain type of tampon in the 1980s. Jim Henson,
the creator of the Muppets, died in 1990 from pneumonia caused by
streptococcus A.
</P>
<P>
   In all there were an estimated 9,700 cases of such invasive
strep A diseases with 1,100 deaths in the United States in 1997,
the latest year for which data are available, according to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Strep throat itself is usually easily treated with penicillin.
Still, there are several million such cases a year in the United
States, mostly in children. So a vaccine that prevents strep throat
could save hundreds of millions of dollars in medical costs and
countless trips to a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   As for rheumatic fever, it is now rare in the United States,
though there are occasional outbreaks including one of about 20
cases in New York City in the last few months and another of
several hundred in Utah over the last several years. But in the
developing world, rheumatic fever is the leading cause of heart
disease, with as many as 1 percent or 2 percent of children in some
countries suffering from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been to places where there are two kids to a bed with
rheumatic heart disease,'' said Dr. Edward L. Kaplan, professor of
pediatrics at the University of Minnesota School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how a strep infection leads to heart disease is not
understood. But some evidence suggests that antibodies produced by
the body to fight the bacteria also react with heart tissue. That
is the reason for concern that a vaccine designed to stimulate the
body to produce antibodies to the bacteria, could be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   So researchers say they are proceeding cautiously. ``This is an
extremely carefully designed trial,'' said Dr. Karen Kotloff,
associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Maryland
Center for Vaccine Development, who will conduct the first trial.
In the first phase, 15 healthy adults will be vaccinated to see if
the vaccine is safe. Each will get up to six echocardiograms to
search for any heart damage.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine was developed by Dr. James B. Dale, professor and
chief of infectious diseases at the Veterans Administration Medical
Center in Memphis and the University of Tennessee, where research
has been under way for more than 30 years. The vaccine is licensed
to ID Biomedical Corp. of Vancouver, Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccines of decades ago generally consisted of a major
protein from the bacterium called the M protein. But studies have
shown that parts of this protein elicit antibodies that react with
heart tissue. Genetic engineering has allowed Dale to take only
parts of the M protein for use in his vaccine, leaving out the
parts that seem to elicit antibodies that react with heart tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the health risk, the other big challenge to developing a
strep A vaccine stems from the fact 100 or more types of the
bacterium exist, each with a different M protein. Dale has taken
pieces of the M protein from six different types and strung them
together.
</P>
<P>
   But some skeptics doubt that protecting against six strains, or
serotypes, is enough. ``You're only protecting against the common
serotypes in a given area, and they vary around the United
States,'' said Dr. Vincent A. Fischetti, a professor at Rockefeller
University who is working on a different approach to a vaccine.
``In developing countries we don't even know the serotypes.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dale said he hoped eventually to have a vaccine effective
against 24 types, which would account for 80 percent to 85 percent
of the cases in the United States. And it would be possible to
change the vaccine for different times and places, just as the flu
vaccine is changed each year.
</P>
<P>
   Fischetti's vaccine is a nasal or oral spray that uses part of
the M protein that does not vary among different types of the
bacteria, so that a single vaccine should work against all types.
He is putting the genes for the production of the M protein
fragment into another type of bacteria that typically are found on
people's teeth and gums.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that these bacteria with the M protein will spur
immunity that prevents the strep bacteria from ever getting a
foothold in the respiratory system.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. P. Patrick Cleary, professor of microbiology at the
University of Minnesota, is developing a vaccine using another
protein that streptococcus A uses to help evade the body's defense
systems. This protein also has the advantage of being the same in
all forms of strep, he said. He said he hoped to apply to the FDA
by this fall to begin clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually clinical trials will have to be extended from a few
healthy adults to thousands of children, who will be followed to
see if they have a lower incidence of strep diseases than a control
group. And before any vaccine could be approved, the FDA would have
to remove its 1979 ban, something it is now considering.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably should be deleted anyway,'' said Dr. William M.
Egan, acting director of the agency's office of vaccines.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was a benevolent fate that decreed John Kennedy,
Jr.'s demise in the time of Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Under another president, under Ronald Reagan, George Bush, or
Jimmy Carter, even under George Bush, Jr. or Al Gore, the death of
JFK, Jr. would hardly have had the resonance it has in America
today, and certainly not the capacity to generate such a mood of
national mourning and regret for what might have been.
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton spoke, as he did Monday morning at a
reception for the victorious U.S. women's soccer team, of this
being a moment when ``we really stop to recognize that, as big and
diverse as our country is, we can come together as a national
family,'' he was reflecting a sentiment that nearly all Americans
seemed to share.
</P>
<P>
   As with the untimely death of the Princess of Wales almost two
years ago for Britain, the death of 38-year-old JFK, Jr. and his
33-year-old wife caught a moment when currents of generations and
social and political trends all came together as neither before nor
since.
</P>
<P>
   For Britain, the public outpouring of grief marked the passing
of a certain idea of the Royal Family; it sealed the decline of the
stiff upper lip as the defining feature of Englishness, and it
seemed to sanction a change in the role of women, who saw in
Diana's unhappy marriage and fulfilled motherhood a mirror of their
own experience.
</P>
<P>
   There is a similarly unique crisscrossing of strands in the
United States now. Those in the prime of their power and influence,
driving the Kennedy nostalgia, are the JFK generation.
</P>
<P>
   The politicians are those, like Bill Clinton, who remember the
exhilaration of John Kennedy's election and the promise it held.
They are the generation that remembers the shock of his
assassination, and recall their hopes, dashed again, five years
later, with the killing of the heir apparent, his brother, Robert.
</P>
<P>
   The luminaries of the media are those who cut their teeth as
junior reporters at those events. And their audience is anyone in
their late 30s or older, who remembers the heartrending pictures of
the fatherless Kennedy children as they grew up, or who grew up
with parents comparing their good fortune and progress with that of
their Kennedy contemporaries.
</P>
<P>
   The personal reminiscences of John Kennedy, Jr.'s college
contemporaries _ like CNN's international reporter Christiane
Ammanpour _ who have paid their personal tributes to him over the
weekend as an unaffected friend and engaging character are among
them.
</P>
<P>
   But so, too, are less privileged members of their generation.
``You have to understand, I grew up with John-John'' were
sentiments heard frequently from their contemporaries as the news
of his death sunk in Monday. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 450) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The youth of Bill Clinton when he was elected to the White
House, and the revival of racial and health-care equality as
political concerns at the start of his presidency all reinforced _
with however little justification _ the feeling that the hopes of
the Kennedy administration, with its civil-rights priorities, could
be revived.
</P>
<P>
   And, while the actual course of the Clinton presidency looks
likely to leave Americans less equal economically than when Bill
Clinton came to the White House, Clinton has reached out to black
and poor Americans in a way that no other president since JFK has
done. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the emergence of JFK, Jr. to prominence in Manhattan, a
financial _ but above all, a social _ success, the Kennedy myth
gained a new foothold with a different social group and a new
generation.
</P>
<P>
   He and his glamorous wife, Carolyn Bessette, reflected _ as the
pile of flowers and tributes outside his home testifies _ a fellow
feeling among younger Manhattanites that here was someone like
them, just richer, more successful, and ``better.''
</P>
<P>
   Like his late father, John Jr. was able to bear the glitz that
attended social success without giving the impression that he had
lost his concern for the less fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   John Kennedy, Jr.'s death also comes at a time when much of the
negative baggage that the family name carried has been dissipated.
</P>
<P>
   The recklessly fast living of his father behind the scenes of
the White House has been at least partly neutralized by the Oval
Office exploits of Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   More significant, perhaps, is the passing _ with the older
Kennedys, perhaps _ of the pervasive suspicion of the family's
Catholicism and its Irish immigrant origins that attended John
Kennedy's presidential campaign and supplied fuel for his political
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   That JFK, Jr. is the scion of a Catholic family or of Irish
descent has almost not been mentioned in the outpouring of sorrow
and reminiscence. For this generation, the Kennedys are Americans;
they are people of ``strong faith,'' but the nature of that faith
is now almost immaterial.
</P>
<P>
   As with the mourning for the Princess of Wales, the moment when
all the propitious currents converge is short and unlikely to be
repeated.
</P>
<P>
   Already, in the views of the 10 percent or so of Americans who
look askance at the shock and grief attending JFK Jr.'s death can
be divined the end of the Kennedy mystique.
</P>
<P>
   If the suspicion based in the religion and immigrant origins of
the Kennedys is no more, there is a new wariness of their
prominence and continuing influence as America's self-styled
``royal family.''
</P>
<P>
   Such sentiments are concentrated among those who are too young
to have any recollection of the JFK years and no reason to identify
themselves in any way with his children. They are concentrated
among those in poor or minority districts who see little prospect
of escape.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also expressed by young meritocrats, who see the
Kennedy clan as irrelevant, and see JFK, Jr. as a young man of
privilege who would not have got where he got without his name and
fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this hostility could be felt when the Pentagon called a
press conference to report on the air-sea rescue effort, just hours
after the plane was reported missing.
</P>
<P>
   The younger reporters pressed for any hint that the extensive
rescue effort was out of the ordinary and unwarranted, driven by
the Kennedy name and celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   Some of it is being expressed _ in the newspaper correspondence
columns, but above all over the Internet _ in response to the
media's saturation coverage of JFK Jr.'s death. Some comments were
so virulent that Internet services saw fit to excise them.
</P>
<P>
   In this primitive debate about the significance of John Jr. can
be heard the voice, and priorities, of the post-Kennedy,
post-Clinton generation.
</P>
<P>
   We can expect that the anniversary of JFK Jr.'s death, like the
first anniversary of Princess of Wales's death, will be but a faint
echo of the national mourning now in progress; that it will be so
faint as hardly to warrant the description ``national'' at all. &QL;

FEW IN TEXAS MILITARY FLINCHING OVER ANTHRAX SHOTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By CHRIS VAUGHN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH _ The worst it got for Maj. Gary Richards was a knot
on his arm for a couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flu shot knocked me out worse than that,'' said Richards,
an Air Force C-130 pilot. ``And the knot was only for the first
shot. The second two didn't bother me at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The shots Richards received were part of the anthrax
vaccination, the most talked about, and perhaps most feared,
immunization the U.S. military has ever pushed through a needle.
</P>
<P>
   The immunization program is supposed to protect American troops
from almost certain death if they are attacked with chemical
weapons causing the disease. But concern about the vaccine's safety
has spawned a small, highly unusual, protest movement, led to
dozens of disciplinary actions against troops and caused an unknown
number to quietly leave the service.
</P>
<P>
   But in Texas, the vaccinations appear to be creating few waves,
at least so far.
</P>
<P>
   No one at Naval Air Station Fort Worth Joint Reserve Base _
where Richards is stationed _ or Dyess Air Force Base at Abilene
has declined to take the shot, officials report, and only a
half-dozen soldiers at giant Fort Hood in Central Texas have
refused.
</P>
<P>
   But since most servicemen and women have not had to line up for
an anthrax shot yet, that number is certain to go up.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has refused yet, though that's not to say it won't
happen in the future,'' acknowledged Maj. John Boyle, a spokesman
for Dyess, where about 25 percent of base personnel have received
at least one shot.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone in uniform is used to rolling up a sleeve for yet another
immunization. Flu, tetanus, typhoid, hepatitis A, they are all
routine. But the anthrax immunization program has been anything but
routine.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 service members, both active-duty and reservists,
have balked at taking the vaccine. They include 23 sailors who were
about to ship out on the USS Theodore Roosevelt carrier and 14
Marines stationed in Hawaii. Refusing the shot is considered
disobeying an order and subjects a person to a demotion, prison
time, a dishonorable discharge and a loss of benefits.
</P>
<P>
   More than 312,000 men and women in uniform have received at
least one of the shots, one of a series of six that must be taken
over an 18-month period. A Defense Department spokesman said so few
have refused that they do not actively keep track of the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon, responding to a belief that a number of countries
either had the biological weapon or could get it easily, began
inoculating service members against anthrax last year. The goal is
to immunize all 2.4 million Americans in uniform by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Anthrax can be spread through contact with animals or meat, but
it is most deadly when it is released into the air. A person
breathing the odorless, tasteless spores gets a fever and grows
fatigued and can bleed to death internally within 24 to 36 hours.
It is more than 95 percent fatal, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   An anthrax attack is not known to have ever occurred. It is
considered a real threat only in Southwest Asia and the Korean
area, but the military wants every service member inoculated so
that everyone is deployable.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine has been approved as safe by the Food and Drug
Administration and the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention and has been used since the 1970s, including for some
troops who fought in Desert Storm.
</P>
<P>
   But there are concerns in the service's rank and file about what
the vaccine's long-term effects might be and whether it would even
protect them against the disease. The worries are fueled largely by
information and personal stories on the Internet and a suggested
link to what is known as the Persian Gulf War illness.
</P>
<P>
   Early this month, the only company that produces the vaccine
said it is perilously close to bankruptcy. Then last week, the Navy
Times called for an end to mandatory inoculations, writing that
``troops should be given the chance to decline.''
</P>
<P>
   The fear has forced the military to respond. Marine Corps
Commandant James Jones raised the subject during a visit to Naval
Air Station Fort Worth this month, telling the Marines that he
believes the vaccine is safe. Other commanders across the nation
have conducted meetings with their troops and sent worried people
to see doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Bill Tyra, who commands about 1,500 Marines at the naval
air station, brought in a team of medical experts from Washington,
D.C., this year to answer what he called tough questions and to
alleviate much of the anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to tell anyone they can't be concerned about the
vaccine,'' said Tyra, who has taken three of the shots. ``These
Marines are asking good hard questions. And if they (Pentagon
officials) want to get this through successfully, they'll answer
them. Sometimes just giving an order isn't enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of active-duty personnel and reservists at the naval
air station have received the vaccinations, including members of
the Air Force Reserve's 301st Fighter Wing, the 136th Airlift Wing
of the Texas Air National Guard, Marine Aircraft Group 41 and Naval
Fleet Logistic Support Squadron 59.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been the subject of a lot of jokes, but we haven't had a
single person refuse or even attempt to refuse,'' said Capt. Keil
Hubert, with the Air National Guard unit.
</P>
<P>
   At Fort Hood outside Killeen, the Army's largest installation
with 42,000 soldiers, only about 5,000 soldiers have started the
series of shots. A half-dozen soldiers refused; one of them has
already been discharged.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a groundswell revolt against it,'' base spokesman
Cecil Green said. ``Most people recognize the danger of anthrax and
take the shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Richards, an 18-year Air Force veteran, believes in that danger.
He calls anthrax a ``cheap terrorist's toy'' that outweighs any
potential risk of the vaccine. As for the knot on his arm, it did
not worry him, he said, because minor swelling and tenderness are
common reactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a paranoid person,'' he said. ``The way I looked at it
was the risk involved in the shot is nowhere near the risk of an
anthrax attack.''

   You have a glass of white wine in one hand and a cracker in the
other when that odd shooting pain starts up in your right hip
again. But what luck _ standing right next to you at the buffet
table, looking around for someone to talk to, is your second cousin
Harry the doctor, a lovely guy, one of your favorite people and a
noted hip expert.
</P>
<P>
   Don't do it.
</P>
<P>
   The chances are that Harry would be flattered and more than
delighted to hear all about your hip. He might even bring you down
to the office for an X-ray and write you out a prescription. But
the chances also are that the fonder you and Harry are of each
other and the further back you two go, the worse off you and your
hip may ultimately be.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the most bizarre and least understood paradoxes of
medicine: being a good doctor to one's friends and relatives is an
almost impossible task. The sages have been teaching it for
hundreds of years, but their wisdom generally is ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, doctors tend to learn this lesson from bitter personal
experience _ and many of us learn it over and over and over again,
because we would very much like it not to be true.
</P>
<P>
   But it almost always is.
</P>
<P>
   The balance between objectivity and good will that lets one
person oversee the health of another is a delicate yet remarkably
elastic thing. Once established, it can expand into exactly the
same kind of affection and vigilant allegiance found in the best
friendships and marriages. Every doctor in the world has a few
patients he or she would do anything for, patients who inspire the
almost visceral loyalty that a child does, or an old war buddy, and
who get superlative medical care.
</P>
<P>
   But for some reason this magical process cannot be made to run
in reverse. When the affection and loyalty come first and the
medical relationship second, everything tends to go to pieces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Solicitude obscures the judgment,'' warned the British doctor
Thomas Percival in an 18th century medical textbook. It produces
``timidity and irresolution in the practice,'' wrote the founders
of the American Medical Association in the 19th century, mandating
that doctors send their spouses and children to others for medical
care.
</P>
<P>
   In our century, many hospitals prohibit medical staff members
from caring for their relatives on the premises, and Medicare will
generally not cover expenses when the patient is a relative or
household member of the billing doctor.
</P>
<P>
   But the message behind these and similar regulations goes widely
unheeded. In some of the only statistics on the subject, a survey
about 10 years ago found that more than 70 percent of doctors had
examined family members, and 80 percent had diagnosed illnesses or
prescribed medications for them.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the mishaps that may ensue, from just one poor
transgressor's personal embarrassments over the last several years.
</P>
<P>
   One parent had a toe a few years ago that suddenly began to
darken. My diagnosis: imminent gangrene of the foot, a medical
emergency. Actual diagnosis: toenail fungus.
</P>
<P>
   The other parent felt dizzy and weak one evening and went to bed
uncharacteristically early. My diagnosis: almost certainly a heart
attack. Medical emergency. Actual diagnosis: hunger and heartburn.
</P>
<P>
   A friend had an angry blistering rash up one leg last month, and
a bad headache. My diagnosis: a rare case of herpes of the leg, or
possibly the beginnings of a flesh-eating streptococcal infection.
Better take some antibiotics. Could easily turn into a medical
emergency. Actual diagnosis: poison oak.
</P>
<P>
   My great aunt had palpitations for years. Diagnosis of the
doctors in the family: the vapors. You know how she is. Treatment
provided: shrugs and a mild tranquilizer. Actual diagnosis: an
uncommon tumor of the heart, found without difficulty by an
unrelated doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily reasoned judgments tend to go sour when the patient
has a familiar face. Conservatives become alarmists, activists turn
dangerously laissez-faire. Embarrassing but important personal
questions are never asked. Corners are cut. Decisions are made too
soon, too late or not at all.
</P>
<P>
   No one knew this phenomenon better than Dr. Franz Ingelfinger, a
prominent Harvard gastroenterologist who edited The New England
Journal of Medicine for many years before his death in 1980.
Ingelfinger had the eerie bad luck to develop cancer of the
esophagus, exactly the disease in which he was an international
expert. In his case, the patient had the most familiar face of all.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, after his diagnosis, colleagues, friends
and family, world-renowned doctors all, rallied around him, putting
in their own two cents about the best treatment course. The result
was pure chaos, a miserable tangle of medical acumen, love,
friendship and good intentions. His care ground to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally,'' Ingelfinger wrote later, ``when the pangs of
indecision had become nearly intolerable, one wise physician friend
said, `What you need is a doctor.''' Ingelfinger found himself a
doctor, and felt ``immediate and immense relief.''
</P>
<P>
   So learn from the mistakes of others. If your hip is really
bothering you, ask your cousin Harry for the name of a good
orthopedist and leave it at that.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was a benevolent fate that decreed John Kennedy,
Jr.'s demise in the time of Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Under another president, under Ronald Reagan, George Bush, or
Jimmy Carter, even under George Bush, Jr. or Al Gore, the death of
JFK, Jr. would hardly have had the resonance it has in America
today, and certainly not the capacity to generate such a mood of
national mourning and regret for what might have been.
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton spoke, as he did Monday morning at a
reception for the victorious U.S. women's soccer team, of this
being a moment when ``we really stop to recognize that, as big and
diverse as our country is, we can come together as a national
family,'' he was reflecting a sentiment that nearly all Americans
seemed to share.
</P>
<P>
   As with the untimely death of the Princess of Wales almost two
years ago for Britain, the death of 38-year-old JFK, Jr. and his
33-year-old wife caught a moment when currents of generations and
social and political trends all came together as neither before nor
since.
</P>
<P>
   For Britain, the public outpouring of grief marked the passing
of a certain idea of the Royal Family; it sealed the decline of the
stiff upper lip as the defining feature of Englishness, and it
seemed to sanction a change in the role of women, who saw in
Diana's unhappy marriage and fulfilled motherhood a mirror of their
own experience.
</P>
<P>
   There is a similarly unique crisscrossing of strands in the
United States now. Those in the prime of their power and influence,
driving the Kennedy nostalgia, are the JFK generation.
</P>
<P>
   The politicians are those, like Bill Clinton, who remember the
exhilaration of John Kennedy's election and the promise it held.
They are the generation that remembers the shock of his
assassination, and recall their hopes, dashed again, five years
later, with the killing of the heir apparent, his brother, Robert.
</P>
<P>
   The luminaries of the media are those who cut their teeth as
junior reporters at those events. And their audience is anyone in
their late 30s or older, who remembers the heartrending pictures of
the fatherless Kennedy children as they grew up, or who grew up
with parents comparing their good fortune and progress with that of
their Kennedy contemporaries.
</P>
<P>
   The personal reminiscences of John Kennedy, Jr.'s college
contemporaries _ like CNN's international reporter Christiane
Ammanpour _ who have paid their personal tributes to him over the
weekend as an unaffected friend and engaging character are among
them.
</P>
<P>
   But so, too, are less privileged members of their generation.
``You have to understand, I grew up with John-John'' were
sentiments heard frequently from their contemporaries as the news
of his death sunk in Monday. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 450) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The youth of Bill Clinton when he was elected to the White
House, and the revival of racial and health-care equality as
political concerns at the start of his presidency all reinforced _
with however little justification _ the feeling that the hopes of
the Kennedy administration, with its civil-rights priorities, could
be revived.
</P>
<P>
   And, while the actual course of the Clinton presidency looks
likely to leave Americans less equal economically than when Bill
Clinton came to the White House, Clinton has reached out to black
and poor Americans in a way that no other president since JFK has
done. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the emergence of JFK, Jr. to prominence in Manhattan, a
financial _ but above all, a social _ success, the Kennedy myth
gained a new foothold with a different social group and a new
generation.
</P>
<P>
   He and his glamorous wife, Carolyn Bessette, reflected _ as the
pile of flowers and tributes outside his home testifies _ a fellow
feeling among younger Manhattanites that here was someone like
them, just richer, more successful, and ``better.''
</P>
<P>
   Like his late father, John Jr. was able to bear the glitz that
attended social success without giving the impression that he had
lost his concern for the less fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   John Kennedy, Jr.'s death also comes at a time when much of the
negative baggage that the family name carried has been dissipated.
</P>
<P>
   The recklessly fast living of his father behind the scenes of
the White House has been at least partly neutralized by the Oval
Office exploits of Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   More significant, perhaps, is the passing _ with the older
Kennedys, perhaps _ of the pervasive suspicion of the family's
Catholicism and its Irish immigrant origins that attended John
Kennedy's presidential campaign and supplied fuel for his political
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   That JFK, Jr. is the scion of a Catholic family or of Irish
descent has almost not been mentioned in the outpouring of sorrow
and reminiscence. For this generation, the Kennedys are Americans;
they are people of ``strong faith,'' but the nature of that faith
is now almost immaterial.
</P>
<P>
   As with the mourning for the Princess of Wales, the moment when
all the propitious currents converge is short and unlikely to be
repeated.
</P>
<P>
   Already, in the views of the 10 percent or so of Americans who
look askance at the shock and grief attending JFK Jr.'s death can
be divined the end of the Kennedy mystique.
</P>
<P>
   If the suspicion based in the religion and immigrant origins of
the Kennedys is no more, there is a new wariness of their
prominence and continuing influence as America's self-styled
``royal family.''
</P>
<P>
   Such sentiments are concentrated among those who are too young
to have any recollection of the JFK years and no reason to identify
themselves in any way with his children. They are concentrated
among those in poor or minority districts who see little prospect
of escape.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also expressed by young meritocrats, who see the
Kennedy clan as irrelevant, and see JFK, Jr. as a young man of
privilege who would not have got where he got without his name and
fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this hostility could be felt when the Pentagon called a
press conference to report on the air-sea rescue effort, just hours
after the plane was reported missing.
</P>
<P>
   The younger reporters pressed for any hint that the extensive
rescue effort was out of the ordinary and unwarranted, driven by
the Kennedy name and celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   Some of it is being expressed _ in the newspaper correspondence
columns, but above all over the Internet _ in response to the
media's saturation coverage of JFK Jr.'s death. Some comments were
so virulent that Internet services saw fit to excise them.
</P>
<P>
   In this primitive debate about the significance of John Jr. can
be heard the voice, and priorities, of the post-Kennedy,
post-Clinton generation.
</P>
<P>
   We can expect that the anniversary of JFK Jr.'s death, like the
first anniversary of Princess of Wales's death, will be but a faint
echo of the national mourning now in progress; that it will be so
faint as hardly to warrant the description ``national'' at all. &QL;

PERSONAL HEALTH: STILL MUCH TO GAIN FROM FIBER-RICH DIET 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(lb) 
 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You've heard it now for years: Fiber is good for you. Eat more
whole grains, dried peas and beans, fruits and vegetables, if you
want to stay healthy. Fiber protects the colon against cancer. It
also helps the heart by lowering cholesterol, reduces the risk of
developing diabetes and facilitates weight control.
</P>
<P>
   Then along comes a widely publicized Harvard study of nearly
89,000 nurses that seems to derail the fiber bandwagon. The study,
published this year in The New England Journal of Medicine, found
no greater protection from colon cancer among the women who
consumed the highest amount of fiber, more than 25 grams a day,
than among those who consumed the least fiber, less than 10 grams a
day.
</P>
<P>
   But before you decide that it is now OK to return to pasty white
bread, white rice and pasta and shun those greens, whole grains and
other fiber-rich plant foods, it is important to put this
disheartening study in perspective and appreciate the diverse
benefits that dietary fiber can bestow.
</P>
<P>
   Fiber, the Protector
</P>
<P>
   Fiber first gained celebrity in modern times in 1979 when Dr.
Denis Burkitt reported that Africans who consumed lots of fiber had
very low rates of cancer of the colon and rectum, a common and
often fatal disease in the United States. Burkitt and others
realized that there were many differences besides fiber intake
between Africans and Americans, but the logic behind fiber as a gut
protector seemed overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   Fiber has long had a reputation as a natural laxative that helps
to prevent disorders like diverticulosis and diverticulitis, caused
by years of straining to eliminate hard, dry stools. Fiber softens
and adds bulk to the stool and thus facilitates rapid elimination
of solid wastes. This in turn should reduce the exposure of the gut
to carcinogens in foods and to carcinogens that may form in the
digestive tract.
</P>
<P>
   Fiber also favorably changes the balance of microorganisms that
live in the gut and may even activate a gene that protects against
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since Burkitt's observation, dozens of studies have
looked for corroborating evidence. In a review of 39 studies
examining a possible link between fiber intake and colon cancer, 26
studies showed a protective effect of fiber, but the remaining 13
studies did not. A 1994 Harvard study of 47,000 men was among those
showing no evidence that fiber helped to prevent colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The nurses' study, though the largest thus far to look into this
relationship, is nonetheless one more negative finding in a field
that remains highly controversial as researchers struggle to
decipher the links, if any, between diet and colorectal cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Several experts say methodological flaws could account for the
negative findings of the study, known as the Nurses' Health Study.
But even if the study were perfect and its findings correct, that
should not be an excuse to ignore the advice to eat more fiber.
</P>
<P>
   The average American ingests only 5 to 13 grams of fiber each
day, but nutrition experts, including the American Dietetic
Association and the National Cancer Institute, recommend a daily
intake of 20 to 35 grams.
</P>
<P>
   Real Benefits
</P>
<P>
   Dietary fiber comes in two forms: soluble and insoluble. Both
are more or less indigestible. Insoluble fibers, like lignin, that
form the structure of plants are well-established stimulants of the
gut. Soluble fibers dissolve in water and include pectin, mucilages
and gums. The soluble fiber in oats is what gives oatmeal its gummy
texture. You may recall the mania for oat bran that swept the
United States a few years ago after researchers reported that the
soluble fiber in oats lowered blood-cholesterol levels.
</P>
<P>
   In June, just five months after publication of the colon-cancer
finding, researchers examining a different aspect of the nurses'
study published a finding in The Journal of the American Medical
Association that was unquestionably more important to American
health.
</P>
<P>
   Data gathered over 10 years from nearly 69,000 nurses ages 37 to
64 showed that the risk of suffering a fatal or nonfatal heart
attack was 23 percent lower among women who consumed an average of
23 grams of fiber a day than among those who averaged only 11.5
grams a day.
</P>
<P>
   Only fiber from grains, like whole-grain cereals and breads,
brown rice and corn, was linked to cardiac protection. For each
5-gram increase in daily intake of grain-based fiber, there was a
37 percent decrease in coronary risk. An earlier study in men also
showed a protective effect of fiber on the heart, though not as
strong an effect as was observed in women.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, led by Dr. Alicja Wolk of the Karolinska
Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, pointed out that only a quarter of
grain-based fiber was soluble fiber and thus its effects on
cholesterol could not possibly account for the large benefit
observed among those eating the most grain fiber. Clearly, other
beneficial effects are involved, including a possible benefit from
plant estrogens.
</P>
<P>
   But while researchers try to sort out the reasons, Dr. Wolk and
colleagues concluded that their finding provided ``further reason
to replace refined forms of starch with whole-grain products.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this is a good time to mention that unrefined grains are
far richer in essential nutrients than those that have been
stripped down to bare starch. When a grain like wheat is refined,
22 nutrients and most of the fiber are removed.
</P>
<P>
   When refined grains are enriched, only four nutrients, and none
of the fiber, are returned. That leaves the wheat kernel deficient
in 18 natural nutrients as well as fiber. Among the lost nutrients
are magnesium and folate, both of which help prevent heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Two years earlier, the nurses' study weighed in with yet another
benefit of fiber. Among 65,000 nurses followed for six years, those
who ate a starchy diet that was low in fiber and drank a lot of
soft drinks developed diabetes at a rate two and a half times
greater than women who ate less of these foods.
</P>
<P>
   A similar effect was also found in men being followed in another
Harvard study. And as with heart disease, whole-grain breakfast
cereals were most strongly related to protection against diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Walter Willett, the director of the nurses' study, said
fiber was protective because it could slow the absorption of
carbohydrates and prevent surges in blood levels of sugar and
insulin. And, he said, the micronutrients in unrefined foods,
especially magnesium, which increases the body's sensitivity to
insulin, may be important in preventing diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Carbohydrates should still be the basis of a healthful diet,
Willett said, but ``be careful which ones you eat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bread, rice and pasta should be in the whole-grain form, and
go easy on the potatoes,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, for those grappling with a weight problem, fiber helps
to fill you up without filling you out. In other words, fiber gives
you something _ satiation _ for nothing. Also, meals rich in fiber
are digested more slowly and thus hunger is kept at bay longer.
</P>
<P>
   Start the day with a whole-grain cereal (half a cup of bran
flakes supplies 5.5 grams of fiber) and half a grapefruit; eat
unpeeled fruits for desserts and snacks; add beans to soups, stews
and salads; choose high-fiber vegetables like carrots, cabbage,
broccoli and brussels sprouts; try barley, brown rice or
whole-grain pasta or bulgur for the starch at dinner, and eat a
mixed green salad most days.

 &HT;    JOHN GLENN TO HEAD U.S. STUDY OF MATH TEACHING
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former senator and astronaut John Glenn has agreed
to head a yearlong federal study of how to develop and keep more
qualified math and science teachers in American schools.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's appointment Tuesday as chairman of the new National
Commission on Mathematics and Science Teaching was confirmed Monday
by Education Secretary Richard Riley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Glenn Commission holds great promise,'' Riley said. ``I
believe it will brighten the future of mathematics and science
education in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to five high-ranking federal officials, ranging from
Transportation Secretary Rodney F. Slater to NASA Administrator
Daniel S. Goldin, the commission will include about two dozen
business, academic, civic, state, congressional and educational
leaders known for their efforts to improve math and science
teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Riley said he expected the commission to submit recommendations
to him in the fall of 2000 on ``ways to improve the recruitment,
preparation, retention, professional growth and support for
mathematics and science teachers in K-12 classrooms nationwide.''
</P>
<P>
   One-fourth of the math and science teachers in public high
schools have neither a major nor a minor at the college level in
the subject they teach. In schools where more than half the
students come from poor families, that rises to more than half.
</P>
<P>
   Many public school systems have also failed to match or come
close to the higher salaries offered to math and science graduates
by private firms.
</P>
<P>
   Recent international comparisons have ranked U.S. fourth-graders
slightly above average in math, but high school seniors have ranked
near the bottom when compared with their counterparts in other
countries.

<P>
   At age 11, Julie Swail of Placentia, Calif., wangled her way out
of swim practice by picking up the slack in a boys' water polo game
being played in an adjacent pool. By the final whistle, she knew
she had found her sport. ``It was physical, aggressive and required
a lot of endurance, everything I was looking for and hadn't found
in swimming,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Now 26, Ms. Swail is captain of the U.S. national women's water
polo team. She and her teammates will make history this week as
they head to Canada for their first outing in the Pan American
Games. And, women's water polo for the first time will be an
Olympic sport when the games convene in Sydney next year.
</P>
<P>
   The international recognition reflects the enthusiasm at home,
where water polo is among the fastest-growing sports in high
schools and where women's university programs now outnumber men's.
In eight years, women's participation has increased by 1,000
percent, according to U.S. Water Polo, the national governing body.
</P>
<P>
   Water polo is a fierce team sport, likened in intensity to
street hockey. And as in hockey, the idea is to get the ball into a
net at each end of the pool that is doggedly guarded by a goalie.
The six-person field aggressively passes a soccer-size ball through
a gantlet of equally aggressive opponents, pushing, grabbing and
even elbowing.
</P>
<P>
   All of the action occurs with participants rarely touching the
bottom of the pool, which is 2 meters deep, or a little over 6
feet. Each player is in constant motion, swimming up to 2 miles in
a single game.
</P>
<P>
   This vigorous workout is what led Irene Melchior, a 41-year-old
New York schoolteacher to join a water polo club in Brooklyn.
``Swimming laps gets boring, but playing polo with a team is
challenging, fun and my secret weapon for getting in shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who can swim can play water polo, she said, although the
waters can get rough. In the heat of the battle, players have been
known to climb over one another and hang on to anything within
reach. In most cases, it is a bathing suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play a very physical game,'' said Guy Baker, the coach of
the women's national team and of the women's team at the University
of California at Los Angeles. ``In a way, it's more physical than
the men's game because there is more suit to grab and pull.'' This
explains why elite women competitors are required to wear two
suits.
</P>
<P>
   On the recreational level, club teams are cropping up around the
country as former college players take the game off campus after
graduation, a phenomenon also occurring in women's soccer and
basketball. Even girls as young as 10 are strapping on game caps
and learning the fundamentals in community pools and local YMCA's,
said Marti Torres, of U.S. Water Polo.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of swimming programs are now offering water polo for
kids,'' she said. The only drawback is pool size: most are too
shallow to accommodate matches. ``But children can learn the basics
in the shallow end, without having to tread water for an entire
hour,'' Ms. Torres said.
</P>

   Remaking a Mirror
</P>
<P>
   To create the reflective surface of a telescope mirror, a
standard technique calls for depositing a thin _ very, very thin _
coating of aluminum on the glass. This is done by putting the
mirror inside a vacuum chamber and heating up tungsten filaments
that have aluminum soldered to them. As the aluminum vaporizes,
there are few air molecules in the chamber to impede the aluminum
from forming a uniform coat.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, with a very large mirror, a very large vacuum chamber
is required. When most large telescopes need re-aluminizing, the
mirror and its supporting framework are removed to a nearby chamber
constructed for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
   At the Multiple Mirror Telescope Observatory on Mount Hopkins in
Arizona, which is operated by the University of Arizona and the
Smithsonian Institution, engineers and astronomers rebuilding a
large telescope did not have that option.
</P>
<P>
   There was not enough room on the mountaintop for a vacuum
chamber; the telescope's new 21-foot mirror had to be aluminized on
its mount.
</P>
<P>
   The aluminizing process took place in a few minutes last week,
and the results are disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   While it is hardly as bad as a fun-house mirror, the surface is
unacceptably lumpy.
</P>
<P>
   The vacuum chamber is not as high as those normally used for
large mirrors, so the tungsten filaments were far closer to the
glass than is usually the case.
</P>
<P>
   Observatory officials do not know whether this was a problem.
But they speculated that some tungsten might have vaporized along
with the aluminum, producing the unevenness.
</P>
<P>
   Planning a Huge Fire
</P>
<P>
   A group of scientists in Alaska have had better luck with their
project. In an experiment coordinated by the U.S. Forest Service
and the University of Alaska, researchers earlier this month
ignited a controlled 2,000-acre forest fire about 25 miles
northeast of Fairbanks.
</P>
<P>
   The fire, the first experimental one in terrain that is
dominated by permafrost, is being studied by about 60 scientists
from around the world researching such subjects as fire behavior
and the effect of northern-latitude fires on climate change.
</P>
<P>
   The fire site, watershed land owned by the university and the
state, included stands of spruce, birch and aspen. Needless to say,
the experimenters took precautions to prevent the fire from
spreading. By last week, the fire had burned itself out enough that
scientists were being let back in to the site.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the tab for a 2,000-acre blaze? About $115 an acre,
when all costs are factored in.
</P>
<P>
   Charting Coral's Demise
</P>
<P>
   Coral reefs are like racehorses; they don't handle stress very
well. And one of the major causes of stress for coral is elevated
water temperatures. Warmer water conditions that last for a couple
of months (and, research suggests, longer-lasting patterns caused
by global warming), can cause the phenomenon known as coral
bleaching. This occurs when the symbiotic algae that lives within
the coral are expelled, leaving the white of the coral shells as
the dominant color.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists from the University of Georgia have studied why
bleaching happens and have found that it isn't so much the coral's
problem as it is the algae's.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers studied reefs in the Caribbean during a warming
period in 1997, isolating algae and using a technique called
pulse-amplitude modulation fluorometry to determine how efficiently
the algae were conducting photosynthesis. Their work, reported in a
recent issue of The Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences, showed that as water temperatures rise, a protein that is
a key element of photosynthesis becomes irreversibly damaged.
</P>
<P>
   It is the algae that suffers at first from a warming trend. The
coral can't take having stressed-out algae around anymore.

PERFECT PITCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By C. CLAIBORNE RAY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. (italics)What is perfect pitch, and why do some people have
it?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. Perfect pitch, which is also called absolute pitch, is the
ability to name any note (like A, B flat, C sharp, etc.), just from
hearing the tone, without reference to other notes in a scale.
Relative pitch, which is far more common, is the ability to tell
what note is being played by judging the interval between its pitch
and that of a reference note.
</P>
<P>
   Each note in the scales used in most music is a sound resulting
from a particular number of vibrations per second; for example,
most modern pianos are tuned so that the A above middle C sounds at
440 vibrations a second.
</P>
<P>
   How perfect pitch is developed, or why some are born with it,
has been the subject of much study recently, and strong evidence
points to both genetics and early musical training.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in a 1998 study of 600 musicians by researchers at
the University of California at San Francisco, nearly all of those
who had perfect pitch said they had started their musical training
by age 6. Further, the younger the musicians were when they started
lessons, the more likely they were to have perfect pitch. Those
with perfect pitch were also far more likely to have family members
with the same ability.
</P>
<P>
   Brain activity in response to music is now being closely studied
by techniques including positron emission tomography, and
researchers have found that the area of the brain involved in
processing sounds, the auditory cortex, develops clusters of
specialized brain cells that are more active in response to piano
tones in skilled musicians than in others.
</P>
<P>
   While that study found no difference in brain activity in those
with perfect pitch, other studies have found a sound-processing
region in the left brain, part of the planum temporale, that is
relatively larger than the same area in the right brain in those
with perfect pitch and is active when they try to name a note.
</P>
<P>
   This difference was found, the researchers said, even though
most music processing is done in the right-hand side of the brain.
One theory is that the overall contour and melodic functions of
music may be handled by the right side of the brain, while the task
of naming notes and identifying their pitch could be concentrated
on the left.

LOST AT SEA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ John F. Kennedy Jr.'s shocking death is provoking
an orgy of mourning, as overweening as the public bathos that swept
Great Britain after the death of Princess Diana.
</P>
<P>
   It is too much, really. All this emotional talk of a curse and
cruel fate is useless. But we can't help it.
</P>
<P>
   We all felt as though we knew JFK Jr., heir to the most famous
American name of our era. For more than three decades after his
father's assassination we watched him grow to handsome manhood,
bearing with patient dignity the burden of constant public
curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   We claimed him as rightfully ours, a living link to a
sentimentalized past transformed long ago from gritty political
reality into soaring nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   At 38, JFK Jr. was one of a kind. There will never be another.
</P>
<P>
   He left no children. His sister Caroline survives, but she never
shared his unique mystique or his confident public presence. She
did not inherit their father's magical political aura.
</P>
<P>
   As experts searched the Atlantic Ocean off Martha's Vineyard for
JFK Jr.'s downed airplane, breathless repetition by television,
Internet sites, radio, magazines and newspapers drummed into our
heads the few known crash details and the tangled, tortured family
history. Complete with poignant pictures, of course.
</P>
<P>
   The press, never famous for good taste, is overdoing it. Yet the
myth of the Kennedy dynasty is in our national bones. It is just
too tempting to prattle on endlessly, if not always eloquently,
about the emotional impact of JFK Jr.'s abrupt death.
</P>
<P>
   He was the star of the family, its central hope for future
greatness. Despite his mother Jacqueline's romanticized account of
President Kennedy's White House years, there never was a Camelot. I
covered the White House for the Hearst Newspapers in those years
and I assure you Jackie made it up.
</P>
<P>
   But many in subsequent generations for whom JFK is distant
history believe in Camelot anyway, and his only son was its prince.
</P>
<P>
   He chose to become a journalist rather than run for public
office just yet. But there was a sense that he was merely waiting
for the right time, when he might feel sufficiently mature to carry
it off well. He reportedly even considered seeking the Senate seat
from New York next year, but Hillary Clinton scared him away.
</P>
<P>
   JFK Jr. once confessed that he did not recall his father very
well. Nor did he remember saluting his father's caisson, a touching
gesture immortalized in one of the most famous pictures of this
century. His mother had prompted him to do it.
</P>
<P>
   He was nearly three years old when President Kennedy was killed
by a madman with a rifle in Dallas. But he was constantly
surrounded by media-generated memories chronicling the past and
present activities of his parents, his uncles, his aunts, his
cousins. He was caught up in a seamless, relentless family web.
</P>
<P>
   And in a real sense, he was part of our great national dream.
Friends say he was an optimist who believed life was good and with
decent effort could be better. He was a good citizen trying hard.
This is the American way.
</P>
<P>
   Yet surely we can mourn his loss without excessive wailing about
curses and tragic destiny. It was not a curse that drove JFK Jr.,
an inexperienced pilot, to try with a broken foot to fly a newly
purchased airplane over water on a dark, hazy night with low
visibility. It was overconfidence. It was recklessness. It was an
appalling lack of judgment.
</P>
<P>
   But it was his decision, and his alone. No conspiracy or act of
God was involved. It was a horrible accident. We may never know
exactly what happened, but when a plane goes down we often suspect
pilot miscalculation.
</P>
<P>
   JFK Jr. led a glamorous life, but the singular oddness of it
must have been difficult. Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis once said that
had she known how things would turn out, she and the president
would never have given him his father's name. It put a huge neon
sign over his head that he could never escape.
</P>
<P>
   He had not yet reached his full potential. He started a
magazine, quietly did good works, minded his own business, married
a beauty. Could he have reached the presidency? Would he have
tried? We can never know.
</P>
<P>
   But the family itself will go on, as it always has in the face
of personal tragedy. There is the JFK museum and library in Boston
to protect and preserve, perpetuating the glory of the Kennedy
name. There are young cousins who show political promise. The
current patriarch, Edward Kennedy, still strides the Senate's
marble corridors and fights for the ideals of his elder brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as a nation we have a sense of great loss. JFK Jr. was an
American original, our special version of political royalty. He
fascinated us, and now he's gone, not by an assassin's bullet like
his father and uncle Robert but apparently by an accident of his
own making.

IN SEARCH OF LUNAR WATER, SPACECRAFT WILL CRASH-LAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASA's Lunar Prospector is to crash-land at the moon's south
pole on July 31 in a bid to find hard evidence of lunar ice, which
might one day help sustain lunar colonies. The plucky spacecraft
has already found hydrogen, the major component of water, at the
lunar poles.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers watching the crash-landing site with powerful
telescopes on the ground and in space hope to detect a cloud of
water vapor. Dr. Guenter Riegler, head of space-science research
management at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,
said the chances of success were low but ``the potential science
payoff is tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   The Prospector spacecraft, which is at its mission's end and
will be destroyed in the crash, is carrying a 2-inch-long capsule
bearing 1 ounce of the ashes of Eugene Shoemaker, a legendary
geologist who pioneered the study of the violent origin of lunar
craters. He was also greatly frustrated at not being able to travel
to the moon himself during the Apollo program.
</P>
<P>
   Grounded by health problems, he instead trained many astronauts
in geology and died at age 69 in a car crash while on a field trip
to Australia in 1997 to study craters.
</P>
<P>
   So when Prospector crashes, it will not only be advancing
science but also fulfilling Shoemaker's dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that this was Gene's last chance to get to the moon,
and that it would be a fitting and beautiful tribute to a man who
was a towering figure and a pioneer in the exploration of the solar
system,'' said Carolyn Porco, a planetary scientist at the
University of Arizona and a former student of Shoemaker, who came
up with the idea.

 &HT;    A life too short

<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ I have never met a Kennedy, but like so many
Americans, I feel I know them.
</P>
<P>
   My first recollection of anything political was watching the
inauguration of John F. Kennedy. So young, everyone said.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 22, 1963, ill and not at school that day, I watched
events unfold in Dallas that forever changed how we viewed the
presidency. JFK cut down by an assassin's bullet, and he was only
46 years old. So young, everyone said.
</P>
<P>
   America watched as little John-John, just 3 years old, saluted
the caisson carrying the dead president's body. So young, everyone
said.
</P>
<P>
   We watched as little John-John grew into the man. For someone
who had experienced so much tragedy, he was so grounded. JFK Jr.
never fell into the traps of drugs and money and power his cousins
seemed to make headlines with on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   This Kennedy, we thought, would be the Kennedy to carry the
torch into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't to be.
</P>
<P>
   This past weekend, America once again came to grips with the
loss of John Fitzgerald Kennedy. This time the son. Hope that he,
his wife and sister-in-law would be found safe from the plane crash
off the waters of Martha's Vineyard slowly dwindled as bits and
pieces of the wreckage washed ashore. So young, everyone said.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy and John F. Kennedy Jr. will forever be young.
We will never know what these two man could have accomplished had
they not died so young.
</P>
<P>
   And that makes me feel old.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: SEX ON FILM FALLS SHORT OF CITY'S SEXUAL
REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York City may be the most diversified, competitive,
high-priced flesh market in the world, especially in the
summertime, when half the population struts around in a state of
semi-undress. On certain evenings, as the streets teem with
gym-toned bodies and attitudes to match, you have the sense of a
million sexual fantasies in the naked city converging in one giant
imaginary orgy.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, two recent films, Stanley Kubrick's ``Eyes Wide
Shut'' and Spike Lee's ``Summer of Sam,'' and the HBO comedy series
``Sex and the City'' suggest that these fantasies may be as
isolated from one another as the thoughts of solitary exiles
dreaming away their nights on lonely desert islands. Their erotic
climates are so divergent they remind you that everyone is trapped
in his private sexual universe with its personal myths, history and
code of values. That's why a million-person orgy in Central Park
could never actually happen.
</P>
<P>
   What does the elegant, wintry Manhattan milieu of ``Eyes Wide
Shut'' have in common with Lee's sweaty, hyper-macho Bronx? And how
do these worlds connect with the mandarin mating games of the
youngish single professionals snapping at one another in the
television series based on Candace Bushnell's New York Observer
column? Is one more real than another? And what, if anything, do
these works have to tell us about the sexual state of the city or
of the country at the end of the millennium?
</P>
<P>
   The extremes of critical reaction to Kubrick's final film imply
that the movie itself is a kind of Rorschach test of sexual
attitudes. The movie, adapted from a 1926 story with a Viennese
setting by Arthur Schnitzler, is a deeply self-contradictory work.
In the age of the gross-out teenage sex farce, ``Eyes Wide Shut''
is that almost unheard-of phenomenon: a serious major studio film
that contemplates grown-up sex and its discontents.
</P>
<P>
   With its stunning images of the nude Nicole Kidman and of
perfectly proportioned female orgiasts solemnly copulating in a
palatial Long Island mansion, it regards the naked female body with
an esthetic appreciation verging on worship. But it also views its
beautiful women as ominous temptresses luring men into treacherous
territory from which there may be no exit.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time ``Eyes Wide Shut'' is a sternly anti-erotic
movie that regards its sexual license with a cold puritanical
hauteur. The movie is not a turn-on (it is really a horror film
without gore), and the sexual chemistry between its married stars,
Tom Cruise and Ms. Kidman, is tepid at best. The story follows the
descent of Bill Harford (Cruise, toothy as ever), a successful
young doctor on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, into a perilous,
secretive netherworld. The catalyst is a confession by his wife,
Alice (Ms. Kidman), about the fierce, unconsummated desire she once
felt for a young naval officer. In black-and-white sequences that
punctuate the movie, Bill torments himself with visions of Alice
and her would-be lover in bed together, and these images drive him
to examine his own wayward impulses.
</P>
<P>
   But even before Alice's confession, the Harfords' complacent
monogamy is challenged at a fancy party where she is importuned by
an oily, lecherous older European while her husband is accosted by
two lubricious fashion models. At the height of the bash, Bill is
summoned by his vaguely sinister host to help resuscitate a
beautiful naked woman who has collapsed from a drug overdose.
</P>
<P>
   Later, drifting through New York, Bill encounters temptation and
danger at every corner. Visiting the grieving daughter of a patient
who has just died, he fends off her desperate romantic overtures.
Strolling through Greenwich Village, he is viciously gay baited by
a group of frat-boy types revved up from visiting a lap-dancing
club. Moments later, an attractive young streetwalker entices Bill
to her apartment, where he ultimately resists her proposition.
Returning there later, he is informed by her equally provocative
roommate that the woman he turned down left after discovering that
she was H.I.V.-positive. At a costume rental store Bill discovers
that the proprietor is a pimp for his teenage daughter, played by
Leelee Sobieski as a demented, glowering woman-child.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Bill insinuates his way into an elaborate masked and
costumed sex orgy at the mansion. At this grim, joyless ceremony,
which suggests a satanic mass, black-cloaked male revelers who
resemble torturers more than lovers copulate with masked female
models. What sex is shown (the couplings are partly blocked by
digitally inserted, hooded figures to preserve the movie's R
rating) resembles nothing so much as grim, ritualized necrophilia.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Unmasked as an intruder, Bill is expelled from the party and his
life is threatened. It is threatened again when he investigates the
disappearances of two people connected with the ghoulish gathering.
Eventually returning home, Bill tearfully narrates his adventures
to Alice, who herself has been racked by disturbing erotic dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eyes Wide Shut'' is an extended Freudian dream grafted on to
another dream: of contemporary New York as Sin City, in which
sexual predators from all sides threaten to devour the innocent
doctor and his wife. Their only protection from the encircling
demons is a frightened, trembling commitment to monogamy.
</P>
<P>
   Although deeply haunting, the film's Freudian symbolism feels
dated, and so does its vision of New York as a city with a
subterranean demimonde whose voluptuaries would kill to prevent
disclosure of their identities. Watching ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' you
would never know that New York is a city bursting with gay sexual
energy, as the film's sex is relentlessly heterosexual.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in a paranoid way, ``Eyes Wide Shut'' captures and magnifies
a strain of Puritanism that has reappeared in Hollywood movies
since the AIDS epidemic interrupted the sexual revolution. The
late-'90s version of this Puritanism (also evident in ``The
General's Daughter'') equates sexual license with addiction,
madness and violent death.
</P>
<P>
   Spike Lee makes no grand Kubrick-like statements about
licentiousness in ``Summer of Sam,'' his feverish tabloid
reconstruction of the scorching summer of 1977 in New York City.
With its slapped-together vignettes and shrill Brechtian devices,
the film has a loudmouthed tone (it's like being harangued by
someone standing inches from your face and spraying you as he
shouts) that is the exact opposite of Kubrick's attenuated
sepulchral murmurs.
</P>
<P>
   The characters in ``Summer of Sam'' are flesh-and-blood bodies,
not the ominous art-book wraiths examined under Kubrick's
gorgeously lighted microscope. The same feelings of jealousy, shame
and desire that remain guiltily stifled in ``Eyes Wide Shut'' are
way out front in ``Summer of Sam.'' The language is coarse, and the
sexual couplings are frenzied, messy grapplings, not the icy
passionless tableaux observed by Kubrick's camera.
</P>
<P>
   But the sexual realism of ``Summer of Sam'' doesn't make the
film's sex any less volcanic in its impact on the characters'
lives. The domestic upheavals of the central character, Vinny (John
Leguizamo), a compulsively philandering hairdresser, and his wife,
Dionna (Mira Sorvino), pointedly parallel the movie's cartoonish
vision of a city gone crazy in a heat wave with a serial killer on
the loose. Vinny, who has a Madonna-whore complex, can barely bring
himself to make love to his sex-starved wife, reserving his
fantasies and inventive foreplay for his many adulterous trysts.
Instead of Kubrick's metaphysical hell, the price of sexual license
in ``Summer of Sam'' is to live in a marital hell.
</P>
<P>
   Any hint of deviance from the rigidly macho sexual norm in this
world is viewed with deep suspicion. When Vinny's best friend,
Richie (Adrien Brody), shows up with a spiky punk haircut and a
fake British accent, he is treated as an alien. The additional news
that Richie dances (and sells his body) for money at a gay strip
club makes him more of a pariah, vulnerable to murderous vigilante
justice. Ultimately, the New York of ``Summer of Sam'' is much more
recognizable than the icy, half-deserted Emerald City of the
Kubrick film. Whites, blacks, Latinos, gays and punks: they're all
here steaming together in Lee's portrait of the Big Apple two
decades ago. Pizza rules, not marzipan.
</P>
<P>
   Because ``Sex and the City'' is being shown on a pay-cable
service, it can be explicit in ways that wouldn't be allowed in an
R-rated film. And the series, which follows the quest of Carrie
Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker), a savvy sex columnist, and her gal
pals for Mr. Right seizes its opportunity with a wicked comic glee.
Never in an American film or television series has sophisticated
girl talk been more explicit, with every kink and sexual twitch of
the urban mating game noted and wittily dissected.
</P>
<P>
   What humanizes these connoisseurs of upscale dating is their
loyalty to one another and shared sense of humor. They are never at
a loss for a racy epigram. And Carrie, beneath her frizzed hair and
brassy quips, is as sensitive and vulnerable as any Jane Austen
heroine.
</P>
<P>
   The series' sexual ethic is much more flexible and open-hearted
than either Kubrick's thunderous Old Testament morality with its
pompous Viennese gloss or the sin-steeped kitchen-sink Roman
Catholicism of Lee's Italian-Americans. ``Sex and the City''
maintains the therapeutically correct view that two well-traveled
sexual sophisticates can find monogamous bliss. It just isn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   For in this world of higher expectations and educated sexual
consumerism, the old romantic myths die hard. As Carrie and her
friends discover, even Manhattan's most eligible bachelors are a
far cry from the sensitized Rhett Butlers and Heathcliffs of their
dreams. The price of a highly refined appetite is frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eyes Wide Shut'' is oddly romantic in its belief in the
existence of a secret sexual world accessible only to a elite
cognoscenti of the damned. But if such a world ever existed in New
York, it certainly doesn't in today's climate of proliferating
telephone sex, escort services, Internet pornography and people's
obsessions with body fat percentage, abdominal six-packs and
pornographically scaled breasts and genitalia. Despite Mayor
Giuliani's efforts to sanitize New York's erotic culture, the city,
more than ever, remains a sexual supermarket in which anything one
can dream of is right out there in the media display case. Service
is just a click of a button or a phone call away.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ Seated in her wheelchair on a terrace at the
university hospital, Wendy Scott gazed out at a thunderstorm that
had blackened the noon skies and tried to explain why she had spent
12 years of her life traveling from one hospital to another in
Britain and Europe, pretending to be ill so that she would be
admitted as a patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``To begin with, it was just something I did when I needed
someone to care about me,'' she said, speaking with the burr of her
native Scotland. ``Then it became something I had to do. It was as
if something took me over. I just had to be in hospital. I had
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Scott, who is visiting the United States from her home in
London, says she has not faked her way into a hospital in 20 years.
She is 50, with streaks of gray in her hair and deep creases in her
face that make her look older than she is. This time, she belongs
in the hospital, because she is genuinely, gravely ill.
</P>
<P>
   But her past still qualifies as one of the most severe examples
ever known of Munchausen syndrome, a rare psychiatric condition in
which people feign illness or make themselves sick because they
crave medical attention. By her own count, she became a patient at
more than 600 hospitals, sometimes being released from one in the
morning and getting herself admitted to another by nightfall.
</P>
<P>
   Her portrayals of agonizing stomach problems were so convincing
that many doctors resorted to surgery to help her, and she
underwent 42 operations, nearly all of them unnecessary. Her
abdomen is criss-crossed with scars, leading a doctor who examined
her recently to comment that she looked as if she had lost a duel
with Zorro.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is the most extreme case I've ever heard of,'' said Dr.
Marc Feldman, vice chairman of the department of psychiatry at the
University of Alabama at Birmingham, and coauthor of ``Patient or
Pretender: Inside the Strange World of Factitious Disorders'' (John
Wiley &AMP; Sons, 1994), about people who feign illness or induce it in
themselves. ``When it comes to number of hospitalizations and
number of countries, I've never heard of someone even close.''
Considering all the surgery and complications she has had, he
added, it is remarkable that she survived.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Scott also stands out, he said, because she recovered from
Munchausen syndrome, which many doctors consider untreatable, and
because she is willing to speak openly about behavior that most
patients are too ashamed even to admit.
</P>
<P>
   Few doctors have had the chance to talk to Munchausen patients
about the condition, because they generally flee when they are
found out. Feldman said that among patients who seek treatment for
the syndrome, psychotherapy can sometimes help.
</P>
<P>
   Given Miss Scott's phenomenal career as a liar, Feldman
acknowledged that she might be pulling his leg. But, he said, he
did not really think so. Her psychiatrist in England had confirmed
the broad outlines of her history, though not every hospital
admission, and Feldman said he had come to like and trust Miss
Scott, and to believe that her goal in revealing herself was to
help others.
</P>
<P>
   There have always been people who faked illness for one reason
or another, and for centuries doctors have known about such phony
ailments, called factitious disorders. In 1951 a group of
factitious disorders was named for Baron Karl Friedrich Hieronymus
von Munchausen, a war hero who traveled around Germany in the 18th
century, telling tall stories about his exploits.
</P>
<P>
   Medically, the name refers to people who wander from one
hospital to the next, telling tall stories about their illnesses
and seeking unnecessary treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The syndrome differs from hypochondria, which is not a
factitious disorder: hypochondriacs think they are sick, whereas
Munchausen patients know they are not. And it is not the same as
the factitious disorder malingering, because malingerers play sick
to get out of work, obtain drugs or collect insurance, while
Munchausen patients are in it strictly for attention.
</P>
<P>
   Munchausen syndrome is rare. Of all patients in the hospital,
only 1 percent of those on whom psychiatrists are asked to consult
have factitious disorders, Feldman said, and 10 percent of those
have Munchausen syndrome. Some people with the syndrome, like Miss
Scott, simply make up stories and act out symptoms. Several have
caused commercial flights to make unscheduled landings so they
could be rushed to hospitals for emergency treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Others go to extraordinary lengths to make themselves ill. They
bleed themselves, take laxatives, inject saliva or feces to cause
infections or secretly take powerful drugs like insulin that they
do not need. They have hidden syringes under their mattresses,
dangled them outside hospital windows on string or slipped them
into the hems of their clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Feldman said he encountered a patient who had introduced drain
cleaner into her bladder, where it did so much damage that the
bladder had to removed. Another, described in his book, injected
yeast and cornstarch into her veins to make herself sick, but the
substances formed lumps that lodged in her lungs and killed her.
</P>
<P>
   Psychiatrists say that Munchausen patients long for attention,
nurturing, care and concern, and do not know how to find them in
healthy ways. Some patients may also be a bit sadistic, Feldman
said, and take ``duping delight'' in tricking others, especially
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors hate being played for fools,'' he said, adding that
many despise Munchausen patients, for manipulating them, wasting
their time and making them appear incompetent. Dealing with such
patients, many doctors feel they cannot win: if they withhold
treatment, the patient may sue, but if they offer treatment and it
turns out to have been unnecessary, the patient may still sue.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably no other diagnosis is viewed as so contemptible,''
Feldman said.
</P>
<P>
   But Miss Scott said: ``I never intended to make doctors look
stupid. I just wanted to be in hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   Her childhood, like that of many Munchausen patients, was rough,
to say the least. She was sexually abused, she said, and her mother
was distant and unaffectionate. She repeatedly ran away from home.
One of her few pleasant experiences was having her appendix out,
when she was about 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``A nurse would come in the morning and plump up the pillows and
say, `How are you today, Wendy?''' Miss Scott recalled. ``It was
just little things like that, asking how was your pain, how was
your night.''
</P>
<P>
   No one had ever shown her so much kindness or concern.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, she left home and took various jobs at a dairy, a
bakery, a spinning mill and a potato farm. Then she became a hotel
maid, ``cleaning up everybody else's muck and being expected to act
cheerful 24 hours a day,'' she said. The work was hard, depressing
and lonely. It seemed to her that no one in the world cared about
her.
</P>
<P>
   One day, she made believe she had a stomachache and went to the
nearest hospital. ``I thought, somebody will care,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She spent several days there being tended to. ``It recharged my
batteries,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next year or so, she tried the tactic a few more times,
at different hospitals. It worked, and soon she was spending all
her time hitchhiking from town to town, trying to get into the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   She was not close to anyone during those years. ``I didn't have
friends,'' she said. ``I didn't want anybody. If I had friends,
they might find out what I was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, doctors began suggesting exploratory operations to
find out what was wrong with her. She did not want surgery, she
said, but went along with it because it meant that she would be
allowed to spend more time in the hospital. She knew that what she
was doing was wrong, she said, but she could not make herself stop.
</P>
<P>
   But she found that the people who had treated her so kindly
could turn very nasty indeed when they figured out what she was up
to. One surgeon stormed up to her bed, scolded her in front of the
rest of the ward and ordered her to get out. At a few hospitals,
employees snapped her picture to warn others about her.
</P>
<P>
   Like most Munchausen patients, she simply ran away whenever she
was caught. A few times she fled with stitches still in place, and
removed them herself later. Twice, she was jailed, charged with
stealing lodging and food by checking into the hospital needlessly.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, she said, she might have asked for psychiatric
help, ``if somebody had said, `I know what you're doing but I don't
know why.''' But, she said, ``It was always approached in a
confrontational way. The barriers go up.''
</P>
<P>
   After 12 years, two things finally helped her recover. The first
was an operation that went wrong, and left her ill and suffering
from severe infections and complications that took her months to
recover from.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized that if I kept doing this, I might die,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The second step in her recovery was a kitten, left to her by
someone in a shelter she was living in. She realized that if she
went into the hospital, no one would take care of it.
</P>
<P>
   Two and a half years ago, she contacted Feldman, who has a Web
site about Munchausen syndrome (www.munchausen.com), and offered to
participate in any studies he might be conducting. But Feldman
thought she might be able to help other patients, and he put her in
touch with them by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number said she made a decisive difference,'' he said. ``Not
so much what she said, but that nobody's case is as severe as hers
and yet she recovered.''
</P>
<P>
   But now she has become a painful example of what can happen to a
person who is labeled as having cried wolf. She lives in London,
and, even though she has not lied about her health for 20 years,
her notorious record has made it difficult for her to get doctors
there to take her seriously when she is truly sick.
</P>
<P>
   Although she had suffered abdominal pain and other symptoms for
a year and a half, few tests were ordered and no diagnosis was made
in London. On a visit to the United States, she called Feldman, who
urged her to come to Birmingham, where doctors discovered a large
mass in her intestine that required immediate surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, Miss Scott learned what the surgeons had found: a
malignant tumor, too large to remove. The news came as a shock, and
she wept. She wondered bitterly what her outlook might have been
had British doctors paid attention to her when she first described
her symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you've been branded,'' she said, ``it's like you've got
it written across your forehead: `Not to be trusted. Munchausen.'''
</P>
<P>
   She was frightened. ``I'm not really ready to die yet,'' she
said. ``There are too many things I want to do.'' She had hoped to
fly first class sometime, to see New Zealand, to drive her car down
the open road once again.
</P>
<P>
   Now, she said: ``I suppose I wonder what the future holds. I
wonder if there is any future.''

LAWMAKERS SEEK HALT TO MILITARY'S ANTHRAX VACCINATION PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House members introduced legislation Monday that
would end the U.S. military's mandatory anthrax vaccination program
until a government study determines if the vaccine is safe and
effective.
</P>
<P>
   Some military personnel have questioned the safety of the
vaccine, which the military began using last year. Dozens of
service members say they became ill with flu-like symptoms and
severe fatigue that lasted several weeks after having an anthrax
shot. And some of quit the service rather than receive
inoculations.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 countries, including Iraq, possess or are suspected of
possessing anthrax, which is easy to manufacture in large
quantities and can be distributed as dry spores. An individual
becomes infected by inhaling the spores, develops flu-like symptoms
and almost always dies within a few days.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of anthrax exposure hasn't stopped people from
refusing the vaccine: Last month five Marines in California were
dishonorably discharged from the military for their refusal to have
the shots. Some members of various Air National Guard units around
the nation have resigned rather take the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said it does not track the number of people who
have left the military for refusal to take the vaccine. But staff
members from the House veterans affairs subcommittee estimate that
about 200 people have left the military over the anthrax issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon says that number is small compared to the 300,000
people who have been vaccinated. The department aims to vaccinate
all 2.4 million active-duty and reserve military members by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   ``Concerns about the program began shortly after its
implementation and have increased with the number of troops who
have been receiving the vaccine,'' said Rep. Benjamin Gilman,
R-N.Y., the primary author of the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Gilman said during the past month he and other lawmakers have
heard from dozens of service members and their families who want
the vaccine examined further.
</P>
<P>
   His measure would stop the anthrax program until the National
Institutes of Health studies the vaccine. The measure is also
sponsored by Reps. Sue Kelly, R-N.Y., and Mark Souder, R-Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Congress' General Accounting Office earlier this year concluded
that ``the long-term safety of this vaccine has not yet been
studied and therefore one cannot conclude that there are no
long-term effects.''
</P>
<P>
   The GAO also said there aren't enough studies to determine
whether the vaccine would actually protect U.S. forces from
becoming infected by the deadly anthrax disease if they are exposed
to the bacteria that causes it.
</P>
<P>
   The House panel has heard testimony from several service members
who said they became seriously ill after taking the vaccine, which
requires a series of six shots over an 18-month period.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department maintains the vaccine is safe and
effective, noting that the Food and Drug Administration has
licensed the vaccine since 1970.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Department of Defense policy is still to provide a safe
and effective vaccine to protect our troops against a nearly 100
percent lethal threat,'' said Jim Turner, a department
spokesperson. ``It would be unconscionable to put our service men
and woman at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week Rep. Walter B. Jones, R-N.C., introduced legislation
that would make the anthrax vaccine voluntary for all service
members until the vaccine is studied further.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lack of a single, conclusive independent study on the
long-term health effects of the anthrax vaccine on humans has
created legitimate growing concerns among our men and women in
uniform,'' Jones said. ``Until we can determine its safety, we
cannot expect our military to continue receiving what may be an
unsafe vaccination.''
</P>
<P>
   An additional hearing about the anthrax vaccine is scheduled
Wednesday before the House Government veterans affairs
subcommittee.

THOUGHT EXTINCT, A FEW JAVAN RHINOS ARE SEEN IN VIETNAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(mk) 
 By ANAHAD S. O'CONNOR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Javan rhinoceros of Vietnam, a species long thought extinct,
has been found clinging to existence in extremely small numbers.
After tracking footprints, scientists from the World Wildlife Fund
have managed to photograph the rare animal, but its fate remains in
doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The Javan rhino, which once spread throughout Southeast Asia in
large numbers, began to career toward extinction early in this
century. Poachers hunted the mammoth rhino to attain its horns,
which were in great demand for use in traditional Chinese medicine.
During the Vietnam War, the land where the Javan rhino lived was
devastated by fighting, land mines and Agent Orange. After the war,
scientists were convinced that the animal was extinct.
Nevertheless, reports of sightings in the hilly terrain of Southern
Vietnam persisted.
</P>
<P>
   The reports were confirmed when researchers measuring footprints
were able to estimate that at least seven of the rhinos still
existed. Next, scientists set out to obtain the first known
photographs of the rhino.
</P>
<P>
   A team of photographers set up cameras throughout an area just
north of Ho Chi Minh City. Eventually one rhino was captured on
film as it came out of the forest to obtain food.
</P>
<P>
   The World Wildlife Fund is part of a multifaceted effort to save
the rhinos. In addition to the handful living in Vietnam, there is
only one other known group of Javan rhinos, a group of 50 or 60 in
the Ujung Kulon National Park in Java, Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The Javan rhino of Vietnam lives in Cat Tien National Park, 18
million acres of forest put under protected status in 1992. It is a
small area for a large animal like the Javan rhino, which needs
space to roam and search for food, an expert from the wildlife
society said. Under such conditions, inbreeding is also likely,
resulting in genetic defects and possibly the extinction of the
species.
</P>
<P>
   Though the rhinos live in a protected area, they still face
several threats. There are many people living in Cat Tien National
Park, and each year more settlers arrive. The human population is
polluting the area and turning the forests into agricultural land.
As a result, the rhinos are being forced into a small, and
ever-decreasing, zone within the park. One man-made or natural
disaster could wipe out the entire population, scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future of the Javan rhino is about land-use choices,
finding a way for people to have space to live and still have a
place for the rhinos,'' said Steve Osofsky, a senior program
officer with the Wildlife Society. ``With so few animals left, we
must act quickly before there is no land left.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are now trying to determine the number of female
Javan rhinos remaining. They are certain that there is at least one
because an infant rhino has been spotted. If there is only one
female rhino remaining then scientists must insure her safety so
that she will be able to reproduce.
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnamese government is working in partnership with the
World Wildlife Fund, the International Rhino Foundation and the
Asian Rhino Specialist Group to protect the rhino population.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Javan rhino is clearly on the edge and time is of the
essence,'' Osofsky said. ``We're doing everything we can to pull it
back from the brink, but it will take a tremendous effort to secure
the species' future.''

<P>
   Whenever some blithering nincompoop on TV starts pontificating
about the ``Kennedy curse,'' you'll notice that we're never told
exactly who has put this supposed hex on the family.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. According to my dictionary, a curse is ``the
expression of a wish that misfortune, evil, doom, etc., befall
someone.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, these things don't occur of their own volition.
You need a god or a demon or some other qualified and presumably
vaporish entity to place the curse on a person or persons.
</P>
<P>
   So what are these TV idiots saying, that the younger Kennedys
are the victims of generational karma?
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm, perhaps the curse-mongers are advancing the theory that a
vengeance-minded higher power has put a curse on the Kennedys
because of sins committed by Joseph or Jack or Teddy.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's none of the above. Maybe there are just a lot of
people with microphones taped to their lapels who are thoughtlessly
parroting a cliche in order to fill up more airtime.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing more ridiculous than the idea of a curse is the
oft-expressed opinion that the Kennedys have experienced no more
tragedy over the years than any other large, extended family.
</P>
<P>
   Oh really. Let's see, we've got:
</P>
<P>
   The assassinations of Jack and Bobby.
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary's lobotomy.
</P>
<P>
   The plane crash that killed Joe.
</P>
<P>
   The plane crash that killed Kathleen.
</P>
<P>
   The plane crash that almost killed Teddy.
</P>
<P>
   The plane crash that killed John Jr., his wife and her sister.
</P>
<P>
   Chappaquiddick.
</P>
<P>
   Ted's son losing his right leg to cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The auto accident involving Joe Kennedy that left a female
passenger paralyzed for life.
</P>
<P>
   RFK's son David dying of a drug overdose.
</P>
<P>
   Teddy's son Joseph seeking treatment for cocaine addiction.
</P>
<P>
   The skiing accident that killed Michael.
</P>
<P>
   Without minimizing the reality that far too many families have
suffered far too many losses _ think of all the family units that
have been decimated beyond belief by inner-city violence _ I don't
think the average extended clan has gone through anything
approaching the medley of tragedies outlined above. Heck, you can
add up the last half-century's flight record of every family you
know and you're probably not going to come up with that many plane
crash fatalities.
</P>
<P>
   Which begs the next question: How many horrible items on that
list could have been avoided?
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the Kennedy heartbreaks have been lightning bolts of
fate that could have happened to anyone. Far from it. From the
mistreatment and lies surrounding Rosemary _ who suffered from
mental illness, not mental retardation _ to Chappaquiddick to the
stupid and unnecessary mountain football game that resulted in
Michael skiing without poles right into a tree, the recklessness
and irresponsible actions of various Kennedys has facilitated more
than a few of these gruesome mishaps.
</P>
<P>
   At this point we don't know what caused John Jr.'s plane to
crash, but the facts we do have suggest that the decision to soar
into the murky skies that night was more than a little risky.
Despite all that has befallen the Kennedys over the years, John and
many of his kin have a reputation for putting themselves in
situations that are exhilarating, daring _ and needlessly
dangerous. Their constant testing of fate makes the so-called curse
something of a self-fulfilling prophecy.
</P>
<P>
   The parallels between the death of Princess Diana and the crash
this weekend were almost too easy to draw. Diana and John Jr. were
the two leading figurehead icons of their generation, and the
similarities in their lives _ and in the manner in which the public
reacted to them _ were myriad.
</P>
<P>
   Now it appears as if there might be one final comparison to be
noted. Unlike many car accidents and plane crashes that simply
could not have been avoided, these two tragedies were fraught with
warning signs. Just as Diana never should have climbed into a limo
that was to be helmed by a drunk chauffeur, John Jr. might have
been wise on Friday night to look at the skies, consider his own
lack of experience, and walk away from the plane on the runway.

RIDING THE WAKE OF PROSPERITY

 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.

<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ These are the salad days for Zane Schwenk.
</P>
<P>
   Making money, jumping waves, spanning the globe and sipping the
sweet wine of success have kept him busy since the wake-boarding
season kicked off in April.
</P>
<P>
   The newfound spotlight surprised him recently when he was
channel surfing and spotted his silhouette.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked up and said, `No way,''' said Schwenk, who is all
over this month's issue of Wake Boarding Magazine. ``I don't know
how they picked me. I wasn't notified. It was a whirlybird that I
almost crashed on at that X Games last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year's X Games served as a coming out party for the
23-year-old wake-boarding pioneer, who brought home the bronze
medal to add to older brother Tripp Schwenk's gold and silver,
which he won for swimming the 400-meter relay and 200-meter
backstroke at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of what he did,'' Zane Schwenk said, ``and for me
the X Games are the Olympics so it was huge.''
</P>
<P>
   In late May, Schwenk wowed the crowd at the Georgia Wakeboard
Championships with the highest single heat score of the season _ a
whopping 90.66 out of a possible 100 points.
</P>
<P>
   Wake boarders are pulled behind a speed boat on a rope. The
sport, one of the world's fastest-growing water sports, is a hybrid
of skateboarding, surfing, snowboarding and waterskiing.
</P>
<P>
   What just a few years ago was only a part-time gig for Schwenk
has blossomed into a prosperous career. He is atop the crest,
currently fifth on the Pro Wakeboard Series. And according to
Schwenk, who cut back on work as an instructor at Disney World to
focus more on competition, the top-ranked riders can earn upwards
of $150,000 a year. Not to mention a $40,000 boat to the winner of
the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure how much I made last year, you'd have to talk to
my accountant for that,'' Schwenk said. ``But I do know I'm living
a real good lifestyle, I'll tell you that.''
</P>
<P>
   And the fringe benefits aren't too shabby, either. Thanks to an
incredible demand for the budding sport in Europe, Schwenk has
already been to France, Germany, England, Turkey and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   In Palavas, France, Schwenk bested the top European riders in
front of more than 20,000 onlookers in an event dubbed the French
version of the extreme games.
</P>
<P>
   The tough waters of Sarasota Bay made Schwenk the water warrior
he is today and it's in places like France and Rhode Island, where
rough water makes for choppy wake, that he excels. He started as a
free-style water-ski jumper, where he was one of the best in the
world. Schwenk learned not to bail just because you fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps because I've been in all sorts of conditions,''
Schwenk said. ``These guys see rough conditions and are afraid, but
I can't wait. All of these young guys grew training on lakes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother is a tough little dude,'' said Tripp Schwenk, ``if
he falls instead of letting go of the handle and waiting for the
boat to come back around he toughs it out. I think it shows he has
moxy and the crowds love it, but the judges don't take kindly to it
because they want to see a clean run.''
</P>
<P>
   A case in point came at the X Games earlier this month when Zane
Schwenk failed to make the semifinals yet still received the only
standing ovation when he almost fell on a trick and skidded 30 feet
on his back before bouncing back up.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the sport continues to get younger, with teen-agers
becoming the rule more than the exception, Schwenk ages without a
whine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-three is old for my sport, I have to start thinking
about other things,'' said Schwenk, who turned pro in 1993 at age
17. ``It's interesting to see someone 15 come out and beat all of
us.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I still have a couple more years left in me. I don't want
to have to get a real job just yet.''
</P>
<P>
   With his ability to teach water sports after he hangs up his
board, a real job remains on the distant horizon. And don't rule
out a return to his first love, competitive water-skiing, either.

`SHOW ME THE MAGIC': PAUL AND FEDERICO AND ORSON AND SHELLEY AND
... 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes at end of review.) 
(lb) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What you ought to know about Paul Mazursky, aside from the fact
that his first name is really Irwin, is that before he achieved a
measure of renown as a filmmaker, screenwriter and actor, he was a
writer and stand-up comedian.
</P>
<P>
   So the man has a sense of story and a sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Now he has decided to reminisce about his life in a memoir
called ``Show Me the Magic,'' which is one of those titles that
invite a good swift kick in the serifs.
</P>
<P>
   So here it is. ``Show Me the Magic'' may reveal Mazursky as a
decent, dedicated and deserving fellow, but as show-business
memoirs go, its spirit merely flickers when it ought to dazzle and
delight.
</P>
<P>
   Like Mazursky's career as a maker of films such as ``I Love You,
Alice B. Toklas'' (1968), ``Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice''
(1969), ``Alex in Wonderland'' (1970),'' ``Blume in Love'' (1973),
``Harry and Tonto'' (1974), ``Next Stop, Greenwich Village''
(1976), ``An Unmarried Woman'' (1978), ``Tempest'' (1982), ``Moscow
on the Hudson'' (1984), ``Down and Out in Beverly Hills'' (1986)
and ``Enemies, a Love Story'' (1989), this book has its ups and
downs.
</P>
<P>
   And if some of the anecdotes about people he has encountered _
from Peter Sellers and Federico Fellini to Orson Welles and Shelley
Winters _ frequently fail to lead to any meaningful revelation or
comic payoff, what are you going to do? Tell the man to get a more
interesting life?
</P>
<P>
   The early chapters, devoted to Sellers, a certifiable cuckoo in
La-La Land, and Fellini, a warm, supportive and charming friend,
are vivid and engrossing.
</P>
<P>
   So are Mazursky's memories of his early life in New York, his
grandfather's candy store and his love-hate relationship with his
depression-prone proto-hippie mother, Jean, who took him to
Hollywood double features on school days, to foreign films, to the
Apollo Theater in Harlem and to the Metropolitan Opera, where a
dollar bought a seat in the highest balcony. And Mazursky's love
for his wife, Betsy, is evident throughout.
</P>
<P>
   He can be interesting, too, when he discusses why Danny Kaye,
for whom he wrote, had talent but wasn't funny. But as ``Show Me
the Magic'' progresses, Mazursky offers little in the way of
insight or analysis, and his anecdotal material begins to run thin.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he gets around to describing the tensions between
his stars, George Segal and Susan Anspach, on the set of ``Blume in
Love,'' which culminate in an accusation by Segal that his French
eye drops were stolen, the tale sags off into the author's
admission that he doesn't know the truth of the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually it becomes something of a rarity when one of
Mazursky's recollections actually opens a window into the travails
of Hollywood. And when that happens, these passages serve to whet
the appetite for what ``Show Me the Magic'' might have been.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing the effort to bring to the screen his adaptation
(with Roger L. Simon) of Isaac Bashevis Singer's ``Enemies, a Love
Story,'' the tale of a Holocaust survivor, Mazursky recalls a
meeting with the Disney executives Michael Eisner and Jeffrey
Katzenberg at which Mazursky played a cassette of klezmer music and
acted out scenes:
</P>
<P>
   ```How much will this cost?' asked Eisner.
</P>
<P>
   ```I'm not sure, Michael. I think I can do it for under 10.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Eisner was not happy. `Ten million is risky for this story.
Can't you do it for less?'
</P>
<P>
   ```Shoot it in Canada,'' suggested Katzenberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``I explained that because this was a period story, it would be
difficult to do it for much less. `I mean,' I told them, `it takes
place in 1949.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Eisner thought for a moment. Katzenberg turned off the klezmer
music. `Why don't you update it?' said Eisner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Katzenberg's jaw drop. Update the Holocaust? What next?
I thought. `Well,' I said, `I suppose I could make Herman a
Cambodian and have him married to three Cambodian women.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Eisner immediately understood his gaffe, `No, no,' he said.
`That won't do.'''
</P>
<P>
   Now 69, Mazursky has followed a bumpy path in show business. He
got his start as an actor while still in Brooklyn College when
Stanley Kubrick, then 22, cast him as a soldier trapped behind
enemy lines in his first feature, ``Fear and Desire'' (1953).
</P>
<P>
   After ``Fear and Desire,'' Mazursky waited on tables at the
Sunrise Manor in the Catskills; made vegetable and fruit juices in
the window of a health-food restaurant opposite the Stage
Delicatessen in New York; was Igor in the comedy team of Igor and
h, and in 1960, at 30, was a uniformed messenger for the Red Arrow
delivery service.
</P>
<P>
   In telling his story Mazursky skips back and forth in time, and
being _ for some unfathomable reason _ a tight man with a date,
makes it difficult for the reader at times to know when events are
taking place or how they fit into the context of his career or the
state of the world.
</P>
<P>
   He might also have been better served by editors who could have
spared the finished manuscript from saying ``lay'' when he means
``lie,'' Biretta when he means Beretta and ``Un bel dia'' when he
means ``Un bel di.''
</P>
<P>
   But excellent writers and excellent editors, like excellent
films, are never easy to come by.
</P>
<P>
   On beaches this summer, some readers nostalgic for the New York
of another era will respond to Mazursky's mentions of candy stores
where you could buy Lucky Strikes or Camels or a piece of licorice
or chocolate for a penny, of the Loew's Pitkin movie house and
night spots like the Ruban Bleu, the Purple Onion and Bon Soir. And
they will derive intermittent pleasure from his show-business
reminiscences.
</P>
<P>
   If they are lucky, their journey through the rambling ``Show Me
the Magic'' will be accompanied by a hot pastrami sandwich washed
down with frosty seltzer or an egg cream.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps then, like Mazursky in his days as a comic, they can
say, ``Thanks, I needed that.''

 BAFFLING HEPATITIS VIRUS IS ISOLATED, SCIENTISTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Exclusive) 
(The Science Times) 
(lb) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Italian researchers believe they have found the last major piece
of the puzzle of blood-borne hepatitis.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, scientists have been mystified by a significant
portion of hepatitis cases that were not caused by any of the liver
disease's main known viral agents, hepatitis A through E.
</P>
<P>
   But now, acting on a hunch that unidentified viruses might be
found in the blood of AIDS patients because of their weakened
immune systems, Dr. Daniele Primi, an Italian scientist, has
obtained what he and other scientists said in interviews was strong
evidence for a novel hepatitis virus.
</P>
<P>
   Primi, who works at DiaSorin, a biologics company in Brescia,
Italy, has not submitted a paper for publication in a peer-reviewed
scientific journal and has yet to obtain proof from a photograph of
the virus through an electron microscope. Details of the research
are included in the patent applications DiaSorin filed in 1998 for
discovery of the virus and development of tests, Primi said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, other researchers are picking up on the early findings.
Using an unusual technique to test nearly 600 stored blood samples,
largely from the laboratory of Dr. Harvey Alter at the National
Institutes of Health, Primi's team linked the newly found virus to
cases of hepatitis with unexplained viral causes. They also found
it in patients who were infected with known viruses that cause
hepatitis and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Alter, a leading researcher in hepatitis and blood-borne
diseases, said his laboratory was now ``launching a crash program''
with Primi to test more stored blood samples from patients with
hepatitis of unknown cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thus far it is the best candidate virus to account for
previously unexplained hepatitis,'' Alter said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Basil Rigas, a professor of medicine at New York Medical
College in Valhalla, N.Y., and Rockefeller University in New York
City said, ``This looks like it is the last chapter in our 30-year
quest for agents that cause viral hepatitis.'' Rigas, who is a
member of DiaSorin's medical advisory board, said the results
needed to be replicated, but said, ``The data are as good as they
come.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, DiaSorin, a division of American Standard Cos. of
Piscataway, N.J., will announce Primi's discovery to financial
analysts. Dr. Jorge Leon, an official of DiaSorin, said the company
would also discuss plans to work with the American Red Cross, the
major source of blood for transfusions in the United States, and
researchers in about six medical centers in the United States and
elsewhere to confirm the findings in a larger number of patients.
</P>
<P>
   Additional research is planned to determine whether it would be
worthwhile medically and financially to screen the roughly 14
million units of donor blood in the United States and the 40
million elsewhere for the new virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of chronic hepatitis out there that cannot be
explained by current tests,'' Alter said, referring to those that
detect the main types of hepatitis known by the letters A through
E. All hepatitis not falling in those categories is called non-A,
non-E hepatitis.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists noted that the virus does not represent a new
threat, but rather explains cases of hepatitis whose cause was not
known.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a panic; it is not a new AIDS virus or something
like that,'' and there is no indication from work so far that the
new viral illness is increasing through the world, Alter said.
</P>
<P>
   If confirmed, the virus's discovery could lead to an even safer
blood supply. Each time scientists have discovered a new hepatitis
or other virus and developed tests to identify them, they have been
able to remove contaminated blood to the point where experts say
transfusions are much safer today than they were 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Primi's team has named the new virus SEN-V after the initials of
the man in whose blood it was first detected. The ``v'' stands for
virus, Primi said. The Italian scientists have determined the
virus's complete genetic structure, found five closely related
variants and developed tests to detect them.
</P>
<P>
   Leon, Primi and Alter said there are plans for additional
studies to determine these factors:
</P>
<P>
   _ what proportion of chronic liver disease the new virus causes
</P>
<P>
   _ whether the virus is spread through sex and ways other than
blood and injections
</P>
<P>
   _ whether the new virus can increase the severity of illness
from AIDS and other types of hepatitis
</P>
<P>
   _ how many healthy people are carriers of the virus
</P>
<P>
   _ what role, if any, the virus plays in other liver diseases,
like fatty liver and fulminant hepatitis, which quickly causes
death
</P>
<P>
   _ whether effective therapies can be developed
</P>
<P>
   _ whether chimpanzees can be infected so that the course of the
viral infection can be studied.
</P>
<P>
   Before moving to Brescia, Primi had worked as an immunologist at
the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden; the University of
California at San Francisco, and the Pasteur Institute in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   For years he tried to understand how the immune system developed
an enormous diversity to combat the wide range of microbes that can
infect the body. DiaSorin hired him in 1988 to direct a laboratory
the company had created to detect new mutations and variants of
known microbes. The aim was to improve the accuracy of diagnostic
tests.
</P>
<P>
   In Brescia, Primi changed focus and studied how microbes
continually change to escape the clutches of the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Theorizing that hitherto undetected viruses might be lurking in
the blood of immunosuppressed AIDS patients, he used standard tools
of molecular biology like primers, probes and polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) to rid the blood samples of all known microbes and
to screen them for anything else that might be present. PCR is a
technique that can quickly make millions of copies of just one
fragment of DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Another of Primi's assumptions was that if a new virus was
present, it was there in large enough amounts to be detected with
his methods.
</P>
<P>
   Primi used a technique known as degeneration. Each time, Primi
said, ``We selected two samples, one from an AIDS patient with a
high probability that it contained a new virus, and the other from
a healthy blood donor with a low probability of harboring a new
virus.''
</P>
<P>
   They removed human DNA from the samples and used highly
diversified libraries of primers to detect and grow anything other
than a known microbe.
</P>
<P>
   The odds of success were long because a scientist could repeat
the exercise, fishing for new viruses for years and never catching
one. ``It's like the lottery, if you have a one in 100,000 chance
of winning the lottery and you buy only one ticket, your
probability of winning is low,'' Primi said. ``But if you buy
100,000 tickets you are sure you will win it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Primi failed as he tested about 300 samples from about
100 cases of different diseases until he ``found something
intriguing in an intravenous-drug-using AIDS patient'' but could
not detect it in individuals without AIDS. Primi's team determined
the genetic sequence of what they had found in the patient and
compared it with all known genomic sequences.
</P>
<P>
   Primi cloned the material and then found it in the blood of
other AIDS patients but not in otherwise healthy people in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said we have something new, giving us the flavor of a new
virus,'' Primi said. ``But, of course, that didn't mean we had
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding a virus is only the first of many steps in the process
of determining whether it is harmless or causes disease.
</P>
<P>
   So Primi sought to test stored blood samples from known cases of
a variety of conditions. In blood samples provided by Dr. Mario
Rizzetto, a scientist in Turin, Italy, who discovered the hepatitis
D virus in 1977, Primi detected the new virus among patients with
hepatitis non-A, non-E.
</P>
<P>
   Then Primi went to Alter, who, like a number of other
scientists, had failed to find a virus to explain hepatitis non-A,
non-E.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were still looking for a new agent when Daniele came and
said he had found something without telling me what it was,'' Alter
said. ``He was an impressive guy, the preliminary data looked good,
and though I was not very optimistic, we gave him a coded'' group
of about 50 samples. It was a standard research technique in which
Primi's team did the test without knowing what illnesses each
sample represented.
</P>
<P>
   Primi said he ``was very, very fearful when we went back to
break the code.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Alter said, Primi ``broke the code quite well.''
Primi's tests had found evidence of the new virus in a high
percentage of hepatitis cases not caused by viruses A through E and
in only a small number of samples from healthy people.
</P>
<P>
   So Alter sent Primi 200 additional coded samples that included a
large percentage from healthy people with no known infections, as
scientific controls. Again Primi's team found the SEN virus in 80
percent of the hepatitis non-A, non-E samples and, depending on the
group, in from 1 percent to 8 percent of the healthy controls.
``There was at least a 10-fold difference between the hepatitis
patients and the controls,'' Alter said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the SEN virus was found in 10 of 12 patients _ or
83 percent _ who had developed non-A, non-E hepatitis following
blood transfusions during heart surgery. The virus was found in
four of 50, or 8 percent, of heart surgery patients who had
received transfusions but did not develop hepatitis, and only one
of 49 heart surgery patients who did not receive transfusions.
</P>
<P>
   Primi said he plans to try to determine how long the virus
persists in the blood and to correlate the amount of virus there
with the standard liver-function tests that doctors use in caring
for hepatitis patients.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists believe they can clarify some issues in a few
months, while others will take up to two years. They noted that it
took several years for other scientists to show that what was
initially called the Australia antigen was in fact the hepatitis B
virus. Similarly, it took several years to show that the hepatitis
C virus was a common cause of chronic illness.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists are also aware that viruses called hepatitis F, G
and H have not measured up to initial predictions that they were
the major causes of hepatitis non-A, non-E.
</P>
<P>
   But, Alter said, ``this has a different feel to it, and I am
optimistic.''

 &HT;    NEW FEARS ABOUT SYNTHETIC HORMONE DES
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The national wave of vaginal cancer among young
women whose mothers took the synthetic hormone diethylstilbestrol,
or DES, appears to have subsided _ but survivors have new reason to
be concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the so-called ``DES daughters'' are now approaching the
age when breast and reproductive system cancers become more likely,
and experts fear the risk these women face may be increased because
of the drug given to their mothers.
</P>
<P>
   Middle-aged men born to women who took the drug may face a
similar increase in the risk of developing prostate cancer,
scientists attending a meeting on DES research said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   And experiments on mice suggests that even the grandchildren of
``DES mothers'' may face increased risk from hormone-related
cancers.
</P>
<P>
   The conference, sponsored by the National Institutes of Health,
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and DES Action, a
patients' advocacy group, was called to review the latest research
into DES-related disease and to plan programs to educate physicians
and persons considered at risk about the possibility of continuing
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The women and men who were exposed to this very potent hormone
and chemical carcinogen (in their mothers' wombs) are about to
undergo big changes in life,'' said Tulane University researcher
John McLachlan.
</P>
<P>
   Menopause and corresponding hormonal gear-shifting in
middle-aged men are associated with naturally increased risk of
some cancers, especially breast cancer and endometrial cancer in
women and prostate cancer in men.
</P>
<P>
   McLachlan, director of the Tulane Center for Bioenvironmental
Research, said nobody knows what to expect for the several million
DES-exposed Americans now approaching middle age.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to put in place the mechanisms for clinicians and
scientists to be there as these changes occur,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Discovered in 1938 by British researchers, DES was greeted as a
miracle drug in the 1940s and widely prescribed for women who were
considered at risk of having miscarriages.
</P>
<P>
   Although studies in the 1950s indicated the drug did not improve
the chances a woman would have a successful pregnancy, DES
continued to be prescribed until 1971.
</P>
<P>
   It's use as an anti-miscarriage drug was ordered discontinued by
the Food and Drug Administration when a team of Boston scientists
found a statistical link between the occurrence of a normally rare
form of vaginal cancer in young women and the fact that their
mothers had taken DES.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 4.8 million American women took the drug.
</P>
<P>
   The incidence of the vaginal cancers, known as clear cell
adenocarcinomas, peaked after a few years, although the condition
continues to occur among so-called ``DES daughters'' at
higher-than-normal rates.
</P>
<P>
   Concern about grandsons and granddaughters of DES mothers comes
from experiments on mice by scientists at the National Institute of
Environmental Health Sciences at Research Triangle, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   The research shows that ``DES grandmothers'' transmit increased
susceptibility to cancer to subsequent generations.
</P>
<P>
   Retha R. Newbold, a research biologist at the North Carolina
center, reported that grandsons of female mice who were given doses
of DES comparable to those taken by women several decades ago have
above-normal incidence of testicular cancers.
</P>
<P>
   Newbold reported last year that granddaughters of treated female
mice have significantly higher-than-normal incidence of vaginal
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Newbold said in an interview Monday that the daughters of
treated females have vaginal cancers at a rate similar to that
observed among human DES daughters _ about one per 1,000 women.
</P>
<P>
   However, she said, as the second generation of female mice ages,
the incidence of uterine cancer reaches levels as high as 85
percent. Normally, she said, such mice do not have uterine cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Whether human DES-daughter will face increased risk of such
tumors remains to be seen, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's animal data and we won't know what will happen,'' said
Arthur L. Herbst, chairman of the department of obstetrics and
gynecology at the University of Chicago, whose 1971 discovery of
the link between DES and the vaginal carcinomas was initially
greeted with scientific skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe anything until I have data to prove it,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   He said it is still important to be prepared for additional
problems among DES descendants because ``that is the only way we
will be able to implement sensible health intervention.''

FEW IN TEXAS MILITARY FLINCHING OVER ANTHRAX SHOTS
</HEADLINE>
 (Removes ``chemical'' from ``chemical weapon'' in fourth graf) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By CHRIS VAUGHN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH _ The worst it got for Maj. Gary Richards was a knot
on his arm for a couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flu shot knocked me out worse than that,'' said Richards,
an Air Force C-130 pilot. ``And the knot was only for the first
shot. The second two didn't bother me at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The shots Richards received were part of the anthrax
vaccination, the most talked about, and perhaps most feared,
immunization the U.S. military has ever pushed through a needle.
</P>
<P>
   The immunization program is supposed to protect American troops
from almost certain death if they are attacked with weapons causing
the disease. But concern about the vaccine's safety has spawned a
small, highly unusual, protest movement, led to dozens of
disciplinary actions against troops and caused an unknown number to
quietly leave the service.
</P>
<P>
   But in Texas, the vaccinations appear to be creating few waves,
at least so far.
</P>
<P>
   No one at Naval Air Station Fort Worth Joint Reserve Base _
where Richards is stationed _ or Dyess Air Force Base at Abilene
has declined to take the shot, officials report, and only a
half-dozen soldiers at giant Fort Hood in Central Texas have
refused.
</P>
<P>
   But since most servicemen and women have not had to line up for
an anthrax shot yet, that number is certain to go up.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has refused yet, though that's not to say it won't
happen in the future,'' acknowledged Maj. John Boyle, a spokesman
for Dyess, where about 25 percent of base personnel have received
at least one shot.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone in uniform is used to rolling up a sleeve for yet another
immunization. Flu, tetanus, typhoid, hepatitis A, they are all
routine. But the anthrax immunization program has been anything but
routine.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 service members, both active-duty and reservists,
have balked at taking the vaccine. They include 23 sailors who were
about to ship out on the USS Theodore Roosevelt carrier and 14
Marines stationed in Hawaii. Refusing the shot is considered
disobeying an order and subjects a person to a demotion, prison
time, a dishonorable discharge and a loss of benefits.
</P>
<P>
   More than 312,000 men and women in uniform have received at
least one of the shots, one of a series of six that must be taken
over an 18-month period. A Defense Department spokesman said so few
have refused that they do not actively keep track of the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon, responding to a belief that a number of countries
either had the biological weapon or could get it easily, began
inoculating service members against anthrax last year. The goal is
to immunize all 2.4 million Americans in uniform by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Anthrax can be spread through contact with animals or meat, but
it is most deadly when it is released into the air. A person
breathing the odorless, tasteless spores gets a fever and grows
fatigued and can bleed to death internally within 24 to 36 hours.
It is more than 95 percent fatal, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   An anthrax attack is not known to have ever occurred. It is
considered a real threat only in Southwest Asia and the Korean
area, but the military wants every service member inoculated so
that everyone is deployable.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine has been approved as safe by the Food and Drug
Administration and the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention and has been used since the 1970s, including for some
troops who fought in Desert Storm.
</P>
<P>
   But there are concerns in the service's rank and file about what
the vaccine's long-term effects might be and whether it would even
protect them against the disease. The worries are fueled largely by
information and personal stories on the Internet and a suggested
link to what is known as the Persian Gulf War illness.
</P>
<P>
   Early this month, the only company that produces the vaccine
said it is perilously close to bankruptcy. Then last week, the Navy
Times called for an end to mandatory inoculations, writing that
``troops should be given the chance to decline.''
</P>
<P>
   The fear has forced the military to respond. Marine Corps
Commandant James Jones raised the subject during a visit to Naval
Air Station Fort Worth this month, telling the Marines that he
believes the vaccine is safe. Other commanders across the nation
have conducted meetings with their troops and sent worried people
to see doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Bill Tyra, who commands about 1,500 Marines at the naval
air station, brought in a team of medical experts from Washington,
D.C., this year to answer what he called tough questions and to
alleviate much of the anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to tell anyone they can't be concerned about the
vaccine,'' said Tyra, who has taken three of the shots. ``These
Marines are asking good hard questions. And if they (Pentagon
officials) want to get this through successfully, they'll answer
them. Sometimes just giving an order isn't enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of active-duty personnel and reservists at the naval
air station have received the vaccinations, including members of
the Air Force Reserve's 301st Fighter Wing, the 136th Airlift Wing
of the Texas Air National Guard, Marine Aircraft Group 41 and Naval
Fleet Logistic Support Squadron 59.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been the subject of a lot of jokes, but we haven't had a
single person refuse or even attempt to refuse,'' said Capt. Keil
Hubert, with the Air National Guard unit.
</P>
<P>
   At Fort Hood outside Killeen, the Army's largest installation
with 42,000 soldiers, only about 5,000 soldiers have started the
series of shots. A half-dozen soldiers refused; one of them has
already been discharged.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a groundswell revolt against it,'' base spokesman
Cecil Green said. ``Most people recognize the danger of anthrax and
take the shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Richards, an 18-year Air Force veteran, believes in that danger.
He calls anthrax a ``cheap terrorist's toy'' that outweighs any
potential risk of the vaccine. As for the knot on his arm, it did
not worry him, he said, because minor swelling and tenderness are
common reactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a paranoid person,'' he said. ``The way I looked at it
was the risk involved in the shot is nowhere near the risk of an
anthrax attack.''

 By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Science was low on the agenda when two Americans landed on the
moon 30 years ago Tuesday, beating the Russians in one of the Cold
War's most costly and daring contests. But in time, the six lunar
landings from 1969 to 1972, in which a dozen people roamed another
world for the first time, probing its composition and taking
hundreds of rocky samples, led to a major surprise.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries scientists had assumed that the forces of nature
were generally uniform, that comets and mountains, cats and
molecules, all obeyed laws rooted in steadfastness. Newton and his
intellectual heirs often saw the universe as a vast clockwork in
which precise gears turned with slow deliberateness.
</P>
<P>
   But the 842 pounds of moon rocks that the Apollo astronauts
painstakingly gathered and brought back to Earth told a different
story.
</P>
<P>
   Unforeseen clues led scientists to conclude that the moon was
born in cataclysm and searing heat. In time, evidence of similar
violence was seen in relation to Mercury, Venus, Mars and other
worlds that were oddly built, off kilter or spinning fast. Routine
fury from the heavens, scientists eventually argued, had even
altered life on Earth, periodically wiping out families of plants
and animals, including the dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, scientists and historians now say that the lunar
landings helped reveal the secret of cosmic violence, opening a
line of inquiry that is still advancing today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've learned that big impacts were an important part of
planetary formation,'' said Dr. David Morrison, head of the space
directorate at the Ames Research Center of the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration. ``Almost every planet shows a major
anomaly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Apollo evidence of a violent lunar birth, said Dr. Stephen
Brush, a science historian at the University of Maryland, who has
written about the episode in ``Fruitful Encounters'' (Cambridge
University Press, 1996), ``caused people to suddenly start thinking
about ideas that were out of bounds before.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a general change in thinking about catastrophic
events,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout history, leaders of science tended to hunt for
uniformity in nature and to abhor chance events.
</P>
<P>
   As Einstein put it, ``God does not play dice.'' For instance,
the founders of paleontology saw periodic mass extinctions of
ancient life as rooted in natural forces acting over millions of
years. Their rivals, the catastrophists, inspired by religion, laid
the die-offs to supernatural upheavals like Noah's flood.
</P>
<P>
   So too, planetary scientists. Working from assumptions of
uniformity, they envisioned the sun and its family of worlds as
forming slowly over eons.
</P>
<P>
   When Dr. Immanuel Velikovsky argued otherwise in his 1950 book,
``Worlds in Collision,'' taking biblical and archaeological
evidence to wild extremes, scientists battled him in print and
threatened to stop buying textbooks from Macmillan, his publisher.
Macmillan quickly sold the book's rights to Doubleday, which found
it had acquired a best seller.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Apollo landings, scientists backed three rival
theories of lunar origin. All were rooted in uniformitarianism, as
the idea was known. And all had nicknames _ the sister, the
daughter and the pickup theories.
</P>
<P>
   Sister had the moon and Earth evolving separately from
primordial rubble but in the same general neighborhood, as
siblings. The daughter theory had the early moon spinning off from
Earth by fission, leaving the Pacific basin as a scar. Pickup saw
the moon as a small wandering planet that Earth's gravity had
captured.
</P>
<P>
   The theorizing began to unravel on July 20, 1969, when Neil
Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like a collection,'' Aldrin radioed back to Earth.
The moonscape showed ``just about every shape, angularity,
granularity _ about every variety of rock you could find.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of small craters and outcroppings lay before the
astronauts. In bulky spacesuits, they probed the site for two hours
21 minutes, at the end hammering coring tubes through dusty soil to
capture deeper rock. The next day, July 21, the explorers blasted
off for home, bringing back samples that scientists handled like
priceless jewels.
</P>
<P>
   The moon rocks were full of surprises. Experts found that the
samples had little iron, water or other elements common on Earth,
like sodium, potassium and sulfur. That finding diminished the
sister theory, because no scientist could see how such stark
differences might arise.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the inquiries also found that the moon and Earth were
similar in terms of their mixes of oxygen isotopes, or light and
heavy oxygen atoms. That virtually ruled out the pickup theory,
because studies of meteorites had shown that extraterrestrial
objects tended to have unique isotopic signatures.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter theory died on its own without the aid of the
Apollo findings. Studies of planetary dynamics showed that Earth
could never have spun fast enough to give birth.
</P>
<P>
   As the mystery of the moon's origin deepened, scientists were
not only confused and frustrated, but dwindling in number as Apollo
money in the early 1970s dried up. Still, a few persisted.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Hartmann was a young astronomer who in the 1960s at
the University of Arizona had peered through telescopes to
scrutinize the pockmarked moon. Like other scientists, he joined
the debate over whether the origin of the craters was slow and
volcanic or quick and violent.
</P>
<P>
   The Apollo program settled the issue in favor of meteorite
crashes, as Hartmann had suspected. The astronauts found that the
craters bore no signs of flowing lava and much evidence of great
impact forces that had welded soil and rubble into solid rock.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, as the Apollo landings ended, Hartmann was inspired to
extend his impact reasoning after reading the translation of a book
by a Soviet scientist, Victor Safronov. He had speculated that
cosmic dust and rubble spinning around the primordial sun had
repeatedly collided and melded together, forming ever larger
aggregations, like swarms of asteroids, from which the planets
eventually arose.
</P>
<P>
   Hartmann went further. Working at the Planetary Science
Institute in Tucson, Ariz., with Dr. Donald Davis, he reasoned that
even larger bodies had formed, perhaps dozens of them.
</P>
<P>
   One of these might have begotten the moon, Hartmann and Davis
found in their analyses. Some 4{ billion years ago, they theorized,
the speeding wanderer collided with the early Earth and shattered
to smithereens. The planetoid's heavy iron core burrowed into the
Earth. Its light crustal remains, as well as bits of Earth's crust,
were blown into space and then formed an orbiting ring of debris,
from which the moon in turn coalesced.
</P>
<P>
   The searing heat of such a collision, the Tucson scientists
reasoned, could explain why the moon held no water and few volatile
elements. All had boiled away. And the moon's relative lack of iron
was explained by the lost core.

 UNDATED: lost core.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1974, at a meeting at Cornell University, Hartmann presented
the radical idea publicly for the first time. He was nervous.
Afterward, a hand in the audience went up. It was Dr. Alastair
Cameron, a top astrophysicist at Harvard, a man some young
scientists greatly admired.
</P>
<P>
   The junior scientist braced for the worst, ready for a blast of
criticism. ``I was quaking in my boots,'' Hartmann recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Cameron agreed, saying that he and a young colleague,
Dr. William Ward, had arrived at similar conclusions by a different
route. Moreover, the intruder, Cameron and Ward had calculated, was
even bigger than the Tucson team had envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said it was at least as big as Mars,'' Cameron recalled. So
in theory at least, the hypothetical impactor was a blockbuster
about half the diameter of Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Greatly encouraged, Hartmann, who paints in his spare time,
began illustrating the great-impact idea. Eventually, his colorful
visualizations appeared in many science publications, including one
reproduction on the cover of Science Times, the science section of
The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Despite agreement among the four experts, most scientists at
first ignored or disparaged the great-impact idea. It was too
radical, too much like the discredited catastrophism of Velikovsky.
</P>
<P>
   But slowly it caught on, especially as computer simulations of
that distant era of rocky creation showed that the collision idea
was not crazy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, a dozen years after the last Apollo mission, a
conference was held to discuss the moon's origins. To attract wide
participation, it was held in Hawaii, scientists liking paradise as
much as anybody else. A hundred or so planetary specialists showed
up.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, a strong consensus emerged that the radical theory
was probably right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conference was incredible,'' Don Wilhelms, a lunar
geologist at the U.S. Geological Survey, recalled in his book, ``To
a Rocky Moon'' (University of Arizona Press, 1993). Beaches and
gentle breezes were ignored as the meeting participants grew
increasingly excited over the idea that ``our satellite is a
daughter of not one but two parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. George Wetherill of the Carnegie Institution of Washington
told meeting participants of his supportive calculations, which
showed that 4{ billion years ago perhaps 20 or so small
planet-sized bodies sped through the inner solar system, making a
large impact quite likely.
</P>
<P>
   His work, Wetherill said in an interview, showed that sketchy
ideas of planetary upheaval were ``clearly correct.''
</P>
<P>
   The watershed event encouraged scientists to look for signs of
violence among other planets, and led to a flurry of papers. In
time, cosmic tumult was tied to Mercury's lack of a thick crust, to
Venus' spinning backward, to Mars' fast rotation and to Uranus'
bizarre orientation. Most planets have an axis of rotation that is
more or less perpendicular to the plane of the solar system. But
the gas giant is tilted, its axis listing at 97 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Today, debate on the moon's origin is still led by the
great-impact theory, with scientists continuing to probe its
nuances. In 1997, Dr. Robin Canup, a scientist at the University of
Colorado at Boulder, working with Cameron of Harvard, suggested
that the impactor's mass might have been as much as three times
that of Mars.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Dr. Canup, who now works at the Southwest
Research Institute in Boulder, said her newest computer models show
not only that large impacts ``were ubiquitous'' in the early days
of the solar system but that moon-forming smashups were common. Few
of these ancient moons survived, she added, because most were in
unstable orbits.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics remain, especially among geochemists. Many find
insufficient chemical evidence to convince them of the cataclysm.
Some would like to find chemical clues of blistering heats on
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although a general picture may be emerging, many issues remain
hotly debated,'' Dr. Alex Halliday, an Earth scientist in
Switzerland, and Dr. Michael Drake, a planetary scientist at the
University of Arizona, wrote in the March 19 issue of the journal
Science.
</P>
<P>
   But suggestive new clues are also emerging. NASA's Lunar
Prospector spacecraft, which cost $63 million and arrived in lunar
orbit last year, recently confirmed that the moon has a very small
core, bolstering the giant-impact theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a critical finding,'' said Dr. Alan Binder of the
Lunar Research Institute in Tucson, the lead investigator for Lunar
Prospector.
</P>
<P>
   The spacecraft found that the lunar core holds less than 4
percent of the moon's total mass, and probably no more than 2
percent. In contrast, the Earth's iron core is about 30 percent of
the planetary mass. Binder said further analysis of Lunar
Prospector data might help ``pin down for good'' whether the
giant-impact model is right.
</P>
<P>
   Hartmann of the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, who
helped get the ball rolling and who is now 60, said he hoped
astronauts would one day return to the moon, greatly expanding the
number of rock samples and perhaps supporting the idea of the
colossal smashup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always interested in new data,'' he said. ``There are many
places you might look.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The heat and humidity will abate across the Northeast and
northern Middle Atlantic States on Tuesday as a cool front slides
slowly south of the region. Residual moisture in the lower portions
of the atmosphere will cause patchy clouds to linger Tuesday
morning over Pennsylvania and New Jersey. During the afternoon,
however, drier breezes from the north will allow the clouds to
break, yielding mainly sunny skies by midday.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, thunderstorms will erupt from West Virginia to
the DelMarva peninsula as the southward-moving cool front undercuts
and lifts sultry air. The Southeast will be partly to mostly sunny,
though isolated thunderstorms will form, especially in the
afternoon and near the Gulf Coast where sea breezes penetrate
inland.
</P>
<P>
   Sinking currents of air associated with high pressure over
Ontario will promote mainly sunny skies over the northern and
eastern Great Lakes. Meanwhile, a surge of humid air from the Gulf
of Mexico will fuel a complex of thunderstorms in South Dakota and
Nebraska early Tuesday. The thunderstorms will march southeast,
reaching Iowa, Missouri and Illinois toward evening.
</P>
<P>
   The sun's uneven heating of the varied terrain will trigger a
few thundershowers over the central and southern Rockies, but the
coverage of the thundershowers will be less numerous than on recent
days. Sunshine and seasonal temperatures will cover southern
California and Nevada. Elsewhere, a high-altitude disturbance
crossing the Pacific Northwest will spark a few afternoon
thunderstorms in northern California and Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Watery Funnels
</P>
<P>
   Advisories for tropical funnels and waterspouts were issued for
mariners along the upper Texas coast on Sunday. Between 3 and 100
yards in diameter, waterspouts usually possess winds of less than
50 mph and have lifetimes that average 10 minutes. Nonetheless,
these whirlwinds pose a serious threat to small craft. Unlike
tornadoes, which are spawned by severe thunderstorms, fair-weather
spouts typically form beneath ordinary cumulus clouds. Tornadic
waterspouts, which occur when tornadoes form over land and move
over water, are much more dangerous.

   Babies raised on formula are twice as likely to be obese at age
5 or 6 as breast-fed babies, a survey of more than 9,000 German
schoolchildren has found.
</P>
<P>
   The Munich researchers who conducted the study also concluded
that the longer a baby was breast-fed, the greater the apparent
protection against growing up obese or overweight. Babies
breast-fed for two months or less were almost four times as likely
as babies breast-fed for more than a year to be obese when they
entered elementary school, according to the study, in the current
British Medical Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lawrence Gartner, who served as the chairman of the American
Academy of Pediatrics' working group on breast-feeding, said the
link ``was something we all thought was likely to be true,'' but
that the Munich study provided the most definite proof yet.
</P>
<P>
   He added that he hoped ``this impressive set of data'' would
have an effect on the advice given by pediatricians. The group led
by Gartner recently recommended that mothers breast-feed infants
for at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ruediger von Kries, a pediatrician and epidemiologist at
Ludwig Maximilians University and lead author of the study, said
that the weight gap could be caused by any number of ``equally
plausible'' mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers' milk has been shown to contain factors that inhibit the
production of chemicals associated with fat deposits. Formula is
cows' milk diluted to bring its protein levels down to a range that
is safe for babies; carbohydrates and fats are added to bring its
calorie levels back up, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Von Kries conceded that far more children were obese today than
in decades when breast-feeding was out of fashion. The protection
breast-feeding apparently affords against obesity, he said, is
being swamped by increasingly fatty diets and sedentary childhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Parents using formula, Gartner said, should help their children
by planning healthy meals and making sure the children exercise.

   An Early Start for Healthier Habits
</P>
<P>
   Elementary schoolchildren who were taught healthy behaviors in a
National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute preventive health trial
are still practicing them three years later, according to a
follow-up study that examined the children's food and fitness
behaviors over time. The results appear in the current Archives of
Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   From 1991 to 1994, the institute financed the Child and
Adolescent Trial for Cardiovascular Health, or CATCH, study, the
largest school-based health promotion research project in the
United States. Third-graders at 56 elementary schools in four
states participated in it.
</P>
<P>
   The children ate school lunches lower in fat than usual and took
physical education classes in which they had to maintain moderate
to vigorous activity levels. These changes were complemented by
classroom health lessons and activities, and family participation
in some cases.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that students in the study decreased their
energy intake from fat to 31.9 percent from 38.7 percent in the
three years, compared with a drop to 36.2 percent from 38.9 percent
in control lunch programs. Students in the program also reported
more moderate to vigorous activity in their physical education
classes.
</P>
<P>
   In the follow-up study, researchers evaluated 73 percent of the
program's original participants after they had moved on to middle
schools, without the formal programs that were used in the study.
</P>
<P>
   They found that the students in the study were eating better and
were more active than students who had been in the control groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that encouraged us is that kids are still reporting
that they have healthier diets and do more activity,'' said Dr.
Philip Nader, professor of pediatrics at the University of
California at San Diego and the lead author of the study.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Olivas Levins, an elementary principal in the Ysleta
Independent School District in El Paso, Texas, began using the same
program at Glen Cove Elementary about two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children have become much more aware of their eating
habits and exercise,'' Ms. Levins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program has an impact on our staff. Even me,'' she added.
``The staff made a goal to walk 26.5 miles a year. About 95 percent
of the staff reached their goal by now.''

   Aching Backs, Through the Generations
</P>
<P>
   A study in the current issue of Science indicates that one of
the most common back problems, intervertebral disc disease, or
sciatica, may be an inherited disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Sciatica is a painful condition in the region of the lower back
and hip, affecting about half of all people with serious back
conditions. In many cases, the condition causes protrusion of the
lower back and irritation of the nerve root in the femur, the main
bone in the thigh. Symptoms include numbness, abnormal sensitivity
and tingling.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, Finnish scientists from several medical
laboratories theorized that a gene called COL9A2 was responsible
for the condition. The scientists pinpointed one form or allele of
the gene, called Trp, as the cause of sciatica. Anyone with the Trp
allele, they suspect, must be a carrier for sciatica.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists conducted several studies to confirm their
theory. The first involved a group of 26 unrelated people, each of
whom had received a sciatica diagnosis. After studying the COL9A2
gene of each person, researchers determined that all 26 individuals
carried the Trp allele.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, after looking closely at the family backgrounds of
two of the subjects, the scientists were amazed to discover that
all members of the two families who had inherited the Trp allele
had received diagnoses of sciatica. In the control group of 174
individuals who did not have the disease, not a single Trp allele
was found.
</P>
<P>
   One of the researchers, Dr. Susanna Annunen, concluded that
sciatica was ``similar to other common complex diseases with
multiple genetic forms, like breast cancer and Alzheimer's
disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Augustus White III, professor of orthopedic surgery at
Harvard Medical School, said in an interview that the study
explained why ``some people with unusually rigorous lifestyles
never experience back problems while others with normal lifestyles
unexpectedly develop serious back conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that ``though the study shows some people cannot avoid
back disorders entirely, we should not throw away modern
preventative techniques or healthy lifestyles, because they can
still be helpful.''

   Relief for the Long-Distance Runner?
</P>
<P>
   Long-distance runners and others performing strenuous exercises
have long known that they should eat carbohydrates after workouts
to replace the energy stores they have exhausted. Now a report in
The Journal of Nutrition suggests that eating meat, dairy products
and protein bars containing the amino acid leucine after intense
exercise also significantly cuts down on the time muscles need to
recover, at least in rats.
</P>
<P>
   During exercise, some of protein that makes up muscles is broken
down, preventing them from working fully. But leucine, an amino
acid, or protein component, appears to spark the first step in
creating, or synthesizing, protein, leading to muscle renewal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our research shows that consuming food with leucine after
exercising starts the recovery process right away,'' said Dr.
Donald Layman, an exercise scientist at the University of Illinois.
``The quicker an exerciser recovers, the sooner he or she can
operate at peak capacity. When you are at less than full recovery,
you give a less than full performance,'' Layman said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Layman and his colleagues studied rats, which ran for two
hours and 36 minutes, rats and humans are physiologically very
similar to humans in regard to exercise, Layman noted. However, it
is not possible to extrapolate the dosage of leucine needed in
humans to start protein synthesis. For that reason Layman
recommends eating protein and simple carbohydrates like fruit juice
after exercise rather than taking amino-acid supplements.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nancy Rodriguez, a nutrition professor at the University of
Connecticut and a specialist in metabolism, said the research added
to other findings that suggested that the combination of
carbohydrates and proteins after intense exercise ``optimizes the
ability of your muscles to recover.''

 STALKING THE SENIOR VOTER: POLITICAL MANEUVERING ON MEDICARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CARL HULSE   
 New York Times Regional Newspapers   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The developing congressional focus on Medicare is
as much about politics as it is health care.
</P>
<P>
   With control of the White House and Congress at stake in next
year's elections, Democrats and Republicans are feverishly
calculating how to sway large blocs of voters, and Medicare is a
sure route to the heart of older Americans who count health care
among their chief worries.
</P>
<P>
   The twist in this political pretzel is that Democrats _ long the
favorites of older voters shaped by the Depression, World War II
and FDR _ have seen their hold slip in recent elections as the more
conservative Reagan generation aged. Democrats lost senior men as
supporters in 1994 and 1996 and lost both senior men and women for
the first time in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not the same seniors we've been dealing with for
years and years,'' said Rep. Mel Watt, D-N.C., one of many House
Democrats distressed by the trend. ``These people start off
inclined to be Republicans and we have to give them a reason to
move.''
</P>
<P>
   Hence the emergence of Medicare _ and particularly the emphasis
on drug coverage _ as a main topic of conversation on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Democrats know this issue is a winner with
retirees who find themselves with less prescription coverage than
many working Americans but more need for costly drugs due to the
modern practice of geriatric medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The party has also sought to emphasize that seniors who buy
drugs retail at their local pharmacy are apt to pay much more than
consumers whose prescriptions are purchased through managed care
plans that negotiate lower prices with drug companies.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton recognized the political appeal of drug
coverage, making the creation of an optional drug benefit for all
Medicare beneficiaries the centerpiece of his ambitious Medicare
reform plan.
</P>
<P>
   His proposal could cut both ways for congressional Democrats and
Vice President Al Gore, who is trying to succeed Clinton. The
introduction of the proposal puts Democrats on the offensive as
champions of the new drug coverage; enactment of the plan could rob
them of a key issue.
</P>
<P>
   It is no secret that many Democrats, particularly House members,
would prefer to talk about Medicare this year and next but put
nothing into law, freeing them to pound Republicans for rejecting
expanded drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to imagine Democrats winning back the House without
holding senior women,'' observed pollsters Celinda Lake and Vicki
Shabo in a recent overview of the 2000 election picture.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton says he is serious about Medicare reform and invited GOP
leaders in for talks on reaching a mutually satisfactory
conclusion. But Republicans are extremely wary of Clinton after he
hammered them in the 1996 elections on Medicare cuts. They don't
want to walk into another Medicare trap.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans must tread very carefully in responding to
Clinton's plan. The last thing the GOP wants is to be viewed in the
next election as the party opposed to prescription drugs for older
Americans. The party reaction thus far has been cautious, with GOP
leaders suggesting that perhaps the president overreached in
offering drug coverage to all income levels and that his drug
proposal is inferior to what some seniors already have.
</P>
<P>
   GOP lawmakers have made their own overtures to senior voters
with a proposal to put Social Security surpluses in a legislative
``lockbox'' and the offer of a tax break for drug purchases and
those caring for aging relatives at home.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans would much prefer that the battle for the senior
vote be fought on the grounds of morality and values, areas where
they hold the upper hand, according to several surveys. In fact,
pollsters Lake and Shabo attributed the decline in Democratic
support among older women directly to the Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, individual senior voters are complex and
sophisticated and will make their political choices based on a
variety of factors including Medicare, Social Security, values and
even education.
</P>
<P>
   But bedrock issues like health care do help to define the
parties in the minds of voters, and both Republicans and Democrats
will expend considerable energy in the coming months trying to make
sure they are on good terms with older Americans.

<P>
   KATONAH, N.Y. _ Among the annual fixtures now at Caramoor is a
bel canto opera, brightly cast, finely prepared and smartly
presented under the musical direction of Will Crutchfield. This
year's choice was a piece that for most of the last century has
been known only by its overture: Rossini's ``Gazza Ladra,'' or
``The Thieving Magpie.'' Does the rest live up to that brilliant
opening? In a way it does not attempt to, for the work is one of
the period's ``semi-serious'' operas, in which characters out of
opera buffa begin to feel within themselves early Romantic pangs of
emotion.
</P>
<P>
   You know something is going to go wrong in this particular piece
when the head of the household smiles happily on his son's
forthcoming marriage to the family's servant girl. How, then, is
love to be thwarted, as thwarted love must be? Enter the magpie.
Based on events from life, Giovanni Gheradini's libretto tells the
story of a servant who was accused of stealing the silver when in
fact the thief was such a bird. Ninetta, the young woman in
question, is prevented from defending herself by a poignant if
ludicrous subplot involving her father, who, for the best possible
reasons, is on the run from the army. Just in the nick of time she
is saved by the discovery of the magpie's illicit hoard.
</P>
<P>
   The score itself is quite a hoard of brilliant music. It has its
store of Rossinian ensembles in which the characters react to a
moment of crisis by expressing themselves with clockwork
regularity: a couple of these numbers use music familiar from the
overture. It also has plenty of acrobatics for the main principals,
who are Ninetta; her fiance, Giannetto; her father, Fernando, and
her fellow servant, Pippo, a breeches role. But perhaps the
outstanding items are the duets, at once softly sentimental and
highly polished, for Ninetta with her father in the first act and
with Pippo in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Caramoor's cast, entirely of young American singers, was as good
as one might hear anywhere. The soprano Marguerite Krull sang with
suitable sweetness and simplicity of tone as Ninetta, and
maintained those qualities even when the score was demanding the
whirligigs she executed so beautifully. Vivica Genaux, as Pippo,
seemed to be having fun all through the evening. Her singing was
thoroughly confident, done through a broad smile that left its mark
on her vocal color, and accomplished in every way, but perhaps
especially in the ardor of her low register. These two were superb
together in their duet.
</P>
<P>
   Excellent, too, was the baritone Jonathan Hays as Fernando in
his duet with Ms. Krull, as in all his contributions. The nobility
of his voice matched the nobility of his bearing, and his singing
was consistently strong, lucid, direct and bang on the note. His
was a magnificent performance.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Siebert, as Giannetto, was not quite the master of
Rossini's difficult tenor music; though there were lovely moments,
especially at high notes, he had difficulty generally in
projection. David Shapero did an effective comic turn as the Mayor,
and Richard Slade used his lyric tenor voice appealingly as Isacco,
the peddler. Others in the cast included Julia Fischer and Edward
Albert as Giannetto's parents and Marcus Feldman in the title role.
Crutchfield, conducting the Orchestra of St. Luke's, had the
score's every feather in place: phrasing, balance, tempo and
articulation were all handled with great musicality.
</P>
<P>
   That was on Saturday, and Sunday afternoon, in similar draining
heat, the wind players showed themselves no less adept and
beguiling in a short program of serenades by Dvorak and Mozart (the
``Gran Partita''). Peter Oundjian was the inspiriting conductor.
With him now as Caramoor's artistic director, and with Crutchfield
a regular guest, the festival is in good musical hands.

AS REFORM PARTY GATHERS, MANY PONDER ITS ROLE NEXT YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By MAX B. c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Considered a spoiler in the 1992 presidential race, Dallas
billionaire Ross Perot's independent party must cautiously pick its
presidential candidate or face political extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of New Hampshire Sen. Bob Smith, former Connecticut
Gov. Lowell Weicker Jr., and political pundit Pat Buchanan are
expected to seek the Reform Party's support at its national
convention in Dearborn, Mich., this week.
</P>
<P>
   Their interest in the loose-knit, maverick political party _
which its leaders say exists mostly through a post office box and
cyberspace _ follows Minnesota Gov. Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura's
stunning election last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Republicans and Democrats nominate George Bush or Al
Gore or Bill Bradley, it will be the Bore Wars,'' said Russ Verney,
the Reform Party's Dallas-based chairman and a Perot confidante.
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party not only brings name recognition to the
candidate it picks, more importantly it provides ballot access in
most of the states and $12.5 million in federal election money, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've only seen the tip of the iceberg of people who want to
come forward for the nomination. One year ago, people didn't know
who Jesse Ventura was,'' Verney said. ``Reports of our demise have
been exaggerated for seven years.''
</P>
<P>
   Political observers warn, however, that if Perot's party doesn't
unite behind a big-name candidate next year _ and garner at least
double-digit support at the polls _ the Reform Party movement may
be down for the count.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Perot got 19 percent of the vote by tapping into the
public's disaffection with government and voters' willingness to
split their tickets. But by 1996, his support dwindled to about 8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a third party doesn't do it this time, it is goodbye third
party,'' said Weicker, a Republican who formed a new party to run
for governor. ``They sure as hell have to get into the double
digits in the number of votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Known as a volatile, eclectic group made up of mostly political
neophytes, the Reform Party also can't let infighting over party
leadership divide its membership. Ventura is feuding with Perot
over party leadership and location.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will all depend on Perot's willingness to let go since he
bankrolled this thing,'' said Curtis Gans, director of the
Committee for the Study of the American Electorate. ``It does
suggest a greater volatility.''
</P>
<P>
   Perot spent seven years and millions of dollars building the
party. In 1992, brandishing pie charts and pleading for a balanced
budget, the Dallas entrepreneur debated President George Bush and
challenger Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Perot's on-again, off-again presidential campaign
that year lost steam, but still drew unprecedented support for a
third-party candidate. Pundits said Perot's presence may have cost
Bush the election.
</P>
<P>
   By 1996, however, Perot's clout faded. Torn by intra-party
discord, leaders of the party quit, complaining about control from
Dallas. Before Ventura's victory, Perot flirted with being a
political footnote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in 1992, he was the centrist candidate but by 1996 he
was branded as a cartoon,'' said Bruce Buchanan, political science
professor at the University of Texas at Austin. ``His quirkiness
got more attention than his message.''
</P>
<P>
   Perot has to learn when to let go, others said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The history of our party system is that third parties have had
a hard time and they don't sustain themselves past their
founders,'' said James Riddlesperger, a political science professor
at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Perot isn't talking about his presidential aspirations.
He is scheduled to speak at the convention on Saturday. Ventura
said he will not run for the Oval Office in 2000 or seek national
Reform Party post. But he's endorsed Jack Gargan from Florida to be
the next party chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Gargan's platform is to move the party headquarters to
Florida and away from Perot to open up the field for other
presidential candidates. Ventura said he won't support Perot for
president. The Reform Party will select its presidential nominee
next summer.
</P>
<P>
   In what some took as an ultimatum, Ventura has threatened not to
embrace the national party if Gargan loses, and it was the governor
and his staff who encouraged Weicker to seek the party's
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Weicker, a former Republican U.S. senator and political
maverick, ran as an independent for governor in 1990. He is
undecided about seeking the nomination. In 1995, he avoided contact
with Perot and the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not made up my mind at all,'' Weicker said from his
farm near Hartford. ``I'm not sitting here panting after a
nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he.MDBR/.MDNM/ praised Perot for opening up American
politics, Weicker said that if the Dallas billionaire makes a third
bid for the Oval Office, it may impede the chances of any
third-party candidate winning in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get a good, solid centrist candidate out there as a
representative of the Reform Party, and that gives all of us as
independents a chance to unseat the Democrats and Republicans,''
Weicker said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Truax, the Reform Party's Southwest regional representative
in Addison, reacted negatively to Ventura's courting of Weicker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is beyond ridiculous to handpick the presidential
candidate,'' Truax said. ``This party is made up of people who are
independents, and they have strong wills and they can't be dictated
to by anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders probably are a little worried about Smith and
Buchanan taking significant numbers of conservative voters from the
likely GOP nominee, Gov. George W. Bush, political analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly they cringed when Smith, who quit the Republican Party
last week to be an independent, accused the GOP of being run by
pollsters and consultants advising candidates to steer clear of
issues like abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many who want to lead our party _ specifically candidate Bush
_ won't take a position on these issues,'' Smith said. He said he
can win the White House with a coalition of those disenchanted with
the two major parties.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, political scientists said. Unless you have Perot's
money, it becomes difficult for a third-party candidate to win
unless they have the stature of, say, Gen. Colin Powell, the former
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   Those predictions come despite statistics from states where
voters actually pick a political party before voting _ only 29
percent claimed to be Democrats and 22 percent Republicans, Gans'
American Electorate group reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in the year 2000, we are not talking about a serious
bolt to a third party,'' Gans said. ``Smith's candidacy may do
great things for the country and the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to prove how small the constituency of these guys
are. It is going to help the Republican Party candidate appear
moderate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But there is value in having the kind of open debate that a
third-party candidate brings to the campaign trail, Verney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conventional wisdom is always clear, concise and wrong,''
Verney said. ``The major parties think that they own these votes
and lose them to a third party. But the voters own them and they
have to go out and earn them.''

`SCHOOL PRAYER': FIGHTING OVER WHERE TO SAY `AMEN' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., Wis.)  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(lb) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The heroine of ``School Prayer: A Community at War'' is Lisa
Herdahl, a woman who took on a Mississippi town in her fight
against the religious messages broadcast daily over the local high
school's intercom.
</P>
<P>
   But what makes this ``P.O.V.'' documentary more than a familiar
celebration of civil liberties is its portrait of the townsfolk.
Depending on a viewer's attitude toward such matters, they can be
seen as a pious community trying to maintain deeply held values or
as people who have done more Bible reading than reading of the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   To most of the parents in rural Pontotoc County, the Herdahls,
parents of six who moved there in the 1990s from Wisconsin, were
outsiders seeking to upset long-held practices, including various
sorts of worship in their schools.
</P>
<P>
   What Mrs. Herdahl and her supporters in the American Civil
Liberties Union and People for the American Way called an effort to
shield her children against involuntary participation in prayer,
the Pontotoc parents considered their right to practice their
Christian faith in forms they cherish.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming majority of pupils and parents see themselves
as an embattled majority under assault from what more than one
dismisses as well-financed outsiders from New York and Hollywood.
``We want prayer!'' was their rallying cry. In a rare exhibit of
interracial solidarity, a black preacher was invited for the first
time to join in white services.
</P>
<P>
   Through interviews with local preachers and parishioners, the
documentary captures the town's emotional commitment; one man
likens what he sees as the ACLU's attack on faithful Christians to
Nazi attacks on Jews. On the other hand, it does not go unnoticed
that some of the imported Herdahl lawyers are Jewish. Mrs. Herdahl
is viewed by some as a tool in an ACLU campaign to create ``a
God-free school, a God-free country.''
</P>
<P>
   When in 1997 a federal judge ruled in favor of Mrs. Herdahl, the
school district retaliated by encouraging student-initiated prayer
services in the school auditorium before the start of classes, so
in a sense there is a standoff.
</P>
<P>
   The townsfolk, by and large not affluent, are seen willingly
passing the collection plate to pay for the court-assigned
attorneys' fees, which rubbed in their sense of being abused by
higher powers.
</P>
<P>
   That feeling of being at the mercy of outsiders with little
sympathy for their beliefs and customs is likely to be shared by
those who note that the television production of ``School Prayer''
is largely paid for by the liberally inclined John D. and Catherine
T. MacArthur Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts and
PBS.

   A Peek at Couture for Hoi Polloi as Well as the Haute
</P>
<P>
   Attendance at the haute couture collections in Paris this week
is pretty much limited to potential customers, a few chosen
celebrities, certain retailers and members of the fashion press.
But ordinary folk will be able to see highlights of the collections
starting Saturday on the Internet and on July 29 on prime-time
television.
</P>
<P>
   Event Television International, which broadcast ``Paris Fashion
Collections'' for the first time last July, is producing a one-hour
telecast again this year with Isabella Rossellini repeating her
role as hostess and with Andre Leon Talley, editor at large of
Vogue magazine, doing the commentary on the clothes. It will be
shown at 9 p.m. Eastern time on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to showing excerpts of collections by designers like
Donatella Versace, Karl Lagerfeld for Chanel, Alexander McQueen for
Givenchy and John Galliano for Christian Dior, the show will
feature a segment on Naomi Campbell's hectic week modeling in the
couture shows. There will also be the mandatory celebrity segment,
provided by In Style magazine, with footage of stars of the
entertainment world wearing haute couture.
</P>
<P>
   But what should add real spice to the program is Talley, who is
not only knowledgeable about fashion but also witty and colorful.
He probably won't be wearing his white mink coat this steamy Paris
summer, but it's likely he'll be sporting an outfit striking enough
to compete with anything on the runways.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion fans who can't wait to see the clothes in motion can
call up www.fashionevent.com to see 30-second video clips of many
of the fashion shows. They are sure to be treated to glimpses of
the Versace collection, shown at the Ritz Hotel; the Givenchy
presentation, with its Lucite mannequins rising on platforms from
beneath the floor, and the Dior show in the historic Orangerie at
the palace of Versailles.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind cake: Let them feast on couture _ at least with their
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Target's Children, Modeling
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At the other end of the fashion spectrum is Target,
which last week showed a collection of casual fall clothes for real
people modeled by 50 young men and women age 15 to 20. No
supermodels in that group.
</P>
<P>
   Many, in fact, were not professional models at all but
teen-agers who showed up for an open call. Although they were all
slim and good-looking, they looked a lot more like customers for
the Target clothes than the models in Paris look like the average
couture customer.
</P>
<P>
   And the outfits looked as if hip youngsters had put the pieces
together themselves. There were khakis worn with sweatshirts, long
skirts worn with sneakers, and jeans worn with quilted nylon vests.
</P>
<P>
   Shapes were pared down, not oversize. Even cargo pants had
smaller pockets with Velcro closures, and dark denim jeans had
narrow legs. Black was replaced by gray and pink _ the colors
currently favored by high fashion.
</P>
<P>
   And best of all, the prices will be pleasing to Target shoppers
(even those who like to pronounce the store's name tar-ZHAY). There
are T-shirts for $9.99, jeans for $22.99 and long jersey skirts for
$19.99.
</P>
<P>
   At the event, held in the newly chic meat-market area on West
15th Street, Target also announced the winners of a design contest
for fashion students that it sponsored jointly with the Council of
Fashion Designers of America.
</P>
<P>
   The two winners _ Karly Dodson from the Academy of Art College
in San Francisco and Parisa Parnian from the Parsons School of
Design in New York _ were given jobs with the Target design team at
its headquarters in Minneapolis. As Ms. Dodson said, ``You go where
you gotta go.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The T-shirt may have originated as a man's
undershirt, but it has evolved into a fashion item for women in a
range of styles and colors. As such, it is a must-have basic for
summer.
</P>
<P>
   A tank-style by Jockey in stretch cotton with a built-in shelf
bra is $16 at Lord &AMP; Taylor and Macy's. Henri Bendel has tanks in
pink from Jet by John Eshaya, with a strip of sequined embroidery
($38), and in olive from Ashley O'Rourke, with a scattering of pink
rhinestones ($38). Henri Bendel also has a collection of T's with
or without sleeves by Katayone Adeli ($48 to $116); 11 styles in a
range of colors by Juicy Couture ($25 to $62), and T-shirts with
deep V-necks by James Perse in many colors ($45 to $68).
</P>
<P>
   Barneys New York Co-op has stretch T's in nylon in several
colors ($58) and in cotton with low V-necks ($55). The store also
has halter necks and camisoles by Three Dots ($35) and tanks by
Petite Bateau ($28).

 &HT;    Uptons closing all stores
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The parent company of Norcross, Ga.-based Uptons said
today it will close the 75-store chain and exit the department
store business. About 4,000 employees, including nearly 1,200 in
metro Atlanta, will lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Uptons, which operates 13 stores in metro Atlanta, will remain
open until all inventory is sold. In addition to the store
closings, the retailer will close its headquarters in Norcross and
distribution centers in Georgia and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The chain, which targets a segment of the retail market that
falls between discount stores and mall department stores, had been
in an expansion mode during the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   American Retail Group, which owns Uptons, said in February that
it was working with NationsBanc Montgomery Securities to look for
capital to fund further growth of the chain.
</P>
<P>
   But the company didn't find any outside investors, and American
Retail Group determined it was too expensive to continue Uptons'
growth, spokeswoman Shira Weissman said.
</P>
<P>
   American Retail Group will maintain an administrative office
with about 200 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Privately held American Retail Group, which is controlled by the
Brenninkmeyer family, has decided to focus on its core retail
chains, including Eastern Mountain Sports, Millers Outpost and
Maurices.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we are closing 75 of our 1,000 stores, moving away from
the department store business will allow us to develop and expand
our primary specialty retail store businesses,'' said Louis
Brenninkmeyer, chairman of American Retail Group.

<HEADLINE>
SHE`S `DROP DEAD GORGEOUS' AND DROP DEAD NICE, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
 BC- DENISE-RICHARDS -LADN  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By  GLENN WHIPP 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Given the insolent young women she has played so
convincingly in movies like ``Wild Things'' and the current beauty
pageant satire, ``Drop Dead Gorgeous,'' it's a surprise to meet
Denise Richards and find her to be so darn ... nice.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not an act. Go behind the glamorous looks that have
left male moviegoers speechless (and women a little green with
envy), and you have an unfailingly polite, friendly Midwestern
woman who would have been perfectly at home in a Norman Rockwell
tableau _ if Rockwell had been into, say, Varga girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is very nice; but when you look at her, you don't expect
that,'' says ``Drop Dead Gorgeous'' director Michael Patrick Jann.
``She's a walking magazine cover, and you expect that a diva
attitude will come along with that. But she has a grace to her.
Sometimes it seems like she's holding something back when all it is
is that she doesn't want to say anything bad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wild Things'' director John McNaughton agrees that
expectations don't jibe with reality when it comes to Richards.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first heard Denise's name, I (heard) she was this
fabulously wealthy princess who was brought up by her parents in
some isolated palace tower and raised to be a movie star,''
McNaughton says. (Interestingly enough, that description fits
Richards' ``Drop Dead Gorgeous'' character to a T.)
</P>
<P>
   ``So when I met her,'' McNaughton continues, ``I was kind of
intimidated by her obvious physical beauty and this myth. When we
got to know one another a little better, I asked her where she was
from _ trying to dig around a little, find out about the whole
palace tower thing. She told me she was from Chicago and that her
dad worked for the phone company.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for the palace tower theory. Richards laughs _ and she
has a big, throaty roar _ about the way her looks inspire certain
presumptions in people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are some people that hope I'm a bitch,'' she
says, laughing with glee. ``Personally, I don't ever want to work
with someone who considers herself a diva, much less be one. Who
has time for that? If I ever got a big head, my family would be the
first people to put me back into line. I'm a nice person, and I
enjoy working with nice people, too.''
</P>
<P>
   And from the way her career is steadily moving forward, people
seem to like working with Richards, too. After taking almost a year
off after ``Wild Things,'' Richards landed a part she seemed born
to play _ the Bond girl _ in the upcoming 007 feature, ``The World
Is Not Enough.'' Richards plays a nuclear scientist (!) named Dr.
Christmas Jones. Obviously, with a name like that (and with a
figure like Richards'), the actress won't be spending too much time
on screen wearing a lab coat.
</P>
<P>
   Being a Bond girl meant a six-month shoot in England, countless
hours spent doing silly things in front of a blue screen (``Acting
really is a ridiculous job,'' Richards says, again with the laugh)
and the inevitable offer to follow in her predecessors' footsteps
and pose nude for Playboy. Richards declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made a very generous offer, but I didn't even have to
think about it,'' she says. ``It's not like I'm against nudity.
After all, I did that scene for `Wild Things.' And I'm comfortable
with my sexuality. But at the end of the day, Playboy isn't where
I'm at.''
</P>
<P>
   Back to that ``Wild Things'' scene. For those who missed the
movie (it was a bigger hit on video than in theaters), Richards
stripped down to her birthday suit for a steamy menage a trois with
Neve Campbell and Matt Dillon. She knew that by doing it she ran
the risk of being stereotyped, and sure enough, for months after
the movie opened, Richards was deluged with scripts containing
``eight-page lesbian scenes'' and other carnal acts. She passed and
didn't work for nearly a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was hard, but at the same time I'm trying to be a good
actress,'' Richards says, citing Susan Sarandon as a role model.
``I want to have a long career. I'd rather be a great actress than
be a movie star.''
</P>
<P>
   Her patience has been rewarded. Richards was recently cast
opposite Ben Affleck and Luke Wilson in ``The Third Wheel,'' a
romantic comedy from Miramax that recently began filming. Richards
_ surprise _ plays Affleck's dream girl.
</P>
<P>
   She hasn't always been known for glamour. Raised in the suburbs
of Chicago, Richards grew up as a tomboy, playing in the dirt,
eating bugs and hanging out with boys who did the same. Her
favorite Halloween costume speaks volumes: Richards loved dressing
up as a hobo. (Another blow to the princess theory.)
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere around the age of 10, though, a transformation took
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what happened,'' says Richards, who lists her age
as ``20-something,'' with sources putting it around 28. ``One day I
discovered makeup and clothes, and I've never gone back.''
</P>
<P>
   Her father and housewife mother moved the family (Richards has a
younger sister) to Oceanside when Richards was 15. She soon began a
modeling career, landing a YM magazine cover and a print campaign
for Bonnie Bell. She kept it a secret from all but her closest
friends, however, afraid of the teasing that might ensue.
</P>
<P>
   Bored with modeling, she moved to Los Angeles after graduation
and landed parts on ``Doogie Howser, M.D.,'' ``Life Goes On,''
``Seinfeld'' and ``Melrose Place.'' (Richards played Loni
Anderson's daughter, a pretty good bit of ``Melrose'' casting.) She
also made several straight-to-video movies before landing a role in
1997's bugfest ``Starship Troopers.''
</P>
<P>
   She had met ``Starship'' director Paul Verhoeven during an
audition for his sex romp ``Showgirls.'' Fortunately for Richards'
career, Elizabeth Berkley got the part. ``I don't think I could
have done it anyway,'' Richards says.
</P>
<P>
   Most of her roles have revolved around her bombshell beauty, but
Richards brushes her glamorous image off as mostly smoke and
mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people don't realize is all the work that goes into
looking like this,'' Richards says. ``I mean, when I'm on a movie
set, I'm in a trailer for two hours while they fuss with my hair
and makeup. Off the set, I don't think I'm any big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when she's not working, Richards can typically be found
wearing jeans and a T-shirt (sans makeup) and cruising the malls
with her sister (``my best friend,'' Richards says) and boyfriend
Patrick Muldoon (he co-starred with her in ``Starship Troopers'').
She even made a trip _ or three _ out to the cavernous Mall of
America when filming ``Drop Dead Gorgeous'' in Minnesota. (``You
can't go more than 10 feet in any direction without running into a
Gap or Body Shop,'' Richards says.)
</P>
<P>
   Sounds ... nice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved being back in the Midwest,'' Richards says earnestly.
``People are great back there. In Hollywood, if you're polite,
people usually think, `OK. What does she want?' I've had people
say, `You're so nice,' like they were suspicious that I had some
hidden agenda. In the Midwest, nice is nice.'' &QL;

 &HT;    No freeloaders: Kandi's telling the guys to pay up
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The writing is on the wall, fellas. And don't act like
you haven't heard.
</P>
<P>
   All you need to do is tune in to urban contemporary radio, where
Rozonda ``Chilli'' Thomas of TLC is saying, on the group's ``No
Scrubs'' single, that you ``can't get with me with no money.''
</P>
<P>
   On rapper Missy ``Misdemeanor'' Elliott's new song, ``All N My
Grill,'' the hook is, ``Why you all in my grill? Can you pay my
bills?''
</P>
<P>
   And on ``Bills, Bills, Bills,'' R&AMP;B quartet Destiny's Child
asks, ``Can you pay my bills? Can you pay my telephone bills? Can
you pay my automobiles? Then maybe we can chill.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's that operatic, staccato line: ``I don't think you
do. Soooo you and me are through.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a trend that CNBC's ``Money Honey,'' Maria Bartiromo, might
endorse. Whatever it is, it's working.
</P>
<P>
   The release today of Destiny Child's second album, ``The
Writing's on the Wall,'' comes as its ``Bills, Bills, Bills''
single holds the top spot on Billboard magazine's pop and R&AMP;B
charts. It's the second No. 1 single co-written by Kandi Burruss of
Atlanta. And just as notably, it's the second of three current
popular singles that unabashedly discuss the dollars men need to
pacify these women.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time guys have been calling women gold-diggers in
songs, saying they just want them for their money and everything,''
says Beyonce of Destiny's Child. ``And I think girls are just
getting sick of that. We're demanding our respect. Especially since
some of us know the other side of the story: the gold-digging guys
who are roaching off of girls, running up her bills, driving her
car, and then always coming up broke when it's time to pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kandi's just making it harder for guys,'' Beyonce adds
playfully. ``Making the guys come correct.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't get Burruss wrong. The 23-year-old member of Atlanta
R&AMP;B quartet Xscape says she isn't out to slam guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just try to write about experiences, real-life topics,'' the
affable Burruss says in the sun room of her Fayette County (Ga.)
home, where she wrote part of ``No Scrubs.'' `` `I love you, you
love me' stuff is not what I like to do. Everybody writes that
Barney stuff. But that's not how everyday people talk. I want to
relate to people.''
</P>
<P>
   And when it comes to relationships, Burruss is not looking for
the guy with the fattest wallet.
</P>
<P>
   ``People on the radio have been saying things like, `Kandi must
be all about the money,' '' she says. ``I just want to say I have
dated guys who had absolutely no money whatsoever. And guys who've
had money. And it's been my personal experience that when you date
guys who have nothing and you have some money you end up spending
all you have supporting them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to have a guy who has a lot of money,'' she
continues, the diamonds in the large heart around her neck
reflecting in the afternoon light. ``I just want somebody who
doesn't need anything from me. Financially. I mean, I don't mind
helping if times get hard. But I don't want times to be hard all
the time.''
</P>
<P>
   This topic is nothing new in the top 40. In the mid-80s R&AMP;B
singer Gwen Guthrie had her one hit with ``Ain't Nothing Going On
But the Rent.'' Janet Jackson's ``What Have You Done For Me
Lately?'' launched her sputtering career into superstardom in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell, (raunchy R&AMP;B singer) Millie Jackson was talking about
some of that stuff back in the '70s,'' recalls Annie McKnight
Roberson, a 42-year-old Atlanta salon owner. ``But now they're
calling guys .... you know, `good for nothing type of brother' (in
`Bills'). And I have a 21-year-old son and it's offensive to him.
These girls now are just being totally direct.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like for my songs to make people's mouths drop open,''
Burruss says. ``I like for people to hear something and say, `I can
not believe she said that.''' But guys will have their say too.
Burruss and boyfriend/producer Kevin ``She'kspere'' Briggs have
completed upcoming songs for R&AMP;B singers Montell Jordan (``This Is
How We Do It'') and Atlanta's Sam Salter (``After 12, Before 6'').
</P>
<P>
   So there'll be some equal opportunity berating coming to your
radio soon.

INDONESIA PREPARES FOR VIOLENT BREAK WITH EAST TIMOR

<P>
   DILI, East Timor _ Indonesia is preparing to relinquish control
of East Timor after 23 years of occupation and believes that those
who want independence are likely to win an upcoming referendum,
says a supposedly authentic internal government report that has
been made available to reporters by advocates of independence.
</P>
<P>
   The report predicted violence if independence forces won and
also anticipated that non-Timorese who control many businesses
would leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been left behind in the effort to win the hearts of
the people,'' said the document dated July 3 and signed by H.R.
Garnadi, the coordinating minister for politics and
security/internal political affairs. The document was released by
the East Timor International Support Center, a group that supports
independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still time to confront the situation, but time is
running out,'' it says, adding that the option of remaining part of
Indonesia with some autonomy looks likely to be defeated.
</P>
<P>
   The six-page document is addressed to Feisal Tandjung, a former
armed forces chief who is coordinating minister for political and
security affairs. It is titled ``General Assessment if Option 1
Fails.''
</P>
<P>
   Late next month, an estimated 400,000 East Timorese are to
choose between broad autonomy within Indonesia, Option 1, or
outright independence, Option 2. The vote is being organized by the
United Nations under an agreement signed May 5 by Indonesia and
East Timor's former colonial ruler, Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   The document refers in glowing terms to the pro-Indonesian
militias, believed responsible for a spate of bloody political
violence since January that has left more than 100 people dead,
mostly unarmed civilians supporters of independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot ignore the attitude of the indigenous East Timorese
militias that were recruited from the pro-integration groups,'' it
says. ``They are heroes of integration.''
</P>
<P>
   It accused the United Nations of bias toward independence and
adding that Indonesian authorities in East Timor had been
``powerless to match'' maneuvers by U.N. officials in East Timor,
supported by local personnel opposed to remaining within Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 after Portugal, faced with
a revolution in Lisbon, abandoned its former colony, which it
settled beginning in the 1650s. In 1976 Indonesia annexed East
Timor as its 27th province in a move the United Nations never
recognized.
</P>
<P>
   The early years of Indonesian military occupation were brutal,
with estimates of 200,000 people dead from massacres, disease and
famine. Following years of suppression of independent movements
under former President Suharto, new President B.J. Habibie made an
offer in January to let the East Timorese decide their future.
</P>
<P>
   The document appears to be more than a security memo. Instead,
it seems to recommend a broader policy position. The U.N.
Assistance Mission in East Timor is not questioning the document's
authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   If voters reject the proposal to remain with Indonesia, the
report lists a five-point summary of recommendations that includes
a plan to remove Indonesian civil servants and migrants.
</P>
<P>
   It also recommends that all elements of the Indonesian armed
forces ``be put on alert and prepared for action near the
evacuation areas.''
</P>
<P>
   West Timor ``must be made ready to receive huge numbers of
refugees and their security forces,'' it says. ``The evacuation
routes must be planned and secured, possibly destroying facilities
and other vital objects.''
</P>
<P>
   The report calls on the Indonesian government to confirm its
commitment to the militias believed responsible for the recent
violence. It also predicted a violent and bloody payback by
pro-independence fighters if they win.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Indonesian government will perhaps feel relieved of a
heavy burden of responsibility for the prolonged and seemingly
unsolvable problem of East Timor, which has only besmirched the
nation's image in the eyes of the international community,'' the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, the pro-integration forces are prepared to take up
the present position of the anti-integration forces. In such a
case, the Indonesian government will not be able to wash its hands
of the problem, if later the integration supporters are
butchered.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also said that pro-independence fighters had received
``airdrops of a significant number of firearms'' and that
regardless of the outcome at the ballot there was little prospect
of the weapons being surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   A victory for independence would severely disrupt the economic
and social structure of East Timor, the report says, adding: ``It
is inevitable that society will be disrupted. The economy will be
paralyzed, as the business people are generally migrants.''
</P>
<P>
   Government workers in East Timor who favor independence are
described as ``not that capable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At best,'' the report predicted, ``aspects of society will be
controlled by the church,'' while the United Nations and Australia
will control the rest.

 &HT;    Times chief brings changes
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's no question that The New York Times is a-changing. The
once gray newspaper is more colorful, both graphically and
editorially. The man behind the evolution is Arthur Sulzberger Jr.,
the brash great-grandson of Times founder Adolph Ochs. In an
insightful New Yorker ($3) profile, Susan Tifft and Alex Jones
trace Sulzberger's career from his days as a young reporter in
Raleigh to his ascension to the chairmanship of The New York Times
Co. Along the way, the 48-year-old Sulzberger has introduced color
pictures into the paper, granted company benefits to same-sex
couples and increased the hiring of minorities.
</P>
<P>
   His next major challenges are dealing with the Internet and
finding a successor to Joseph Lelyveld when Lelyveld retires as
executive editor. Jones and Tifft speculate that editorial page
editor Howell Raines has Sulzberger's ear _ and the inside track.
Raines, a Birmingham native and a reporter for The Atlanta
Constitution in the 1970s, is credited with making the editorial
page sharper-edged _ particularly in regard to the Clinton
administration. When the president complained, Sulzberger told him
to think of the editorials as tough love. ``Well,'' Clinton said
wearily, ``don't forget the love part.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A fitting role: When Halle Berry was considering taking the
role of Dorothy Dandridge for HBO, she took home a gown the late
actress once wore on ``The Ed Sullivan Show.'' The dress fit every
curve, Berry says in an interview in Ebony ($2.50). ``It felt like
validation.'' But when she began hearing strange noises at night
and saw a doll's dress floating in front of the gown, she sent it
back. ``I thought about it all night and decided that I was
supposed to use the dress for inspiration, but the time had come to
give it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Dandridge's death in 1965 was attributed to an
accidental drug overdose, Berry believes it was suicide. ``I know
how a person can feel so alone that she just wants to go to sleep,
because I have been there,'' she says, referring to the time
shortly after her divorce from David Justice when she considered
taking her own life.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  All about Love: In an issue that its editors describe as
``sex-obsessed,'' Jane ($2.95) talks to rock star Courtney Love
about ... well, everything from pornography to her jealousy over
Alanis Morissette. Elsewhere in the magazine, a survey of women
reveals the funniest and freakiest things that have happened behind
closed bedroom doors. The most embarrassing? One reader, while
rummaging around in her partner's room, found a 16mm film of his
grandfather dancing naked.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Frightful films: ``The Haunting'' is likely to raise a few
goose bumps this summer, but how does it compare with scary
classics such as ``Psycho''? As a reminder, Entertainment Weekly
($2.99) has compiled a list of the top 25 nightmare-causers. The
five scariest are ``The Exorcist,'' ``The Texas Chainsaw
Massacre,'' ``Alien,'' ``The Silence of the Lambs'' and
``Halloween.'' Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece, by the way, is No.
7.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Camera shy: Catherine Zeta-Jones, who demonstrated her
swordsmanship in ``The Mask of Zorro'' and co-stars with Liam
Neeson in ``The Haunting,'' apparently is more afraid of the
paparazzi than the supernatural. She tells Glamour ($2.99) that she
finds photographers ``profoundly intimidating.''

SHAKESPEARE TROUPE TO BUY BERKSHIRE ARTS CENTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (fb) 
 By ALLAN KOZINN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Music Foundation, a nonprofit organization for the
promotion of American music, has shelved its plan to establish a
performing arts complex with an educational center and a musicians'
retirement community in the Berkshires. Over the weekend, the
organization agreed to sell its 63-acre site in Lenox, Mass., near
Tanglewood, to Shakespeare &AMP; Company for $5.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare &AMP; Company has presented a summer and fall
Shakespeare festival at the Edith Wharton house in Lenox since
1978, but has been looking for a new home since January. At that
time, Edith Wharton Restoration Inc., which runs the historic
house, said it would not renew the company's lease to three of the
four theaters it was using on the property after the current lease
expires in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The company currently presents 14 productions a year. During the
height of its season, in July and August, it offers four to six
performances a day at the four theaters at the Wharton house and a
fifth in Lenox.
</P>
<P>
   Tina Packer, the founder and artistic director of the company,
said on Monday that in searching for a new site, she was hoping to
remain in or near Lenox, partly because the company had built a
loyal audience there, but also because the company has a
longstanding educational program in the area's schools that it does
not want to abandon.
</P>
<P>
   Besides giving performances, the troupe presents workshops at
colleges all over New England, and it was also seeking a site where
its activities could be centralized.
</P>
<P>
   The music foundation acquired the property in 1993 in a complex
transaction in which it received the land as a donation and bought
the buildings on the site _ including the 1,200-seat Berkshire
Performing Arts Theater and about two dozen dormitories _ for $2.1
million. The donors, Elizabeth and Jonas Dovydenas, had been
awarded the property in 1987 after Mrs. Dovydenas successfully sued
Bible Speaks, a Christian organization that owned the site at the
time, for the return of a $6 million donation.
</P>
<P>
   When the foundation acquired the property, it announced an
ambitious plan to turn it into a music education center and a
retirement home for musicians. It also began presenting concerts at
the Performing Arts Theater and a renovated 500-seat hall, the
Center Theater.
</P>
<P>
   The concerts have been almost exclusively of popular music,
although Tom Heany, the foundation's director of programming, said
that classical music figured more heavily in the foundation's
educational programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tanglewood is a few miles down the road,'' Heany said, ``and
we'd be nuts to try to compete with them.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Virtually from the start, the foundation's project was plagued
by both financial problems and altercations with city and state
officials over everything from zoning laws to promised grant money.
And the foundation found it difficult to raise money for its music
center and retirement community while spending about $300,000
simply to maintain the property.
</P>
<P>
   Packer said she had approached Gloria Pennington, the president
of the music foundation, to discuss buying the property only three
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew the property, because we've rented housing there,''
Packer said. ``And of all the places we knew, this was the place
that we felt would suit us the best. We didn't think there was a
chance that it would be on the market, but we were about to begin
negotiations on another piece of property, and I thought, let's not
begin those negotiations until we're absolutely sure we can't have
this. So I went to Gloria and said, if there's any chance, I'd like
to buy the property.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the foundation was conducting feasibility
studies and reconsidering its future in Lenox, and at a board
meeting a few days after Packer's offer, a deal was in the works.
Packer said her company already spent $300,000 to house the 200
actors, directors, designers and technicians who work at the
festival every summer, so the cost of maintaining the property
would be offset by savings in property rentals.
</P>
<P>
   The company will move its activities to its new home gradually
between December and the end of its lease at the Wharton house in
2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have to do a lot more programming to make it
cost-effective,'' Packer said. ``But we wanted to do more
programming anyway.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Q. This used to be a wonderful company until the
new owners took over. Their management style is harsh, controlling
and cheap. Many of my co-workers have bailed out, and I am thinking
of leaving, too. But I have invested many years here, and it is
hard for me to think about going to a new company. Is there a way
to demonstrate to the new owners that they are destroying the
business? B.E. &QL; 
A. Although you may not want to join a new company, the fact is
that a new company has joined you. With a complete change in a
company's ownership and leadership, there can be a complete change
in the culture, values and work atmosphere. And, in your situation,
it does not sound like this was a change for the better.
</P>
<P>
   You want to bring back your old wonderful company, but the
reality is that when the new owners moved in, your old company
moved out. You can talk to the new owners about the changes that
are being made and even suggest that management hold a meeting to
discuss the employees' concerns, inputs and suggestions. The owners
may surprise you and give this suggestion a try, but they do not
seem to be particularly interested in what the employees have to
say.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that you already have a clear idea of where your
company is going, and now is the time to decide if you should be
going with it, or if you should just be going. &QL; 
Q. I work in a transportation reservation department. We deal with
irate customers only and were told that if a complaint letter is
received and our name is mentioned, we would be terminated. Now we
are terrified and come to work each day stressed and worried that
we could lose our jobs. Does management have the right to address
an entire department this way and threaten jobs? M.I. &QL; 
A. It sounds like you should have reservations about working in
this reservation department. By basing their policy on employee
performance and applying it equally to everyone in your department,
management may have the right to implement such a policy, but that
does not make the policy right.
</P>
<P>
   Management is obviously concerned about customer satisfaction
and has adopted an aggressively negative policy to attempt to force
the employees to maintain positive customer service. The problem is
that this approach will also force the employees to become
increasingly stressed, insecure and dissatisfied, and this will
ultimately undermine customer service, and a lot more.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that any customer can write a letter of complaint.
This complaint may be justified or may just as easily be the
rantings of a chronic complainer. It makes far more sense for
management to implement a policy that calls for a review,
investigation and discussion of these letters rather than making a
knee-jerk determination and termination.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is important for management to place a great deal of
attention on customer satisfaction, this does not mean that
management should ignore employee satisfaction. &QL; 
Q. There is a person in our office who is always talking out loud
about the chores she is completing, whether she is filing papers,
entering data on the computer or rearranging her desk. It is a
little distracting and a little strange, and we are not sure if we
should say something. What do you think? G.P. &QL; 
A. When you have a co-worker who feels a need to provide a running
commentary on her day's activities, there is no automatic step to
take. Your actions will best be determined by what you are actually
seeing and hearing from her.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if you have a generally friendly,
communicative and productive working relationship with her, you can
tell her that this aspect of her behavior is a little distracting.
There are some overly oral people who know that they can
occasionally jump off the verbal deep end, and some constructive
feedback can help them bring this under control. Her reaction to
this feedback will tell you if any further action is needed.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, if your working relationship is not great, if
you have any fears about approaching her, or if your productive
feedback is not well received, then you should discuss the
situation with your manager. Management is typically interested in
taking action on any issues that may be distracting or disturbing
to the employees, and it sounds like this is such an issue.
</P>
<P>
   It is interesting to note that people can block out all sorts of
background noise at work. With this in mind, since you describe her
constant commentary as ``a little distracting,'' perhaps you can do
a little blocking out. &QL;

 &HT;    CLINTON SAYS HE WILL CONTACT SYRIA'S LEADER TO URGE TALKS WITH
ISRAEL
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON President Clinton said Monday he will contact Syria's
President Hafez Assad to urge him to seize ``a golden opportunity''
to open peace talks with Israel's new government.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said his contact with Assad _ expected within days _
would mark the next step in a fresh push to rekindle long-stalled
peace talks among Israel's new prime minister, Ehud Barak, and his
country's Arab foes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton warned, though, that there were no easy solutions to the
life and death issues that have divided Israelis and Arabs for five
decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way ahead will be difficult,'' Clinton told reporters
during a joint press conference with Barak, wrapping up several
days of meetings between the two leaders. ``There are hard
decisions to be made.''
</P>
<P>
   While pressing for peace, Clinton also agreed to increase U.S.
military aid to Israel by roughly one-third over the coming decade.
That aid, currently around $1.9 billion a year, would rise to $2.4
billion. It would be used chiefly to boost Israel's anti-missile
defenses and to improve its anti-terrorism efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Barak pledged to ``leave no stone unturned'' in his effort to
negotiate a comprehensive Mideast peace over the next 15 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not talking about a miraculous solution, magic
solution, that will drop upon us from heaven in three weeks,'' said
Barak, ``and we are not intending to drag our feet for another
three years.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said it was up to Israel and its principle adversaries _
the Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon _ to pursue peace negotiations
at their own pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's for the United States to set the time
tables here,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the United States has much influence over the peace
process, and Clinton has devoted more time and diplomatic currency
to the issue than any other president since Jimmy Carter brokered
the historic Camp David peace accords between Israel and Egypt two
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   A comprehensive peace among Israel and its Arab enemies along
the time line Barak proposed could result in a dramatic signing
ceremony on the White House lawn by sometime next fall _ perhaps in
time for the 2000 presidential and congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with Barak on Monday, Clinton said he would
contact Assad, who presides over a country the State Department
regards as a pariah because of its long-time support for groups the
U.S. government regards as terrorist organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hinted that U.S.-Syrian relations could quickly thaw if
Assad takes steps to disassociate his government from such groups _
an offer Assad has resisted in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would contact Assad to update him on his
meetings with Barak and to urge him to renew peace talks with
Israel that ran aground three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a golden opportunity now to resume that process, and I
hope he will do so,'' said Clinton. ``I will make it known to
President Assad (that)...this is an important time to restart the
peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   Assad wants Israel to return the Golan Heights, a strategically
important piece of territory Israel seized from Syria in 1967 after
Syrian artillery batteries used the ground to shell Jewish
settlements in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement between Israel and Syria is widely thought to be
the gateway to an Israeli-Lebanese accord.
</P>
<P>
   On a parallel track, Barak said he is laying the groundwork for
negotiations with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to resolve
short-term issues. One of those issues is Israel's pledge to return
to Palestinian control an additional 13.1 percent of occupied
territories in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, said Barak, Israel is prepared to move forward
on so-called ``permanent status'' issues such as the future control
of Jerusalem and the question of Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
   On that subject, Barak signaled confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of the permanent status negotiations and I am
confident that the nature of the Palestinian entity will emerge
quite naturally out of these permanent status negotiations,'' said
Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Palestinian grievances _ specifically a practice by
Israel of detaining, without trial, Palestinians suspected of
anti-Israeli activities _ Barak again sounded a conciliatory note.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working on bringing a peace that will create a
different environment in the Middle East,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak was scheduled to meet with members of Congress on Tuesday
before leaving for Britain, where he was to meet with Prime
Minister Tony Blair.

PRESIDENT DOWNPLAYS DIFFERENCES WITH FIRST LADY OVER JERUSALEM  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton downplayed suggestions Monday
that First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton is at odds with the White
House on the status of Jerusalem in her exploratory campaign for
the U.S. Senate from New York.
</P>
<P>
   The president insisted at a joint news conference with visiting
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak that Mrs. Clinton's support for
Jerusalem as the ``eternal and indivisible capital of Israel'' is
not a repudiation of Clinton administration policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration contends the status of Jerusalem
should be decided in negotiations between Israel and the
Palestinians over so-called final status issues to settle
outstanding disputes over borders, refugees and Jewish settlements
on the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The president said the status of Jerusalem is not a matter of
``public-private dissension'' between the first couple.
</P>
<P>
   Without mentioning Mrs. Clinton by name or laying out a personal
position on the touchy diplomatic issue, the president said that he
has withheld public judgment on the final status of Jerusalem in
order to preserve the U.S. role as an independent broker in
Arab-Israeli peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States hopes to persuade Israel and the
Palestinians ``not to do anything which prejudices final status
issues,'' then the White House must avoid taking stands on issues
that remain on the negotiating table, the president said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The status of Jerusalem is something that the parties
themselves have to work out at the end,'' Clinton said. ``So that
is my position. I don't think there is any inconsistency there at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Clinton's position in the 1992 presidential campaign
resembled the position being taken by Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation sponsored by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.,
adopted by Congress and signed into law by the president in 1995
required the White House to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to
the Israeli-designated capital of Jerusalem by May 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But the measure provided a waiver provision for a president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton invoked the waiver in June to delay action on relocating
the embassy to Jerusalem, saying that delay was essential to
protecting ``critical national security interests'' including
``preserving the prospects for a comprehensive, just and lasting
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The status of Jerusalem is an explosive issue in
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. Palestinians refuse to accept
Israel's unilateral annexation of East Jerusalem in the 1967
Arab-Israeli war. Some see predominantly Arab East Jerusalem
serving as an eventual capital of a Palestinian homeland.
</P>
<P>
   The president, speaking on Monday, said the ``genius'' of the
Moynihan-sponsored legislation was that the measure permits members
of Congress and congressional candidates the opportunity to express
an opinion ``while allowing the United States to continue to be an
honest broker through the waiver authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that while candidates for the House or Senate might
be asked about the issue, ``the president, whoever the president
is, is permitted to honor the obligation of the United States not
to prejudice the final-status issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's Senate exploratory
committee in New York, reiterated the first lady's position, saying
she continues to believe that Jerusalem is Israel's ``indivisible''
capital and that the embassy ought to be relocated ``consistent
with the peace process and Israel's security concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson said that Mrs. Clinton's high-profile role in White
House arrangements during Barak's visit was consistent with her
past efforts on behalf of visiting Israeli officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the customary role for a first lady to play and she is
proud to play it,'' Wolfson said.

</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, exploring a Senate campaign to succeed Moynihan,
echoed the Israeli position on the final status of Jerusalem in a
July 2 letter to Mandell Ganchrow, head of the Orthodox Union, an
organization that represents 750 orthodox Jewish synagogues across
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's exploratory campaign released her letter on July 8
during the first lady's maiden campaign swing through upstate New
York.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, Clinton endorsed relocating the U.S. Embassy to
Jerusalem, adding: ``The timing of such a move must be sensitive to
Israel's interest in achieving a secure peace with its neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   She vowed to ``be an active, committed advocate for a strong and
secure Israel able to live in peace with its neighbors, with the
United States Embassy located in its capital, Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   Jews represent 9.1 percent of New York's population of more than
18 million. Jewish voters made up 12 percent of the electorate in
the Senate race last fall in which then-Rep. Charles Schumer, a
Democrat, the incumbent Republican, Alfonse D'Amato. Schumer
captured 76 percent of the Jewish vote, according to exit polls.

 &HT;    Delta earnings flying high
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The bottom line on Delta Air Lines' management team
now reads like this: two years, two billion-dollar profits.
</P>
<P>
   Delta on Monday reported net income of $1.1 billion for its
fiscal year ended June 30. That's a 10 percent gain from a year
earlier, when Delta had its first $1 billion annual profit.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based airline also said 105.8 million passengers got
on or off its flights in fiscal 1999 _ a record both for Delta and
the industry. However, Delta is still considered the third-biggest
airline behind United and American, which carry fewer people but
log more ``revenue passenger miles'' by virtue of longer routes.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's annual results came on a fourth quarter profit of $364
million, or $2.40 a share, up slightly from $362 million, or $2.26
a share, a year earlier. Delta stock jumped $3.12 1/2 to $62.18 3/4
on the results, which exceeded Wall Street's consensus estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Chief Executive Leo F. Mullin, who arrived in August 1997,
inherited a financial recovery that's leveled off but shown no
signs of slipping. Lower fuel prices and heavy domestic travel
demand have helped sustain the upturn.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter, Delta's revenue rose to $3.96 billion
from $3.76 billion. About half that gain came from non-operational
sources such as more sales of frequent flier mileage for
promotional use by other businesses, said PaineWebber analyst
Samuel Buttrick.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason they beat the street estimates was mileage sales,''
he said, adding, ``It's not conservative accounting.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said Delta performed solidly ``in a quarter that was
comparatively tougher for the industry.'' Continental Airlines on
Monday said quarterly profit fell 18 percent. Other big carriers
report this week.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement with the financial report, Mullin dwelled on an
area where success is more subjective: customer service. ``We have
more to accomplish in this area, but fiscal 1999 marked some
significant progress on a number of important customer service
fronts,'' Mullin said.
</P>
<P>
   He cited Delta's second-place standing in both on-time
performance and lost luggage for the 12 months ended in May,
according to Department of Transportation rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Mullin also said Delta has finished interior refurbishments of
its fleet, completing a project he made a priority shortly after
taking the helm. He said Delta will focus on ``the customer
experience'' in the coming year, through such projects as new gate
check-in and boarding computers.
</P>
<P>
   He said a spike in involuntary bumpings of passengers on
overbooked flights has prompted heavier attention to the problem.
In the first three months of the year, Delta had 8,144 involuntary
bumpings, nearly as many as the other nine major airlines combined.

   BLAGOVESHCHENSK, Russia _ Ten years ago, when Russians gazed
across the Amur River into China, all they could see was a scraggly
forest and an occasional smoke stack. What lay beyond was a
mystery, sealed by a border that was shut tight as a drum.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with ferryboats now making regular trips across the
river, the view is more revealing, and all the more galling for
residents of a city, a region and a country that have spent the
last decade falling behind the strides of their giant neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look over there,'' said Irina Guiman, a 28-year-old candy
factory employee whose last paycheck surfaced six months ago. She
waved her hand at the sparkling new skyline across the river in the
Chinese city of Heihe, bursting with new high-rise buildings, which
she like many others believes were built with the money Chinese
traders take back with them from Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``And look at this,'' she said, turning back toward Lenin
Square, surrounded by grimy Soviet-era structures. ``We're still
the same dirty old village we always were.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when Moscow and Beijing are talking about beefing up
their strategic partnership to counter NATO's show of strength in
Yugoslavia, Russians on this side of the 2,400-mile border with
China have a more cautious, even suspicious view of the
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years of trade, tourism and a regular flow of official
exchanges _ begun after a trip to China in 1989 by the last Soviet
president, Mikhail Gorbachev _ have left many Russians feeling
bitter, disappointed and often exploited by a hectic shuttle trade
in Chinese goods and food that has enriched their Chinese neighbors
and left them as poor _ if not poorer _ than before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We send them our natural resources, and they send us their
disposable clothes,'' said Larisa Buyanova, a deputy editor of
Amurskaya Pravda. ``For China, it is not profitable for us to be
strong. The weaker we are, the more they can get from us.''
</P>
<P>
   Always present in the back of the Russian mind is a
centuries-old fear of Chinese expansion _ if not by force, then by
infiltration. That fear is echoed by Russian foreign policy experts
in Moscow who point to Chinese encroachment in the Far East and
Siberia as one of the nightmares Russia may face if Moscow's
authority over the country continues to weaken.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a question of military confrontation or border
changes, those experts stress, but of gradual erosion of Russian
control and rising Chinese influence, including migration, in a
region very far from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent meeting of leaders from Russia's border regions,
Viktor Ishayev, governor of the Khabarovsk region, described with
alarm how more and more Chinese are moving into the Russian Far
East, often illegally. Citing national statistics, he said
half-a-million Chinese crossed the border into Russia each year,
many never to return.
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger is there,'' said Sergei Torbin, editor of The
Pacific Star, a popular newspaper in Khabarovsk, the second largest
city in the Russian Far East. ``The government has to take stricter
measures, or else one day we will wake up with Chinese all around
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The logic for such scenarios is purely arithmetical. ``We have
10 million people in the whole of the Far East,'' said Sergei
Lopatin, head of the Khabarovsk region's foreign economic relations
department. ``And there are 40 million Chinese in just one of the
provinces across the border. Unemployment in northern China is
high, 30 percent. And their main strategy in Russia is not only in
trade and business; they are constantly and very actively proposing
their labor.''
</P>
<P>
   So far the Chinese presence in Russia's Far East _ a huge swath
of territory carved out by Russian explorers and settlers in the
19th century _ is still muted. But even if the numbers are small,
their influence is growing. Every city has its ``Chinese'' market,
selling fruit, vegetables, cheap goods and clothing brought over by
Russian and Chinese ``suitcase traders'' on the daily ferries.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Blagoveshchensk, residents have learned to appreciate
spicy Chinese cooking at restaurants with names like The Great Wall
and Black Dragon. More than a dozen local dormitories have been
given over to Chinese traders, while busloads of Chinese tourists
fill the rooms at the local Friendship Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Chinese residents and visitors has fallen off
sharply in recent years, as the local and federal authorities
tighten up passport and visa controls. For a border region, the
presence of Chinese does not strike a visitor as overwhelming, and
the frontier is obviously far less porous than the one, say,
between Mexico and Texas. But many residents here speak darkly
about an illegal migration of Chinese that they say is hidden, and
uncounted.
</P>
<P>
   In the vast and empty countryside that stretches north of the
Amur River, hundreds of Chinese farm workers _ earning twice the
wages they can get in their villages in Manchuria _ have been hired
on seasonal contracts to plant watermelons and vegetables, teaching
their Russian hosts how to coax crops out of poor soil using the
age-old Chinese style of back-breaking labor.
</P>
<P>
   And in a neighboring autonomous region, Birobidzhan, local
officials are watching closely to see how a Chinese company
fulfills its promise to turn around a bankrupt Russian logging
enterprise and turn timber into chopsticks for the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
   Yet behind these still-tender shoots of local Chinese business
lurks the uncomfortable feeling that Russia _ its economy weakened
by reform, mismanagement and corruption _ has let itself be taken
advantage of by ``the other shore,'' as Mrs. Buyanova refers to
China.
</P>
<P>
   ``They consider this their city,'' said a photographer who takes
snapshots of Chinese tourists against the backdrop of the Amur
River. ``And that,'' he added, pointing to Heihe's glistening
skyline, ``is our money over there.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The problem, as most Russians here will admit, is that while
Russian shoppers grumble about their dependence on cheap, sometime
shoddy Chinese goods, Russia today has little to offer its Chinese
trading partners except military hardware and natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   Local manufacturers have been unable to compete with Chinese
goods that even now, after last summer's sharp devaluation of the
ruble, cost less than their Russian equivalents. Last year, the
giant region of Khabarovsk _ from the Amur River up the Pacific
coast _ could boast only $600 million in sales to China, of which
all but $60 million was for military exports.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning we sold them Russian military overcoats,''
said Yuri Garushyants, a China expert at Oriental Studies Institute
in Moscow. ``Every Chinese who came to Russia in the early 1990s
went home with one. Now their market is stuffed with coats, and we
have nothing else to sell them.''
</P>
<P>
   Although China still ranks as Russia's third-largest trading
partner, after Germany and the United States, turnover has dropped
sharply in recent years _ from $6.8 billion in 1996 to $5.5 billion
in 1998, according to the Russian Trade Ministry. Russian exports,
valued at $5.5 billion in 1996, had dropped to $3.6 billion by
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Here along the border the decline has been even more dramatic,
after the boom years of the early 1990s when a torrent of Russian
raw materials and heavy equipment streamed across the border in
exchange for crates of fruit, vegetables, rice and other
commodities.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1991, as a result of reforms, we were left with empty
shelves,'' Lopatin said. ``In these conditions, China did its
business. They sent us their cheap goods, their noodles and their
vegetables, and everyone bought them up.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of this early trade was barter, which allowed entrepreneurs
on both sides to avoid taxes and customs duties, and which skewed
statistics. In China, where the Communist government keeps stricter
control over foreign trade, much of the profit was plowed back into
the economy _ hence the glistening Heihe skyline. In Russia
profits, including those earned by local middlemen, were rarely if
ever translated into investments.
</P>
<P>
   The boom years were already over by the mid-1990s when Russia
began to raise fees on rail transport, utilities and other costs,
which made Russian-produced tractors, excavators and other heavy
equipment less economically attractive to the Chinese. Here in the
Amur region, for instance, trade with China peaked in 1993 at $416
million. By 1998, it was down to $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Cross-border barter has also been curtailed, as Russia tries to
bring its foreign trade in compliance with requirements set by the
World Trade Organization. According to the Trade Ministry, if in
the early 1990s, half of Russian-Chinese trade was conducted in
barter, now _ officially _ the proportion is only 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Official statistics, however, consistently underestimate the
volume of shuttle traffic and, according to many residents, the
real numbers of Chinese who have taken up residence in Russia,
sometimes illegally. By the mid 1990s, the numbers of Chinese
traders, arriving here on tourist visas, became so great that
Russia adopted tighter requirements, obligating tourist agencies to
hold onto the Chinese clients' passports until their departure.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of the ruble last summer put a major dent in the
``suitcase trade.'' At the Chinese market in Khabarovsk, where
1,500 vendors are licensed to trade in tightly packed stalls,
salespeople speaking pidgin Russian complain loudly that business
these days is bad, very bad.
</P>
<P>
   Among the trade that goes unreported are the goods brought into
Russia by Russians, who are hired by Chinese suppliers to make the
trip from Blagoveshchensk to an island in the middle of the Amur,
where the Chinese have built a new trading center.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Buyanova, for instance, has a neighbor, an underemployed
university professor, who gets paid 200 rubles for each of the nine
trips she makes to China each month, bringing back only as much as
she can arguably use for her personal use.
</P>
<P>
   But according to Mrs. Buyanova, that requirement is not strictly
enforced by Russian customs agents. ``Our customs officials are
good at looking the other way,'' she said, ``because they know that
this is how people are forced to make a living.''

SEEMS LIKE OLD TIMES: RICHARD GERE, JULIA ROBERTS AND ROMANCE MAKES

 (Includes a color slide of Richard Gere in a scene from ``Runaway
Bride.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Richard Gere is perceived as Mr. Serious.
 &HT;    ``I am serious,'' he says. ``I'm seriously goofy.''
 &HT;    A soft smile crosses the star's handsome face.
 &HT;    ``Like most people, I'm a lot of different things,'' he says as
he settles into a chair in a suite room at the Four Season Hotel in
Los Angeles. ``The people who know me well know me more as goofy.
They're surprised by the serious side.''
 &HT;    For real?
 &HT;    ``For real,'' Gere says. ``For real.''
 &HT;    Moviegoers used to Gere's serious side of late in such films as
``The Jackal'' (1997) and ``Red Corner'' (1997) are in for a
surprise with ``Runaway Bride,'' a romantic-comedy that reunites
him with the ``Pretty Woman'' tandem of co-star Julia Roberts and
director Garry Marshall.
 &HT;    Opening nationwide on July 30, the film casts Roberts as the
title character, a small-town woman with a knack for fleeing her
weddings, and Gere as a divorced, New York-based newspaper
columnist who decides to cover her story.
 &HT;    Re-teaming with Roberts took forever, Gere insists, for one
simple reason: the lack of a decent script.
 &HT;    ``You'd think that based on how successful `Pretty Woman' was
that there would be teams of people all over the world, cottage
industries of people, writing scripts for us,'' he says, laughing
easily. ``And there may well have been, but none of the scripts
were any good.''
 &HT;    The ``Runaway Bride'' script had been kicking around for nearly
a decade. Both Gere and Roberts received it at various points since
``Pretty Woman,'' but never paid it much attention.
 &HT;    Gere was busy doing serious films and Roberts, who emerged from
``Pretty Woman'' a megastar, grew increasingly and famously choosy.
Finally, the screenplay crossed Gere's desk again and he realized
that, whether or not he signed on, it would be perfect for Roberts.
 &HT;    ``I could see her in it much more clearly than I could see
myself,'' says Gere, who turns 50 on Aug. 31. ``I called her and
said just that. Also, it's a real '40s romantic-comedy, and the
characters are combative and smart.
 &HT;    ``She read it and responded to it. We both responded to it. We
met in my office and like good professionals we had our list of
directors out.
 &HT;    ``We started laughing and said, `Garry.' So we called him right
there from my office and he said, `Fabulous. Send it over.'
 &HT;    ``Two days later we were making the movie.''
 &HT;    ``Pretty Woman'' and ``Runaway Bride'' co-star Hector Elizondo
recalls that Gere and Roberts shared something of a mentor-mentee
relationship the first time around, but feels that on ``Runaway
Bride'' Roberts was very much an equal. Gere listens intently and
politely, but he's not buying it.
 &HT;    ``I don't know if that was ever the case, to tell you the
truth,'' he says. ``You saw `Pretty Woman.' She was full-blown. She
knew what to do.
 &HT;    ``Julia is 10 years older now and has done a lot more, but she
was always terrific. She's just more terrific now.
 &HT;    ``Julia and I know how to do this kind of thing. We've been
friends for a long time. When we did the first readthrough it was
so clear and we were smirking at each other.
 &HT;    ``We were on solid ground right from the beginning, and Garry
makes everything so easy and fun.''
 &HT;    Though the trio could join forces again in the future, anyone
holding out hope for a ``Pretty Woman'' sequel should pretty much
pack it in.
 &HT;    ``I don't think any of us had the instinct to do it, with
everything that would entail,'' Gere says. ``The repetition wasn't
interesting to us.
 &HT;    ``Lightning struck with `Pretty Woman.' You can't make
lightning. So I think to come together now (for ``Runaway Bride''),
without the overheated expectations that would have been there a
year or two after `Pretty Woman,' probably made it easier on all of
us.''
 &HT;    Gere comes across splendidly in ``Runaway Bride.'' He's winning
and loose and relaxed, and after so many somber performances in so
many somber films, it's a decidedly welcome change of pace.
 &HT;    Even Gere can't deny that, though the Mr. Serious within gives
it a shot.
 &HT;    ``I know that if you're not being arrested by the Chinese,
thrown into a prison and tortured, you can be very relaxed playing
a '40s character in a romantic-comedy directed by Garry Marshall,''
he says. ``The demands are totally different. Doing `Red Corner'
does not lend itself to being wacky.
 &HT;    ``Look, if there were more scripts like (``Runaway Bride'') I'd
do them, though I'm not naturally drawn to comedies.
 &HT;    ``My own instinct is to do something more dramatic and more
emotionally powerful,'' he concludes. ``I enjoy doing these movies,
though, and I like seeing these kinds of movies. There's still the
pleasure of just being transported by entertainment at the
movies.''
 &HT;    Of course, it's seemingly never been just about entertainment
with Gere. Over the years, he has established himself as a vocal
proponent of several human-rights causes, chief among them the
plight of Tibetans under Chinese rule.
 &HT;    A longtime Zen Buddhist, Gere is the founding chairman of Tibet
House in New York, and is frequently seen with the Dalai Lama.
 &HT;    ``I had no interest in being public about that part of my life
for a long time,'' Gere says. ``I was quite protective about it. It
was really at the request of my teachers, specifically the Dalai
Lama, that I did what I could as a Westerner to help.
 &HT;    ``I had access to the media,'' he adds, ``and it was my
responsibility to use it in an effective and generous way. And now
people _ journalists even _ seem genuinely interested, and that
makes me excited to talk about it.''
 &HT;    Talking about it so much, Gere suggests, has debunked the
greatest misconception about Buddhism _ that it's some kind of
spaced-out cult.
 &HT;    ``The political side is very understandable,'' he says
passionately, eyes focused. ``What's hard is to put these ideas
together, to speak of human-rights abuses _ genocide _ and
transcendent wisdom, which is the myth side of Tibet and Buddhism.
 &HT;    ``It's not just spacing out. It's a constant working with your
mind, in a very intense way.''
 &HT;    Beyond his spiritual pursuits, Gere is busy on other fronts
personal and professional. He and longtime girlfriend Carey Lowell
recently announced that they're expecting a child in the new year.
 &HT;    And on the acting front, Gere will shoot two films back-to-back.
First, there's ``Autumn in New York,'' a relationship drama with
Winona Ryder, to be followed by Robert Altman's ``Dr. T and His
Women,'' with Gere playing a gynecologist opposite Liv Tyler,
Claire Danes and other actresses to be cast.
 &HT;    ``I've had an interesting career, but I've never had the luxury
of having figured it out,'' Gere says, laughing. ```OK, I'll do
this one and then this one.' It's been very haphazard.
 &HT;    ``I'm sure if I had vision from the top of the mountain I'd see
how they all connect. But I just do it one step at a time.''

`TRICK' OF THE TRADE: TORI SPELLING, INDIE FILM QUEEN?

 (Includes a color slide of Tori Spelling in a scene from
``Trick.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    ``Oh my God, that's Tori Spelling!'' sniffed a nasty blonde in a
Gucci suit one morning at a chic Beverly Hills boutique.
 &HT;    ``No, she only wishes,'' her companion scoffed. ``She's just
trying to look like Tori Spelling. That's not her _ that girl is
pathetic!''
 &HT;    Actually, for the record, that was indeed the much-mocked star
of television's ``Beverly Hills 90210.'' And not so long ago, she
recalls, those kind of comments got to her.
 &HT;    ``There was a time when I felt like everyone was out to rip
me,'' television's favorite former virgin admits. ``I felt like I
couldn't win.''
 &HT;    To judge by appearances, those days are gone. Sitting in her
dressing room and sipping a diet cola, the slight 26-year-old with
the lustrous, brown-red hair is on something of a roll, with
glowing reviews for her new film ``Trick'' _ an independent film
following her indie turn in ``The House of Yes'' (1997) and her
witty self-parody in ``Scream 2'' (1998).
 &HT;    Which doesn't make her any happier about such things as the ``I
Hate Tori Spelling'' Website, where anonymous denizens of the
Internet trash her looks, her acting and the plastic surgery she
swears she's never had.
 &HT;    ``It's really hurt my feelings,'' the actress says. ``I've read
this stuff and cried.''
 &HT;    Of course, Spelling is an easy target. Not only does she have a
starring role on television's campiest soap opera, but she's the
daughter of uberproducer Aaron Spelling, whose legion of hits
includes ... yes, of course, ``Beverly Hills 90210.''
 &HT;    Which perhaps explains why she's showing a bent for independent
films, which is about as far as an actress can get from the
lowest-common-denominator fare of Aaron Spelling and his ilk.
Critics have raved about her performance in the low-budget
``Trick'' as a hopelessly talentless wannabe actress in a gay
coming-of-age story that Entertainment Weekly recently called ``the
single bravest thing Spelling has ever done.''
 &HT;    Which the actress says is news to her, since she doesn't read
reviews.
 &HT;    ``You know what? I honestly don't listen to what people think
anymore,'' Spelling says. ``I just deal with it, the good and the
bad. The important thing is that I'm proud of my work. It gets
better and better all the time.
 &HT;    ``I want to force people to take a second look at me. Maybe
they'll finally say, `Oh, she can act.'''
 &HT;    Or even sing and dance, as she does in ``Trick.''
 &HT;    ``The worst part of my dance number is that I lied,'' Spelling
says gleefully. ``When I went in for the audition, they asked if I
could sing and dance. And I was like, `Of course I can sing and
dance.'
 &HT;    ``The truth is that I'm actually afraid of singing in public.''
 &HT;    Spelling has been squeezing her publicity chores for ``Trick''
around her 14-hours-a-day shooting schedule for the 10th and final
season of ``Beverly Hills 90210'' _ her last dance as the
terminally happy Donna, until two seasons ago television's last
virgin.
 &HT;    ``I was really happy that Donna finally lost her virginity,''
the actress says. ``Watching the episode, I was even tearing up.
 &HT;    ``It's sad that she's not a virgin anymore,'' she explains.
``I've always thought Donna was the younger side of me. And once
her virginity was gone I thought, `You know what? I really am all
grown up.'''
 &HT;    Grown up enough to have some out-of-character thoughts about
Donna, too.
 &HT;    ``I wanted Donna to turn into an evil tramp on the show,'' she
jokes. ``I wanted her to have a nightmare sequence where we all
just totally changed personalities. Donna could have looked at
Dylan (Luke Perry) and said, `Look, all these years I've had the
hots for you. Let's just go for it!'''
 &HT;    As for the show's ending, Spelling has already put in her vote
for the final plot twists.
 &HT;    ``I know the fans would like to see Donna end up with David,''
she says. ``He was her first boyfriend on the show, and they had a
beautiful love story. I'd like to see the show end on a high
point.''
 &HT;    The final episode will be an ending of sorts for a woman who
decided as early as 5 that she wanted to be a television star, and
told her famous daddy so.
 &HT;    ``My Dad said, `Oh, sure, honey. Last week you wanted to be an
ice skater,''' she recalls. ``Then he said, `You really want to do
this? OK, we'll give you a couple of lines in `Vegas.' How's that?'
I said, `It will do.'''
 &HT;    Her next effort was less successful, however.
 &HT;    ``I always wanted to be on `Charlie's Angels,''' Spelling says.
``I wanted to be the little sister of one of the angels. I always
pitched that one to my dad. But I never made it _ he said, `No,
you're not going on shows that have skimpy clothing!'''
 &HT;    She did manage to talk her way aboard ``The Love Boat'' twice,
before being cast in ``Beverly Hills 90210'' at 17.
 &HT;    Despite her youth, Spelling managed to keep her bearings, unlike
such co-stars as wild child Shannen Doherty.
 &HT;    ``The main reason I stayed so stable through the early, crazy
days of the series is because I refused to let fame ruin my life,''
she says. ``If my friends wanted to go to Limited Express, I went
with them. I didn't want to be different. They kept me grounded.''
 &HT;    Still, she admits that she hates the criticism of her looks.
 &HT;    ``I've always been really insecure about myself in that way,''
the actress says. ``Some of the things you've read are so mean. No,
I didn't have a boob job _ I just lost my baby fat. I tried a
Miracle Bra. Is that a crime?''
 &HT;    She adds that her thinness comes naturally.
 &HT;    ``I can eat anything I want and it doesn't matter,'' she says.
``People always think that's so uncommon, but I have a lot of
friends who are just like me _ we can eat pizza and hot fudge
sundaes, we don't gain an ounce.
 &HT;    ``I just hope that teens out there don't try to look as thin as
me if that's not natural to their bodies,'' she adds.
 &HT;    Looking ahead, Spelling would love to find a zany sitcom for
herself.
 &HT;    ``I'd like to do something wacky like `I Love Lucy,''' she says.
``I know there are a lot of shows about young married couples, but
I think I could bring something fun and new to that scenario.''
 &HT;    In the meantime, however, she lives a quiet life, single but
hardly in the same league as Donna, who these days on ``90210'' is
trying to fend off the advances of two suitors.
 &HT;    ``At home it's just me and my dog,'' she says with a sigh. ``I
guess I have to live vicariously through my character when it comes
to romance. I can't seem to find anyone.''
 &HT;    Most of her nights are spent watching old movies and television
reruns into the wee hours, she adds. She can't sleep without the
television being on all night long.
 &HT;    ``The worst is if I flip by an old episode of `90210,'''
Spelling says. ``Those shows are like a yearbook of past bad hair
styles. I always wince and grab the remote as quickly as
possible.''

 THE WORKING WORLD OF ANI DiFRANCO  
 (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to StarBeat, a weekly
package of five intriguing features with color art.) 
 (Includes a color slide of singer/songwriter Ani DiFranco
performing onstage.) 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Ani DiFranco may not be a latter-day version of Mother Jones,
Lucy Parsons or the other labor heroines of the past. But ``Fellow
Workers,'' the Buffalo-based singer/songwriter's latest album, is
the most significant labor commentary from any contemporary pop
performer this side of Billy Bragg.
 &HT;    It's also her second collaboration with the activist and folk
legend Bruce ``Utah'' Phillips, who provides the album's vocals,
offering plainspoken dissertations about incidents and figures in
the history of labor and singing standards such as ``Joe Hill,''
``Bread and Roses'' and ``Dump the Bosses.''
 &HT;    DiFranco and her band _ plus guests such as Soul Asylum's Dave
Pirner, who plays trumpet on one number _ dress up the classic
songs with sympathetic soundscapes, mostly improvised, that range
from haunting, dreamy weaves to rootsy shuffles and uptempo
thrashing behind Phillips' scratchy but impassioned vocals.
 &HT;    ``Fellow Workers'' is a logical extension of ``The Past Didn't
Go Anywhere'' (1996), the innovative album for which she created
music for recordings Phillips made separately. ``Fellow Workers''
is a more organic project _ the duo joined forces for two
performances before invitation-only audiences at Kingsway Studios
in New Orleans, after which DiFranco waded through the tapes to
shape the eventual album.
 &HT;    ``I had lots of tape and lots of material, and I sort of saw in
there the shape of an album about labor history and solidarity and
things like that,'' says the 28-year-old DiFranco, herself a
``card-carrying musician's-union member since puberty'' who as a
matter of principle has canceled performances rather than cross
picket lines.
 &HT;    Beyond the labor standards, the album really shines when
Phillips, the son of two labor organizers, waxes wise and
historical about Mother Jones in ``The Most Dangerous Woman'' and
Lucy Parsons in ``Shoot or Stab Them,'' about the 1912
Massachusetts textile strike in ``Lawrence'' and, in several songs,
about the Industrial Workers of the World, better known as the
``Wobblies.''
 &HT;    ``These old songs, these old stories _ why tell them? What do
they mean?'' the 64-year-old Phillips asks _ rhetorically, of
course _ in one piece that declares ``the long memory is the most
radical idea in America.''
 &HT;    ``When I went to high school,'' he says, ``I got the history of
the people who owned the wealth of the country, but none of the
history of the people who created it. And that was deliberate,
wasn't it?
 &HT;    ``If I wanted a true history of where I came from, the working
class, I had to go to my elders ... They gave me a history that is
more profound and more beautiful and more powerful and more
passionate _ and, ultimately, more useful _ than the best damn
history book I've ever read.''
 &HT;    Not typical pop fare, to be sure, but DiFranco has never been
much concerned with mainstream success. She releases her albums
through her own label, Righteous Babe Records, and reaches an
audience primarily made up of college and high-school students and
20-somethings. And, as far as she's concerned, that young audience
may not be able to relate to these songs, but that's all the more
reason for her to record them and hopefully open some eyes.
 &HT;    ``I think a lot of young people don't really have a
consciousness about such a thing,'' DiFranco says. ``I think these
days young people are sort of born into this disillusionment that
labor unions are inherently corrupt and in the way ... But I think
that there's a lot of really important history that young people
don't necessarily know about, these days.
 &HT;    ``There're so many un-unionized large corporations that
everybody seems to work for right now,'' she says, ``and there's
not really a consciousness of `We need a union.' I think we need to
get back to that awareness ... Now you don't have a Rockefeller or
some big-bellied line boss exploiting you, you have some
multinational, nameless corporation _ but I think the dynamic
therein is much the same, and we need to learn from our history.''
 &HT;    There are few better teachers than the Cleveland-born Phillips,
a former railrider, printer, dishwasher and stock clerk whose
bitter experiences during the Korean War turned him to activism. He
helped found the Poor People's Party in Utah, and made an
unsuccessful 1968 run for the United States Senate on the Peace and
Freedom ticket.
 &HT;    After losing his job with the Utah State Archives following that
campaign, Phillips took to entertaining, traveling the country in a
Volkswagen minibus and spinning tales and songs for whoever would
have him. He continues to host a syndicated weekly radio show,
``Loafer's Glory: Hobo Jungle of the Mind.''
 &HT;    But Phillips, who has a heart condition that no longer allows
him to travel extensively, is reaching his widest audience yet
through DiFranco, who says she's happy to do her part to bring the
spotlight to Phillips and his message.
 &HT;    ``I look at the albums I've done for Utah more as a vehicle for
him, really,'' DiFranco says. ``It's really a calculated effort on
my part to try and get Utah to my audience.
 &HT;    ``Utah has been mostly known in acoustic- and folk-music circles
and progressive political circles,'' she says. ``In terms of just
the kids today, there weren't a lot of them that knew his name. So
that's changing a little bit, which is a good feeling.''
 &HT;    With ``Fellow Workers'' in the can, however, DiFranco has turned
her attention to her own work. She and her band have a long summer
tour ahead _ which, she hints, may include some surprise guest
appearances at Lilith Fair dates.
 &HT;    Then she plans to start work on her own next album, though she
won't hazard a guess as to what creative path she'll follow.
 &HT;    ``I try not to think too much before I start playing music about
how I should play music,'' she says. ``I just sort of do it.''

a scene from ``Jesse.'') 
 By CATHERINE DAWSON, BRIAN HARTIGAN and ANGELA BARKER  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since its earliest days, television has specialized in sexy
stars who brought color even to the age of black and white.
</P>
<P>
   But who are today's sexiest stars? Three TV Guide Canada staff
writers team up for an admittedly subjective _ but so what? _ look
at some men and women who can make even the hottest summer day a
little hotter yet. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; GILLIAN ANDERSON &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As David Duchovny's opposite number on ``The X-Files,'' Gillian
Anderson's smoldering Scully is the perfect foil for Duchovny's
excitable Mulder.
</P>
<P>
   With her blazing red hair and a look that vaguely suggests a
1940s pinup girl, Anderson is a refreshing break from television's
endless stream of blonde waifs.
</P>
<P>
   As much as we love ``The X-Files,'' we can't wait for Gillian to
move on to different things _ and to show us more. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; JENNIFER ANISTON &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forget the haircut or the craze that it caused. Jennifer Aniston
could have a crew cut and she'd still make us drool.
</P>
<P>
   When ``Friends'' was first launched, her character, Rachel
Green, started out as a ditzy, selfish rich girl. But during the
course of five seasons, she's blossomed into a strong, confident,
go-get-'em woman who seems to know exactly what she wants.
</P>
<P>
   For that _ and, OK, for the great hair, too _ Aniston gets our
vote for the sexiest girlFriend. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; CHRISTINA APPLEGATE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, Christina Applegate wouldn't have had a chance
at making this list. Why not? Because, beyond her obvious physical
appeal, there was nothing sexy about her ``Married ... with
Children'' character, dumb-blonde-and-slutty Kelly Bundy.
</P>
<P>
   Now that she's on ``Jesse'' and playing a smart single mom,
Applegate exudes oodles of grace and charm. She's the kind of woman
every mother wants her son to find _ a modern-day Valerie
Bertinelli, cute as a button with that girl-next-door appeal. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; BRUNO CAMPOS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are only two words to describe Latin sensation Bruno
Campos: Hubba hubba!
</P>
<P>
   The exotic star of ``Jesse,'' who was born in Brazil but grew up
in Toronto, Bahrain and Houston as the son of an international
banker, adds sizzle to any scene.
</P>
<P>
   Only 24 now, Campos undoubtedly played a part in securing a Best
Foreign Film Oscar nomination for his 1996 breakout film, ``O
Quatrilho.'' &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; KIM DELANEY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's Kim Delaney's subtleness that caught our eye.
</P>
<P>
   As Det. Diane Russell on ``NYPD Blue,'' this is a woman who
finds a way to look sexy in slacks every single week _ not to
mention in a bit less during those love scenes with Jimmy Smits
back when. In fact, her good looks and NYPD no-nonsense image
earned her a modeling contract with Revlon.
</P>
<P>
   In her mid-to-late 30s, Delaney represents what the British call
``the thinking man's crumpet,'' a woman both sexy and smart. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; DAVID DUCHOVNY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The smoldering ``X-Files'' star, with his deadpan sense of
humor, is a thinking woman's Pop-Tart, then.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Princeton and Yale, David Duchovny was actually
working on his doctorate when he started a career in acting. We're
sure it wasn't his smarts alone, however, that snagged him dates
with the likes of Winona Ryder and Sheryl Lee before he married Tea
Leoni.
</P>
<P>
   Could it have been that scholarship-level basketball player's
body? &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; HEATHER LOCKLEAR &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Isn't it obvious? Heather Locklear embodies the sexy,
California-girl archetype.
</P>
<P>
   Blond, athletically toned, perky and wearing a dress size that
most teenagers can't fit into, Locklear has been turning viewers'
heads since she appeared on ``CHiPS'' in 1977. In the 1980s she
began stopping traffic in her ``T.J. Hooker'' uniform and stealing
scenes as siren Sammy Jo in ``Dynasty.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was during her six years on ``Melrose Place'' that
Locklear's barely-there business suits and ballsy business sense
established her screen reputation.
</P>
<P>
   We can't wait to see her on ``Spin City'' this fall. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; ERIC McCORMACK &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eric McCormack may have been impressing stage audiences for
years, but it wasn't until he won the role of the
sometimes-good-and-sometimes-bad Col. Francis Clay Mosby on
``Lonesome Dove: The Series'' that a wider audience fell for his
dashing good looks.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as gay attorney Will Truman on ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' McCormack
has not only found a 20th-century role, but his appeal has crossed
the gender barrier, too. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; DYLAN McDERMOTT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As Bobby Donnell on ``The Practice,'' Dylan McDermott oozes both
confidence and brooding intensity.
</P>
<P>
   While it doesn't hurt that he's got a sleek physique and classic
good looks, what makes McDermott sexiest is his quiet demeanor, as
seen on talk shows and in interviews. Many women say that what
makes a man most desirable is when he's hot but he doesn't seem to
know it.
</P>
<P>
   Dylan, trust us, there's no reason for modesty. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; GLORIA REUBEN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If keeping a positive attitude in the face of constant adversity
makes one sexy, count Canadian-born Gloria Reuben as the sexiest
soul on television.
</P>
<P>
   Her ``ER'' character, Jeanie Boulet, has faced unemployment, the
death of a young friend and, of course, HIV. If it wasn't for her
beautiful smile, viewers might think she'd be ready to pack it in.
</P>
<P>
   Reuben's quiet elegance brings a much-needed refinement to the
otherwise dank halls of County General. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; SCOTT WOLF &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The delightfully boyish good looks that landed him guest spots
on teenybopper shows such as ``Saved By the Bell'' and ``Blossom''
helped turn Scott Wolf into a star as the sensitive, thoughtful
brother in ``Party of Five.''
</P>
<P>
   At only 5-foot-8, with a penchant for casual, sporty attire,
``Scooter's'' cute quotient is off the scale. He's recently brought
it to Broadway, where he's taken over for Christian Slater in the
lead role in the hit play, ``Side Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 31, the adorable Wolf continues to convincingly play
characters at least 10 years his junior. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; NOAH WYLE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This man can melt hearts when he smiles. As ``ER's'' Dr. John
Carter, Noah Wyle is just the kind of guy a girl wants pressing a
stethoscope to her chest.
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old Wyle is funny and upper-class cute _ note the
patrician nose _ and wins over audiences with Carter's earnest
belief in doing the right thing. Viewers have watched him grow up
through the past five seasons on ``ER,'' from boyish nerd to
confident medic.
</P>
<P>
   He's someone fans can realistically dream about dating _ proving
that George Clooney's Dr. Ross wasn't ``ER's'' only hunk in a white
lab coat. &QL;

 (Includes a color slide of Richard Gere in a scene from ``Runaway
Bride.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Richard Gere is perceived as Mr. Serious.
 &HT;    ``I am serious,'' he says. ``I'm seriously goofy.''
 &HT;    A soft smile crosses the star's handsome face.
 &HT;    ``Like most people, I'm a lot of different things,'' he says as
he settles into a chair in a suite room at the Four Season Hotel in
Los Angeles. ``The people who know me well know me more as goofy.
They're surprised by the serious side.''
 &HT;    For real?
 &HT;    ``For real,'' Gere says. ``For real.''
 &HT;    Moviegoers used to Gere's serious side of late in such films as
``The Jackal'' (1997) and ``Red Corner'' (1997) are in for a
surprise with ``Runaway Bride,'' a romantic-comedy that reunites
him with the ``Pretty Woman'' tandem of co-star Julia Roberts and
director Garry Marshall.
 &HT;    Opening nationwide on July 30, the film casts Roberts as the
title character, a small-town woman with a knack for fleeing her
weddings, and Gere as a divorced, New York-based newspaper
columnist who decides to cover her story.
 &HT;    Re-teaming with Roberts took forever, Gere insists, for one
simple reason: the lack of a decent script.
 &HT;    ``You'd think that based on how successful `Pretty Woman' was
that there would be teams of people all over the world, cottage
industries of people, writing scripts for us,'' he says, laughing
easily. ``And there may well have been, but none of the scripts
were any good.''
 &HT;    The ``Runaway Bride'' script had been kicking around for nearly
a decade. Both Gere and Roberts received it at various points since
``Pretty Woman,'' but never paid it much attention.
 &HT;    Gere was busy doing serious films and Roberts, who emerged from
``Pretty Woman'' a megastar, grew increasingly and famously choosy.
Finally, the screenplay crossed Gere's desk again and he realized
that, whether or not he signed on, it would be perfect for Roberts.
 &HT;    ``I could see her in it much more clearly than I could see
myself,'' says Gere, who turns 50 on Aug. 31. ``I called her and
said just that. Also, it's a real '40s romantic-comedy, and the
characters are combative and smart.
 &HT;    ``She read it and responded to it. We both responded to it. We
met in my office and like good professionals we had our list of
directors out.
 &HT;    ``We started laughing and said, `Garry.' So we called him right
there from my office and he said, `Fabulous. Send it over.'
 &HT;    ``Two days later we were making the movie.''
 &HT;    ``Pretty Woman'' and ``Runaway Bride'' co-star Hector Elizondo
recalls that Gere and Roberts shared something of a mentor-mentee
relationship the first time around, but feels that on ``Runaway
Bride'' Roberts was very much an equal. Gere listens intently and
politely, but he's not buying it.
 &HT;    ``I don't know if that was ever the case, to tell you the
truth,'' he says. ``You saw `Pretty Woman.' She was full-blown. She
knew what to do.
 &HT;    ``Julia is 10 years older now and has done a lot more, but she
was always terrific. She's just more terrific now.
 &HT;    ``Julia and I know how to do this kind of thing. We've been
friends for a long time. When we did the first readthrough it was
so clear and we were smirking at each other.
 &HT;    ``We were on solid ground right from the beginning, and Garry
makes everything so easy and fun.''
 &HT;    Though the trio could join forces again in the future, anyone
holding out hope for a ``Pretty Woman'' sequel should pretty much
pack it in.
 &HT;    ``I don't think any of us had the instinct to do it, with
everything that would entail,'' Gere says. ``The repetition wasn't
interesting to us.
 &HT;    ``Lightning struck with `Pretty Woman.' You can't make
lightning. So I think to come together now (for ``Runaway Bride''),
without the overheated expectations that would have been there a
year or two after `Pretty Woman,' probably made it easier on all of
us.''
 &HT;    Gere comes across splendidly in ``Runaway Bride.'' He's winning
and loose and relaxed, and after so many somber performances in so
many somber films, it's a decidedly welcome change of pace.
 &HT;    Even Gere can't deny that, though the Mr. Serious within gives
it a shot.
 &HT;    ``I know that if you're not being arrested by the Chinese,
thrown into a prison and tortured, you can be very relaxed playing
a '40s character in a romantic-comedy directed by Garry Marshall,''
he says. ``The demands are totally different. Doing `Red Corner'
does not lend itself to being wacky.
 &HT;    ``Look, if there were more scripts like (``Runaway Bride'') I'd
do them, though I'm not naturally drawn to comedies.
 &HT;    ``My own instinct is to do something more dramatic and more
emotionally powerful,'' he concludes. ``I enjoy doing these movies,
though, and I like seeing these kinds of movies. There's still the
pleasure of just being transported by entertainment at the
movies.''
 &HT;    Of course, it's seemingly never been just about entertainment
with Gere. Over the years, he has established himself as a vocal
proponent of several human-rights causes, chief among them the
plight of Tibetans under Chinese rule.
 &HT;    A longtime Zen Buddhist, Gere is the founding chairman of Tibet
House in New York, and is frequently seen with the Dalai Lama.
 &HT;    ``I had no interest in being public about that part of my life
for a long time,'' Gere says. ``I was quite protective about it. It
was really at the request of my teachers, specifically the Dalai
Lama, that I did what I could as a Westerner to help.
 &HT;    ``I had access to the media,'' he adds, ``and it was my
responsibility to use it in an effective and generous way. And now
people _ journalists even _ seem genuinely interested, and that
makes me excited to talk about it.''
 &HT;    Talking about it so much, Gere suggests, has debunked the
greatest misconception about Buddhism _ that it's some kind of
spaced-out cult.
 &HT;    ``The political side is very understandable,'' he says
passionately, eyes focused. ``What's hard is to put these ideas
together, to speak of human-rights abuses _ genocide _ and
transcendent wisdom, which is the myth side of Tibet and Buddhism.
 &HT;    ``It's not just spacing out. It's a constant working with your
mind, in a very intense way.''
 &HT;    Beyond his spiritual pursuits, Gere is busy on other fronts
personal and professional. He and longtime girlfriend Carey Lowell
recently announced that they're expecting a child in the new year.
 &HT;    And on the acting front, Gere will shoot two films back-to-back.
First, there's ``Autumn in New York,'' a relationship drama with
Winona Ryder, to be followed by Robert Altman's ``Dr. T and His
Women,'' with Gere playing a gynecologist opposite Liv Tyler,
Claire Danes and other actresses to be cast.
 &HT;    ``I've had an interesting career, but I've never had the luxury
of having figured it out,'' Gere says, laughing. ```OK, I'll do
this one and then this one.' It's been very haphazard.
 &HT;    ``I'm sure if I had vision from the top of the mountain I'd see
how they all connect. But I just do it one step at a time.''

`TRICK' OF THE TRADE: TORI SPELLING, INDIE FILM QUEEN?

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of Tori Spelling in a scene from
``Trick.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    ``Oh my God, that's Tori Spelling!'' sniffed a nasty blonde in a
Gucci suit one morning at a chic Beverly Hills boutique.
 &HT;    ``No, she only wishes,'' her companion scoffed. ``She's just
trying to look like Tori Spelling. That's not her _ that girl is
pathetic!''
 &HT;    Actually, for the record, that was indeed the much-mocked star
of television's ``Beverly Hills 90210.'' And not so long ago, she
recalls, those kind of comments got to her.
 &HT;    ``There was a time when I felt like everyone was out to rip
me,'' television's favorite former virgin admits. ``I felt like I
couldn't win.''
 &HT;    To judge by appearances, those days are gone. Sitting in her
dressing room and sipping a diet cola, the slight 26-year-old with
the lustrous, brown-red hair is on something of a roll, with
glowing reviews for her new film ``Trick'' _ an independent film
following her indie turn in ``The House of Yes'' (1997) and her
witty self-parody in ``Scream 2'' (1998).
 &HT;    Which doesn't make her any happier about such things as the ``I
Hate Tori Spelling'' Website, where anonymous denizens of the
Internet trash her looks, her acting and the plastic surgery she
swears she's never had.
 &HT;    ``It's really hurt my feelings,'' the actress says. ``I've read
this stuff and cried.''
 &HT;    Of course, Spelling is an easy target. Not only does she have a
starring role on television's campiest soap opera, but she's the
daughter of uberproducer Aaron Spelling, whose legion of hits
includes ... yes, of course, ``Beverly Hills 90210.''
 &HT;    Which perhaps explains why she's showing a bent for independent
films, which is about as far as an actress can get from the
lowest-common-denominator fare of Aaron Spelling and his ilk.
Critics have raved about her performance in the low-budget
``Trick'' as a hopelessly talentless wannabe actress in a gay
coming-of-age story that Entertainment Weekly recently called ``the
single bravest thing Spelling has ever done.''
 &HT;    Which the actress says is news to her, since she doesn't read
reviews.
 &HT;    ``You know what? I honestly don't listen to what people think
anymore,'' Spelling says. ``I just deal with it, the good and the
bad. The important thing is that I'm proud of my work. It gets
better and better all the time.
 &HT;    ``I want to force people to take a second look at me. Maybe
they'll finally say, `Oh, she can act.'''
 &HT;    Or even sing and dance, as she does in ``Trick.''
 &HT;    ``The worst part of my dance number is that I lied,'' Spelling
says gleefully. ``When I went in for the audition, they asked if I
could sing and dance. And I was like, `Of course I can sing and
dance.'
 &HT;    ``The truth is that I'm actually afraid of singing in public.''
 &HT;    Spelling has been squeezing her publicity chores for ``Trick''
around her 14-hours-a-day shooting schedule for the 10th and final
season of ``Beverly Hills 90210'' _ her last dance as the
terminally happy Donna, until two seasons ago television's last
virgin.
 &HT;    ``I was really happy that Donna finally lost her virginity,''
the actress says. ``Watching the episode, I was even tearing up.
 &HT;    ``It's sad that she's not a virgin anymore,'' she explains.
``I've always thought Donna was the younger side of me. And once
her virginity was gone I thought, `You know what? I really am all
grown up.'''
 &HT;    Grown up enough to have some out-of-character thoughts about
Donna, too.
 &HT;    ``I wanted Donna to turn into an evil tramp on the show,'' she
jokes. ``I wanted her to have a nightmare sequence where we all
just totally changed personalities. Donna could have looked at
Dylan (Luke Perry) and said, `Look, all these years I've had the
hots for you. Let's just go for it!'''
 &HT;    As for the show's ending, Spelling has already put in her vote
for the final plot twists.
 &HT;    ``I know the fans would like to see Donna end up with David,''
she says. ``He was her first boyfriend on the show, and they had a
beautiful love story. I'd like to see the show end on a high
point.''
 &HT;    The final episode will be an ending of sorts for a woman who
decided as early as 5 that she wanted to be a television star, and
told her famous daddy so.
 &HT;    ``My Dad said, `Oh, sure, honey. Last week you wanted to be an
ice skater,''' she recalls. ``Then he said, `You really want to do
this? OK, we'll give you a couple of lines in `Vegas.' How's that?'
I said, `It will do.'''
 &HT;    Her next effort was less successful, however.
 &HT;    ``I always wanted to be on `Charlie's Angels,''' Spelling says.
``I wanted to be the little sister of one of the angels. I always
pitched that one to my dad. But I never made it _ he said, `No,
you're not going on shows that have skimpy clothing!'''
 &HT;    She did manage to talk her way aboard ``The Love Boat'' twice,
before being cast in ``Beverly Hills 90210'' at 17.
 &HT;    Despite her youth, Spelling managed to keep her bearings, unlike
such co-stars as wild child Shannen Doherty.
 &HT;    ``The main reason I stayed so stable through the early, crazy
days of the series is because I refused to let fame ruin my life,''
she says. ``If my friends wanted to go to Limited Express, I went
with them. I didn't want to be different. They kept me grounded.''
 &HT;    Still, she admits that she hates the criticism of her looks.
 &HT;    ``I've always been really insecure about myself in that way,''
the actress says. ``Some of the things you've read are so mean. No,
I didn't have a boob job _ I just lost my baby fat. I tried a
Miracle Bra. Is that a crime?''
 &HT;    She adds that her thinness comes naturally.
 &HT;    ``I can eat anything I want and it doesn't matter,'' she says.
``People always think that's so uncommon, but I have a lot of
friends who are just like me _ we can eat pizza and hot fudge
sundaes, we don't gain an ounce.
 &HT;    ``I just hope that teens out there don't try to look as thin as
me if that's not natural to their bodies,'' she adds.
 &HT;    Looking ahead, Spelling would love to find a zany sitcom for
herself.
 &HT;    ``I'd like to do something wacky like `I Love Lucy,''' she says.
``I know there are a lot of shows about young married couples, but
I think I could bring something fun and new to that scenario.''
 &HT;    In the meantime, however, she lives a quiet life, single but
hardly in the same league as Donna, who these days on ``90210'' is
trying to fend off the advances of two suitors.
 &HT;    ``At home it's just me and my dog,'' she says with a sigh. ``I
guess I have to live vicariously through my character when it comes
to romance. I can't seem to find anyone.''
 &HT;    Most of her nights are spent watching old movies and television
reruns into the wee hours, she adds. She can't sleep without the
television being on all night long.
 &HT;    ``The worst is if I flip by an old episode of `90210,'''
Spelling says. ``Those shows are like a yearbook of past bad hair
styles. I always wince and grab the remote as quickly as
possible.''

BORDER CRACKDOWN TAXES FEDERAL COURTROOMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER  
 and MARO ROBBINS  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEL RIO, Texas _ The government's drive to crack down on illegal
immigration and the drug trade across the southern border has
flooded federal courtrooms in the small cities that officials say
are ill equipped to handle the influx.
</P>
<P>
   With record numbers of Border Patrol agents being deployed, the
count of those facing federal drug and immigration charges along
the border has doubled and even tripled in some places.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have declared war against (illegal) immigration,'' Kent
Schaeffer, a Houston attorney on the board of directors for the
National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, said of federal
authorities. ``Nobody cares what prosecutions are for; they are
looking at numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Marshals Service, which guards federal prisoners, is so
outnumbered that it admits violating security guidelines as it
tries to handle the booming inmate population.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure on the courts is such that it is not unusual for two
dozen people to be read their rights or for a federal judge to
sentence 10 people standing side-by-side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are swamped,'' said Greg Serres, lead prosecutor
for the Southern District of Texas. Yet he said he did not think
the crowding ``has had an adverse impact on justice in South
Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Schaeffer said there was nothing illegal in the way the
authorities are handling the situation. But, he said, ``Just
because it is legal does not make it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing illustrates the situation more than the plight of
courtrooms in smaller border cities, such as Del Rio, population
35,000, and Laredo, with nearly 170,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the federal court in Houston handled 286 criminal
cases, more than twice the number in Del Rio and slightly more than
in Laredo.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Laredo had 989 cases _ some of which included
multiple defendants _ nearly double the volume in Houston. And Del
Rio handled 606 cases last year, 100 more than in Houston. Houston,
the nation's fourth largest city, has a population of more than 1.7
million.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Edward C. Prado of San Antonio, who was
recently dispatched to help handle the backlog of cases in El Paso,
accepted more pleas in one day than the average federal judge hears
in a year, according to figures from the Administrative Office of
the U.S. Courts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, federal probation officers in places like Laredo
explain they don't have time to check where felons newly released
from prison are living and working. And marshals, increasingly busy
with prisoners on the border, say they have less manpower to hunt
fugitives.
</P>
<P>
   With Congress seeking more agents for the border, some are
wondering how the judicial system will handle more immigration or
smuggling cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are seeing the back end of the system stretched to the
limit,'' said John Kelly, the federal prosecutor who oversees
Justice Department activities for the Southwest border.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years have passed since hundreds of frustrated California
activists aimed their headlights at the hills of Tijuana, Mexico,
to illuminate popular crossing spots for streams of undocumented
immigrants headed north.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the campaign, known as ``Light Up The Border,''
the federal government has built fences, installed stadium-style
lights and almost doubled the size of the Border Patrol to more
than 8,000 agents.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way has come a stream of highly touted initiatives.
Agents massed along the border for Operation Hold the Line in El
Paso, Operation Gatekeeper in Southern California and, most
recently, Operation Rio Grande in South Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a recent General Accounting Office report concludes, it
is too early to tell if the strategy has reduced the number of
people illegally entering the country or merely shifted their
paths.
</P>
<P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The busiest mornings in court come when judges inventory cases.
Hearings are quick. No jury is required, nor are witnesses or
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   But when some judges determine which defendants plead and which
demand trials, every inmate and attorney is present.
</P>
<P>
   It is a massive undertaking, not unlike a cattle call.
</P>
<P>
   Prisoners are linked by chains on ankles and/or wrists. Once the
judge addresses their cases, they leave. Before the cushions cool,
a new round of prisoners sits.
</P>
<P>
   Judges increasingly are on the road from San Antonio, Austin,
Midland, and soon Louisiana, as they lend a gavel in understaffed
courthouses along the Texas-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Fred Biery of San Antonio is among those
doing double duty. To reduce travel, he hands down sentences by
two-way video conference.
</P>
<P>
   Defendants tremble and hang their heads before a camera and
monitor mounted on the judge's bench in the Del Rio courtroom,
while Biery pronounces judgment from 144 miles away in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Gus de la Vina, national chief of the Border Patrol, insists his
forces are on the verge of controlling much of a region that has
long seemed unmanageable.
</P>
<P>
   One sign immigrants think twice before wading into the river or
hopping the fences is that apprehensions have fallen by roughly
half in the El Paso and San Diego sectors since the buildup began
along the border in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have proven that, with the right support, what was once a
distant possibility is becoming a distinct reality,'' De la Vina
said.

 THE WORKING WORLD OF ANI DiFRANCO  
 (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to StarBeat, a weekly
package of five intriguing features with color art.) 
 (Includes a color slide of singer/songwriter Ani DiFranco
performing onstage.) 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Ani DiFranco may not be a latter-day version of Mother Jones,
Lucy Parsons or the other labor heroines of the past. But ``Fellow
Workers,'' the Buffalo-based singer/songwriter's latest album, is
the most significant labor commentary from any contemporary pop
performer this side of Billy Bragg.
 &HT;    It's also her second collaboration with the activist and folk
legend Bruce ``Utah'' Phillips, who provides the album's vocals,
offering plainspoken dissertations about incidents and figures in
the history of labor and singing standards such as ``Joe Hill,''
``Bread and Roses'' and ``Dump the Bosses.''
 &HT;    DiFranco and her band _ plus guests such as Soul Asylum's Dave
Pirner, who plays trumpet on one number _ dress up the classic
songs with sympathetic soundscapes, mostly improvised, that range
from haunting, dreamy weaves to rootsy shuffles and uptempo
thrashing behind Phillips' scratchy but impassioned vocals.
 &HT;    ``Fellow Workers'' is a logical extension of ``The Past Didn't
Go Anywhere'' (1996), the innovative album for which she created
music for recordings Phillips made separately. ``Fellow Workers''
is a more organic project _ the duo joined forces for two
performances before invitation-only audiences at Kingsway Studios
in New Orleans, after which DiFranco waded through the tapes to
shape the eventual album.
 &HT;    ``I had lots of tape and lots of material, and I sort of saw in
there the shape of an album about labor history and solidarity and
things like that,'' says the 28-year-old DiFranco, herself a
``card-carrying musician's-union member since puberty'' who as a
matter of principle has canceled performances rather than cross
picket lines.
 &HT;    Beyond the labor standards, the album really shines when
Phillips, the son of two labor organizers, waxes wise and
historical about Mother Jones in ``The Most Dangerous Woman'' and
Lucy Parsons in ``Shoot or Stab Them,'' about the 1912
Massachusetts textile strike in ``Lawrence'' and, in several songs,
about the Industrial Workers of the World, better known as the
``Wobblies.''
 &HT;    ``These old songs, these old stories _ why tell them? What do
they mean?'' the 64-year-old Phillips asks _ rhetorically, of
course _ in one piece that declares ``the long memory is the most
radical idea in America.''
 &HT;    ``When I went to high school,'' he says, ``I got the history of
the people who owned the wealth of the country, but none of the
history of the people who created it. And that was deliberate,
wasn't it?
 &HT;    ``If I wanted a true history of where I came from, the working
class, I had to go to my elders ... They gave me a history that is
more profound and more beautiful and more powerful and more
passionate _ and, ultimately, more useful _ than the best damn
history book I've ever read.''
 &HT;    Not typical pop fare, to be sure, but DiFranco has never been
much concerned with mainstream success. She releases her albums
through her own label, Righteous Babe Records, and reaches an
audience primarily made up of college and high-school students and
20-somethings. And, as far as she's concerned, that young audience
may not be able to relate to these songs, but that's all the more
reason for her to record them and hopefully open some eyes.
 &HT;    ``I think a lot of young people don't really have a
consciousness about such a thing,'' DiFranco says. ``I think these
days young people are sort of born into this disillusionment that
labor unions are inherently corrupt and in the way ... But I think
that there's a lot of really important history that young people
don't necessarily know about, these days.
 &HT;    ``There're so many un-unionized large corporations that
everybody seems to work for right now,'' she says, ``and there's
not really a consciousness of `We need a union.' I think we need to
get back to that awareness ... Now you don't have a Rockefeller or
some big-bellied line boss exploiting you, you have some
multinational, nameless corporation _ but I think the dynamic
therein is much the same, and we need to learn from our history.''
 &HT;    There are few better teachers than the Cleveland-born Phillips,
a former railrider, printer, dishwasher and stock clerk whose
bitter experiences during the Korean War turned him to activism. He
helped found the Poor People's Party in Utah, and made an
unsuccessful 1968 run for the United States Senate on the Peace and
Freedom ticket.
 &HT;    After losing his job with the Utah State Archives following that
campaign, Phillips took to entertaining, traveling the country in a
Volkswagen minibus and spinning tales and songs for whoever would
have him. He continues to host a syndicated weekly radio show,
``Loafer's Glory: Hobo Jungle of the Mind.''
 &HT;    But Phillips, who has a heart condition that no longer allows
him to travel extensively, is reaching his widest audience yet
through DiFranco, who says she's happy to do her part to bring the
spotlight to Phillips and his message.
 &HT;    ``I look at the albums I've done for Utah more as a vehicle for
him, really,'' DiFranco says. ``It's really a calculated effort on
my part to try and get Utah to my audience.
 &HT;    ``Utah has been mostly known in acoustic- and folk-music circles
and progressive political circles,'' she says. ``In terms of just
the kids today, there weren't a lot of them that knew his name. So
that's changing a little bit, which is a good feeling.''
 &HT;    With ``Fellow Workers'' in the can, however, DiFranco has turned
her attention to her own work. She and her band have a long summer
tour ahead _ which, she hints, may include some surprise guest
appearances at Lilith Fair dates.
 &HT;    Then she plans to start work on her own next album, though she
won't hazard a guess as to what creative path she'll follow.
 &HT;    ``I try not to think too much before I start playing music about
how I should play music,'' she says. ``I just sort of do it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Since its earliest days, television has specialized in sexy
stars who brought color even to the age of black and white.
</P>
<P>
   But who are today's sexiest stars? Three TV Guide Canada staff
writers team up for an admittedly subjective _ but so what? _ look
at some men and women who can make even the hottest summer day a
little hotter yet. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; GILLIAN ANDERSON &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As David Duchovny's opposite number on ``The X-Files,'' Gillian
Anderson's smoldering Scully is the perfect foil for Duchovny's
excitable Mulder.
</P>
<P>
   With her blazing red hair and a look that vaguely suggests a
1940s pinup girl, Anderson is a refreshing break from television's
endless stream of blonde waifs.
</P>
<P>
   As much as we love ``The X-Files,'' we can't wait for Gillian to
move on to different things _ and to show us more. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; JENNIFER ANISTON &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forget the haircut or the craze that it caused. Jennifer Aniston
could have a crew cut and she'd still make us drool.
</P>
<P>
   When ``Friends'' was first launched, her character, Rachel
Green, started out as a ditzy, selfish rich girl. But during the
course of five seasons, she's blossomed into a strong, confident,
go-get-'em woman who seems to know exactly what she wants.
</P>
<P>
   For that _ and, OK, for the great hair, too _ Aniston gets our
vote for the sexiest girlFriend. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; CHRISTINA APPLEGATE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, Christina Applegate wouldn't have had a chance
at making this list. Why not? Because, beyond her obvious physical
appeal, there was nothing sexy about her ``Married ... with
Children'' character, dumb-blonde-and-slutty Kelly Bundy.
</P>
<P>
   Now that she's on ``Jesse'' and playing a smart single mom,
Applegate exudes oodles of grace and charm. She's the kind of woman
every mother wants her son to find _ a modern-day Valerie
Bertinelli, cute as a button with that girl-next-door appeal. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; BRUNO CAMPOS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are only two words to describe Latin sensation Bruno
Campos: Hubba hubba!
</P>
<P>
   The exotic star of ``Jesse,'' who was born in Brazil but grew up
in Toronto, Bahrain and Houston as the son of an international
banker, adds sizzle to any scene.
</P>
<P>
   Only 24 now, Campos undoubtedly played a part in securing a Best
Foreign Film Oscar nomination for his 1996 breakout film, ``O
Quatrilho.'' &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; KIM DELANEY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's Kim Delaney's subtleness that caught our eye.
</P>
<P>
   As Det. Diane Russell on ``NYPD Blue,'' this is a woman who
finds a way to look sexy in slacks every single week _ not to
mention in a bit less during those love scenes with Jimmy Smits
back when. In fact, her good looks and NYPD no-nonsense image
earned her a modeling contract with Revlon.
</P>
<P>
   In her mid-to-late 30s, Delaney represents what the British call
``the thinking man's crumpet,'' a woman both sexy and smart. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; DAVID DUCHOVNY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The smoldering ``X-Files'' star, with his deadpan sense of
humor, is a thinking woman's Pop-Tart, then.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Princeton and Yale, David Duchovny was actually
working on his doctorate when he started a career in acting. We're
sure it wasn't his smarts alone, however, that snagged him dates
with the likes of Winona Ryder and Sheryl Lee before he married Tea
Leoni.
</P>
<P>
   Could it have been that scholarship-level basketball player's
body? &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; HEATHER LOCKLEAR &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Isn't it obvious? Heather Locklear embodies the sexy,
California-girl archetype.
</P>
<P>
   Blond, athletically toned, perky and wearing a dress size that
most teenagers can't fit into, Locklear has been turning viewers'
heads since she appeared on ``CHiPS'' in 1977. In the 1980s she
began stopping traffic in her ``T.J. Hooker'' uniform and stealing
scenes as siren Sammy Jo in ``Dynasty.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was during her six years on ``Melrose Place'' that
Locklear's barely-there business suits and ballsy business sense
established her screen reputation.
</P>
<P>
   We can't wait to see her on ``Spin City'' this fall. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; ERIC McCORMACK &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eric McCormack may have been impressing stage audiences for
years, but it wasn't until he won the role of the
sometimes-good-and-sometimes-bad Col. Francis Clay Mosby on
``Lonesome Dove: The Series'' that a wider audience fell for his
dashing good looks.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as gay attorney Will Truman on ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' McCormack
has not only found a 20th-century role, but his appeal has crossed
the gender barrier, too. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; DYLAN McDERMOTT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As Bobby Donnell on ``The Practice,'' Dylan McDermott oozes both
confidence and brooding intensity.
</P>
<P>
   While it doesn't hurt that he's got a sleek physique and classic
good looks, what makes McDermott sexiest is his quiet demeanor, as
seen on talk shows and in interviews. Many women say that what
makes a man most desirable is when he's hot but he doesn't seem to
know it.
</P>
<P>
   Dylan, trust us, there's no reason for modesty. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; GLORIA REUBEN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If keeping a positive attitude in the face of constant adversity
makes one sexy, count Canadian-born Gloria Reuben as the sexiest
soul on television.
</P>
<P>
   Her ``ER'' character, Jeanie Boulet, has faced unemployment, the
death of a young friend and, of course, HIV. If it wasn't for her
beautiful smile, viewers might think she'd be ready to pack it in.
</P>
<P>
   Reuben's quiet elegance brings a much-needed refinement to the
otherwise dank halls of County General. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; SCOTT WOLF &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The delightfully boyish good looks that landed him guest spots
on teenybopper shows such as ``Saved By the Bell'' and ``Blossom''
helped turn Scott Wolf into a star as the sensitive, thoughtful
brother in ``Party of Five.''
</P>
<P>
   At only 5-foot-8, with a penchant for casual, sporty attire,
``Scooter's'' cute quotient is off the scale. He's recently brought
it to Broadway, where he's taken over for Christian Slater in the
lead role in the hit play, ``Side Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 31, the adorable Wolf continues to convincingly play
characters at least 10 years his junior. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; NOAH WYLE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This man can melt hearts when he smiles. As ``ER's'' Dr. John
Carter, Noah Wyle is just the kind of guy a girl wants pressing a
stethoscope to her chest.
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old Wyle is funny and upper-class cute _ note the
patrician nose _ and wins over audiences with Carter's earnest
belief in doing the right thing. Viewers have watched him grow up
through the past five seasons on ``ER,'' from boyish nerd to
confident medic.
</P>
<P>
   He's someone fans can realistically dream about dating _ proving
that George Clooney's Dr. Ross wasn't ``ER's'' only hunk in a white
lab coat. &QL;

TEEN'S `CONTROLLED SCREAM' LANDS HER ON JAY LENO SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIKA HAYASAKI  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Tawnie Keaton, 13, mimics the shrill screech of a sea
gull so masterfully that even seasoned bird-watchers have trouble
deciphering her call from the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   It's a talent that has earned her a guest appearance on ``The
Tonight Show with Jay Leno.''
</P>
<P>
   Keaton will show off her talent to a nationwide audience
Wednesday, along with guests who specialize in dolphin, whale and
moose calls. The eighth-grader was awarded the all-expenses-paid
trip to California after the program's producers learned she was a
two-time winner of Port Orchard's Sea Gull Calling Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Keaton said she has never been on television and she is fretting
over what to wear.
</P>
<P>
   The Port Orchard teen, who plays basketball, enjoys science and
plans to run for student government next year, participated in Port
Orchard's contest about seven times since 1990. She won ``Most
Authentic Call'' in 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like a controlled scream to me,'' Keaton said.
``I can control the pitch and sound.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen to 40 bird callers participate in the Port Orchard
contest, which takes place each spring. Children and adults compete
for best call, best costume and who attracts the most birds.
</P>
<P>
   ``She watched the contest one year and tried it,'' said her
mother, Carolyn. ``It's just something she does with her tongue and
mouth ... she can do it behind you and it sounds like a sea gull is
behind you.''
</P>
<P>
   A producer of ``The Tonight Show'' contacted Port Orchard's
contest organizers a few months ago and asked them to refer a
memorable winner.
</P>
<P>
   Keaton, a bubbly teenager, stood out among other winners.
</P>
<P>
   After interviewing Keaton and watching a videotape of her
performing the call, producers asked her to fly to California from
her home on the Kitsap Peninsula, west of Seattle, and appear on a
special animal call segment.
</P>
<P>
   Keaton performed the call once in front of classmates and said
it was embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people laughed at me because it's a talent I haven't
really shared with my friends,'' Keaton said. ``They laughed and
said, `It sounds like a sea gull, I can't believe it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Allison Frye, 13, a friend of Keaton, admits she finds the
unique talent ``a little wierd.'' Nevertheless, Wednesday night
she'll be videotaping her friend screeching like a bird for the
world to see.

 &HT;    Unusual clinic tends heart of jazz
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Earl Turbinton is a 57-year-old saxophonist with
connections to the biggest names in jazz, but he has no health
insurance. He has played with B.B. King, he taught jazz to Wynton
and Branford Marsalis and new singing sensation Cassandra Wilson,
and he has performed all over the world. But he can't afford to pay
to see a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, while playing a gig in New York City, part of his face
went numb. He didn't know until almost a year later that he had
suffered a small stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have insurance,'' Turbinton said. ``And I was so
broke, I was playing for tips in front of Macy's that Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Turbinton no longer ignores his ailments, thanks to the New
Orleans Musicians' Clinic, a low-cost health care center that
opened downtown last year. For about $10 a visit, he can get
everything from a checkup to major surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've needed this,'' said Turbinton, as he sat in an examining
room in an African outfit of bright orange and red linen. He
clutched a cigarette lighter in one hand and a muffin, taken from a
box on someone's desk, in the other. He let out an earth-shattering
cough, and rubbed his left foot, wrapped in an ace bandage. He'd
injured it recently and was at the clinic to get X-rays.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans is the birthplace of jazz, and musicians, like
chefs, are revered in the city. But many musicians live hand to
mouth, and a visit to the doctor is an unimaginable luxury. And
since they are paid in cash, job by job, they usually are not part
of any group health insurance plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We targeted this group because they are so far removed from
any type of health care or insurance,'' said Johann Bultman, a
former funeral home director who is one of the major organizers of
the clinic. ``For years, we've been trying to figure out how to
help them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bultman is involved with all three of the organizations
supporting the clinic. He is on the boards of the New Orleans Jazz
and Heritage Foundation, which puts on the annual Jazz Fest, and of
Louisiana State University's Healthcare Network. He is an
administrator with the third group, Daughters of Charity Services
of New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   The jazz foundation has raised enough money to get the clinic
started and to pay the salaries of the LSU medical staffers who see
the musicians, but donations are needed to keep it afloat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to impress upon people that we need to support our
musicians; they are one of the major reasons people are drawn
here,'' Bultman said.
</P>
<P>
   The musicians themselves put together a CD called ``Get You A
Healin'' to raise money for the clinic. Songs by George Porter Jr.,
Irma Thomas and Tiny Town are all medically themed.
</P>
<P>
   The clinic sees patients two afternoons a week and is hoping to
expand to three. After musicians submit their applications, the
information is reviewed by local radio station WWOZ-FM to be sure
the applicants are, in fact, professional musicians. Then they come
in for a full physical.
</P>
<P>
   Musicians are not quite like other patients, said Carol
Schwaner, the nurse practitioner who runs the clinic. They're
wonderfully colorful, coming in with wild clothing and wilder
stories. Many need help kicking drugs or alcohol. Some have come in
with advanced cancer or heart disease and have needed immediate
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Their business is hazardous to the ears, the throats and to the
muscles and bones from carrying heavy equipment. Schwaner has
treated musicians with damage to all these body parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most musicians have really neglected their health,'' she said.
``They haven't had any routine care.''
</P>
<P>
   And they are difficult patients; they miss appointments or show
up late, she said. Many don't have phones and can't be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Turbinton sat with Schwaner toward the end of his visit and
discussed when he should return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have such a hard time reaching you,'' she said. ``I get test
results and then I can't reach you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll call you,'' he assured her.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the more famous musicians get miffed when they are asked
to pay what they can afford for their care.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think the service should be free,'' Bultman explained.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem is that musicians live outside the systems
the rest of the world takes for granted. Turbinton, who calls
himself a mystic and believes music has healing powers, never
bothered with anything so mundane and earthbound as a checkup. It
took real ailments for him to realize even musicians need tuning up
now and then.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have three root canals I've needed for a long time,'' he
said. ``With this clinic, I may be able to get that repaired.''
</P>
<P>
   He coughed again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carol says I am pre-emphysemic,'' he said. Schwaner nodded.
``I've been smoking for 50 years, since cigarettes were two for a
nickel.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwaner gave him antibiotics to clear up his cough, and told
him to stay off his left foot.
</P>
<P>
   Turbinton said he was reluctant to come to the clinic because of
the way he'd been treated at other free medical facilities, such as
Charity Hospital just down the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``They treat you like a number,'' he said. ``But here, maybe
because they know the idiosyncrasies of artists, they are real kind
to us.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of uninsured residents are reluctant to use Charity
Hospital, Bultman said. Although Louisiana is one of only two
states with medical services that are free to any citizen, many
Louisianans forego health care because they find the system too
intimidating and confusing, he said. As a result, residents,
particularly in New Orleans, are among the unhealthiest in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we decided to target specific groups and entice them to
come in for care,'' Bultman said. ``The coolest people in
neighborhoods here are the musicians. By targeting a group of
icons, we hope to entice others to seek health care as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the clinic entices the musicians themselves by making
them feel special. This clinic isn't just for anyone, it's for
them.
</P>
<P>
   It is working so well _ more than 200 musicians have tried the
clinic since it opened a year ago _ that Bultman and others are
setting up a similar clinic for artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be one for dancers and writers as well,''
Turbinton said.

ARGENTINA'S ONCE-FLASHY PRESIDENT FINDS HIS LEGACY TARNISHED 
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ The wild, mutton chop sideburns are
gone. The televised cheek-to-cheek tangos with marquee entertainers
are a thing of the past. And when President Carlos Saul Menem does
take the occasional spin in a hot sports car these days, his
bodyguards no longer need to make death-defying weaves through
traffic to chase after him.
</P>
<P>
   At age 69 and in his final five months in office, Menem still
makes good copy _ but now the press attention is focused on the
presidential psyche. Argentine magazines, quoting anonymous
sources, report that Menem is depressed, lonely and bitter because
many of his closest allies, including his hand-picked vice
president, have abandoned him.
</P>
<P>
   He reportedly mutters about his declining poll numbers and
wonders why the people have suddenly forgotten how he saved the
country from hyperinflation and power-hungry generals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guerrillas are attacking 25 miles from Bogota and no one says
Pastrana will fall,'' Menem snapped during an interview on a recent
campaign trip, referring to President Andres Pastrana of Colombia.
``In France there was a strike that lasted more than a month and
Chirac continued in power, as did Jospin,'' he said, referring to
President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who think that my government is going to fall have
dictatorial mentalities,'' he added, alluding to criticism of his
handling of a series of recent crises.
</P>
<P>
   Jabbing his fingers on the table, he added: ``My work has really
been exceptional not just economically, but politically and
culturally as well. No one in the world can match our process of
transformation, especially not in Latin America.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Menem boasts of his legacy, Argentines are not certain
whether they have been on anything more than a dizzying
roller-coaster ride during their president's decade in power.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer pace at which Menem swept into power in July 1989 from
the craggy little province of La Rioja and broke all the rules of
Argentine politics seems now to be a memory for the history books.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, Menem slashed the unwieldy government bureaucracy
left behind by Gen. Juan Domingo Peron, brought the army and
powerful unions to heel and attached his country's once
nationalistic foreign policy squarely to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But the luster of that legacy has now been tarnished by his
ultimately failed on-again, off-again efforts to run for a third
term despite a constitutional ban on it, by a deepening recession,
a rise in crime and unemployment and a growing number of scandals
surrounding his administration.
</P>
<P>
   He has become a punching bag for the two leading presidential
candidates, including the standard-bearer of his own party. His
last ambitious policy initiative, a proposal to convert his
nation's currency to the dollar, has drawn skepticism in Washington
and ridicule in Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done what I had to do,'' Menem said in the interview
aboard Tango 01, the Boeing 757 presidential jet. ``The world
economic crisis was not in our calculations.''
</P>
<P>
   Menem laughed off the psychological analysis offered by the news
magazines, saying: ``I keep my balance. As Rudyard Kipling advised,
I shut my ears to the applause that comes with success and the boos
that come with failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two months, Menem's labor minister was forced to
resign in disgrace, and his education minister quit over a proposed
cut in university financing that Menem was then forced to reverse.
</P>
<P>
   Menem looked particularly off-balance two weeks ago during a
truckers' strike that left supermarkets short of supplies. First he
threatened to install a state of siege, only to cave in later to
demands that a vehicle tax be eased. Menem tried to regain his
footing with an agreement with Britain reinitiating commercial
flights to the Falklands, but the sense of drift persists and has
helped drive the local stock market into a slump.
</P>
<P>
   ``Menem has lost his seductive powers,'' said Olga Wornat, an
Argentine journalist who is writing Menem's biography. ``Ten years
is a long time, and since 1995 he has not come up with solutions to
problems like unemployment, insecurity about rising crime and
education _ to the point where people don't find his jokes funny
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   In his appearances, Menem acts as unruffled as ever, and he
still has the flair and energy to invite Argentina's greatest
tennis player, Guillermo Vilas, to be his partner in a doubles
match at the Presidential Palace. But his public comments are
becoming increasingly defensive and even sometimes take on a
whining quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Memories are fragile, and sometimes memories are not
objective,'' he said at a recent news conference after a reporter
had the gumption to ask him if he might be forced to resign from
office early due to his dropping effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Menem was still smarting from the question _ which harkened back
to the premature resignation of Menem's predecessor, Raul Alfonsin,
10 years ago in the face of galloping inflation and repeated army
coup attempts _ an hour later aboard his presidential jet. In an
effort to polish his image, Menem has launched a television and
billboard advertising campaign to remind Argentines of his
accomplishments. ``Ten years that changed history,'' is the mantra
_ one that will be repeated in the three-to-four-volume memoir that
he plans to publish by the end of the year.

ACTIVIST TRYING TO SAVE SEATTLE'S CREEKS FINDS AN ALLY IN CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LISA STIFFLER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Cane-wielding but no granny, Nancy Malmgren is a
70-year-old spark plug leading the fight to save Seattle's urban
creeks.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Malmgren has devotedly worked to restore Pipers
Creek, joining with neighborhood volunteers to stock salmon
fingerlings and replant native vegetation along the water's edge.
</P>
<P>
   Now she's getting a big boost from the Seattle Millennium
Project, which has as one of its goals urban creek restoration.
Across the city, residents like Malmgren are working to improve the
streams for fish, fowl and their own children.
</P>
<P>
   As Malmgren strolls the Pipers Creek trail in Carkeek Park in
northwest Seattle, she stops to thank a man for keeping his dog on
a leash _ and out of the stream _ and abandons her cane to fix a
segment of rough-hewn fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could bring every watershed resident to Pipers Creek and
show them this ... '' she says, scanning the babbling brook and
canopy of lush vegetation.
</P>
<P>
   Creek restoration will work, she continues, only if residents
realize that ``what they do upstream is so damned important.''
</P>
<P>
   For Pipers Creek, ``upstream'' covers a lot of territory. Nearly
2,000 acres in northwest Seattle comprise the creek's watershed.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that land is developed, and rain sends water rushing
down the pavement in torrents, carrying pollutants like lawn
pesticides and oil into Pipers Creek.
</P>
<P>
   The force of all the rain water can scour prime fish habitat and
clog waterways such as Pipers with silt.
</P>
<P>
   Preserving urban streams is an age-old problem for the city.
Since logging and development began 147 years ago when settlers
moved from Alki Point across Elliott Bay, the Seattle waterways
have been vulnerable to man-made pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Over-fishing in Pipers Creek began in 1916 and the last spawning
salmon was sighted there in 1927, according to Malmgren.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, an early pioneer family was sickened by
drinking polluted water from a Pipers Creek tributary that now
bears their family name _ Venema.
</P>
<P>
   While it's still not safe for drinking _ or even swimming _
Pipers Creek is making a slow comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Countless hours and dollars have been spent resuscitating the
waterway, and plans are in the works to take the restoration a step
further.
</P>
<P>
   In less than a year, jackhammers will tear up the 11700 block of
Second Avenue Northwest, transforming this ordinary Broadview
street into a tree-lined, meandering country lane.
</P>
<P>
   The project will temporarily disrupt traffic and much of the
street parking will be lost, but nearly all of the block's
residents support the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to improve the street and improve the
environment,'' resident Tom Rosplock said. ``I think there will be
a lot of neighborhoods who will be kind of jealous.''
</P>
<P>
   This unique piece of the city's Millennium Project is a
never-before-tried engineering experiment that could decrease
stormwater runoff and mitigate such adverse impacts on Pipers
Creek.
</P>
<P>
   If it works in northwest Seattle, the city may try the same
approach in other parts of town.
</P>
<P>
   Once narrowed, the block of Second Avenue Northwest will be
lined with sloping ditches called ``swales'' that allow for
increased absorption of stormwater and slower water flow from the
streets to the creeks.
</P>
<P>
   The renovations are expected to take about six months to
complete, and success will be determined in
</P>
<P>
   part from before-and-after measurements of runoff volume and
flow rates.
</P>
<P>
   Diana Gale, director of Seattle Public Utilities, said, ``If it
turns out to be cost-effective ... we're going to be doing more of
these. It's less expensive than putting in underground drainage.''
</P>
<P>
   The city estimates it costs a minimum of $400,000 per block to
add sidewalks and drainage.
</P>
<P>
   A complete renovation _ including curbs, gutters and sidewalks _
costs about $850,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Broadview experiment is expected to cost between $600,000
and $800,000, and while already less expensive than a complete
renovation, the cost of the environmentally friendly street design
is expected to come down as the city learns more about what works.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, improvements are being planned for other neighborhood
watersheds.
</P>
<P>
   The Millennium Project will fund facelifts for creeks in all
four corners of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton, Longfellow and Taylor creeks will be rebuilt to make
it easier for fish to swim up and down the streams.
</P>
<P>
   Native trees also will be planted along banks and detention
ponds created to retain, filter and slowly release stormwater.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Urban Creeks Legacy Program,'' which includes Pipers
Creek improvements, will cost $4.5 million, funded by Seattle
Public Utilities.
</P>
<P>
   While there is much support for creek restoration, even the
movement's most staunch backers say it's an uphill, slow-moving
battle.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the restorations are successful, ``we may not know in
our lifetime,'' said Vivian Phillips, spokeswoman for Seattle Mayor
Paul Schell.
</P>
<P>
   But what's more important is the ``good stewardship''
demonstrated by the improvements.
</P>
<P>
   And Malmgren is the quintessential steward of Pipers Creek,
looking over every aspect of its maintenance and acting as liaison
between wildlife and visitors.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent walk through Carkeek, she paused to tell a shirtless
23-year-old named Huckleberry Palmer the history of Pipers Creek
and recount her efforts to get people involved with the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to get people connected and willing to make changes
in their personal behavior,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Malmgren cannot work at her present pace forever and looks
to the schools and young people to continue her fight for the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get to be 70, you wonder who's going to carry the
torch,'' Malmgren said.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to the young man perched on the fence at the creek's
bank she asks, ``Are you going to carry the torch, Huckleberry?''

 BUENOS AIRES: end of the year.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Menem took office 10 years ago, Argentina was sinking into
an abyss. The inflation rate ran to nearly 5,000 percent, and
civilian rule was shaken by periodic military uprisings. The
bloated, corrupt state bureaucracy meant that Argentines had to
wait months to connect a telephone line or fix a leaky water pipe.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with the peso pegged to the dollar, inflation is below
one percent. By selling off virtually every government agency,
slashing regulations and tying the economy to the Mercosur trade
union with its neighbors, industrial production has grown by 40
percent and per capita income has grown from $2,100 to $9,800 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say Menem made a deal with the devil by granting a
blanket amnesty to the military, but by doing so he was able to get
concessions from the generals. He cut military spending by hundreds
of millions of dollars, and abolished the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Menem found a new mission for the military. He sent two ships
and soldiers to help out the allies in the gulf war and later
contributed to United Nations peacekeeping missions all over the
globe, from Cyprus to Haiti. And today, because of a loophole in
the amnesty, several former junta leaders are under house arrest
and awaiting trial on allegations they kidnapped the newborn
infants of imprisoned pregnant mothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think historians will be kinder to Menem than his
contemporaries,'' said Joaquin Morales Sola, a columnist at La
Nacion. ``All Argentine presidents leave office saying they are
unappreciated by the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, most of Menem's achievements, as even his supporters
concede, came in his first four years in office. His second term
has been marred by two deep recessions, including the present one
that has brought the unemployment rate to nearly 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And for more than a year, the Argentine media have been harping
on allegations that top government officials have enriched
themselves in a variety of schemes _ from siphoning government
money to pork barrel projects in Menem's native region of La Rioja,
to trafficking in arms, to taking bribes from a variety of
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no evidence published that directly links Menem
to corruption, but the suggestion is nearly always there.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I have, I have worked for,'' he said. ``When people on
the left criticize my spending I say they ought to see how Fidel
flies around in his three jets with his entire coterie, and that's
a Communist regime. We only fly in one plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Menem said he will set the record straight, and tell all in his
memoirs beginning with his Syrian immigrant home life, when his
family's poverty forced him to shine shoes and sell newspapers in
the streets to help his father and mother make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would clarify ``lies'' that he converted from Islam
to Roman Catholicism simply to run for the presidency. He will tell
how Peron took a shine to him and helped launch his political
career. Readers will learn how Menem sheltered and fed Montonero
guerrillas in the 1970's, acts that landed him in prison under the
military dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   And as for his personal life, he said, ``I'm going to write
about things that have touched me deeply, particularly my romances
_ which have not been few.''
</P>
<P>
   Menem has already lived a very public life. Every newspaper in
Buenos Aires revealed every lurid detail when he locked his wife,
Zulema, out of the presidential palace to end their marriage early
in his first term. When his son Carlos died in a helicopter crash
four years ago, the president's mourning was open and tearful. Even
his personal fortune-teller has granted interviews to the Argentine
and international press.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a public man should communicate with his people,''
Menem said. ``The people have a right to know.''
</P>
<P>
   There were still glimmers of the old Menem magic the other day
when the President Menem traveled to the Brazilian border to
inaugurate a new multimillion-dollar tourist footpath overlooking
Iguazu Falls. A magnificent rainbow formed the backdrop for the
president as he posed for the phalanx of photographers who still
record his every public move.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a dapper double-breasted blue blazer, Menem kissed
babies like an old campaigner. The troops were there to salute, and
the local machine of his Justicialist Party managed to turn out a
respectable crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The people applauded warmly when the local governor, Federico
Ramon Puerta, thanked Menem for creating ``a new Argentina.'' As
Menem nodded in agreement, Governor Puerta went on: ``For 200 years
not as much was done in this country as has been done in the last
ten. Democracy has been consolidated. You have eradicated the
threat of coups and given us a stable economic system with the
capacity to take us into the future.''
</P>
<P>
   There was more hearty applause when Menem declared by decree
that he was cutting their fuel taxes so they could compete better
with the neighboring Brazilians. And in appreciation for the grab
bag of housing and educational subsidies Menem brought them, the
locals gave their president a finely sculptured bow and arrow and
hot cheese bread.
</P>
<P>
   It is days like these, Menem said later on Tango 01, that
convince him that he could be re-elected a second time if the
Constitution did not deny him a third consecutive term.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd win,'' he said, ``like a jockey who comes in first without
having to remove the whip from under his arm.''

KENNEDY'S EXPERIENCE AS PILOT COMES UNDER SCRUTINY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Texas) 
(Eds.: Edd is cq) 
 
By KATHY WALT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, a former U.S. Air Force
pilot who still occasionally flies his personal plane, said Monday
he never would have flown a single-engine plane at night over water
relying only on visual reference points, as John F. Kennedy Jr.
apparently did Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pilots are taught to always be within gliding distance of land
whenever over water in a single-engine plane,'' Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy and his wife, Carolyn, and sister-in-law, Lauren
Bessette, apparently died Friday night when the single-engine Piper
Saratoga that Kennedy was piloting plunged into the Atlantic Ocean
near Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Although Perry would not speculate what might have happened to
cause the plane to crash, civilian pilot Edd Hendee, owner of the
Taste of Texas Restaurant in Houston, said there is no doubt in his
mind it was pilot error.
</P>
<P>
   Hendee, who has more than 1,000 hours flying experience _ 600 of
them in a Saratoga _ has nothing but praise for the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like flying a Suburban,'' he said. ``It's like a big
family station wagon.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kennedy's relative inexperience as a pilot, particularly in
a Saratoga _ he had logged about 100 hours as a private pilot and
had his plane only a short time _ created a situation in which he
never should have left northern New Jersey at dusk, Hendee said.
</P>
<P>
   The comments from Perry and Hendee were in response to questions
after a press conference in which Perry announced the formation of
a Texas Small Business Advisory Council. Hendee is one of 23 Texas
entrepreneurs appointed to the council.
</P>
<P>
   Hendee said he believes the crash was a result of ``a decision
failure,'' not equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Saratoga has one of the finest auto pilots built,'' he
said. ``All he had to do was turn it on and enter (the coordinates
for his destination) and the plane would have automatically flown
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy did not have his instrument flight rating. Such a rating
indicates pilots have undergone additional training and passed
tests on flying in weather conditions _ such as fog or haze _ when
visibility is reduced or non-existent. Kennedy, however, was rated
only for visual flights, meaning he relied on his own vision to
determine his location.
</P>
<P>
   Although weather conditions Friday night were described as
perfect for the evening flight, other pilots reported a heavy haze
on approach to Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got disoriented,'' Hendee said. ``The only way to drop
4,000 feet per minute is to turn the plane upside down.''
</P>
<P>
   National Transportation Safety Board officials said Monday that
shortly before the Kennedy's plane disappeared from radar screens,
it was descending at a rate of more than 4,000 feet per second
</P>
<P>
   It was a tragic mistake, Hendee added, one made too often by
lots of inexperienced pilots who take off at times of day or under
weather conditions they are ill-prepared to handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like putting someone with a learner's permit behind the
wheel of a Greyhound Bus,'' he said.

SOUTH KOREA STOPS BANKS FROM CALLING IN DAEWOO'S LOANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The South Korean government stepped in Monday to prevent
affiliates of the sprawling Daewoo Group from slipping into
bankruptcy and causing a wave of bankruptcies throughout the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of the government, Daewoo's creditor banks agreed
to delay by several months the maturities on 7 trillion won, or
$5.9 billion, of short-term loans that were scheduled for repayment
this week.
</P>
<P>
   The creditors also extended a further 4 trillion won, or $3.4
billion, to Daewoo, which in turn offered collateral in real
estate, equity and the personal assets of Kim Woo Choong, the
powerful chairman of the conglomerate, the second largest in the
nation after the Hyundai Group. Daewoo valued the collateral at 10
trillion won, although some of the equity stakes that went into the
package are in unlisted companies and thus have no independently
assessed value.
</P>
<P>
   The reprieve averted what could have become one of the worst
cascades of bankruptcies in South Korean history, threatening the
nation's recovery from the severe recession that began with the
Asian economic crisis two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Financial Supervisory Commission, South Korea's financial
watchdog, said the crisis was brought on by Daewoo's slow pace of
restructuring, but the commission expressed assurance that the
rescue package announced Monday would renew the conglomerate's
commitment to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Collateral provided by Chairman Kim Woo Choong and Daewoo
affiliates in the form of equity stakes in Daewoo affiliates will
serve to assure that Daewoo pushes forward with restructuring plans
as promised,'' the commission said in a statement. ``As announced,
these equity stakes may be disposed of by creditor institutions in
case restructuring is not carried out in accordance to plan.''
</P>
<P>
   At the least, the relief granted Monday seemed to buy Daewoo
some time.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo has announced various plans to streamline operations,
which range from auto manufacturing to finance to electronics, and
to reduce its $50 billion in debt. It promised to raise $13.6
billion by the end of the year through asset sales and securities
offerings.
</P>
<P>
   But Daewoo has dragged its feet, demanding more for its assets
than potential buyers were willing to pay and thwarting the
government's effort to force major changes at Daewoo.
</P>
<P>
   The company has its vast ship-building, commercial vehicles and
electronics units on the block. It recently sold its electronic
switching equipment unit for $548 million and a Hilton Hotel in
Seoul, and it has dismissed the presidents of 33 of its 50
subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Asset sales, however, are proving to be a slow business at best
in South Korea, and Daewoo's assets are not necessarily the most
attractive. The shipping industry is mired in problems, and the
Daewoo electronics business is considered not as competitive as the
Samsung Electronics Industries and the Hyundai Electronics
Industries Company.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In addition, the plan announced Monday to rescue Daewoo from a
potential disaster contained indications of a political deal. On
June 30, Daewoo Motors' pending purchase of Samsung Motors, the
Samsung group's ill-starred new auto manufacturing unit, fell apart
after the two sides failed to reach an agreement on price. Daewoo
quickly emerged, however, as the likely candidate to buy Samsung's
production plants in Pusan, a region that votes heavily in favor of
the opposition party and one where President Kim Dae Jung can ill
afford the electoral impact of heavy job losses.

SHE'S `DROP DEAD GORGEOUS'   AND DROP DEAD NICE, TOO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Given the insolent young women she has played so
convincingly in movies like ``Wild Things'' and the current beauty
pageant satire, ``Drop Dead Gorgeous,'' it's a surprise to meet
Denise Richards and find her to be so darn ... nice.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not an act. Go behind the glamorous looks that have
left male moviegoers speechless (and women a little green with
envy), and you have an unfailingly polite, friendly Midwestern
woman who would have been perfectly at home in a Norman Rockwell
tableau _ if Rockwell had been into, say, Varga girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is very nice; but when you look at her, you don't expect
that,'' says ``Drop Dead Gorgeous'' director Michael Patrick Jann.
``She's a walking magazine cover, and you expect that a diva
attitude will come along with that. But she has a grace to her.
Sometimes it seems like she's holding something back when all it is
is that she doesn't want to say anything bad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wild Things'' director John McNaughton agrees that
expectations don't jibe with reality when it comes to Richards.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first heard Denise's name, I (heard) she was this
fabulously wealthy princess who was brought up by her parents in
some isolated palace tower and raised to be a movie star,''
McNaughton says. (Interestingly enough, that description fits
Richards' ``Drop Dead Gorgeous'' character to a T.)
</P>
<P>
   ``So when I met her,'' McNaughton continues, ``I was kind of
intimidated by her obvious physical beauty and this myth. When we
got to know one another a little better, I asked her where she was
from _ trying to dig around a little, find out about the whole
palace tower thing. She told me she was from Chicago and that her
dad worked for the phone company.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for the palace tower theory. Richards laughs _ and she
has a big, throaty roar _ about the way her looks inspire certain
presumptions in people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are some people that hope I'm a bitch,'' she
says, laughing with glee. ``Personally, I don't ever want to work
with someone who considers herself a diva, much less be one. Who
has time for that? If I ever got a big head, my family would be the
first people to put me back into line. I'm a nice person, and I
enjoy working with nice people, too.''
</P>
<P>
   And from the way her career is steadily moving forward, people
seem to like working with Richards, too. After taking almost a year
off after ``Wild Things,'' Richards landed a part she seemed born
to play _ the Bond girl _ in the upcoming 007 feature, ``The World
Is Not Enough.'' Richards plays a nuclear scientist (!) named Dr.
Christmas Jones. Obviously, with a name like that (and with a
figure like Richards'), the actress won't be spending too much time
on screen wearing a lab coat.
</P>
<P>
   Being a Bond girl meant a six-month shoot in England, countless
hours spent doing silly things in front of a blue screen (``Acting
really is a ridiculous job,'' Richards says, again with the laugh)
and the inevitable offer to follow in her predecessors' footsteps
and pose nude for Playboy. Richards declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made a very generous offer, but I didn't even have to
think about it,'' she says. ``It's not like I'm against nudity.
After all, I did that scene for `Wild Things.' And I'm comfortable
with my sexuality. But at the end of the day, Playboy isn't where
I'm at.''
</P>
<P>
   Back to that ``Wild Things'' scene. For those who missed the
movie (it was a bigger hit on video than in theaters), Richards
stripped down to her birthday suit for a steamy menage a trois with
Neve Campbell and Matt Dillon. She knew that by doing it she ran
the risk of being stereotyped, and sure enough, for months after
the movie opened, Richards was deluged with scripts containing
``eight-page lesbian scenes'' and other carnal acts. She passed and
didn't work for nearly a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was hard, but at the same time I'm trying to be a good
actress,'' Richards says, citing Susan Sarandon as a role model.
``I want to have a long career. I'd rather be a great actress than
be a movie star.''
</P>
<P>
   Her patience has been rewarded. Richards was recently cast
opposite Ben Affleck and Luke Wilson in ``The Third Wheel,'' a
romantic comedy from Miramax that recently began filming. Richards
_ surprise _ plays Affleck's dream girl.
</P>
<P>
   She hasn't always been known for glamour. Raised in the suburbs
of Chicago, Richards grew up as a tomboy, playing in the dirt,
eating bugs and hanging out with boys who did the same. Her
favorite Halloween costume speaks volumes: Richards loved dressing
up as a hobo. (Another blow to the princess theory.)
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere around the age of 10, though, a transformation took
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what happened,'' says Richards, who lists her age
as ``20-something,'' with sources putting it around 28. ``One day I
discovered makeup and clothes, and I've never gone back.''
</P>
<P>
   Her father and housewife mother moved the family (Richards has a
younger sister) to Oceanside when Richards was 15. She soon began a
modeling career, landing a YM magazine cover and a print campaign
for Bonnie Bell. She kept it a secret from all but her closest
friends, however, afraid of the teasing that might ensue.
</P>
<P>
   Bored with modeling, she moved to Los Angeles after graduation
and landed parts on ``Doogie Howser, M.D.,'' ``Life Goes On,''
``Seinfeld'' and ``Melrose Place.'' (Richards played Loni
Anderson's daughter, a pretty good bit of ``Melrose'' casting.) She
also made several straight-to-video movies before landing a role in
1997's bugfest ``Starship Troopers.''
</P>
<P>
   She had met ``Starship'' director Paul Verhoeven during an
audition for his sex romp ``Showgirls.'' Fortunately for Richards'
career, Elizabeth Berkley got the part. ``I don't think I could
have done it anyway,'' Richards says.
</P>
<P>
   Most of her roles have revolved around her bombshell beauty, but
Richards brushes her glamorous image off as mostly smoke and
mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people don't realize is all the work that goes into
looking like this,'' Richards says. ``I mean, when I'm on a movie
set, I'm in a trailer for two hours while they fuss with my hair
and makeup. Off the set, I don't think I'm any big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when she's not working, Richards can typically be found
wearing jeans and a T-shirt (sans makeup) and cruising the malls
with her sister (``my best friend,'' Richards says) and boyfriend
Patrick Muldoon (he co-starred with her in ``Starship Troopers'').
She even made a trip _ or three _ out to the cavernous Mall of
America when filming ``Drop Dead Gorgeous'' in Minnesota. (``You
can't go more than 10 feet in any direction without running into a
Gap or Body Shop,'' Richards says.)
</P>
<P>
   Sounds ... nice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved being back in the Midwest,'' Richards says earnestly.
``People are great back there. In Hollywood, if you're polite,
people usually think, `OK. What does she want?' I've had people
say, `You're so nice,' like they were suspicious that I had some
hidden agenda. In the Midwest, nice is nice.'' &QL;

KENNEDY STORY CAUSES DISRUPTION AT NEWSMAGAZINES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the media that mobilized to track the sudden drama off
Martha's Vineyard, the big three newsweeklies _ burdened by weekend
deadlines and a mandate to bring instant context to the
fast-breaking news _ were forced into the most fevered scramble.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. News &AMP; World Report had to tear up 1.8 million magazine
covers and turn back delivery trucks to catch up with the news of
John F. Kennedy Jr.'s missing plane. Newsweek backed up its
deadline by hours and Time magazine managed to turn out an instant
commemorative isue.
</P>
<P>
   These frantic efforts reflected the power of a story that
exploded into public consciousness and riveted the country over the
weekend. Saturday's daylong local television coverage of the
tragedy racked up what one observer called ``unusually high''
viewership for a balmy summer weekend. And Internet chatrooms
exploded with the public's response to a story that once again
proved the headline-grabbing power of Kennedy mystique.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. News, with its early deadline of midnight Friday, got the
go-ahead to remake the magazine on Saturday morning directly from
chairman Mort Zuckerman. Executive editor Brian Duffy assembled
about 50 staffers and in roughly five hours, produced 11 pages on
what the magazine's cover described as ``The Kennedy Curse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When something like this happens, all bets are off,'' said
Duffy. Asked about the cost of remaking the issue, he added:
``We're talking serious six figures. It's serious money.''
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek pushed its deadline from midnight Saturday to about 8
a.m. on Sunday to toss out its original cover plan (described by
spokesman Rory Brunett as a ``soft news cover'') and generate 29
pages dedicated to the Kennedy story. Managing editor Jon Meacham
believes the magazine made news with senior editor Jon Alter's
reporting that Kennedy might have entered New York's 2000
senatorial race had Hillary Rodham Clinton not joined the fray. And
the cover headline, ``Again: A Kennedy Family Tragedy,'' dovetails
with Meacham's assessment that ``you can make a plausible
argument'' that President Kennedy's 1963 assassination ``was the
turning point of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   Time magazine declined to discuss the logistics of putting out
the Kennedy issue, but it did devote 40 of 67 editorial pages to
the subject. Its cover, solemnly labeled a ``Commemorative Issue,''
features a smiling adult Kennedy juxtaposed against an inset photo
of the young ``John John'' saluting his father's casket in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   People magazine recalled half of its staff from a meeting in
Portugal to crank out an edition that will hit the newsstands
Friday and include 41 pages devoted to JFK Jr. The classic People
celebrity subject, Kennedy had appeared on the cover 15 times, and
was the primary focus in eight of those issues, tying him with
Madonna for sixth place among People cover favorites. (The
overwhelming winner, with 50 appearances, was Princess Diana.)
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the clearest indication of the public interest in the
unfolding Kennedy drama were the Saturday ratings of Boston's three
major network affiliates, which provided coverage throughout the
day. From 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., WCVB-Ch. 5, generated a 5.8 rating
and 16 share; WBZ-Ch. 4, had a 5.6/15; and WHDH-Ch. 7 had a 5.7/16.
(One rating point equals 21,000 households. One share point is
equal to 1 percent of the sets in use at a specific time.)
</P>
<P>
   Providing a sense of perspective, Channel 4 spokeswoman Michele
Walsh said those numbers were roughly double the average Saturday
daytime ratings ``unless there's some high-profile sports
programming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For a beautiful day on a Saturday, ratings were unusually
high,'' said Elizabeth Cheng, Channel 5 programming and
communications director.
</P>
<P>
   While the ratings that measure weekend viewership of the cable
news stations _ which usually spike during major news events _ were
not available Monday, there was evidence that another news media
outlet was benefiting by the outpouring of national attention.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic on CNN Web sites jumped from an average of about 9
million page visits to nearly 13 million over the weekend. The
Boston Globe said that as of Monday afternoon, Web site traffic was
21 percent higher than the previous single-day record total, which
was reached during the 1999 Boston Marathon. And the number of
weekend visitors to The Washington Post site jumped by about 36
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Both CNN and the Globe said participation in chatrooms dedicated
to discussions of the Kennedy tragedy were up between 200 percent
and 300 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fund-raisers for both the Republican Party and the
Democratic Party have discovered that invoking the impeachment of
President Clinton still dredges up raw emotions and motivates
Americans to write checks to candidates seeking election in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Even five months after Clinton's trial in the Senate, the
president's impeachment by the House of Representatives remains an
energizing issue that still angers supporters of both parties
enough to make them reach for their checkbooks, they say. Many
donors view their contributions as a way to reward, or punish,
those who led the impeachment drive.
</P>
<P>
   Although the impeachment issue is hardly the only reason for the
record-shattering pace of campaign fund raising, which has given
huge windfalls to both major parties, some fund-raisers and
political analysts say it is still a factor in their election
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has benefited more than the 13 House managers who
prosecuted the president on charges of perjury, obstruction of
justice and abuse of power. Although some of the managers talked
about the political risks of taking on a popular president,
unsolicited checks began pouring into their offices on Capitol Hill
and in their home districts almost as soon as the impeachment
proceedings began. After the trial, the managers formed their own
political action committee and Web site to collect money for their
re-election campaigns (www.housemanagers2000.org).
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most hotly contested House races, Rep. James
Rogan, R-Calif., who was one of the most outspoken House managers,
raised more than $1 million in just six months, a sum that
political strategists said was extremely high for a freshman House
member who was not a party leader. Rogan's contributor base has
skyrocketed, from 3,000 two years ago to 20,000 today. A majority
of his contributions have come from people who say they admire his
``courage'' in prosecuting the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``God Bless you for fighting for what's right with America and
for principled individuals to serve it,'' Katie Cook of Laguna
Hills, Calif., wrote to Rogan in a letter this month that included
a $25 check.
</P>
<P>
   But Rogan's opponent, Sen. Adam Schiff, has raised more than
$500,000 from Democrats, and many of them have told fund-raisers
they want to punish Rogan for serving as a House manager. The
$500,000 Schiff has raised ``is an enormous amount for a
challenger,'' said Erik Smith, a spokesman for the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee. ``I can't think of another
challenger who ever raised that much money so quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogan's active role in the Senate trial motivated David Geffen,
one of the founders of the Dreamworks SKG film studio, to play host
to a fund-raiser for Schiff on June 23 on the Dreamworks campus in
Glendale, Calif. The event raised $120,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Rogan is a bad guy, and we're going to do everything
we can to see that he loses,'' Geffen said. ``James Rogan sort of
marketed himself as a moderate when he ran for that election. The
impeachment hearings made it very clear that he is certainly not a
moderate, and he is as extreme as anybody else in Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Republicans' pro-impeachment fund raising was fueled
by a statement attributed to Clinton in an article published in The
New York Times one day after the Senate trial concluded on Feb. 12.
The article said that the president intended to seek revenge
against the House managers who had prosecuted him in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based just on that story, we got at least 1,000 unsolicited
checks, from small donors, the $5, $10 and $20 donors,'' said Greg
Mitchell, Rogan's chief of staff. ``We got a direct-mail vendor,
and we did a test-mailing of our own, and the response was big.''
Mitchell said the campaign used mailing lists from the Heritage
Foundation, a conservative group, and weekly edition of The
Washington Times.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Rogan, most of the other Republican managers have seats
that are considered relatively safe. But another manager who is
considered politically vulnerable is Steve Chabot, R-Ohio. Chabot
has raised about $335,000 in the first six months of this year,
about five times the amount he raised in the comparable period in
1997, according to Federal Election Commission records.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say they think Chabot and Rogan are particularly
vulnerable because they were elected in November 1998 with less
than 55 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Another House manager, Bill McCollum, R-Fla., is using the
impeachment issue to fuel fund raising for a Senate bid. In a
fund-raising letter that his campaign aides say has attracted a
strong response, McCollum wrote, ``the same forces that sought to
undermine the rule of law are now seeking revenge against me as a
result of my role as one of the impeachment House managers.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   For many years, fund-raisers have invoked enemies to drum up
donations. In the 1980s, Republican fund-raisers often cited Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., in their mailings. Democrats denounced
conservative Supreme Court nominees like Robert Bork in their
appeals for money.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Clinton have routinely mentioned the five-year-old
investigation by Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel,
in pitches for money to pay the $10 million that the Clintons owe
their lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   And Republicans of late have raised tens of thousands of dollars
from conservatives by invoking Hillary Rodham Clinton's
all-but-certain Senate candidacy in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But the impeachment debate was such a deeply divisive issue that
its memory is still fresh in the minds of most politically active
people.
</P>
<P>
   In numerous fund-raising letters sent by Democrats, the rallying
cry is to eliminate the slim Republican majority in the House of
Representatives. Almost always, Clinton's impeachment is mentioned,
though sometimes in a veiled way.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent in April, Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the House
minority leader, wrote: ``As you just witnessed with the
Republican-led impeachment proceedings, the GOP ignored the will of
the people to serve their own extremist agenda. With impeachment
behind them, they have turned their sights to the budget surplus,
where they are fighting to get tax cuts to the rich instead of
President Clinton's plan to use the surplus to save Social
Security.''
</P>
<P>
   The pitches are working. The Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee, which supports the party's House candidates, has raised
a record $17 million in the first six months of 1999, a 150 percent
increase from the total raised in the comparable period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A card the committee sent in April also invoked impeachment and
the phrase coined by Clinton and other Democrats, ``the politics of
personal destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``During the impeachment debate,'' the card said, ``Democrats in
the House, led by Democratic leader Richard Gephardt, fought
vigorously to defend the Constitution and to bring an end to the
politics of personal destruction. Their stalwart defense of
democratic principles is deserving to support from DCCC members all
across the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   And in a fund-raising letter on behalf of Schiff, Sen. Barbara
Boxer, D-Calif., dropped former Speaker Newt Gingrich's name,
saying that Rogan was ``handpicked by then-Speaker Newt Gingrich to
organize the impeachment effort.''
</P>
<P>
   The use of impeachment by both sides surprised Floyd Brown, who
runs Citizens United, a conservative action group and a prolific
fund-raiser. ``No. 1, Republicans lost, and when you lose, you
don't want to keep bringing up the fact that you lost, over and
over again,'' Brown said. ``The Democrats, while they won, it's a
very risky strategy to bring up with a broader audience except the
hard-core Democratic audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he thought that ``Clinton fatigue'' was driving much
of the record amounts that have gone to the presidential campaign
of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and other Republican and
conservative causes. ``Whoever is the Republican nominee is not
going to have any money problems _ they can back up the dump
truck,'' Brown said. ``Conservatives are going to express their
Clinton fatigue with dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rogan has derided Geffen's active role in the campaign in
his fund-raising letters, calling him a member of ``Hollywood's
liberal power elite.''
</P>
<P>
   More than one-third of the checks given to Rogan have come from
outside of California, his aides said. ``People respect Jim Rogan
for standing up for what he believed was right and risking his
political future for what he believes is right,'' said Mitchell,
Rogan's chief of staff. ``A lot of people were writing to us saying
they don't think there are many people in politics like that any
more. Most politicians won't take risks. They'll just do whatever
they can to save their seat in Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   One supporter, Eileen P. Roth of Burbank, Calif., vowed to send
$25 every month until the election in November 2000. In a
hand-written letter, Mrs. Roth told Rogan, ``I wish we had many
millions just like you in our beloved America.''

   Picture a research collaboration between  &UR; Bob Dole &LR;  and  &UR; Martha &LR; 
 &UR; Stewart &LR; . Researchers at Bar-Ilan University in Israel have
determined that Viagra will help double the life span of plants,
fruit and vegetables. ``Plants aren't all that different from
people,'' said plant physiologist Yaacov Leshem. Viagra ``helps
prevent aging and helps them stay erect.''
</P>
<P>
   A few drops of Viagra dissolved in water helps to cut the
emission of ethylene from cut flowers. It's ethylene that causes
ripening and eventual spoilage. Leshem says the only drawback is
the cost of Viagra, and, oh, the possible effects on consumers who
eat vegetables treated with the stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could certainly affect impotency ...'' said Leshem, and
``also have a negative influence on elderly people if they have
health complications. Our recommendation for the time being is that
Viagra only be safely applied to cut flowers. People don't tend to
eat roses.''

<P>
   MOSCOW _ It rained in Moscow on Monday, an event not normally
regarded as international news but which, in this parboiled Russian
summer, has occurred roughly as often as men bite dogs.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the showers have doused a heat wave so searing that it
apparently provoked at least one Russian husband to kill his wife,
spurred clouds of locusts to devour Russian crops and set afire not
only Russian forests, but the very ground as well.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow had never in memory seen a June like the one just passed,
the hottest since records were first kept 120 years ago and the
driest since 1956. July has been little better. In the six weeks
since the heat wave began, on June 5, high temperatures have soared
each day past the usual 75 or so to the high 80s and even to the
mid-90s, unheard of for a city only 750 miles from the Arctic
Circle.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the rest of Russia has suffered more brutally. The heat
and drought have helped to produce a plague of ravenous locusts in
southwestern Siberia, where several hundred square miles of crops
have been damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, more than 20,000 fires have raged so far
this summer, 4,000 more than last year. Nearly 900 fires were
burning last weekend across 1,750 square miles of forest, and
federal authorities counted 195 new fires on Sunday alone, largely
in remote southern Siberia, southwest Russia near the Georgia
border and the Vologda region northeast of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Fires forced President Boris Yeltsin to leave his country home
last week in Zavidovo, 75 miles north of Moscow, for a dacha closer
to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   But even in Moscow, 115 fires were burning over the weekend,
though many may have been doused by Monday's steady rains.
</P>
<P>
   About 10,000 firefighters and 75 aircraft have been sent to put
out forest fires, but officials say more of both are needed.
</P>
<P>
   In an emergency conference with regional officials on Friday,
the director of Russia's Federal Forestry Service, Valery Shubin,
said the situation was rapidly deteriorating, in part because the
government lacked the $190,000 a day it estimated was needed to
battle the blazes.
</P>
<P>
   The entire amount set aside by the treasury to fight forest
fires ``works out at being enough to buy 2.5 helicopters for the
whole of Russia,'' he said. ``That's the total investment. The
situation is getting worse and worse, and is close to getting out
of control.''
</P>
<P>
   In some places, including Moscow's suburbs, the hot, dry stretch
has literally set the ground afire, causing spontaneous combustion
in hundreds of peat bogs here and elsewhere in European Russia.
Before Sunday's rains, parts of Moscow were becoming fogged by a
peaty-smelling haze, and medical authorities were warning people
with breathing problems either to stay indoors or to head to their
dachas outside town.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens if the ground temperature remains above 50
degrees'' _ 122 degrees Fahrenheit _ ``for more than 10 or 12
days,'' Roman M. Vilfand, the deputy director of the Federal
Hydrometeorological Service, said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety degrees may not sound like much in places like the United
States, where a normal summer day may harbor mid-90s heat and
stifling humidity. But most of Russia is acclimated to weather as
cold as 10 degrees below 0, not 85 above.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, a teeming capital not known for leafy glades or
fountained plazas, air-conditioning is a luxury reserved largely
for upscale stores and government office buildings. Fewer than
one-seventh of public buildings are air-cooled, according to the
popular weekly Argumenty i Fakty, which added acerbically that the
offices in Moscow's city hall are so cool that some workers shiver
in their shirt-sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   Many food markets have modernized in the last few years by
installing banks of refrigerated display cases, which keep beer and
soft drinks chilly _ but only by spewing hot exhaust into the
aisles. By law, the government has decreed a minimum indoor
temperature for all buildings, but no maximum, an oversight no one
seemed to notice until this year.
</P>
<P>
   The heat wave may be nearing an end, at least in Moscow, said
Galina A. Maksimova, a department director at the city's
meteorological bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do expect rains at the end of July and the beginning of
August, and our calculations show the weather isn't likely to bring
us the surprises we've had so far,'' she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For some, however, the break comes too late. The daily Moskovsky
Komsomolets reported early this month that one man, driven to
distraction by his wife's demands for an air conditioner, stuck her
hand into the blades of a whirring fan in their sauna-like
apartment, then hit her over the head with a stool and stuffed her
body into the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously,'' the newspaper stated, ``she didn't expect such a
cool reaction to her request.''

OFF-DAY ATTENTION TURNS TO POSSIBLE DRUG USE

   TARBES, France _ There was no racing in the Tour de France
Monday as the bicyclists were given a day off before their ascent
into the Pyrenees mountains Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   So what was the topic du jour? Drugs, of course.
</P>
<P>
   A Belgian rider was thrown out by his team after he admitted to
using medication without having notified his team. And American
Lance Armstrong addressed the press about his dominant seven-minute
lead and to answer charges that it might be drug-induced.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last week has been a little disturbing with innuendo and
speculation in the press, and I only ask to be treated fairly. If
you have a question, just ask,'' said Armstrong. He has never
tested positive, but some in the French press have indicated that
his performance is supernatural.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I do?'' he said. ``I can only assert my innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Ludi Dierckxsens, who won a stage last week
and tested negative atferward, was sent home after admitting to
taking corticoid to treat tendinitis. Even though he had a
prescription for the medication, the no-tolerance position that
many teams have taken after last year's drug controvery resulted in
his ouster.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, acknowledging that he didn't know all the details of
the Belgian case, said it was difficult ``to have a point of view
since corticoids can be performance-enhancing or be used as cures,
in case of knee problems, for instance.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, who was diagnosed with testicular cancer in October
1996, underwent chemotherapy and said he last took medication on
Dec. 13, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the press coverage about him has detracted from his
racing, Armstrong nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it has taken away from where I've gotten so far,''
he said. ``But I also know there's a big story after last year and
the Tour of Italy (when leader Marco Pantani was banned after
testing positive).
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I do? I can only assert my innocence, tell people
that I've been on a deathbed, and I'm not stupid. But sure, it's
disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   He also reminded people that he has chosen to live and race in a
country that now has strict sanctions against drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live in France, I race all year in France, I did my Tour de
France preparation and my training camp in France,'' he said. ``If
I had something to hide, I think I would stay away from France.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The rest day wasn't restful for everybody. ``A day off? What's
that?'' said Geoff Brown, one of the US Postal Service team's three
mechanics. He was in the parking lot of the team hotel, tending to
the team bikes that had been just used on training rides. He was
sponging them down, gluing on new tires, putting on new chains, and
adding gears that are suited for Tuesday's first race on the
Pyrenees. The riders arrive at the Tour with three bikes _ one for
road racing, one spare, and one for the trials. Plus, they have a
slew of spare parts such as extra forks and frames that are stashed
in the team's truck. ``It's like a bike shop on wheels, actually,''
said Brown . . . After the ride in the shadow of the Pyrenees, the
riders had lunch, massages, and took a nap. In between rider Tyler
Hamilton also got treated by a chiropractor for his sore back and
hips that have been bothering him since his two crashes . . . A
taste of home: Frankie Andreau of the US Postal Service team is
getting to know just how many people are reading the daily diary he
writes for Velo News magazine. He recently wrote that the team
couldn't find any peanut butter in the local stores, and viola!
Jars of the American delight were FedExed to the team.

KENNEDY STORY CAUSES DISRUPTION AT NEWSMAGAZINES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the media that mobilized to track the sudden drama off
Martha's Vineyard, the big three newsweeklies _ burdened by weekend
deadlines and a mandate to bring instant context to the
fast-breaking news _ were forced into the most fevered scramble.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. News &AMP; World Report had to tear up 1.8 million magazine
covers and turn back delivery trucks to catch up with the news of
John F. Kennedy Jr.'s missing plane. Newsweek backed up its
deadline by hours and Time magazine managed to turn out an instant
commemorative isue.
</P>
<P>
   These frantic efforts reflected the power of a story that
exploded into public consciousness and riveted the country over the
weekend. Saturday's daylong local television coverage of the
tragedy racked up what one observer called ``unusually high''
viewership for a balmy summer weekend. And Internet chatrooms
exploded with the public's response to a story that once again
proved the headline-grabbing power of Kennedy mystique.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. News, with its early deadline of midnight Friday, got the
go-ahead to remake the magazine on Saturday morning directly from
chairman Mort Zuckerman. Executive editor Brian Duffy assembled
about 50 staffers and in roughly five hours, produced 11 pages on
what the magazine's cover described as ``The Kennedy Curse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When something like this happens, all bets are off,'' said
Duffy. Asked about the cost of remaking the issue, he added:
``We're talking serious six figures. It's serious money.''
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek pushed its deadline from midnight Saturday to about 8
a.m. on Sunday to toss out its original cover plan (described by
spokesman Rory Brunett as a ``soft news cover'') and generate 29
pages dedicated to the Kennedy story. Managing editor Jon Meacham
believes the magazine made news with senior editor Jon Alter's
reporting that Kennedy might have entered New York's 2000
senatorial race had Hillary Rodham Clinton not joined the fray. And
the cover headline, ``Again: A Kennedy Family Tragedy,'' dovetails
with Meacham's assessment that ``you can make a plausible
argument'' that President Kennedy's 1963 assassination ``was the
turning point of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   Time magazine declined to discuss the logistics of putting out
the Kennedy issue, but it did devote 40 of 67 editorial pages to
the subject. Its cover, solemnly labeled a ``Commemorative Issue,''
features a smiling adult Kennedy juxtaposed against an inset photo
of the young ``John John'' saluting his father's casket in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   People magazine recalled half of its staff from a meeting in
Portugal to crank out an edition that will hit the newsstands
Friday and include 41 pages devoted to JFK Jr. The classic People
celebrity subject, Kennedy had appeared on the cover 15 times, and
was the primary focus in eight of those issues, tying him with
Madonna for sixth place among People cover favorites. (The
overwhelming winner, with 50 appearances, was Princess Diana.)
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the clearest indication of the public interest in the
unfolding Kennedy drama were the Saturday ratings of Boston's three
major network affiliates, which provided coverage throughout the
day. From 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., WCVB-Ch. 5, generated a 5.8 rating
and 16 share; WBZ-Ch. 4, had a 5.6/15; and WHDH-Ch. 7 had a 5.7/16.
(One rating point equals 21,000 households. One share point is
equal to 1 percent of the sets in use at a specific time.)
</P>
<P>
   Providing a sense of perspective, Channel 4 spokeswoman Michele
Walsh said those numbers were roughly double the average Saturday
daytime ratings ``unless there's some high-profile sports
programming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For a beautiful day on a Saturday, ratings were unusually
high,'' said Elizabeth Cheng, Channel 5 programming and
communications director.
</P>
<P>
   While the ratings that measure weekend viewership of the cable
news stations _ which usually spike during major news events _ were
not available Monday, there was evidence that another news media
outlet was benefiting by the outpouring of national attention.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic on CNN Web sites jumped from an average of about 9
million page visits to nearly 13 million over the weekend. The
Boston Globe said that as of Monday afternoon, Web site traffic was
21 percent higher than the previous single-day record total, which
was reached during the 1999 Boston Marathon. And the number of
weekend visitors to The Washington Post site jumped by about 36
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Both CNN and the Globe said participation in chatrooms dedicated
to discussions of the Kennedy tragedy were up between 200 percent
and 300 percent.

   KENNEDY-EUROPE (London) _ He was the custodian of a family's
curse, a patrician dynasty's tragic prince whose pride _ even
arrogance _ led to his downfall. He was a reckless adventurer,
seized with a death wish that played itself out in the hazy skies
off Martha's Vineyard. With front-page headlines and assessments
like those, European newspapers from the tabloid Sun in Britain to
the ponderous Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung in Germany delivered
their verdicts today on the disappearance of John F. Kennedy Jr.,
part of the frenzy of coverage that led the German paper to lament,
``The global infotainment industry has its raw material _ the curse
of the Kennedys.'' By Alan Cowell.
</P>

was discussing with advisers strategic options. In particular, the
executive said, Kennedy had hoped to find a financial partner and

LET'S PURCHASE LAND TO CREATE MAINE WOODS NATIONAL PARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is
levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.)  
(gm) 
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   
 c.1999 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a movement afoot to create a 3.2-million-acre national
park in Maine that extends from Umsaskis Lake and Priestly Mountain
in the north to Sebec Lake and Monson Pond in the south. The
western-most boundary is Quebec Province, Canada and Green Mountain
to the east. The proposed national park lies about 40 miles north
of Bangor.
</P>
<P>
   The Baxter State Park will be entirely surrounded by the
proposed national park, but it will remain a state-run park. In
1919, former Maine Rep. and later Gov. Percival Baxter attempted to
secure state protection for the Mt. Katahdin area. He was
unsuccessful. So, he purchased the land with his own money and
donated it to the people of the state of Maine as the ``forever
wild'' state park.
</P>
<P>
   Conservationists from around the nation see this as a last
chance to save the famed North Woods. Jym St. Pierre, the Maine
director of RESTORE: The North Woods, the regional conservation
group which has proposed creating the national park, wrote
recently, ``Establishing a Maine Woods National Park would
safeguard a national treasure where the haunting yodel of loons
echoes through the warm, blue summer air. It would give us an
opportunity to restore the legendary forests of Maine, the song of
the wolf, the splash of the Atlantic salmon, the magic of caribou
gliding through wild woods like massive, mysterious shadows. It
would be a magnificent people's park for the Twenty-first Century
and a fitting millennial memorial for future generations.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Pierre isn't the first person to wax poetic about this area,
Henry David Thoreau, after his visit in 1853, declared that it
should be saved as a national preserve. Thoreau, in his book ``The
Maine Woods,'' a profound study of woods and camping, wrote: ``From
this elevation, just on the skirts of the clouds, we could overlook
the country, west and south, for a hundred miles. There it was, the
State of Maine ... immeasurable forest for the sun to shine on ...
No clearing, no house.
</P>
<P>
   ``It did not look as if a solitary traveler had cut so much as a
walking stick there. Countless lakes ... and mountains also, whose
names, for the most part, are known only to the Indians. The forest
looks like a firm grass sward, and the effect of these lakes ... is
that of a mirror broken into a thousand fragments, and wildly
scattered over the grass, reflecting the full blaze of the sun.''
</P>
<P>
   At present, there is a great opportunity to purchase some of the
land necessary to create this national park. Approximately 5
percent of Maine is currently up for sale. Two major paper
companies, Sappi Ltd. and Bowater Inc., are offering to sell nearly
three million acres of forest land, which constitutes 17 percent of
the forested area in Maine. A number of state conservation groups
are attempting to arrange a package to buy Sappi land.
</P>
<P>
   Those who wish to preserve these lands as a national park have
to overcome the reluctance of politicians and local residents who
see the timber industry as the backbone of Maine's economy. And
there are those who fear that if this stretch of land becomes a
national park, they won't be able to hunt or fish or use
snowmobiles in the park. They worry that they will lose access to
the land.
</P>
<P>
   The tourists who are attracted to Maine now will increase
tenfold if this national park is created. And nearby towns will
reap greater economic benefit from the park than they have from the
timber industry.
</P>
<P>
   The people of America hunger for more wilderness and greater
tracks of land that preserve nature: the wildlife, the streams and
rivers, the forests and undergrowth, the deep silence and sense of
connection to the earth we need to escape the pressures of work and
the busyness of life.
</P>
<P>
   Many years ago, former U.S. Supreme Court Justice William O.
Douglas wrote, ``Nature must be left undisturbed in ever-widening
circles, so that she can heal the wounds of civilization and
re-create the wonders of God's wilderness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Heal the wounds of civilization.'' Yes. How often we seek the
solace of the wilderness. The wonder of a massive, 750-year-old
Sitka spruce on the Oregon coast that has survived numerous
lightning strikes _ yet bares their scars in deep, jagged cuts
through its bark. The quiet that the deep foliage brings, the red
of rotting tree trunks, the green canopy of leaves, the light
shimmering green to complement the red wood slowly turning to soil.
</P>
<P>
   Who among us has never felt the sanctity of the wilderness? Who
has not felt cleansed by walking through a forest hearing the wind
sing through the branches and leaves, the pines and firs? Or
cleansed by lying down beside a river so the purling waters hush
the din of civilization we carry within ourselves?
</P>
<P>
   Now is the time to secure the great North Woods of Maine. The
Maine Woods National Park would rival the Yellowstone National
Park, which so many of us cherish. The nation's economy has created
a windfall of taxes for the federal government. And here is a
worthy investment for this nation's future _ purchase the land
necessary to make the proposed Maine Woods National Park a reality.
</P>
<P>
   There is no better way to spend a small portion of the nation's
tax dollars. The entire purchase will cost less than we taxpayers
pay for a B-2 bomber. And one never has to worry about a wilderness
area becoming obsolete.

DEL MAR TO OPEN WITH NEW DIRT SURFACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART WILSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thoroughbred owners and trainers will have a new dirt surface to
check out Thursday when Del Mar opens its doors for another summer
of racing.
</P>
<P>
   Many owners and trainers have complained in past years about Del
Mar's main track, claiming it was too deep and caused horses to
break down.
</P>
<P>
   Owners Ed and Marge Goldstein, who race Margeds Dancer and
Margeds Ditto at Santa Anita and Hollywood Park, refuse to bring
their horses south. They claim too many horses are injured at Del
Mar.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort perhaps to appease disgruntled horsemen, Del Mar
spent $600,000 to rebuild its main track during the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   In a job that took approximately four months to complete, work
crews removed the track's cushion and went down 15 inches to the
sub-base, which was treated with lime, stabilized and compacted.
Six inches of manufactured sand was placed on the new sub-base,
followed by a two-inch layer of clay and sand.
</P>
<P>
   The new cushion was then added on top, including 4,000 tons of
Gillebrand sand -- the extra fine substance that is used to help
lower the track's silt and clay content.
</P>
<P>
   Del Mar's barn area also underwent renovations as part of a $2.5
million overall improvement project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our horsemen will like what they see when they come to Del Mar
this summer,'' Del Mar Turf Club president and general manager Joe
Harper said. ``The new track will be kind to their horses, and the
backstretch upgrades should make life quite a bit more pleasant for
both horses and help.''
</P>
<P>
   While improvement to the dirt oval is appreciated by veteran
trainer Mel Stute, the Glendora resident has never had a major
problem with Del Mar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago, it was always awful deep the first week,'' said the
71-year-old Stute, who has been bringing horses to Del Mar for
nearly 50 years. ``I remember one year I went down there and I
bowed four horses in the first three days I was there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I go, and I usually don't breeze them for a week or so
down there until the track tightens up a little.''
</P>
<P>
   Said racing secretary Tom Knust: ``The new racetrack is going to
draw a very positive response. All reports back so far have been
very good. The track is going to be kind to our horses, and there's
a lot of expertise that has gone into getting it just right.''
</P>
<P>
   Stute's older brother, Warren Stute of Arcadia, scoffs at
suggestions that Del Mar's surface is worse than any other track's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm like Mel, when it's deep I don't like it,'' said Stute,
who is 77 and has been saddling horses at Del Mar since the early
1940s. ``But it tightens up after a while, so I don't have that
much trouble with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Horsemen complain about any track. I don't care where it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Del Mar's 42-day season, highlighted by the $1 million Pacific
Classic on Sunday, Aug. 29, will run through Wednesday, Sept. 8.
</P>
<P>
   -- Oak Tree at Santa Anita, which will celebrate its 30th
anniversary this fall, has announced a $5-million, 29-event stakes
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting begins on Sept. 29 and runs through Nov. 8.
</P>
<P>
   One of Oak Tree's major races, the $500,000 Grade I Yellow
Ribbon Stakes for older fillies and mares on the grass, has been
moved from the final weekend of the meet to the opening weekend as
a result of the new Breeders' Cup Filly and Mare turf race.
</P>
<P>
   The Yellow Ribbon will be run on Saturday, Oct. 2, so the
world's top female grass specialists can run in both races.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Breeders' Cup will be held on Saturday, Nov. 6, at
Gulfstream Park in Hallandale, Fla.

<P>
   History has been stingy up to now with Fani Uveda, the woman who
was the faithful shadow of Jorge Luis Borges for 35 years. Few have
remembered Fani in the celebration of the centenary of Borges'
birthday, which ends on Aug. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Is it worth it to know anything about her? Unlike many literary
assistants, Fani was excluded from Borges' writing endeavors. Her
realm was to worry about Borges' physical health and his dreams. In
itself, that is probably more than is usually allowed a domestic
employee. Fani has not been mentioned in the encyclopedias of
literature. Today her poverty is distressing; she has known only
degradation and oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   By way of contrast, Percy Adlon, the Bavarian director of
``Bagdad Cafe,'' in 1981, dedicated the first and maybe the best of
his films, ``Celeste,'' to Proust's maid. In 1973, Celeste Albaret
dictated her memoirs to journalist Georges Belmont, which later
were published in a book under her name, titled ``Monsieur
Proust.''
</P>
<P>
   By then, she was the official guide at the Proust Museum, in the
old house of Maurice Ravel, and whatever money she received from
the book gave her a comfortable and peaceful old age.
</P>
<P>
   I visited Fani earlier this month (July), in the two-story house
lent to her by Alejandro Baccaro, one of Borges' biographers. Every
photograph on the first floor was part of a tribute to the Boca
Juniors, Argentina's wildly popular championship soccer team.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing could be further from Borges' taste than Baccaro's loud
gold-and-blue wastebaskets _ Boca's team colors _ and the photos of
top soccer players in past championships. So too, it was strange to
think of Borges amid the many bound volumes of the sports daily El
Clarin, which covered the floor, were piled up as a base for the TV
set and decorated a conference room.
</P>
<P>
   When she received me, Fani sat, with a severe expression, at an
old desk. She is a strong country woman, resolute, and never
willing to complain of her bad fortune. She speaks about herself in
a monotonous voice, frequently confusing genders. She tells, for
example, of the night Borges married Elsa Astete Millan, in 1967,
and he decided to sleep alone in his bed. She accompanied ``him''
(Elsa) to the subway. That night, Borges dreamed of two
dark-skinned women, as ethereal as smoke, who took him by the neck
and tried to suffocate him.
</P>
<P>
   Fani kept on talking, imperturbable, and more than once it was
necessary to stop and ask her to explain what she meant.
</P>
<P>
   Her story is well known in Buenos Aires: she arrived at Leonor
Acevedo de Borges' flat, on Maipu Street, soon after Evita Peron's
death and, as in the case of Celeste, she thought she would be
staying only for a few weeks. The cook's sickness put her, almost
at once, at the helm. She handled everything, from buying food to
reading aloud to Borges the contracts sent by editors.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Proud's maid, she never took dictation for poems or short
stories, and she acted surprised when I asked if she did. She had
different tasks, she said: ``What I handled there was life
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   More than once, Borges woke her up to tell her his more
distressing dreams. Sometimes he envisioned midgets under his bed;
other times he imagined himself endlessly traveling on very crowded
trains, holding the handrails. Almost always, though, it was the
``smoke women'' who entered his dreams and carried him away.
</P>
<P>
   With ernest concern, Fani suggested that he should count sheep.
Borges followed her simple advice, but the lambs rebelled and
turned into monsters whose names Fani could never decipher:
basilisks, hippogryphs, dragons.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to move Fani's tale from the moment she was thrown
out of Borges' house, at a time when the writer had been sick for
some time in Geneva and two months before he died. She kept
returning obsessively to that moment. Evidently, for a while, she
worked as a maid in an apartment upstairs in the same building.
This allowed her to water Borges' flowers _ or hers _ leaning from
the balcony. But then, after a while, she had to leave.
Empty-handed, Fani found shelter in a hut in Burzaco. It was there
she learned of Borges' death.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again she has asked herself how his death had been,
how it was when he walked into the darkness of the other side, that
darkness of which he had so often spoken to her.
</P>
<P>
   Celeste Albaret, instead, never stopped being Proust's
confident. In her memoirs she tells of a night of dreadful sickness
when, taking her by the hands, the writer told her: ``And to think
it will be these fingers that will close my eyes!'' At 2 a.m., Nov.
18, 1922, hours before his death, Proust called Celeste so they
could work together.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can survive the night,'' he said, ``I'll show the doctors
I'm stronger than they are. But to do that, I have to last till
morning. Do you think I will make it, Celeste?'' Close to 3:30
a.m., seeing the maid's hand was almost rigid because of the cold,
Proust said: ``Let's leave it, Celeste. I'm very tired. I can't do
anything more. But stay by my side, please.''
</P>
<P>
   Fani didn't seem to understand this story. She could only return
to her own past.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would have happened if you had stayed in the house, Fani?
What would you have done?'' All she said was that she'd have taken
Borges to the bathtub, as always, and left him in silence for an
hour, or maybe more, and returned to warm the water once in a while
for him because ``while he was in the bathtub, he always found the
best words.''
</P>
<P>
   Maids have been lethal in the world of politics, but more than
once they have saved writers from the loneliness of literature.

   History has been stingy up to now with Fani Uveda, the woman who
was the faithful shadow of Jorge Luis Borges for 35 years. Few have
remembered Fani in the celebration of the centenary of Borges'
birthday, which ends on Aug. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Is it worth it to know anything about her? Unlike many literary
assistants, Fani was excluded from Borges' writing endeavors. Her
realm was to worry about Borges' physical health and his dreams. In
itself, that is probably more than is usually allowed a domestic
employee. Fani has not been mentioned in the encyclopedias of
literature. Today her poverty is distressing; she has known only
degradation and oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   By way of contrast, Percy Adlon, the Bavarian director of
``Bagdad Cafe,'' in 1981, dedicated the first and maybe the best of
his films, ``Celeste,'' to Proust's maid. In 1973, Celeste Albaret
dictated her memoirs to journalist Georges Belmont, which later
were published in a book under her name, titled ``Monsieur
Proust.''
</P>
<P>
   By then, she was the official guide at the Proust Museum, in the
old house of Maurice Ravel, and whatever money she received from
the book gave her a comfortable and peaceful old age.
</P>
<P>
   I visited Fani earlier this month (July), in the two-story house
lent to her by Alejandro Baccaro, one of Borges' biographers. Every
photograph on the first floor was part of a tribute to the Boca
Juniors, Argentina's wildly popular championship soccer team.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing could be further from Borges' taste than Baccaro's loud
gold-and-blue wastebaskets _ Boca's team colors _ and the photos of
top soccer players in past championships. So too, it was strange to
think of Borges amid the many bound volumes of the sports daily El
Clarin, which covered the floor, were piled up as a base for the TV
set and decorated a conference room.

 &HT;    GOP hopefuls set their sights on Atlanta
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta-Iowa circuit has been very active of late.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, Republican presidential candidates Gary Bauer and
Elizabeth Dole made whistle-stops here on their way to the Great
Plains. The Friday before, Steve Forbes announced his Georgia
campaign team at the Capitol before heading back to the relentless
struggle for the hearts and minds of Iowans who have a ticket to
next month's Republican straw poll in Ames.
</P>
<P>
   This flurry of summertime campaign activity is a small token of
Georgia's importance in the 2000 presidential nomination process.
More than anything else, however, it's a sign of how fast this
campaign is speeding by.
</P>
<P>
   Already, before either touched ground in this state, one
Republican candidate, Ohio Rep. John Kasich, has dropped out, and
another, Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire, has switched parties.
</P>
<P>
   In the new scheme of things, these aren't really early campaign
stops. Instead, they represent an effort to shoehorn in some
presence in Georgia before the perceived necessity to do well in
symbolic events like the Aug. 14 Iowa straw poll takes full control
of the candidates' time.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question, if you're voting on March 7, your voices will be
heard,'' Dole said last week, sounding an upbeat note about the
impact Georgia might have.
</P>
<P>
   What she didn't say was that Californians, New Yorkers and
voters in a slough of other states will be making their voices
heard on the same day, and that so much will have transpired by
then, the gigantic primary day may be a moot point.
</P>
<P>
   Hurried into stumping here before the campaign has really taken
shape, the candidates had to be innovative in their appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Dole used Atlanta's Fulton County Library as a backdrop to
propose tougher federal laws to make it harder to access Internet
porno sites on library computers _ something a lot of Republicans
would approve of, but also a sign of how tough it is these days to
stake out new territory in the field of family values. Bauer went
to Fort McPherson to advocate more federal spending for defense.
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, all the GOP candidates will find a way through the
crowded calendar to get back to Georgia when the campaign takes on
a sharper focus. Because while it may have no special importance as
an early state, this is where the issues are.
</P>
<P>
   There's no better place to debate the Patient's Bill of Rights _
which the Republicans must ultimately confront in a more searching
way than the Senate did last week _ than the home of Rep. Charlie
Norwood, one of its originators.
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek last week called the North Atlanta suburbs ``the
frontline of the great lifestyle struggle of the next century.''
That's true not only because the traffic's a mess, as it is in so
many places, but because the unprecedented growth around Atlanta is
a factor of the prosperity that much of the nation has enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   The general election will in large part be a discussion about
the related issues of who'll be blamed for the traffic _ along with
environmental degradation and other growing problems of the coming
century _ and who'll get credit for the prosperity. If the
Republicans want a jump-start on that debate, they can begin it
here.

SATELLITE OBSERVATORY TO EXPAND KNOWLEDGE OF UNIVERSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ A new satellite observatory called Chandra,
poised for a launch aboard the space shuttle Columbia early Tuesday
morning, is expected to do for the violent, mysterious world of
X-ray astronomy what the Hubble telescope did for the visible sky:
open up a new universe of discoveries by lofting its unprecedented
power far above Earth's soupy atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   And in a significant first, the $2.7 billion project was
designed and managed, and will be controlled throughout its
lifetime of at least five years in orbit, by scientists and
engineers at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in
Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   The actual control and testing of the satellite will be managed
at a new control center, while the processing of all the data that
will be sent back from the observatory, and the evaluation and
scheduling of requests for observing time from astronomers around
the world, will take place at a new science center at the Harvard
Observatory.
</P>
<P>
   After more than a decade of work to design and oversee
construction of the 45-foot long, 5-ton spacecraft, activity among
the Chandra team in Cambridge, and at Cape Canaveral for the
launch, was at a fever pitch as the long-awaited takeoff _ delayed
since last summer by a series of technical problems _ finally drew
near. The project has been in the works since the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long road,'' said Chandra program manager Fred S.
Wojtalik. The Chandra telescope, named in honor of India-born
astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, is ``the baby of quite a
few people who have devoted significant parts of a lifetime to
making this happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle Columbia was to roar into orbit at 12:36 a.m. with
Eileen Collins at the controls, the first woman astronaut named
commander of a shuttle mission. Collins, who will be flying with
the heaviest, most expensive cargo ever carried by the shuttle (at
least, in unclassified flights), has flown twice before as pilot,
the No. 2 position.
</P>
<P>
   This morning, about seven hours after liftoff, a delicate series
of maneuvers will begin positioning the tractor-trailer-sized
telescope for release from the shuttle's payload bay. After
release, as soon as radio communication with the spacecraft is
established, control of the observatory will shift from Houston to
Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   The telescope will go through some last-minute tests, and then
late Wednesday it will be launched into a higher, oval orbit by
firing its attached rocket motor.
</P>
<P>
   Once in its higher orbit _ which will reach out as far as 87,000
miles above Earth, or a third of the way to the moon, at its
highest point _ the telescope will be out of reach of astronauts.
Even at the low point in its 64-hour orbit, Chandra will be 6,200
miles high _ more than 20 times the shuttle's maximum altitude.
</P>
<P>
   The Hubble telescope, by contrast, was designed from the start
to be serviced and have its various cameras replaced by shuttle
astronauts. This capability proved crucial when it was discovered
soon after launch that Hubble's main telescope mirror had been made
in the wrong shape, preventing the telescope from focusing
properly. The error was fixed by special corrective mirrors
installed on a later shuttle mission.
</P>
<P>
   Because there will be no second chances this time, Wojtalik
said, testing was crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every test we could think of has been completed and completed
well,'' he said. ``We've done things far beyond what I would say
was normal,'' including having five separate committees check out
all the plans.
</P>
<P>
   Once in operation, the telescope will provide views of X-rays
given off by objects as close as the planets of our own solar
system, and as distant as the furthest quasars at the fringes of
the universe. Its images of these distant objects will be 10 times
more detailed, and it will be able to detect objects up to 100
times fainter, than any previous X-ray telescope.
</P>
<P>
   Chandra is expected to provide new information about black
holes, colliding galaxies, exploding stars, and clouds of gas
floating in space, where extreme high temperatures tend to produce
the X-ray emissions Chandra is designed to detect. Edward Weiler,
NASA's chief of space science, pointed out that Chandra's tenfold
increase in power over previous telescopes is a leap that has only
been equaled a few times in the history of astronomy, such as when
Galileo first turned a telescope toward the heavens, and when the
Hubble Space Telescope was launched.
</P>
<P>
   Those events ``changed the face of astronomy. Chandra has the
capability to equal or exceed those other milestones,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers have plenty of ideas about what to look for with the
new telescope: There were 800 applicants for the 200 available
observing slots during the first year. But, Weiler said, ``some of
the most exciting results will not be about anything'' that
astronomers have even thought about yet. The major findings will
come from ``surprises, something we can't even dream of today.''

<P>
   GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. _ Looking far down the road and envisioning
a time when Michigan might be associated as much with medical
research as with automobiles, Gov. John Engler came here Monday to
sign legislation that will devote $50 million a year to spurring
research in a ``life sciences corridor'' across a southern swath of
the state.
</P>
<P>
   The money _ about $1 billion over 20 years _ will come out of
Michigan's $300-million-a-year share of the states' settlement with
tobacco companies. It will link the state's three most prominent
universities with a new nonprofit medical research center endowed
by a Michigan billionaire, Jay Van Andel, the co-founder of Amway
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the University of Michigan, in Ann Arbor, is
spending $200 million on its own life sciences institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we wanted to do is to have Michigan well positioned for
the future,'' said Engler. The public and private investments
``assure that Michigan is on the leading edge of biomedical
research in the United States and the world,'' the governor said,
and would likely inspire biotechnology companies to move to or
start up in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Michigan is a long way from that vision. Most
cutting-edge life sciences research is done on the East or West
Coasts, and the venture capital firms that pounce on discoveries
and help bring them to market have concentrated around universities
in those places.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of funding will allow Michigan to be very
competitive in an era where the funding required to do life
sciences research has increased,'' said Edward Penhoet, dean of the
school of public health at the University of California at Berkeley
and the founder of Chiron, the nation's third-largest biotechnology
company.
</P>
<P>
   Engler compared the effort here to the early days of Silicon
Valley. ``Part of the reason that was so successful was that there
were so many key people there,'' he said. Michigan will devote 10
percent of the $50 million spent annually to bringing scientists'
discoveries to market. The first $50 million will be spent this
autumn, Engler said, divided among projects that are based mainly
at the University of Michigan, Michigan State University in East
Lansing and Detroit's Wayne State University, along with the Van
Andel Institute in Grand Rapids.
</P>
<P>
   Those involved in the effort are particularly gratified that the
state's portion of the money is part of what the tobacco companies
paid. ``If ever there were to be a poetic justice,'' said Lee
Bollinger, president of the University of Michigan, ``it might well
be that this could be the basis to advancements to human health
that are simply unimaginable at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   The University of Michigan will focus its research on structural
biology, neurobiology and genomics, along with related and
intertwined disciplines like biomedical engineering. The university
is building a complex that will have the latest high-technology
machines along with lab space for an expanded faculty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within our own university we are going to make a truly unique
investment in one area of knowledge,'' said Bollinger. ``This is an
area where there is an advantage to scale.''
</P>
<P>
   The statewide effort comes as complete maps of human genes, once
a scientific dream and now expected in just a few years, are likely
to spark the next generation of research into aging and diseases.
But the research is expected to require heavy investments in
computers and the latest imaging equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Engler signed the legislation under the exposed metal beams of
the Van Andel Institute, a concrete, glass and steel structure
expected to be finished by the end of the year. The first
experiments have already begun under the direction of Dr. George
Vande Woude, now the director of the division of basic sciences at
the National Cancer Institute and soon to be the Van Andel
Institute's director.
</P>
<P>
   Van Andel, 75, who suffers from Parkinson's disease, has
disliked doctors for decades. But like Howard Hughes, he plans to
leave his billions to finance medical research. David Van Andel,
the institute's chairman and chief executive officer, refused to
say exactly how much money his father planned to give to the
institute, but said the pledge would amount to ``the majority of
his estate.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Forbes magazine estimated Van Andel's net
worth at $1.3 billion, but previous estimates put it as high as
$4.2 billion. The institute has already hired a board with four
Nobel laureates on it.
</P>
<P>
   The senior Van Andel is a deeply religious man and there will be
limits placed on the institute's research, his son said. ``We're
not going to be cloning people or anything like that,'' he said.
``There are certain areas that will be off-limits.'' Scientists
involved with the institute noted that they had been told that the
restrictions would be no more onerous than those already
restricting government-financed research.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Brown, a Nobel laureate in medicine who is chairman
of the institute's board of scientific advisers, said of Van
Andel's gift, ``Hopefully, this sets an example for what you do
with a great fortune.''

BOSTON, CAPE LOOMED LARGE IN JOHN KENNEDY'S HERITAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- He worked in Manhattan, played in Central Park and
lived in a trendy neighborhood of New York City, but John F.
Kennedy Jr. maintained ties to the city that gave rise to his
father's political legend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston and the Cape are the spiritual homes of the Kennedy
family and they were John's spiritual homes, too,'' said William J.
vanden Heuvel, a Kennedy family associate for 40 years. ``It's much
more difficult to find spiritual roots in a city like New York than
in a place like Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   John Seigenthaler, chairman of the annual Profile in Courage
Award at the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum, said the
presidential library in Dorchester and the school of government
that carries his name at Harvard University were JFK Jr.
touchstones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he ever came back here to either the school or
the library without reconnecting emotionally with what those two
places stood for,'' Seigenthaler said. ``He fully understood what
it meant for people who saw him in Boston and he fully appreciated
that connection.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides his schoolboy days at Andover, and leisurely summer
afternoons in the surf off Cape Cod, Kennedy's connection to the
cradle of his father's political legacy had more to do with lineage
than residency.
</P>
<P>
   He had few of the deep ties here nurtured over the generations
by his political relatives, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, or former US
Representative Joseph Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   But, officials at Harvard and at his father's library said, he
was no figurehead when it came to discussing modern politics at
Harvard or rewarding political courageousness in Dorchester.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, associates said, insisted that students at the John F.
Kennedy School of Government at Harvard discussed comtemporary
issues with the politicians who grappled with them instead of
learning about them from pages of books.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not enamored in recreating the past but rather in
taking what was great and lasting from the Kennedy legacy and
tuning it to the future,'' said former US Sen. Alan K. Simpson,
director of the Kennedy School's Institute of Politics. ``He was
continually searching for creative ways to see young people become
more involved in our democracy and public life.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, vice chairman of the Kennedy Library Foundation, would
join his sister Caroline each year in selecting the recipient of
the Profile in Courage Award, awarded each year on or near his
father's May 29th birthday. His presence at a fundraiser last May
helped collect $580,000 for the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Massachusetts is a state that gave a very tough time to his
forebears and a state that also gave them political opportunities
and successes, and he clearly related to all of that,''
Seigenthaler said.
</P>
<P>
   And Monday, as the search continued for the wreckage of the
plane that was to have carried him to Martha's Vineyard last
Friday, Bay State residents noted the poignancy of JFK's son
vanishing from the ocean air that the late president once said gave
him strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston was the cradle of his family's political importance and
that was never lost on him,'' said Gerard F. Doherty, a former
Democratic state chairman and a fundraiser for the Kennedy library.
``He loved coming back here.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Thomas M. Menino recalled Kennedy as ``a special person.
It was never, `Look who I am.' It was John Kennedy, the person,
reaching out. He could have conversations with regular people. He
was never caught up with the status he might have had in life. He
was himself, a regular guy. Anyone would have been proud to say `He
was my son.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A JFK Jr. sighting in Boston was almost always a newsworthy
event.
</P>
<P>
   He showed up in 1994 with Menino and other lawmakers to
celebrate the opening of a new health center in Codman Square. He
and his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, were spotted in adjacent
Cambridge for a 1996 get-together hosted by Harvard Professor Henry
Louis Gates Jr. He was a surprise guest last January at the
send-off party for a Kennedy School colleague.
</P>
<P>
   And then, of course, there were the Kennedy campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Doherty recalls Kennedy's aid during the 1994 Senate campaign,
when early polls showed that his uncle might face trouble from his
GOP Senate challenger Mitt Romney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people who have all that lineage have an arrogant side,
but he didn't,'' said Doherty, who ran Robert Kennedy's
presidential campaign in Indiana in 1968. ``You asked him to dust,
he dusted. You asked him to go to Ipswich, he'd go to Ipswich. You
didn't have to say please or pretty-please. We used to talk about
politics in East Boston or his father's start in Charlestown. He
had this interest about where his family had come from.''
</P>
<P>
   Restaurateur Anthony Athanas, whose Pier 4 eatery is a Boston
institution, said he met Kennedy over the years at various family
functions, including a meal after a memorial service for family
matriarch Rose Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``His grandfather used to come into my restaurant in Lynn,''
Athanas said Monday. ``And you could tell Boston meant a lot to
(JFK Jr.). And, carrying that name with the dignity that he
carried, he meant a lot to us, too.''

 &HT;    New quarters unveiled at Georgia Capitol
 &HT;    By Peter Mantius
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bubbly elementary school children lined up in
Georgia's state Capitol Monday to receive free newly-minted Georgia
quarters from U.S. Treasurer Mary Ellen Withrow.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes, U.S. Rep. John Linder and Atlanta Falcons
linebacker Jessie Tuggle also were on hand at an elaborate ceremony
to unveil the new coin that features a peach inside an outline of
the state of Georgia on the new reverse side.
</P>
<P>
   The quarters are being issued as part of the 50 State Quarter
series in the order that states ratified the U.S. Constitution.
Coins honoring Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania have entered
circulation.
</P>
<P>
   The response has been ``overwhelmingly positive'' since the U.S.
Mint began issuing the quarters, Mint officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But locally, bank officials said they weren't aware of huge
public demand for the Georgia quarters, at least not yet.
NationsBank spokesman Mark Williams said he wasn't even sure when
the quarters would arrive from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't tell us,'' Williams said. ``We think they'll start
being available at our banking centers by the end of the week.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Mint plans to circulate 750 million Georgia quarters
nationwide as part of a 10-year plan to honor each state. Williams
urged customers who want the quarters to check first with their
local branch to be sure they are stocked.
</P>
<P>
   Uncirculated Georgia quarters are available through the U.S.
Mint at www.usmint.gov or 1-800-USA-MINT.

COMMENTARY: DOES IRAN NEED A LEADER LIKE CHINA'S?
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN  
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I spoke to an Iranian friend in London the other day who told me
a story about his brother back in Tehran, who had recently visited
one of the popular cyber-cafes in the Iranian capital. His brother
described seeing a bearded, obviously religious young man trading
stocks online, who at one point stood up and shouted across the
Internet cafe, ``Hey, I just made $1,000.''
</P>
<P>
   In a dispatch from Tehran last week, Elaine Sciolino of The New
York Times wrote about going to see the hottest Iranian film, ``Two
Women.'' The film ends with an Iranian woman, who has just been
liberated from her cruel father and loveless husband, declaring her
intention to start life over again, saying: ``I have to go to
computer class. I have to learn how to drive.'' At that line, Ms.
Sciolino reported, the Iranian theater erupted in cheers and
applause.
</P>
<P>
   You can understand a lot about the turmoil brewing in Iran these
days from these two anecdotes. For they are both reminders of the
most consistently under-appreciated factor in international
relations today: the impact on politics all over the world from the
fact that we all increasingly know how one another lives. The more
that happens, the more governments around the world have to promise
the same things, and when they can't deliver, they have a problem.
</P>
<P>
   And the Iranian government has a big, big, problem. Too many
young people in Iran today know how the rest of the world is
living, and they want a slice of it. But their government can't
deliver it, because it has failed to diversify the Iranian economy
away from oil and create enough new jobs to absorb the huge number
of under-25-year-olds coming into the work force. To do that, Iran
would need to be much more open to the world, foreign investors and
new ideas than it currently is.
</P>
<P>
   So the Islamic government's response has been to try to get its
young people not to want the lifestyle others have, by trying to
shut out the world _ and when that hasn't worked the mullahs have
sent vigilantes into student dormitories to beat it out of them.
This is what triggered last week's uprising. No wonder the students
were chanting ``The mullahs have become God and the people have
become poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people thought that when the moderate Mohammad Khatami was
elected Iran's President that Iran finally had its own Ayatollah
Gorbachev, who would synthesize the best of Islam and modernism, as
Mikhail Gorbachev tried with communism and capitalism. Well, guess
what? Not only couldn't Khatami produce such a synthesis, but it
isn't even what Iranian young people want. They don't want
Ayatollah Gorbachev. They want Ayatollah Deng Xiaoping _ the great
Chinese reformer.
</P>
<P>
   What is the difference between Gorby and Deng? Deng understood
that there was no synthesis to be had between communism and
capitalism, and trying to find it was a fool's errand (as Gorbachev
also discovered). After the Tiananmen uprising, Deng offered the
Chinese people a different choice: ``Folks,'' he said, ``here's the
new deal. You can wear what you want, work where you want, live
where you want, study where you want, think at home what you want
and, most of all, make as much money as you want. There is just one
thing you can't do _ and that is challenge the leadership of the
Communist Party. We'll stay out of your lives, you stay out of our
jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   This is clearly what the protesters in Iran want. They are not
calling for the downfall of the Islamic government _ not yet. They
are calling for it to get out of their lives so they can freely
partake of the prosperity, cultural options and opportunities that
today's world-without-walls offers.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's mullahs now have three choices: One is to go on searching
for some Gorbachev-like synthesis between Islam and modernism,
which they will not find. Another is to opt for Ayatollah Deng,
which would mean pretending that Iran is still a theocracy _ the
way China pretends it is still a Maoist state _ but in reality
turning a blind eye to people's personal behavior and setting them
free to run their own lives, provided they don't challenge the
regime. And the third option is to go on trying to rule and run
everyone's personal life, using vigilantes to beat people into
conformity, which simply will not work _ not in an age when
everyone knows how everyone else lives.
</P>
<P>
   Paging Ayatollah Deng. You are needed in Iran.

BARAK SAYS PEACE TALKS COULD PRODUCE RESULTS IN 15 MONTHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, wrapping up
three days of warm private talks with President Clinton, said
Monday he is ready to embark on comprehensive peace negotiations
with Arab leaders and hopes to produce results within 15 months.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister did not characterize the timetable as a
deadline, but he said the prospects for peace should be clear by
then.
</P>
<P>
   In 15 months, which would be October 2000, three months before
the Clinton administration ends, ``we will know whether we have a
breakthrough and are really going to put an end to the conflict or
alternatively _ I hope will not be the case _ we are stuck once
again.''
</P>
<P>
   The stickiest points ahead will be the questions of Jerusalem,
Palestinian refugees, Palestinian statehood and Jewish settlements
on the West Bank. And there will be difficulties in talks with
Syria over the possible return of the Golan Heights in return for
security guarantees and the beginnings of normalization between
Israel and the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli leader said the 15-month ``framework'' was meant to
provide a realistic opening assessment of how long progress might
take. He called it a ``signal to all publics and the cast of
players that we are not talking about a . . . magic solution that
will drop upon us from heaven in three weeks, and we are not
intending to drag our feet for another three years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton-Barak meetings served several purposes for both
leaders, analysts said. It was a chance to put the US-Israel
relationship back in good standing after a rocky period during
under Barak's predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu. It was a chance to
plot the next moves, and to put the priority squarely back on
restarting peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Some top Clinton aides were openly enthusiastic about the
chemistry between Clinton and Barak, but others noted that high
expectations over making peace in the Middle East have historically
been unwise. Even after three historic peace deals, with Egypt, the
Palestinians, and Jordan, Israel's relations with both countries
have yet to fulfill the early hopes.
</P>
<P>
   On his six-day US trip, though, Barak may have given Clinton a
present on the contentious issue of moving the US Embassy from Tel
Aviv to Jerusalem. That was pushed to the background when Barak
said that he wanted all countries to put their embassies in
Jerusalem, but that progress on the peace track could make such
developments much easier.
</P>
<P>
   The administration hopes Barak will make that point in visits
Tuesday to Congress, which has pushed strongly for the embassy
move. ``We're hoping that he tells'' them ``to just put it on hold
until we see what happens with the peace talks,'' said a senior
administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Barak ``has done quite well here,'' said Chemi Shalev, a
well-connected political analyst who writes for the Israeli daily
Maariv. ``First of all this was a success that was screenwritten in
advance, a visit that couldn't fail. But he had several aims when
he left, and he accomplished them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli prime minister showed again, said Shalev, that
``deadlines are part of his game plan. You look at the model of his
negotiations over coalition government, and how it's always before
a deadline that a dramatic breakthrough happens. And now in this
15-month schedule, which is determined by the American political
schedule, he is looking for the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak, the most decorated soldier in the 51-year history of the
state of Israel, also revealed some of his world view, which like
many of his opinions is closely held. He indicated Israel cannot
let down its guard in such a dangerous neighborhood, but said the
only way to make the neighborhood safer was to find paths toward
peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about ``the real existential threats'' to Israel in the
coming years, specifically the perceived threats from Iraq and
Iran, Barak described the Middle East through a military lens,
saying it was a ``kind of merciless environment, no second
opportunity for those who cannot defend themselves. And many
threats might loom over the horizon without . . . early warning.
This is one of the reasons why I'm so determined to do whatever we
can to achieve peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told the Israeli leader that he will now contact Syrian
President Hafez Assad about restarting Israeli-Syrian talks.
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright is expected to make a trip
to Damascus and Jerusalem within a month.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said he will implement the Wye Plantation accord, a
land-for-security deal that was sealed last fall and suspended by
Israel soon after, but said he wants to wrap it accord into ``the
final status negotiations,'' which the Palestinians are likely to
oppose strongly.
</P>
<P>
   A second issue sure to draw more fire is whether Clinton should
release Jonathan Pollard, the former CIA analyst caught turning
over US secrets to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Barak raised the release of Pollard in his talks with Clinton,
said National Security Adviser Samuel R. ``Sandy'' Berger, but
``said it was not part of their negotiations.'' Last fall, at the
tail end of the Wye talks, Netanyahu asked Clinton to release
Pollard. Clinton said no, after strong opposition from
administration officials including CIA head George Tenet.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Six years ago this month, a disgruntled
businessman named Gian Luigi Ferri took two TEC-9 semiautomatic
pistols into the office tower at 101 California St. here and, in
less than 15 minutes, killed eight people and wounded six others,
before turning a gun on himself in a stairwell and committing
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The sound of those shots has rung through California politics
ever since, helping to inspire a long-running debate over gun
control that reached a milestone Monday when Gov. Gray Davis signed
into law the nation's toughest and most comprehensive ban on
assault-style weapons. It passed the state legislature by 2-1
margins last week, after years of partisan feuding and the veto of
a similar measure by Davis' Republican predecessor, Pete Wilson,
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends, guns do kill people,'' Davis said at an elaborate
signing ceremony at the San Francisco Hall of Justice, surrounded
by a sea of highway patrol and police officers and relatives of the
victims of the 101 California shootings. ``In short, assault
weapons on our street are an assault on our common values. Today,
California fights back.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Congress battled to a fierce deadlock over gun control
after the Columbine High School shootings this spring, state
legislatures were passing substantial measures. Political
professionals in both parties here say the California bill's
passage reflects a steady shift in public opinion and political
winds in a state that first passed a law banning dozens of specific
weapons in 1989, after five children were shot to death in an
elementary schoolyard in Stockton.
</P>
<P>
   But gun manufacturers eluded that law by changing the names and
model numbers of the banned weapons. The new measure aims to close
that loophole by outlawing characteristics instead of specific
weapons, essentially banning the manufacture, import or sale of any
semi-automatic rifles or pistols that can hold more than 10 rounds
of ammunition or can be easily concealed, or have any one of
various accessories like pistol grips or folding stocks _ a
stricter standard than the existing federal ban on some 20 types of
assault weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The new law also makes it a crime to manufacture, import, sell
or give away any magazine that can hold more than 10 rounds of
ammunition. And earlier Monday, Davis signed a separate measure
barring any individual from buying more than one handgun in a
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a prototype for reasonable gun-control legislation,
and if it can be done in California I would argue that it can be
done in the United States as a whole,'' said Sen. Don Perata, a
Democrat and a former Alameda County school teacher who sponsored
the assault weapons measure. ``This state is large enough and
diverse enough to reflect the diversity of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   This is not, as many people would think, a progressive state.
There are ways in which it's pretty conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the New York region, Connecticut and New Jersey ban the sales
of assault weapons, but New York state does not, and while New
Jersey prohibits the sale of ammunition clips with more than 15
rounds, Connecticut and New York have no such bans. None of those
three states limit the number of handguns that someone can buy in a
month, though Maryland, South Carolina, Virginia and Los Angeles
limit such sales to one a month.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The ban on assault weapons, which takes effect Jan. 1, may be
heavily symbolic. No one knows for certain how many such weapons
exist in California now, and owners of guns covered by the ban will
have a year to register their weapons or face penalties, of up to
$500 for first-time offenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good politics from the sponsors' perspective, but it's
close to completely meaningless,'' said Steve Helsley, the
California lobbyist for the National Rifle Association, who
nevertheless fought the measure vigorously and now contends that
weapons banned by the bill could be easily converted to elude it,
by sawing off a pistol grip, for example. ``This is political
buffoonery, and it is going to inconvenience a lot of people. It
will result in people going to jail who didn't know what they were
doing wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is precisely the powerful symbolism of restricting what
Davis, a Vietnam veteran, on Monday called a ``weapon of war,''
that has made this a potent political issue _ one that Davis and
his fellow Democrats used with great success in last year's
statewide elections and that they expect to use again next year
against Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, if he becomes the Republican
presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Political experts here say, the latest law succeeded because it
focused on the extraordinary category of weapons with
large-capacity ammunition and special features that the public is
most wary about. National polls have consistently shown that
roughly three-quarters of respondents support a ban on assault type
weapons, while most oppose a ban on all handguns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, we've just had such a string of incidents,
starting with the Stockton schoolyard and going to the North
Hollywood bank robbery, and all of those had assault weapons,''
said Bill Carrick, a leading Democratic political consultant and an
adviser to Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who was one of the state's
earliest and most unwavering advocates of gun control. ``I think
it's just left a deeper, more indelible impression on Californians'
political consciousness than in the rest of the country. The whole
thing has had a long, 10-year run as a major issue, and it's played
its way through a lot of campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Davis himself has undergone something of a sea change on the
issue. Though he voted for an assault weapons ban that failed to
pass as a member of the state assembly in 1985, longtime colleagues
say Davis was also deeply spooked by an unsuccessful 1982 state
ballot measure that would have frozen the number of handguns in the
state and was widely seen as helping draw conservative voters to
the polls to defeat the Democratic gubernatorial candidate that
year, Tom Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Davis advisers took pains to emphasize that the assault weapons
ban was a reasonable and sensible measure, and that Davis, who
campaigned last year as a passionate moderate, remained one. The
governor's aides have warned that Davis will not sign all of
perhaps 10 gun control measures that are headed to his desk this
year, though he is expected to approve bills setting safety
standards for so-called junk guns, the cheap handguns known as
Saturday night specials, and a requirement that guns be sold with
child safety locks.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Tony Quinn, a Republican strategist in Sacramento, acknowledged
that ``the Republicans have totally bobbled this issue as far as
suburban voters go.'' But he added, ``Now the dynamic will change,
and the Democrats will have to produce some results. We're told
that crimes will go down if we pass these bans on assault weapons,
so let's see them go down.''

   Disney's Second Ship: Ahoy, Little Mermaid &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Walt Disney Co. knows a good thing when it sells it. So it
should be no surprise that its second cruise ship will be much the
same as its first. The Disney Wonder, scheduled to begin sailing
Aug. 15, will look just like the Disney Magic from the pier. And
once a passenger boards, the differences will be mainly
decorative. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Where the Magic is Art Deco, the Wonder will be Art Nouveau.
Where a statue of Mickey Mouse dominates the lobby of the Magic, in
the Wonder's lobby, designed by Adam Tihany, it will be Ariel, the
Little Mermaid. In the Magic's top restaurant, Lumiere's, the mural
is a scene from ``Beauty and the Beast,'' while on the Wonder, the
mural in Triton's will be from ``The Little Mermaid.''
</P>
<P>
   The sister ships, both built by Fincantieri Shipyards in Italy,
are 83,000 tons, with 12 decks and 875 cabins for up to 2,400
passengers. Both have three pools and three dining rooms, and use a
dining plan that places passengers in a different restaurant each
night.
</P>
<P>
   Both sail from Port Canaveral, Fla., on three- or four-day
cruises to Nassau and Castaway Cay, Disney's private island in the
Bahamas. Sailings can be combined with three or four days at Disney
World. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One thing Disney hopes will be different between the two liners
is the start-up: last year's Magic debut was postponed twice by
construction delays. The company says the Wonder is on schedule for
the Aug. 15 debut. She will sail every Thursday and Sunday, the
Magic on Monday and Friday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prices for the two ships are the same: $434 to $2,864 a person,
double occupancy; $799 to $4,089 for a seven-day cruise and Disney
World vacation. Information: (800) 939-2784 or

   Edinburgh Landmark Opens as Festival Site &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of Edinburgh's most prominent landmarks, the Highland
Tolbooth _ a 19th-century Gothic-style structure that was once a
church _ has been recently transformed into the Edinburgh Festival
Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Hub, as it is called, opened this month, with a shop, a cafe
with terrace and a main hall, which will be used for a variety of
events, including public workshops and lectures. During the
Edinburgh International Jazz and Blues Festival, Friday through
Aug. 8.
</P>
<P>
   The Hub will sell tickets and serve as a site for performances
such as the Ladies in Jazz concert on Aug. 2 at 3 p.m., with Edith
Budge, Cathie Rae and Sophie Bancroft and, on Aug. 5 at 8 p.m., a
concert with Larry Adler on the harmonica and the pianist Brian
Kellock and Ken Peplowski, the saxophonist and clarinetist.
</P>
<P>
   During the Edinburgh Festival, Aug. 15 to Sept. 4, the building
will be a gathering place for participating artists and Festival
Club members, who can use the main hall, where they can have a
glass of wine or a meal, and library from 10 a.m. to 2 a.m.. For
those attending the festival, club membership is $7.95 a day,
$39.75 for seven days. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 1845 building, with its 228-foot ornate spire (the tallest
point in Edinburgh) and stained-glass windows, was designed by
James Gillespie Graham and Augustus Welby Pugin as the Assembly
Hall and offices for the Church of Scotland. It continued as a
church until the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The $12 million renovation by Benjamin Tindall Architects
includes commissioned work from local artisans, with stained glass
for the library windows by the Edinburgh-based artist Christine
Shaw; colorful tiles, created by Carole Vincent, a Cornish artist,
form a path from the gates to the entrance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Hub is at Castlehill, Royal Mile; (44-131) 473 2001, fax

   Two Manatees Star In Cincinnati Exhibit &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two Florida manatees have moved to the Cincinnati Zoo and
Botanical Garden in a new exhibit that showcases more than 50
animal species native to Florida. The manatees, who collectively
weigh in at more than 1,600 pounds, are the star inhabitants of
Manatee Springs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When visitors enter the 15,000-square-foot exhibit, they are
surrounded by tropical trees, swamp plants and the songs of rails,
cattle egrets, woodpeckers and scrub jays. After following a wooden
boardwalk to a wetland area, they will encounter a 12-foot American
crocodile and several alligators. They can be observed through
cutaway glass as they relax below the waterline or sun themselves
on rocks above it.
</P>
<P>
   In the manatee habitat, visitors can climb into a large acrylic
bubble to bring them nose to nose with the large vegetarians. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit is filled with interactive games. One shows how to
identify manatees from scars or markings; another uses satellite
technology to track two in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Admission to Manatee Springs, which is open daily, is included
in the general admission to the Cincinnati Zoo, at 3400 Vine
Street. Prices are $10, $4.75 ages 12 and under. Information: (513)

   Now Skiers Can Stay At a Summer Behemoth &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Any homeowner who has stayed at New Hampshire's Mount Washington
Hotel and Resort _ one of the last of the behemoth,
turn-of-the-century, seasonal grand hotels that used to dot the New
England landscape _ probably paused a moment to wonder just what it
would cost to heat the place. The resort's owners have decided to
find out. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This winter the hotel, a National Historic Landmark in Bretton
Woods, will celebrate its first winter season since it opened in
1902. It cost $2 million to winterize the rambling six-story stucco
hotel, spectacularly situated near the base of Mount Washington,
the Northeast's highest peak.
</P>
<P>
   The project included replacing more than 800 windows in the 200
guest rooms with double-pane insulated glass, installing
thermostats in the guest rooms, blowing in two tons of insulation,
building a backup boiler system and adding an electric generator. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The opening of the Mount Washington's winter season coincides
with the expansion of the Bretton Woods Ski Area, which is owned by
the consortium that owns the hotel. That ski area, which will have
the most alpine ski terrain in New Hampshire including about two
dozen new trails and a new quad chairlift, and the Bretton Woods
Cross Country Ski Center _ with 1,700 acres for Nordic skiing,
snowshoeing and telemarking _ will both open Nov. 25.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel also will offer sleigh rides, sledding and skating on
a new outdoor rink. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The hotel will close Oct. 24 and reopen Nov. 24 with a party.
Various theme weekends have been scheduled, including several
Christmas parties, a winter carnival, a Millennium New Year
Celebration and Mardi Gras. Several family-fun weeks are also on
the calendar.
</P>
<P>
   Winter rates are the same as summer rates, which begin at $209
weeknights, double occupancy, breakfast and dinner included, and
range up to $1,199 a night on weekends for a suite with a hot tub
on the roof. Mount Washington Hotel and Resort, Route 302, Bretton
Woods, N.H. 03575; (800) 258-0330 or (603) 278-1000; fax (603)

   Toys in the Pre-Nintendo Era &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What a cast: Potato Head, Barbie, G.I. Joe and Raggedy Ann and
Andy. What props: Frisbees, Matchbox cars, Flexible Flyers,
Slinkys, Easy-Bake Ovens, Lionel trains _ to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   And what memories are evoked by these and other things gathered
for the exhibition ``Kid Stuff: Great Toys From Our Childhood,'' on
view through Oct. 17 at the Shelburne Museum in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Based on ``Kid Stuff,'' a book by David Hoffman (Chronicle
Books), the show was created by the Berkshire Museum in Pittsfield,
Mass. It includes more than 40 of the most popular toys and games
of the last 50 years and explains how they were made and used.
</P>
<P>
   At the exhibition, you'll see things that take flight (Wiffle
balls and planes made of balsa wood), that are used to build with
(Erector sets, Lincoln Logs and Tinkertoys) and View-Master reels
that give a glimpse of the country's national parks in 3-D.
</P>
<P>
   You can toss a Nerf ball at china, make something with Lego
bricks, have pictures taken with Barbie and G.I. Joe, or doodle on
an Etch-A-Sketch. For variety, it's hard to match Pez dispensers:
there are 50 different ones.
</P>
<P>
   At the Shelburne Museum, ``Kid Stuff'' tickets are being sold
separately for $6, $3 for children 6 to 14, or included in a
general museum admission price of $17.50, $7 for children. Open
daily from late May to late October. The museum is on Route 7 in
Shelburne, seven miles south of Burlington. Information: (802)
985-3346.
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for the exhibit to make stops at the Museum of
Science and Industry in Chicago (Nov. 20, 1999, to Jan. 2, 2000),
the Duluth Children's Museum in Minnesota (June 17 to Sept. 10,
2000), the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Mich. (Feb. 10 to Sept 9,
2001), and the Liberty Science Center in Jersey City (June 15,
2002, to Jan. 6, 2003).

 &HT;    Two largest Internet used-car sellers merge
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Autoconnect.com and Auto Trader Online, the two
largest sellers of used cars on the Internet, have merged into a
new company, officials announced today.
</P>
<P>
   The new company, to be called AutoTrader.com, will be based in
Atlanta. Its top executive will be Victor ``Chip'' Perry, who is
currently president and chief executive of Autoconnect.
</P>
<P>
   Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   But executives of the two merging companies said AutoTrader.com,
to be launched this fall, would offer a database of more than 1.5
million used cars and trucks. That would be the single largest
inventory of used vehicles online, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``By combining Autoconnect.com, Auto Trader Online, AutoTrader
offers the pre-eminent used car and used truck shopping site,''
said Dennis Berry, president chief executive of Manheim Auctions.
</P>
<P>
   Manheim, a unit of Atlanta-based Cox Enterprises Inc., owns
Autoconnect.com.
</P>
<P>
   Auto Trader is owned by Trader Publishing Co., a joint venture
of Landmark Communications and Cox Enterprises. Trader Publishing
owns weekly magazines that feature advertisements for cars and
boats. Landmark also owns the Atlanta-based Weather Channel.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new AutoTrader.com, consumers may post vehicles for
sale without charge. In addition, dealers and private-party sellers
will also post cars for sale.
</P>
<P>
   AutoTrader.com is tapping into a big market. Used cars outsell
new models by a margin of 4-to-1. Some 41 million used cars worth
$370 billion were sold last year, according to the National
Automotive Association.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, 10.5 million new cars worth $303 billion were
sold in the same period.
</P>
<P>
   AutoTrader.com can be found this fall at www.autotrader.com.

 &HT;    Struggling UPN gives black actors a home
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ When the NAACP's Kweisi Mfume denounced the
television networks last week for not featuring enough minorities
in their new fall series, he definitely wasn't including UPN in his
condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   The sixth-ranked (out of six) network, still struggling in its
fifth year trying to figure out what it wants to be, has at least
figured out that it's a home to African-American shows and
multiracial casts.
</P>
<P>
   Of five new UPN series being added in the fall, ``The Parkers''
(a spinoff of the popular sitcom ``Moesha'') has an all-black cast,
``Grown-Ups'' stars Jaleel White (formerly Urkel on ``Family
Matters''), and ``Shasta McNasty'' and ``Secret Agent Man'' both
have black actors in leading roles. The fifth show that UPN is
adding is the World Wrestling Federation's ``Smackdown,'' which _
no matter what else one says about it _ does feature minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a deep commitment to reflecting on the air the way the
country looks,'' Dean Valentine, president of UPN, said Monday.
``I've always felt it was good business and responsible business. I
think it's still short-sighted to alienate an entire community.''
But even Valentine admitted that, while UPN has a great track
record with black actors, it's still woefully short on Latinos and
Asians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe the networks are intentionally doing this, but
they have to pay attention,'' said Ralph Farquhar, executive
producer of ``The Parkers.'' ``It was a bad, bad year (for
minorities). But it's never been a particularly great year.''

   UPN's biggest star is probably Brandy Norwood, who juggles
starring in ``Moesha'' with a hugely successful singing career. In
fact, Norwood is virtually an entire industry. Mattel will release
a Brandy doll next year, billed as a ``celebrity friend'' of
Barbie, and she will be featured in a new line of DC Comics. She
also appeared on VH1's ``Divas Live'' special and in the teen
horror flick ``I Still Know What You Did Last Summer.''
</P>
<P>
   And Norwood has been named a spokesperson for UNICEF. ``I want
to get more involved in community things, be more like Princess
Diana,'' she said. ``I'll be going to Africa, visiting kids, trying
to bring some happiness.'' She said she's proud to be on a network
that supports minorities, even if it's a network that has an image
problem.
</P>
<P>
   The problem has been that UPN has never come up with a single
game plan that worked. Whereas the WB, which also launched five
years ago, quickly evolved into a network filled with good-looking
young white people, UPN has tried a little of everything. Its shows
include ``Star Trek Voyager,'' ``Dilbert,'' ``Moesha'' and now, in
the fall, professional wrestling. Last season, UPN lost viewers at
the highest rate of any of the broadcast networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This season you'll see a UPN of stability, not of chaos,'' Tom
Nunan, president of UPN Entertainment, said Monday. The network's
new approach is to be ``guy-friendly,'' hence the wrestling and
shows such as ``Shasta McNasty,'' which is described as a cross
between the Beastie Boys and the Monkees.
</P>
<P>
   Although UPN has struggled in the ratings nationally, its
Atlanta affiliate, WUPA, does much better than the network in
general.
</P>
<P>
   NEW FALL TV SEASON NOTES
</P>
<P>
   A new `High Noon'
</P>
<P>
   TBS announced plans to remake ``High Noon,'' the 1952 classic
western starring Gary Cooper. But not every member of the Turner
family of stations thinks it's a wise move.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're basically doing is cashing in on the title to try
to get an audience,'' said Robert Osborne, on-air host of Turner
Classic Movies. ``Who can compete with Gary Cooper in that part? I
always wish they'd go and remake those awful movies that were based
on great books that did a terrible version the first time. But
since we have Turner Classic Movies and you can see great films
like `High Noon,' there's no point in doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart as `Napoleon'
</P>
<P>
   Having Patrick Stewart play Scrooge in a new film version of ``A
Christmas Carol'' was a no-brainer. Though better known to
videophiles as Capt. Jean-Luc Picard on ``Star Trek: The Next
Generation,'' Stewart has spent much of the past decade performing
a one-man version of the Dickens classic on stage. Stewart's next
Scrooge will be in Robert Halmi Sr.'s latest classic for the
masses, airing Dec. 5 on TNT.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who also played Ahab in Halmi's ``Moby Dick'' last
year, said Halmi was on the set of ``A Christmas Carol'' one day
and said, `Patrick, how would you like to play Napoleon?'''
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of playing Scrooge in a grimy dressing gown, Stewart
said he had dreamy visions of ``magnificent uniforms, beautiful
women with swelling breasts and see-through skirts, fantastic
horses and hundreds of thousands of troops.''
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``Yes, Robert, yes! I'll play Napoleon!''
</P>
<P>
   So, on Oct. 3, also on TNT, you'll hear Stewart as the voice of
Napoleon the pig in Halmi's version of ``Animal Farm.''

AS REFORM PARTY GATHERS, MANY PONDER ITS ROLE NEXT YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (Resending to fix byline) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By MAX B. BAKER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Considered a spoiler in the 1992 presidential race, Dallas
billionaire Ross Perot's independent party must cautiously pick its
presidential candidate or face political extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of New Hampshire Sen. Bob Smith, former Connecticut
Gov. Lowell Weicker Jr., and political pundit Pat Buchanan are
expected to seek the Reform Party's support at its national
convention in Dearborn, Mich., this week.
</P>
<P>
   Their interest in the loose-knit, maverick political party _
which its leaders say exists mostly through a post office box and
cyberspace _ follows Minnesota Gov. Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura's
stunning election last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Republicans and Democrats nominate George Bush or Al
Gore or Bill Bradley, it will be the Bore Wars,'' said Russ Verney,
the Reform Party's Dallas-based chairman and a Perot confidante.
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party not only brings name recognition to the
candidate it picks, more importantly it provides ballot access in
most of the states and $12.5 million in federal election money, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've only seen the tip of the iceberg of people who want to
come forward for the nomination. One year ago, people didn't know
who Jesse Ventura was,'' Verney said. ``Reports of our demise have
been exaggerated for seven years.''
</P>
<P>
   Political observers warn, however, that if Perot's party doesn't
unite behind a big-name candidate next year _ and garner at least
double-digit support at the polls _ the Reform Party movement may
be down for the count.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Perot got 19 percent of the vote by tapping into the
public's disaffection with government and voters' willingness to
split their tickets. But by 1996, his support dwindled to about 8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a third party doesn't do it this time, it is goodbye third
party,'' said Weicker, a Republican who formed a new party to run
for governor. ``They sure as hell have to get into the double
digits in the number of votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Known as a volatile, eclectic group made up of mostly political
neophytes, the Reform Party also can't let infighting over party
leadership divide its membership. Ventura is feuding with Perot
over party leadership and location.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will all depend on Perot's willingness to let go since he
bankrolled this thing,'' said Curtis Gans, director of the
Committee for the Study of the American Electorate. ``It does
suggest a greater volatility.''
</P>
<P>
   Perot spent seven years and millions of dollars building the
party. In 1992, brandishing pie charts and pleading for a balanced
budget, the Dallas entrepreneur debated President George Bush and
challenger Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Perot's on-again, off-again presidential campaign
that year lost steam, but still drew unprecedented support for a
third-party candidate. Pundits said Perot's presence may have cost
Bush the election.
</P>
<P>
   By 1996, however, Perot's clout faded. Torn by intra-party
discord, leaders of the party quit, complaining about control from
Dallas. Before Ventura's victory, Perot flirted with being a
political footnote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in 1992, he was the centrist candidate but by 1996 he
was branded as a cartoon,'' said Bruce Buchanan, political science
professor at the University of Texas at Austin. ``His quirkiness
got more attention than his message.''
</P>
<P>
   Perot has to learn when to let go, others said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The history of our party system is that third parties have had
a hard time and they don't sustain themselves past their
founders,'' said James Riddlesperger, a political science professor
at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Perot isn't talking about his presidential aspirations.
He is scheduled to speak at the convention on Saturday. Ventura
said he will not run for the Oval Office in 2000 or seek national
Reform Party post. But he's endorsed Jack Gargan from Florida to be
the next party chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Gargan's platform is to move the party headquarters to
Florida and away from Perot to open up the field for other
presidential candidates. Ventura said he won't support Perot for
president. The Reform Party will select its presidential nominee
next summer.
</P>
<P>
   In what some took as an ultimatum, Ventura has threatened not to
embrace the national party if Gargan loses, and it was the governor
and his staff who encouraged Weicker to seek the party's
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Weicker, a former Republican U.S. senator and political
maverick, ran as an independent for governor in 1990. He is
undecided about seeking the nomination. In 1995, he avoided contact
with Perot and the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not made up my mind at all,'' Weicker said from his
farm near Hartford. ``I'm not sitting here panting after a
nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he.MDBR/.MDNM/ praised Perot for opening up American
politics, Weicker said that if the Dallas billionaire makes a third
bid for the Oval Office, it may impede the chances of any
third-party candidate winning in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get a good, solid centrist candidate out there as a
representative of the Reform Party, and that gives all of us as
independents a chance to unseat the Democrats and Republicans,''
Weicker said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Truax, the Reform Party's Southwest regional representative
in Addison, reacted negatively to Ventura's courting of Weicker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is beyond ridiculous to handpick the presidential
candidate,'' Truax said. ``This party is made up of people who are
independents, and they have strong wills and they can't be dictated
to by anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders probably are a little worried about Smith and
Buchanan taking significant numbers of conservative voters from the
likely GOP nominee, Gov. George W. Bush, political analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly they cringed when Smith, who quit the Republican Party
last week to be an independent, accused the GOP of being run by
pollsters and consultants advising candidates to steer clear of
issues like abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many who want to lead our party _ specifically candidate Bush
_ won't take a position on these issues,'' Smith said. He said he
can win the White House with a coalition of those disenchanted with
the two major parties.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, political scientists said. Unless you have Perot's
money, it becomes difficult for a third-party candidate to win
unless they have the stature of, say, Gen. Colin Powell, the former
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   Those predictions come despite statistics from states where
voters actually pick a political party before voting _ only 29
percent claimed to be Democrats and 22 percent Republicans, Gans'
American Electorate group reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in the year 2000, we are not talking about a serious
bolt to a third party,'' Gans said. ``Smith's candidacy may do
great things for the country and the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to prove how small the constituency of these guys
are. It is going to help the Republican Party candidate appear
moderate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But there is value in having the kind of open debate that a
third-party candidate brings to the campaign trail, Verney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conventional wisdom is always clear, concise and wrong,''
Verney said. ``The major parties think that they own these votes
and lose them to a third party. But the voters own them and they
have to go out and earn them.''

CAMPAIGN TARGETS AWARENESS OF SOCIAL ANXIETY DISORDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JAN JARVIS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The only time Larry Putteet went to the
movies was on Tuesday afternoons when no one else was there.
</P>
<P>
   He'd wait until 3 a.m. to slip into a 24-hour grocery store or
dart into a 7-Eleven. He avoided malls, did not work and stopped
eating at restaurants when someone tried to make small talk. If an
acquaintance walked his way, he would head in the opposite
direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just a lost person,'' he said. ``I didn't want people to
know me.''
</P>
<P>
   Now after a lifetime of hiding, Putteet, 43, is discovering the
satisfaction of everyday social activities. Medication and therapy
are helping him cope with the devastating effects of a disorder
that until recently he didn't know had a name.
</P>
<P>
   Social anxiety disorder affects an estimated 10 million
Americans and is the third most common psychiatric illness after
depression and alcoholism, according to the American Psychiatric
Association. But because of the embarrassment of those afflicted,
few seek treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Most do as Putteet: They avoid people and small talk at all
costs. Unlike agoraphobics, who fear being in crowds, people with
social anxiety disorder have an intense fear of being scrutinized
by others.
</P>
<P>
   Putteet agreed to be interviewed _ something so difficult that
he would have never considered it before treatment _ to encourage
others to seek help. Others with the disorder contacted for this
story were unable to even talk over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   The disorder can appear suddenly, as it did for the vice
president of a large company who almost quit his job when he could
no longer speak at sales meetings. Or it can permeate every moment
of every day, preventing sufferers from dating, working or talking
to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about being a little shy,'' said Jim Wilson,
director of the Phobia and Anxiety Center of the Southwest in
Dallas. ``It's about being immobilized.''
</P>
<P>
   To heighten awareness of this disorder, the American Psychiatric
Association, Anxiety Disorders Association of America and Freedom
from Fear have launched a campaign called ``Imagine Being Allergic
to People.'' Information about the disorder is available through an
Internet site (www/allergictopeople.com) and a toll-free phone
number _ (800) 934-6276.
</P>
<P>
   In its most severe form, the disorder causes sufferers to
experience intense anxiety about everyday activities such as eating
out, using a public restroom or talking on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people have a constant, steady fear of being scrutinized
by others,'' said Nishendu Vasavada, a Dallas psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
   Society tends to amplify this fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our society is very ridicule-oriented,'' said Clark Vinson, a
therapist in Arlington, midway between Dallas and Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turn on any sitcom, and you'll see tons of jokes and people
making fun of other people,'' he said. ``Social phobics understand
that people make judgments, and they put a lot of judgmental
thoughts in everyone's head.''
</P>
<P>
   For Putteet, the fear that others were making fun of him made
for a most difficult life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't worked in 20 years,'' he said. ``I have no
interests, no hobbies.''
</P>
<P>
   The disorder can be generalized, as it is with Putteet, but it
can also show up in seemingly bizarre, isolated ways.
</P>
<P>
   Some people won't write checks because their hand shakes
uncontrollably when attention is focused on them. They believe the
clerk thinks they're crazy, lying or stealing.
</P>
<P>
   Others stop attending church because receiving communion causes
so much anxiety or the fear of being asked to lead a prayer is
unbearable.
</P>
<P>
   At the movies, they're often the ones in the aisle seats because
they feel trapped otherwise. The attention that they believe will
be focused on them if they have to go to the restroom is unbearable
for them.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms include trembling, sweating, upset stomach, tense
muscles and lightheadedness. Often the person's mind goes blank,
and panic sweeps over them.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, they feel like a big spotlight is on them,
saying `loser,' '' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   In Putteet's case, he would often get so nervous that he
hyperventilated.
</P>
<P>
   Although the disorder is widespread, only 5 percent of those
with it are treated.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest barriers to getting treatment is the person
feels so humiliated that they won't tell anyone about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A social phobic is not going to do anything that calls
attention to themselves,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Sufferers wait an average of eight years before confiding in a
friend about the problem, Vasavada said. They wait 13 years to seek
professional help. Often it is chest pains or headaches and not
anxiety that finally takes them to a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Putteet received treatment only after his wife, one of the few
people he has ever been able to talk with, mentioned his symptoms
to a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Cognitive therapy and medication are usually used to treat the
disorder. Paxil, the first medication the FDA has approved for
treatment, changed Putteet's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a miracle drug,'' he said. ``I still have this
anxiety, and I have to push myself to do stuff, but now I can; then
I couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   When the fear occurs only in certain situations, such as when
speaking to a group, some people can take medication to lower their
blood pressure before the event, Vinson said.
</P>
<P>
   The phobia is truly one of the most difficult to treat because a
phobia is an irrational fear, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an unreal threat,'' he said. ``You truly can
become a complete idiot in front of an audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Helping the sufferers achieve a more realistic understanding of
events can help desensitize them to situations, Vinson said. After
a while they realize they do not look nearly as nervous as they
think they look, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem in seeking treatment is that so often, social
phobics see medication as a crutch and a sure sign that they are
inferior, Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the exact cause is unknown, studies show that
biological and psychological factors play a role. Women develop it
more often than men.
</P>
<P>
   There might be a genetic link. Some research shows that children
of shy people may experience the disorder more than the average
child.
</P>
<P>
   Research also suggests that people with the disorder grow up in
an environment that focuses more on their mistakes than their
successes, Vinson said.
</P>
<P>
   But that does not mean the child has hypercritical parents. Any
embarrassing experiences during childhood can trigger a lifetime of
fear, Vinson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have had bad experiences in elementary school
where they were embarrassed in front of their classmates,'' he
said. ``A number have thrown up in their cafeterias or classroom,
and it stuck with them forever.''
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Putteet stayed in his room or sat in the back of the
classroom to avoid contact. His fear of appearing stupid made every
day difficult, but, he said, he finished high school with the help
of a loving and supportive family.
</P>
<P>
   Now Putteet is thinking about his future and all the things he's
able to do. Recently he went to the movies for the first time on a
Saturday night, and he's thinking about college.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little things are big miracles to me,'' he said. ``I feel like
a different person inside.''

AUTOWORKER CLAIMING SEXUAL HARASSMENT AWARDED $21 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)  (mk) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ A local jury awarded $21 million Monday to a woman who
said she had been sexually harassed at a DaimlerChrysler AG factory
here that builds the Jeep Grand Cherokee.
</P>
<P>
   The company vowed to appeal the verdict, which involved just one
plaintiff, Linda Gilbert. She contended that obscene cartoons and
Polaroid photos had been shown to her over the years and that
someone had even urinated on her chair. ``From the moment Linda was
hired in 1992, she was subjected to the most outrageous,
intolerable and obscene acts of sexual harassment that I have ever
heard of,'' said her lawyer, Geoffrey Fieger, who is best known as
the former lawyer for Jack Kevorkian, the advocate of assisted
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Fieger said that with interest, the award could reach $45
million.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler officials disagreed with that estimate, saying
the verdict was only for $21 million. They said Ms. Gilbert should
have been required in court to accuse specific colleagues in all
five cases of misconduct she described. Ms. Gilbert did identify
one colleague; DaimlerChrysler said that employee had received a
written reprimand. The company also said that Ms. Gilbert's request
for a transfer to another work area within the factory had been
granted.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate case last year, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. reached a
$34 million settlement with the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission after the federal agency accused the company of allowing
an atmosphere of sexual hostility to prevail at its factory in
Normal, Ill., including the distribution of lewd photographs.
Earlier this month the money was distributed to the 486 women who
participated in the lawsuit, said John Hendrickson, a lawyer for
the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor Co. has been trying to settle a lawsuit that was
filed by a group of women contending sexual harassment at a factory
in Chicago that builds Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable sedans.

SHE'S GOT CELEBRITY STATUS, BUT AT HEART, JANET EVANOVICH IS STILL
`MOM'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many women put their dreams on hold until the kids are grown and
off to college. Janet Evanovich, for example, decides to write a
book like she always wanted and keeps on writing until one is
published.
</P>
<P>
   Then she strikes gold. One book becomes a bestseller, and
eventually another makes it to the top of all the major bestseller
lists, among them The New York Times. She sells the rights to
Hollywood, and Mom becomes a celebrity author. She and Dad move to
the mountains and live happily ever after.
</P>
<P>
   The odds against this dream coming true defy calculation, and
yet it just happened to the 56-year-old Evanovich. ``High Five''
(St. Martin's, $23.95), her fifth book in a mystery/comedy series
featuring New Jersey bounty hunter Stephanie Plum, has reached the
Times fiction list and, at least for one week, toppled Thomas
Harris' ``Hannibal'' from No. 1 in Tarrant County.
</P>
<P>
   So Evanovich, stopping at the Star-Telegram last week during a
national tour promoting ``High Five,'' was asked for her reaction.
Screams of glee seemed appropriate, tears of joy even better.
</P>
<P>
   Evanovich thought, thought some more, and finally said, ``I
can't relate to the celebrity author image; I'm still Mom inside.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Mom, however, who created Stephanie Plum, a klutzy
heroine who, despite her own bumblings and those of a colorful,
quirky supporting cast, always manages to track down the bad guys.
It took six years and five printed adventures before Stephanie
joined Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta and Sue Grafton's Kinsey
Millhone among the upper ranks of fictional sleuth stars.
</P>
<P>
   The formula for mega-success came from Evanovich's childhood,
marriage and parenting experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up, I was always the little girl who did everything
wrong,'' Evanovich said, grinning. ``I had a vivid imagination. For
three years, I thought I was a horse. And I liked to entertain, to
make people laugh. But in college I majored in fine arts, in
painting, and then I got married and had two kids.''
</P>
<P>
   When Peter and Alexandra were old enough to fend for themselves,
Evanovich decided she didn't really want to be a painter. For 12
years, Evanovich wrote books that no one would publish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept all the rejections in a big crate,'' she said. ``I had
no (writing) skills, and I was teaching myself what to do. I was
lucky that I could get time to write; my husband has a doctorate in
math, he was working for the Navy, and I just kept at it. Then
someone said I should try writing romance novels.''
</P>
<P>
   It worked. Evanovich churned out a dozen romances in five years,
following publisher formulas, winning some romance industry awards
and making decent, though not move-to-the-mountains, money.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I burned out,'' she said. ``I'm from Jersey. I wanted to
try writing something more comfortable for me, something funny. I
decided whatever I wrote would have to be a series of books about
the same people so I could get to know the characters. I got a new
agent and bounced ideas off him. He kept turning them down.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Evanovich saw the movie ``Midnight Run,'' a yarn about
bounty hunters that starred Robert De Niro.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was drawn to the concept,'' she said. ``As a bounty hunter,
my protagonist would have freedom to do lots of funny, interesting
things. She would have to be a woman from Jersey, because that's
like me, but younger, with all the possibilities that would
involve.''
</P>
<P>
   To develop her fictional cast, Evanovich turned to television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always say what I write is `Seinfeld,''' she said. ``My
style of writing is more sitcom than literature. Besides the main
character, you need lots of colorful continuing characters so they
can, in a way, take some of the attention and pressure off the
protagonist.''
</P>
<P>
   As envisioned by Evanovich, Stephanie would be single and
increasingly desperate. Her body would not ripple with the muscles
of an aerobic instructor, either; Stephanie would carry a few extra
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   She would be as likely to shoot herself as to hit any criminal
she aimed at, and the only hand-to-hand combat she could win would
be against midgets. (The best scene in ``High Five.'') Above all,
Stephanie would wisecrack through high-speed chases, sex scenes and
confrontations with her loony crew of compatriots.
</P>
<P>
   Evanovich's agent liked the concept, and so did Scribner, which
bought ``One for the Money'' on the basis of 50 written pages and
an outline for the rest of the book. The first Stephanie Plum
mystery sold respectably, and ``Two for the Dough'' and ``Three to
Get Deadly'' each did a little better.
</P>
<P>
   Then Evanovich moved to St. Martin's Press, believing the new
publisher would put more marketing muscle behind Stephanie Plum's
next printed adventures.
</P>
<P>
   In Evanovich and Stephanie Plum, St. Martin's editors believed
they had an author and a character with the potential to top
bestseller lists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd seen intriguing growth for the first three books,'' said
executive editor Jennifer Enderlin. ``There was something like a 50
percent sales increase each time out. We took on ``Four to Score,''
and it didn't make the ``Times'' top 15, but we did see a 100
percent sales increase.''
</P>
<P>
   The fifth Evanovich/Plum novel, Enderlin believed, would be the
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   During this time, Evanovich's daughter Alex became part of the
marketing mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alex graduated from film and photography school and went to
San Francisco to find a job and live,'' Evanovich said. Mom
supported her daughter financially, and a grateful Alex wanted to
do something in return. She put up a Web site (www.evanovich.com)
to publicize her mother's books.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a couple months I thought, `This is really a good
thing,' '' Evanovich said.
</P>
<P>
   Mom's writing income was sufficient to hire Alex as her
full-time Webmaster. In addition to overseeing the Evanovich home
page, Alex visits mystery fiction chat rooms and invites
participants to www.evanovich.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had 500,000 hits just last week,'' Evanovich said proudly.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site's big job was previewing ``High Five'' in advance
of its publication, in much the same way movie trailers hype
upcoming feature films. When ``High Five'' hit bookstore shelves
four weeks ago, it immediately made every national bestseller list.
Over the course of the next two weeks, it kept moving up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thrilled,'' Enderlin said. ``We believed in Janet, of
course, and in her books. In this industry, you can do all the
right things and still not get the result you expected. With her,
with ``High Five,'' we have.''
</P>
<P>
   For Evanovich, the news just keeps on getting better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tri-Star bought `One for the Money' film rights,'' she said.
``It's in pre-production, and I have no idea when they're going to
make the film, but I got the money from the sale.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Evanovich won't divulge the amount, it was enough so that
her husband could quit his job with the Navy. They have moved from
New Jersey to a small town in New Hampshire. Son Peter, who
previously worked for the U.S. Senate judicial committee, has
joined his sister as Mom's full-time employee, overseeing her new
financial empire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to be together in business as a family,'' Evanovich
said, beaming. ``Alex with the Web site, Peter with the money, my
husband sort of running everything. And I can go into a room and
write and tell myself not to feel guilty, because it's really my
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Evanovich says a new part of her job is keeping a sense of
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to keep the feeling of pleasure in being able to sit
and write every day,'' she said. ``I want to keep on having fun
going on tours, meeting readers who want to say hello, thanking
them for sending me letters and e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't take success too seriously, and I won't because,
like I said, I know I'm still just Mom inside.''

ON HIS 100TH BIRTHDAY, THE MYTH, AND LEGACY, OF ERNEST HEMINGWAY
LIVE ON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ernest Hemingway isn't around to celebrate his 100th birthday
this Wednesday. He didn't quite make it to 62, choosing to kill
himself with a shotgun on July 2, 1961. But all these years later,
Hemingway remains possibly the most celebrated and certainly the
most mythical modern American writer.
</P>
<P>
   The titles of his books are ingrained in American culture _
``For Whom the Bell Tolls,'' ``A Farewell to Arms,'' ``The Sun Also
Rises,'' ``The Old Man and the Sea.'' Once they were mainstream
fiction, and although they remain staples of some high school and
college English class reading lists, more people today may
recognize the titles than have read the books.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Hemingway the celebrity outshines Hemingway the writer.
In the same way modern-day fans follow the adventures of Sean Penn
and Mike Tyson, Hemingway, who would have been 100 years old July
21, is still talked about for his drinking, for his violent temper
and, above all, for killing himself. Three years ago when actress
Margaux Hemingway died from an overdose of phenobarbital, the wire
service story began, ``Like her grandfather before her. ...''
</P>
<P>
   We can deduce Ernest Hemingway had a predilection for suicide;
his father, brother and sister all killed themselves. Yet the same
overpowering emotions that drove him to pull the trigger of a
shotgun in Ketchum, Idaho, also inspired real-life adventures that
evolved into fabulous fiction. The extremes of Hemingway's life,
reiterated in countless stories about him on the occasion of his
100th birthday, proved to be our good luck and his bad fortune.
</P>
<P>
   The complete Hemingway biography can be found in other places.
Full books have focused on small slices of his colorful life, how
his mother dressed him like a girl and had him sleep in her bed;
the four turbulent marriages; the suicide of his father; his love
affairs; his fistfights; and his fascination with bullfighting.
Amid all this personal effluvia, Hemingway the writer has been
gradually forgotten, except to note that he was great and to assume
erroneously that every book he wrote was perfect and all his
writing peers worshipped him.
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway got his writing start as a journalist for the Kansas
City Star. His author-idol was satirist Ring Lardner, but any plans
Hemingway might have had for focusing on journalism were
interrupted by the first World War. The 19-year-old couldn't enlist
because of poor eyesight. He volunteered as a Red Cross ambulance
driver and was wounded in action in Europe. Hemingway's war
adventure would later inspire ``A Farewell to Arms,'' one of his
first great novels.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Hemingway lived in Paris as European
correspondent for the Toronto Star Weekly. There, with the
encouragement of fellow expatriate writers Ezra Pound, James Joyce,
Gertrude Stein and Lincoln Steffens, among others, Hemingway tried
his hand at short stories. With Pound's support, several appeared
in the prestigious Transatlantic Review. In 1926, Hemingway
published ``The Sun Also Rises;'' ``A Farewell to Arms'' followed
in 1929, and by then Ernest Hemingway had established himself as a
top-echelon writer. He remained prominent and controversial for the
rest of his life and for the 38 years that have followed.
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway lived a life of excess. He got publicly drunk in New
York, cheered bullfighters in Spain, divorced his first wife to
marry Vanity Fair reporter Pauline Pfeiffer and settled in Key
West, Fla., where he fished for marlin during breaks from his
writing.
</P>
<P>
   Only his father's 1929 suicide clouded these halcyon days. In
addition to being plagued by physical ailments, Clarence Hemingway
had lost a fortune in failed Florida real-estate deals and shot
himself in the head. Ernest was summoned home to organize the
funeral. There is no way to know how the manner of his father's
death affected him, but we do know he stopped writing novels for a
long time.
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway spent most of the 1930s crafting nonfiction and short
stories. ``Death in the Afternoon,'' his paean to bullfighting,
solidified what would become recognized as the inimitable Hemingway
style of writing _ simple yet lyrical, glorifying courage in the
face of danger, often including the author as a character, or at
least a thinly disguised ``alter ego.''
</P>
<P>
   James Joyce wrote that Hemmingway ``has reduced the veil between
literature and life, which is what every writer strives to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hemingway didn't get it right all the time. Occasionally his
prejudices or bad temper got in the way.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, Thomas Wolfe created more complex word mosaics;
William Faulkner probably created a better sense of place; and John
Steinbeck could evoke understanding or pity where Hemingway would
have disdained even trying.
</P>
<P>
   But Hemingway could get to the heart of a story better than
anyone else. He likened his stories to an iceberg, with only
one-eighth of the whole visible, but each of his characters had
unmistakable purpose. They brought readers into the action as
participants rather than observers. From lusty sex scenes to
hard-bitten combat, Hemingway never averted his gaze and wouldn't
let his readers look away, either.
</P>
<P>
   The subsequent generation of American writers noticed. Norman
Mailer's roughshod World War II classic ``The Naked and the Dead''
particularly echoes the Hemingway literary legacy. Even current
writers with disparate styles, like Gore Vidal and George Plimpton,
have acknowledged learning some of their craft by studying
Hemingway.
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway liked to think of himself as a teacher and believed he
was qualified to lecture anyone on writing, bullfighting, shooting,
fishing, sex and prize fighting. When he learned Plimpton was to
box light-heavyweight champion Archie Moore for a Sports
Illustrated story, he invited Plimpton to lunch at a ritzy
restaurant and, between courses, made Plimpton stand up and fight
him.
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway then demonstrated how to throw a left hook by bouncing
a hard one off Plimpton's skull. Nearby diners applauded nervously.
Hemingway stopped clouting Plimpton only when the bloodied writer
asked him to throw punches in slow motion so Plimpton could study
his technique.
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway's relationship with male authors who might be
considered his peers was always tenuous. He got angry with them for
slights both real and imagined, and with Faulkner in particular. &QL;

 PONDERING HOW MUSIC ON THE INTERNET WILL PLAY IN THE MARKET  (jw) 
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ The bands cracking the Top 10 music chart
this week are Red Delicious and the Streaming Geeks. No, the hit
list is not the Billboard Top 40, but one from Mp3.com, an
unconventional force in the music industry that is scheduled to
make an initial public offering of stock this week.
</P>
<P>
   Mp3.com, a Web site named for a technology used to compress
music, offers a library of 100,000 songs from 18,000 musicians,
virtually all small-time and unsigned by record labels. Visitors to
the site can listen to the music in real time or download the songs
free to be played later on a computer or portable digital device,
which is expected to be a hot item this holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   But will Mp3.com be just a one-day wonder or a long-term play
for investors? No matter how great the stock's first-day rise, the
company must find a way to turn its millions of visitors into
revenue if it is to avoid being shelved like an eight-track tape.
</P>
<P>
   The pre-IPO buzz is akin to the din before a Bruce Springsteen
concert in New Jersey. When Mp3.com filed with regulators in May,
the company said it intended to sell 9 million shares at $10 to $12
apiece. But on July 12 it raised the offering to 12.3 million
shares at $16 to $18.
</P>
<P>
   Final pricing is tentatively scheduled from the lead underwriter
Credit Suisse First Boston for Tuesday night with trading to begin
Wednesday. At the low end of the expected range, the company would
be valued at $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Between the time it initially filed and amended its offering,
two other digital music companies went public amid a frenzy for all
things Internet. Liquid Audio, maker of software to download music
from the Net, more than doubled on its first day of trading on July
9, and Musicmaker, which lets visitors compile their own CD's from
an online library of songs, rose 71 percent its first day of
trading on July 7, though it has since given back much of that
gain.
</P>
<P>
   And the coming offering has more name recognition. Mp3.com is
the de facto technical standard for compressing music into
computer-friendly audio files, although it can be used by anybody
and is not singular to the Web site. ``They are the Kleenex of
digital music,'' said Kathleen Smith, portfolio manager for the
Renaissance Capital IPO Fund. ``There is a lot of interest in this
offering.''
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the progressive and populist movements that are
central to the Internet, Mp3 has helped create an outlet for music
that was not previously accessible or broadcast to the masses. The
site includes not only aspiring commercial artists, but church
choirs, garage bands and seemingly every genre of music.
</P>
<P>
   Its outspoken founder, Michael Robertson, has clashed with the
record industry and defended the MP3 audio format, which can be
used to pirate music, as a way of breaking the hold that record
companies have over the distribution of commercial music.
Certainly, the traffic on Mp3 reinforces his position; the site
averages 325,000 visitors a day, according to filings with the
Security and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   But MP3 is emblematic of the Net in one other way. Its business
model is unformed, or at least unproved. For now, the company is
banking mostly on advertising, which for the three months ended
March 31 accounted for 84 percent of revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Mp3.com generated $1.2 million in revenue last year and $666,000
in the quarter ended March 31. The operating losses for those
periods were $220,000 and $1.5 million, respectively. Big
expenditures have been made for the offering and to expand. The
company has grown from eight employees in December to 54 in March
and 141 on June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the company foresees revenue from promotional
activities and sales. But last year, it had revenue of only
$100,000 from sales of compact disks, and $106,000 from such sales
in the first three months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've done a tremendous job of building a site, but the
business model today is not that interesting,'' said Mark
Mooradian, a senior analyst with Jupiter Communications, a market
research firm in New York. ``Mp3.com is all about what they do
next.''
</P>
<P>
   One nagging question, he said, is whether music fans will
continue to flock to a site offering no-name bands when the major
record labels start selling music on line, as is expected late this
year. People ``don't want to listen to Billy Bob and his banjo
playing performance art,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mooradian expects a big first day of trading because of
the Mp3.com name recognition and says he, too, is bullish if the
company can figure out how to capitalize on the traffic.
</P>
<P>
   A prominent outsider is betting it can. The company disclosed
last week in its amended filing with the SEC that it had signed a
$150 million, three-year advertising deal with Groupe Arnaut, a
French conglomerate of luxury goods like Christian Dior and Moet &AMP;
Chandon. Under that deal, Groupe Arnaut will buy 5 percent of the
company at the initial public offering price.
</P>
<P>
   Other major shareholders include Robertson, 32, who owns 25.6
million shares representing 39 percent of the company after the
offering. The venture capital firm Sequoia Capital owns 9.3 million
shares, or 14.2 percent, while David Easterly, president of Cox
Interactive Media, owns 6.2 million shares, or 9.5 percent,
according to regulatory filings.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Hause, an industry analyst in Mountain View, Calif., for
the research firm IDC in Framingham, Mass., wonders about the
long-term viability of Mp3.com's advertising model, but considers
the site a possible acquisition candidate. The Internet Underground
Music Archive, a competitor with only 4,000 artists, was recently
acquired by Emusic.com for $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The expected valuation of Mp3.com will raise the bar much
higher. ``It would be a natural for a company like Yahoo to
acquire,'' Hause said, ``assuming its valuation isn't too high.''

UNDATED: xxx in particular. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1947, Faulkner gave a series of talks at the University of
Mississippi. At one point, he was asked to name the finest current
writers and nominated Wolfe, John Dos Passos, Steinbeck and
Hemingway, with female author Willa Cather. Modestly, he added his
own name. Faulkner then noted that all of them, himself included,
had ``failed to achieve the dream of perfection.'' Of Hemingway,
Faulkner said, ``(He) has no courage, has never climbed out on a
limb. He has never used a word where the reader might check his
usage by a dictionary.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Faulkner, the university chose to distribute a
press release that included those remarks. Hemingway read the
comments in a New York newspaper. Stung, he asked a military friend
to write to Faulkner about Hemingway's heroism in combat.
Obviously, Hemingway never considered that Faulkner might have been
challenging his courage as a writer rather than as a man.
</P>
<P>
   Faulkner informed Hemingway that he had never doubted his
courage in combat, but his apology did not include backing down
from his evaluation of Hemingway as an author. Apparently, that
meant less to Hemingway than any imagined impugning of his
battlefield honor.
</P>
<P>
   Critics didn't always love Hemingway, either. After borrowing
money to finance his first African safari in 1933, the book that
resulted, ``Green Hills of Africa,'' was lambasted for too much
bluster and too little literary merit.
</P>
<P>
   War had given Hemingway his first adventures to spin into
literary gold, and war helped revive his reputation. In 1937,
Hemingway went to Spain to cover the Spanish Civil War for the
North American Newspaper Alliance. His wife supported the fascists;
Hemingway's heart was with the communists. This was a handy excuse
to divorce his second wife, Pfeiffer, and marry writer Martha
Gellhorn, with whom he had been conducting a long-term affair.
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway used his time in Spain as the basis of ``For Whom the
Bell Tolls,'' which was a unanimous selection as the best novel of
1940 by the Pulitzer Prize committee. Hemingway never got that
Pulitzer; it was vetoed by competition overseers because the book
was too political.
</P>
<P>
   It was 10 years before Hemingway published another novel,
``Across the River and Into the Trees.'' World War II, during which
he served again as a correspondent, booted Hemingway out of his
writing torpor. Hemingway also followed his old pattern of falling
in love. Mary Welsh replaced Martha Gellhorn, although divorce
would wait until 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway attached himself to the Allied forces in Europe and
was in Paris when the city was liberated in August 1944. He loved
it all and intended to write a great novel based on the experience.
But ``Across the River and Into the Trees'' paled beside ``A
Farewell to Arms.''
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway did not take this well. He regarded writing as a
competitive sport. Writers who got better reviews had, in a sense,
defeated him. And a decade had passed since ``For Whom the Bell
Tolls'' earned him accolades. Hemingway retreated to Cuba with Mary
Welsh and the goal of writing a book so great that it would
reaffirm him as the best writer of his day.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, ``The Old Man and the Sea,'' an extremely short novel
or very long short story, was first published in Life magazine.
That issue sold more than 5 million copies. Scribner published the
book in hardcover, and its first printing of 50,000 copies sold out
in days. It was Hemingway writing at his best, with spare, haunting
descriptions of an old man on the ocean fighting to bring in a
mighty game fish.
</P>
<P>
   Several critics called it ``the perfect book,'' and it earned
him the Pulitzer Prize. Book sales and film rights made him wealthy
enough to afford African safaris.
</P>
<P>
   One of these forays almost killed him in 1954. A plane crash in
Uganda left Hemingway with a fractured skull; cracked discs in his
spine; a ruptured liver, kidney and spleen; dislocated right
shoulder; and facial burns. In October, when he was awarded the
Nobel Prize in literature, which is based on cumulative work rather
than any single work, his injuries prevented him from traveling to
Sweden for the award ceremony. Instead, he wrote some remarks that
were read by the U.S. ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   By now, Hemingway was in deteriorating health, and it affected
his writing. The flow, the lyrical elegance, was missing, and he
never completely got it back.
</P>
<P>
   A three-part series on bullfighting for Life magazine in 1960
was the final work published while Hemingway was alive. The writing
wasn't bad, but it wasn't worthy of Hemingway. He knew it, and he
drowned his frustration in whiskey. In 1960, Ernest and Mary
Hemingway moved to Ketchum. Their new hometown was small enough for
the writer to avoid the spotlight he had enjoyed for so much of his
life. Now physically depleted and mentally exhausted, Hemingway
didn't want the attention.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by his wife, Hemingway entered the Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, Minn., and underwent a dozen electroshock treatments for
depression. The treatments dulled his memory, which in turn reduced
his already deteriorating ability to write.
</P>
<P>
   He came home and threatened suicide. In his last days, Hemingway
imagined he was surrounded by enemies. On July 2, 1961, he loaded a
shotgun and shot himself in the head.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of Hemingway's literary success _ from the late 1920s
to the early '50s _ came in an American era when colorful writers
could become celebrities on the same aggrandized level as athletes,
singers and movie stars. Faulkner, Steinbeck, Dorothy Parker and
others joined Hemingway as household names.
</P>
<P>
   In those pre-television days, their personal lives made almost
as many headlines as the reviews of books or stories they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Boozing, brawling, womanizing, death-defying macho man Ernest
Hemingway seemed to epitomize his own writing, a tough-tender
literary blend reminiscent of Humphrey Bogart's on-screen persona
in ``Casablanca'' or ``The African Queen.'' The manner of
Hemingway's death reinforced his reputation; it seemed eerily
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the Hemingway myth has grown through the years. Hemingway
WAS a master, and his best work remains mesmerizing. The layering
within paragraphs of simple, direct sentences, the characters
sketched as much by action as adjectives and the sense of a strong
story told boldly and directly has not been equaled by any modern
American writer.
</P>
<P>
   His spirit is with us still in modern novels, though the writers
may not realize Hemingway's earthy themes opened doors for them.
Who knows? It's possible Oonya Kempadoo's graphic sex scenes in
``Buxton Spice'' and Larry McMurtry's casual violence in any of the
``Lonesome Dove'' series might not have passed muster with
publishers if Ernest Hemingway hadn't proved you can write crudely
and well at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   On the occasion of his 100th birthday, it is appropriate to
start measuring Ernest Hemingway again by what he wrote, not how he
died. As Maxwell Perkins said of Hemingway after ``For Whom the
Bell Tolls,'' ``if the function of a writer is to reveal reality,
no one ever so completely performed it.''

SHE'S GOT CELEBRITY STATUS, BUT AT HEART, JANET EVANOVICH IS STILL
`MOM'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many women put their dreams on hold until the kids are grown and
off to college. Janet Evanovich, for example, decides to write a
book like she always wanted and keeps on writing until one is
published.
</P>
<P>
   Then she strikes gold. One book becomes a bestseller, and
eventually another makes it to the top of all the major bestseller
lists, among them The New York Times. She sells the rights to
Hollywood, and Mom becomes a celebrity author. She and Dad move to
the mountains and live happily ever after.
</P>
<P>
   The odds against this dream coming true defy calculation, and
yet it just happened to the 56-year-old Evanovich. ``High Five''
(St. Martin's, $23.95), her fifth book in a mystery/comedy series
featuring New Jersey bounty hunter Stephanie Plum, has reached the
Times fiction list and, at least for one week, toppled Thomas
Harris' ``Hannibal'' from No. 1 in Tarrant County.
</P>
<P>
   So Evanovich, stopping at the Star-Telegram last week during a
national tour promoting ``High Five,'' was asked for her reaction.
Screams of glee seemed appropriate, tears of joy even better.
</P>
<P>
   Evanovich thought, thought some more, and finally said, ``I
can't relate to the celebrity author image; I'm still Mom inside.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Mom, however, who created Stephanie Plum, a klutzy
heroine who, despite her own bumblings and those of a colorful,
quirky supporting cast, always manages to track down the bad guys.
It took six years and five printed adventures before Stephanie
joined Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta and Sue Grafton's Kinsey
Millhone among the upper ranks of fictional sleuth stars.
</P>
<P>
   The formula for mega-success came from Evanovich's childhood,
marriage and parenting experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up, I was always the little girl who did everything
wrong,'' Evanovich said, grinning. ``I had a vivid imagination. For
three years, I thought I was a horse. And I liked to entertain, to
make people laugh. But in college I majored in fine arts, in
painting, and then I got married and had two kids.''
</P>
<P>
   When Peter and Alexandra were old enough to fend for themselves,
Evanovich decided she didn't really want to be a painter. For 12
years, Evanovich wrote books that no one would publish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept all the rejections in a big crate,'' she said. ``I had
no (writing) skills, and I was teaching myself what to do. I was
lucky that I could get time to write; my husband has a doctorate in
math, he was working for the Navy, and I just kept at it. Then
someone said I should try writing romance novels.''
</P>
<P>
   It worked. Evanovich churned out a dozen romances in five years,
following publisher formulas, winning some romance industry awards
and making decent, though not move-to-the-mountains, money.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I burned out,'' she said. ``I'm from Jersey. I wanted to
try writing something more comfortable for me, something funny. I
decided whatever I wrote would have to be a series of books about
the same people so I could get to know the characters. I got a new
agent and bounced ideas off him. He kept turning them down.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Evanovich saw the movie ``Midnight Run,'' a yarn about
bounty hunters that starred Robert De Niro.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was drawn to the concept,'' she said. ``As a bounty hunter,
my protagonist would have freedom to do lots of funny, interesting
things. She would have to be a woman from Jersey, because that's
like me, but younger, with all the possibilities that would
involve.''
</P>
<P>
   To develop her fictional cast, Evanovich turned to television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always say what I write is `Seinfeld,''' she said. ``My
style of writing is more sitcom than literature. Besides the main
character, you need lots of colorful continuing characters so they
can, in a way, take some of the attention and pressure off the
protagonist.''
</P>
<P>
   As envisioned by Evanovich, Stephanie would be single and
increasingly desperate. Her body would not ripple with the muscles
of an aerobic instructor, either; Stephanie would carry a few extra
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   She would be as likely to shoot herself as to hit any criminal
she aimed at, and the only hand-to-hand combat she could win would
be against midgets. (The best scene in ``High Five.'') Above all,
Stephanie would wisecrack through high-speed chases, sex scenes and
confrontations with her loony crew of compatriots.
</P>
<P>
   Evanovich's agent liked the concept, and so did Scribner, which
bought ``One for the Money'' on the basis of 50 written pages and
an outline for the rest of the book. The first Stephanie Plum
mystery sold respectably, and ``Two for the Dough'' and ``Three to
Get Deadly'' each did a little better.
</P>
<P>
   Then Evanovich moved to St. Martin's Press, believing the new
publisher would put more marketing muscle behind Stephanie Plum's
next printed adventures.
</P>
<P>
   In Evanovich and Stephanie Plum, St. Martin's editors believed
they had an author and a character with the potential to top
bestseller lists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd seen intriguing growth for the first three books,'' said
executive editor Jennifer Enderlin. ``There was something like a 50
percent sales increase each time out. We took on ``Four to Score,''
and it didn't make the ``Times'' top 15, but we did see a 100
percent sales increase.''
</P>
<P>
   The fifth Evanovich/Plum novel, Enderlin believed, would be the
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   During this time, Evanovich's daughter Alex became part of the
marketing mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alex graduated from film and photography school and went to
San Francisco to find a job and live,'' Evanovich said. Mom
supported her daughter financially, and a grateful Alex wanted to
do something in return. She put up a Web site (www.evanovich.com)
to publicize her mother's books.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a couple months I thought, `This is really a good
thing,' '' Evanovich said.
</P>
<P>
   Mom's writing income was sufficient to hire Alex as her
full-time Webmaster. In addition to overseeing the Evanovich home
page, Alex visits mystery fiction chat rooms and invites
participants to www.evanovich.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had 500,000 hits just last week,'' Evanovich said proudly.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site's big job was previewing ``High Five'' in advance
of its publication, in much the same way movie trailers hype
upcoming feature films. When ``High Five'' hit bookstore shelves
four weeks ago, it immediately made every national bestseller list.
Over the course of the next two weeks, it kept moving up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thrilled,'' Enderlin said. ``We believed in Janet, of
course, and in her books. In this industry, you can do all the
right things and still not get the result you expected. With her,
with ``High Five,'' we have.''
</P>
<P>
   For Evanovich, the news just keeps on getting better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tri-Star bought `One for the Money' film rights,'' she said.
``It's in pre-production, and I have no idea when they're going to
make the film, but I got the money from the sale.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Evanovich won't divulge the amount, it was enough so that
her husband could quit his job with the Navy. They have moved from
New Jersey to a small town in New Hampshire. Son Peter, who
previously worked for the U.S. Senate judicial committee, has
joined his sister as Mom's full-time employee, overseeing her new
financial empire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to be together in business as a family,'' Evanovich
said, beaming. ``Alex with the Web site, Peter with the money, my
husband sort of running everything. And I can go into a room and
write and tell myself not to feel guilty, because it's really my
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Evanovich says a new part of her job is keeping a sense of
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to keep the feeling of pleasure in being able to sit
and write every day,'' she said. ``I want to keep on having fun
going on tours, meeting readers who want to say hello, thanking
them for sending me letters and e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't take success too seriously, and I won't because,
like I said, I know I'm still just Mom inside.''

 &HT;    Qwest buy makes it peer with BellSouth
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With its blockbuster deal to buy U S West, Qwest
Communications _ which had only just become BellSouth Corp.'s
junior partner _ is now poised to become a peer.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest, which Sunday announced the $40.5 billion purchase of the
Denver-based regional phone company, has always been ambitious.
Assuming the purchase is completed, Denver-based Qwest and
hard-charging Chief Executive Joe Nacchio will emerge with annual
revenue of $18.5 billion and a stock value of about $65 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement, aimed at combining U S West's local service
with Qwest's long-distance, high-speed lines, came less than two
months after $23 billion-a-year BellSouth plunked down $3.5 billion
to buy 10 percent of Qwest. During a teleconference Monday, Nacchio
indicated BellSouth has played little part in backstage maneuvers
leading to the deal, although its money sweetened his offer to U S
West. BellSouth's investment _ which has lost about $1 billion in
value as Qwest stock swooned _ will be worth only 3.5 percent of
the combined company.
</P>
<P>
   Through spokesman Jeff Battcher, BellSouth shrugged off the
Qwest coup. ``It doesn't really change anything for us.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the company will consider raising its stake back to 10
percent, the ceiling for investment in a long-distance company
until BellSouth itself is permitted into long-distance. Yet that 10
percent barrier is somewhat illusory. U S West faces the same
restriction, but Qwest has agreed to forswear long-distance in U S
West's region as part of its purchase _ and could have done the
same for BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth, traditionally a conservative company, preferred a
more modest investment that would still allow cooperation with
Qwest in selling services. While BellSouth saw that investment as a
way to gain significant influence on a much smaller company, it
held open the possibility of swallowing all of Qwest.
</P>
<P>
   But suddenly the dynamics of such a deal _ and the price of such
a purchase _ look vastly different.
</P>
<P>
   ``BellSouth has hinted that it would like to increase the share
it owns,'' said Mel Marten, analyst with Edward Jones &AMP; Co. ``Only
now, it is more likely that if there were a merger, Qwest would be
buying BellSouth rather than the other way around.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps souring the Qwest deal still further is knowledge that
BellSouth has long scorned U S West as a partner. Now, any marriage
with Qwest would be a menage a trois with U S West.
</P>
<P>
   Yet BellSouth will still need high-speed, long-distance lines,
said Marc Bacurin, analyst with J.C. Bradford. He suggested that
BellSouth could invest in other long-distance carriers. But
ultimately, BellSouth ought to want ownership of that network, he
said. ``I have to think that the people at BellSouth are unhappy
about this transaction. Qwest has their management team with their
own agenda.''

ELF AQUITAINE TURNS TABLES IN HOSTILE TAKEOVER BID 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Reviving the ``Pac-Man'' defense against
hostile takeovers _ gobble up the company that wants to gobble up
you, the big French oil company Elf Aquitaine SA made a $50 billion
counteroffer Monday for the rival Total Fina SA.
</P>
<P>
   The move came two weeks after Total Fina stunned Elf Aquitaine
with a hostile bid worth about $43 billion. It was also another
reminder that the clubby world of Europe's corporate elite is
becoming as combative and unpredictable as that in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time a corporate prey has sought to buy its
attacker in France, which is now in the middle of two major
takeover battles. The five-month fight between the nation's three
biggest banks _ Banque Nationale de Paris, Societe Generale and
Paribas _ will come to a head in the next few weeks as shareholders
vote on two competing merger plans.
</P>
<P>
   French political leaders tried and failed to broker a compromise
between the banks. Now the government must decide if it wants to
make a similar attempt with the two big oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were far from enthusiastic, in part because Elf
Aquitaine's bid almost guarantees a protracted battle.
</P>
<P>
   Its shares dropped 1.4 percent Monday to 173.50 euros ($178.60),
while those of Total Fina declined half a euro to 131.80 euros, or
$135.67.
</P>
<P>
   Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn said previously that he
had no interest in blocking Total's offer. He also made clear that
his biggest concern was keeping Elf Aquitaine under French
ownership, which would be true regardless of who wins this fight.
</P>
<P>
   People close to Elf Aquitaine said the company had investigated
possible ``white knight'' defenses, including an alliance with ENI,
the Italian energy-based conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   But a deal with any company except Total Fina would have raised
sensitive questions about foreign control. Indeed, the Italian
government still owns 38 percent of ENI.
</P>
<P>
   Though dramatic, Elf Aquitaine's counteroffer for Total Fina was
not a surprise. Philippe Jaffre, Elf Aquitaine's chairman, had
already made clear that he would fight a Total Fina takeover, and
he had assembled a group of American and European investment banks
to plot the defense.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal proposed Monday, Elf Aquitaine would offer three
of its shares and 190 euros ($195.59) in cash for every five shares
of Total Fina. That translated to roughly 142 euros a share, an 8
percent premium over Total Fina's price on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In their structure, the only real difference between the Elf
Aquitaine and Total Fina plans is that Elf would spin off the
chemical operations of both companies, which have combined sales
around $15 billion, as a separately listed company. Stockholders
would get one share of the new chemical company for each share they
owned in the combined oil company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that Total Fina's unwelcome offer both undervalues
the contribution of Elf shareholders to the combination and misses
the opportunity,'' Jaffre of Elf Aquitaine said at a news
conference in Paris Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Jaffre said he could achieve more than twice the cost savings
promised by Total Fina's chairman, Thierry Desmarest: $2.5 billion
vs. $1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But some money managers were skeptical about the proposed
benefits. ``I am not convinced about the new program,'' said
Barbara Regga, portfolio manager at Deutsche Bank's DWS Energy
Fund, which owns shares of both oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   Elf Aquitaine is also trying to fight Total Fina by re-arranging
its statistics. Traditionally, Elf has been very conservative in
measuring its total reserves. Monday, though, Jaffre argued that
the reserves were understated and that Total Fina would therefore
be acquiring them at an unreasonably low price. Using estimates
that Elf Aquitaine said were closer to industry norms, it put its
reserves at 4.6 billion barrels of oil, up from 3.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the sparring over numbers reflects how close the
two deals really are. Many analysts think that Total Fina will
sweeten its bid, but they said the company did not need to do much
to stay ahead.
</P>
<P>
   If the battle goes to the shareholders, it may come down to
their perceptions of the dueling chief executives. Jaffre, 54, is a
graduate of some of France's best schools. He spent part of his
early career at the Finance Ministry and later ran the big bank
Credit Agricole. He was put in charge of Elf Aquitaine in 1993 and
oversaw its privatization.
</P>
<P>
   Jaffre has pushed hard to reduce costs over the last few years,
and he has streamlined the company by selling businesses outside
the core oil and natural gas areas.
</P>
<P>
   Desmarest, 53, of Total Fina, is also a product of top French
schools, and has spent most of his career in the oil industry.
After taking over what was then called Total SA in 1995, Desmarest
quickly demonstrated his boldness by making deals with Iran to
develop its oil fields. The deals infuriated the United States,
which is still trying to block investment in Iran, but they have
turned out to be profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Desmarest expanded his reach by negotiating a
deal to acquire the Belgian oil company and refiner, Petrofina SA.
The two companies had just completed their exchange of shares when
Desmarest announced the unsolicited offer for Elf Aquitaine.
</P>
<P>
   The new battle is a bonanza for investment banks, most of them
American. Elf Aquitaine's advisers are Goldman, Sachs, Banque
Nationale de Paris, Morgan Stanley, Lazard Freres and Credit
Agricole Indosuez. Total Fina's advisers are Credit Suisse First
Boston, Merrill Lynch and Paribas.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Times have changed since John Fitzgerald Kennedy led America in
the early Sixties. Back then it was possible for a U.S. president
to keep his sexual peccadilloes completely secret.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton, who has himself milked the Kennedy myth in order
to gain power, was unable to keep a lid on his own infidelities.
</P>
<P>
   But while this speaks volumes about the degree to which the
media now reports on the private lives of public figures, it also
says much about how unwilling we all are to let the facts get in
the way of a good myth.
</P>
<P>
   It has become a truism that the United States of America (and
for that, as usual, read the Western World) lost its innocence on
the day that John F. Kennedy was assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind this feeling was that even the man who embodied
decency and hope for everyone could be wiped out by the forces of
evil.
</P>
<P>
   While it has since emerged that this man was far from being an
embodiment of goodness, the eternal flame still burns in his
memory, in much the same way as revelations about Bill Clinton's
personal life have done nothing to derail his own presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The late John Kennedy, Jr., though, did not approve of the
Monica Lewinsky affair, and berated Clinton in the pages of his
glossy political magazine, George. He did not have much sympathy,
either, for his cousins Joe and Michael, whom he described as
``poster boys for bad behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   It is safe to assume that John Kennedy, Jr. did not admire
patriarch Joseph Kennedy's modus operandi, which has guided the
rest of his family, either: ``It doesn't matter what you are. It
only matters what people think you are.''
</P>
<P>
   So the fact that his sudden, early death has placed him back at
the center of the Kennedy myth, which his ruthless grandfather
created, is a cause for sadness in itself.
</P>
<P>
   John Kennedy, Jr. had set himself against that myth, but now he
has been swallowed up by it. It doesn't matter what he was anymore;
it only matters what people thought he could have been.
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago he was the editor of a magazine that nobody
really rated much; today he is the Kennedy who could have restored
America's faith in the myth, had it not been for the curse that
dogs his family.
</P>
<P>
   He would, we are now told, have run for public office, and
inevitably have become the perfect King of Camelot that America
yearns for.
</P>
<P>
   While no one is yet speculating on whether young Kennedy really
would have been able to take up the mantle, and become a political
leader who was the person he presented himself to be _ a man
devoted to public service as well as to wife and family _ plenty of
other things are being dredged up.
</P>
<P>
   As I write, the bodies of Kennedy and those of his wife and
sister-in-law have not been found. They may never be recovered, but
surely we could have waited a little longer before trotting out
pages of warmed-over gossip about the Kennedy dynasty, particularly
about John Kennedy Jr.'s love life.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't it a little early to read anything much into the fact that
while the father had an affair with Marilyn Monroe, the son had an
affair with Madonna, who has been known to dress up like Marilyn
Monroe (and then told the world that he wasn't a very exciting
lover)?
</P>
<P>
   Or is it some measure of our sophistication that while it took
many years for the Monroe gossip to become acknowledged fact, the
entire history of John Jr.'s sexual life can be reproduced around
the world within 24 hours of his death?
</P>
<P>
   Is this what loss of innocence amounts to? An obsession with
sexual gossip, which floats around in the ether _ meaningless,
irrelevant, unshackled from value judgement _ simply entertaining,
even in the face of tragedy?
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, by all accounts, was himself obsessed with sexual
gossip, and his magazine was an odd amalgam of politics and
glamour.
</P>
<P>
   In his death he has become his own magazine's perfect story, but
it is hard to believe that the next issue will be illustrated with
pictures of Daryl Hannah, Julia Roberts and all the other famous
women with whom he had been linked. For it is here, in the sexual
scandals of the Kennedys, that myth and reality become blurred in a
manner that is unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   And it is this compound myth _ whereby we have all simply fed
the truth into the lies, and decided that it is possible for a
perfect president also to be a liar and a cheat _ that should be
laid to rest alongside poor John Kennedy, Jr. and his wife and
sister-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   Several commentators, after the initial outpouring of the same
old story, have pointed out what should have been obvious all
along: the Kennedys are not cursed. They are, instead, reckless
thrill-seekers.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Onassis clearly knew this, which is why she made her son
promise not to fly. Like any sensible mother she knew her boy, and
knew he did not have the temperament for it.
</P>
<P>
   Curses don't make people kill presidents or presidential
candidates. Curses don't make people drink and drive, crash cars,
play risky games on skis or take heroin.
</P>
<P>
   The myth of the Kennedy curse should die with John, Jr. &QL;

LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL FOR YOUNG COUPLE, EVEN WHEN ONE MAY NOT HAVE MUCH
TIME LEFT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By MARY ROGERS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   She perches on the edge of the hospital bed, her sandaled feet
dangling above the polished floor. Her toenails are painted a
bright red, and there's a small cross tattooed on the inside of her
right ankle.
</P>
<P>
   She has come from work at an insurance company wearing denim
trousers and a T-shirt. A silver charm bracelet jangles on her
wrist. She is animated and smiling as she turns the pages of the
scrapbook.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband of three years sits beside her. His brown hair is
mussed from the pillows and he breathes with the help of oxygen
pumped from a bottle beside the bed. His cheeks are flushed with
fever and he coughs often, a thick, choking sound that punctuates
their days.
</P>
<P>
   The scrapbook is her favorite color, red, and on the rough
sheets she has glued a hundred reminders of their life together.
Holly Reynolds Smith, 22, hasn't left out a thing: not the good
times, not the bad times.
</P>
<P>
   This scrapbook might chronicle a thousand marriages. It is the
story of Everyman's small pleasures and stinging regrets.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a unique record of the ebb and flow of Holly and Jeff
Smith's time together, a volume filled with a poignant hope for a
future they may never know.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff has cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease that attacks the
respiratory and digestive systems. The disorder has invaded his
pancreas, leaving him an insulin-dependent diabetic, and filled his
lungs with a gooey mucus.
</P>
<P>
   He won't be 25 until September, but he has already shrunk a full
inch since high school, and after recent days in the hospital, he
has gained weight but still tips the scales at only 111 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   In a last-ditch effort to save his life, doctors have
recommended a lung transplant. He has been on the list since
February _ and may not find the right donor match in time. Jeff
believes he can survive only a little more than a year without a
transplant, but even new lungs won't guarantee a new life. So many
things can go wrong. Rejection. Infection. Hemorrhage.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff knows the dangers, but he doesn't dwell on them. Every day,
he thanks God for giving him one more day. Every day, Holly prays
for more time with Jeff.
</P>
<P>
   She is, she says, supremely happy, but she is also very candid
about life with her husband. It's a life she chose willingly, one
she'd choose again, but it's tough, very tough _ harder than she
ever imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Keenly aware of their own mortality, they have grown old before
their time _ but it wasn't always so. ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   On the first page of the scrapbook there's a snapshot of Holly
and Jeff. He's wearing cut-off jeans and a ball cap. She's got on
shorts and hiking boots. His arm is around her shoulders. In the
upper left-hand corner of the page there's a ticket stub from a
Neil Young concert at Dallas' Coca-Cola Starplex _ Sept. 19, 1993 _
the day they met.
</P>
<P>
   It was the eve of her 17th birthday. Jeff was tan, attractive,
what she called a ``hotty'' who owned a 10-year-old Mustang
convertible and knew how to savor every moment. She was
effervescent, optimistic and smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced by mutual friends, they were drawn to each other
immediately, but Holly was involved with someone else. In no time,
Jeff made that duo a trio, and for almost a year the three went
everywhere together. The mall. Concerts. Ball games.
</P>
<P>
   Soon Holly and Jeff began palling around alone like longtime
friends. When Jeff looked at Holly and their friend together, it
was not jealousy he felt, but a sense of wonder and maybe envy that
his friend could be so lucky. Holly was so easy to be with, so much
fun.
</P>
<P>
   They knew their relationship was changing, but still they had no
``real'' date. Once when she went to Indiana, he told her to think
of him at twilight. ``You look south and I'll look north. Look up
and I'll be there,'' he said. It is the sort of secret code used by
lovers worldwide, a romantic reminder that each is always in the
other's thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, Jeff and Holly whisper those words _ often when she
leaves the hospital. ``Look up and I'll be there.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 4, 1994, they joined crowds of people gathered on Fort
Worth's Trinity River levee to watch the annual fireworks display.
Holly and Jeff sat on the grass, watching the rockets explode in
star bursts. It was their first date, and they knew that from that
night on, everything would be different.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff was amazingly healthy for someone who had struggled his
entire life with CF, so their summer passed in a happy blur of
volleyball, shows and dinners at Wild Bill's Bar-B-Q, where Jeff
held a job.
</P>
<P>
   Holly and Jeff had grown up in the Mid-Cities area of North
Texas, a cluster of communities sandwiched between Fort Worth and
Dallas. They moved easily back and forth across the invisible city
lines that divide North Richland Hills from Keller or Hurst or
Haltom City. All summer, they happily prowled that district and
thought nothing of driving to Fort Worth or Dallas or even Oklahoma
for a concert. ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Jeff sold his Mustang and put all the money down on a white Ford
Splash pickup. When he'd pick Holly up for a date, he'd leave a
single red rose or a daisy in the passenger seat for her to find.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote poetry filled with romantic images and for the first
time began to take an interest in his treatment. Until then, he'd
often missed his clinic appointments and had been cavalier about
his health unless the disease demanded attention.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff decided to trust Holly with his biggest confidence. He
resolved to tell her face to face that he had cystic fibrosis. His
friends knew, of course, but Jeff had never actually TOLD anyone he
had the fatal disease. He practiced the words he would use.
</P>
<P>
   That night they drove to a grassy field. A summer sky bloomed
above them. They sat on the tailgate of the pickup. He was
trembling when he turned to face her. ``I've got something to tell
you,'' he said. ``I have cystic fibrosis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know,'' she said. ``It doesn't matter. Not to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff was relieved, giddy with happiness. For him the greatest
obstacle had been bridged. For the first time, he entertained the
idea of a ``normal'' life with a partner, a soul mate who
understood without explanation, who loved without reservation. ___ &QC;

</P>
<P>
   Then in October of 1994, the disease struck with a vengeance,
sending Jeff for a long hospital stay and an even longer period of
recovery. Holly was shaken and as he grew sicker, she pulled away.
She wouldn't go to see him, wouldn't return his phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew about CF, but I guess I just didn't realize until then
how serious it is _ how it can be fatal at such a young age,'' she
says now, sitting beside him on the hospital bed.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff was frustrated and angry. ``I thought we'd worked through
all that,'' he says now. ``I tried to understand, but I just saw
her trying to bail out of this relationship. I was mad _ mad at the
disease, mad at myself, mad at Holly. It took awhile for us to get
it back together.''
</P>
<P>
   They worked through the problems and by March 1995 they were
talking of marriage. They bought a diamond ring together and then
drove to the levee just north of Fort Worth's central business
district.
</P>
<P>
   They walked across the dry grass together until they found the
spot they shared on that first date. Jeff was shaking. Holly was
smiling. He dropped quickly to one knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will you marry me?''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you think?'' Her bell-like laugh drifted out across
the river. They would be each other's to have and to hold, for
better or for worse, in sickness and in health, for the rest of
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   She was 18 _ and afraid to tell her folks.
</P>
<P>
   They decided a yearlong engagement would give everyone time to
get used to the idea. ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The scrapbook contains a snapshot of their wedding day _ June 8,
1996. In the photo, Jeff and Holly hurry down the church steps to a
white limo waiting at the curb. A stiff breeze snags Holly's
borrowed veil and scatters the red and white balloons that well
wishers released instead of throwing rice.
</P>
<P>
   A receipt for one night at the Omni Mandalay hotel in Las
Colinas, Room 2402, is glued next to the photo.
</P>
<P>
   Their marriage license is on the next page. Over it are pasted
ticket stubs from SeaWorld, Natural Bridge Caverns and the Hard
Rock Cafe in San Antonio. There's also a paper liner from a
Pringles Potato Chip can, a reminder of their incredible luck.
</P>
<P>
   On the return trip from San Antonio, they stopped to buy gas, a
can of Pringles _ and a lottery ticket. The ticket was a winner
that brought them $100.
</P>
<P>
   Life was remarkably good for the Smiths. They had a little
apartment on the third level of a large Haltom City complex. They
had a little dog, a pug-Chihuahua mix called Gerty. Holly and Jeff
both had jobs at a North Richland Hills insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   Then one morning in March 1997, Jeff woke coughing up blood.
They rushed to the hospital. In June, they celebrated their first
wedding anniversary, and in July, Jeff's left lung collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   The climb to the third-floor apartment was too much. They moved
to the second level, but that was just the beginning of their
downward adjustment. Over the next year, Jeff was in and out of the
hospital often. They tried to make the best of what they had.
</P>
<P>
   They cuddled on the blue denim couch _ and sometimes fought. ``I
didn't want to talk to her because I was afraid it would upset her.
She didn't want to talk to me because she was afraid it would upset
me,'' Jeff says with a shrug of his thin shoulders. ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The cards in the scrapbook tell the story. ``I will love you
forever, Holl''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry. I know I hurt you. I love you, Baby.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you're not happy. The ball is in your court. Whatever
is broken we need to fix. I'm sorry. ... ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like the way we argued today. ... I feel like every
second we have is starting to count. I think sometimes I am in
God's time clock and He's waiting to punch me out to go home. ... I
love you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry. Hang in there. We'll get through this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's been hard the last few days. I want you to know
that I am here for you always.''
</P>
<P>
   On their second anniversary, Jeff gave her a card. Inside he
wrote, ``Two people. Two hugs. Two kisses, Two years turn into a
lifetime.'' He gave her a silver charm: XX over OO, shorthand for
two hugs and two kisses. She put the charm on her bracelet and
fastened the card into the scrapbook, next to the one she gave him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The past two years have been the best for me. I know we have
some ups and downs, but through it all we stick together. I think
that is what makes us us. I love you. Your partner, Holl,'' she
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff sits on the hospital bed now and looks at the words. ``We
grew up,'' he says. ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Even as they settled into a more confident understanding, their
life together was about to become even more difficult. Last year,
after months in the hospital followed by a regimen of home
medication, IVs and bed rest, Jeff had used up all his sick leave
at the insurance company where he and Holly both worked. The Smiths
were forced to live only on Holly's salary. It was harder than
either could have imagined.
</P>
<P>
   They sold the Ford, but finances were not Jeff's only concern.
</P>
<P>
   He worried about Holly working all day, rushing to the hospital
to see him and then going home to a dark apartment to walk Gerty
alone. Holly was swimming with fatigue by the time she reached her
door.
</P>
<P>
   Loneliness became her companion. She would leave a light on in
the kitchen and most often fall asleep with the television running.
Hungry for companionship, she began to drop by her parents' house.
If she joined co-workers for dinner or a drink, she felt guilty and
hurried home.
</P>
<P>
   Then Jeff lost his job.
</P>
<P>
   They both knew it was coming, knew it was the best thing _ at
least then he could collect disability. He'd used up all of his
sick days and it had been two months since he had had a paycheck.
Now they have only Holly's income and Jeff's small Social Security
check.
</P>
<P>
   In January of this year, they gave up their apartment and moved
into her parents' North Richland Hills home. They share the
upstairs bedroom Holly had when she was a student at Keller High
School. It is better, they know, but oh so difficult to give up
that independence.
</P>
<P>
   At least now when Jeff is hospitalized, Holly comes home to
other people. That's a relief for him _ and for her.
</P>
<P>
   Even with that added support, hospital stays are tough, she
says. It means she eats lunch at her desk so she can leave early
and see Jeff. If he's up to a stroll, she pulls the oxygen bottle
and they walk the hospital corridors together. They talk about her
work, about their dogs: Audrey, a dachshund puppy, and Gerty, their
old friend who knows when to kiss away the inevitable tears.
</P>
<P>
   Holly gets into the hospital bed with Jeff, and they watch
television. Sometimes they play Uno. He makes her leave before
dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look up and I'll be there,'' he whispers as she goes. ___ &QC; 
(MORE)
</P>
<P>
   The scrapbook records dozens of hospital stays. There are cards
from Holly and cards from the dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come home soon. Mommy doesn't cuddle as well as you do,
Gerty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We miss you. Gerty and Audrey.''
</P>
<P>
   The good times are there, too: Christmas snapshots and birthday
celebrations and photos of other friends, some of whom have CF.
Some now gone.
</P>
<P>
   Holly and Jeff pose in front of the Italian Inn, ``home of the
singing waiters.'' They smile on a white-sand beach while an azure
sea laps around their bare feet. There are stubs from shows and
concerts.
</P>
<P>
   In September of last year, Jeff won a writing contest sponsored
by a pharmaceutical company and a trip to the Big Apple. His
winning entry was called ``Rules of Life.'' It is a list of ways to
cope with cystic fibrosis.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff's health was failing badly, but their families encouraged
them to go to New York, Jeff's dream city. Enjoy every minute,
they'd said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff gave Holly a card that she glued into the scrapbook.
``Baby, If I've learned one thing this past year, it's to make the
most of each and every day. ... We are going to have the time of
our lives in New York. ... All I am begins with you.''
</P>
<P>
   The trip was exhilarating, exciting _ and very difficult. Jeff
was sick every day, struggling for breath, pushing himself to see a
Broadway show, working to take the carriage ride through Central
Park, determined to have one never-to-be-forgotten dinner at the
Rainbow Room.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was romantic and magical,'' he says of that dinner. He
looks at Holly beside him on the hospital bed. ``You wore that new
gray dress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You wore that gray suit with a blue shirt,'' she says and
smiles a sunshine smile.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff grew weaker, thinner, sicker by the day. They came home on
a Monday. By Friday he was in the hospital again.
</P>
<P>
   His doctor said it was time to talk about a lung transplant.
</P>
<P>
   The Smiths had always told their doctor that if Jeff's condition
ever warranted it, they wanted to talk about the possibility of a
transplant. But when Jeff actually heard the news, he was numb.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed suspended between life and eternity, twisting from
sunlight to shadow as he dialed Holly's work number. She was
excited and optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Holly saw this announcement as Jeff's second chance at life _
and she was determined to keep his spirits high.
</P>
<P>
   After he'd been on the transplant list for three months, Holly
threw a party. It was time to celebrate, she said. She planned a
picnic at Chisholm Park in Hurst. She wore a purple ribbon to
symbolize their fight against cystic fibrosis and a blue ribbon as
a reminder of the importance of organ donation. It was May 23,
1999.
</P>
<P>
   The first week of June, the Smiths celebrated their third
wedding anniversary and the next week, Jeff was hospitalized. He is
home now, but there is no rhythm to their days. The chronic nature
of this illness prevents it. Jeff bounces from the bedroom he
shares with Holly to the hospital and back again in an
unpredictable cycle.
</P>
<P>
   The future is only a beautiful dream, and neither Holly nor Jeff
will say where they may be even a year from now.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping for the best, Holly has left several blank sheets in the
scrapbook, waiting to be filled with mementos from the days to come
_ but these are not the last pages in the book.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to the back, Holly has fastened other keepsakes of their
life together: obituaries that report the loss of friends _ Anna
Marie Infante, 15; Amy Pack, 21; Chrystina Mari Melanson, 18;
William E. Bill Ross, 38; Frank Houston Manan _ reminders that all
lives are not long, that friendship and family and hope matter _
and that love counts as much as life itself.

TICKS ON NANTUCKET  
 VICTORY SHIPS  
 TICKETS FOR THE DERBY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 25) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Twenty years ago I took my dog to Nantucket. Every
time he went out, he came back with ticks _ not two or three but
dozens. Now I have a new dog. Should I leave him at home, or go to
Maine? _ Paul H. Stacey, Bloomfield, Conn.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. There is no question that Nantucket has plenty of deer ticks,
federal, state and local officials agree. Although that does not
rule out taking your dog, it does mean taking precautions. Dr.
Paula Klek, a veterinarian on Nantucket, said she didn't think she
was seeing any more or less Lyme disease. She noted, though, that
it was ``kind of hard to track because there is no way to
absolutely prove that a dog has Lyme disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, figures from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention on the incidence of the disease in Massachusetts show no
clear pattern over the last decade. But the Northeast is clearly a
center of the disease: in 1998 seven out of eight states that had
more than 10 reported cases per 100,000 people were in that region,
the CDC reported.
</P>
<P>
   A major factor in exposure is terrain, said Dr. Kathleen F.
Gensheimer, state epidemiologist in Maine's Department of Human
Services. ``If you're just planning to go to the seashore in Maine
or Nantucket, chances are you're not even going to come in contact
with a tick. If you enjoy hiking in a woody, grassy area, your
chances of becoming infected are somewhat increased.''
</P>
<P>
   On Nantucket last year three tick-borne diseases were reported:
117 cases of Lyme disease, 56 of babesiosis and 4 of ehrlichiosis,
said Richard Ray, the town's health inspector.
</P>
<P>
   In all of Maine in 1998, Dr. Gensheimer said, about 65 cases of
Lyme disease were reported, and no babesiosis or ehrlichiosis was
reported.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent dogs from contracting Lyme disease, Dr. Kathleen
Orloski, an epidemiologist and veterinarian at the CDC, recommends
a repellent containing either permethrin or fipronil in the form of
a spray or as a spot-on, which is applied to a dog's shoulder
blades.
</P>
<P>
   Dogs can be vaccinated against Lyme disease, but a supplemental
repellent is advised so they don't get other tick-borne diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Nantucket is well aware of the tick problem. Ray, the health
inspector, said that its public-information program included
fliers, reminders at motels and warnings on walking trails. He
advised visitors to check daily for ticks and to be alert to the
possibility of tick-borne diseases once they return home.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Lyme disease is mistakenly dismissed as the flu
because the symptoms are similar, or as a heat rash. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)In 1946, I sailed on a Victory ship from Seattle to
Yokohama as a member of a USO tour. I am trying to recall the name
of the ship, which carried thousands of new GI's and our company as
well as other USO entertainers. Where can I get a list of Victory
ships? _ Joseph Leon, Saugerties, N.Y.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. You can try two approaches: checking a reference work or
getting your military personnel records.
</P>
<P>
   Victory ships, the first of which was launched in 1944, near the
end of the World War II, were essentially improved Liberty ships.
They were operated by the merchant marine and carried troops and
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Two books are recommended by Donald Gill, librarian at the
United States Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point, N.Y.:
``Troopships of World War II'' by Roland W. Charles (Army
Transportation Association, 1947) and ``Victory Ships and Tankers''
by L.A. Sawyer and W.H. Mitchell (Cornell Maritime Press, 1974).
Both list all 534 Victory ships and provide terse descriptions,
with the Charles book being more generous with detail.
</P>
<P>
   For just the names _ from the Aberdeen Victory to the Zanesville
Victory _ visit www.armed-guard.com or www.usmm.org. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Veterans who want their records should file a Form 180. It is
available from the National Archives and Records Administration,
8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, Md. 20740; (301) 713-6800. nternet
users can download it from www.nara.gov/regional/mpr.html.
</P>
<P>
   Merchant seamen should write to United States Coast Guard
National Maritime Center, 4200 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 510,
Arlington, Va. 22203-1804 or call (202) 493-1029. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)I am interested in a package deal to the Kentucky
Derby in Louisville next year. Is there a package that includes
transportation to the track and seats? _ Mitzi Weissman, Hooksett,
N.H.(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Tour operators offer packages geared to every pocketbook.
They usually include both the Derby, which will be on May 6, and
the Kentucky Oaks (for 3-year-old fillies) the day before. A more
costly package means a better seat and usually more amenities _
such as a more elaborate meal or a more elegant setting for a meal.
</P>
<P>
   Should you decide that where you might be sitting in the
third-floor clubhouse isn't quite good enough, you can _ if you
don't mind parting with a thou or two _ get a better seat. The most
expensive upgrades are for Sections 316 to 318 in the third-floor
clubhouse, at or near the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   Though Churchill Downs is in Louisville, note that some packages
have lodging in Lexington, about 80 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a sampling of options, with prices per person based on
double occupancy for a three-night stay. Transportation between
hotel and Churchill Downs is included, air fare is not. Unless
otherwise specified, rates given are for the year 2000.

MANY INTERNET ENTREPRENEURS ARE NOT GETTING REALLY, REALLY RICH

(pr) 
 By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Barnesandnoble.com was preparing to go public in April,
employees talked giddily about their future wealth. Having accepted
stock options as a big chunk of their compensation _ a common
practice among Internet ventures _ many of them dreamed that their
shares would mimic those of companies like Theglobe.com, whose
stock shot up 500 percent on the first day of trading.
</P>
<P>
   People were walking around with calculators trying to estimate
what they would be worth and discussing plans to repay student
loans or buy new apartments, one Barnesandnoble.com insider said.
But after an early jump, the venture's stock actually dove beneath
its initial offering price. Within a month of going public, a half
dozen or so disillusioned staff members had resigned. The stock has
since bounced slightly above its initial price.
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of 1999, many an enterprising soul has
founded an Internet company, offered stock and created a fortune,
sometimes achieving a billion-dollar stock market valuation
seemingly overnight. Everyone from newly minted college graduates
to established professionals like Lou Dobbs, the CNN financial
commentator, who quit to run an outfit called Space.com, seems to
be hurrying to get a piece of the action.
</P>
<P>
   But like any gold rush this one has a lot of seekers who never
hit the mother lode. While statistics are not available for
individuals or even for companies that do not get off the ground,
the venture capitalists that finance start-up companies have a rule
of thumb. For every 10 ventures that receive financing (and plenty
do not), two will be stock market successes, which means
spectacular gains for early investors; three will become part of
other concerns, which can translate into a nice return, and the
rest will fail. That means a lot of Internet entrepreneurs and
their employees who end up disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Even those Internet ventures that have glittering stock
offerings may not be able to sustain those stock prices long enough
for people with stock options to cash out. Of the 91 initial public
offerings of Internet stocks priced this year through July 9, only
30 are trading above the level they hit after their first day of
trading, according to Thomson Financial Securities Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Not getting really, really rich should not be news, but during
these heady times it is a violation of expectations. Clay Shirky, a
professor of new media at Hunter College in New York City who
admits to occasional bouts of jealousy about the new riches
himself, argues that people both inside and outside the industry
have developed a distorted view of how easy it is to get wealthy.
</P>

   Shirky, who, by his own admission, spends numerous hours talking
to industry colleagues about the newest millionaires, said, ``The
perception that about one person in six gets lucky is a fiction.''
It can't be more than one in a thousand, he figures.
</P>
<P>
   For those left behind, even if they have achieved modest
success, it can mean bitterness. What makes it even harder to take
is the apparent randomness of success. After all, nearly all
Internet companies are losing money. So why are a few doing so well
while others languish?
</P>
<P>
   Paul Cohen started a web site called Biztravel.com, for business
people who are always on the road. Thinking he needed big backers
and professional management to make the site into a booming
business, in 1996 Cohen sold a majority stake for ``less than a
million'' to a consortium that included News Corp, Intel, Informix
and Sir Bernard Ashley of Laura Ashley.
</P>
<P>
   The group then invested $20 million, but in Cohen's view, was
not focused on exactly which market it was aiming at. The company
has been through two chief executives since the acquisition and now
the position is vacant. A Biztravel spokeswoman, Mimi Bloom,
confirmed that ``our investors are very open to the possibility of
a sale,'' which is just what agitates Cohen. ``The majority of the
investors are going to lose their stake,'' predicts Cohen, who does
not think the purchase price will equal their investments. ``It
could have been an IPO, a big one,'' he observes.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the new windfall has been toughest on the industry's
pioneers, who simply arrived too soon. Howard Rheingold founded
some of the Internet's best-known and most highly regarded ventures
over the past two decades, including Electric Minds, which Time
magazine named one of the top 10 web sites in 1996. But all his
businesses have since failed, and Rheingold, though comfortable, is
hardly swimming in Internet money. It sometimes gets to him. ``I've
had to meditate on this a lot,'' he admits. ``My goal in life is
not to be a jillionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is disconsolate, of course, but handling real-world
bumps after harboring Trump-sized ambitions can be humbling. Juno
Online Services Inc., a web access and e-mail service, went public
at the end of May at $13, and its stock almost immediately tanked.
The price went as low as $8.875 before rumors of a merger sent it
to the mid-$20s, where it has stayed. ``It is human nature to feel
better when fortunes are doing better than poorly,'' concedes its
president, Charles Ardai, who did not return phone calls until his
stock had climbed past the offering price. ``But we make sure to
remind people it is a volatile industry.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the hardest lessons for would-be Midases to absorb has
been the incredible arbitrariness of the stock market. These days,
starry-eyed start-up owners are also discovering that the same
forces that created blow-out Internet offerings, namely the good
will of the market and day traders, can be very fickle. If the
market suddenly goes cold and a company has already set a date for
going public, there is little it can do but pray.
</P>
<P>
   ``Timing is everything,'' said David Cowan, a partner as
Bessemer Venture Partners, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm,
who recently watched as Flycast, an online advertising firm that he
helped finance, got off to a disappointing start. ``It is
absolutely the case that an IPO's success has a lot more to do with
the IPO market than with the fundamentals of the business.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the market goes sour, even the most glittering success
can lose much of its shine. Two months ago, Dave Kansas, editor of
Thestreet.com, was the talk of the Internet world. When
Thestreet.com, in which the New York Times Co. has invested, went
public in May, its stock price quickly surged from $18 to $60.
Kansas found himself the subject of numerous articles, penned in
amazement that a mere journalist could suddenly be worth $9.1
million. As a company officer, however, Kansas is prohibited from
cashing out until November. In the meantime, he has watched the
value of his stock drop by more than half. ``I joke with friends,
`Hey, I lost a million bucks last week, what did you do?'''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas can joke, of course, because he is still, in theory,
worth millions, but to employees lower down the totem poll a crash
in the stock price can be devastating to dreams. Managers who count
on stock as a motivator have had to learn to punt. Todd Krizelman,
the 25-year-old co-chief executive and co-founder of Theglobe.com,
watched his company's stock rocket from its offering price of 9 to
almost 49 and then settle back to the high teens. On paper he is
worth many millions, but his employees are working on much smaller
margins. ``It was great euphoria when we were going public, the
fact that it had turned us around so quickly has been a
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Krizelman says he does not want employees to be like day
traders, checking the stock price 40 to 50 times a day.
``Ninety-five percent of our employees have stock options,'' said
Krizelman, who sold 5 percent of his holdings in the second
quarter. ``We tell them it is the right bet in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   Marie Toulantis, the chief financial officer for
Barnesandnoble.com, also argues that most of her employees are too
smart to focus on today's stock price. ``I don't think it was
anyone's major reason for leaving,'' she said of the staff
departures. ``Options can take four years to vest; it is not like
cash today.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Internet truism that entrepreneurs are coming to terms
with is that even good ideas with lots of backing do not always
flower into fortunes. Web Flow was one of the first software
companies to offer ``multi-platform'' applications _ programs
compatible with numerous computer types and operating systems _
making it an incredibly promising company in 1995. Bob Arasmith,
its vice president for engineering, remembers that venture
capitalists were vying to back them. ``It was no effort to get
millions,'' he said. The company raised $4 million in December 1995
and $10 million more six months later.
</P>
<P>
   But the marketplace did not take to the concept as quickly as
the venture firms. By the spring of 1998, the company was out of
business, and the board sold it back to its software developers for
pennies on the dollar. Today, Arasmith is president of a company
that makes a similar product and seems circumspect about the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to be profitable, but I don't imagine that we will
sell out for $100 million,'' he said, ``and we don't walk around
looking at Ferrari dealerships like we used to.''

MICROSOFT TO SELL INTERNET CITY GUIDES TO RIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Microsoft Corp. agreed on Monday to sell its Sidewalk series
of Internet city guides to a rival, Ticketmaster Online-Citysearch,
in a stock deal worth $240 million.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft confirmed that the deal, news of which had emerged
during the weekend, would give it a 9 percent stake in Ticketmaster
Online-Citysearch, which is controlled by USA Networks, with the
option to increase that stake to 13 percent. Ticketmaster will
eventually fold the Sidewalk sites into its network of Citysearch
sites.
</P>
<P>
   As it retreats from the city-guide business, Microsoft will
retain two components of Sidewalk _ its buying guides and
searchable business directories _ and fold them into a new local
service on its MSN network. Ticketmaster Online will provide much
of the content for that as-yet-unnamed MSN service, including
ticketing, personal dating services and arts and entertainment
reviews, company officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft will also feature Ticketmaster's ticket-selling
operation throughout the MSN network and on its WebTV service.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one fell swoop, Citysearch got rid of a rival and gained a
distribution partner,'' said Lisa Allen, an analyst with Forrester
Research, an Internet consulting firm. ``It gives Citysearch an
immediate presence in some big markets, and it gives Microsoft a
graceful exit from its city-guide strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ticketmaster Online's chief executive, Charles Conn, said that
the cross-marketing agreement included no restrictions, allowing
Citysearch to continue providing content to MSN's rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Sidewalk and the Citysearch service, which both offer on-line
information about local entertainment, news and shopping in dozens
of cities, have been rivals since Sidewalk opened its first site in
early 1997, several months after Citysearch started its service.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft initially hired experienced journalists to turn
Sidewalk into a kind of on-line magazine and event guide. But the
company shifted Sidewalk from an emphasis on arts and
entertainment, as an anticipated boom in advertising from
restaurants and theaters failed to materialize. Instead, it veered
more toward electronic commerce and product information.
</P>
<P>
   Citysearch, though, has cashed in on arts and entertainment
content by selling tickets and offering a dating section and local
auctions.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which is expected to close in the fall, will allow
Citysearch to more than double the number of city sites it runs,
from 33 to 77 worldwide. Citysearch, now the third most popular
city guide network as measured by the Internet research firm Media
Metrix, would become the largest, attracting an estimated 7 million
monthly visitors. Citysearch would reach nearly 11 percent of
Internet users in the United States each month.
</P>
<P>
   America Online Inc.'s Digital Cities would remain in second
place among city guides, with a 6.3 percent reach. New York Today,
owned by The New York Times Co., competes with Sidewalk and
Citysearch in the New York market.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The sale of Sidewalk is noteworthy partly because Microsoft
rarely sells businesses and because it represents another step in
the evolution of its Internet strategy away from entertainment and
information.
</P>
<P>
   In its initial incarnation, MSN was a content-heavy entity, with
a schedule of ``shows,'' the on-line magazine Slate and the
Sidewalk sites. After spending heavily on such ventures, Microsoft
has altered the mix, promoting services like Carpoint, a car buying
service, its financial site MSN Investor and the travel site
Expedia. In March, when it bought the Comparenet shopping service,
Microsoft said it planned to move more aggressively into
e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   By selling Sidewalk, the company sheds an unprofitable division,
while keeping components that bolster its inventory of e-commerce
offerings.

NEW RULES TO GIVE IRS MORE FLEXIBILITY IN HARDSHIP CASES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (jw) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a new break for owners of assets, the Internal Revenue
Service will issue regulations Wednesday allowing people with
overdue taxes to keep their stocks, businesses and homes if they
can show that they need them to pay for medical care or basic
living expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``For taxpayers caught in severe hardships,'' said Charles
Rossotti, the tax commissioner, ``this gives the IRS a new tool to
work with people and help settle their tax debt.'' He called the
regulations ``a safety valve to handle tax cases in difficult
situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1930, regulations have permitted the IRS to discount
overdue taxes, but only when there was doubt about whether the
government could collect or the taxpayer actually owed the tax.
When these conditions did not exist, the IRS mandate was to seize
assets and sell them, often at a sharp discount, to pay the taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules, a taxpayer with a large stock portfolio and
a history of paying taxes on time until trouble struck might be
able to wipe out or significantly reduce a tax bill if he or she
could show that the assets were needed, for example, to pay medical
bills, said Steve Pyrek, an IRS spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Owners of large retirement funds might be allowed to keep all or
part of them if they could demonstrate that loss of the funds would
leave them destitute. The regulations would also allow flexibility
in dealing with taxpayers who had not complied with rules set by
Congress: for example, a taxpayer who did not file for a refund
before the deadline because she was in a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations implement orders issued by Congress in the IRS
Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 to provide greater relief from
tax debts. The provisions were adopted after testimony in Senate
Finance Committee hearings that accused the IRS of mistreating
taxpayers, although much of that testimony has since been
discredited.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department, in the regulatory notice, included a
history lesson that appeared intended to make sure that Congress
would be held responsible if the relaxation of the rules created
more problems than it solved.
</P>
<P>
   The notice quoted from a letter written in 1933 by Dean Acheson,
then the acting treasury secretary, seeking authority to discount
or write off tax bills if collection would ``destroy a business,
ruin a tax producer, throw men out of employment, or result in the
impoverishment of widows or minor children of a deceased
taxpayer.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general at the time, Homer Cummings, replied in a
written opinion that while strong arguments existed for ``a liberal
rule'' on discounts in hardship cases, ``if such a course is to be
taken, it should be at the instance of Congress'' and not a
presidential administration.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS called the new regulations ``a significant change,'' but
tax professionals who specialize in collection matters called it
window dressing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it involves much money,'' said Donald Alexander,
a Washington lawyer who was tax commissioner in Richard Nixon's
administration. ``This is more cosmetic than real.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the IRS made 25,052 compromise agreements in which it
wrote off $1.6 billion of $1.9 billion in overdue taxes, collecting
$290 million, or 15 percent, of the tax bills. Taxpayers owed $246
billion in back taxes last year, up 5 percent from 1997, but the
IRS regards more than half of that as uncollectible.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Kassel, who represents taxpayers with overdue taxes, said
that the IRS had already found ways to handle difficult cases, like
that of one of his clients, a man in his late '70s who owned his
home free and clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IRS agreed to a very small monthly payment, and then they
put a lien on his house,'' he said, delaying collection until the
man dies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every once in a while you hear about a cruel, heartless
collection agent,'' said Kassel, of Daly City, Calif. ``But that is
the rare exception.''

VIAGRA HELPS PLANTS KEEP STALKS STIFF

   Picture a research collaboration between  &UR; Bob Dole &LR;  and  &UR; Martha &LR; 
 &UR; Stewart &LR; . Researchers at Bar-Ilan University in Israel have
determined that Viagra will help double the life span of plants,
fruit and vegetables. ``Plants aren't all that different from
people,'' said plant physiologist Yaacov Leshem. Viagra ``helps
prevent aging and helps them stay erect.''
</P>
<P>
   A few drops of Viagra dissolved in water helps to cut the
emission of ethylene from cut flowers. It's ethylene that causes
ripening and eventual spoilage. Leshem says the only drawback is
the cost of Viagra, and, oh, the possible effects on consumers who
eat vegetables treated with the stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could certainly affect impotency ...'' said Leshem, and
``also have a negative influence on elderly people if they have
health complications. Our recommendation for the time being is that
Viagra only be safely applied to cut flowers. People don't tend to
eat roses.''

CLINTONS OFFER CONDOLENCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and
sister-in-law presumed dead in a plane crash, President Clinton
Monday began openly grieving, saying the tragedy had been a ``very
difficult thing'' for his family because of their closeness to the
Kennedys.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hillary Rodham Clinton postponed a political trip to
New York because of the tragedy. She was scheduled to begin a
three-day swing Tuesday through Elmira, Bath and Ithaca that was
part of her summerlong ``listening tour'' as she weighs a run for a
US Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's Senate
exploratory committee, said the trip would be rescheduled as soon
as possible, but the first lady was mourning and did not feel up to
it now.
</P>
<P>
   Both Clintons have made calls to Kennedy's only surviving
immediate family member, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, and also to
his uncle, Senator Edward M. Kennedy. The president has spoken with
Schlossberg twice _ including at about noon Monday _ and a half
dozen times with Senator Kennedy in the last three days.
</P>
<P>
   After speaking with Schlossberg Monday, Clinton was briefed by
Coast Guard Commandant James Loy and Coast Guard Rear Admiral
Richard M. Larrabee about the search for the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   The president urged Larrabee to ``continue doing what he could
to help find what they find, or some way to bring this to
closure,'' said White House spokesman Jake Siewert.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, speaking at a joint news conference with Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak, said Larrabee was ``somewhat optimistic''
about the possibility of finding further wreckage from the plane
that contained Kennedy, his wife Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and her
older sister, Lauren Bessette.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it's appropriate that this search continue,''
Clinton told reporters, adding that he thought the Coast Guard and
other local, state and federal agencies had done ``a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said Clinton learned only a short time
before the rest of the nation Sunday night that federal authorities
had given up searching for survivors and presumed all three
passengers on the plane were dead. As soon as the victims' families
and the president were briefed, the information was quickly relayed
to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, speaking off the cuff in what were some of his most
heartfelt remarks since America awoke Saturday to the horror of
Kennedy's disappearance, said: ``Let me say that John Kennedy and
his sister and later his wife were uncommonly kind to my daughter
and to my wife. And this has been a very difficult thing for us
personally, as well as because of my position.''
</P>
<P>
   He added about the Kennedy family, ``They are very strong
people, and I think they're carrying on as well as any human beings
could, but they need the support and prayers of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak, standing beside Clinton, said on behalf of himself and
the Israeli people, ``Our prayers and thoughts to the Kennedy
family that faced so many tragedies and now is facing another one,
a tragedy that I believe touched hearts of billions all around the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Barak both offered thoughtful prayers for the
Kennedy and Bessette families in their toasts Sunday during a White
House dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday while honoring the US Women's soccer team for
winning the World Cup, Clinton linked the celebration of the
women's win with the sadness of the Kennedy and Bessette deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is at times like this that we really stop to recognize that
as big and diverse as our country is, we can come together as a
national family. We can come together in our sorrow or in joy, if
it reflects the values that we honor most,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, who also was present, said, ``If the
Kennedy family has stood for any one ideal above all others, it is
that each of us, by the work of our own hands and hearts, can make
a contributon and a difference.''

REP. FRANK SAYS DNC TO BLAME IN WGBH DONOR LIST DILEMMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Representative Barney Frank is blaming the
Democratic National Committee for its role in swapping donor lists
with public television stations, saying the DNC ``should have known
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank, a Democrat from Massachusetts, saying the DNC should be
reprimanded for its list-swapping, plans to write a letter to
Democratic Party officials urging them to ``apologize, say it was a
terrible mistake, and to institute a procedure to say it will never
happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It should have been against their policy,'' Frank said in a
telephone interview over the weekend. ``This is a terrible error in
judgment, and I regret very much that the DNC did this, because I
think they jeopardized public broadcasting. It's not just a case
of, if it's legal, do it. I hold the DNC more responsible than I do
'GBH.''
</P>
<P>
   DNC officials did not return a phone call Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, several House Republicans criticized Boston's WGBH-TV
and three other public stations for the practice, saying their
pattern of list-swapping with the DNC could be in violation of
federal law. Two stations later said they traded with both liberal
and conservative groups, but only after the list-swapping with the
DNC had come under attack.
</P>
<P>
   The implication was that the DNC, a private fund-raising
committee, was not at fault because it is allowed under law to
trade lists with whomever it wants. DNC officials said they
employed an outside broker to manage their donor lists, and
therefore did not monitor the swaps. They also said the practice
was fully legal.
</P>
<P>
   Until Frank's comments, officials at the Republican National
Committee were leading the charge against the DNC's involvement in
swapping lists with public stations. RNC officials insist they have
never traded lists with a public television station, although they
have not ruled out the possibility of exchanging names with a
charity. Michael Collins, a spokesman for the RNC, said last week
that the list-swapping was proof the Democratic Party ``regards
public broadcasting as a branch office.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank said the problem lies in perception more than reality, but
the practice of list-swapping itself was also unacceptable. In his
letter, Frank said, he will write: ``I hope you will adopt a policy
_ and I'm sorry you already haven't _ that you will not make
inappropriate solicitations. It's terrible judgment, and very
insensitive to what was appropriate.''

SPORTS COLUMN: A GOLFER'S DECISIONS, DECISIONS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Ill., Pa., Colo., Britain)   (jw) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In golf, it's known as managing your game. It's making the
correct decision on which club to hit and where to hit your ball as
much as it is making the correct swing. Decisions, decisions.
</P>
<P>
   It's what Payne Stewart did in winning the U.S. Open at
Pinehurst No. 2, and what Jose Maria Olazabal did in winning the
Masters at Augusta National. It's what the winner of the year's
final major, the PGA Championship, will need to do over 7,401 yards
of decisions at Medinah No. 3 outside Chicago on Aug. 12-15.
</P>
<P>
   It's also what Jean Van de Velde did not do during his
triple-bogey 7 on the 72nd hole of the British Open that enabled
Paul Lawrie, a virtually unknown Scot who had finished two hours
earlier with a four-under-par 67, to come out of the Carnoustie
clubhouse and win a four-hole playoff.
</P>
<P>
   The Frenchman didn't choke; he just didn't think. With a
three-stroke lead in the final round's final twosome, Jean Van de
Velde should have played the 487-yard par-4 cautiously: an iron off
the tee, another iron short of the Barry Burn, a wedge onto the
green, two putts or even three putts. He could have won with a
double-bogey six.
</P>
<P>
   He decided to win heroically, with a driver off the tee.
</P>
<P>
   That was the Frenchman's first bad decision: his tee shot veered
to the right into light rough. His second bad decision was going
for the green with a 2-iron; his ball ricocheted off the grandstand
and the top of the Barry Burn wall into high rough.
</P>
<P>
   His third bad decision was trying to go for the green again
instead of pitching to the fairway; his ball splashed into the
Barry Burn. After a penalty stroke and a drop into shorter rough,
his wedge shot plopped into a bunker in front of the green.
</P>
<P>
   His clutch sand shot to within 6 feet and a clutch putt salvaged
a 72-hole total of 290 and a tie with Lawrie and Justin Leonard,
but when the Scot won the playoff with a birdie-birdie finish, Van
de Velde will be remembered for the most momentous final-hole
collapse in golf history.
</P>
<P>
   Only one similar disaster comes to mind _ Sam Snead's 8 on the
479-yard finishing hole in the 1939 U.S. Open at the Spring Mill
course of the Philadelphia Country Club, although Snead wasn't in
the final group.
</P>
<P>
   Byron Nelson was already in with 284, but in that era of no
leader boards, Snead didn't realize he needed only a par 5 for 283.
After a hooked drive into the rough, he went for the green with a
3-wood and topped his ball into a deep bunker. Going for the green
with an 8-iron, his ball jammed into the bunker's face, then he
chopped his ball into another bunker near the green. On in five, he
three-putted from 40 feet for a 74 and 286.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Wood and Denny Shute, playing behind Snead, each tied
Nelson at 284, but Nelson won the playoff.
</P>
<P>
   Snead would never win a U.S. Open, the only gap on his PGA Tour
record of 81 tournament victories.
</P>
<P>
   In golf's majors so far this year, the setup of each course has
been an issue: the new rough at Augusta National, the turtle-back
greens at Pinehurst No. 2, and what the pros considered unfair
narrow fairways in the landing areas for tee shots at Carnoustie,
as directed by Royal &AMP; Ancient officials.
</P>
<P>
   At the PGA, the issue will be length: Medinah's 7,401 yards will
be the most in a major at sea level. At the 1967 PGA Championship,
the mile-high Columbine (Colo.) Country Club measured 7,436 yards
when Don January beat Don Massengale in an 18-hole playoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medinah's setup will be similar to Winged Foot in 1997 when
Davis Love III won,'' said Kerry Haigh, the PGA of America's senior
tournament director.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rough will be 4{ to 5 inches, the fairways will be
anywhere from 23 to 32 yards wide. They'll be able to hit their
drivers at six or seven holes.''
</P>
<P>
   Another issue will be Medinah's 4,161 trees, mostly oak and
hickory, that are now taller than when Hale Irwin won the 1990 U.S.
Open over 7,195 yards in a 19-hole playoff with Mike Donald.
</P>
<P>
   To stay out of Medinah's trees, the golfers at the PGA will need
to make the correct decision as well as the correct swing. And if
one comes to the 445-yard par-4 final hole on Sunday with a
three-stroke lead, he'll surely do what Jean Van de Velde did not
do: hit an iron off the tee.

GIVING WOMEN A SPORTING CHANCE

<TEXT>
<P>
   I think I played kickball once.
</P>
<P>
   As I understand it, that isn't exactly the same as soccer, but
it's the closest I'll ever get to the game that put America on top
last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   And you might say it's as close as I'll ever get to being an
athlete. I think I was OK with this until the U.S. women's soccer
team defeated China to win the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girls rule! Boys drool! Soccer's cool,'' the chant went.
</P>
<P>
   I haven't cared much for sports since I stopped drooling for
Jimmy Carstafnur and stopped cheering for the McComb High School
Tigers back in 1975. But last Sunday, while watching the replays
and the jubilation surrounding the women's soccer team's victory, I
had this sudden urge to play a sport, to be part of a winning team.
</P>
<P>
   I think I played softball once. What I remember most is that no
one wanted me on their team.
</P>
<P>
   Briana Scurry. Brandi Chastain. Sunday, I was one of them,
albeit much older and with a lot less athletic talent. They and
their teammates are America's new female role models and heroes.
There are even two 31-year-old mothers on the team, real soccer
moms. We've come a long way. Or have we?
</P>
<P>
   You think so until something like this happens and you're
reminded of how slowly the clock ticks for us. Women's sports still
gets less press coverage and female professional athletes (and if I
might add women in general) still make less money than their male
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   A news story said that these pioneers, for instance, would make
less ($12,500 bonus) for winning the World Cup than Los Angeles
Dodgers pitcher Kevin Brown gets for retiring one batter.
</P>
<P>
   And at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, women's soccer wasn't deemed
ready for prime time television. There, the United States defeated
China 2-1 before 76,000, but NBC aired only 10 minutes of
previously taped highlights.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't the sort of thing you want to read about if you're a
mother of two little girls. Not in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, you soothe yourself with the gains that have been made.
The women in the photographs, smiling at you from the television
screen, that's you and what you might become.
</P>
<P>
   That's your hope for your little girls. If you have lived long
enough, though, you know from experience that there are some doors
that are still shut because of gender. Because it happened to you,
someone will look at them and whether they say it or not, decide a
man needs the job more because he's got a family to support.
</P>
<P>
   A guy told me once to ``stop bitching.'' I told him I'd
appreciate it if he wouldn't use such words when talking to me.
Funny, we still live in a world where men can offer constructive
criticism; a woman does it and she is called a complainer or even
worse, with a note going into her personnel file.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, I got off a plane from Seattle and saw Scurry and
Chastain and their teammates on the front page of this newspaper
and for a brief moment thought I might be dreaming.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   I can't play soccer, but maybe my daughters will one day. Maybe
they'll be paid the same respect, the same dollars as men. Maybe
one day I can imagine ALL the world's doors open to them the way a
mother does for her sons.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe one day I won't have to dream. It'll just be.

 &HT;    New site is considered for Cox headquarters
 &HT;    By Sallye Salter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A Sandy Springs site entangled in a zoning battle over
a proposed high-density residential, retail and office project
could instead become the location of the headquarters of Cox
Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   The 29-acre Central Park tract is among a half dozen sites that
Cox is considering for its headquarters complex, according to Cox
Senior Vice President Tim Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which owns The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, said
last month that it plans either to double the size of its
300,000-square-foot existing headquarters or build a
600,000-square-foot complex elsewhere in the metro area.
</P>
<P>
   The Sandy Springs property is zoned for high-rise office
development.
</P>
<P>
   Wood Partners, which has contracted to buy the property, has run
into stiff neighborhood opposition to its proposal to rezone the
land for a mixed-use development that would include a 30-story
residential tower, apartments, a movie theater and a hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Cox representatives are meeting with several neighborhood groups
to gauge community sentiment over the company's plan for office
development, which could be constructed under existing zoning,
Hughes added.
</P>
<P>
   Under the purchase contract, Hughes said, ``We have the
opportunity to step into Wood's shoes, and that is what we are
going to consider.''
</P>
<P>
   The property, owned by New York-based Equitable Cos., is part of
a much larger tract zoned in the 1980s for a high-density complex
planned by Texas-based Vantage Properties.
</P>
<P>
   Cox has hired Cousins Properties as developer for its
headquarters project and is still evaluating its options, Hughes
said. ``We hope to have something resolved very soon,'' he said.

ONLINE RETAILING EXPECTED TO FAVOR ESTABLISHED STORES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   North American consumers should more than double their spending
at retail Web sites in 1999, but most of that spending is likely to
be with retailers that may already be well-known for their
brick-and-mortar stores, according to a new study.
</P>
<P>
   Prepared by Shop.org, a trade association of Internet retailers,
and the Boston Consulting Group, the study projects that consumers
will spend $36 billion at retail Web sites this year, up from $14.9
billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   To put matters into perspective, one consumer retail dollar in
200 was spent at e-commerce Web sites in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   By now, nearly everyone is familiar with the rags-to-riches
legend of Amazon.com, the bookseller and an on-line auctioneer (and
now toy seller) that has so dazzled Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, such Web-only retailers as Amazon accounted for
only slightly more than a third of estimated on-line sales in 1998,
the Shop.org study concluded.
</P>
<P>
   A much bigger chunk of business came from retailers that were
selling their wares in brick-and-mortar stores or through catalogs
long before they established e-commerce Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people think e-commerce is mainly being done by Web-only
businesses, but 62 percent of the $14.9 billion of on-line revenues
in 1998 came from retailers who had businesses that predated the
Web,'' said David Pecaut, senior vice president of the Boston
Consulting Group. ``These catalog, call centers, and
brick-and-mortar retailers are a growing force behind the continued
rapid growth of on-line retail.''
</P>
<P>
   Web-only retailers thrive in the collectibles and auction
market, the study said. Web-only retailers also do well selling
commodity items such as books and music CDs.
</P>
<P>
   But when consumers want to buy clothes, computers, or consumer
electronics, they gravitate toward retailers they know from the
mall or from catalogs they get in their mailbox.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the Internet mystique is that it empowers the little
guy. With the right mix of smarts and chutzpah, a solo entrepreneur
can challenge a Wal-Mart with a Web site that draws customers from
all over the world _ or so the theory goes.
</P>
<P>
   While there's always room for a clever newcomer, the reality may
be somewhat different, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring arguments the two groups have made in earlier
reports, the new study suggested that a handful of Web sites
continues to draw a large share of on-line retail dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the top 10 e-commerce Web sites accounted for 43
percent of on-line revenues, the study found, and the top 50 sites
accounted for 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate development, the National Retail Federation and
Forrester Research Inc. of Cambridge, Mass. announced plans to
create a quarterly index that will track on-line retail trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet economy has passed through its infancy and
entered the next phase of development,'' Forrester Research
president George F. Colony said in a statetment. ``To develop an
effective on-line strategy in a rapidly expanding and highly
competitive marketplace, retailers need a complete picture of how
the market is evolving.''

SIMS RESIGNS AS CHIEF OF CAMBRIDGE TECHNOLOGY PARTNERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   James K. Sims, chief executive of Cambridge Technology Partners
Inc. since its founding eight years ago, surprised Wall Street
analysts Monday by announcing his resignation, effective June 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the next few years, the company is going to heavily focus
on operations, while my strengths are on building businesses,
getting them started, working with employees and customers,'' said
the 52-year-old Sims. ``I guess, I saw it was my time to leave. And
I plan on spending August with my family, and my new grandchildren.
In September, I'll look around and start all over again. I think
that's pretty cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Sims the information-technology consulting firm grew to
4,600 employees in 53 offices worldwide, with revenue last year of
$612 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Cambridge, Mass. company said Jack Messman will succeed Sims
on Aug. 1. Messman was chairman and chief executive of Pacific
Resources Group Inc., an independent oil and gas exploration and
production company.
</P>
<P>
   Sims said he informed the board of directors several months ago
that he no longer wanted to be chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Cambridge Technology Partners, which challenged the consulting
business by offering fixed-price, fixed-time contracts lasting six
to nine months, grew quickly during most of the 1990s but stumbled
in the last 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   An early user of client-server computing, the company developed
a proprietary library of software that it would tailor to
individual clients. It specializes in bringing users from several
different departments together to build a consensus before creating
and introducing new software. Cambridge Technology Partners became
one of the fastest growing Massachusetts companies during the early
to mid-1990s. It was also among the biggest recruiters for local
software talent on college campuses.
</P>
<P>
   But the pell-mell growth took its toll on the company, which
needed to restructure operations last year, revamp its sales force
and focus on achieving new levels of growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company probably needs a management team with a different
skill set now, '' said Brian Maimone, director and senior analyst
at ING Barings Ltd., a New York investment and brokerage firm.
``All the raw materials, from its assets to its methodologies are
there, it just has to be reorganized in a different way.''
</P>
<P>
   Maimone said the appointment of Messman, who does not come from
the consulting industry ``is a real question mark.''
</P>
<P>
   Sims's announcement had little effect on the company's stock,
which has fallen steeply from its 52-week high of 55 1/2 last July.
It closed Monday at 19 15/16, down 5/16 on the Nasdaq exchange.

<P>
   Convergence Pharmaceuticals Inc., formed four months ago by four
researchers whose work includes some of the most promising recent
developments in cancer treatment, was sold to Ilex Oncology Inc.
for $10 million in Ilex stock Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were at the crossroads of raising venture capital money and
looking at three companies wanting to acquire us, including Ilex,''
said Glenn Rice, chief executive of Boston-based Convergence.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in Convergence, which has 12 employees, has been
centered on the research of its scientific founders, Dr. Vikas
Sukhatme and Raghu Kalluri, who were developing compounds to starve
cancerous tumors by shutting down blood-vessel growth. Both are
also researchers at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston
and faculty members at Harvard Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   Just how cancer tumors establish a blood supply, a field known
as angiogenesis, and figuring out how to shut down blood vessel
growth, is one of the hottest areas of medical development.
</P>
<P>
   The pioneering angiogenesis work of Dr. Judah Folkman, a cancer
researcher at Children's Hospital, drew worldwide headlines 14
months ago. Folkman has licensed two promising compounds to
Convergence's main competitor, EntreMed Inc. of Rockville, Md.
Sukhatme, a colleague of Folkman's at Harvard Medical School, was
the first researcher to validate Folkman's key findings, which had
been questioned by some medical researchers last year.
</P>
<P>
   Rice contends Convergence's drug candidates are more powerful
and easier to manufacture than Entremed's. The Ilex acquisition, he
said, will enable Convergence to get its drugs into animal and
human clinical trials much faster than if it had remained
independent.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Ilex is getting six compounds from Convergence,
according to Richard Love, Ilex's president. Love said his
4-year-old firm, based in San Antonio, has nine other cancer drugs
in various stages of testing.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Convergence shareholders received 1 million
Ilex shares, worth about $10 million based on Friday's closing
price of 9 15/16. In addition, Convergence's founders, including
Dr. Ralph Weichselbaum of the University of Chicago, and Dr. Donald
Kufe, deputy director of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, can earn
up to an additional one million Ilex shares if some of the proposed
Convergence drugs reach certain clinical trial milestones,
according to Rice and Love.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Ilex is hoping to announce this summer a major
pharmaceutical partner to market and distribute a promising
leukemia-fighting drug called Campath. That drug aimed at the
estimated 60,000 adult Americans was developed by LeukoSite Inc. of
Cambridge and tested by Ilex under a joint venture announced in May
1997. Love said Ilex will file for US Food and Drug Administration
approval of Campath later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Ilex shares closed at 9 29/32, down 1/32, on the Nasdaq Stock
Market.

BRUINS REWARD WILSON WITH A TWO-YEAR CONTRACT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The Bruins re-signed one free agent and took a chance
on two others Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Right wing Landon Wilson, who was a force in Providence's run to
the Calder Cup championship, agreed on a two-year deal, while
defenseman Vratislav Cech signed a three-year contract, and left
wing Joe Hulbig inked a one-year pact.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, 24, will go into his third full season with the Bruins
after being acquired from Colorado (along with defenseman Anders
Myrvold) Nov. 22, 1996. In return, the Avalanche received the
Bruins' No. 1 pick, which they used to select Robyn Regehr. Last
spring, Regehr was dealt to Calgary in the deal for Theo Fleury,
and his career was jeopardized recently when he was injured in a
serious traffic accident.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's career with Boston has been hampered by inconsistency.
But after the way he played at the end of the season and in the
postseason, the team is encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Landon played well for us at the end of last season, and we
are looking for him to contribute on a more consistent basis this
year,'' said vice president of hockey operations and assistant
general manager Mike O'Connell. ``Cech and Hulbig are big and
strong, and they will be given every chance at training camp to
make our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson had three goals and 6 points in 22 regular-season games
in Boston this year. He added one goal and 2 points in eight
playoff games. With Providence, Wilson had 31 goals and 53 points
in 48 regular-season games before potting seven goals and 8 points
in 11 playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-old Hulbig is a former first-round pick, taken No.
13 overall by Edmonton in 1992. After four years at Providence
College, he played most of the last three seasons with the Oilers'
American Hockey League affiliate in Hamilton. Last year, Hulbig,
who is 6 feet 3 inches and 215 pounds, tallied 22 goals and 46
points in 76 regular-season games and then added two goals and 6
points in 11 postseason contests. In 24 NHL games with Edmonton
over the last three seasons, Hulbig has two goals and 4 points.
</P>
<P>
   Cech, 20, was taken with the 56th pick in the 1997 draft by
Florida. The Panthers didn't sign him, and after passing through
June's draft, he became an unrestricted free agent. He played the
last three seasons with Kitchener of the Ontario League, and he had
20 goals, 93 points, and 211 penalty minutes in 186 career junior
games.

HOSPITALS FACE $724M CUT IN MEDICARE FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Massachusetts' 60 community hospitals will suffer a
five-year, $724 million cut in Medicare payment rates by 2003,
industry analysts said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 40 percent of the revenue loss will come from just 10
hospitals, according to numbers obtained from the Massachusetts
Hospital Association.
</P>
<P>
   The reductions, which hospitals are fighting to roll back at
least partially, amount to a 9 percent reduction in federal
Medicare payments compared to the $8.1 billion that Massachusetts
community hospitals would have received between 1998 and 2003
without the scheduled cutbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're frankly running out of ways to adjust,'' said John D.
Day, chief executive of Southcoast Health System in New Bedford,
the hardest hit community hospital in terms of absolute revenue
reductions, with a projected $62 million year loss in Medicare
revenues between 1998 and 2003. ``We're being pushed to the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Medicare accounts for 55 percent of Southcoast's annual
revenues, a high proportion that Day said helps explain why the
three-hospital campus will suffer a dollar impact $22 million
higher than the next-hardest hit institution, Cape Cod Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Two dozen Massachusetts hospital executives plan to take their
case to Capitol Hill and the White House Wednesday as part of a
national community hospital lobbying effort that seeks to blunt
some of the looming effects of the Medicare cutbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to start to see the unraveling of the very
programs hospitals were asked to develop over the last 10 years,''
said Ronald Hollander, president of the hospital association. He
was referring to services such as home health care,
``transitional'' care from hospital to home, and outpatient care
for elders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hospitals can't continue to absorb cuts of this magnitude,''
Hollander said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Balanced Budget Act of 1997 imposed the biggest
reduction in Medicare payment rates in the program's 34-year
history. The law was designed to reduce Medicare payments by $115
billion over five years, but industry officials say the complex
provisions in the statute overshot the goal by almost double, or
$220 billion.
</P>
<P>
   If the Balanced Budget Act had not been passed, payments to all
Massachusetts hospitals _ including both teaching and community
hospitals _ would have been $1.7 billion higher between fiscal 1998
and 2003, industry analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   The state's 13 major teaching hospitals account for more than
half the reductions in Medicare payment rates, since they are
disproportionately affected by cutbacks in federal support for
training interns and residents.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the 1997 law is modified, Massachusetts' community
hospitals will have to live with Medicare payments that are
essentially flat, in absolute dollars, over the five-year period.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you figure in inflation, it ends up being a 13 percent
reduction in Medicare payments,'' said Robert Mechanic, a hospital
association financial analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Community hospital officials said they will have to cut medical
services and lay off workers if Congress refuses to modify the
impact of the 1997 cuts.
</P>
<P>
   One program in jeopardy at Carney Hospital in Dorchester, for
instance, is a ``transitional care'' unit that helps elderly
patients prepare for return to their homes or to nursing homes. The
program currently costs about $560 a day per patient, but Medicare
pays $270 a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This service is very popular with patients, but we're losing
money on it,'' said Joyce Murphy, Carney's president.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, Carney has cut 93 positions out of a staff of
1,200, mostly through attrition. But further staff reductions will
be inevitable without congressional action, Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   In jeopardy are Carney programs that serve inner-city children
with asthma and interpreter services that serve patients who
speaking 28 different languages. In the past year, the hospital had
to close a clinic to treat patients with facial pain as part of
budget reductions totaling $4.3 million. In the coming year, Carney
will have to cut another $1.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has been cool to hospitals' pleas for
relief. In fact, President Clinton's recent Medicare reform
proposal would extend the 1997 statute's provisions in order to
help pay for proposed coverage of prescription drugs, which
Medicare does not now cover.
</P>
<P>
   However, hospital officials said they were optimistic about the
chances of some relief from the Republican-dominated Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Clinton administration continues to adopt a
show-me attitude,'' Hollander said. ``But I think policymakers are
beginning to realize that maybe they've overshot the mark.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Sager of Boston University School of Public Health did not
question the hospitals' projected Medicare losses, but he
criticized the hospital association for ``refusing to analyze the
question of which hospitals are needed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The hospital association cannot talk about the free market
when hospitals are doing well and then talk about financial
distress when it's convenient to do so,'' Sager said. ``The
challenge here is to identify which hospitals are needed to protect
the health of people in the Commonwealth and then find ways to keep
them open.''

 &HT;    Government joins suit against Columbia
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The federal government said Monday that it has joined
a whistleblower lawsuit, filed by a former Atlanta executive,
alleging widespread fraud involving Columbia/HCA Healthcare.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Steven McLendon alleges in his suit that Columbia, a
Nashville-based hospital chain, and his former employer, a unit of
Olsten Corp., participated in elaborate schemes to submit false
claims to Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   McLendon, a former vice president of operations for Olsten
Health Management, stands to gain millions if the government, which
now takes over as plaintiff, recovers a substantial amount from
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Under the federal False Claims Act, individuals can file
lawsuits on behalf of the government when they believe they have
knowledge of fraud. Whistleblower litigants are eligible to get up
to 25 percent of the money recovered by the government.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Attorney's office in Atlanta said Monday that Olsten
Corp. has agreed to pay the federal government about $51 million to
settle charges related to the billing problems. Olsten is no longer
part of the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   McLendon would receive almost $10 million of the Olsten
settlement, federal officials said.
</P>
<P>
   His original complaint alleges the defendants used inflated
management fees, reimbursed by Medicare, to help pay for Columbia's
purchases of home health care agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government was really funding Columbia's acquisitions,''
said McLendon's attorney, Marlan Wilbanks of Harmon, Smith, Bridges
&AMP; Wilbanks in Atlanta. ''We believe we have identified hundreds of
millions of dollars of fraud,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia also billed Medicare for costs of sales, marketing and
other activities that are not reimbursable under the federal
program's regulations, according to the lawsuit. In addition,
Columbia illegally billed for home-care visits to residents of
assisted-living facilities, the suit says.
</P>
<P>
   Another Olsten subsidiary, Kimberly Home Health Care, agreed to
plead guilty Monday to kickback charges in Atlanta and separate
charges in Florida, and will pay a criminal fine of $10 million,
federal officials added. The government says Kimberly paid
kickbacks to an unnamed corporation for ordering or arranging
services reimbursable by Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia declined to comment on the McLendon suit. Company
spokesman Jeff Prescott, though, said still other whistleblower
lawsuits against Columbia have yet to be unsealed, or made public.
``I don't think the unsealing of one lawsuit is a particularly
significant milestone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Olsten officials could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia contracted with Olsten to provide management services
for Columbia's home health agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to his original lawsuit, McLendon requested that Olsten
and Columbia stop the alleged illegal activities. When rebuffed,
McLendon then secretly began wearing a recording device and taped
phone conversations with Columbia officials discussing the alleged
activities, Wilbanks said. McLendon, a former Alpharetta resident,
filed his then-sealed complaint in U.S. District Court in Atlanta
in 1997, and continued to cooperate with federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   He left Olsten in September 1997, and now lives in Florida.
McLendon could not be reached for comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit and settlement announcements follow the criminal
fraud convictions earlier this month of two Columbia managers in
Florida. The legal actions have suddenly energized the federal
government's two-year pursuit of billing fraud allegations against
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Prescott said Columbia has been holding ongoing talks about a
possible settlement with the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The Columbia probe is a centerpiece of the government's
multi-agency crackdown on health-care fraud. The government's
Operation Restore Trust campaign has led to hundreds of criminal
convictions and the recovery of billions of dollars. Because of
this effort, health-care providers increased compliance with
federal Medicare rules, said Nina Hunt, First Assistant U.S.
Attorney in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals and doctors, though, have criticized federal tactics
as overly aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   Another government whistleblower aided in the Tampa prosecution
that resulted in a federal jury this month finding two Columbia
managers guilty on six counts of Medicare fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The case also involved submitting false expense claims to the
government for reimbursement. They were the first guilty verdicts
resulting from the government's investigation into Columbia, and
were a boost to prosecutors elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   After that probe began in 1997, Columbia's hard-charging chief
executive, Richard Scott, resigned. The company has since sold off
hospitals, surgery centers and almost all of its home care
business, and taken a much lower profile in the marketplace. It now
owns 220 hospitals, down from about 340. Columbia operates 20
hospitals in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   In metro Atlanta, the company this year launched a venture with
nonprofit Emory Healthcare. The deal moved eight Columbia hospitals
and five surgery centers into a for-profit organization, where
Emory would oversee clinical performance, and Columbia would run
the day-to-day operations.

A RESORT SERVES NATURE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 25) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hard to think that the two resorts I visited last month
could be in the same universe, let alone the same state. A family
reunion took me to Disney World in Orlando, where three dozen of us
had breakfast with Mickey, among several otherworldly events. When
the family said farewells on Sunday, I drove north 75 miles on
Florida's Turnpike and on Marion Country roads to the Refuge at
Ocklawaha.
</P>
<P>
   At the Refuge, an eco-resort, I slept on a top-notch mattress in
a small new cabin with windows and screened doors flung open to the
sound of frogs and peepers, fading at dawn to rich bird cries. One
night, I took a canoe trip with Bruce Beckwith, the boating guide,
into the Ocklawaha Marsh to glimpse a full moon through high cloud
cover and to pick out by flashlight some beady alligator eyes in
tall grasses at water level.
</P>
<P>
   I ate plain meals at a communal table, rode a horse through the
forest, swam among fish in the crystal-clear Silver River and got
the closest I can to serenity.
</P>
<P>
   The new Refuge, which had been open only three weeks when I
visited, &UR;  &LR; expects to take eco-tourism further than any resort in
Florida, or perhaps for that matter, in the continental United
States.
</P>
<P>
   After having been a buzzword for a decade or so, eco-tourism and
environmentally aware resort and hotel management are beginning to
achieve a broader reach. Some recent signs, including a United
Nations conference on the subject in May, indicate that there may
be more steps being taken to recycle and conserve resources, and
particularly to develop resorts that pay attention to a site's
``carrying capacity'' _ its water supply, its ability to withstand
vehicular traffic, its ways of dealing with waste.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, Robert A. Christianson, the director of operations
for the St. Johns River Water Management District, explained the
Refuge resort's plan. His state agency has signed a 50-year lease
to the resort, almost in the center of its 6,000 acres along the
Ocklawaha River.
</P>
<P>
   The whole area is open to all visitors for hiking, biking,
boating and riding. Beyond is the Ocala National Forest, meaning a
half-million acres of public property is available as a nature
preserve for guests and day visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The Refuge, a year-round resort whose first 10 cabins _ all but
one contain two rooms with baths _ have conventional wiring to feed
wall air-conditioning and heating units, lights and ceiling fans,
is not so environmentally light-footed as it will be when Stanley
Selengut, who heads it, has built his special ``eco-tents.'' These
units on stilts are modular, with wood framing and walls that
combine screens and solid panels. The panels can be switched as
seasons require.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the ``tent'' elements are made from recycled materials _
what one aide called ``Stanley's house made of garbage.'' In their
most evolved form, these units can operate virtually independent of
conventional power and water sources, for example, by using
composting toilets. Selengut expects to have some of these in place
by November, for the high season at the Refuge.
</P>
<P>
   This future is hinted at by small solar panels at the Refuge
that circulate water in pools for birds. But the 19 cabin bathrooms
look like those in hotels, save for the soap and shampoo
dispensers, which avoid the overpackaging needed for individual
soaps and shampoos.
</P>
<P>
   Selengut, creator of four sophisticated eco-resorts in the
Virgin Islands, hopes to put eco-tents at the lip of the Ocklawaha
marsh to give birders 24 hours of observation time. ``Most hotels
try to protect you from experience,'' Selengut said. ``We try to
put you into the experience.''
</P>
<P>
   At the refuge, little veils the environment around you. One
rainy afternoon I propped my feet up on my screened porch and
listened. No radios. No television. No automobiles. Guests' cars
are left in a paddock near the canoe storage area, and guests walk
from place to place, or ride with luggage in the staff's silent
electric carts. By day, I had sightlines along the sandy ground
through the heavy arches of the live oaks, and could see only
porches beyond.
</P>
<P>
   I was not without electricity, however, even on my porch; I was
able to put my laptop on the table and plug into a water-tight wall
outlet. On clouded nights, I could see virtually nothing, and
picked my way around the grounds with the flashlight left by my
bedside.
</P>
<P>
   The Refuge and its staff were establishing activity schedules
and operating rules: for example, should the electric carts be
driven under the trees? But it is clear what formulates the
decisions and where the Refuge will go.
</P>
<P>
   Selengut's Maho Bay, built as a private enterprise in 1975 in
the St. John's National Park, was the prototype for environmentally
sensitive beach resorts: washing, or gray, water was recycled onto
the greenery, and the beach below is bare of vending booths and
bars.
</P>
<P>
   Since Maho Bay opened, its profitability has allowed Selengut to
open three more resorts on the island, some more advanced than
others: places with solar panels, self-operated pumps for hot
shower water, shops that turn discarded Arizona iced-tea bottles
into blue Art Noveau vases.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Of the Refuge, his first project on the mainland, he said: ``We
do not plan to be all things to all people. People who want us will
come for what we offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonnie Williams, the resort manager, was explaining why she
scheduled two hours for a one-hour trail ride through the Ocala
National Forest: the guests needed to become familiar with their
mounts, learn to saddle them and then reverse the procedure
afterward. At the Refuge, she said, the horse program, like
everything else, is intended to provide understanding and
interpretation of the ecology and history of the area; horses and
cattle are rooted in the settling of Central Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Williams says the word ``cracker,'' which is used in the
brochures and elsewhere to describe the new guest cabins, derives
from the cattle drivers who historically cracked whips in Florida
ranching country.
</P>
<P>
   As for housekeeping, the resort's notice says such services can
be requested, but that otherwise, privacy will not be disturbed. A
broom and dustpan are in each room ``to help with the sand,'' a
notice says, and I made my bed.
</P>
<P>
   The Refuge, a 52-acre former corn farm in the water management
district, was set up by the Florida Audubon Society with financial
help from the Pew Charitable Trusts of Philadelphia, but it could
not get the place running with the money it had. Selengut signed on
and, bringing in private financing, got things rolling again.
</P>
<P>
   The resort thus represents a project with five sponsors, public,
private and voluntary. The landlord is the state, whose agent is
the water management district, one of five Florida has created to
salvage and restore lakes, wetlands and river channels destroyed
for farmland.
</P>
<P>
   Major roles were played by the Audubon Society and Pew.
Selengut's Maho Bay Camps Inc., a profit-making organization with
far-reaching ecological goals, brought in the Excel Legacy Corp., a
San Diego real estate company, which has signed on for a year to
create Florida Legacy Lodges to operate the Refuge.
</P>
<P>
   The varying elements of the Refuge blend. The resort acreage
runs right up to a 10-mile circular levee that once walled the
Ocklawaha River out of the huge corn farm. ``That's the history of
Florida,'' Christianson said. ``Everywhere it was drained for
planting.''
</P>
<P>
   But then five years ago the water district purchased and
bulldozed the farm, restoring the water flow. The marsh began to
regrow, recreating habitat for birds and animals. Now with an
environmentally oriented resort bringing in people to enjoy the
rejuvenation, the water district gave Selengut permission to build
a bird-watching platform on stilts on the levee; the investment is
deducted from his rental.
</P>
<P>
   A composting center is on the way, with help from Audubon, which
will also run tours and provide further plantings. Flowers and
trees not native to the area are being removed, to strengthen the
environment against storms and lure back the native birds and
butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   Concrete-block bunkers built years ago to hold the farm's silage
will be taken out, but Selengut looks hopefully at a leftover
corrugated metal storage barn as a future place for artisans and
workers to turn trash _ bottles, cans and plastic _ into usable
building materials or items for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Because he believes _ the idea coincides with the United Nations
concept of ``sustainable development'' _ that local people should
benefit from a resort's operation, canoeing and horseback riding
are provided by local concessionaires who are already in the
business and who shift equipment and animals onto the property.
</P>
<P>
   Selengut also plans to get local artists, including musicians
who play at lounges like Gator Joe's in Ocklawaha, to entertain in
the main lodge, where meals are served and slide shows held.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Selengut, whose resorts steadily garner awards for
alternatives to the environmentally destructive aspects of resort
living, is no longer entirely alone in his concerns.
</P>
<P>
   On Upper Matecumbe Key, 90 minutes south of Miami, is the Cheeca
Lodge, which has modified its management practices in an
environmental direction since 1988. It recycles its waste,
including 30,000 gallons a day of gray water for the grounds and
golf course. But it is conventional in many ways, providing hair
dryers, color televisions and cassette players in the rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The Cheeca Lodge, along with many other hotels, is now leaving
cards in rooms telling guests how to indicate which towels should
be replaced, and offering the option of changing the sheets every
other day instead of every day. Le Centre Sheraton in Montreal has
a hang card saying that towels in the tub will be replaced, not
those on the rack.
</P>
<P>
   At the Grovesnor Resort at Disney World, in addition to a towel
notice, a card said: ``Please place glass, plastic and paper
materials next to your guest room trash can. Our staff will gladly
have these item recycled for you.''
</P>
<P>
   The paper napkins we got in Walt Disney World were tan and
marked ``100 percent recycled paper,'' although they seemed
negligible in a trashcan that was otherwise overflowing with
plastic cups and delicatessen containers.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 10 years, the American Hotel and Motel Association
has been presenting its enviro-management awards to properties that
take major steps in this area. This year, the Arbor Day Farm Lied
Conference Center in Nebraska City, Neb., got the award for small
properties for its architecture, with heating, cooling, pool and
laundry powered by efficient wood-burning, and a shuttle powered by
soybean bio-diesel.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The hotel group gave its large-property award to the Holiday Inn
in Phoenix-Tempe, where employees themselves have focused on
putting into practice more environmentally sensitive management
practices in guest rooms, lighting, laundry and recycling. The
Cheeca Lodge has also won an industry award.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the United Nations sponsored a conference on
sustainable development, with three days devoted to tourism. Issues
discussed ranged from the loss of coral reefs to child
prostitution. The International Hotel and Restaurant Association
played a major role in these talks, and has been presenting awards
to resorts that it finds to be making responsible efforts to
recycle materials and protect the surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   Joint projects between voluntary organizations and private
tourism companies, as exemplified at the Refuge, seem likely to
expand. In May, Abercrombie &AMP; Kent Hotels and Resorts, a new
division of the Illinois-based tour operator, announced a joint
effort with the Nature Conservancy, an international environmental
group.
</P>
<P>
   They will develop small eco-lodges in the Western Hemisphere,
``allowing visitors to enjoy unique, pristine areas while enabling
the local community to protect and manage these areas for the
future.'' Sites in Belize, Brazil, Peru and the Western United
States are reported under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Nature Conservancy, its state chapters have
operated very small lodges for some time. This is the first time,
according to Douglas Meyer, a spokesman, that it has joined with a

   The Refuge at Ocklawaha uses the address 14835 Southeast 85th
Street, Ocklawaha, Fla. 32179, although it is really in the wilds.
The phone numbers are (877) 862-8873, which is toll free, and (352)
288-2233, or fax (352) 288-6369. Reservations are taken through the
Maho Bay Camps office in New York, (800) 392-9004, fax (212)
861-6210, because the Refuge has only a few telephone lines. Ask
the resort to fax you directions: mine were precise and all I had
to do was set the trip odometer at each turn.
</P>
<P>
   The off-season rate is $100 a night for a room for one or two,
with private bath and porch and Continental breakfast. The rate is
being discounted 20 percent, to $80 a night, through September. The
high-season rate, starting Oct. 1, is $125 for one or two people,
$20 for an extra adult, $10 for a child under 12. Some units have
an extra bedroom in the middle of the two regular units that can be
rented as part of either; it has no bathroom and is $50 more a
night.
</P>
<P>
   Lunch in the lodge dining room costs up to $10; dinner is up to
$20, depending on what is served: there is no menu, although there
may be a choice, for example, between catfish and red meat. As of
mid-July, the resort had not yet received a license for wine or
beer, but there is plenty of ice, both at the cabins and in the
main lodge.
</P>
<P>
   Use of the swimming pool and unescorted hiking are free. Guided
bird or nature walks are $10. Bike rentals are $15 a day. Trail
rides are $35 an hour; there is to be a three-day program for
beginners involving care of the horse and an hour of ring riding
daily, for $150.
</P>
<P>
   Canoe and kayak rentals are $15 a half day or an evening, and
$25 a full day. A five-hour interpretive river trip on a pontoon
boat, with a box lunch, is $40. Turning into the spring-fed Silver
River, absolutely clear to the bottom, from the brown Ocklawaha, is
a delight.

3 FORMER BANKERS TRUST EXECUTIVES INDICTED ON DIVERSION CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three former executives of Bankers Trust Corp. were
indicted Monday on federal criminal charges that they diverted
$15.5 million of unclaimed customer money into the bank's own
accounts from 1993 to 1996 to lift their department's financial
results.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Kingdon, a former Bankers Trust managing director who
headed the bank's client processing services division, and two
subordinates were each charged in U.S. District Court in Manhattan
with one count of conspiracy, 12 counts of misapplication of bank
funds and 12 counts of falsifying books and records.
</P>
<P>
   The charges came in connection with accounting irregularities
first uncovered by bank examiners in 1994 and acknowledged by
Bankers Trust executives in 1996. Prosecutors contended that
Kingdon and the subordinates routinely used money that was left
unclaimed in customer accounts at Bankers Trust as a ``slush fund''
to cover up shortfalls in their division's expected revenue and
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Bankers Trust agreed to pay fines totaling
$63.5 million after it pleaded guilty to criminal charges that
senior officers and employees, who were unidentified at the time,
had illegally diverted $19.1 million in unclaimed checks and other
credits owed to customers into the bank's accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Such unclaimed money is common at most banks, remaining in the
bank's control after customers fail to cash checks for payment of
dividends, interest or principal on securities or fail to collect
distributions from benefit and pension plans.
</P>
<P>
   Also indicted on the same charges as Kingdon were Kenneth
Goglia, the former controller of the client processing services
division, and Harvey Plante, a former vice president in the unit.
The division administered employee benefit and pension plans and
provided services related to securities transactions, accounting
for a substantial portion of the annual profits of Bankers Trust.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment contends that the three men, each of whom plans
to contest the charges, regularly dipped into the unclaimed money
to meet budgeted revenue and profit levels. In one instance, money
was diverted to pay some costs of Christmas parties thrown for
Bankers Trust senior executives in 1994, according to the
indictment.
</P>
<P>
   All three defendants, who are scheduled to be arraigned before a
federal magistrate on Thursday, face a maximum sentence of five
years in prison and a $250,000 fine on the conspiracy charge, plus
30 years in prison and a $1 million fine on each of the 24 charges
of misapplication of bank funds and falsifying books and records.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment was announced by Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney
for the Southern District of New York. The Securities and Exchange
Commission also announced Monday that it had filed civil charges in
U.S. District Court in New York contending that the three former
managers violated securities laws.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Federal Reserve announced that it had filed a
notice of intent to bar the three men from the banking industry for
breaching their fiduciary duty to the bank and its customers and
for engaging in unsafe banking practices.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's indictments account for most but not all of the
diversion that was the subject of Bankers Trust's guilty plea.
Federal prosecutors said Monday that their investigation was
continuing. Bankers Trust was acquired earlier this year by
Deutsche Bank AG.
</P>
<P>
   All three men plan to contest the charges, their lawyers said.
John Carroll, of the law firm Rogers &AMP; Wells, said Goglia, who is
now self-employed, would plead not guilty on Thursday. ``I think
that the government was misguided in bringing the indictment, and
Mr. Goglia expects to fight and be vindicated after trial,''
Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Souther, a lawyer at the law firm Brown &AMP; Wood who
represents Plante, said he thought his client ``is being treated as
a scapegoat'' for Bankers Trust's actions. He described Plante as
``a midlevel employee'' who ``was not a decision maker'' at the
bank.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Arkin, who represents Kingdon, said in a statement,
``Mr. Kingdon performed ably and honestly as a senior executive of
Bankers Trust. He never profited from the claimed conduct and never
intended to do anything remotely violative of any law or anyone's
interests.'' Kingdon resigned from the bank in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being charged with the same counts as Kingdon,
Goglia and Plante were also charged with two counts of conversion
of employee benefit plans. On each of those counts, they each face
an additional five years in prison and a fine of $250,000.

TRAFFIC JAMS LED TO 3-HOUR DELAY IN KENNEDY TAKEOFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He had planned to depart New Jersey's Essex County Airport
around 5:30 p.m. on Friday, but traffic tie-ups kept John F.
Kennedy Jr. from getting to the aiport sooner, delaying his flight
three hours and forcing him to fly at night, said a friend and
pilot who uses the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were busy people, and they were usually running behind,''
the friend, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told the Globe
Monday. But, he added, Kennedy had wanted to leave ``at 5:30 or
6.''
</P>
<P>
   Family friends had told the Globe on Sunday that they believed
Kennedy had planned to leave when he did.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the situation, the flight instructor whom Kennedy
often relied on to accompany him on flights was vacationing in
Europe the day of Kennedy's doomed trip to Martha's Vineyard, his
friend and fellow pilot said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was a ``very cautious'' pilot, said the friend, who
frequently flies out of Essex County Airport in Fairfield, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy car traffic trying to get out of New York City on a summer
Friday was one reason for the delay in taking off, the friend said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of traffic in the tunnel and it does not take
that much to get three hours behind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Had Kennedy taken off for the 125-mile flight with plenty of
daylight left, he could have made the crossing over water to
Martha's Vineyard with little trouble, experienced pilots said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, his plane is believed to have crashed just off the
island's coast, killing Kennedy; his wife, Carolyn Bessette
Kennedy; and her older sister, Lauren Bessette.
</P>
<P>
   If the night had been clear, Kennedy would have seen the sweep
of Buzzard's Bay off to his right and the lights of the Vineyard
ahead of him as he approached the island from Westerly, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   In daylight or if the night had been clear, Kennedy should have
been able to keep the horizon in sight and maintain control of the
plane.
</P>
<P>
   But with darkness approaching, haze blanketing the coastline and
fog obscuring Martha's Vineyard, Kennedy _ who was only licensed to
fly under visual conditions in which pilots rely on being able to
see the horizon or spotting clues from the ground _ was heading
into weather conditions he was not adequately prepared to deal
with.
</P>
<P>
   If pilots rated only for visual conditions cannot see the
horizon or the ground below them, they can quickly lose control of
the airplane, some pilots said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years ago, when I was only rated visual, I got lost in
the clouds,'' said pilot Michael Danziger. ``I looked down at my
map, and the next thing I knew I was covered in clouds. I tried to
peer through the clouds or look down through them and in one minute
I had lost 1,100 feet of elevation and was off my heading.''
</P>
<P>
   Danziger radioed air-traffic controllers for help and was
directed back to safety.
</P>
<P>
   In many other countries night flights are restricted to pilots
licensed to fly by instruments alone.
</P>
<P>
   The US military trains all its pilots to fly using instruments.
But the federal government allows private pilots like Kennedy _ who
lack an instrument rating _ to fly at night if visibility is three
miles or more and the cloud ceiling is above 1,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a very hazy night, with no horizon out there, even though
it would not be instrument meteorological conditions in terms of
flying, it is absolutely instrument conditions,'' said Bruce
Landsberg, a flight instructor and executive director of the
Air-Safety Foundation at the Aircraft Owners and Pilots
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had he flown in daytime, (Kennedy's flight) would have worked,
but VFR pilots cannot and should not fly in instrument
conditions,'' Landsberg added.
</P>
<P>
   In instrument conditions, pilots must fly relying only on their
plane's cockpit equipment _ the artifical horizon, the vertical
airspeed indicator, the gyrocompass, the airspeed indicator and the
altimeter.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy had passed the written examination required for an
instrument rating, but still had to take a lengthy practical
examination with a Federal Aviation Administration examiner.
</P>
<P>
   The test includes actual flying by instruments and exercises in
a flight simulator to prove a pilot can use instruments to
stabilize a plane that is out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots with private licenses have to receive three hours of
instrument flight training and must prove they can perform a gentle
180 degree turn in case they fly into a cloud.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy had a basic understanding of instrument flight, but it
may not have been enough to help him that night.
</P>
<P>
   When a pilot loses outside references, like the ground or the
horizon, the plane quickly drifts in one direction.
</P>
<P>
   If the turn continues uncorrected, the plane can quickly head
into a downward spiral, and the only warning _ other than from
gauges _ that something is wrong would come from the sound of
increased airspeed rushing by the cockpit, Landsberg said.
</P>
<P>
   While Landsberg does not favor more federal regulation of
general aviation, flying in uncertain weather at night is
undoubtedly dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the fatal accident rate for private planes flying in
the daytime under visual conditions was 0.88 for every 100,000
hours of flight, but there were nearly three times as many fatal
accidents flying at night in poor weather.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known if poor visibility made Kennedy disoriented, but
radar tapes show his plane quickly got into trouble over open
water. It descended from 2,200 feet to to 1,100 feet in 14 seconds
_ a rate of descent of 4,700 feet per minute. Pilots familiar with
the craft said a normal rate of descent is 500 to 700 feet per
minute.
</P>
<P>
   What has Kennedy's friend puzzled, as well as Danziger, who owns
a Piper Saratoga II HP, the same model Kennedy was flying on
Friday, is why Kennedy did not use his on-board automatic pilot.
</P>
<P>
   The automatic pilot would have kept the plane on its heading
while keeping the plane's wings level _ critical to maintaining
control. It also could have controlled the plane's rate of descent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a really safe way to descend,'' Danziger said. ``All you
need to do is manage the power. It really buys you time in a
complex airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   And if Kennedy was unsure of his position, he could have radioed
for assistance from air-traffic controllers. But he never made
contact with the Martha's Vineyard Airport tower.

 &HT;    Southern Co. quarterly profit up 16%
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Southern Co. said second-quarter net income rose more
than 16 percent primarily due to improved performance by the
utility company's new unregulated businesses.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, Southern made a surprise announcement
Monday that Tom Boren, the president of the subsidiary that manages
those operations, is taking early retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Net income rose to $314 million, or 45 cents a share, for the
quarter that ended June 30, compared with $270 million, or 39 cents
a share, a year earlier. Analysts polled by Zacks Investment had
expected a profit of 39 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Second-quarter revenue fell to $2.79 billion, compared with
$2.91 billion a year ago. The decline was attributed to mild
weather that lessened demand for power in the company's
Southeastern service territory.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Energy Inc., the unit spearheading the utility holding
company's moves into unregulated markets inside and outside the
United States, accounted for $77 million of Southern's
second-quarter net income, compared with $35 million a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strategy has been to expand our growth in the competitive
energy supply business, and Southern Energy continues to help us to
do that successfully and profitably,'' said A.W. ``Bill'' Dahlberg,
chairman and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Boren, 50, has led SEI since 1992 and presided over its
phenomenal growth. Dahlberg praised Boren's contributions, and a
spokesman for the CEO said Dahlberg ``wanted him to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   No future plans other than early retirement were announced for
Boren, who was traveling and unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The dual announcement was made after the stock market closed.
Southern ended trading Monday up 12 1/2 cents at $26.75.
</P>
<P>
   Boren has been point man in Dahlberg's efforts to push Southern
into unregulated businesses to hedge against an expected negative
impact of eventual deregulation and increased competition in the
Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, when Boren took over SEI, the unit had 213 employees
and barely registered on Southern's balance sheet. By last year,
the work force had grown to 6,642, or 20 percent of the parent's
total.
</P>
<P>
   Boren, a 31-year Southern veteran who was one of the company's
highest-paid executives, was passed over for the presidency of
Georgia Power in a recent shake-up that put former Georgia Power
President Allen Franklin in line to succeed Dahlberg as chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Dahlberg said he would name a replacement soon. Possible
successors include SEI executives Raymond Hill, Rick Pershing, Gale
Klappa and Marce Fuller, and Dwight Evans, president of Southern's
Mississippi Power subsidiary. Boren led the SEI's 1995 hostile
takeover of a British power distributor, a ``predawn raid,'' as the
British media called it, before South Western Electricity agreed to
the acquisition. He was turned back in a subsequent move to acquire
one of Britain's largest power generators but succeeded in
acquiring Hong Kong-based Consolidated Electric Power Asia for $2.3
billion in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Southern last year took charges of $200 million to reflect a
decline in value for some of the company's early international
investments in Argentina and South America.
</P>
<P>
   But SEI is on its way to Dahlberg's objective of contributing 30
percent of Southern's net income by 2003. This year, SEI accounts
for 28 percent of the company's profits.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Co. will report on second-quarter performance on the
Internet. To hear the report, access
www.southernco.com/site/financial/earnings.asp after 1 p.m. today.

DONOR LIST SQUABBLE HIGHLIGHTS PBS FUNDRAISING DILEMMA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT AND DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Boston's WGBH-TV last week admitted swapping
donor lists with the Democratic Party, the controversy that erupted
seemed driven entirely by Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, long suspicious of a liberal bias in public
broadcasting, threatened to slash funding. Democrats leaped to the
defense, insisting the practice was legal, accusing Republicans of
using any excuse to cut off public broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   But as the dust has begun to settle, and as both parties have
been implicated in list-swapping to some degree, it has become
clear the ordeal is not just about Washington politics. It is a
window into the identity crisis of public broadcasting: How to be a
public station and a successful commercial venture at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Public Broadcasting Service came under attack in
1995 _ with Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich promising to
``zero out'' its federal money _ public broadcasters have been
encouraged to finance themselves, with the most successful stations
learning how to draw in ever more vast amounts of public donations
and corporate support. In that context, industry analysts said, it
should be no surprise that WGBH may have pushed the envelope too
far.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this is about is how far the commercial mindset has crept
into public television,'' said William Hoynes, a Vassar College
professor of sociology and author of a book on public television.
``This is part of a bigger picture. WGBH treated its customers as a
market. They packaged them and sold them in an effort to generate
new revenues.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Chester, an analyst at the Center for Media Education,
agreed: ``Over the years, public broadcasting has become more risk
averse, less public, more commercial. It has been forced to become
privatized, in a way.''
</P>
<P>
   Public broadcasting's growing commercialization has manifested
itself in a variety of ways, from the intensive merchandising of
tie-in products related to children's programs, to catering to
corporate interests with a proliferation of business shows, to the
airing of underwriter spots that differ little, if at all, from
regular commercials.
</P>
<P>
   There are the all-too-familiar examples: the Juicy Fruit
underwriting spot on WGBH, for one, that looks to many outside
analysts like a juice commercial aimed at children watching
``Arthur,'' the show the company sponsors. Then there are the
website links. With a click on a single icon on the WGBH website,
viewers can be connected instantly to the website of Digital
computers _ a virtual supermarket of computer terminals and
software sold by the WGBH sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   ``That word `underwriting' is just an obfuscatory PBS word,''
said Gary Ruskin, head of Commercial Alert, a Washington-based
consumer watchdog group founded by Ralph Nader. ``They're trying to
deny what is transparently obvious: PBS advertises. Orwell would be
proud of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the trend call it ``creeping commercialism.''
Critics say the drive for funds has distorted public broadcasting's
priorities, fundamentally altering its mission to produce
non-commercial work.
</P>
<P>
   But by not relying on commercial funds, PBS was forced to rely
on the federal government _ a sponsor, it turned out, as fickle as
any commercial underwriter who wants control over the product.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, after the GOP took control of Congress, Gingrich and
Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Larry Pressler of South Dakota
pledged to close down the public broadcasting system, a network
they accused of being both liberal and a drain on the federal
budget.
</P>
<P>
   The political attack sent shockwaves throughout PBS.
Broadcasters already strapped for funding began thinking up
creative ways to fund programs. Even today Robert Coonrod, the
president of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting _ the umbrella
organization for public television and radio _ and other public
broadcasters argue they need to partially fund themselves rather
than depend on the whims of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   And to some, including Alan D. Solomont, a member of the WGBH
board and a former finance chairman for the Democratic National
Committee, that is not entirely bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the way philanthropy has changed. People now do their
philanthropy with a much more strategic sense,'' Solomont said.
``Public broadcasting, as its needs have grown, has tried to
maintain itself and is working very hard to raise more and more
money.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the opponents of creeping commercialism, Solomont said:
``I think they could loosen up a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   But to others, creative fund-raising in public broadcasting is
one step down a slippery slope toward pandering to corporate
interests and led to the current debacle over swapping lists with
the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Republicans began training their fire on PBS, an
obsession with funding had begun to color program choices on PBS.
For instance, Hoynes, the Vassar professor, said when he
interviewed documentary producers at WGBH in the early 1990s as
part of research for his book, he found some producers were
weighing the ``fundability'' factor before deciding which projects
to undertake.
</P>
<P>
   ``The producers described a growing conflict between a
programming-driven system and a funding-driven system,'' Hoynes
said.
</P>
<P>
   To try to reverse that trend, Representative Edward J. Markey,
the Democrat from Massachusetts, plans to introduce a bill that
would tighten restrictions so credits announcing the sponsor of a
program would not resemble advertisements. The current flap over
list-swapping, Markey said, is the result of budget cuts, not
liberal bias.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be ironic if all the Republicans who seek to cure the
problems of list-swapping _ the method PBS used to generate more
revenues _ then decide to cut the PBS budget further,'' Markey
said. ``Obviously that would drive PBS to even more desperate
means.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvin F. Poussaint, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical
School, coauthored a scathing critique of PBS's marketing of
``Teletubbies'' in the May/June issue of The American Prospect
magazine, but Poussaint said GOP-led budget cutbacks put the system
in its current quandary. ``If PBS is trading off lists with donors,
they're doing it under pressure; they need to survive,'' Poussaint
said. ``The culprit in this situation may be more the government
and Congress in cutting off their money and forcing them to become
commercial.''
</P>
<P>
   At the center of both the list-swapping controversy and the
trend toward commercialism is WGBH, the Boston station that is one
of two flagship public TV channels in the country. It is widely
respected for producing the best dramatic, public-affairs and
children's programming on PBS, and the station has long been
critical to building PBS viewership nationwide. From January
through May of this year, seven of PBS's top-10 rated programs were
produced by WGBH, including ``NOVA,'' ``Mystery!'' and ``The
American Experience.''
</P>
<P>
   But WGBH is also among the best at marketing itself. After its
base grant was cut by the federal government _ and thanks in part
to the massive public outcry that followed Gingrich's death
sentence for PBS _ WGBH saw its donations increase by a half
million dollars in both 1995 and 1996. The increase in the years
before that was half as much, according to Jeanne M. Hopkins, WGBH
vice president for corporate communications.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say the current attacks against the station and
public broadcasting could backfire again. But for now, the station
is under additional pressure to raise money, thanks to a federal
mandate that all public TV stations transmit digitally by 2003.
Channel 2 alone will have to spend $7 million _ an expense Hopkins
admits has increased pressure on the station to raise money. WGBH,
which currently operates with a $160 million annual budget,
recently embarked on a $33 million capital campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Getting those funds from the federal government may be even more
difficult in the wake of the list-swapping ordeal. Tuesday the
House subcommittee that oversees funding for public broadcasting is
holding hearings about the list-swapping, and several Republicans
say they hope to determine whether the country needs a public
broadcasting system at all.

IN RUSSIA'S TUMULT, LOWLY YOUNG BOSSES OF SMALL OUTFITS GROW RICH 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Ernest Shakarov, a former investment banker, is among
the few Russians who could easily have kept living comfortably
after a crisis shattered the securities industry here.
</P>
<P>
   At 28, having worked for some of Moscow's better brokerage
firms, he could have left turbulent Russia or moved to another
prestigious job.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Shakarov chose the great, arduous unknown of
manufacturing in Russia, investing $70,000 of his savings in a
small venture to make mayonnaise for the highly competitive Moscow
market. ``There were pessimists who said, `Why are you doing this
when you could be getting a six-figure salary?' '' Shakarov said.
``I had several offers, but there comes a time when you want to
work for yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, with a company whose sales have been doubling every month,
Shakarov is part of a rising generation of manufacturers who found
opportunity amid the tumult. The ruble's devaluation made imports
too expensive for most people, and as imports shrank, Russian
manufacturers filled the void with cheaper products. Large,
Soviet-built factories have done best, but people like Shakarov are
also fashioning a role for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Typically in their 20s and 30s, these entrepreneurs left the
securities industry or the importing business to open factories
that make everything from bar snacks to women's blouses. No one
knows their exact number, and their operations are still small. But
they bring to Russian industry a knowledge of finance, marketing
and management that most old directors of Soviet-built plants have
still not mastered.
</P>
<P>
   Most important perhaps, the new blood proves the resilience of
entrepreneurs here. Despite the huge blows that Russia's chronic
instability has dealt them, they consistently find ways to adapt.
``This is the future,'' Shakarov said. ``Russia will be a normal
country, a normal market, when professionals with experience in a
market economy go into manufacturing.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Russia is far from what anyone would consider normal.
The government does little to support entrepreneurs, burdening them
with corrupt bureaucrats, endless red tape and suffocating taxes.
Even the lack of reliable statistics about small business
illustrates its lowly status.
</P>
<P>
   Small business makes up only 10 percent of Russia's economy,
while in most Western countries it is about half.
</P>
<P>
   The economic collapse did not reduce the number of small
businesses sharply, but it did change their mix, indicating that as
some businesses closed, new ones in different, more profitable
fields opened. The official number of small businesses in the first
half of 1999 fell by only 1,000 from a year earlier, to about
870,000. But there are many more: to avoid Russia's onerous taxes,
a lot of enterprises simply do not register.
</P>
<P>
   More businesses were involved in services, manufacturing, retail
and restaurants in January than a year ago, according to the
Russian agency for developing small and midsize businesses.
Although the agency lacks information about the nature of new
manufacturing, discussions with analysts and entrepreneurs indicate
that it is mainly in food processing and clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some money survived the crisis, and money should make more
money,'' says Vladimir Buyev, head of a commission on
entrepreneurship of the liberal Yabloko Party. ``Those people
decided to get into manufacturing in Russia. After all, even during
a crisis, people have to eat and wear clothes, and that niche is
still largely open.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Much of the money that survived was in the hands of people
working in finance, who earned handsomely in the bull markets of
the mid-1990s, and those in importing, who had a few thousand
dollars on hand as working capital. Entrepreneurs seldom turn to
Russian banks because they charge exorbitant interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The average initial investment for manufacturing projects
appears to be $40,000 to $70,000, still a large sum in Russia. Some
companies set up their own production lines, while others turned to
existing factories. New manufacturers understand that working in
securities or with imports made them vulnerable to broad,
uncontrollable factors like political and economic stability. But
real production for the domestic market shields them more from the
vicissitudes of President Boris N. Yeltsin's health or the
fluctuations of world markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I still worked on the securities market, I'd care much more
about who would be Russia's next president,'' said Grigory
Khutsiyev, a 32-year-old former equities trader who now runs a
women's clothing factory. ``Political risks play much more of a
role there.''

 &HT;    Football coaches favor expansion, but ACC unsure
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. _ Every year, the ACC must deal with an
uncomfortable reality: Despite its football success in the '90s _
only the SEC has a better record against non-conference competition
_ the league, aside from Florida State, is still not getting the
respect other conferences get when it comes to major bowl bids.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens,'' Georgia Tech coach George O'Leary said. ``And
it's something we have to face.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how the ACC will address this problem has touched off an
internal debate about what kind the conference it wants to be in
the next century.
</P>
<P>
   Media reports have the ACC considering the addition of Miami of
the Big East as a 10th member. Others have suggested that the ACC
go to 12 teams in order to create a conference championship game.
Still others want no change at all, fearing that it would affect
the ACC's status as one of the nation's best basketball
conferences.
</P>
<P>
   ACC commissioner John Swofford held his annual ``State of the
Conference'' session with the media Sunday night where he fielded
an hour's worth of questions about expansion. Bottom line: No
commitments have been made and, for now, the ACC is standing pat.
But the discussion continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we talk about it (expansion) at every meeting but
we are not anywhere near any formal stages on the question,''
Swofford said. ``And we may not ever be.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's true, the ACC could see a replay of 1997, when North
Carolina had a 10-1 record, a No. 5 national ranking and the best
defense in the country. But come the postseason, the best the ACC
runner-up could do was the Gator Bowl. The snub proved to be the
last straw for coach Mack Brown, who soon left Chapel Hill for
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   It could have happened again last season. Georgia Tech was ACC
co-champion with Florida State and would have been 10-1 if not for
a season-opening loss to Boston College. Still, the Yellow Jackets
would have likely been passed over for a Bowl Championships Series
bid in favor of Ohio State (10-1) of the Big Ten and Florida (9-2)
of the SEC, which got bids to the Sugar and Orange, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Football coaches don't get into the politics of an issue like
expansion. But they can relate to a 10-1 team going to a lesser
bowl simply because of the power rating of the conference. That's
why several ACC football coaches said Monday that the league should
strongly consider expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need to expand to 12 teams and we need to get on
with it,'' said O'Leary. ``It increases the exposure of the
conference, creates new rivalries, and improves the overall power
rating of the conference.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need some new blood in the league,'' said Virginia
coach George Welsh. ``I think people get tired of the same old
rivalries. It will bring more money to the conference and we're all
strapped for cash now. I can't see a reason not to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The basketball forces would beg to differ. With 12 teams, the
practice of playing everybody in the league twice each season would
end, as it did when the SEC expanded. That, said some TV executives
who attended these meetings, would decrease the overall value of
the lucrative basketball package. Then there is the matter of
further dividing tickets to the ACC Basketball Tournament, which
have always been the primary fund-raising tool for the schools.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the football coaches aren't sympathetic to
basketball, but they do point out that for the first time last
year, the ACC earned more TV money from football than basketball.
They believe that trend will continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand (basketball's) concerns,'' said O'Leary. ``But
you need to pay attention to the horse that drives the cart, and
that's football.''
</P>
<P>
   The ACC has expanded only twice since it was founded in 1953,
first to add Georgia Tech in 1979 and then to add Florida State in
1991. To expand, seven of the nine ACC members must approve.

   Taft throws support behind Bush
</P>
<P>
   By William Hershey and Mike Wagner
</P>
<P>
   C. 1999 COX NEWS SERVICE
</P>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Gov. Bob Taft jumped off the fence Monday and
onto the George W. Bush bandwagon, endorsing the Texas governor for
the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Most other major Ohio Republican officeholders also endorsed
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Bush has the energy, intelligence, vision and commitment
to lead our country and restore honesty and integrity to the White
House,'' Taft said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   Taft will be Bush's Ohio campaign chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement came just days before Bush's first scheduled
campaign visit to Ohio on Thursday. He is to visit the Coalition
for Drug-Free Greater Cincinnati in the afternoon and attend a
$1,000-a-person fundraiser that evening at the Omni Netherlands
Hotel, said Mindy Tucker, Bush's campaign press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker said that the Texas governor, who came to Ohio to host a
fundraiser on Taft's behalf during the 1998 gubernatorial campaign,
was ``honored'' to have Taft's endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many other Ohio Republicans, Taft never endorsed U.S.
Rep. John Kasich, R-Westerville, for the presidential nomination
and was neutral until Monday. Taft's endorsement of Bush followed
Kasich's decision last week to shut down his exploratory committee
and back Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Milburn, Taft's spokesman, said Taft had been watching the
campaign for the Republican nomination unfold and had seen Bush
demonstrate his effectiveness as a campaigner and fundraiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time was right,'' Milburn said.
</P>
<P>
   The other Republicans who joined Taft in endorsing Bush will be
co-chairmen of Bush's Ohio campaign. They include:
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Betty Montgomery; Auditor Jim Petro; Treasurer
Joseph T. Deters; Lt. Gov. Maureen O'Connor; House Speaker Jo Ann
Davidson, R-Reynoldsburg and Senate President Richard Finan,
R-Cincinnati, whose state Senate district includes Warren County.
</P>
<P>
   Nine of the 11 Ohio Republicans in the U.S. House, including
David Hobson of Springfield and John Boehner of West Chester, also
endorsed Bush and will be co-chairmen. Hobson's district includes
Clark and Greene counties while Boehner's district includes Preble,
Darke and Miami counties and part of Montgomery County
</P>
<P>
   Ohio's two Republican U.S. Senators, George Voinovich and Mike
DeWine, both backed Kasich but so far have not picked another
candidate, their aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio Secretary of State J. Kenneth Blackwell, a Republican who
is national chairman of publisher Steve Forbes' presidential
campaign, said the Bush backers include the same sort of
establishment Republicans who backed a failed statewide ballot
issue to raise the state sales tax in 1998. Forbes joined Blackwell
in opposing the sales tax increase, Blackwell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time we let the people decide instead of the
Republican establishment,'' said Blackwell. ``The people spoke. I
anticipate that will be the same in 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Hobson said a ``bittersweet feeling'' lingered among some who
backed Kasich. He said, however, that ``Republicans in the country
want to win'' and that backing Bush seems the best way to
accomplish that.
</P>
<P>
   While the endorsements don't necessarily translate into
rank-and-file support for Bush, they will unite nearly all the
state's Republican political organizations behind a single
candidate more than a year before the general election, said state
Rep. Jeff Jacobson, R-Phillipsburg and chairman of the Montgomery
County Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Lieberman, the Montgomery County Democratic chairman and
a backer of Vice President Al Gore for president, said there's a
long time to go before the election.
</P>
<P>
   Praising Gore, Lieberman predicted, ``Today's polls are not
going to be tomorrow's results.'' .

DONOR LIST SQUABBLE HIGHLIGHTS PBS FUNDRAISING DILEMMA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT AND DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Boston's WGBH-TV last week admitted swapping
donor lists with the Democratic Party, the controversy that erupted
seemed driven entirely by Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, long suspicious of a liberal bias in public
broadcasting, threatened to slash funding. Democrats leaped to the
defense, insisting the practice was legal, accusing Republicans of
using any excuse to cut off public broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   But as the dust has begun to settle, and as both parties have
been implicated in list-swapping to some degree, it has become
clear the ordeal is not just about Washington politics. It is a
window into the identity crisis of public broadcasting: How to be a
public station and a successful commercial venture at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Public Broadcasting Service came under attack in
1995 _ with Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich promising to
``zero out'' its federal money _ public broadcasters have been
encouraged to finance themselves, with the most successful stations
learning how to draw in ever more vast amounts of public donations
and corporate support. In that context, industry analysts said, it
should be no surprise that WGBH may have pushed the envelope too
far.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this is about is how far the commercial mindset has crept
into public television,'' said William Hoynes, a Vassar College
professor of sociology and author of a book on public television.
``This is part of a bigger picture. WGBH treated its customers as a
market. They packaged them and sold them in an effort to generate
new revenues.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Chester, an analyst at the Center for Media Education,
agreed: ``Over the years, public broadcasting has become more risk
averse, less public, more commercial. It has been forced to become
privatized, in a way.''
</P>
<P>
   Public broadcasting's growing commercialization has manifested
itself in a variety of ways, from the intensive merchandising of
tie-in products related to children's programs, to catering to
corporate interests with a proliferation of business shows, to the
airing of underwriter spots that differ little, if at all, from
regular commercials.
</P>
<P>
   There are the all-too-familiar examples: the Juicy Fruit
underwriting spot on WGBH, for one, that looks to many outside
analysts like a juice commercial aimed at children watching
``Arthur,'' the show the company sponsors. Then there are the
website links. With a click on a single icon on the WGBH website,
viewers can be connected instantly to the website of Digital
computers _ a virtual supermarket of computer terminals and
software sold by the WGBH sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   ``That word `underwriting' is just an obfuscatory PBS word,''
said Gary Ruskin, head of Commercial Alert, a Washington-based
consumer watchdog group founded by Ralph Nader. ``They're trying to
deny what is transparently obvious: PBS advertises. Orwell would be
proud of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the trend call it ``creeping commercialism.''
Critics say the drive for funds has distorted public broadcasting's
priorities, fundamentally altering its mission to produce
non-commercial work.
</P>
<P>
   But by not relying on commercial funds, PBS was forced to rely
on the federal government _ a sponsor, it turned out, as fickle as
any commercial underwriter who wants control over the product.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, after the GOP took control of Congress, Gingrich and
Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Larry Pressler of South Dakota
pledged to close down the public broadcasting system, a network
they accused of being both liberal and a drain on the federal
budget.
</P>
<P>
   The political attack sent shockwaves throughout PBS.
Broadcasters already strapped for funding began thinking up
creative ways to fund programs. Even today Robert Coonrod, the
president of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting _ the umbrella
organization for public television and radio _ and other public
broadcasters argue they need to partially fund themselves rather
than depend on the whims of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   And to some, including Alan D. Solomont, a member of the WGBH
board and a former finance chairman for the Democratic National
Committee, that is not entirely bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the way philanthropy has changed. People now do their
philanthropy with a much more strategic sense,'' Solomont said.
``Public broadcasting, as its needs have grown, has tried to
maintain itself and is working very hard to raise more and more
money.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the opponents of creeping commercialism, Solomont said:
``I think they could loosen up a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   But to others, creative fund-raising in public broadcasting is
one step down a slippery slope toward pandering to corporate
interests and led to the current debacle over swapping lists with
the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Republicans began training their fire on PBS, an
obsession with funding had begun to color program choices on PBS.
For instance, Hoynes, the Vassar professor, said when he
interviewed documentary producers at WGBH in the early 1990s as
part of research for his book, he found some producers were
weighing the ``fundability'' factor before deciding which projects
to undertake.
</P>
<P>
   ``The producers described a growing conflict between a
programming-driven system and a funding-driven system,'' Hoynes
said.
</P>
<P>
   To try to reverse that trend, Representative Edward J. Markey,
the Democrat from Massachusetts, plans to introduce a bill that
would tighten restrictions so credits announcing the sponsor of a
program would not resemble advertisements. The current flap over
list-swapping, Markey said, is the result of budget cuts, not
liberal bias.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be ironic if all the Republicans who seek to cure the
problems of list-swapping _ the method PBS used to generate more
revenues _ then decide to cut the PBS budget further,'' Markey
said. ``Obviously that would drive PBS to even more desperate
means.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvin F. Poussaint, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical
School, coauthored a scathing critique of PBS's marketing of
``Teletubbies'' in the May/June issue of The American Prospect
magazine, but Poussaint said GOP-led budget cutbacks put the system
in its current quandary. ``If PBS is trading off lists with donors,
they're doing it under pressure; they need to survive,'' Poussaint
said. ``The culprit in this situation may be more the government
and Congress in cutting off their money and forcing them to become
commercial.''
</P>
<P>
   At the center of both the list-swapping controversy and the
trend toward commercialism is WGBH, the Boston station that is one
of two flagship public TV channels in the country. It is widely
respected for producing the best dramatic, public-affairs and
children's programming on PBS, and the station has long been
critical to building PBS viewership nationwide. From January
through May of this year, seven of PBS's top-10 rated programs were
produced by WGBH, including ``NOVA,'' ``Mystery!'' and ``The
American Experience.''
</P>
<P>
   But WGBH is also among the best at marketing itself. After its
base grant was cut by the federal government _ and thanks in part
to the massive public outcry that followed Gingrich's death
sentence for PBS _ WGBH saw its donations increase by a half
million dollars in both 1995 and 1996. The increase in the years
before that was half as much, according to Jeanne M. Hopkins, WGBH
vice president for corporate communications.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say the current attacks against the station and
public broadcasting could backfire again. But for now, the station
is under additional pressure to raise money, thanks to a federal
mandate that all public TV stations transmit digitally by 2003.
Channel 2 alone will have to spend $7 million _ an expense Hopkins
admits has increased pressure on the station to raise money. WGBH,
which currently operates with a $160 million annual budget,
recently embarked on a $33 million capital campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Getting those funds from the federal government may be even more
difficult in the wake of the list-swapping ordeal. Tuesday the
House subcommittee that oversees funding for public broadcasting is
holding hearings about the list-swapping, and several Republicans
say they hope to determine whether the country needs a public
broadcasting system at all.

 &HT;    State regulators question whether auto insurers are overcharging
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo, Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ For the second year in a row, state regulators
aggressively are questioning whether some auto insurance companies
are charging their policyholders too much, officials with the Texas
Department of Insurance said.
</P>
<P>
   But while the department moves through the complex process of
reviewing the rates, consumer advocates complain that insurance
companies could be overcharging customers and will face no penalty
for it.
</P>
<P>
   The department reviews annual insurance rates to determine
whether they are justified and sufficient to keep a company in
business. In agreements negotiated with the department last year,
more than a dozen auto insurers lowered their rates, many of which
already had been lowered from the previous year. The department
argued that those lowered rates still were too high when compared
to the number and cost of claims.
</P>
<P>
   Department spokesman Lee Jones said similarly negotiated rates
could be announced this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working with the companies to get their rates more in
line with where they ought to be,'' he said, adding that the
department will not reveal the companies whose rates are being
questioned until there's been time to determine whether the rates
need to be lowered.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers and industry officials say companies file rates that
they believe are justified and sufficient to cover claims. They
said the department's scrutiny of some rates comes because of
different opinions over how to evaluate previous claims and other
factors used to set rates.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates, however, say that companies actually have an
incentive to file rates that are too high. They said the companies
can apply those rates for several months to new and renewed
policies and then agree to lower the rates after the department
questions them without being forced to refund customers for any
overcharges.
</P>
<P>
   The advocates, including Rob Schneider of Consumers Union, say
insurance buyers should get refunds when companies file rates that
later are lowered because of regulators' challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies now may be toying with the department and with Texas
policyholders by submitting filings that are too high _ that they
know ought to be disapproved _ and using the delay . . . in order
to squeeze out a little more money from policyholders. I'm sure
we're talking about millions of dollars,'' Schneider said. ``The
department needs to put disincentives in place. Penalties and
requirements for restitution are the way to make sure the companies
don't do these kind of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurers called that idea unfair because rate increases aren't
retroactive and generally don't take immediate effect. They also
said there's no incentive to file rates that are too high, mainly
because there's too much competition in the auto insurance market.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said department officials have no evidence that insurers
are abusing the system. He also said penalties and refunds are an
option during negotiations, but could stall agreements on lower
rates if they were required in every case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Negotiations involve give and take on both sides,'' Jones
said. ``As insurance regulators, we've got to use both the carrot
and the stick, and if we insist on making reductions retroactive,
then we've taken a big carrot off of the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones added that if rates lowered via negotiations always were
retroactive or came with penalties and refunds, they more likely
would be challenged and delayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Negotiating gets rate reductions to the consumer much faster
and without long and expensive hearings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Cooper, a spokeswoman for Allstate Insurance, said rates
aren't just thrown together and require more consideration than
profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to file your rates based on the numbers,'' Cooper
said.
</P>
<P>
   Allstate lowered the overall auto insurance rates offered by its
three companies by an average of 0.8 percent, including a 5.1
percent cut for Allstate Insurance Co. and a 1.1 percent cut for
Allstate Indemnity. Allstate Property and Casualty raised its rates
by 2.9 percent. Cooper could not say whether the insurance
department is questioning the changes.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper said the costs of setting rates that are too high,
including the loss of business, are enormous. She said Allstate,
one of Texas' largest auto insurance companies, doesn't play such
games with rates or customers.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Johns, president of the Southwestern Insurance Information
Service, a group that represents large insurance companies, said he
doesn't believe any companies have that mind set.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because the department in its judgement finds that the
rate is too high does not mean that the rate is too high. That is
one regulatory agency's perspective,'' Johns said.

HP'S CHOICE OF FIORINA A TOP STEP FOR WOMEN EXECUTIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Fortune Magazine named Carleton (Carly) Fiorina the most
powerful woman in American business last year, she was president of
a core division at Lucent Technologies, a position to reckon with.
</P>
<P>
   But with her appointment Monday as president and chief executive
of Hewlett-Packard, the world's second largest computer maker,
Fiorina is truly at the top.
</P>
<P>
   The first chief executive officer to be selected from outside
Hewlett-Packard's ranks, Fiorina is credited with executing the
highly successful spinoff of Lucent from AT&AMP;T three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Monday's appointment that made the 44-year-old
executive the highest-ranking woman at a publicly held company, and
one of only three to preside over a Fortune 500 company. The other
women are Jill Barad, CEO of Mattel, and Marion Sandler, chief
executive of Golden West Financial in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Fiorina, who received a masters of science degree from the Sloan
School of Management at MIT in 1989, held an entry-level job in
Hewlett-Packard's shipping department in the 1970's while studying
medieval history and philosophy at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   Her professional background includes such diverse work
experiences as teaching English in Italy, selling telephone service
to federal agencies and, during a stellar rise up the executive
ranks of AT&AMP;T, turning Lucent into one of the largest
telecommunications equipment manufacturer's in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Fiorina's appointment, effective July 17, ended a closely
watched search that began more than two months ago when CEO Lewis
Platt, 58, asked the executive search firm, Christian &AMP; Timbers, to
find Hewlett-Packard's next president and chief executive, analysts
said. Platt is expected to retire in December, but will remain
chairman until then.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made a brilliant choice,'' said Platt. ``We have a
leader who can truly take us into the next millenium and do it
successfully.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiorina noted during a conference call with reporters that the
search for a new president and CEO included both men and women. ``I
hope we are now at the point that the accomplishments of women
demonstrate that there (should be) no glass ceiling,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, analysts and women's groups hailed Fiorina's
appointment as a significant step for women in the highly
competitive information technology field. In choosing Fiorina, they
said, Hewlett-Packard sought a fresh approach in an effort to spur
sales growth and help the sluggish computer giant compete more
effectively. The company, which has $47 billion in annual sales
revenue, also turned to a woman with a significant record of
achievement in an industry long dominated by men.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this was a situation where a woman was being appointed to
head a consumer product company, I would say, well, that is not
that unusual,'' said Scott A. Scanlon, chairman and CEO of
Hunt-Scanlon Advisors, search industry analysts in Greenwich, Ct.
``The information technology sector is one of the remaining male
bastions, which is why this search and this appointment are so
significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Scanlon, ``HP was clearly looking for someone who was out
of the box. In fact, this search was an invitation to the rest of
the technology community to break down traditional barriers and
offer more top spots to women.''
</P>
<P>
   Jo Weiss, vice president of advisory services at Catalyst, a New
York think tank that studies women's progress in the workplace,
said the research group ``applauds the appointment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This sends a strong message to women and girls that they can
be business leaders,'' Weiss said. `` She has a 20-year business
record that reflects AT&AMP;T's and Lucent's openness and willingness
to appoint and hire women.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Weiss noted that technology firms have not
kept pace with other companies in hiring, nurturing and appointing
women executives to top jobs. In 1998, for example, 7 percent of
the corporate officers at Fortune 500 technology companies were
women. By contrast, 11.2 percent of all Fortune 500 firms reported
having women officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pipeline is filled with talented women and minorities who
are ready for similar responsibilities,'' said Weiss. ``But senior
women still face stereotypes and preconceptions concerning their
abilities and commitment to the job, and they are still being
excluded from informal networks that are available to men.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Cooper, publisher of Executive Recruiting News, which
tracks recruiting industry, noted that Ann Livermore, the
40-year-old chief excecutive of HP's enterprise computer group, was
also a contender for the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision to bring in a woman was in keeping with
Hewlett-Packard's progressive human resource strategy,'' said
Cooper, who tracked the search. ``At Lucent, Fiorina essentially
turbo-charged a spinoff that was essentially another large company.
She was brought in because Hewlett-Packard has been accused of
being slow to develop a clear Internet strategy. Hewlett-Packard
(officials) are looking to Fiorina to jump-start the company the
same way she jump-started Lucent.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Fortune magazine named Fiorina the most powerful
woman in corporate America, noting that when she finally joined
AT&AMP;T as a sales representative in 1980 ``she refused to join the
savings plan because, she said, no way would she stay past two
years.'' Fiorina was 25, and still unsure of her career goals.
</P>
<P>
   After setting up joint ventures for the company's equipment
division, Network Systems, in Asia, Fiorina's career advanced
quickly. By 35, she had become the first woman to serve as an
officer at Network Systems. By 40, she was running the company's
sales in North America.
</P>
<P>
   At AT&AMP;T, Fiorina served as president of corporate relations
during Lucent's 1996 spinoff, a $3-billion deal that was the
biggest IPO in the country at the time.
</P>
<P>
   As president of the spinoff's Global Service Provider Business,
Fiorina is credited with running operations that provided network
equipment to big telecommunications firms and Internet service
providers. At the time, Fiorina was in control of $21 billion in
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Fiorina said Monday that her success was fueled by a
``combination of people being willing to take a chance early in my
career, the willingness to take risks and accept the fact that
failure is also possible.''
</P>
<P>
   As for her appointment as Hewlett Packard's chief executive, she
said, ``I hope that what people see is what happens when folks
focus on the possibilities and not the limitations. There are now
so many examples of outstanding women and minorities in business
that we should focus on that and go beyond this single event.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ When he was sworn in last month as a member of
Israel's Parliament, Ahmad Tibi, an Israeli Arab, rose for the
national anthem as the newly elected legislature was inaugurated.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers sang. But Tibi stood in silence, caught in the
contradiction between his twin identities as an Israeli and an
Arab.
</P>
<P>
   Tibi, a former adviser to Yasser Arafat, defines himself as a
Palestinian with Israeli citizenship, and his first moments in
Parliament captured the paradox of his life in two worlds. After
years in the public eye as an interpreter of Palestinian views to
Israelis, Tibi is now an Israeli legislator, embodying the complex
loyalties of the 1 million Arab citizens in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   A television camera lingered for a moment on his face as the
anthem was sung, but his lips were still.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tune is nice, but the lyrics don't speak to me,'' Tibi
said of the anthem, ``Hatikva,'' which describes the longing of
Jews for Zion, a biblical name for Jerusalem. ``I am not a Jew and
I am not a Zionist. So I couldn't express my identification.''
</P>
<P>
   But he did join with other lawmakers in pledging ``allegiance to
the state of Israel,'' a vow that he allowed was a novelty for him
after six years of working with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can live with it,'' said Tibi, one of 12 Arabs in the
Parliament. ``I didn't pledge allegiance to the Zionism of the
state, but to the state of Israel that I would like to be mine, as
a citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   Tibi, 40, became a household word when he was Arafat's adviser,
speaking to Israelis in flawless Hebrew in radio and television
interviews. He resigned his post when he became a candidate for
Parliament. Speaking in his cramped quarters in Parliament, one of
several cubicles reserved for new legislators, Tibi set out his
philosophy with the practiced skill of a man used to straddling
fences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have dual loyalty, and my identity is well defined,''
he said. ``I am a Palestinian Arab citizen of the state of Israel.
I am both Palestinian and Israeli.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm part of a deprived national minority that is not
recognized in Israel and has no influence on the decision-making
process,'' Tibi added, echoing a prevalent view among Israeli
Arabs, who in many respects are treated like second-class citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Although one of every six Israelis is an Arab, there are no Arab
cabinet ministers in the new government of Prime Minister Ehud
Barak, only 5 percent of the employees in the Civil Service are
Arab, and many Israeli Arabs live in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be a partner with the Jewish majority in all civic
functions, which can ultimately lead to civic equality,'' Tibi
said. ``I want integration, but not assimilation.''
</P>
<P>
   That means steps like appointing Arabs to the boards of large
state companies, he said, affirmative action for Arab university
graduates by employing them in the Civil Service and admission to
the Parliament's Foreign Affairs and Security Committee, where no
Arab has been allowed to serve.
</P>
<P>
   Tibi caused a stir when he said he wanted to be on the panel,
whose discussions are confidential but routinely leaked to the
press. Rightist members of Parliament objected, citing Tibi's past
as an adviser to Arafat and suggesting that his loyalty was
suspect.
</P>
<P>
   He asserted that he serves only his constituents, not Arafat.
The head of the Shin Bet security service, Ami Ayalon, said he had
no objections to the appointment, because Tibi is a duly elected
official.
</P>
<P>
   The debate produced results. Hashem Mahameed, a legislator from
the largest Arab faction in Parliament, the United Arab List, was
named to the committee last week over the protests of the Likud
party.
</P>
<P>
   Tibi said there was ``nothing in Israeli society that I will
want to avoid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm interested in the environmental quality in Ashkelon, and
school violence in Tel Aviv is important to me,'' he said. ``I'll
speak in Beersheba and meet with people in Raanana,'' a well-off
Tel Aviv suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Tibi's determination to be accepted on equal terms gained public
attention 12 years ago, when he was dismissed from Hadassah
Hospital here after an altercation with a hospital guard who used a
racial slur against him. An intern at the time, Tibi, a
gynecologist, was stopped for a search at the hospital entrance as
he arrived with other doctors, who were Jewish. ``The guard said,
`Every Arab is a terrorist and must be checked,' '' Tibi recalled.
``He spit on the ground and pushed me while we quarreled, and I
threw my briefcase at him. I was fired for assaulting the guard.''
</P>
<P>
   Tibi said he had heard echoes of that attitude in the way that
Barak treated Arab parties in the talks that led to the formation
of his government. Barak made no effort to draw them into his
coalition of Jewish parties drawn from both the left and the right.
When he presented his cabinet in Parliament, he was heckled by Arab
lawmakers, who complained that he had left them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ehud Barak showed ungratefulness to the Arab population, which
worked to bring him to power,'' Tibi said, noting the overwhelming
support that Arab voters gave Barak. ``If he thinks he can throw us
away after we've done the dirty work, then we can show him a thing
or two. Politics is dynamic. There will be crises along the way.
There are always developments in Parliament, and he will need the
votes of the Arabs.''

</P>
<P>
   The late John F. Kennedy, Jr. did not approve of the Monica
Lewinsky affair, and berated President Bill Clinton in the pages of
his glossy political magazine, George. He did not have much
sympathy, either, for his cousins Joe and Michael, whom he
described as ``poster boys for bad behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   It is safe to assume that John Kennedy, Jr. did not admire
patriarch Joseph Kennedy's modus operandi, which has guided the
rest of his family, either: ``It doesn't matter what you are. It
only matters what people think you are.''
</P>
<P>
   So the fact that his sudden, early death has placed him back at
the center of the Kennedy myth, which his ruthless grandfather
created, is a cause for sadness in itself.
</P>
<P>
   John Kennedy, Jr. had set himself against that myth, but now he
has been swallowed up by it. It doesn't matter what he was anymore;
it only matters what people thought he could have been... &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ As with the untimely death of the Princess of Wales
almost two years ago for Britain, the death of 38-year-old JFK, Jr.
and his 33-year-old wife caught a moment when currents of
generations and social and political trends all came together as
neither before nor since.
</P>
<P>
   For Britain, the public outpouring of grief marked the passing
of a certain idea of the Royal Family; it sealed the decline of the
stiff upper lip as the defining feature of Englishness.
</P>
<P>
   There is a similarly unique crisscrossing of strands in the
United States now. Those in the prime of their power and influence,
driving the Kennedy nostalgia, are the JFK generation.
</P>
<P>
   As with the mourning for the Princess of Wales, the moment when
all the propitious currents converge is short and unlikely to be
repeated.
</P>
<P>
   Already, in the views of the 10 percent or so of Americans who
look askance at the shock and grief attending JFK Jr.'s death can
be divined the end of the Kennedy mystique... &QL;

<P>
   MARTHA'S VINEYARD _ John F. Kennedy, Jr. was not royalty, but he
was surely a prince. The only surviving son of an assassinated
president, he was also America's favorite son: impossibly good
looking, very rich and a perennial of gossip headlines and magazine
covers.
</P>
<P>
   Even his death _ apparent death _ was more poignant and more
strange than the most fertile of tabloid imaginations could have
mustered.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Fallen Son,'' said the front page of the Cape Cod Times. In
New York there were 25 pages of JFK, Jr. in the Post, 24 pages in
the Daily News. Only Princess Diana could beat him on the
newsstand.
</P>
<P>
   Now in death, his story resonates with the family tragedies that
came before _ in its sadness and the shock it delivers to America. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the news first broke Saturday morning that
John F. Kennedy, Jr.'s small plane was missing off the coast of
Long Island, a shudder went through the East Coast political and
media establishment. Could it really be that the ``curse'' had
struck again, felling another young and promising Kennedy in his
prime?
</P>
<P>
   His father, President John F. Kennedy, had met his premature
death at the hands of an assassin in Dallas in 1963. His uncle,
Robert, who aspired to follow in his brother's footsteps, was
assassinated five years later.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the death of JFK Jr. is not just another family member
lost to the ``curse.'' It is the end, in a way, of the JFK legend.
This is how Camelot has ended: in the black waters of the Atlantic,
at night. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ It was a rough first day as a Democrat for Rep.
Michael Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the day, no one in the congressman's offices here or
on Long Island answered the phones, opened the mail or helped
constituents with their complaints. ``The office is closed,'' a
Capitol Police officer said Monday afternoon, peeking out from
behind a locked door of Forbes' office in the Cannon House Office
Building.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all of Forbes' aides have abandoned him, resigning en
masse on Monday in protest of their boss' decision on Saturday to
quit the Republican Party and become a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen members of Forbes' staff entered his Capitol Hill
office about 10 a.m. to hand in their keys, identification badges
and letters of resignation, many of which bitterly denounced the
often mercurial lawmaker. Six aides in Forbes' Long Island office
in Shirley, N.Y., also quit, Republican aides said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sudden and radical departure from all you supposedly held
dear is inexplicable and unexplainable,'' Brian Fauls, Forbes'
former legislative director and an aide to the congressman since he
first joined the House in 1995, wrote in his letter of resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Another aide, Todd Tolson, wrote to Forbes, ``The staff of the
First Congressional District of New York should have been the first
to know of your cowardly move.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Congressional Committee alerted
reporters to the mass walkout on Monday morning. By midmorning an
impromptu news conference spilled out of Forbes' suddenly very
unstaffed office, without the congressman. He did not fly back to
Washington from New York until late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats immediately criticized the tactic as a publicity ploy
aimed at embarrassing Forbes, a 47-year-old third-term lawmaker who
has been a pariah in Republican circles since he voted against Newt
Gingrich when Gingrich was running for re-election as House speaker
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   By late Monday afternoon, staff aides and summer interns from
the offices of several Democrats, including Rep. Richard Gephardt
of Missouri, the Democratic leader, and Rep. Eliot Engel of the
Bronx and Rep. Gary Ackerman of Queens, were dispatched to answer
the phones in Forbes' offices. They vowed to pick up the slack
until he could hire new staff members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sad for the departure of some very talented people who
worked for me,'' said Forbes, who offered the former aides a
month's severance pay. ``But we are open for business and serving
the people of New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes notified his staff by conference call late Friday night,
after meeting with Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Forbes' bad-boy status within the party, Speaker J.
Dennis Hastert and Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip,
sponsored a $1,000-a-plate fund-raising dinner for him in
Washington last month. Forbes has endorsed Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas for president.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans scoffed at accusations that they orchestrated the
walkout, but the party's congressional committee cheerily confirmed
it took advantage of the situation and sent a video cameraman to
record the event. The committee also let Forbes' former aides use
its offices and phones to speak to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The staffers were talking among themselves all weekend and
made their own decision,'' said Jill Schroeder, a spokeswoman for
the Republican campaign committee. ``All we really did was call the
reporters.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Democratic leaders were considering how to allow
Forbes to keep his position on the powerful House Appropriations
Committee without having to unseat a committee Democrat. Aides were
weighing the possibility of having senior members take rotating
leaves from the committee to allow Forbes to keep his plum
position.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats, and possibly President Clinton and Hillary
Rodham Clinton, had planned to hold a party meeting this week to
formally welcome Forbes into the fold. But those plans have been
postponed at least a week in light of the disappearance of a small
plane piloted by John F. Kennedy Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were gleeful over Forbes' defection. He became the
first congressional Republican to switch to the Democratic Party in
nearly a quarter-century. Before the defection, Republicans
controlled 223 House seats and the Democrats had 210. With Forbes'
switch, the Democrats now need to win just five additional seats to
be in the majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's become one of my best friend in Congress,'' said Engel.
``Now that he's a Democrat, he'll be even friendlier.''

 &HT;    Armstrong: The quiet hero
 &HT;    By Dale Huffman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ It was 30 years ago today that Neil Armstrong
took one small step that insured his place among the greatest
explorers in history.
</P>
<P>
   But ask those who have rubbed elbows with him in Lebanon, Ohio,
and you will see that he is unassuming about his achievement as the
first man to walk on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, 68, who lives life away from the public eye, is in
Florida at the Kennedy Space Center for anniversary celebrations of
his first step on the moon on this day in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   He raised his family in Lebanon in Warren County where he lived
for many years. He still owns a farm and maintains an office there
and visits on occasion. He makes his home now in a Cincinnati
suburb.
</P>
<P>
   In Lebanon, population 13,802, those who have come into contact
with Armstrong say he has never acted like a hot shot, and has
remained humble and quiet. They tend to protect his privacy and
describe him as just an average guy who will talk about virtually
anything except his place in space history.
</P>
<P>
   Stories dispatched from Florida in recent days have depicted
Armstrong as a somewhat stuffy reluctant hero, who on more than one
occasion has refused to sign autographs.
</P>
<P>
   That caught the attention of retired Dayton businessman Cy
Laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Laughter, who has a cadre of well-known celebrity acquaintances
in connection with his years of sponsoring the Bogie Busters golf
tournament in Dayton, says he knows another side of Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he played in the golf tournament he was always accessible
and open,'' Laughter said. ``He didn't talk much about his
accomplishments in space, but he was friendly and personable and
clearly the nice guy next door.''
</P>
<P>
   Laughter said he has pleasant memories of playing golf with
Armstrong and remembers once, near the 12th hole of a country club,
that Armstrong bent over and ripped his golfing shorts. ``He just
walked back to the gift shop and bought a new pair and came back
and finished the round,'' Laughter said. ``We still laugh about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Laughter has a photograph taken in 1987 that depicts Armstrong,
former President George Bush, astronaut Eugene Cernan, and Laughter
during the Bogie Busters golf tournament.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, it is autographed by Bush, Cernan and Armstrong, who
wrote: ``To Cy, All the Best, Neil.''
</P>
<P>
   ``President Bush told me he has offered a copy of this
photograph to be placed in his presidential museum in Texas,''
Laughter said. ``This just shows that Neil does sign autographs. He
is just selective about it, which is understandable.''

EUROPEAN PRESS WEIGHS IN ON KENNEDY 
</HEADLINE>
  (With KENNEDY-RDP) 
(mk) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ He was the custodian of a family's curse, a patrician
dynasty's tragic prince whose pride _ even arrogance _ led to his
downfall. He was a reckless adventurer, seized with a death wish
that played itself out in the hazy skies off Martha's Vineyard. For
Americans, he was the same royal orphan as Diana was for Britons.
</P>
<P>
   With front-page headlines and assessments like those, European
newspapers, from the tabloid Sun in Britain to the ponderous
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung in Germany, delivered their verdicts
Monday on the disappearance of John F. Kennedy Jr., part of the
frenzy of coverage that led the German paper to lament, ``The
global infotainment industry has its raw material _ the curse of
the Kennedys.''
</P>
<P>
   The photographs chronicled Kennedy's earliest years, from the
black-and-white pictures of a toddler in the Oval Office at the
feet of his father to the photo of the same child saluting the
passing coffin after the father's assassination in 1963. ``... And
he too was cursed,'' Germany's mass-circulation Bild Zeitung said
in a banner headline accompanying a photograph of the 3-year-old
``John-John'' at the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   But the words dwelt on two principal themes. In much of
Continental Europe, from Paris to Moscow, newspapers depicted
Kennedy's presumed death, along with those of his wife, Carolyn
Bessette Kennedy, and her sister Lauren Bessette, as the latest
manifestation of a family's tryst with an inescapably tragic
destiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rich, beautiful, but cursed,'' said Le Parisien in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The French paper Le Figaro labeled the Kennedys `'the accursed
kings,'' echoing the judgment of Russia's Sevodnya: ``The curse of
the Kennedy family.''
</P>
<P>
   In British newspapers, though, there was a different twist.
After the Sunday newspaper coverage spoke in detail of a cursed
clan, some of the tabloids on Monday painted another picture, of a
reckless young man dancing with death and throwing caution to the
same winds as held his single-engine Piper Saratoga.
</P>
<P>
   ``Insanity,'' The Mirror proclaimed in bold black type over a
headline that said, ``JFK Should Never Have Been Flying, Say
Experts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tragic John F. Kennedy,'' the paper's account began, ``was a
rookie pilot with just 46 hours' flying time, it was revealed last
night.'' (A former flight instructor of Kennedy has said that in
fact he accumulated more than 100 hours.)
</P>
<P>
   And The Daily Mail blared, ``Kennedy `Had a Death Wish.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those closest to him said he was so haunted by the murder of
his father, and by the series of tragedies which have preyed upon
his family, that he had developed a death wish in recent years,''
the newspaper reported in an article quoting remarks by Lauren
Lawrence, a ``dream analyst'' who has written for George magazine,
where Kennedy was president and editor in chief.
</P>
<P>
   In Rome, La Repubblica ventured that Kennedy had made the late
flight to Martha's Vineyard out of a tangle of emotions related to
his heritage as a Kennedy and a sense of inadequacy toward it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps he knew he wasn't up to'' donning the family mantle,
the paper said. ``But there could be no pity for one who bore his
father's name. He could not die in a bed old, ill, calm, surrounded
by pity and care. That would not have been like a Kennedy.''
</P>
<P>
   What draws newspaper readers in Europe to such accounts is the
same blend of power and tragedy, beauty and disaster as fascinates
many Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing like the woes of the powerful to make
hundreds of millions of anonymous people forget their misfortune,''
France-Soir said.
</P>
<P>
   `'The recipe for tragedy,'' it said, ``has not changed one iota
since ancient Greece.''
</P>
<P>
   Add in the elements of loss and redemption, though, and the
Kennedy story took on an element that seemed familiar to some
Europeans, who compared it to the death of Diana, Princess of
Wales, in a car accident in Paris two years ago. The left-wing
French daily Liberation detected what it called the ``Diana
treatment'' in American coverage of ``the most famous orphan of the
last half-century.''
</P>
<P>
   Some took issue with that comparison. Writing in the British
paper The Independent, Charles Wheeler, a journalist who has
covered the United States for many years, said: ``John Fitzgerald
Kennedy Jr. was not `America's crown prince, reaching for the
stars,' as one New York commentator called him. Nor is his
(presumed) death in an air crash `comparable to the death of
Diana.'''
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler suggested that it was no longer sensible to speak ``of a
`Kennedy dynasty' and of the Kennedy family as America's
`royals.''' The Kennedy myth, he said, ``died a slow death''
between 1969, the year of Sen. Edward Kennedy's car accident on
Chappaquiddick Island, Mass., and 1979, when he gave a memorably
unimpressive television interview that focused in part on his
presidential aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps,'' Wheeler said of the Kennedys, ``they should now be
left to get on with their lives.''

JUDGE WARNS NEW SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOL BOARD'S `BAD RECORD' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 PHILLIP O'CONNOR  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ U.S. District Judge Dean Whipple on Monday
warned Kansas City school Superintendent Benjamin Demps Jr. to be
wary of the school board members who were hiring him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry to tell you this school board has a bad record, a
bad history of meddling in administration, particularly in
personnel and contract matters,'' Whipple told Demps during a
two-hour court hearing. ``There are land mines you should be aware
of.''
</P>
<P>
   Demps on Monday signed a two-year contract with the district
that amounts to about $200,000 annually. It includes a base salary
of $156,420 a year, plus incentives and benefits. Demps will start
his new job Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Whipple told Demps, who sat in the front row of the courtroom,
that board members too often pursue politics, pet projects and
personal agendas to the detriment of schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   He mentioned instances of board members trying to get friends
and family hired or pushing favored programs with administrators.
</P>
<P>
   He also told of board members directing contracts to private
companies of close friends, associates and advisers. He mentioned
no board members by name.
</P>
<P>
   He told Demps that all district matters should continue to be
presented to the court-appointed Desegregation Monitoring Committee
in advance of the school board ``so pet projects can be killed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If a board member asks you to hire someone, rush a contract
through the board without presenting it to the DMC, these are flags
that vested interests are being pursued,'' Whipple said.
</P>
<P>
   At one point during the hearing, Whipple asked the five board
members still present whether they intended to ask Demps or his
staff to give preferential treatment to people or companies in
personnel, contractual and administrative matters.
</P>
<P>
   Board members Connie Clark, Sandy Mayer, Helen Ragsdale, John
Rios and Patricia Kurtz shook their heads no.
</P>
<P>
   Whipple then ordered the board to not take any actions that
would unduly influence Demps. Those who did would be in violation
of a court order.
</P>
<P>
   Demps did not speak during the hearing. Afterward, he said he
was grateful for the judge's comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did what he needed to do,'' Demps said. ``I'm very
appreciative of him laying it out. It makes it clear in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on the courthouse steps, Demps said he wanted
``patrons of the district to know that my interest is in educating
children.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he considered it outrageous that a nation with the power
and means of the United States had yet to solve the crisis of urban
education.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would move quickly to appoint a human resources
manager to help with staffing issues and a top educator to oversee
instruction in the district.
</P>
<P>
   ``My role is to come in and get the management house in order so
that education can proceed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also called on the community to take an active role in
efforts to improve the schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community must bring to the children the expectation of
education,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Board members were under orders from Whipple to reach agreement
with a superintendent finalist by Monday's hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The school board voted last week to offer the job to Demps, a
retired Federal Aviation Administration official who was director
of the Oklahoma Department of Human Services in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Several board members who spoke at Monday's hearing agreed with
Whipple's assessment of the district.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen patronage. I have seen preferential treatment,''
said Rios, the board president. ``I, like you, would like to see
that gone entirely. We don't need to micromanage. We want to have a
hands-off approach and let him run the district.''
</P>
<P>
   Ragsdale said she has children working for the district who
should be able to apply for positions for which they are qualified.
But she said she had no intention of pressing Demps to promote
them. Still, Ragsdale questioned whether it would ever be possible
to eradicate favoritism in hiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will always be patronage,'' Ragsdale said. ``We know
that as human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   Whipple told Ragsdale he disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   Whipple's comments about patronage angered board member Lance
Loewenstein, who did not attend the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unseemly for a federal judge to make such a broad-based
allegation,'' Loewenstein said. ``He needs to name names. If he
thinks this is the best way to do it _ to destroy people who've
never engaged in it _ I'm amazed.''
</P>
<P>
   Board member Fifi Wiedeman repeated her belief to Whipple that
the school board is incapable of leading the district and that a
new form of governance is needed.
</P>
<P>
   She asked Whipple to remove the board's ability to interfere
with Demps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I encourage you to not let us have much authority, but that we
not be blamed if it doesn't work out,'' Wiedeman said.
</P>
<P>
   Rios encouraged Whipple to order new board members to go for
training on how to do the job better. Rios also said he, as
president, should be the singular voice for the board. He
complained about other board members speaking to the media, saying
it reinforced the public image of a divided board.
</P>
<P>
   Kurtz said she wished Demps could have direct communication with
Whipple to provide clear direction and avoid misunderstandings.
Whipple said that communication should take place through the
monitoring committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still satisfied that those three (DMC) members don't have
personal or political agendas,'' Whipple said. ``When you need to
speak to me, speak to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Whipple briefly recessed the hearing after learning that the
parties had yet to reach final agreement on contract language
designed to give Demps greater autonomy in personnel decisions.
</P>
<P>
   School district general counsel Kathy Walter Mack assured
Whipple that the school board, the monitoring committee and Demps
were in agreement on the provision.
</P>
<P>
   But Whipple said he considered the provision among the most
critical in the contract because it would free Demps from board
interference in such matters. He said he wanted to see the final
language.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm uncomfortable with things agreed to in principle until we
get it nailed down,'' Whipple said.
</P>
<P>
   Demps, attorneys and others adjourned to a side room to insert
the needed language and complete the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   After signing the contract, Demps returned to Oklahoma City.
Rios is expected to sign the contract before tonight's regular
board meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a new day withDemps with us,'' Rios said. ``I'd like my
fellow board members to let him do the job.''

<P>
   The late John F. Kennedy, Jr. did not approve of the Monica
Lewinsky affair, and berated President Bill Clinton in the pages of
his glossy political magazine, George. He did not have much
sympathy, either, for his cousins Joe and Michael, whom he
described as ``poster boys for bad behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   It is safe to assume that John Kennedy, Jr. did not admire
patriarch Joseph Kennedy's modus operandi, which has guided the
rest of his family, either: ``It doesn't matter what you are. It
only matters what people think you are.''
</P>
<P>
   So the fact that his sudden, early death has placed him back at
the center of the Kennedy myth, which his ruthless grandfather
created, is a cause for sadness in itself.
</P>
<P>
   John Kennedy, Jr. had set himself against that myth, but now he
has been swallowed up by it. It doesn't matter what he was anymore;
it only matters what people thought he could have been... &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As with the untimely death of the Princess of Wales
almost two years ago for Britain, the death of 38-year-old JFK, Jr.
and his 33-year-old wife caught a moment when currents of
generations and social and political trends all came together as
neither before nor since.
</P>
<P>
   For Britain, the public outpouring of grief marked the passing
of a certain idea of the Royal Family; it sealed the decline of the
stiff upper lip as the defining feature of Englishness.
</P>
<P>
   There is a similarly unique crisscrossing of strands in the
United States now. Those in the prime of their power and influence,
driving the Kennedy nostalgia, are the JFK generation.
</P>
<P>
   As with the mourning for the Princess of Wales, the moment when
all the propitious currents converge is short and unlikely to be
repeated.
</P>
<P>
   Already, in the views of the 10 percent or so of Americans who
look askance at the shock and grief attending JFK Jr.'s death can
be divined the end of the Kennedy mystique... &QL;

   MARTHA'S VINEYARD _ John F. Kennedy, Jr. was not royalty, but he
was surely a prince. The only surviving son of an assassinated
president, he was also America's favorite son: impossibly good
looking, very rich and a perennial of gossip headlines and magazine
covers.

   Even his death _ apparent death _ was more poignant and more
strange than the most fertile of tabloid imaginations could have
mustered.

<P>
   ``A Fallen Son,'' said the front page of the Cape Cod Times. In
New York there were 25 pages of JFK, Jr. in the Post, 24 pages in
the Daily News. Only Princess Diana could beat him on the
newsstand.
</P>
<P>
   Now in death, his story resonates with the family tragedies that
came before _ in its sadness and the shock it delivers to America. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ When the news first broke Saturday morning that
John F. Kennedy, Jr.'s small plane was missing off the coast of
Long Island, a shudder went through the East Coast political and
media establishment. Could it really be that the ``curse'' had
struck again, felling another young and promising Kennedy in his
prime?
</P>
<P>
   His father, President John F. Kennedy, had met his premature
death at the hands of an assassin in Dallas in 1963. His uncle,
Robert, who aspired to follow in his brother's footsteps, was
assassinated five years later.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the death of JFK Jr. is not just another family member
lost to the ``curse.'' It is the end, in a way, of the JFK legend.
This is how Camelot has ended: in the black waters of the Atlantic,
at night. &QL;

 &HT;    Youth and politics a rare mix today
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Gina Cordero provides a little hope that,
someday, there may be more 18-year-olds at public meetings than at
local nightclubs.
</P>
<P>
   She just graduated from Colonel White High School after serving
as its student senate president. She attended school board
meetings, discussed her school's problems with elected officials,
and although it didn't count for the record, she voted.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Cordero got involved _ something that less and less of
America's youth seem to care about, political experts said Monday
at the Midwestern Legislative Conference in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is widespread concern that people between ages 18-24
don't care about civic involvement,'' said Kathleen Hall Jamieson,
professor and dean of the Annenberg School for Communication at the
University of Pennsylvania. ``(Studies show) they don't care about
politics, don't talk about issues with their parents, and they
think their civic leaders are all crooked and dishonest.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Former professional wrestler) Jesse Ventura was elected
Minnesota's governor because that state changed its fundamental
view of how they look at candidates and more young people came into
the fold. Instead of being afraid of that, we need to embrace it,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the mix of youth and politics has been declining for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Voter turnout among people between the ages of 18-24 in the 1996
presidential election was about 30 percent, which compares with 50
percent in 1972, according to the National Association of
Secretaries of State. A recent survey found that fewer than 20
percent of people in that same age group voted in last year's
congressional elections. Most of the young people contacted in the
survey said they received little civic education in school, and
rarely discussed politics at home.
</P>
<P>
   Jamieson, a national expert on political campaigns, and other
experts said scandals from Watergate to Monica Lewinsky have turned
off young people to politics. Jamieson also cited the familiar
political campaign attack ads and a steady stream of negative
political coverage from the media as primary reasons for staying
away from politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Dayton, I think we have gotten more young people out to
vote, but we have a problem, like other urban areas, in getting
young people involved in their communities,'' said state Rep. J.
Donald Mottley (R-West Carrollton, Ohio). ``We have such a
sound-bite mentality, and, too often, kids hear what's wrong
instead of how things are getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, Jamieson's public policy center created a
program that targeted students in 33 ``troubled'' urban high
schools, putting them in direct contact with the 1999 Philadelphia
mayoral primary campaign. The students conducted regular live
interviews with the candidates on local television and used the
Internet to monitor candidates' views on issues.
</P>
<P>
   The program worked on all levels.
</P>
<P>
   It encouraged more kids to vote, lowered the level of cynicism
in the campaign, and created extensive ``positive'' media coverage
for the schools and especially minority students.
</P>
<P>
   There have been signs that, locally, teens do care about what
affects them. Recently, students attended school board meetings to
speak out against potential cuts of programs and teachers because
of the district's financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should ask teens their opinions more often, because when
you do it's surprising how much they do care about their
environment,'' said state Sen. Rhine McLin (D-Dayton).
``Legislators, teachers, parents and the media all need to do more.
We have a tendency not to listen to our kids.''

CLINTON TO PRESS SYRIA TO REOPEN TALKS WITH ISRAEL

of Israel is being sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers can

 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton pledged Monday that he would
contact President Hafez Assad of Syria to stress that a ``golden
opportunity'' lay before him to complete a peace deal with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke as he and Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel
completed a series of meetings.
</P>
<P>
   From their joint announcement at a news conference of plans to
increase military assistance to Israel, to a plan to include
Israeli astronauts on a NASA shuttle journey next year, Clinton and
Barak appeared eager to show that the United States' relationship
with Israel has been reinvigorated.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders also announced that financing would be provided
for Israel's acquisition of additional Arrow anti-missile systems,
which could defend Israel against Iran and Iraq. This is one of
several measures that had been planned several years ago but
delayed during the tenure of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would ask Congress to expedite approval of
economic assistance to Israel, the Palestinian Authority and Jordan
that had been promised last fall on condition that the
land-for-security deal completed at Wye, Md., moved ahead. That
money has also been stalled because of the stalemate in carrying
out the Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will probably contact Assad by telephone in the coming
days, a senior administration official said. By reaching out to
Assad, Clinton will be taking the first step in the process that
Barak has said he hopes will result in a basis for a comprehensive
Middle East settlement within 15 months.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to his telephone and other contacts over the years
with Assad, Clinton said at the news conference, ``He knows very
well that I am committed to the peace process between Israel and
Syria and that I believe that he has a golden opportunity now to
resume that process.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who met with Assad in Geneva in 1994, said the United
States ``would like more normal relations with Syria.'' Syria is
one of the last Arab states officially at war with Israel and is
critical to achieving the overall Middle East settlement that Barak
says he envisions.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said Clinton would tell Assad of
Barak's determination to move forward and will try to find out what
Syria wants or expects in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But the officials also said Clinton hopes to reduce the
traditional role of intermediary that the United States has played
between Syria and Israel. During this process, there has been no
direct contact between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we proceed that way, nothing will get done in 15 months,''
a senior administration official said. ``We hope to see more direct
contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Syria remains on the State Department's list of nations that it
says support terrorism. But a report from the Middle East on Monday
said that Syria had called on guerrillas that it supports in
Lebanon to ``call off the armed struggle'' and to transform
themselves into political groups.
</P>
<P>
   An official in Barak's delegation said that the report was
almost ``too good to be true'' but could be an encouraging sign
about the purposefulness of Assad's recent statements that he
wanted to resume negotiations with Israel. Clinton and Barak both
welcomed the reports, while cautioning that they were uncertain
whether the accounts were accurate.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing increased military assistance, which needs
congressional approval, the administration was also outlining a
plan under discussion for some time to restructure aid to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Under this new formula, the United States would phase out
economic assistance, now $1.2. billion a year, while increasing
military assistance. Israel now receives $1.8 billion a year in
military assistance, and in $60 million increments over the next 10
years, this would be increased to $2.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The phaseout of economic assistance comes as the Israeli economy
has grown more robust and more integrated into the global market.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In another indication of their new confidence, the two leaders
announced they would establish a strategic policy planning group
composed of senior U.S. and Israeli security officials that would
report to them every four months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two leaders agreed to meet in joint session at regular
intervals,'' the joint communique they released said in reference
to the planning group.
</P>
<P>
   A group like this was proposed during the negotiations at Wye,
but, administration officials said, it would have lacked the
authority to make meaningful recommendations or decisions on
Israel's security needs. ``It was a good idea that never got off
the ground,'' a senior administration official said. ``The new
committee will do more, more frequently and meet with the prime
minister and the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new formulation, the officials would consider ways to
enhance Israel's security in the face of a comprehensive peace
settlement, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In their communique, the two leaders said they would sign a new
agreement allowing for ``broad cooperation'' between various
agencies of both governments on responding to the threat of
terrorism by means of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   On the sensitive issue of Jonathan Jay Pollard, a former U.S.
Navy intelligence analyst who is serving a life sentence in the
United States for spying for Israel, Barak declined to comment at
the news conference, beyond saying he would like to see him
released.
</P>
<P>
   Pollard was arrested in 1985, pleaded guilty and was given a
life sentence in 1987. Clinton has twice denied clemency to
Pollard. But on the last day of the talks at Wye last year, Clinton
pledged to Netanyahu that he would review the Pollard case. Clinton
asked Charles Ruff, the White House counsel, to compile an
interagency report on whether Pollard should be released.
</P>
<P>
   After the news conference, the national security adviser, Sandy
Berger, said that Barak, like all other Israeli prime ministers who
had met with Clinton, had raised the issue of Pollard's status with
the president.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said Clinton had not yet received the report from Ruff.
</P>
<P>
   According to Berger's account of the conversation between
Clinton and Barak on the Pollard case, the prime minister said that
the Pollard case should not be part of the peace negotiations. At
Wye, Netanyahu had threatened to walk out unless Pollard was
released.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   By accounts from American and Israeli officials, Barak and
Clinton, who did not know each other well before the prime minister
arrived last Wednesday, developed a good rapport during two,
lengthy one-on-one sessions and then over meals and at other
meetings during the visit.
</P>
<P>
   But both leaders were short on details at their news conference
Monday on what the unfolding peace efforts might look like. Barak
said it was ``too early'' to talk about the results of permanent
status talks between the Palestinians and Israel on difficult
questions like borders, refugees and the disposition of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he saw a Palestinian state emerging from the talks
by the end of the year, Barak said, ``I am confident that the
nature of the Palestinian entity will emerge quite naturally out of
these permanent status negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak had his last scheduled meeting with Clinton at the White
House on Monday afternoon. Earlier, the prime minister met with
officials of the American Israel Political Action Committee, a
national organization that lobbies Congress on behalf of Israeli
issues.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, his last day in the United States, Barak will hold a
series of meetings on Capitol Hill and attend a lunch to be held by
Vice President Al Gore in his residence.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Just after World War II, John Gunther wrote in ``Inside
U.S.A.'' that ``the remarkable thing about Denver is its ineffable
closedness,'' calling it ``probably the most self-sufficient,
isolated and complacent city in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Half a century later, a visitor who arrives here clutching
Gunther's book as a guide will feel like Rip van Winkle.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Japan opened a consulate here. In April, China's
prime minister, Zhu Rongji, visited. This week, Air Canada
inaugurated a daily flight to Winnipeg, its fifth Canadian
destination from its mini-hub at Denver's airport.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Mayor Wellington E. Webb plans to play host to
African heads of state for a meeting here on development and
democracy. In the fall, Britain plans to open here its first new
consulate the United States in more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denver was the brightest candidate,'' Sir Christopher Meyer,
the British ambassador to the United States, said from Washington.
``We want to tap into a booming American economy, to get into those
cities and those regions where economic power and cutting-edge
technology have moved significantly ahead in recent years.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the rapid internationalization of this city, 1,000
miles from the nearest seaport, is perhaps the highest profile
example of a larger trend: the increasing integration of the
nation's interior into the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more international travel is taking place from
nontraditional ports of entry _ Salt Lake City, Kansas City,
Philadelphia and Pittsburgh _ but Denver is probably the one that
has seen the most of it,'' said Thomas Nulty, president of Navigant
Travel, a national network of travel agencies based here.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade, Nulty said, his company's international
business had increased 40 percent nationwide but almost 200 percent
in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   A strong economy and the boom in information technology are
rapidly plugging interior cities into the wider world, said Jerry
W. Leach, executive director of the World Affairs Councils of
America, an association based in Washington with members from 83
American cities.
</P>
<P>
   In Denver, globalization results from several factors, including
the metropolitan area's emergence as a high-technology center, a
cosmopolitan change in the area's population mix and the new
airport, which opened in 1995 and cost $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by these factors, almost 200 foreign companies from 22
nations have invested a total of nearly $500 million in Colorado,
employing 30,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the airport, the fax machine, the e-mail _ 25, no 15
years ago, I could not do what I am doing out of Denver,'' said
Gary Hart, who left Washington after his Senate term expired in
1986 to work here as an international lawyer for Coudert Brothers,
a law firm based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the growth in foreign ties here, the ranks of
international lawyers in Colorado have grown to 200 from virtually
none a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, Colorado has recorded one of the nation's fastest
growth rates in high-technology employment: 43 percent.
Forty-thousand jobs have been added in such areas as
telecommunications, software and information technology.
High-technology products account for about 70 percent of Colorado's
$5 billion in annual overseas exports.
</P>
<P>
   This new economy has drawn a more cosmopolitan migrant to a
state historically populated by transplants. Long viewed as where
the Midwest meets the mountains, Colorado has seen migration from
the Midwest drop by half since 1980. Today, more than half of
Colorado's new residents come from the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts,
historically areas with a more outward-looking world view.
</P>
<P>
   The city is also becoming more ethnically diverse. Greater
Denver now supports weekly newspapers in Chinese, Korean, Russian
and Spanish. Besides dozens of Chinese and Mexican restaurants,
Denver has restaurants specializing in the cuisines of Brazil,
Ethiopia, Greece, Indonesia, Jamaica, Morocco, Nepal and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colorado is a state that has an extraordinarily open attitude
to integrating different cultures, races and origins,'' said Carlos
Barros Horcasitas, the Mexican consul here.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   More and more, foreigners seeking to understand the United
States or to influence policies place Denver on their itineraries.
Visitors in April included Ghana's president, Jerry J. Rawlings,
who addressed a meeting of the National Conference of Black Mayors;
Jose Ramos-Horta, the independence advocate for East Timor, and
Julien Clerc, the French singer, who started his North American
tour here.
</P>
<P>
   Denver is now a stop for about 15 percent of the roughly 4,500
international visitors to whom the U.S. Information Agency plays
host each year.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these visitors come here through connecting flights. But
with the start of Korean Airlines' direct flights to Seoul, the
South Korean capital, in 1997 and British Airways' nonstop service
to Gatwick Airport outside London in 1998, foreign trade officials
say they believe that Denver's airport will gradually become a
truly international hub. In addition to the airport's flights to
five Canadian cities, it has direct flights to four Mexican beach
resorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Denver's altitude, long-distance jets always had problems
taking off fully loaded,'' said Marc L. Holtzman, Colorado
secretary for international trade, technology and innovation,
referring to the city's mile-high altitude. ``But with the
technology improving, the introduction of the Boeing 777s and the
Airbus A-340s definitely favor a city like Denver for European and
Asian flights.''
</P>
<P>
   From a small base, international passenger traffic through
Denver is up 48 percent this year over last year, reaching 270,000
for the first four months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   As high-technology exports decline in weight and increase in
value, air cargo is supplanting the need for an outlet to the sea
for foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that the Dutch, the Portuguese, all these
peoples from coastal nations were the traders,'' Mayor Webb
observed. ``Well, the air is our ocean. It allows us to move back
and forth, east and west, to keep our economy strong. That is our
port.''
</P>
<P>
   There are downsides to integrating into the world economy. Last
year, the state's ski resort officials set an informal goal of
selling 10 percent of all ski-lift tickets to foreigners, who spend
heavily in mountain restaurants, hotels and shops. But officials
had not calculated on the declining Canadian dollar, now trading at
68 American cents. As European skiers chose the Canadian Rockies
over the American Rockies, ski ticket sales at Vail plunged by 16.5
percent last winter, while lift ticket sales at Vail's main
Canadian rival, Whistler-Blackcomb, jumped by 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And city and company officials here struggle to cope with the
almost daily flood of foreign visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Reis, president of the World Trade Center Denver, a private
company, said: ``We told the Danish consul general, `Please don't
come to Denver at the end of May. We are going to be inundated.' A
Chinese delegation just showed up on our doorstep when I asked them
not to. We knew we couldn't set up meetings for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar foreign interest is felt at the Denver World Affairs
Council, said Karen de Bartolome, the group's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now could do all our programming simply by responding to
people who want to come to Denver,'' Ms. de Bartolome said of the
group's foreign affairs speakers series.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Webb, who led a delegation of 11 other American mayors on
a 10-day trip to Senegal, Ghana and Nigeria in May, easily brushes
off any criticism of his efforts to increase Denver's foreign trade
and ties. The mayor, who was overwhelmingly elected to a third term
the week before his West Africa trip, said: ``There will always be
someone who will second-guess the trips, who will say, `The mayor
doesn't need to be in Africa, the mayor doesn't need to be in
London _ that's a 1940s, myopic point of view.''

WORLD CUP TRIUMPH `ABOUT CHANGING THE RULES ONCE AND FOR ALL'
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Women's World Cup soccer champions visited the
White House on Monday for a celebration that was tinged with
melancholy over the apparently fatal flight of John F. Kennedy Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know this is both a moment of celebration and a moment
of sadness for the United States, and our thoughts and prayers are
with the families of John Kennedy and Carolyn and Lauren
Bessette,'' President Clinton said in addressing the American team
on the South Lawn of the White House, referring to Kennedy's wife
and sister-in-law, who disappeared with him Friday night on a
flight from New Jersey to Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is at times like this,'' the president continued, ``that we
really stop to recognize that, as big and diverse as our country
is, we can come together as a national family. We can come together
in sorrow or in joy if it reflects the values that we honor most.
This is one of those moments.''
</P>
<P>
   Carla Overbeck, the U.S. team captain, said that it was a
``horrible day for America'' and added that there had been some
question whether the ceremony would be postponed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can bring a glimmer of hope or a smile to someone's
face, then that would be great,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to a crowd of young soccer players, along with their
parents, Clinton, who attended the World Cup quarterfinals in
suburban Washington and the final at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena,
Calif., said the triumph by the U.S. team had ``surely become
America's triumph.''
</P>
<P>
   The suspense of the penalty-kick victory over China in the
championship game on July 10 was so great, Clinton said, he
``actually almost fell out of the sky box.'' Noting the crucial
save that goalkeeper Briana Scurry made in the penalty-kick phase,
he joked: ``If I had to do it all over again, I'd like to be a
goalie. No pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said: ``The day after the game, a lot of us who aren't
so young anymore were trying to search the whole cluttered attic of
our memories to try to think if there was ever a time when there
had been a more exciting climax to an athletic event that had meant
as much to so many. I'm not sure that in my lifetime there has
been.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton, remarking that she had been a mediocre
athlete in the days when women played halfcourt basketball, said
that the World Cup triumph was ``about changing the rules once and
for all'' about women in sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have exploded the myth that women can't attract fans and
public attention,'' she said. ``It's about time that is
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   The American players, dressed in lavender shirts and navy pants
suits, gave the president a No. 99 jersey and the first lady a
crystal figurine of a soccer player. Vice President Al Gore and his
wife, Tipper, also greeted the players and received an autographed
soccer ball.
</P>
<P>
   The players later accompanied Mrs. Clinton to Cape Canaveral,
Fla., for the launching after midnight of the first space shuttle
mission to be piloted by a female commander, Lt. Col. Eileen
Collins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming to the White House is honorable; to be part of a NASA
launch is unbelievable, once in a lifetime,'' forward Tiffeny
Milbrett said.  &QL;

 &HT;    Bush releases names of top donors
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush on Monday released the
previously secret list of big-money fund-raisers, called Pioneers,
who have helped make him the all-time heavyweight champion of
campaign cash collection.
</P>
<P>
   The head of Bush's ``pioneers'' program said its participants,
including those who have hit the $100,000 goal and those still
working toward it, have produced about 40 percent of the record $37
million Bush has collected since beginning his campaign in March,
or about $13.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 115 Bush backers have hit the $100,000 target bringing
in at least $11.5 million, according to Jim Francis, coordinator of
the program. As many as 300 more are trying to get there, he said.
If they're successful, that translates into an additional $30
million for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, Bush agreed with critics who said his campaign _
not six wealthy supporters who already had hit the contribution cap
_ should have paid the $43,500 rent on a rally site at next month's
Iowa straw poll.
</P>
<P>
   Bush decided to release the pioneers list Monday while facing
increasing pressure from public-interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the pioneers are using other people's money to buy
influence with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average American is not in a position to raise $100,000
for a political campaign,'' Craig McDonald of the Austin-based
Texans for Public Justice said in a Monday letter asking Bush to
name the pioneers. ``Indeed, the limited number of Bush pioneers
who have been identified by the media comprise a who's who of the
nation's powerful business and lobby elite. Many of these people
have keen interests in the outcome of federal policies.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald, whose group monitors political spending, also told
Bush the pioneer system could be a subterfuge around federal law
limiting contributions to $1,000 per person.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the Center for Responsive Politics, another
non-profit group that watches the flow of political money, said
Bush's decision to release the list was ``a positive step.''
</P>
<P>
   But Paul Hendrie, the organization's communications director,
was not as encouraged by the fact that the pioneers program has
produced 40 percent of Bush's money.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an extraordinary total, especially when we are talking
about the huge sums of money the governor has raised,'' Hendrie
said. ``Obviously the people responsible for raising $100,000 or
more are in a position to have a very exclusive level of access and
influence on the candidate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said there is nothing nefarious about what the pioneers are
doing for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not bundling,'' he said, using the term generally applied
to efforts to circumvent spending limits. ``It's an organizational
effort.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got people who are willing to say, `I want to take the
extra step in organizing to help George W. raise money, and I'm
very grateful and very humbled by it,'' said Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The list includes business, personal and political friends Bush
has picked up over the years. Michigan Gov. John Engler is a
pioneer. So are state U.S. Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Washington, Sen.
Teel Bivins, R-Amarillo, Colorado Gov. Bill Owens, former U.S. Sen.
Rudy Boschwitz of Minnesota, Former U.S. Rep. Tom Loeffler of Texas
and former Florida Gov. Bob Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   From the business world, the list includes Rusty Rose of Texas
and Roland Betts of New York, a former Bush partner in the Texas
Rangers baseball team; Bill DeWitt of Ohio, a former Bush partner
in the energy business,; Kenneth Lay of Houston, chief executive
officer of Enron; Robert Dedman, chairman of ClubCorp
International, and Austinite Bud Shivers.
</P>
<P>
   Francis said the pioneers project was his idea, hatched last
December, months before Bush publicly acknowledged he wants to be
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how many people came up to me and said, `I
want to do something really special. I really want to get involved.
I really want to do something for George and I want to give you a
big portion of my life,''' said Francis, a Dallas businessman and
longtime Bush friend.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the pioneers have been at Bush fund-raising events in
recent weeks. In San Diego last month, businessman Gerald Issa said
working toward the $100,000 target has been easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just asked people. And people are calling me up and saying
`How do I get involved.' I've never had an easier job,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, Bush said he agrees with critics who blasted him
for allowing six wealthy supporters to send a total of $50,000 to
the Iowa Republican Party to pay for Bush's rally site at next
month's straw poll there.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the Bush campaign bid $43,500 for the site
adjacent to the coliseum where the event will be held. Last week,
six supporters wrote personal checks of $10,000 or $5,000 to pay
for the site and other straw poll-related expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes campaign said the checks amounted to violations of
the $1,000 cap on individual contributions. Each of the check
writers already had given Bush $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes and Iowa GOP officials said Friday
the checks were legal because they were merely donations to the
state party, not money spent to forward Bush's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Bush asked the Iowa GOP to refund the checks.
Instead, his campaign will send the money.

SHHHH: BUSH IS BUYING UP LAND IN CENTRAL TEXAS. PASS IT ON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CRAWFORD, Texas _ That Texas Gov. George W. Bush is shopping for
ranch land seven miles from this hardscrabble town of 631 is the
worst-kept secret in Central Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of endless vanloads of gawkers traipsing past what
could be the ``Western White House'' makes some folks giddy with
the thought that it might revive the local economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if he's Republican or Democrat. Anything that
will wake the snakes in this community is fine with me,'' exclaimed
Bobby Driver, 57, owner of the Coffee Station cafe, famous for its
cinnamon rolls and one of two active businesses in the town 18
miles west of Waco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it'll get us a grocery,'' Patsy Connolly suggested,
hopefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which we need,'' added Judy Clemons, 59. ``Haven't had one in
five years.''
</P>
<P>
   But a few dread the idea that the front-runner for the
Republican presidential nomination might become a neighbor. Traffic
has already picked up noticeably, attributed to the curious hoping
to catch a glimpse of the property.
</P>
<P>
   The ranch is off Prairie Chapel Road, a winding rural
thoroughfare of pea gravel and asphalt, past Old Beulah Road, the
Broken Spoke Ranch, past the house with an upset owner and a very
mean black dog, then through the shade of generation-old hackberry
trees.
</P>
<P>
   The woman who warns visitors to beware of her less-than-friendly
pooch said she isn't at all happy about having famous new
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather Bush buy somewhere else,'' she said. ``I moved out
here 40 years ago for the peace and quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   The family selling the land, the Engelbrechts, had offered to
buy her out a few weeks before word of Bush's interest became
public. The woman, who refused, was not given a reason for the
sudden interest in her property.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way I'd go is feet first,'' said the woman, who
agreed to be interviewed only in exchange for anonymity, to
preserve her privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The Engelbrechts, whose forebears began farming in the county
just after the Civil War, are embarrassed by all the talk and media
attention, which they trace to a leak by a Republican state
legislator.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest circus I've ever seen,'' said Kenneth
Engelbrecht, 57, the reluctant spokesman for his father, Ben, who
is selling the land.
</P>
<P>
   And, he insisted, ``The sale hasn't concluded yet.''
</P>
<P>
   But relatives and neighbors speak as if it's a done deal, some
saying that Bush is planning to announce the purchase himself at a
breakfast gathering for locals. A Gatesville real estate agent has
declined to comment, and Bush's spokespeople will say only that the
deal hasn't been concluded. The asking price hasn't been disclosed
as of yet.
</P>
<P>
   If the sale goes through, Bush will get close to 1,500 acres,
which include two houses; a number of corrugated coops that once
housed tens of thousands of laying hens, broilers and turkeys; a
scenic creek bottom, and suitable terrain for construction of a
fishing lake _ reportedly one of the governor's requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Engelbrecht described the small valley as a little slice
of Colorado. The two Engelbrecht men and their wives live on the
ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Engelbrecht said he'd stay on for a year while the
Bushes build a home and the lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blood, sweat and tears went into that land,'' Engelbrecht
said. ``We wanted to do right for the town, right for the land. The
land has been good to us. It'll be here for eternity if they take
care of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben Engelbrecht started out with 100 acres given to him by his
father and worked it up to 15 times that amount by farming corn and
cotton and by grazing cattle and raising poultry, which produced
60,000 turkeys one year, said his older brother Marvin, 87, who
called him a whiz at business.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a small child, we were the only folks with a hired
hand,'' said Kenneth Engelbrecht. ``My father said he could make
more money on the telephone, speculating on commodities _ and he
did.''
</P>
<P>
   The family traces its Texas roots to the 1859 arrival of Henry
Engelbrecht, who had immigrated from the German state of Westphalia
to a farm near Brenham. He soon found himself wearing Confederate
gray. During Reconstruction, he moved to Central Texas in search of
water, pasture and trees, said his grandson Marvin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush has been up here, two, three, four times,'' Kenneth
Engelbrecht said as he overlooked a field of winter Klein grass.
``He's got a heritage. And we come from a long line of heritage.
And if he makes president, they'll be here for a long time.''

FED MULLS REACTION TO Y2K FEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal Reserve officials may further adjust the supply of cash
on hand at the end of the year to meet public expectations about
the computer software problem known as Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the Fed keeps about $150 billion in its vaults. In
its annual currency order last August the Fed asked the Treasury
Department to print up an extra $50 billion to cover possible
withdrawals by people who fret that banks' systems and automatic
teller machines might be interrupted by software glitches after
Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   With the time for its next big currency order approaching next
month, Fed officials said Monday they are studying whether to
increase or decrease the $50 billion set-aside based on how
seriously the public regards the threat of Y2K-related problems.
</P>
<P>
   The decision will be delicate, because public expectations might
be influenced by how concerned the Fed appears. Since last year
banks have made much progress fixing their software, Fed officials
noted, suggesting customers might have more confidence that any
problems at their banks will be minor.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, in an interview last week Paul Connolly, the
Boston Fed's chief operating officer, suggested the total amount of
extra cash kept on hand might go as high as $70 billion to help
provide ``a super-abundance'' of money at the time of the date
change.
</P>
<P>
   But other bank officials downplayed that figure. ``Nothing has
changed in our overall assessment of the amount of cash that will
be needed here,'' said Boston Fed spokesman Thomas L. Lavelle.
</P>
<P>
   ``In time we've become more optimistic about the other payment
options remaining available and the general public becoming less
concerned about the issue as a whole,'' Lavelle said. Rose
Pianalto, spokeswoman for the Fed in Washington, said she doubted
more extra cash would be ordered.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far there's no sign'' that banks have begun to seek extra
cash to satisfy the needs of their customers, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K, short for year 2000, refers to a glitch in many older
computer systems that use just two digits to represent the current
year. When 99 becomes ``00'' some systems might be confused about
what year is indicated and crash or shut down.
</P>
<P>
   To combat the problem, banks, electric utilities, telephone
companies, and public agencies across the country are spending
about $100 billion to upgrade their computer systems, according to
the consulting firm Gartner Group Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The financial sector is considered relatively advanced in its
Y2K-preparedness efforts, and bank examiners have vowed to punish
or close down institutions that don't meet certain target dates in
their work to upgrade their systems. So far only about 2 percent of
the country's 10,400 federally insured institutions have made
unsatisfactory progress, officials say, an improvement from 4
percent a year ago. Most of the laggards are expected to catch up
in coming months, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has also pressed individual banks to familiarize
customers with their own efforts. In that vein, major local banks,
including Fleet Financial Group Inc. and BankBoston Corp., said
they met a June 30 target date to complete reviews of their systems
considered critical to stay in business.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston economist Wayne Ayers said he would be comfortable
even if the Fed winds up increasing the money supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're in uncharted territory as far as what people will do,
so it's better to be safe than sorry,'' Ayers said. Even if the
cash isn't demanded by customers, Ayers said, the Treasury
Department can put the extra funds into circulation later on.

HIGH DRAMA PRODUCES UNEXPECTED VICTOR AT BRITISH OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARNOUSTIE, Scotland _ This year's British Open will be
remembered both for its drama and for its difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   Many players thought the course setup at Carnoustie was too
severe. And the winning score of 290 was the tournament's highest
since 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, while not everyone had fun playing, the finish was riveting
and the winner was unexpected. Paul Lawrie of Scotland, the victor
in a four-hole playoff with Justin Leonard and Jean Van de Velde,
has now won more majors than David Duval, Colin Montgomerie and
Phil Mickelson combined: one. Even Lawrie admitted he never thought
he would be the next Scottish player to win a major championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think Monty is very happy for me,'' Lawrie said of
Montgomerie. ``You would assume he would beat me to a major
championship, but he hasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The three majors so far this year have each presented different,
yet compelling story lines. And next month's P.G.A. Championship at
Medinah Country Club outside Chicago may be hard-pressed to top
them.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Maria Olazabal's victory at Augusta in the Masters
completed a comeback from foot pain that jeopardized his career.
Payne Stewart won the U.S. Open with one of the sport's greatest
putts, an 18-footer on the final hole that edged Mickelson by a
stroke.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing was quite like Sunday, when Van de Velde stepped to
the 18th tee with a three-stroke lead, only to squander it with a
triple bogey that cost him the biggest triumph of his career. One
can hope that Van de Velde recovers, but there is no guarantee that
he will ever come that close to winning a major again.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old Lawrie deserved credit for overcoming a
10-stroke deficit on Sunday, and for not allowing Carnoustie to
break him mentally, while so many other players were better at
complaining about the conditions than they were at making birdies.
Lawrie, who never broke 70 until Sunday (73-74-76-67), just kept
playing on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the golf course was set up very, very tough,''
Lawrie said. ``When six over makes a playoff to win a major, maybe
there's something a little bit too tough. I just went ahead and did
my job. I didn't moan. I just tried to focus and do my thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He did it beautifully, elevating his career to a new level, and
making another statement about the quality of European golf. Two of
this year's three majors have been won by Europeans, and Lawrie's
victory snapped a four-year winning streak by Americans at the
British Open.
</P>
<P>
   The victory guaranteed that Lawrie will be part of the European
team that will play the United States at the Ryder Cup in
September, and the European contingent is looking stronger by the
week. Van de Velde will probably be on the team as well, as should
Sergio Garcia, Spain's 19-year-old phenom, who missed the cut at
the British Open with an embarrassing score of 30 over par.
</P>
<P>
   After this year's scores, it will be interesting to see how long
it takes the tournament committee of the Royal &AMP; Ancient to return
another British Open to Carnoustie. Next year's open will be at St.
Andrew's, a special place in itself, but Carnoustie is one of a
kind. And while nobody came close to making par for the tournament,
most players wanted another crack at Carnoustie one day, especially
if the fairways were kept at their normal width, instead of being
narrowed for the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed in the course setup, but my view of the
British Open hasn't changed,'' Stewart said. ``I love the
tournament, and I think it is the foremost golf tournament in the
world. Even being an American and having won two U.S. Opens, I've
always held the British Open dear to my heart, and it would really
complete my career if I could win one.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, it was Lawrie's turn to celebrate. And he deserved
it, pulling off the greatest final-round comeback in major
championship history and ensuring that he will always be a hero in
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother and father both play golf, but they won't mind me
saying they're not very good,'' Lawrie said. ``No one in my family
has really ever been any good playing golf.''
</P>
<P>
   And what did Lawrie plan to do with his winnings?
</P>
<P>
   ``I shall buy myself a Ferrari,'' he said. &QL;

KENNEDY'S CREATION, GEORGE, WAS STRUGGLING
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: This is an updated version of a story sent Sunday night and
HELD. Please discard the earlier story; use only this version.) 
 (jw) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON and ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John F. Kennedy Jr. had in recent weeks begun to
discuss the fate of his nearly four-year-old political magazine,
George, with advisers at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., the investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, an executive close to the talks said, was discussing
with advisers strategic options. In particular, the executive said,
Kennedy, who is presumed dead at sea, had hoped to find a financial
partner and had come up with a list of companies he was interested
in approaching.
</P>
<P>
   Since the spring there have been reports about what would happen
to George once the publishing contract between Hachette Filipacchi
Magazines and Kennedy's Random Ventures expired at the end of this
year. It was reported that Kennedy had met with Conde Nast chief
executive Steven Florio, among others.
</P>
<P>
   James Truman, editorial director of Conde Nast, said Monday that
Kennedy had recently approached Conde Nast seeking partnership, but
the company had decided against the idea.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the executive close to the talks said, Kennedy
had expanded his list of potential investors, including Henry
Kravis, a partner in Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &AMP; Co., the leveraged
buyout firm.
</P>
<P>
   In advertising and circulation, George is not faring well. Total
advertising pages have fallen by nearly one-third, to 247 for the
first six months of this year, compared with 360 for the first six
months of 1998, the Publishers Information Bureau reported. And
newsstand sales of copies _ the closely monitored gauge of public
enthusiasm for a magazine _ fell by 28.2 percent, to 90,867 copies
an issue, in the last six months of 1998. In that same period,
total paid circulation dropped 5 percent, to 405,894.
</P>
<P>
   From its debut in October 1995 until earlier this year, George
had an enthusiastic supporter in David Pecker, who was the
president and chief executive of Hachette Filipacchi Magazines, the
unit of the Paris-based Lagardere Group that publishes the
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   But Pecker left Hachette in March to become chief executive of
American Media, the company that publishes The National Enquirer,
and executives say his replacement, Jack Kliger, has not been as
confident in George or in Kennedy's skills as a journalist.
</P>
<P>
   A Hachette executive confirmed that since taking over as chief
executive in April, Kliger had been in discussions with Kennedy
about the future of the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the magazine's problems on the business side, it was
always the recipient of bountiful publicity. As an editor, Kennedy
generated more attention than almost any other editor in chief in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   In March, at a news conference to announce that former Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., would be a George advice columnist,
Kennedy caused a flurry of media attention when he floated the
possibility that he might run for mayor of New York City. And in
May he attracted a healthy round of publicity when he invited Larry
Flynt, Hustler magazine publisher, to sit at the George magazine
table at the White House Correspondents Association dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Hachette said Monday that the company would not
discuss the future of the magazine until the Kennedy family had
issued a statement. But one executive said that the magazine would
probably publish for two or three more issues, then close. ``The
magazine died with John, I think,'' the executive said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the magazine is a partnership between Random Ventures
and Hachette and only half-owned by Hachette, Hachette has less
incentive to keep the magazine financed than if it was the full
owner. There is no way to know yet to whom Kennedy entrusted Random
Ventures in the case of his death, and whether that person would
choose to continue to run the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Citing their respect for the Kennedy family, George editors and
staff members said Monday that they would not give interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, grief counselors consoled George staff members, and
bouquets of wildflowers and roses piled up at the front doors of
Hachette headquarters at 1633 Broadway. Extra security was called
in to turn away dozens of well-wishers.

KENNEDY FLIGHT MAY HAVE ENDED IN OUT-OF-CONTROL PLUNGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: More to be filed by 9:30 p.m.) 
(mk) 
 By MIKE ALLEN and CAREY GOLDBERG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOURNE, Mass. _ The last flight of John F. Kennedy Jr. ended in
a terrifying, out-of-control plunge at 10 times the normal rate for
a descent, according to radar data released Monday, offering a
possible explanation for searchers' failure to recover remains or
significant pieces of wreckage from the Friday night crash off
Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   With the nation waiting and a thunderstorm threatening,
Massachusetts State Police divers began fishing through choppy,
murky waters off Martha's Vineyard for the first time since the
crash but came up with nothing, according to the authorities. One
object that sonar maps showed could be a big hunk of airplane
turned out to be a 14-foot boulder.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement late Monday, Kennedy's uncle, Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass., solemnly acknowledged what the Coast Guard had
determined Sunday night _ that the crash had apparently killed
Kennedy, who was 38, and his two passengers: his wife of nearly
three years, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33, and his sister-in-law,
Lauren Bessette, 34.
</P>
<P>
   ``John was a shining light in all our lives, and in the lives of
the nation and the world that first came to know him when he was a
little boy,'' Kennedy said. ``We pray that John, Carolyn and Lauren
will find eternal rest, and that God's perpetual light will shine
on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kennedy had become personally involved in the search as
early as 7 a.m. Saturday, when he called Gov. John Rowland of
Connecticut to ask for help searching the Long Island Sound area.
Rowland immediately dispatched National Guard helicopters to help
with the search, which gripped the nation as it played out on live
television all weekend.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Monday evening at Otis Air National Guard
Base here, investigators said that as Kennedy headed east toward
Martha's Vineyard, where he was trying to land before hopping over
to Hyannis for a family wedding, his single-engine, six-seat Piper
fell 1,100 feet in the final four seconds recorded on radar, one
hour after he left Fairfield, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Pearce of the National Transportation Safety Board, who
is leading the investigation, refused to characterize the drop
beyond pointing out that it was about 4,700 feet per minute.
Aviation authorities said a typical descent would be 400 to 500
feet per minute. Put another way, they said, Kennedy was going 50
mph straight down, possibly in a dive. Investigators and pilots
said it was still too early to say why the plane would descend at
that rate, but that it showed a severe problem such as pilot
incapacitation or equipment failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would indicate the airplane is out of control,'' said
Rudy Kapustin, who worked as an accident investigator at the NTSB
for 24 years, ending in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Kapustin said the pilot might have begun a normal turn but lost
sight of the horizon, then made the turn too tight, banking the
plane too far over and losing lift. ``That rate of descent is
extremely high, and there is no good reason, no operational reason,
why he would intentionally enter into that kind of rate of
descent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port, the tall American flag
continued to fly at full mast as evening fell, and family members
remained silent despite the tent city of reporters camped in front.
Only one major movement could be observed: the exodus of trucks
carrying equipment _ a generator, planks for a dance floor, tent
poles _ that had been rented for the wedding of Rory Kennedy, a
cousin of Juhn F. Kennedy Jr. The wedding had been scheduled for
Saturday and now has been postponed.
</P>
<P>
   Ethel and Max Kennedy could be seen out on the water for a short
sail. The family received communion in the morning from a priest in
white vestments. But otherwise, little movement was visible behind
the white picket fence of Marchant Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans remained stunned by the demise of the man they
had watched grow from ``John-John'' to ``the Hunk'' to the
publisher of a glitzy political magazine, George. As an indication
of the interest in the case, CNN and MSNBC broke away from a news
conference by President Clinton to cover a statement by the family
of Carolyn Kennedy Bessette, issued at their home in Greenwich,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference on Cape Cod, the authorities said no one
has reported seeing the plane crash. In a potential break for
investigators, Pearce said preliminary information from the plane's
previous owner is ``that there is a device that records possibly
the last transmission through the radio, which would be to
air-traffic control, over the transmitter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not know how this particular device works as yet, and we
are trying to determine if it was operational,'' Pearce added.
</P>
<P>
   A salvage ship and a submersible camera, both from the Navy,
arrived Monday to help with the search over 24 square miles off Gay
Head, the western tip of Martha's Vineyard. But the going has been
slow, and divers returned to shore before dark, as rain rolled in.
Pearce said searchers had recovered ``numerous small pieces of the
airplane, primarily interior cabin molding, some of the rugs, some
of the cushions, a rudder pedal,'' plus ``the right main landing
gear, which included the wheel and the brake assembly but not the
strut that would extend up above it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been no other exterior sheet metal of the airplane
recovered,'' he added. The largest piece found so far, he said, was
a rug that is about two feet square.

KENNEDY WAS SOUGHT AS SENATE CANDIDATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ John F. Kennedy Jr. was sought out as a possible
candidate for a New York Senate seat but declined to run even
before Hillary Rodham Clinton expressed interest in the race,
according to a senator who spoke with him.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert G. Torricelli, D-N.J., and chairman of the
Democratic Senate Campaign Committee, said he called Kennedy after
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan announced last November that he would
not seek re-election in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli said Kennedy told him he might be interested later
but the timing was not right and he would not seek the seat. This
was more than a month before Mrs. Clinton's name emerged as a
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speculation that John Kennedy was not a candidate for the
U.S. Senate because of Hillary Clinton is not accurate,''
Torricelli said in an interview Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Kennedy was an obvious possible choice,'' said
Torricelli, who helps to recruit Senate candidates and raise money
for them and who was among the first to mention Mrs. Clinton's name
publicly in February.
</P>
<P>
   He said he also spoke with Kennedy's cousin, Robert F. Kennedy
Jr., an environmental lawyer in New York, as well as with Andrew M.
Cuomo, the secretary of housing and urban development and the son
of former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, and with H. Carl McCall, the state
comptroller, but they were cool as well.
</P>
<P>
   Of John Kennedy, Torricelli said: ``He listened carefully, he
was attentive to the suggestions, he approached it thoughtfully and
seriously. But his response was, it might be an interest he had in
his life but the timing wasn't right, that it was something to be
approached again in a matter of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli said he called Kennedy twice about the matter, but
then dropped it because he was clearly not interested. But the
senator also said that Kennedy appeared to be using his magazine,
George, as a vehicle to become more familiar with public policy
issues and that this was perhaps a way to lay the groundwork for a
future run for office.

MOURNERS LEAVE FLOWERS AT KENNEDY BIRTHPLACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MEG VAILLANCOURT AND ROB NELSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Like mercy, a gentle rain fell as mourners found their
way to the green-shingled house on a quiet Brookline street where
the myth began.
</P>
<P>
   They came with flowers in hand and grief in their hearts.
Brushing away rain and tears, they came from down the block. From
across the state. From across the country. From across the globe.
</P>
<P>
   They felt compelled to come to 83 Beals St. Monday _ to the
birthplace and first home of America's forever-young president _ to
mourn the loss of his now forever-young son and namesake, John F.
Kennedy Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never understood the meaning of the word tragedy,'' Shari
Thaler wrote in the condolence book offered Monday by the museum's
National Park Service guides. ``Now I do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched the news and was sad,'' a visitor from Taiwan wrote.
``My thoughts and prayers are with you and your family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I came because JFK Jr. symbolized idealism and hope for me,''
said Dina Gould, a 26-year-old student who drove from Framingham to
add her flowers to the bundles piling up on the porch. ``I've felt
very disappointed in politics, and I thought maybe he might change
that someday.''
</P>
<P>
   His father, President Kennedy, was born in 1917 in the slender
mahogany bed upstairs in the house on Beals Street, just outside
Boston. Camelot began here. In the home is young John F. Kennedy's
copy of ``King Arthur,'' the cover showing a boy discovering his
birthright by pulling a sword out of a stone. Inside is the
inscription from Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, the late matriarch of the
Kennedy clan: ``Jack read this book again and again as a
youngster.''
</P>
<P>
   First a home. Then a museum. And Monday, an impromptu shrine
after Camelot's scion disappeared Friday in the haze over the ocean
off Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievably sad,'' 63-year-old Bernard Slosberg of
Everett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we'd come by today and bring some flowers,'' his
wife, Anne, added, her voice breaking. ``He would have made his
parents very proud.''
</P>
<P>
   The house was scheduled to be closed Monday. But when a Park
Service staffer arrived to complete some paperwork, he found scores
of bouquets, notes, and trinkets left on the porch _ and a line of
mourners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clear what we had to do was open it up,'' said guide
David Kratz. ``There's been a steady stream of visitors all day.''
</P>
<P>
   The lace-curtained home, where Rose Fitzgerald and Joseph P.
Kennedy lived for the first seven years of their marriage, was
repurchased shortly after President Kennedy's assassination in 1963
and restored under Rose's supervision.
</P>
<P>
   In the dining room, alongside the formal table, is a tiny wooden
one, set with two child-sized silver bowls. One engraved with the
initials of President Kennedy's older brother and the family's
first loss, Joseph P. Kennedy Jr., a bomber pilot who died in 1944
on a mission during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The second bowl is Jack's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack said what he liked most about growing up second in the
family was it gave him elbow room to do more of what he liked,''
guide Jeanne Walsh Dumas told visitors Monday. ``Joe Jr. was going
to be the politician, so Jack could imagine doing other things,
like becoming a writer. And if you think about it, that description
might fit his son, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The sense of loss also was evident across town, in a
rain-stained note left on top of a low wall at the entrance to the
JFK Library. ``You are with the angels now, and that gives us some
comfort down here on earth,'' it read.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors placed flowers, cards, candles, and letters along the
library's front wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here because of my love for the Kennedy family,'' said
Karen Duesel of Millbury, who left an arrangement of carnations and
daisies.
</P>
<P>
   The family's tragic history is why Ed Parker brought his
daughter to the library. Parker said his daughter's heart went out
to John F. Kennedy Jr.'s sister, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``I explained to her that it was like if daddy, mommy, and her
little brother died and she was the only one left,'' Parker said
moments after he and 7-year-old Brianna knelt before the wall and
prayed.
</P>
<P>
   For others, though, such explanations were not necessary. A note
addressed to John F. Kennedy Jr. simply read: ``Please give the
flag to your dad.''

 &HT;    Was running coverage too much?
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving in (a) general news and (e) entertainment
categories.)
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ On and on it went. All day Saturday, a good
portion of Sunday and into Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Images of toddler John F. Kennedy Jr. saluting his slain
father's coffin, Kennedy as a hunky bachelor splashing in the surf,
Kennedy as an elegant 35-year-old groom, gallantly kissing his
bride's hand.
</P>
<P>
   It was emotional overkill and wretched excess, but millions of
Americans were glued to their televisions throughout the weekend as
the search for Kennedy's missing plane dragged on. There was little
news to report Saturday morning when the daylong live coverage
began, so cable news networks and the Big Three filled time with
archival footage of Camelot and interviews with historians and a
handful of Kennedy associates.
</P>
<P>
   Within moments of going on the air, the networks had given the
dark day titles such as ``A Nation Waits'' and ``Lost at Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS's Dan Rather was the first of the Big Three anchors on the
air Saturday at 8 a.m., but by the end of the evening news, the day
had taken its toll. Choking back tears, Rather ended his coverage
quoting lines from the song ``Camelot'' and proclaiming anyone
would be ``proud to call him son.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC let its cable outlet, MSNBC, handle coverage while NBC
continued with its Saturday morning teen shows. Eventually, Brian
Williams anchored NBC's coverage and, for a relatively short time
Saturday, Tom Brokaw took over.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's Peter Jennings took the reins from Elizabeth Vargas around
noon and shared the helm with Barbara Walters, who had interviewed
Kennedy a couple of years ago and apparently is friendly with Ethel
Kennedy. Walters described spending several July Fourth holidays
with Ethel and daughter Rory, who is the same age as Walters'
daughter, at Hyannis Port.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone with insider information, CBS' ``60 Minutes,''
which usually eschews breaking news, devoted its entire broadcast
to the latest Kennedy tragedy. The showcased segment was an
interview by Mike Wallace with Christiane Amanpour, CNN
correspondent and occasional ``60 Minutes'' contributor, who shared
a house with JFK Jr. when both attended college in Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   The three networks each had specials on Saturday night and
turned over their Sunday newsmagazines to the topic.
</P>
<P>
   Was it too much?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, because there are just so many of us in the media and so
few stories to cover,'' said CNN media analyst Jeff Greenfield.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Rooney concurred on camera in his ``60 Minutes'' piece but
added that he thought the coverage was ``probably justified''
because the public seems so emotionally invested in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really wasn't much discussion about how we would do
it,'' said ABC News spokeswoman Eileen Murphy. ``There was a search
effort ongoing, and when it involves someone as prominent as John
Kennedy, it's the natural thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Tidbits of news trickled out over the weekend. Reports of plane
debris were the first ominous confirmations that the missing plane
had indeed crashed. Prematurely, news reporters referred to
Kennedy, his wife and sister-in-law in the past tense through much
of Saturday. Not until late Sunday, however, was the Coast Guard
conceding that the mission had changed from rescue to recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Although JFK Jr. was the son of an assassinated president, he
was a private citizen. Any other celebrity of that caliber would
have merited updates rather than wall-to-wall coverage. But the
Kennedys are special. In many ways, the weekend's coverage
resembled the teary stories that accompanied Princess Diana's fatal
car crash. Both victims were young, glamorous and tragic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is undeniably a big story,'' said CBS News spokeswoman
Sandy Genelius. ``So far at least, it's a sad and tragic story.
Editorially, you try to determine how big a story it is, and I
think many people would agree that this one warranted the coverage
it got. I do think the Kennedy family has a unique place in the
psyche of most Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS, ABC and NBC ditched pro sports for the live coverage, and
all said they got few complaints.

 &HT;    Was running coverage too much?
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving in (a) general news and (e) entertainment
categories.)
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ On and on it went. All day Saturday, a good
portion of Sunday and into Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Images of toddler John F. Kennedy Jr. saluting his slain
father's coffin, Kennedy as a hunky bachelor splashing in the surf,
Kennedy as an elegant 35-year-old groom, gallantly kissing his
bride's hand.
</P>
<P>
   It was emotional overkill and wretched excess, but millions of
Americans were glued to their televisions throughout the weekend as
the search for Kennedy's missing plane dragged on. There was little
news to report Saturday morning when the daylong live coverage
began, so cable news networks and the Big Three filled time with
archival footage of Camelot and interviews with historians and a
handful of Kennedy associates.
</P>
<P>
   Within moments of going on the air, the networks had given the
dark day titles such as ``A Nation Waits'' and ``Lost at Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS's Dan Rather was the first of the Big Three anchors on the
air Saturday at 8 a.m., but by the end of the evening news, the day
had taken its toll. Choking back tears, Rather ended his coverage
quoting lines from the song ``Camelot'' and proclaiming anyone
would be ``proud to call him son.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC let its cable outlet, MSNBC, handle coverage while NBC
continued with its Saturday morning teen shows. Eventually, Brian
Williams anchored NBC's coverage and, for a relatively short time
Saturday, Tom Brokaw took over.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's Peter Jennings took the reins from Elizabeth Vargas around
noon and shared the helm with Barbara Walters, who had interviewed
Kennedy a couple of years ago and apparently is friendly with Ethel
Kennedy. Walters described spending several July Fourth holidays
with Ethel and daughter Rory, who is the same age as Walters'
daughter, at Hyannis Port.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone with insider information, CBS' ``60 Minutes,''
which usually eschews breaking news, devoted its entire broadcast
to the latest Kennedy tragedy. The showcased segment was an
interview by Mike Wallace with Christiane Amanpour, CNN
correspondent and occasional ``60 Minutes'' contributor, who shared
a house with JFK Jr. when both attended college in Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   The three networks each had specials on Saturday night and
turned over their Sunday newsmagazines to the topic.
</P>
<P>
   Was it too much?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, because there are just so many of us in the media and so
few stories to cover,'' said CNN media analyst Jeff Greenfield.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Rooney concurred on camera in his ``60 Minutes'' piece but
added that he thought the coverage was ``probably justified''
because the public seems so emotionally invested in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really wasn't much discussion about how we would do
it,'' said ABC News spokeswoman Eileen Murphy. ``There was a search
effort ongoing, and when it involves someone as prominent as John
Kennedy, it's the natural thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Tidbits of news trickled out over the weekend. Reports of plane
debris were the first ominous confirmations that the missing plane
had indeed crashed. Prematurely, news reporters referred to
Kennedy, his wife and sister-in-law in the past tense through much
of Saturday. Not until late Sunday, however, was the Coast Guard
conceding that the mission had changed from rescue to recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Although JFK Jr. was the son of an assassinated president, he
was a private citizen. Any other celebrity of that caliber would
have merited updates rather than wall-to-wall coverage. But the
Kennedys are special. In many ways, the weekend's coverage
resembled the teary stories that accompanied Princess Diana's fatal
car crash. Both victims were young, glamorous and tragic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is undeniably a big story,'' said CBS News spokeswoman
Sandy Genelius. ``So far at least, it's a sad and tragic story.
Editorially, you try to determine how big a story it is, and I
think many people would agree that this one warranted the coverage
it got. I do think the Kennedy family has a unique place in the
psyche of most Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS, ABC and NBC ditched pro sports for the live coverage, and
all said they got few complaints.

 TAKING STOCK OF YOUR BROKER  &HT;     By ARTHUR M. LOUIS 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
With all the publicity these days about online trading, it is easy
to forget that the great majority of investors still buy and sell
securities the old-fashioned way _ through full-service brokers.
<P>
   Much of the time that can be a blessing because it allows
investors to draw on the knowledge and resources of the brokerage
firm's research department and to bounce investment ideas off an
account executive.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes it can be a curse. While the ``vast majority'' of
brokers are ``very honest,'' some take advantage of their position
of authority and superior knowledge to defraud gullible novices,
warns Nancy Smith, head of investor education and assistance with
the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more notable broker fraud cases in the Bay Area in
recent years involved a former broker in the Hayward branch of Dean
Witter. The SEC accused Michael J. Oberholzer of defrauding four
elderly female customers from 1989 to 1995, causing them to lose
hundreds of thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   In a formal complaint, the SEC alleged that Oberholzer traded
securities ``excessively'' in accounts held by the four women to
generate commissions for himself _ a practice known as churning.
The securities in the accounts were turned over an average of three
or four times annually, says John Yun, an SEC lawyer in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   (Turnover of four times annually would mean that the average
holding remained in the account for only three months.)
</P>
<P>
   The SEC also said Oberholzer increased the sizes of the
transactions by trading the accounts on margin _ that is, using
borrowed money. Trading on margin is a high-risk practice,
inappropriate for most investors, that can cause extra-large losses
when a stock falls.
</P>
<P>
   And he allegedly bought and sold ``risky securities that were
not suitable for the customers,'' including volatile,
low-capitalization, over-the-counter stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Betz, 85, of Hayward, Calif., a retired registered nurse
and one of the investors identified by the SEC, recalls that
Oberholzer approached her after she collected the proceeds from the
sale of a house she had inherited from her sister in 1987 and asked
for her business. ``He said the real-estate people, when I made the
sale, reported it to him,'' Betz says.
</P>
<P>
   She says she invested about $200,000 with Oberholzer and lost
about $64,000 of it over six years. She says one of the other women
in the case, her friend Pearl Huey, 82, now disabled with a stroke
and living in a nursing home, also invested $200,000 _ and lost it
all.
</P>
<P>
   When she recalls her ordeal, Betz says, ``All I want to do is
find a rock and crawl under it.''
</P>
<P>
   While neither admitting nor denying the allegations, Oberholzer
agreed in 1997 to a settlement that barred him from the securities
business.
</P>
<P>
   He could not be reached for comment for this article.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Whaley, a Sacramento, Calif., lawyer who represented the
four women, says there is always a temptation for brokers to churn
customer accounts, because ``They can't make enough money if their
clients follow the adage that you are supposed to buy good stocks
and hold them for 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oberholzer case underscores the gravest mistake that
unsophisticated investors can make when they open a brokerage
account.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how little you know about investing, you should never
give a broker the authority to trade for your account without
consulting you.
</P>
<P>
   The women did not give Oberholzer written authority to do this,
says Karen Wellman, a lawyer with the SEC's enforcement division in
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it was understood that he would handle the trading in
their accounts,'' she adds. ``He started trading, and they thought
that was the way it was supposed to work. We would call it de facto
authorization.''
</P>
<P>
   The SEC's Smith says that ``When people who know little or
nothing about investing throw up their hands and say `I'll leave it
to you,' that's usually a recipe for disaster. The more passive you
are about your investments, the greater the likelihood that
something bad will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But if you are ignorant about investing and a broker proposes a
specific investment, how do you respond?
</P>
<P>
   Your best hope, the authorities say, is to ask good questions _
lots of them.
</P>
<P>
   The North American Securities Administrators Association,
composed of securities regulators from all the states, advises you
to take notes whenever you talk to your broker about specific
investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need a good paper trail if you end up in a dispute,'' says
Marc Beauchamp, a securities association spokesman. ``You need to
have good evidence about what happened, not just a vague memory.''
</P>
<P>
   If you consider yourself too clueless to ask the right
questions, the SEC can provide you with a plausible script. It has
produced a brochure containing dozens of questions that cover a
broad variety of investment contingencies.
</P>
<P>
   You can get a copy by calling (800) 732-0330, or you can find it
on the SEC Web site at www.sec.gov.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of BROKERS2 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The most important question of all: ``Does this investment match
my financial goals?''
</P>
<P>
   If your broker can demonstrate that it does, then chances are
you are on reasonably safe ground.
</P>
<P>
   Your broker should be able to answer that question accurately,
because when you open a brokerage account you complete a form that
includes detailed information about your financial position and
goals.
</P>
<P>
   The broker must ask whether you are seeking mainly growth or
current income, how much money you can afford to keep tied up in
securities and for how long, and how much risk you are willing to
tolerate.
</P>
<P>
   Those questions help protect honest brokers as well as
customers, because it is a violation of securities regulations to
recommend an investment that clearly clashes with a customer's
investment goals.
</P>
<P>
   But what if you ask your broker the right questions and the
broker lies?
</P>
<P>
   That evidently happened to thousands of customers of Pruco
Securities, the brokerage unit of Prudential Insurance. The firm
agreed this month to pay $20 million to settle National Association
of Securities Dealers claims that it misrepresented the nature of
200,000 variable life insurance policies it sold from 1983 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   According to a long list of allegations by the NASD, Pruco
represented variable life as an investment, retirement or savings
plan, rather than insurance, and sold it to people who specifically
said they did not want to buy insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Variable life is indeed life insurance, although it includes an
investment component. The ultimate size of the life-insurance
payment to beneficiaries is not fixed; it hinges on the performance
of underlying investments _ such as mutual funds _ selected by the
policyholder.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential accepted the NASD settlement without admitting or
denying guilt _ standard procedure in financial-service
settlements.
</P>
<P>
   However, Prudential spokesman Bob DeFillippo points out that the
case was an offshoot of a much larger case brought by a multistate
task force and settled for billions of dollars. In that case,
``Prudential accepted the findings,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   You may be able to reduce your risk of falling into the clutches
of a scam artist if you check a prospective broker's credentials
before opening an account.
</P>
<P>
   The NASD can help you with this. It maintains a database _
called the Central Registration Depository _ detailing the
professional histories of the more than 500,000 registered brokers
employed by its member firms.
</P>
<P>
   CRD lets you see information about a broker's educational
background and find out where the broker has worked before. Most
important, you can learn whether the broker has been disciplined
for shady practices.
</P>
<P>
   You can apply for a CRD report on a particular broker by
telephoning (800) 289-9999, or by filling out a form on the
Internet at the NASD Web site _ www.nasdr.com. The report will be
mailed to you.
</P>
<P>
   If you think a broker has taken advantage of you, you can file a
complaint with the SEC, NASD or California Department of
Corporations, which regulates the securities business in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC recommends that you refrain from sending it a complaint
until you exhaust your other options. Complain first to the broker
itself, the NASD and the state Department of Corporations, the
agency urges.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the SEC takes your case, you should try initially for a
quick fix because the SEC route can be a long, laborious _ and
possibly fruitless _ process.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC warns that it takes 30 days for it to merely ``analyze''
a complaint. The agency will then send a copy of the complaint to
the broker, asking for a response. This step could take four to six
weeks more.
</P>
<P>
   However, a letter from the SEC often is enough to spur a broker
into resolving a case.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Rose, a San Francisco voice instructor who complained to the
SEC that some stock and cash appeared to be missing from his
accounts with Smith Barney, claims that he had trouble getting
cooperation from the brokerage firm until the SEC wrote it a
letter.
</P>
<P>
   After that, he says, ``One of the Smith Barney lawyers phoned me
and expressed their desire to settle everything.'' Most notably,
the firm agreed to add to his account some shares of AT&AMP;T stock
that Rose contended he had purchased, but which had not shown up on
his monthly statements.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Godfrey, operations manager of the branch where Rose had
his accounts _ he has since switched to another firm _ said the
AT&AMP;T matter was ``apparently a misunderstanding about whether the
order was placed or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Godfrey insists that Smith Barney responded promptly to Rose's
complaints even before getting the notice from the SEC. ``Any time
that Mr. Rose wanted to talk to anyone in the office, we did
respond to him. He spoke to either his broker or a member of
management.''
</P>
<P>
   The SEC can't always be counted on to work wonders. If writing a
letter to a broker does not settle matters, the SEC will take an
average of three or four months to reach a conclusion about your
case _ and the conclusion very likely will be that the agency can't
help you.
</P>
<P>
   Unless your broker clearly violated securities laws or
regulations, the SEC will suggest that you deal with the matter
yourself, by hiring a lawyer and going to arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   If you need help finding a lawyer who handles securities
arbitration, you can contact the Public Investors Arbitration Bar
Association. Address: 1111 Wyline Road, No. 18, Norman, OK 73069.
Telephone: (888) 621-7484 or (405) 360-8776.

 BROKER DO'S AND DON'TS  &HT;     By ARTHUR M. LOUIS 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Investors can take steps to prevent rogue brokers from victimizing
them. And if they are victimized, there are government and private
agencies that will help them try to get their money back and bring
the malefactors to justice.
<P>
   However, after-the-fact remedies are far from certain.
</P>
<P>
   The safest course is prevention: You should educate yourself
about the bad things unscrupulous brokers do to their customers.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Securities Dealers, a private
regulatory body whose membership includes the vast majority of U.S.
brokers, has compiled a long list of practices that are prohibited
in the securities industry. The highlights:
</P>
<P>
   _ Recommending purchase of a security that is unsuitable for a
customer's age, financial position, investment objective or
investment experience.
</P>
<P>
   _ Purchasing or selling securities in a customer's account
without the customer's permission.
</P>
<P>
   _ Switching a customer from one security to another when there
is no legitimate investment purpose.
</P>
<P>
   _ Misrepresenting or failing to disclose material facts
concerning an investment, such as the risks, the fees and the
company's financial results.
</P>
<P>
   _ Removing funds or securities from a customer's account without
the customer's permission.
</P>
<P>
   _ Guaranteeing customers that they will not lose money on a
particular securities transaction.
</P>
<P>
   _ Making specific price predictions concerning an investment.

<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ Abandoning a long tradition of picking its
leaders from within its own ranks, Hewlett-Packard announced Monday
that it had chosen as its next chief executive a woman who earned
her power and reputation in the telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
   Carleton (Carly) S. Fiorina, the 44-year-old president of Lucent
Technologies' global service provider business, will become
president and chief executive of the world's second-largest
computer maker at the end of this year after the retirement of
Lewis E. Platt, who currently serves as chief executive with the
title of chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The company said that Richard A. Hackborn, 60, a board member
who once led Hewlett-Packard's laser printing business, would
become nonexecutive chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous decision by the board to choose a woman with an
undergraduate degree in medieval history and philosophy to head
Silicon Valley's pioneering technology company was widely hailed as
a step for gender equality in an industry that is still largely
dominated by men.
</P>
<P>
   However, Ms. Fiorina, who now heads a $20 billion division of
Lucent, is already widely regarded as the highest ranking woman
among U.S. executives. And on Monday she sought to play down the
issue of gender in her new role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that we are at a point that everyone has figured out
that there is not a glass ceiling,'' she said in response to a
reporter's question. ``My gender is interesting but really not the
subject of the story here.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, industry analysts said Ms. Fiorina's
appointment was a clear statement by a computer maker always been
known for its less-than-glitzy engineering culture that marketing
and sales were taking a front seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has a $50 billion company that she will be trying to
inject a dose of marketing into,'' said Laura Conigliaro, a Wall
Street analyst at Goldman Sachs. ``Nothing is broken at H-P, but
the company needs to be re-energized, and that is her biggest
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fiorina said a top priority would be finding ways to bring
technologies out of the company's research laboratories more
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Several consultants who have worked with the company said it had
developed a number of technologies in network switching, electronic
imaging and display devices that have yet to be turned into
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while the company has been intent on breaking itself up
under Platt's leadership, it has not found new businesses to
insulate it from the computer wars, which are increasingly
stripping away profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, the toughest challenge facing Ms. Fiorina may be
in grappling with difficult technology decisions, given her
background in sales and management.
</P>
<P>
   In introducing Ms. Fiorina on Monday, Platt noted that the
company had conducted a broad search for his successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carly was quite simply the best person to lead H-P into the
next century,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many people familiar with the company had believed that the
insider most likely to be named as Platt's successor would be Ann
M. Livermore, a 40-year-old Hewlett-Packard veteran who heads the
company's $15 billion enterprise computer systems business.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Livermore, a rapidly rising star at the company, is
responsible for its new effort to become a player in the Internet
applications software business, which is booming as commerce
increasingly moves on line.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I was somewhat surprised that they chose an outsider,'' said
Judith Hurwitz, president of the Hurwitz Group, a computer industry
consulting firm. ``What Carly represents is that she was
responsible for the fastest growing part of Lucent.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it is Ms. Fiorina's track record as both a super
saleswoman and a savvy manager who rose to power in the spinoff of
Lucent from AT&AMP;T that brought her to the attention of
Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very bright, and she knows telecommunications very
well,'' said Michael Arellano, president of Degas Communications
Group, a New York consulting firm. She also has managerial and
deal-making savvy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As AT&AMP;T's head of corporate operations when Bell Laboratories
was spun off, she oversaw most elements of the very successful
launch of Lucent.
</P>
<P>
   It was Ms. Fiorina who disposed of the high-volume and
low-profit consumer electronics business that Lucent inherited, by
selling it to Philips.
</P>
<P>
   As head of Lucent's largest business unit, she deals directly
with the company's largest customers. That fact proved irresistible
for Hewlett-Packard; Platt said the company had targeted the
telecommunications industry, which is expected to grow to more than
$650 billion by 2001, as one of its biggest growth opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Just as impressive was her success in accelerating Lucent's
growth outside of the United States from 8 percent to more than 60
percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   The global communications market is fiercely competitive, and
Lucent is in an epic struggle with other global players like
Northern Telecom of Canada, Alcatel of France, Siemens of Germany
and Ericsson of Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the telecommunications business is being turned inside
out by the rise of the Internet, which has led to a rapid shift
away from traditional circuit-switching technologies toward
Internet packet switching.
</P>
<P>
   ``She understands both philosophies well, and H-P is going to
take advantage of her experience,'' Arellano said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, both Platt and Ms. Fiorina said that one of her first
duties would be helping the computer maker complete the spin-off of
its measurement business.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fiorina said her larger goal was to help the company find a
way to keep its legendary core values _ which she referred to as
Hewlett-Packard's ``soul'' _ while at the same time increasing the
company's execution speed and adding a new sense of urgency to its
business mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that we do not have sufficient focus on speed, and
a sense of urgency needs to be reinvigorated,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The more pressing question is likely to be how well Ms.
Fiorina's experience in the telecommunications world will translate
to the computer industry, which is now locked in a vicious cycle of
price cutting.
</P>
<P>
   What no one questioned on Monday were Ms. Fiorina's leadership
skills. Several executives who have watched her career said Monday
that the only surprise was that she was named to head
Hewlett-Packard and not Lucent.
</P>
<P>
   `I remember seeing her speak and thinking, `We're probably
looking at the future CEO of Lucent,''' said Ken Landoline, a
former Lucent employee who is now a market research executive.
</P>
<P>
   Popular wisdom in the industry is that Richard A. McGinn,
Lucent's 52-year-old chief executive, is unlikely to leave that
post anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Her drive and her success in a male-oriented technology world
are particularly unusual in light of the fact that Ms. Fiorina's
career was not a traditional one. She was born in Austin, Texas,
but later lived in the San Francisco Bay area and attended high
school in Palo Alto, where she graduated from Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   She started law school at the University of California at Los
Angeles but then dropped out. After trying various jobs, she says
she joined AT&AMP;T as a sales representative with no firm plans to
stay permanently. Nineteen years later, she is preparing to leave
Lucent not just as a top executive but arguably as the most
powerful woman among American executives.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview on Monday, Ms. Fiorina said she was
planning to move to Silicon Valley with her husband, David, who is
a retired AT&AMP;T executive and is involved in volunteer activities.  &QL;

 CALCULATING GAINS ON STOCK  &HT;     By ARTHUR M. LOUIS 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Q: I was a shareholder of AirTouch Communications until it merged
last month with Vodafone. I received $9 in cash and 0.5 shares of
Vodafone _ $98.50 worth _ for each of my AirTouch shares. The
company said the cash is taxable as a capital gain. But how do I
calculate my cost basis on the Vodafone stock in case I ever decide
to sell it? My cost basis on the AirTouch shares was $58 per share.
<P>
   A: I'll answer this question at the risk of boring people who
never owned any AirTouch shares, because they can share in the
moral of the story: When in doubt about your tax status after a
merger, ask the company's investor relations department for a full
explanation. Don't let them off the telephone until you understand
perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   According to Vodafone, you should simply take the total amount
you spent on AirTouch stock and divide it by the number of Vodafone
shares you received. That will be your per-share cost basis for the
Vodafone stock. That method holds true for any AirTouch shareholder
who paid less than $98.50 per share for their AirTouch stock.
Anyone who paid $98.50 or more per AirTouch share will have to use
a different _ and more complicated _ method to calculate their tax
liability.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you paid $100 per share for AirTouch, you
subtract that amount from the $107.50 worth of stock and cash you
received, which gives you $7.50. You pay an immediate capital-gains
tax on that amount times the number of AirTouch shares you owned.
You then reduce the cash basis on your original purchase by $1.50
per AirTouch share (calculated by subtracting $7.50 from $9). Then
you divide the result by the number of Vodafone shares you received
to get your new per-share cost basis.
</P>
<P>
   Hang in there; we're almost finished.
</P>
<P>
   If you paid $107.50 or more per AirTouch share _ very few people
did, the company tells me _ then the $9-per-share cash payment you
received in the merger is considered a return of capital, and is
entirely nontaxable. However, you must reduce the cost basis of
your AirTouch shares by $9 per share before figuring your Vodafone
cost basis. You then make the usual calculation, dividing by the
number of Vodafone shares.
</P>
<P>
   Stock Wash Sales
</P>
<P>
   Q: You recently answered a question about wash sales of stock,
but I would like to ask another. I know that if I sell a stock at a
loss and then buy back the shares before 30 days have elapsed, it's
considered a wash sale and I can't immediately claim the capital
loss on my income taxes. But what if I buy more stock first, then
sell my other shares at a loss within 30 days?
</P>
<P>
   A: You deserve credit for hatching a clever scheme _ but the tax
man has anticipated you. The 30-day rule extends in both
directions. Purchases of a stock within 30 days before or after the
same stock is sold at a loss will force you to postpone the use of
the loss to offset capital gains on your tax form.
</P>
<P>
   You won't be allowed to use the loss for tax purposes until you
sell the shares you bought back. At that point, you are permitted
to add the amount of the loss to the cost basis of the bought-back
shares, thus reducing your tax liability.
</P>
<P>
   Limits on IRAs
</P>
<P>
   Q: You recently stated that someone who has both a Roth
Individual Retirement Account and a traditional IRA cannot
contribute a total of more than $2,000 to both of them in any given
year. What if you have a Roth IRA and a SEP IRA _ as I do? Aren't
the rules more liberal in that case?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. The combined $2,000 limit doesn't apply to you because a
SEP _ short for Simplified Employee Pension Plan _ isn't considered
a traditional IRA. You still are limited to a maximum annual
contribution of $2,000 to your Roth, but in addition you may be
able to contribute up to $6,000 to your SEP IRA.
</P>
<P>
   The SEP program was created by Congress to encourage small
businesses to offer pension benefits. The more generous
contribution limit is an incentive for employees to participate.
</P>
<P>
   While it isn't relevant to your particular case, Internal
Revenue Service spokesman Jesse Weller cautions people who have
traditional, deductible IRAs that participation in a SEP plan
conceivably could bar them from deducting their IRA contributions
from taxable income.
</P>
<P>
   He notes that people who participate in any kind of
employer-sponsored pension plans can claim deductions for
traditional IRAs only if their incomes are below certain levels.
</P>
<P>
   For a husband and wife who are both covered by
employer-sponsored plans, the $2,000 IRA deduction begins phasing
out if total income exceeds $51,000, and is eliminated completely
if income is at least $61,000. For single persons covered by
employer plans, the phaseout begins with $31,000 of income and the
deduction disappears completely with $41,000 of income or more.
</P>
<P>
   However, the limit is much higher for married couples if one of
the spouses is not covered by an employer-sponsored pension plan.
In that case, the phaseout of the $2,000 deduction occurs between
$150,000 and $160,000 of income.

 BOURNE, Mass.: feet square.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The state police divers from the Underwater Recovery Unit worked
from sonar maps that have been color-coded to show objects with
90-degree angles, indicating possible manmade objects.
</P>
<P>
   The divers, who are working in seas that are about 80 feet deep,
have nine more promising spots, which they call ``targets of
opportunity,'' that investigators have identified on sonar maps.
Debris is being taken to a hangar here, where NTSB investigators
are poring over refueling and maintenance records for Kennedy's
plane. Investigators said they also are interviewing people who saw
the plane depart New Jersey, and pilots and flight instructors who
flew with Kennedy and might be able to provide background
information.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy had suffered a sports injury shortly before his death.
The Toronto Star reported Monday that Keith Stein, vice president
for corporate affairs of Magna International Inc., an auto parts
company in Aurora, Ontario, said that when Kennedy flew in on July
12 to discuss investment in George magazine, he brought along a
flight instructor.
</P>
<P>
   ``John indicated he wasn't comfortable flying by himself with a
broken foot,'' The Star quoted Stein as saying. ``He mentioned
something about needing help with the pedals.''
</P>
<P>
   Rear Adm. Richard Larrabee of the Coast Guard, who had
maintained publicly that searchers were looking for survivors long
past the time experts expected they could have lived in the chilly
ocean, showed a similar optimism Monday about the search, pointing
to the sophisticated equipment that had arrived Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A Coast Guard spokesman, Cmdr. Mike Lapinski, said he had
received several news media inquiries about the size of the search.
He said it was on the same scale as many others the Coast Guard
performs each year that receive little public notice, and added
that it was ``necessary and appropriate given the uncertainty and
the size of the search area.''
</P>
<P>
   In its statement, the Bessette family said: ``John and Carolyn
were true soulmates, and we hope to honor them in death in the
simple manner in which they chose to live their lives. We take
solace in the thought that together they comfort Lauren for
eternity.''
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference, President Clinton said he believed the
search should continue. ``John Kennedy and his sister and later his
wife were uncommonly kind to my daughter and my wife,'' he said.
``This has been a very difficult thing for us personally, as well
as because of my position. They are very strong people, and I think
they're carrying on as well as any human beings could, but they
need the support and prayers of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Ehud Barak, the new Israeli prime minister, appearing with
Clinton, called the deaths a ``tragedy that I believe touched
hearts of billions all around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy did not obtain his pilot's license until April 1998. He
said he had been fascinated by flight since childhood. In an
interview in 1995, replayed Monday on the ABC talk show ``The
View,'' Barbara Walters asked if he once had wanted to be an
astronaut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I did _ helicopter pilot, astronaut, something in the
air,'' he said. ``Growing up, there were always helicopters landing
on the front lawn of the White House, and usually one parent or
another would emerge from them, so I kind of got this thing about
helicopters.'' Asked when that changed, he laughed and said, ``I'm
not sure it's changed.''

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane dived toward the ocean far
faster than previously thought, plummeting at a dangerous rate that
must have caused a locomotive-like roar of wind in the cockpit,
investigators and aeronautics authorities said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, Federal Aviation Administration officials confirmed
they were alerted that Kennedy's plane had not arrived at Martha's
Vineyard Airport more than four hours before a call from a Kennedy
family friend triggered the search. They said they took no action
because the call failed to raise ``warning flags.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's search efforts ended with no new sign of the plane or
the bodies of Kennedy, his wife Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, or her
sister, Lauren Bessette. Massachusetts State Police divers reached
a single potential ``target'' off Martha's Vineyard that turned out
to be a rock shaped like a plane's fuselage. A sophisticated Navy
ship built for underwater search and retrieval operations was
scheduled to join the effort Tuesday, and at least nine other
target sites had been identified.
</P>
<P>
   At the Kennedy compound at Hyannis Port, where John and Carolyn
Bessette Kennedy were headed for the wedding of his cousin, Rory
Kennedy, an American flag was lowered to half-staff. Also Monday,
the victims' families released their first public statements on the
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are filled with unspeakable grief and sadness by the loss
of John and Carolyn, and of Lauren Bessette,'' said a statement by
Senator Edward M. Kennedy. ``John was a shining light in all our
lives, and in the lives of the nation and the world that first came
to know him when he was a little boy.''
</P>
<P>
   The parents of Lauren Bessette and Carolyn Bessette Kennedy
said, in part, ``John and Carolyn were true soul mates and we hope
to honor them in death in the simple manner in which they chose to
live their lives. We take solace in the thought that together they
will comfort Lauren for eternity.''
</P>
<P>
   The new information about the plane's rate of descent cast a
dark light on the flight's final moments Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   In the last sightings recorded by radar, Kennedy's Piper
Saratoga II HP was heading downward at 4,700 feet per minute _
roughly eight times what experienced pilots said was the normal
rate of descent for the single-engine airplane.
</P>
<P>
   The plane dropped from an altitude of 2,200 feet to 1,100 feet
in only 14 seconds, said Robert Pearce, a regional director for the
National Transportation Safety Board who is heading the
investigation. Pearce refused to characterize the effects of such a
rapid descent, but aeronatics authorities and pilots said
catastrophe was all but certain unless Kennedy took immediate,
decisive counter-action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not categorize it as a full-over dive, but you are in
serious trouble and need to take corrective action in a hurry or it
is all over. And at 1,100 feet, you don't have any room to make
mistakes,'' said a highly placed federal aviation source familiar
with the investigation. ``Everyone is speculating that he was in a
spin, but that is just speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   While some pilots are known to become so disoriented when flying
in difficult conditions that they are not aware that the plane is
losing alititude, banking, or even flying upside down, the source
said the plane was traveling so quickly the air sounds would have
given them a terrible warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were aware they were going down,'' the official said.
``With that kind of descent rate, it is going to be noisier than
hell in the cockpit.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the plane's manufacturer, New Piper Aircraft
Inc., said the company was reviewing the information provided by
the NTSB to determine what effect such a speedy descent might have
on the Saratoga's frame. She said the company would release a
statement ``in the near future'' but was unable to say when.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Danziger, a pilot who owns the same model plane as
Kennedy, said the normal rate of descent is 500 feet to 700 feet
per minute. ``It is not unsafe to descend at 1,000 feet per minute,
but I don't think the dial goes a heck of a lot farther down than
that,'' Danziger said. In fact, the vertical speed indicator goes
to 2,000 feet per minute; Kennedy was heading downward more than
twice as fast.
</P>
<P>
   Munir Hussein, the New Jersey factory owner who sold Kennedy the
plane in April, said the plane never descended that quickly during
his 200 hours of flying it. ``That's too fast for that plane to
descend,'' Hussein said. ``He would not be able to recover from the
descent that fast.''
</P>
<P>
   In a brief interview, Marvin Wyatt, a controller at the Martha's
Vineyard Airport tower the night of Kennedy's flight, said
visibility was good at the airport at Kennedy's expected arrival
time, but it was poor over the water just off the island. Wyatt
said that would have made it a ``challenging'' flight for a pilot
with Kennedy's experience.
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt declined comment on whether he had any radio contact with
Kennedy's plane. NTSB officials said there was no word from
Kennedy's flight during the last 40 minutes it was known to be in
the air.
</P>
<P>
   The new information about the plane's descent offered at least
one possible explanation of why one of the first parts of the plane
recovered was a piece of the landing gear. The plane may have been
so shattered upon impact that the gear was ripped free from its
housing, aeronautics authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a plane impacts at that speed, the chances are it will
break up,'' said Eugene Covert, professor of aeronautics at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology for more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Another scenario is that Kennedy lowered the landing gear in a
desperate effort to slow his plane. ``It is one of the things
pilots in retractable-gear aircraft do in loss-of-control
situations,'' said Warren Morningstar, a pilot and director of
media relations for the Aircraft Owner and Pilots Association.
``You want to try to increase the drag on the airplane to slow it
down and you can do that by putting out the gear.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, records released by the FAA Monday showed that the
1997 annual inspection of the plane that Kennedy bought last April
uncovered a problem with its propeller control.
</P>
<P>
   A bolt was rubbing against the engine, and if allowed to
continue could cause the propeller to jam, the report said. The
mechanic who inspected the plane said he had found a similar
problem with four other Piper Saratogas he had inspected and
recommended that the company issue a safety bulletin about the
problem or make a design change to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   FAA records show that on several occasions since 1990 Piper
Saratogas or similar models had lost their power or the pilot had
inexplicably lost control of the plane, causing it to crash. The
FAA's thumbnail descriptions of the incidents did not include
causes of the power losses. While no one was killed in the
incident, a Piper Saratoga lost its power while at 7,000 feet while
flying in Alaska in April 1995. The pilot was able to land the
plane on a highway and emerged safe.
</P>
<P>
   Pearce, the NTSB official, said Kennedy's plane underwent an
annual maintenance inspection on June 28. Two weeks later, the
plane underwent additional maintenance, for adjustment of its
magnetic compass, which is used by pilots to set a heading.
</P>
<P>
   Pearce and other NTSB officials said it was premature to
speculate on the cause of the crash. However, information released
Monday appeared to rule out some possible causes, including running
out of fuel. Pearce said the plane was last refueled July 11, when
Kennedy bought 62 gallons, more than enough to make the trip from
Essex County Airport in Fairfield, N.J., to Martha's Vineyard
several times over.
</P>
<P>
   It was not known what quantity of fuel was already in the tanks
when the 62 gallons were added, so it is possible there was even
more fuel on board. The plane has a capacity of 120 gallons.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the engine died, a federal avaiation source said, it is
unlikely that the plane would reach such a high rate of descent,
because the plane is designed to glide without power at a much
slower rate for several miles. And if Kennedy had run out of fuel,
it is likely he would have made a distress call.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's search efforts had something of an anticlimactic feel,
coming just hours after Coast Guard officials said the mission had
changed from searching for survivors to recovering the dead and the
plane wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the focus was on 10 Massachusetts State Police divers
who had been waiting for nearly two days to head into the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a low-stress dive. It's not a kid, it's not a homicide,''
said Trooper William Nasuit, who in 1997 recovered the body of
Jeffrey Curley, the slain Cambridge 10-year-old whose remains were
found in a Maine river.
</P>
<P>
   The divers went out shortly after noon and came back about three
hours later. Coast Guard officials later said the object they were
sent to explore turned to be a 14-foot-long boulder.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors flocked to the JFK memorial in Hyannis Monday, and two
dozen bouquets of flowers were placed on the hedges that encircle a
granite wall bearing the slain president's name.
</P>
<P>
   Someone left a tiny teddy bear, and a note written in crayon in
a child's handwriting said, ``I am going to miss you.'' Above it
was a picture of an airplane drawn in orange crayon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to pay my respects,'' said Daisy Rodriguez, 35, of
Brooklyn, N.Y. Her friend, Teresa Barone, 26, of New Jersey, said,
``JFK Jr. was of our generation. This was the son coming up. We all
hoped that he had great things ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   At the JFK museum on Main Street in Hyannis, more than 550
people walked through the doors Monday. An impromptu exhibit
included photographs of John F. Kennedy Jr. as a boy, including one
in which he holds his father's hand as they walk to a candy store
in Hyannis Port.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked when I saw his picture there,'' said Margie
Conley, 51, of Brooklyn, N.Y. ``It's like a bucket of water hitting
you.''

 FCC CHIEF ASKS HANDS OFF THE INTERNET  &HT;     By DEBORAH SOLOMON 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO -- The federal government must practice ``vigilant
restraint'' when it comes to the regulating the Internet, the
nation's top communications official said Monday.
<P>
   In a meeting with The Chronicle, William Kennard, chairman of
the Federal Communications Commission, said lawmakers need to get
out of the way of companies participating in the Internet economy
or risk curtailing progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is really blossoming, but some policy-makers and
politicians want to control it and regulate access to it,'' Kennard
said. ``We should not try to intervene in this marketplace. We need
to monitor the rollout but recognize we don't have all the answers
because we don't know where we're going.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennard, who was in San Francisco to talk to state utility
regulators from around the country, said that hands-off view should
also apply to high-speed Internet providers, like AT&AMP;T, which are
offering Internet connections over cable TV lines.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T currently is embroiled in a fight with America Online and
other Internet service providers over ``open access.'' AOL wants
local governments to force AT&AMP;T to open its cable network to
competitors so they can provide fast Internet connections over
AT&AMP;T's pipes.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Board of Supervisors plans to vote on open
access next Monday and will consider forcing AT&AMP;T to open its cable
lines to competitors. A recent decision by a federal judge in
Portland gave that city the right to force AT&AMP;T to open its
network.
</P>
<P>
   But Kennard said he does not favor forcing cable companies to
open their pipes to competitors and added that the issue should be
decided on a national, not local, level.
</P>
<P>
   His comments came on the heel of a report issued by FCC staff,
which said the commission's 30-year policy of not regulating data
services has allowed the Internet to flourish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't disagree with the ends that AOL and others want to
achieve, which is openness,'' Kennard said. ``But in this space,
it's very difficult to mandate openness in a regulatory manner.'
</P>
<P>
   Kennard said if the FCC wrote an ordinance forcing cable
companies to open their pipes to competitors, it would be a long,
drawn-out process that would stifle investment and be almost
impossible to enforce.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a difficult, costly undertaking,'' Kennard said.
Instead of regulating the Internet, he said, the FCC should make it
easier for companies to upgrade their pipes so they can offer
high-speed Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``This industry is just getting off the ground and the most
important thing is to get these pipes built fast,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He argued that Wall Street, which is financing the upgrade of
cable lines across the country, will be discouraged by a ruling
that forces open access.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to place a regulatory dark cloud over the
Internet. If we write an ordinance, the people on Wall Street who
were going to finance this deployment won't do it because they
won't know what the rules are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of AOL's main arguments is that consumers won't have a
choice for fast Internet service unless competitors get access to
AT&AMP;T's lines. But Kennard said a whole host of new technologies
will provide consumers with fast ways to access the Net.
</P>
<P>
   He mentioned digital subscriber lines and wireless Internet
access as two alternatives. And he said AOL's recent investment in
satellite technology proves that service providers have other ways
to give consumers fast access.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard added that if it turns out that &UR;  &LR; cable providers are
practicing anticompetitive practices, the government will take
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are tangible, anticompetitive practices, we can and
will step in. But we won't sit here and pretend we have a crystal
ball and can predict what the marketplace will look like,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   While Kennard did not touch on open access during his speech to
the National Association of Regulatory Commissioners, he did
discuss another issue that hits close to home: the proliferation of
area codes.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman said he realizes there is a ``numbering crisis'' in
America and said the FCC would soon provide some relief to states.
</P>
<P>
   One possible solution that Kennard said the FCC might approve is
a technology-specific area code. California has asked the FCC for
the right to assign different area codes to cell phones and pagers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The states need the ability to have flexibility in dealing
with the area code problem,'' Kennard said. He said the FCC will
likely rule on technology-specific area codes by the end of the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is also considering changing the way phone
numbers are assigned _ a measure that would bring much-needed
relief to California and other states dealing with area code
crunches.

STOCKS SLIP A BIT; DOW FALLS 22.16 POINTS, TO 11,187.68 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices staged a modest retreat for the first
time in four sessions Monday, despite a wave of glowing earnings
reports from some of the nation's biggest corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said that a pull-back was to be expected because stocks
have been so strong lately. On Friday, all three major market
averages closed at record highs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is acting extremely well in light of the fact that
the indexes are very close to their all-time highs and there are a
lot of potentially disconcerting situations in places like
Argentina and the dispute between China and Taiwan,'' said Ned
Collins, head stock trader at Daiwa Securities America.
</P>
<P>
   At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 22.16
points, to 11,187.68. Declines in stocks like Coca-Cola, Johnson &AMP;
Johnson and IBM more than offset gains in American Express,
Hewlett-Packard and J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Lucent Technologies fell 1 39/64 a share, to 75 53/64,
after Hewlett-Packard said that a key Lucent executive, Carleton
Fiorina, would become its chief executive at the end of the year;
Hewlett-Packard rose 2\ a share, to 116\.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent's plunge helped to pull down the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index, which lost 11.12 points, to 1,407.66. Weakness
among Internet companies pushed down the Nasdaq composite index. It
fell 34.10 points, or 1.2 percent, closing at 2,830.38.
</P>
<P>
   In large part, stock prices are being sustained by a string of
positive earnings reports. Monday a number of big money center
banks, including Morgan and Citigroup, posted results that
surpassed analyst expectations. Even so, their shares rose only
modestly. Citigroup closed at 49 3/16 a share, up 3/16. Morgan
gained |, to 138.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, airline stocks surged after the parent companies of
a number of carriers, including Delta Air Lines, Continental
Airlines and Alaska Air, posted earnings that beat estimates. The
American Stock Exchange airline index jumped 3.4 percent Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Drug stocks were weak. Pfizer, which posted quarterly results
Monday, fell 11/16 a share, to 37[; Bristol-Myers Squibb lost 1
11/16, to 73\; and Warner-Lambert dropped 1{, to 71}.
</P>
<P>
   After the market closed, two technology bellwethers, Microsoft
and IBM, reported stronger-than-expected profits. This is the
busiest week of the quarterly earnings reporting season, with more
than 1,000 companies scheduled to report. Tuesday's list includes
General Motors, Johnson &AMP; Johnson and Philip Morris, all of which
are Dow components.
</P>
<P>
   Befitting a summer Monday, trading volume was light. On the New
York Stock Exchange, about 640 million shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
   But activity in the initial public offering market remains
brisk. This week roughly 24 companies are expected to raise at
least $2.16 billion in new offerings, according to IPO Reporter, an
industry newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, 246 companies have held initial public
offerings, raising $26.5 billion, Steve Lacey, managing editor of
IPO Reporter, said. ``If the market continues to perform well,
there is every expectation we will come close to setting a record
in terms of dollar volume'' this year, Lacey said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the record year, 872 companies raised $26.5 billion
through initial public offerings.
</P>
<P>
   David Manlow, president of IPO Financial Network, which
publishes a bimonthly newsletter, attributed the strong summer
performance to revived interest in Internet issues.
</P>
<P>
   Of the companies expected to price shares this week, seven are
Internet stocks, Lacey said.

<P>
   As Barnesandnoble.com was preparing to go public in April,
employees talked giddily about their future wealth. Having accepted
stock options as a big chunk of their compensation _ a common
practice among Internet ventures _ many of them dreamed that their
shares would mimic those of companies like Theglobe.com, whose
stock shot up 500 percent on the first day of trading.
</P>
<P>
   People were walking around with calculators trying to estimate
what they would be worth and discussing plans to repay student
loans or buy new apartments, one Barnesandnoble.com insider said.
But after an early jump, the venture's stock actually dove beneath
its initial offering price. Within a month of going public, a half
dozen or so disillusioned staff members had resigned. The stock has
since bounced slightly above its initial price.
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of 1999, many an enterprising soul has
founded an Internet company, offered stock and created a fortune,
sometimes achieving a billion-dollar stock market valuation
seemingly overnight. Everyone from newly minted college graduates
to established professionals like Lou Dobbs, the CNN financial
commentator, who quit to run an outfit called Space.com, seems to
be hurrying to get a piece of the action.
</P>
<P>
   But like any gold rush this one has a lot of seekers who never
hit the mother lode. While statistics are not available for
individuals or even for companies that do not get off the ground,
the venture capitalists that finance start-up companies have a rule
of thumb. For every 10 ventures that receive financing (and plenty
do not), two will be stock market successes, which means
spectacular gains for early investors; three will become part of
other concerns, which can translate into a nice return, and the
rest will fail. That means a lot of Internet entrepreneurs and
their employees who end up disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Even those Internet ventures that have glittering stock
offerings may not be able to sustain those stock prices long enough
for people with stock options to cash out.
</P>
<P>
   Company officers are not allowed to sell their shares for
several months after the offering, and stock options granted
employees may not vest for years even if they can be exercised
below current market price. Right now the market for Web stocks is
sizzling. Of the 126 initial public offerings of Internet stocks
priced this year, 73 are trading above the price they closed on
their first day of trading, according to CommScan, a market
research company in New York. And after 30 days the stocks had
gained an average of 126 percent. Still, 53 of the offerings have
failed to live up to their fabulous first-day billings, and 17 are
below the initial offering price.
</P>
<P>
   Not getting really, really rich should not be news, but during
these heady times it is a violation of expectations. Clay Shirky, a
professor of new media at Hunter College in New York City who
admits to occasional bouts of jealousy about the new riches
himself, argues that people both inside and outside the industry
have developed a distorted view of how easy it is to get wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   Shirky, who, by his own admission, spends numerous hours talking
to industry colleagues about the newest millionaires, said, ``The
perception that about one person in six gets lucky is a fiction.''
It can't be more than one in a thousand, he figures.
</P>
<P>
   For those left behind, even if they have achieved modest
success, it can mean bitterness. What makes it even harder to take
is the apparent randomness of success. After all, nearly all
Internet companies are losing money. So why are a few doing so well
while others languish?
</P>
<P>
   Paul Cohen started a web site called Biztravel.com, for business
people who are always on the road. Thinking he needed big backers
and professional management to make the site into a booming
business, in 1996 Cohen sold a majority stake for ``less than a
million'' to a consortium that included News Corp, Intel, Informix
and Sir Bernard Ashley of Laura Ashley.
</P>
<P>
   The group then invested $20 million, but in Cohen's view, was
not focused on exactly which market it was aiming at. The company
has been through two chief executives since the acquisition and now
the position is vacant. A Biztravel spokeswoman, Mimi Bloom,
confirmed that ``our investors are very open to the possibility of
a sale,'' which is just what agitates Cohen. ``The majority of the
investors are going to lose their stake,'' predicts Cohen, who does
not think the purchase price will equal their investments. ``It
could have been an IPO, a big one,'' he observes.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the new windfall has been toughest on the industry's
pioneers, who simply arrived too soon. Howard Rheingold founded
some of the Internet's best-known and most highly regarded ventures
over the past two decades, including Electric Minds, which Time
magazine named one of the top 10 web sites in 1996. But all his
businesses have since failed, and Rheingold, though comfortable, is
hardly swimming in Internet money. It sometimes gets to him. ``I've
had to meditate on this a lot,'' he admits. ``My goal in life is
not to be a jillionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is disconsolate, of course, but handling real-world
bumps after harboring Trump-sized ambitions can be humbling. Juno
Online Services Inc., a web access and e-mail service, went public
at the end of May at $13, and its stock almost immediately tanked.
The price went as low as $8.875 before rumors of a merger sent it
to the mid-$20s, where it has stayed. ``It is human nature to feel
better when fortunes are doing better than poorly,'' concedes its
president, Charles Ardai, who did not return phone calls until his
stock had climbed past the offering price. ``But we make sure to
remind people it is a volatile industry.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the hardest lessons for would-be Midases to absorb has
been the incredible arbitrariness of the stock market. These days,
starry-eyed start-up owners are also discovering that the same
forces that created blow-out Internet offerings, namely the good
will of the market and day traders, can be very fickle. If the
market suddenly goes cold and a company has already set a date for
going public, there is little it can do but pray.
</P>
<P>
   ``Timing is everything,'' said David Cowan, a partner as
Bessemer Venture Partners, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm,
who recently watched as Flycast, an online advertising firm that he
helped finance, got off to a disappointing start. ``It is
absolutely the case that an IPO's success has a lot more to do with
the IPO market than with the fundamentals of the business.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the market goes sour, even the most glittering success
can lose much of its shine. Two months ago, Dave Kansas, editor of
Thestreet.com, was the talk of the Internet world. When
Thestreet.com, in which the New York Times Co. has invested, went
public in May, its stock price quickly surged from $18 to $60.
Kansas found himself the subject of numerous articles, penned in
amazement that a mere journalist could suddenly be worth $9.1
million. As a company officer, however, Kansas is prohibited from
cashing out until November. In the meantime, he has watched the
value of his stock drop by more than half. ``I joke with friends,
`Hey, I lost a million bucks last week, what did you do?'''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas can joke, of course, because he is still, in theory,
worth millions, but to employees lower down the totem poll a crash
in the stock price can be devastating to dreams. Managers who count
on stock as a motivator have had to learn to punt. Todd Krizelman,
the 25-year-old co-chief executive and co-founder of Theglobe.com,
watched his company's stock rocket from its offering price of 9 to
almost 49 and then settle back to the high teens. On paper he is
worth many millions, but his employees are working on much smaller
margins. ``It was great euphoria when we were going public, the
fact that it had turned us around so quickly has been a
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Krizelman says he does not want employees to be like day
traders, checking the stock price 40 to 50 times a day.
``Ninety-five percent of our employees have stock options,'' said
Krizelman, who sold 5 percent of his holdings in the second
quarter. ``We tell them it is the right bet in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   Marie Toulantis, the chief financial officer for
Barnesandnoble.com, also argues that most of her employees are too
smart to focus on today's stock price. ``I don't think it was
anyone's major reason for leaving,'' she said of the staff
departures. ``Options can take four years to vest; it is not like
cash today.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Internet truism that entrepreneurs are coming to terms
with is that even good ideas with lots of backing do not always
flower into fortunes. Web Flow was one of the first software
companies to offer ``multi-platform'' applications _ programs
compatible with numerous computer types and operating systems _
making it an incredibly promising company in 1995. Bob Arasmith,
its vice president for engineering, remembers that venture
capitalists were vying to back them. ``It was no effort to get
millions,'' he said. The company raised $4 million in December 1995
and $10 million more six months later.
</P>
<P>
   But the marketplace did not take to the concept as quickly as
the venture firms. By the spring of 1998, the company was out of
business, and the board sold it back to its software developers for
pennies on the dollar. Today, Arasmith is president of a company
that makes a similar product and seems circumspect about the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to be profitable, but I don't imagine that we will
sell out for $100 million,'' he said, ``and we don't walk around
looking at Ferrari dealerships like we used to.''

 &HT;    FSU's favored; Jackets No. 2
 &HT;    By Norman Arey and J.C. Clemons
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Greensboro, N.C. _ To the surprise of no one, Florida State was
again picked to finish first in the ACC at the annual ACC Football
Kickoff meetings.
</P>
<P>
   FSU got 84 first-place votes out of 87 ballots cast by
sportswriters and sportscasters covering the two-day event. Georgia
Tech finished second and received the other three first-place votes
while Virginia was third and North Carolina fourth. The rest of the
order: N.C. State, Clemson, Duke, Wake Forest and Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Tech's No. 2 finish is the highest the Jackets have been picked
in the league since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Like father, like son
</P>
<P>
   Although FSU coach Bobby Bowden didn't attend because of a
vacation in Greece, his second son, Tommy Bowden, the new coach at
Clemson, obviously inherited Dad's sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   On FSU's chances this year, he said: ``If he loses, he ought to
be shot with what he's got down there.''
</P>
<P>
   On Clemson's chances for a winning season: ``There's problems
there or I wouldn't be there. Anytime you play Marshall at home
(the Tigers' opener on Sept. 4) and you're an underdog, there's
been a loss of credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   On playing against his father: ``There's a misconception about
him because he speaks at churches that he's not cold-blooded. They
are the most-penalized team in the country year in and year out.
I'm sure that's not New Testament theory.''
</P>
<P>
   On the fact that his dad will be going after win No. 300 this
season: ``I can't fathom winning 300. I've just won 18.''
</P>
<P>
   Gator-style offense
</P>
<P>
   Carl Franks, who spent 19 seasons either playing or coaching
under Florida coach Steve Spurrier, is the new coach at Duke. He
says the folks in Durham will get to see plenty of passing this
season and in the future. ``After playing under (Spurrier) and
coaching with him for so long, our offense at Duke is going to be
very similar to Florida's,'' Franks said.
</P>
<P>
   And, he was asked, will he make all the other coaches in the
league mad like his big-mouthed boss did in the SEC?
</P>
<P>
   ``Did he do that?'' Franks deadpanned.
</P>
<P>
   A new-look preseason at Tech
</P>
<P>
   This preseason will be unlike any coach George O'Leary has had
at Tech as the school moves to a semester system this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Under the quarter system, the football players would be able to
practice nearly a month before classes started.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ours was like a pro camp,'' O'Leary said. ``(Now) installation
(of game plans) will be different.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Tech's classes start Aug. 23, about a month earlier
than in the past. Freshmen report Aug. 7 and varsity players Aug.
10, with the season opener Sept. 4 at Navy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be we'd played four games and the kids hadn't been
to class, yet,'' O'Leary said.Up, up and away
</P>
<P>
   Preparation won't be the only thing different about Tech's
opener. O'Leary will have to coach the Navy game from the press
box, as part of NCAA sanctions for making a loan to a former
player.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be different,'' O'Leary said. ``It changes your staff as
far as who's up and who's down (on the field). We'll just get that
out of the way and move on from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Tech signed Algis Motiejunas, a 6-foot2, 190-pound defensive
back from Glendale (Ariz.) Community College. He is a younger
brother of former Jackets track stars Tomas and Jonas Motiejunas. .
. . FSU assistant coach Chuck Amato on losing two starting
quarterbacks last season: ``In all my years of coaching, losing two
starters in a five-month period, I'd never seen such a thing. But
Chris Weinke is 100 percent now and ready to go.''Norman Arey and
J.C. Clemons write for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Atlanta,
Ga.

shame the rundown town of Blagoveshchensk. ``We send them our

admire his ``courage'' in prosecuting the president. (Justin Lane

day traders, checking the stock price 40 to 50 times a day.
``Ninety-five percent of our employees have stock options,'' said
Mr. Krizelman, who sold 5 percent of his holdings in the second

issues in the Senate so far this year, gun control and new
regulations for managed health care, Fitzgerald, broke party ranks

SIMS RESIGNS AS CHIEF OF CAMBRIDGE TECHNOLOGY PARTNERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Corrects name of Sims' former company.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   James K. Sims, chief executive of Cambridge Technology Partners
Inc. since its founding eight years ago, surprised Wall Street
analysts Monday by announcing his resignation, effective June 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the next few years, the company is going to heavily focus
on operations, while my strengths are on building businesses,
getting them started, working with employees and customers,'' said
the 52-year-old Sims. ``I guess, I saw it was my time to leave. And
I plan on spending August with my family, and my new grandchildren.
In September, I'll look around and start all over again. I think
that's pretty cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Sims the information-technology consulting firm grew to
4,600 employees in 53 offices worldwide, with revenue last year of
$612 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Cambridge, Mass. company said Jack Messman will succeed Sims
on Aug. 1. Messman was chairman and chief executive of Union
Pacific Resources Group Inc., an independent oil and gas
exploration and production company.
</P>
<P>
   Sims said he informed the board of directors several months ago
that he no longer wanted to be chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Cambridge Technology Partners, which challenged the consulting
business by offering fixed-price, fixed-time contracts lasting six
to nine months, grew quickly during most of the 1990s but stumbled
in the last 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   An early user of client-server computing, the company developed
a proprietary library of software that it would tailor to
individual clients. It specializes in bringing users from several
different departments together to build a consensus before creating
and introducing new software. Cambridge Technology Partners became
one of the fastest growing Massachusetts companies during the early
to mid-1990s. It was also among the biggest recruiters for local
software talent on college campuses.
</P>
<P>
   But the pell-mell growth took its toll on the company, which
needed to restructure operations last year, revamp its sales force
and focus on achieving new levels of growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company probably needs a management team with a different
skill set now, '' said Brian Maimone, director and senior analyst
at ING Barings Ltd., a New York investment and brokerage firm.
``All the raw materials, from its assets to its methodologies are
there, it just has to be reorganized in a different way.''
</P>
<P>
   Maimone said the appointment of Messman, who does not come from
the consulting industry ``is a real question mark.''
</P>
<P>
   Sims's announcement had little effect on the company's stock,
which has fallen steeply from its 52-week high of 55 1/2 last July.
It closed Monday at 19 15/16, down 5/16 on the Nasdaq exchange.

BOURNE, Mass.: feet square.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The state police divers from the Underwater Recovery Unit worked
from sonar maps that have been color-coded to show objects with
90-degree angles, indicating possible manmade objects.
</P>
<P>
   The divers, who are working in seas that are about 80 feet deep,
have nine more promising spots, which they call ``targets of
opportunity,'' that investigators have identified on sonar maps.
Debris is being taken to a hangar here, where NTSB investigators
are poring over refueling and maintenance records for Kennedy's
plane. Investigators said they also are interviewing people who saw
the plane depart New Jersey, and pilots and flight instructors who
flew with Kennedy and might be able to provide background
information.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy had suffered a sports injury shortly before his death.
The Toronto Star reported Monday that Keith Stein, vice president
for corporate affairs of Magna International Inc., an auto parts
company in Aurora, Ontario, said that when Kennedy flew in on July
12 to discuss investment in George magazine, he brought along a
flight instructor.
</P>
<P>
   ``John indicated he wasn't comfortable flying by himself with a
broken foot,'' The Star quoted Stein as saying. ``He mentioned
something about needing help with the pedals.''
</P>
<P>
   Rear Adm. Richard Larrabee of the Coast Guard, who had
maintained publicly that searchers were looking for survivors long
past the time experts expected they could have lived in the chilly
ocean, showed a similar optimism Monday about the search, pointing
to the sophisticated equipment that had arrived Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A Coast Guard spokesman, Cmdr. Mike Lapinski, said he had
received several news media inquiries about the size of the search.
He said it was on the same scale as many others the Coast Guard
performs each year that receive little public notice, and added
that it was ``necessary and appropriate given the uncertainty and
the size of the search area.''
</P>
<P>
   In its statement, the Bessette family said: ``John and Carolyn
were true soulmates, and we hope to honor them in death in the
simple manner in which they chose to live their lives. We take
solace in the thought that together they comfort Lauren for
eternity.''
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference, President Clinton said he believed the
search should continue. ``John Kennedy and his sister and later his
wife were uncommonly kind to my daughter and my wife,'' he said.
``This has been a very difficult thing for us personally, as well
as because of my position. They are very strong people, and I think
they're carrying on as well as any human beings could, but they
need the support and prayers of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Ehud Barak, the new Israeli prime minister, appearing with
Clinton, called the deaths a ``tragedy that I believe touched
hearts of billions all around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy did not obtain his pilot's license until April 1998. He
said he had been fascinated by flight since childhood. In an
interview in 1995, replayed Monday on the ABC talk show ``The
View,'' Barbara Walters asked if he once had wanted to be an
astronaut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I did _ helicopter pilot, astronaut, something in the
air,'' he said. ``Growing up, there were always helicopters landing
on the front lawn of the White House, and usually one parent or
another would emerge from them, so I kind of got this thing about
helicopters.'' Asked when that changed, he laughed and said, ``I'm
not sure it's changed.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton pledged Monday that he would get
in touch with President Hafez Assad of Syria to stress that a
``golden opportunity'' lay before him to complete a peace deal with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke as he and Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel
completed a series of meetings.
</P>
<P>
   From their joint announcement at a news conference of plans to
increase military assistance to Israel, to a plan to include
Israeli astronauts on a NASA shuttle journey next year, Clinton and
Barak appeared eager to show that the United States' relationship
with Israel has been reinvigorated.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders also announced that financing would be provided
for Israel's acquisition of additional Arrow anti-missile systems,
which could defend Israel against Iran and Iraq. This is one of
several measures that had been planned several years ago but
delayed during the tenure of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   The Arrow system was delayed for American budget reasons, other
measures because of deterioration in relations over the lack of
progress in peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would ask Congress to expedite approval of
economic assistance to Israel, the Palestinian Authority and Jordan
that had been promised last fall on condition that the
land-for-security deal completed at Wye, Md., moved ahead. That
money has also been stalled because of the stalemate in carrying
out the Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will probably contact Assad by telephone in the coming
days, a senior administration official said. By reaching out to
Assad, Clinton will be taking the first step in the process that
Barak has said he hopes will result in a basis for a comprehensive
Middle East settlement within 15 months.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to his telephone and other contacts over the years
with Assad, Clinton said at the news conference, ``He knows very
well that I am committed to the peace process between Israel and
Syria and that I believe that he has a golden opportunity now to
resume that process.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who met with Assad in Geneva in 1994, said the United
States ``would like more normal relations with Syria.'' Syria is
one of the last Arab states officially at war with Israel and is
critical to achieving the overall Middle East settlement that Barak
says he envisions.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said Clinton would tell Assad of
Barak's determination to move forward and will try to find out what
Syria wants or expects in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But the officials also said Clinton hopes to reduce the
traditional role of intermediary that the United States has played
between Syria and Israel. During this process, there has been no
direct contact between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we proceed that way, nothing will get done in 15 months,''
a senior administration official said. ``We hope to see more direct
contact.''
</P>
<P>
   In his meetings with Clinton, Barak said Israel would never
agree to return to the borders that existed before the 1967 war, an
Israeli official reported last week. But he added that Israel is
willing to pull back partly from the Golan Heights, on the border
with Syria, if the two countries can agree on other issues, like
the status of Lebanon and ending terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Syria remains on the State Department's list of nations that it
says support terrorism. But a report from the Middle East on Monday
said that Syria had called on guerrillas that it supports in
Lebanon to ``call off the armed struggle'' and to transform
themselves into political groups.
</P>
<P>
   An official in Barak's delegation said that the report was
almost ``too good to be true'' but could be an encouraging sign
about the purposefulness of Assad's recent statements that he
wanted to resume negotiations with Israel. Clinton and Barak both
welcomed the reports, while cautioning that they were uncertain
whether the accounts were accurate.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing increased military assistance, which needs
congressional approval, the administration was also outlining a
plan under discussion for some time to restructure aid to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Under this new formula, the United States would phase out
economic assistance, now $1.2. billion a year, while increasing
military assistance. Israel now receives $1.8 billion a year in
military assistance, and in $60 million increments over the next 10
years, this would be increased to $2.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The phaseout of economic assistance comes as the Israeli economy
has grown more robust and more integrated into the global market.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In another indication of their new confidence, the two leaders
announced they would establish a strategic policy planning group
composed of senior U.S. and Israeli security officials that would
report to them every four months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two leaders agreed to meet in joint session at regular
intervals,'' the joint communique they released said in reference
to the planning group.
</P>
<P>
   A group like this was proposed during the negotiations at Wye,
but, administration officials said, it would have lacked the
authority to make meaningful recommendations or decisions on
Israel's security needs. ``It was a good idea that never got off
the ground,'' a senior administration official said. ``The new
committee will do more, more frequently and meet with the prime
minister and the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new formulation, the officials would consider ways to
enhance Israel's security in the face of a comprehensive peace
settlement, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In their communique, the two leaders said they would sign a new
agreement allowing for ``broad cooperation'' between various
agencies of both governments on responding to the threat of
terrorism by means of weapons of mass destruction.

   On the sensitive issue of Jonathan Jay Pollard, a former U.S.
Navy intelligence analyst who is serving a life sentence in the
United States for spying for Israel, Barak declined to comment at
the news conference, beyond saying he would like to see him
released.
</P>
<P>
   Pollard was arrested in 1985, pleaded guilty and was given a
life sentence in 1987. Clinton has twice denied clemency to
Pollard. But on the last day of the talks at Wye last year, Clinton
pledged to Netanyahu that he would review the Pollard case after
Netanyahu made it an issue and the director of Central
Intelligence, George Tenet, threatened to resign if he were
released, senior American officials said at the time. Clinton asked
Charles Ruff, the White House counsel, to compile an interagency
report on whether Pollard should be released.
</P>
<P>
   After the news conference, the national security adviser, Sandy
Berger, said that Barak, like all other Israeli prime ministers who
had met with Clinton, had raised the issue of Pollard's status with
the president.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said Clinton had not yet received the report from Ruff.
</P>
<P>
   According to Berger's account of the conversation between
Clinton and Barak on the Pollard case, the prime minister said that
the Pollard case should not be part of the peace negotiations. At
Wye, Netanyahu had threatened to walk out unless Pollard was
released.

<P>
   By accounts from American and Israeli officials, Barak and
Clinton, who did not know each other well before the prime minister
arrived last Wednesday, developed a good rapport during two,
lengthy one-on-one sessions and then over meals and at other
meetings during the visit.
</P>
<P>
   But both leaders were short on details at their news conference
Monday on what the unfolding peace efforts might look like. Barak
said it was ``too early'' to talk about the results of permanent
status talks between the Palestinians and Israel on difficult
questions like borders, refugees and the disposition of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he saw a Palestinian state emerging from the talks
by the end of the year, Barak said, ``I am confident that the
nature of the Palestinian entity will emerge quite naturally out of
these permanent status negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak had his last scheduled meeting with Clinton at the White
House on Monday afternoon. Earlier, the prime minister met with
officials of the American Israel Political Action Committee, a
national organization that lobbies Congress on behalf of Israeli
issues, and Monday evening met with Tenet and attended a dinner at
the home of the Israeli ambassador, Zalman Shoval.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, his last day in the United States, Barak will hold a
series of meetings on Capitol Hill and attend a lunch to be held by
Vice President Al Gore in his residence.

 COMPANIES FORCING THEIR WAY TO COMMUNICATIONS HEAD TABLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the smoke clears from the communications industry's latest
takeover battleground, the companies that recently fired so many
billion-dollar salvos _ Global Crossing, Frontier, Qwest and US
West _ have left unresolved questions scattered like so many shell
cases.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the news releases, it all looks fairly simple _ a
win-win web of deals that leaves each company in a stronger
position to profit from the expanding demand for advanced
communications. US West Inc., the smallest of the Bell local phone
giants, is to merge with Qwest Communications International Inc.,
the long-distance upstart, while Global Crossing Ltd., an undersea
cable company, acquires the Frontier Corp., which owns an advanced
national communications network.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the surface, however, the resolution is not nearly so
neat. Qwest and US West have a lot of work ahead of them _ in the
executive suite, in the marketplace and in Washington _ before they
can make their deal a success. At the same time, while Frontier may
have come away with a lot of money in its pocket, it has also
emerged with a bad taste in its mouth.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more revealing tidbits to come out of the deal was a
handout distributed on Sunday by Qwest and US West, summarizing the
businesses of several companies. Somewhat selectively, the handout,
titled ``Global Telecommunications Comparisons'' listed AT&AMP;T, MCI
Worldcom, Sprint and Qwest-US West.
</P>
<P>
   Together with US West, Qwest would certainly like to be thought
of as a member of that tier of the industry. If anything, Qwest's
lusty pursuit of US West was about trying to win a spot at the head
table of telecommunications, even if that meant shoving some people
to get there. But even after this deal, Qwest has not quite
achieved that scale.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the companies announced Monday that they would soon
expand into 25 additional U.S. markets, including New York. The
plans were somewhat vague, with no firm timetable on building or
acquiring local fiber-optic networks and no firm figures on how
much the combined company would spend on the plan. But as the
company faces threats mostly from AT&AMP;T and SBC, it is a logical and
strong expansion of its strategy, one that could generate many
benefits for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, perhaps, none of those 25 markets is in the territory
served by BellSouth, which has invested in Qwest. All the better,
perhaps, to minimize the antitrust concerns were a combined
Qwest-US West to leap fully to the top tier in the next few years
by merging with BellSouth. (No such deal appears to be in the
works.)
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust regulators are not likely to have many concerns about
the deal, but the Federal Communications Commission is another
story.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that US West is not allowed to sell long-distance
services and Qwest sells somewhere around $200 million worth of
them in US West's territory every year. Qwest has said it is ready
to sell that business, and if it does, the merger will probably go
through.
</P>
<P>
   But until US West wins long-distance permission, it will be
unable to exploit the main driver of the deal: integrated local and
long-distance services for millions of customers.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators and consumer advocates should hope that this problem
will encourage US West to open its local networks as quickly as
possible to help it win long-distance approval. In any case it is
going to be years _ perhaps only a couple, perhaps more than a few
_ before US West has fully satisfied the FCC on that score.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The most intriguing question to emerge from the Qwest-US West
merger may be: What will Solomon Trujillo, now US West's chairman,
be doing two years after the deal closes?
</P>
<P>
   Trujillo lobbied hard to win a place for himself in the combined
company's top ranks. He will be a member of a newly formed office
of the chairman and will run the company's local and wireless
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he has been candid about the fact that the hand on
the day-to-day tiller will belong to Joseph Nacchio, Qwest's chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Looming over both of them will be Philip Anschutz, the secretive
Denver billionaire who will remain chairman of the company's board.
</P>
<P>
   Anschutz has come to resemble dark matter, that elusive cosmic
substance that cannot be seen directly but which can be detected by
its intense gravitational effects. Anschutz works hard to avoid the
public eye, but it was he, as the largest shareholder in Qwest, who
negotiated the side deal between Qwest and Global Crossing that
made the weekend agreements possible.
</P>
<P>
   All of which means that Trujillo will not be running the show,
which may not remain to his liking. Nacchio and Trujillo seem to
enjoy each other's company, but it would be a great surprise if
Trujillo outlasted Nacchio.
</P>
<P>
   That said, Nacchio has never run a significant local phone
operation, and if Trujillo and too many members of his senior team
leave the combined company, that would greatly set back the process
of integrating the two operations.
</P>
<P>
   So it was all smiles Monday at the headquarters for Qwest,
Global Crossing and US West. But not in Rochester, N.Y., home of
Frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Choose the word: manipulated, used, jobbed. Frontier declined to
comment, but it was crystal clear that Frontier's top executives
felt that they had been mistreated by Qwest over the last few weeks
and that they were not happy about it.
</P>
<P>
   The details are somewhat tawdry, but the point is that from
Frontier's perspective, Qwest failed to negotiate in good faith
after making a public bid to acquire Frontier for more than Global
Crossing had offered. Frontier's suspicion was that Qwest had made
its bid for Frontier only as a tool to get US West. US West's
earlier deal with Global Crossing was contingent on Global
Crossing's also acquiring Frontier.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all part of deal making,'' was Nacchio's response
Monday, pointedly denying any absence of good faith on his part.
``We came out with the crown jewels. A lot of my shareholders did
not like the Frontier move as much as they liked US West.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``The fact that Frontier thought they could get more
money than they did is all part of deal making. They should have
agreed to some of what we offered earlier.''

MISSOURI, KANSAS LOOK TO BOOST LIFE SCIENCES RESEARCH AND

 JULIUS A. KARASH  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Cheryl Nevins, a scientist with a firm called
XenoTech in Kansas City, Kan., carefully draws samples from a
beaker containing liquefied human livers and injects them into
hundreds of tiny plastic tubes.
</P>
<P>
   XenoTech will use the liver samples to test how drugs being
developed by other companies interact with other drugs when they
enter the human body.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is having a big impact on the drug development process,''
said Andrew Parkinson, XenoTech's chief executive officer. ``This
will allow us to eliminate problem drugs before they reach the
clinical market,'' where they are tested on humans.
</P>
<P>
   XenoTech is one of a growing number of area players in the
bustling field of life sciences research and development.
Participants include hospitals, universities and private companies.
Their activities range from studying diseases to testing drugs to
conducting research on crop protection chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Missouri and Kansas are looking at ways to augment
these activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the opportunity to tap into the knowledge and
resources we have at our disposal, without reaching beyond our
borders, to build a critical mass of life science industries that
will mold the Missouri economy for generations to come,'' Missouri
Gov. Mel Carnahan said at a June 30 meeting on the subject in
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The local life sciences arena got a big boost this year from
Quintiles Transnational Corp., which paid about $93 million for
Hoechst Marion Roussel's Kansas City, Mo., drug development and
approval operations. The facility develops drugs for the
pharmaceutical market and seeks regulatory approval of those drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Quintiles bought all of Hoechst Marion's Kansas City drug
development activities. In June, Quintiles announced a big
expansion here and its local employment, now about 680, is expected
to grow to 1,050 by 2002. Quintiles also conducts clinical drug
trials in Lenexa, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Hoechst Marion doesn't do research work in the Kansas City area.
Still to be determined is whether Hoechst Marion's North American
headquarters will stay in Kansas City after its German parent
company merges with Rhone-Poulenc of France, a move that the
shareholders of each company approved last week.
</P>
<P>
   Other research centers in the Kansas City area include
Children's Mercy Hospital, which conducts $6 million worth of
funded research a year. The hospital late last year received a $1.5
million grant from the Hoechst Marion Roussel Foundation to study
the effects of medicine on children. The new unit for this research
is expected to open by early September.
</P>
<P>
   The Bayer Research Park in Stilwell, Kan., is one of three Bayer
Corp. sites around the world where the company does research
related to crop protection products. The two others are in Japan
and Germany. Bayer's animal health pharmaceutical manufacturing
site in Shawnee, Kan., completed a $60 million expansion late last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The area research-and-development scene also includes players
such as Avax Technologies Inc., a Kansas City, Mo., company that is
working on cancer immunotherapies, and Cydex Inc., an Overland
Park, Kan., biotechnology company.
</P>
<P>
   The local research pool is down for a huge transfusion next year
with the expected opening of the Stowers Institute for Medical
Research. The institute will be built on the former site of Menorah
Medical Center at 4949 Rockhill Road.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kansas City area has a good scientific infrastructure,''
said Joe Lacz, vice president and general manager of Quintiles'
Kansas City area operations. ``You have Stowers, the University of
Missouri-Kansas City, the University of Kansas. They all have good
scientific research programs, clinical and preclinical.''
</P>
<P>
   Economic development officials say all-encompassing numbers have
not yet been quantified, but it is estimated that several thousand
people in the Kansas City area work in the field of life sciences
research and development.
</P>
<P>
   The economic potential of the life sciences field is the subject
of a task force recently formed by the Kansas City Area Development
Council and the Civic Council of Greater Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   John Edgar, task force co-chairman and lead resident partner of
the Bryan Cave law firm, says the group wants to determine whether
Kansas City can become a nationally known center for the life
sciences.

KENNEDY FLIGHT MAY HAVE ENDED IN OUT-OF-CONTROL PLUNGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for following changes in 6th graf: changes four seconds to 14
seconds; inserts `ending at 9:40 p.m.'; more accurately describes
the type of plane)  (mk) 
 By MIKE ALLEN and CAREY GOLDBERG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOURNE, Mass. _ The last flight of John F. Kennedy Jr. ended in
a terrifying, out-of-control plunge at 10 times the normal rate for
a descent, according to radar data released Monday, offering a
possible explanation for searchers' failure to recover remains or
significant pieces of wreckage from the Friday night crash off
Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   With the nation waiting and a thunderstorm threatening,
Massachusetts State Police divers began fishing through choppy,
murky waters off Martha's Vineyard for the first time since the
crash but came up with nothing, according to the authorities. One
object that sonar maps showed could be a big hunk of airplane
turned out to be a 14-foot boulder.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement late Monday, Kennedy's uncle, Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass., solemnly acknowledged what the Coast Guard had
determined Sunday night _ that the crash had apparently killed
Kennedy, who was 38, and his two passengers: his wife of nearly
three years, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33, and his sister-in-law,
Lauren Bessette, 34.
</P>
<P>
   ``John was a shining light in all our lives, and in the lives of
the nation and the world that first came to know him when he was a
little boy,'' Kennedy said. ``We pray that John, Carolyn and Lauren
will find eternal rest, and that God's perpetual light will shine
on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kennedy had become personally involved in the search as
early as 7 a.m. Saturday, when he called Gov. John Rowland of
Connecticut to ask for help searching the Long Island Sound area.
Rowland immediately dispatched National Guard helicopters to help
with the search, which gripped the nation as it played out on live
television all weekend.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Monday evening at Otis Air National Guard
Base here, investigators said that as Kennedy headed east toward
Martha's Vineyard, where he was trying to land before hopping over
to Hyannis for a family wedding, his single-engine, six-seat Piper
Saratoga II HP fell 1,100 feet in the final 14 seconds recorded on
radar, ending at 9:40 p.m., one hour after he left Fairfield, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Pearce of the National Transportation Safety Board, who
is leading the investigation, refused to characterize the drop
beyond pointing out that it was about 4,700 feet per minute.
Aviation authorities said a typical descent would be 400 to 500
feet per minute. Put another way, they said, Kennedy was going 50
mph straight down, possibly in a dive. Investigators and pilots
said it was still too early to say why the plane would descend at
that rate, but that it showed a severe problem such as pilot
incapacitation or equipment failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would indicate the airplane is out of control,'' said
Rudy Kapustin, who worked as an accident investigator at the NTSB
for 24 years, ending in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Kapustin said the pilot might have begun a normal turn but lost
sight of the horizon, then made the turn too tight, banking the
plane too far over and losing lift. ``That rate of descent is
extremely high, and there is no good reason, no operational reason,
why he would intentionally enter into that kind of rate of
descent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port, the tall American flag
continued to fly at full mast as evening fell, and family members
remained silent despite the tent city of reporters camped in front.
Only one major movement could be observed: the exodus of trucks
carrying equipment _ a generator, planks for a dance floor, tent
poles _ that had been rented for the wedding of Rory Kennedy, a
cousin of Juhn F. Kennedy Jr. The wedding had been scheduled for
Saturday and now has been postponed.
</P>
<P>
   Ethel and Max Kennedy could be seen out on the water for a short
sail. The family received communion in the morning from a priest in
white vestments. But otherwise, little movement was visible behind
the white picket fence of Marchant Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans remained stunned by the demise of the man they
had watched grow from ``John-John'' to ``the Hunk'' to the
publisher of a glitzy political magazine, George. As an indication
of the interest in the case, CNN and MSNBC broke away from a news
conference by President Clinton to cover a statement by the family
of Carolyn Kennedy Bessette, issued at their home in Greenwich,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference on Cape Cod, the authorities said no one
has reported seeing the plane crash. In a potential break for
investigators, Pearce said preliminary information from the plane's
previous owner is ``that there is a device that records possibly
the last transmission through the radio, which would be to
air-traffic control, over the transmitter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not know how this particular device works as yet, and we
are trying to determine if it was operational,'' Pearce added.
</P>
<P>
   A salvage ship and a submersible camera, both from the Navy,
arrived Monday to help with the search over 24 square miles off Gay
Head, the western tip of Martha's Vineyard. But the going has been
slow, and divers returned to shore before dark, as rain rolled in.
Pearce said searchers had recovered ``numerous small pieces of the
airplane, primarily interior cabin molding, some of the rugs, some
of the cushions, a rudder pedal,'' plus ``the right main landing
gear, which included the wheel and the brake assembly but not the
strut that would extend up above it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been no other exterior sheet metal of the airplane
recovered,'' he added. The largest piece found so far, he said, was
a rug that is about two feet square.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The state police divers from the Underwater Recovery Unit worked
from sonar maps that have been color-coded to show objects with
90-degree angles, indicating possible manmade objects.
</P>
<P>
   The divers, who are working in seas that are about 80 feet deep,
have nine more promising spots, which they call ``targets of
opportunity,'' that investigators have identified on sonar maps.
Debris is being taken to a hangar here, where NTSB investigators
are poring over refueling and maintenance records for Kennedy's
plane. Investigators said they also are interviewing people who saw
the plane depart New Jersey, and pilots and flight instructors who
flew with Kennedy and might be able to provide background
information.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy had suffered a sports injury shortly before his death.
The Toronto Star reported Monday that Keith Stein, vice president
for corporate affairs of Magna International Inc., an auto parts
company in Aurora, Ontario, said that when Kennedy flew in on July
12 to discuss investment in George magazine, he brought along a
flight instructor.
</P>
<P>
   ``John indicated he wasn't comfortable flying by himself with a
broken foot,'' The Star quoted Stein as saying. ``He mentioned
something about needing help with the pedals.''
</P>
<P>
   Rear Adm. Richard Larrabee of the Coast Guard, who had
maintained publicly that searchers were looking for survivors long
past the time experts expected they could have lived in the chilly
ocean, showed a similar optimism Monday about the search, pointing
to the sophisticated equipment that had arrived Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A Coast Guard spokesman, Cmdr. Mike Lapinski, said he had
received several news media inquiries about the size of the search.
He said it was on the same scale as many others the Coast Guard
performs each year that receive little public notice, and added
that it was ``necessary and appropriate given the uncertainty and
the size of the search area.''
</P>
<P>
   In its statement, the Bessette family said: ``John and Carolyn
were true soulmates, and we hope to honor them in death in the
simple manner in which they chose to live their lives. We take
solace in the thought that together they comfort Lauren for
eternity.''
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference, President Clinton said he believed the
search should continue. ``John Kennedy and his sister and later his
wife were uncommonly kind to my daughter and my wife,'' he said.
``This has been a very difficult thing for us personally, as well
as because of my position. They are very strong people, and I think
they're carrying on as well as any human beings could, but they
need the support and prayers of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Ehud Barak, the new Israeli prime minister, appearing with
Clinton, called the deaths a ``tragedy that I believe touched
hearts of billions all around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy did not obtain his pilot's license until April 1998. He
said he had been fascinated by flight since childhood. In an
interview in 1995, replayed Monday on the ABC talk show ``The
View,'' Barbara Walters asked if he once had wanted to be an
astronaut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I did _ helicopter pilot, astronaut, something in the
air,'' he said. ``Growing up, there were always helicopters landing
on the front lawn of the White House, and usually one parent or
another would emerge from them, so I kind of got this thing about
helicopters.'' Asked when that changed, he laughed and said, ``I'm
not sure it's changed.''

<P>
   If so, ``it would attract additional resources to this area that
would contribute to the overall development of the city,'' Edgar
said. ``It's a question of Kansas City pulling together all of its
resources in order to accomplish more than we could accomplish if
we didn't make that effort together.''
</P>
<P>
   Edgar said he and other task force members visited San Diego in
February and talked to officials there about how that city
developed into a major life sciences center. A similar trip is
planned for Birmingham, Ala. on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   One of the local task force participants is Ralph E. Kauffman, a
pediatrician, pharmacologist and director of research at Children's
Mercy.
</P>
<P>
   Kauffman notes that Children's Mercy collaborates with area
entities such as St. Luke's Hospital, Hoechst Marion, Midwest
Research Institute, the University of Kansas and the University of
Missouri-Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   And Children's Mercy looks forward to working with the Stowers
Institute, Kauffman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to expand and build,'' Kauffman said. ``The more
we can bring the research entities in the city to work together,
the more successful we will be in building the research strength in
the city, and this will benefit both our local economy and our
impact on the national economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from business, academia and private research
institutions are participating in the Governor's Roundtable
Discussion on Life Sciences in Missouri. The group held its first
meeting June 30 at the Hoechst Marion campus in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   In his address at the meeting, Carnahan said he envisioned ``a
Missouri with heavy concentrations of life science companies in
Kansas City, in St. Louis, in Columbia, and from there, corridors
branching out like spokes on a wheel.''
</P>
<P>
   Participants at the gathering included Bob Marcusse, president
and chief executive officer of the Kansas City Area Development
Council.
</P>
<P>
   According to a summary of the meeting discussions, Marcusse
suggested transferring tax credits from established companies to
start-up companies. ``Such a program would be unique and would get
the attention of many companies around the country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The roundtable is scheduled to reconvene in August in the St.
Louis area, where it will discuss capital formation for life
sciences. A third meeting, for which a date and locale have not yet
been set, is expected to focus on the international aspects of life
sciences, such as overseas marketing.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas, the state Department of Commerce and Housing is
providing staff support for the Life Sciences Task Force of the
Kansas City Area Development Council and Civic Council of Greater
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Janousek, the department's director of research and
analysis, says there are about 70 life sciences firms doing
business in Johnson, Wyandotte, Douglas, Miami, Leavenworth and
Jefferson counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want more,'' Janousek said. ``In Kansas, we're highly
dependent on agriculture and transportation equipment. Those are
the two main economic sectors of the state. Any area we can find to
expand our economic base will help us in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   Edgar said the local task force had not yet reached any
conclusions but would make a recommendation to the Area Development
Council and the Civic Council in October.
</P>
<P>
   David Welte, a local task force member and corporate counsel for
the Stowers Institute, said a strong community response ``will help
the Stowers Institute realize its potential. In turn, the institute
will be a catalyst to make Kansas City a center of scientific
research and biotechnology.''
</P>
<P>
   That sounds good to small firms such as Avax, a Kansas City
company working on cancer immunotherapies. Avax's research is
currently done in other parts of the country, but the company is
thinking about setting up its own lab, possibly in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   David Tousley, Avax's chief financial officer, says he welcomes
the idea of more venture capital and seed money for entrepreneurial
biomedical research companies here.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're successful, we could be on the verge of changing the
way cancer is treated in the world,'' Tousley said.
</P>
<P>
   Expansion plans also are in progress at XenoTech, whose
technology was developed in part at the University of Kansas
Medical Center. The 5-year-old company is 80 percent owned by
Parkinson, a former KU Medical Center professor, and 20 percent
owned by the University of Kansas Medical Center Research
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Parkinson says XenoTech and its 35 employees need to move to
larger quarters. The company may someday need an investment from a
venture capitalist, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Parkinson characterized the local life sciences task force as a
``superb idea,'' though he thinks it should have gotten on track
sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in danger of missing the boat,'' Parkinson said. ``These
technologies are up and coming in a variety of areas, particularly
on the West Coast and East Coast, as usual. We don't want to find
ourselves playing catch-up as a region.''

 PROFITS RISE AT CITIGROUP AND OTHER BANKS IN 2ND QUARTER
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Citigroup, the nation's largest financial services company, said
Monday that its second-quarter profit surged 21 percent as robust
consumer spending and the resilient stock market bolstered earnings
at several leading banks.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every area of activity at the Citigroup conglomerate,
from underwriting insurance policies at Travelers to advising
companies on mergers at Salomon Smith Barney, posted sharply
improved results. Cost reductions, especially in the group's
consumer division, helped the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding a $29 million charge for reorganization, Citigroup
earned $2.48 billion, or 71 cents a diluted share, compared with
$2.05 billion, or 57 cents a share, in the comparable quarter a
year earlier. Analysts had expected Citigroup to earn 65 cents a
share, according to the First Call Corp., which tracks company
earnings. Revenue rose 12 percent, to $14.68 billion from $13.06
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Nine of 25 banking analysts surveyed by First Call raised their
projected estimates of Citigroup's profits after the quarterly
results were released. For the full year, the consensus estimate
was raised to $2.77 a share from $2.65.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co., the fourth-largest bank in the United States
in terms of assets, also had a buoyant quarter, with profits rising
25 percent, to just more than $500 million. But the Bank of America
Corp., the nation's largest bank, eked out a modest profit gain of
2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely have banks enjoyed a more favorable economic environment.
Consumer spending has never been higher and is growing at the
fastest rate since the last recession, with many of the new
purchases being made on bank credit cards. The housing market, and
the banks' mortgage business, has remained strong despite rising
interest rates. And nearly all the leading banks now derive a chunk
of their earnings from stock and bond markets, where underwriting
and trading activity continues to grow quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The only downside to the profit picture is wariness about
whether banks can continue to expand their profits at a rate of
more than 20 percent, a pace that not long ago was associated with
the most successful small companies, some analysts said. Tempering
those concerns are signs in the latest quarter that banks are
streamlining their operations even as their revenue surges, helping
to prepare them for an eventual economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is as good as it gets for the banking world,'' said Judah
Kraushaar, a banking analyst at Merrill Lynch. ``They are working
to make it sustainable. It depends on what happens to the economy,
but we could see good numbers continue for a time.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One warning sign is that the traditional banking business of
taking deposits and making loans has not expanded quickly. Instead,
capital markets are lifting earnings at top New York banking
conglomerates like Citigroup and J.P. Morgan, which are known as
money center banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sun is shining on them right now,'' said David Berry,
chief of research at Keefe, Bruyette and Woods. ``The money center
banks are doing very well, but the regular old banks are not
growing anywhere near as fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry said he expected that the profit growth of 20 percent or
more reported by some top banks this quarter would probably give
way to a longer-term growth trend of 10 percent to 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Since the merger of Citicorp and Travelers Group was made final
in the fall, Citigroup has been the largest U.S. provider of
financial services and the second largest in the world, after
Deutsche Bank AG of Germany. It has become a bellwether for
financial companies because it is so diversified, serving both
retail and corporate customers, in commercial and investment
banking, in all major countries.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup said the consumer side of its business grew the
fastest, with profits rising 40 percent, to $1.11 billion. Reducing
expenses helped. The bank said it had cut $1.7 billion from
operating costs companywide since the merger and was expecting to
surpass its goal of reducing costs by $2 billion this year. On the
consumer side, full-time jobs and other positions were cut by
5,500, mostly in North America.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have new managers looking at ways to make their businesses
more efficient, and you also have prior restructurings coming into
play,'' said Diane Glossman, an analyst at Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest surprise was in the corporate and investment
banking operation, which had been subject to considerable turmoil
after the merger. The division earned $1.26 billion, a 26 percent
gain. The figure includes a 75 percent profit surge as the bank's
Salomon Smith Barney subsidiary earned $610 million on the strength
of trading and commission revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Benefits from the merger have already helped the bottom line in
corporate banking, Citigroup said. It cited 67 banking deals on
which it earned fees that were made possible by combining the
efforts of the old Travelers Group with the old Citibank corporate
banking arm.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp reductions in expenses helped Bank of America post a small
gain in profit in the second quarter. It earned $2.06 billion, or
$1.15 a diluted share, compared with $2.02 billion, or $1.13 a
share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $16.05 billion from $16.46
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Expenses fell 6.5 percent, to $4.57 billion. The number of
employees dropped almost 10 percent, to 162,000. Those reductions
were largely the result of combining the operations of the
BankAmerica Corp. and the Nationsbank Corp. last year into Bank of
America, which is based in Charlotte, N.C. The cost trims helped to
offset declines in the combined bank's mortgage servicing and
investment banking businesses.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan's profit was $504 million, or $2.52 a share,
compared with $4.02 million, or $1.96 a share, a year earlier.
Revenue was $2.19 billion, up slightly from $2.15 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The bank kept expenses steady, while revenue from investment
banking grew 26 percent. Morgan turned in an especially strong
performance in the highly competitive business of underwriting and
trading stocks, analysts said.

ITALIAN TEAM RIDER OUSTED FOR USING DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANNEMEZAN, France _ In the first drug scare since this year's
Tour de France began, an Italian team announced Monday that it had
dismissed a rider after he told a race doctor that he used a
cortisone substance to treat a knee injured in a crash last month.
</P>
<P>
   The team, Lampre, said it had taken ``preventive measures''
because the rider, Ludo Dierckxsens, had not also informed the team
doctor. Dierckxsens won the 11th stage last Thursday and told the
race doctor about his use of the drug as he was taking a urine test
required of all daily winners.
</P>
<P>
   Dierckxsens, the 34-year-old Belgian national champion, was
first said to have given the team doctor a prescription for the
corticoid, which was identified as Synacthene, but the team later
denied this assertion. Corticoids, synthetic derivatives of
cortisone, can be used to treat inflammation.
</P>
<P>
   Synacthene is banned as a performance enhancer but is legal when
used as a curative agent under medical control.
</P>
<P>
   The International Cycling Union, which governs bicycle racing,
said the drug taken by Dierckxsens had not affected his performance
in the Tour. The drug stays in the body only a few days, the
cycling union said.
</P>
<P>
   The team director of Lampre, Pietro Algeri, was unclear whether
the team had fired the rider or simply dropped him from its squad
for the Tour. Algeri said that at noon, Dierckxsens left the team's
hotel in Odos, overlooking the Pyrenees, which the race enters
Tuesday. Monday was the second of two rest days.
</P>
<P>
   Dierckxsens was 60th over all after Sunday's 14th stage. His
victory in the stage will stand.
</P>
<P>
   The Belgian has not been publicly accused of failing any drug
test, either after he won the stage or after he won his national
championship on June 27. He injured the knee in the Tour of Germany
a few weeks before the Belgian one-day race.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Marie Leblanc, the director of the Tour de France, said of
Lampre's decision: ``There was no other choice but to expel their
rider after he admitted taking drugs. Morally it was no longer
acceptable for him to participate.'' Leblanc said the Tour would
have had to expel Dierckxsens had his team not acted.
</P>
<P>
   The cycling union said it planned no disciplinary action because
Dierckxsens had not failed a drug test. Four Lampre riders failed a
blood test last month in the Tour of Switzerland, sparking
speculation that the team's invitation to the Tour de France might
be revoked. It was not.
</P>
<P>
   After last year, when the entire Festina team was ousted because
its officials admitted to systematic doping and the subsequent
rider protests over police investigatory methods, the Tour has
sought to refurbish its image as the world's greatest bicycle race.
Investigations into that case and a half dozen more continue in
France and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The race this year has been clouded by suspicion and innuendo
about riders' performances, as Lance Armstrong, the American who
leads the Tour, noted Monday at a news conference. Some of the drug
rumors have focused on him, especially after he won a demanding
stage in the Alps a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, the leader of the U.S. Postal Service team, said he
had heard only sketchy reports about the Dierckxsens case. ``But
it's bad for the sport and bad for Ludo,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a question about some of the Festina riders who
confessed and served suspensions, Armstrong said he considered them
rehabilitated. He mentioned particularly Alex Zuelle and Laurent
Dufaux, two Swiss who have changed teams and are ranked third and
fourth in the overall standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider them now as clean riders, honestly,'' he said.
``When I look at Zuelle now, I see him as a clean rider.''
</P>
<P>
   He sidestepped a similar question about Richard Virenque, the
star French climber who was the leader of that Festina team and has
not confessed to using drugs despite charges against him by former
team officials. Virenque was banned by Tour organizers and
reinstated by the cycling union.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is French cycling,'' Armstrong said. ``When they allowed
him back into the race, I was happy. If he hadn't been here, the
public would have been very disappointed.'' &QL;

MRS. CLINTON POSTPONES TRIP TO NEW YORK
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hillary Rodham Clinton postponed Monday what would
have been her third trip to New York as a prospective Senate
candidate in as many weeks, citing the disappearance and presumed
death of John F. Kennedy Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``This week's trip has been postponed because of the Kennedy
tragedy,'' said Mrs. Clinton's spokesman, Howard Wolfson, reading
from a written statement. ``Mrs. Clinton joins with the president
in sending her prayers and thoughts to the Kennedy and Bessette
families during this very difficult period.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's advisers described the first lady as distraught
over the apparent death of Kennedy. In discussing the trip's
postponement, they also said that, as a matter of appearances, it
might not be appropriate for the Mrs. Clinton to be portrayed as
tending to her own political ambitions while the search for
Kennedy's downed plane and its occupants continued.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton had planned to spend just over two days in New York
in the Southern Tier-Finger Lakes region, with stops in Elmira,
Ithaca and Bath.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are indications that her visits to the state are
becoming slightly more routine with their frequency, her trip to
Elmira promises to be of particular note. That is because Mrs.
Clinton, who has never lived in New York, in an apparently
unscripted aside last month, boasted that she had ``been to
Elmira.''
</P>
<P>
   That was news to people in Elmira. The Star-Gazette of Elmira
took note of the remarks by Mrs. Clinton, and interviewed town
Democratic leaders, none of whom could recall a visit from her. The
first lady's aides later explained that she had passed through the
town as a child, on a family excursion from her hometown of Chicago
to Scranton.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson said that Mrs. Clinton's trip to Elmira would be
rescheduled for sometime over the next month. ``As soon as
possible,'' Wolfson said.

 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Peter Fitzgerald, R-Ill., was not supposed to
be like this.
</P>
<P>
   He was supposed to be a creature of the far-right fringe of his
party, at least if you listened to the opponent he unexpectedly
defeated in the Illinois Republican primary last year. He was
supposed to be a lock-step soldier in the conservative brigade, at
least if you listened to his Democratic adversary in the general
election, former Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, on gun control and new regulations for managed health
care, the two most hotly contested, bitterly partisan issues in the
Senate so far this year, Fitzgerald broke party ranks to side with
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Only one other Republican senator, John Chafee of Rhode Island,
did likewise. But while Chafee had been giving party leaders angina
for decades, Fitzgerald had been expected to cause no palpitations
of the Republican heart.
</P>
<P>
   His votes, especially his dissent late last week on managed
care, raised questions about whether he was shaping up to be yet
another Republican wild card _ like Chafee or Arlen Specter of
Pennsylvania or Olympia Snowe of Maine _ whose support for the
party's position could never be taken for granted or tallied in
advance.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in his Capitol Hill office Monday, Fitzgerald
said that despite the extremist portraits painted by detractors
during his campaign, ``I'm voting the way I had suggested to the 12
million people of Illinois I would be voting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I represent 12 million people in Illinois, and that's a
profound responsibility, and I don't intend to abdicate that
responsibility by giving my proxy to other people,'' Fitzgerald
said, referring to party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   That attitude has taken people on all points of the political
spectrum by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been considerable chatter within conservative circles
about these votes,'' said Marshall Wittmann, a congressional
analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research and
advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a general concern that he is, in the vernacular,
growing in Washington _ moving to the left,'' Wittmann said. ``No
one has closed the book and decided he's gone to the other side,
but people are wary of the early warning signs.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., said that he, too, had not
anticipated Fitzgerald's votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has shown more independence than the overwhelming majority
of his Republican colleagues,'' Durbin said. ``There's more
pragmatism there than I thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Fitzgerald's deviations from the conservative orthodoxy
can be seen at least partly in the context of his state, which
teeters between the two political parties and prides itself on a
centrist streak. The congressional delegation from Illinois is
evenly divided: 10 Republicans and 10 Democrats in the House, one
Republican and one Democrat in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control has been a particularly popular cause in Illinois
over the last five years, and several politicians cast as darlings
of the National Rifle Association have paid the price of defeat at
the polls.
</P>
<P>
   After once voting as a state legislator for a bill to allow some
Illinois residents to carry concealed weapons, Fitzgerald has said
that he had always been amenable to reasonable gun control. He said
that the Democratic proposal for mandatory background checks at gun
shows, which he and five other Senate Republicans supported, was
just such a measure.
</P>
<P>
   As for his rejection of the Republican version of a patients'
bill of rights, which nonetheless passed the Senate last week,
Fitzgerald said that it lacked a provision in the Democratic
alternative that he favored: a removal of obstacles that prevent
patients in health maintenance organizations from suing those
insurers for malpractice.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald said that his position was wholly in line with his
conservative views on the benefits of a free market.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there were a downside for HMOs to harm people, maybe they'd
be more careful, so I think actually lifting their tort immunity
would be a free-market way to improve their behavior,'' he said.
``Some of the rogue behavior we hear about from HMOs may stem from
this lack of accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald, who was a classics major at Dartmouth College and
graduated from law school at the University of Michigan, has a
tendency to lapse into wonkish commentaries on policy. He also has
an affable demeanor, and a slightly crooked grin that is a result
of Bell's palsy, which caused a subtle, permanent paralysis in the
muscles on the right side of his face.
</P>
<P>
   At 38, he is the Senate's youngest member, a man who leapfrogged
directly from the Illinois Senate to the U.S. Senate on the power
of his intense ambition and his personal wealth, tied to his
family's suburban banking fortune. About $12 million of the roughly
$15 million that he spent on the Senate primary and general
election last year came out of his own pocket.
</P>
<P>
   On fronts other than guns and HMOs, Fitzgerald, who is Catholic,
married and the father of a 7-year-old son, is among the Senate's
most conservative members. He opposes abortion, making exception
only in cases when pregnancy or childbirth endanger a woman's life.
His distaste for taxes is keen.
</P>
<P>
   But his pet economic peeve is what he described as the
flattering, deceptive way in which the federal government
calculates surpluses, an arithmetic he would banish with his Truth
in Budgeting Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``That act is encountering bipartisan resistance,'' he said with
a hearty, mischievous laugh that suggested his days of ruffling
feathers were just beginning.

 &HT;    Dell launches auction site for used computers
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Dell Computer Corp. already is the world's most
profitable computer company.
</P>
<P>
   Now Dell has found a way to make money off its competitors'
computers, too.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Dell launched dellauctions.com, a computer auction
site where users can sell their own used goods alongside Dell's
products. Round Rock, Texas-based Dell will make $2 every time
someone lists an item on the site _ even a computer made by its
chief competitor, Houston-based Compaq Computer Corp. Riding the
crest of high flying consumer auction Web sites such as Ebay Inc.
and Ubid Inc., dellauctions.com had several hundred thousand hits
in its first eight hours and more than1,000 items up for sale, the
company said. On the auction site, Dell is allowing, even
encouraging, users to hawk used wares ranging from computers to
Palm Pilots to keyboards.
</P>
<P>
   While the site allows users to buy and sell their own goods,
dellauctions.com is also a clearinghouse for the company's products
_ many of which are refurbished or older computers that have been
returned after a leasing period.
</P>
<P>
   Dell is hoping visitors to the site will unload their old
computers and peripherals and then click over and shop at dell.com,
the company's flagship sales site, with their newfound cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're positioning ourselves as the first major computer
company to offer auction services,'' said Robert Langer, director
of dell.com. ``It gives our customers another outlet to dispose of
older machinery and take advantage of purchasing new products from
Dell.''
</P>
<P>
   How lucrative can catering to the highest online bidder be?
</P>
<P>
   Forrester Research Inc. estimates consumer auctions will grow
from a sales volume of $1.4 billion in 1998 to $19 billion in 2003.
And the makeup of auction sites will shift from predominantly
person-to-person to business-to-consumer auctions.
</P>
<P>
   James Carney, president of Bidder's Edge, a site that tracks
bargains at online auction sites, said there are about 400 auction
sites, but added that established companies such as Dell may have
an advantage in attracting new business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest growth is in the merchant side, in the stores,''
Carney said. ``That business will be literally two-thirds greater
than person-to-person bidding in the next 24 months.''
</P>

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Six years ago this month, a disgruntled
businessman named Gian Luigi Ferri took two TEC-9 semiautomatic
pistols into the office tower at 101 California St. here and, in
less than 15 minutes, killed eight people and wounded six others,
before turning a gun on himself in a stairwell and committing
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The sound of those shots has rung through California politics
ever since, helping to inspire a long-running debate over gun
control that reached a milestone Monday when Gov. Gray Davis signed
into law the nation's toughest and most comprehensive ban on
assault-style weapons. It passed the state legislature by 2-1
margins last week, after years of partisan feuding and the veto of
a similar measure by Davis' Republican predecessor, Pete Wilson,
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends, guns do kill people,'' Davis said at an elaborate
signing ceremony at the San Francisco Hall of Justice, surrounded
by a sea of highway patrol and police officers and relatives of the
victims of the 101 California shootings. ``In short, assault
weapons on our street are an assault on our common values. Today,
California fights back.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, California has not been alone in fighting back, or
at least trying to. Amid the fierce congressional gun-control
deadlock that followed the Columbine High School shootings this
spring, state legislatures around the country have been grappling
with a variety of proposals to restrict firearms. But no other
measure yet has gone so far as California's. Political
professionals in both parties here say the bill's enactment
reflects a steady shift in public opinion and political winds in a
state that first adopted a law banning dozens of specific weapons
in 1989, after five children were shot to death outside an
elementary school in Stockton.
</P>
<P>
   But gun manufacturers eluded that law by changing the names and
model numbers of the banned weapons. The new measure aims to close
that loophole by outlawing characteristics instead of specific
weapons, essentially banning the manufacture, import or sale of any
semi-automatic rifles or pistols that can hold more than 10 rounds
of ammunition or can be easily concealed, or have any one of
various accessories like pistol grips or folding stocks _ a
stricter standard than the existing federal ban on some 20 types of
assault weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The new law also makes it a crime to manufacture, import, sell
or give away any magazine that can hold more than 10 rounds of
ammunition. And earlier Monday, Davis signed a separate measure
barring any individual from buying more than one handgun in a
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a prototype for reasonable gun-control legislation,
and if it can be done in California I would argue that it can be
done in the United States as a whole,'' said Sen. Don Perata, a
Democrat and a former Alameda County school teacher who sponsored
the assault weapons measure. ``This state is large enough and
diverse enough to reflect the diversity of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   This is not, as many people would think, a progressive state.
There are ways in which it's pretty conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the New York region, Connecticut and New Jersey ban the sales
of assault weapons, but New York state does not, and while New
Jersey prohibits the sale of ammunition clips with more than 15
rounds, Connecticut and New York have no such bans. None of those
three states limit the number of handguns that someone can buy in a
month, though Maryland, South Carolina, Virginia and Los Angeles
limit such sales to one a month.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The ban on assault weapons, which takes effect Jan. 1, may be
heavily symbolic. No one knows for certain how many such weapons
exist in California now, and owners of guns covered by the ban will
have a year to register their weapons or face penalties, of up to
$500 for first-time offenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good politics from the sponsors' perspective, but it's
close to completely meaningless,'' said Steve Helsley, the
California lobbyist for the National Rifle Association, who
nevertheless fought the measure vigorously and now contends that
weapons banned by the bill could be easily converted to elude it,
by sawing off a pistol grip, for example. ``This is political
buffoonery, and it is going to inconvenience a lot of people. It
will result in people going to jail who didn't know what they were
doing wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is precisely the powerful symbolism of restricting what
Davis, a Vietnam veteran, on Monday called a ``weapon of war,''
that has made this a potent political issue _ one that Davis and
his fellow Democrats used with great success in last year's
statewide elections and that they expect to use again next year
against Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, if he becomes the Republican
presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Political experts here say, the latest law succeeded because it
focused on the extraordinary category of weapons with
large-capacity ammunition and special features that the public is
most wary about. National polls have consistently shown that
roughly three-quarters of respondents support a ban on assault type
weapons, while most oppose a ban on all handguns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, we've just had such a string of incidents,
starting with the Stockton schoolyard and going to the North
Hollywood bank robbery, and all of those had assault weapons,''
said Bill Carrick, a leading Democratic political consultant and an
adviser to Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who was one of the state's
earliest and most unwavering advocates of gun control. ``I think
it's just left a deeper, more indelible impression on Californians'
political consciousness than in the rest of the country. The whole
thing has had a long, 10-year run as a major issue, and it's played
its way through a lot of campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Davis himself has undergone something of a sea change on the
issue. Though he voted for an assault weapons ban that failed to
pass as a member of the state assembly in 1985, longtime colleagues
say Davis was also deeply spooked by an unsuccessful 1982 state
ballot measure that would have frozen the number of handguns in the
state and was widely seen as helping draw conservative voters to
the polls to defeat the Democratic gubernatorial candidate that
year, Tom Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Davis advisers took pains to emphasize that the assault weapons
ban was a reasonable and sensible measure, and that Davis, who
campaigned last year as a passionate moderate, remained one. The
governor's aides have warned that Davis will not sign all of
perhaps 10 gun control measures that are headed to his desk this
year, though he is expected to approve bills setting safety
standards for so-called junk guns, the cheap handguns known as
Saturday night specials, and a requirement that guns be sold with
child safety locks.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Tony Quinn, a Republican strategist in Sacramento, acknowledged
that ``the Republicans have totally bobbled this issue as far as
suburban voters go.'' But he added, ``Now the dynamic will change,
and the Democrats will have to produce some results. We're told
that crimes will go down if we pass these bans on assault weapons,
so let's see them go down.''

MOVIE SETS SERBS' EMOTIONS ON EDGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CHRIS HEDGES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Serbia _ The most popular movie this summer in Serbia
is a historical drama about war, love and vengeance called ``The
Knife.''
</P>
<P>
   It has a chillingly familiar Balkan opening. A polite,
well-scrubbed family is at dinner when armed men burst into the
house, rape the young mother and then plunge knives into bodies and
shoot helpless men and women. The village is looted, almost
everyone is massacred and the homes are set ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   This movie has nothing _ yet everything _ to do with Kosovo. It
is a film that depicts the killings of hundreds of thousands of
Serbs during World War II by the Croatian fascists and their Muslim
allies.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to justify contemporary revenge and to perpetuate the
idea that the Serbs, even after Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo, remain
the region's victims.
</P>
<P>
   Vuk Draskovic, the leading opposition politician, wrote the
novel on which the film is based in 1982, long before entering
politics and almost a decade before the wars of Yugoslavia's
destruction began.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic said he had nothing to do with making the movie, which
opened before the war over Kosovo, was taken off screen during the
conflict and is now playing again. But he told the daily Blic that
he was glad to see the film, only wishing it had been made before
war started in Yugoslavia in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   `` `The Knife' would have helped outsiders to understand the
roots of these wars,'' Draskovic said, referring to the World War
II massacres that many Serbs felt were too little acknowledged in
the old Communist Yugoslavia. As that federation disintegrated,
emotions about the massacres fed Serbian nationalism and, among
some Serbs, a desire for revenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crimes that are not punished are repeated,'' Draskovic said.
The crimes committed by the Croatian Fascists, known as the
Ustashe, were ``erased,'' Draskovic said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Serbs had acted, as they should have,'' he said, ``they
would not have tarred the Muslims and the Croats with collective
guilt for the genocide committed in World War II against the Serbs.
But this did not happen, and everything exploded again. Everything
has been repeated.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the author and of such a blanket exculpation of
recent Serbian crimes say the movie encourages the belief that
historical wrongs committed more than 50 years ago give license to
settle scores with later generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Draskovic considers himself a reasonable nationalist,'' said
Stojan Cerovic, a columnist for the independent magazine Vreme,
``but he questions in his writings the right of those in the former
Yugoslavia to practice the Muslim religion. He insists that Muslims
are really Serbs who converted to Islam, yet he also portrays
Muslims as bloodthirsty and brutal Turks. His denial of Muslim
identity is itself a profound act of aggression.''
</P>
<P>
   In the novel, and the film, it is 1941 in Herzegovina, a
mountainous area of western Bosnia that historically was dominated
in its east by Orthodox Serbs, and in its west by Roman Catholic
Croats. The royalist government in Belgrade has capitulated to the
Germans, and a demobilized Serbian soldier returns home.
</P>
<P>
   The soldier's mother acidly comments that the Serbs ``must again
live under Turkish rule,'' implying that 500 years of Ottoman
occupation that ended in 1918 have returned with the Nazi
occupation. Snarling, unshaven and swarthy-looking Muslims, all
with red fezzes on their heads, inform the Serbian peasant family
that their fields now belong to the Muslims, because ``your state
is finished.''
</P>
<P>
   The pious family, with a Serbian Orthodox priest seated at the
head of the table, sits down for Christmas dinner. The Muslim
neighbors burst in, are welcomed as guests, but bind the Serbs to
the chairs. The Muslims rape a young mother, in a scene that never
seems to end, before knifing and shooting their victims.
</P>
<P>
   The gruesome images on the screen include blood dripping on the
face of Christ as liturgical music pumps out of the sound system.
Father Nikifor, the Orthodox priest, cries out as he is burned
alive in his church: ``God sees everything. We will get justice.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   His Muslim killers grin and chuckle as the flames engulf him.
And justice, if justice means revenge, becomes the theme of the
film.
</P>
<P>
   The infant of the young mother survives. He is given to a Muslim
woman and named Alija. The local imam informs the villagers that
since the baby has not been baptized, ``he has not yet been
dirtied.''
</P>
<P>
   It is wartime, and the Chetniks, Serbian royalist irregulars who
fought the Germans, attack the village and gun down most of the
Muslims. The shootings evoked applause in the theater at a recent
showing. Informed that a Serbian child is living with a Muslim
family, the Chetniks take an infant, but they take the wrong boy: a
Muslim who is then raised as a Serb.
</P>
<P>
   An encounter between the two boys, now grown, during the most
recent war in Bosnia concludes the film, a setting presumably
altered to reflect events after the book was written. The reunion
takes place during a battle scene that shows Muslims and Serbs
fighting on equal footing, rather than Serbian forces rounding up
and expelling Muslim villagers from their homes or raining shells
on a besieged Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian soldiers are depicted as honorable and pious _ like
those killed in the opening moments of the movie. The movie is
peppered with assaults on Muslim identity, bolstering a view held
by many Serbs that the Slavic Muslims of Bosnia and in other parts
of the old Yugoslav federation are descendants of Serbs who
converted to Islam during Ottoman rule.
</P>
<P>
   Dragan Nikolic, a well-known Serbian actor who plays a Muslim
cleric in the movie, has said that the most important sentence in
the film is that ``there are no better Muslims than Serb
converts.''
</P>
<P>
   Serbs are portrayed in the film as educated, cultured and urban.
Muslims are shown in squalid stone huts, dressed in traditional
baggy dress and surrounded by chickens and sheep. The films has
only two sympathetic Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   The first, who has stolen the property of his Serbian neighbors
as an Ustashe soldier, atones for his guilt and commits suicide.
The second, the Muslim cleric portrayed by Nikolic, informs Alija
that all Muslims are descended from Serbs and have committed crimes
against the Serbian people.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the final scenes, the cleric is shown kneeling in the
gutted remains of a Serbian home crossing himself and asking for
forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, viewers seem to go home with the message that the
recent wars are part of a struggle for identity that has bedeviled
the Balkans for centuries and continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a connection between the events portrayed in the
film, and the conflicts today,'' said Milan Roncevic, 58, a refugee
from Bosnia. ``The film points out that religious identity is the
greatest problem in our society and always has been.''
</P>
<P>
   Predrag Milovic, 26, was standing on the street after the movie.
``I wept when I read the book and I wept when I saw the film,'' he
said. ``It is all true. We are all the same people. It is like
physics: for every action there is a reaction. All sides have done
bad things. Who can say who is guilty?''

BAILOUT AUDIT IN MEXICO CITES $7.7 BILLION IN DUBIOUS LOANS
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By JULIA PRESTON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ A Canadian auditor on Monday presented a report
about the Mexican government's rescue of its banks concluding that
about $7.7 billion of the loans absorbed by the bailout were highly
irregular or plainly illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Mackey, the accountant hired by the Mexican Congress to
review the bailout, found that bank executives made billion-dollar
loans to themselves that they never repaid; that banks lent
millions of dollars to investors to buy shares in the same banks,
and that top bankers made large loans to friends and family without
as much as a credit study.
</P>
<P>
   The loans went bad and the government bought them from the
banks, leaving taxpayers to pick up the tab.
</P>
<P>
   Mackey's investigators identified $4.4 billion in loans to
people and companies with which the banks had some direct financial
relationship. He found $638 million in loans that he described as
clearly illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is couched in cool accountant's terms, Mackey's
report is a stinging critique of the loose practices and cronyism
of Mexico's banking system and of the government officials and
regulators who have overseen them since the early 1980s. The
overall cost to the government of the bailout has risen to about
$71 billion, or about 16.5 percent of Mexico's annual economic
output, according to figures provided in the report.
</P>
<P>
   The report found that government regulators and Finance Ministry
officials agreed to relax the rules of the bailout program, which
was started in 1994, once Mexico was rocked by a financial crisis
in 1995. As a result, the rescue absorbed loans worth billions of
dollars that the banks had little or no prospect of recovering and
that in some cases had been languishing on their books for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effect of these changes was to permit the sale of loans
that were of less quality and doubtful value, thereby placing a
greater financial burden'' on the bailout fund, the report reads.
</P>
<P>
   Mackey discovered that the banks had slipped $74 million in
loans to the government that did not meet any of the bailout fund's
easier requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The report does not mention any names of banks, bankers or
government officials. The document will be formally delivered on
Friday, after it has been translated from English into Spanish, to
a new agency that took over the bailout program after the old
agency was dissolved earlier this year. The new agency will have to
decide whether to bring any criminal prosecutions, Mackey said.
</P>
<P>
   The bailout program has been at the center of debate between the
opposition-controlled Congress and President Ernesto Zedillo for
the last 18 months. Government officials have defended the bailout
as an example of timely and relatively efficient action that saved
the financial system from collapse. Opposition lawmakers have
denounced the rescue as a case of the government's protecting inept
or corrupt bankers who they say are part of Mexico's narrow
political elite.
</P>
<P>
   The report cites the case of a bank that lent $4 billion to a
series of front companies, all controlled by the bank's chief
executive officer. ``The loans had been issued without a proper
credit study and the funds had been diverted to the benefit of the
chief executive officer,'' Mackey found. The government absorbed
losses amounting to $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Mackey was originally given six months to work on the audit when
he was hired last September. But, he said, stonewalling by
government officials, bank regulators and bankers blocked him for
months from talking with them or seeing bank records. The audit did
not get fully under way until March of this year.

PASSENGERS RECALL THEIR FEARS AS ROLLER COASTER DERAILED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 JENNIFER TAYLOR AND BENITA Y. WILLIAMS  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Investigators _ including officials from the
state fire marshal's office, Worlds of Fun and a roller coaster
manufacturer _ Monday still did not know what caused a weekend
derailment of a popular ride.
</P>
<P>
   But the chain of events is clear to riders David Unger and
Richard Barclay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came around the last curve, and it started shaking real
bad,'' Unger said. ``The harnesses popped open, and then we were
swinging.''
</P>
<P>
   Unger, 22, of Independence, Mo., and Barclay, 20, of North
Kansas City, Mo., were among the passengers in the last two cars of
the seven-car Orient Express that derailed about 9:30 p.m. Saturday
just as the ride was decelerating for its approach to a loading
platform.
</P>
<P>
   Barclay said he heard loud pops as the car traveled around the
last corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never saw my harness open. I heard the pops and then I was
falling to the ground,'' Barclay said. ``When I hit the groundall I
could see were the cars dangling above me.''
</P>
<P>
   Unger, who was clinging to the car with one hand, said all he
could think about was his friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him disappear into the dark to the ground,'' Unger said.
``I didn't know if my friend was alive. I didn't know if the other
train was going to run into us.''
</P>
<P>
   After about two minutes, Unger said, he couldn't hold on any
longer and let go.
</P>
<P>
   Unger said he landed on his back and was scraped by tree
branches. His neck also was sore.
</P>
<P>
   Barclay said the right side of his head and his right shoulder
were bruised.
</P>
<P>
   Sisters Robin Hoy, 11, and Rachal Burch, 14, of Holden, Mo., sat
for 2 hours in the same car the men had been riding in, dangling
about 35 feet above a brush-covered hill and small creek. The
sisters were rescued by firefighters who pulled them from the car
onto a 50-foot ladder.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, they were still shaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are banged up and bruised and are having nightmares,''
said their mother, Colleen Tock. ``It was pretty horrifying. They
saw two guys come flying down.''
</P>
<P>
   Tock said she was upset by the lack of information given to her
during the mishap.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't even offer me a glass of water,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tock said she asked repeatedly about her daughters but did not
know their condition until her 16-year-old son, who also was on the
roller coaster in a train behind the girls, got off safely and told
his parents 45 minutes after the car derailed.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Rau, Worlds of Fun director of marketing, said he
understood Tock's frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a perfect scenario,'' Rau said. ``Our main concern
is the safety of our guests. It takes so much of our energy to
concentrate on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rau said officials try to gather as much information as possible
in these situations, but that is secondary to their main concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did the best we could,'' he said. ``If I was a parent I
would react the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Rau said the park's policy is to try to get everyone involved to
go to the guest relations office, where information is
disseminated.
</P>
<P>
   The derailment could lead state legislators to reconsider
routine inspections of roller coasters.
</P>
<P>
   Under a law passed in 1997, Missouri requires a ride to be
inspected after death or serious injury occurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If no one is injured, they don't have to let the state
inspect,'' said state Rep. Bill Skaggs of Kansas City, who
sponsored the measure toughening amusement park regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Skaggs said Worlds of Fun might be wise to submit to a state
inspection even if Saturday's accident did not cause serious
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there wasn't serious injury, there was a serious
accident,'' Skaggs said. ``People who go out there have a right to
know what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Skaggs began pushing for tougher amusement park laws after an
accident involving another Worlds of Fun roller coaster killed
14-year-old Ryan Bielby in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Skaggs said he thinks Saturday's Orient Express derailment will
cause the inspection issue to resurface in the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be time to address that issue and take another look at
that section of the law,'' Skaggs said. ``I'll be following this
closely.''
</P>
<P>
   Skaggs said his original bill included routine inspections, but
that section was eliminated after amusement parks said their
insurance companies and good business practices required them to
inspect themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Amusement parks ``don't believe they have to have regular
outside inspections,'' Skaggs said. ``And they do a good job. They
can't afford to have injuries. But it doesn't hurt to have another
set of eyes looking at things.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Unger and Barclay said the accident wouldn't
keep them from returning to Worlds of Fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I would ride the Orient Express, but I'll ride
the Mamba,'' Barclay said.

UMPIRES WALK TO A CLIFF, AND NO ONE IS STOPPING THEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

<TEXT>
<P>
   By signing letters of resignation, major league umpires have
placed themselves in peril, labor experts on both sides of the
collective bargaining fence say. Richie Phillips, the umpires'
labor leader, disagrees. It won't be long before Major League
Baseball finds out who is right.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 umpires, all but a handful of the major league
complement, submitted their resignations, effective Sept. 2, last
Thursday. Major league officials have been scratching their heads
ever since trying to figure out Phillips' strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Several people who have vast labor experience, in and out of
sports, readily acknowledged they had no clue about the union's
thinking. The people, who included lawyers, baseball officials and
labor experts, declined to speak for attribution, but in several
interviews presented the uniform opinion that the umpires might as
well have taken a pledge to walk off a cliff together.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball, these experts explained, can simply
accept the resignations, sooner rather than later because it
doesn't have to wait until Sept. 2 to act on the letters. That
would send the umpires into the cold, jobless.
</P>
<P>
   Then, these experts said, Major League Baseball could turn
around and sue the umpires union for conducting an illegal strike,
even asking for triple damages.
</P>
<P>
   The umpires' labor agreement with the National and American
leagues bars them from striking. Umpires instead agree to submit
disputes to arbitration. The umpires are resigning, not striking,
but management and union people said their action was a thinly
veiled attempt to circumvent the no-strike provision.
</P>
<P>
   If the members resigned individually, they said, the union would
incur no legal problems. But, they said, the union has orchestrated
these resignations, making it an illegal strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an illegal strike, no question,'' one person with long
union experience said. ``It's not even as subtle as a sick-in. He
gathered the resignations and he sent the faxes. He's the only
official in the union. There's no defense here.''
</P>
<P>
   If Major League Baseball were to sue the union, it would have to
prove damages, but evidence could be available. The union person
said the owners could argue that the quality of post-season games
would decline because of the use of the amateur umpires who would
be hired to replace the departed umpires.
</P>
<P>
   The labor agreement calls for severance pay for umpires who
resign, up to $400,000 for those with 20 or more years of service.
Baseball could refuse to pay severance, however, on the grounds
that the action represented an illegal strike. Even if baseball
didn't sue the union, the union would have to sue baseball to get
severance pay.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute could be in the courts for perhaps two years, with
the umpires out of work and out of money.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips vehemently disagreed Monday with the notion that the
mass resignations constituted a strike. But he declined to discuss
the strategy behind that move.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball officials believe Phillips was certain that once they
were faced with the loss of the regular umpires and the prospect of
paying $15.5 million in severance, they would quickly invite him to
the bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
   Officials haven't determined a definite course of action, but
they are in no mood to negotiate with Phillips. Umpires, who were
presumably assured that talks would follow the receipt of their
resignation letters, have apparently begun to sense baseball's
stance and have begun trying to figure out their next step.
</P>
<P>
   The officials aren't certain the information is correct, but
they have heard that some umpires want to rescind their
resignations. But if Major League Baseball accepts the
resignations, it would then initiate the process of hiring
replacement umpires. Even here, the union has given baseball an
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   If union members strike and baseball seeks to hire replacement
workers, as it did in 1995 when the players were on strike, the
replacements are branded as scabs. That characterization frightens
away at least some potential replacements.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the umpires, however, there is no strike, the
union says. Baseball would be hiring new employees to replace
workers who resigned. The jobs would be permanent, not temporary
until a strike ended, and the new employees would not be labeled as
scabs. The hiring process would be easier.
</P>
<P>
   So the union could be faced with being hoisted on its own
double-edged sword: baseball could challenge its mass action as an
illegal strike but at the same time use that action to hire
permanent replacements with no taint to its own role.
</P>
<P>
   Besides resigning, the umpires plan to go to work for a new
company, incorporated by Phillips, called Umpires Inc. He has
planned to negotiate with baseball for the umpires' services as
part of the new company.
</P>
<P>
   But baseball would not be required to negotiate with Umpires
Inc. Employers are required to negotiate in good faith with their
unions, but Umpires Inc. is not a union. It is an independent
company that baseball could ignore, and it would have no legal
recourse, as a union would have.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the union has some other strategy than relying on a
belief that its members are irreplaceable, but none is apparent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he's bluffing, like in a poker game, to see how far it
will go,'' a person involved in another union said of Phillips. ``I
don't think he has a good hand.'' &QL;

IBM EARNS $2.4 BILLION, UP 65 PERCENT, IN QUARTER
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By SAUL HANSELL 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The International Business Machines Corp. said Monday it had
earned $2.4 billion in the second quarter, up 65 percent, largely
because of a gain from the sale of its Global Network Internet unit
to AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   IBM used much of the $2.1 billion after-tax gain to cover $1.2
billion in special charges related to reducing costs of memory and
hard disk manufacturing and a $241 million charge from an
accounting change.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding the special items, the company earned 91 cents a
share, three cents more than analysts had expected and 21 percent
more than the 75 cents a share it earned a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the margin, they are doing a little better than expected
because of their broad array of businesses,'' said Andrew J. Neff,
an analyst with Bear Stearns. He said that the bulk of the
company's per-share earnings growth was now coming from an increase
in operating profit. In recent years, IBM made up for slow profit
growth largely by buying back shares.
</P>
<P>
   IBM bought $3.7 billion worth of its shares in the first half of
the year, but its surging stock price lessened the impact.
</P>
<P>
   The company's revenues increased by 16 percent from a year ago,
to $21.9 billion. The biggest growth was in hardware, where revenue
increased by 22 percent to $9.4 billion. But a year ago, sales in
IBM's personal computer division were depressed because of a glut
of inventory.
</P>
<P>
   While IBM still lost $153 million in its PC business last
quarter, its sales increased by 50 percent, and the loss narrowed
from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The company's server division, which sells mid-size and
mainframe computers, suffered from slow sales increases and modest
profit declines.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's services unit, which designs and operates computer systems
for companies, continued to show vigorous growth, with a 15 percent
increase in sales, to $8 billion, and a 20 percent increase in
profit.
</P>
<P>
   Sales also increased by 9 percent in software, 10 percent in
technology components and 3 percent in financing.
</P>
<P>
   The technology component business, which IBM has highlighted as
a key area of growth, was difficult during the quarter, with prices
falling for disk drives and memory chips. Sales of custom logic
chips increased sharply and helped cover the declines in those
other products.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, IBM took a $770 billion charge to cover the cost of
converting a factory in France from memory chips to the custom
logic chips and a $104 million charge related to ending a joint
venture with Toshiba to produce memory chips in the United States.
It also took a $208 million charge to cover the cost of moving hard
disk manufacturing plants to low-wage areas like Hungary and
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In an accounting change, IBM took a $241 million charge to write
off the value of personal computers that IBM owns for its internal
use. The company now plans to replace its own PC's every three
years, rather than every five years as it had before.
</P>
<P>
   The company noted that about $3 billion _ or 14 percent _ of its
sales in the quarter came over the Internet, a 10-fold increase
over a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The company announced its earnings after the close of stock
trading.Its shares fell on Monday by $1.625 to end the day at
$134.625 on the New York Stock Exchange.

MICROSOFT SAYS PROFITS INCREASED 60 PERCENT IN 2ND QUARTER
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With its business surging on several fronts, the Microsoft Corp.
reported on Monday that its quarterly profits increased more than
60 percent in the quarter ended June 30, exceeding analyst
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft, the world's leading maker of computer software,
also warned that the growth of its business was likely to slow in
the next year. The company said it expected the recent torrid
demand for personal computers would ease and that spending on
software would slow as companies focus instead on dealing with the
Year 2000 problem confronting their computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft reported its results after the close of the stock
market on Monday. Its share price fell $1.0625 a share, to $98.375
in regular trading; in after-hours trading, shares declined further
to about $97.60.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with analysts, Greg Maffei, Microsoft's
chief financial officer, said he expected that the company's
revenue, which rose 29 percent in the last 12 months, to show a
percentage gain in the ``high teens'' during the next year.
Earnings growth for the coming year, he suggested, would probably
be in the ``high single-digit'' range.
</P>
<P>
   Maffei declined to comment on recent reports that Microsoft is
about to establish a ``tracking'' stock linked to its World Wide
Web sites, except to say that the company had been considering that
option in recent months. ``We're looking at it, but no announcement
is imminent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft reported profits of $2.2 billion for the quarter, or
40 cents a share. That was easily more than the consensus among
analysts of 36 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as its business has powered ahead, especially in the last
two years, Microsoft has made a ritual of announcing remarkable
financial results that surpass analysts' expectations _ then
cautioning that tougher times lie ahead. Yesterday was no
exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're telling them that this quarter is not necessarily
indicative of future results,'' Maffei said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   One particular nonindicator, Maffei said, was the growth of 39
percent in revenue during the quarter, to $5.76 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Without a series of nonrecurring items _ notably, accounting
changes to recognize software revenues more quickly _ the revenue
growth would have been only 26 percent for the quarter, he noted.
Still, because of a handful of one-time charges, the higher revenue
did not inflate the quarterly earnings numbers.
</P>
<P>
   One accounting item, however, did underline the continuing
change in Microsoft's business model. More of its revenues now come
from licensing fees collected from PC makers and corporate clients,
while packaged sales of software become less important. Thus,
Microsoft reduced its estimate of the future cost of handling
unsold software products returned by retailers. The result of the
changed assumption was to increase revenue by $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very robust quarter for Microsoft,'' said Rick
Sherlund, an analyst for Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. ``And I did not hear
any extraordinary concerns beyond the cautionary tone the company
usually takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Sherlund said that Wall Street was expecting Microsoft's
growth for fiscal 2000, which begins this month, to slow down _ for
the very reasons enumerated by the company.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's quarterly performance was led by particularly strong
sales of its new Office 2000 productivity suite, which includes
word processing, spreadsheet and data-base programs. Sales of its
productivity applications and related products grow 48 percent in
the quarter, to $2.93 billion, accounting for more than half of
Microsoft's revenue. That business also includes applications that
run on hub computers, or servers, like its data-base product,
Microsoft SQL Server.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's sales in Asia, including Japan and South Korea, rose
53 percent to $570 million in the quarter, reflecting the economic
recovery in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Maffei suggested that the performance of the company's Internet
businesses was improving considerably. Microsoft has a reputation
for spending heavily on its Internet sites like MSN.com, Expedia
and others without generating the level of revenue of its leading
online rivals.
</P>
<P>
   But Maffei spoke pointedly of Microsoft's ``improved ability to
monetize our Web traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   He mentioned, for example, that its Expedia travel service was
now generating weekly sales of $16 million, on which Microsoft
collects a small commission in addition to the revenue it garners
from advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft expects the advertising revenue from its World Wide
Web sites to increase 75 percent in the next year, Maffie said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When Hillary Rodham Clinton gave a baby shower at the White
House last summer for Mandy Grunwald, it was an event that prompted
one of Ms. Grunwald's friends, the USA Today columnist Walter
Shapiro, to observe that ``the kid may have peaked too soon.''
</P>
<P>
   The kid is now 9-month-old Benjamin. And Ms. Grunwald, who
herself had a peak at the age of 34 when she took on Ted Koppel and
defended the Clintons on ``Nightline'' _ only to be cast out as a
White House adviser by the president in 1995 _ is back, helping the
first lady with her pre-campaign for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Her job? ``Right now, I do whatever I'm asked,'' Ms. Grunwald
said carefully over lunch last week at the Four Seasons Hotel in
Washington, where she had Oriental chicken salad while her beeper
and cell phone lay expectantly on the table.
</P>
<P>
   That included calling Elizabeth Moynihan, the wife of the
retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan to ask if the Moynihans'
800-acre farm might be available for the start of Mrs. Clinton's
summer ``listening tour'' in New York. The Moynihans are longtime
friends of Ms. Grunwald, who made the television commercials for
three of Moynihan's campaigns. Ms. Grunwald was also the Harvard
roommate of the Moynihans' daughter, Maura.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Mandy's idea to start with Pat, and do it at the
farm,'' Mrs. Moynihan said, although it was Mrs. Moynihan's idea to
have her husband and Mrs. Clinton walk down the sylvan country road
toward the press for the passing-of-the-torch photograph that was
in newspapers worldwide the next morning. Ms. Grunwald stayed at
the Moynihans' farmhouse the night before, then slipped out on the
porch early the next day with Mrs. Moynihan _ both were in their
nightgowns _ to spy the satellite trucks in the hayfield.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Grunwald was the shared adviser and crucial link to two
political families often at odds with each other in Washington, but
who seem to have united in the interest of getting a Democrat
elected to the Senate from New York. (Moynihan criticized portions
of the health care plan Mrs. Clinton promoted during her husband's
first term; now Ms. Grunwald says their relationship is more
``professor-student.'')
</P>
<P>
   So for now, Ms. Grunwald has one of the most coveted jobs in
politics, although she will be fending off rival Democrats
second-guessing what will likely be the most heavily advised
campaign in New York history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we have a pretty good group making the decisions,''
Ms. Grunwald said. ``I think as we go along, other people will be
added.'' The inner group includes Ms. Grunwald; Harold Ickes, the
former White House deputy chief of staff; Mark Penn, the pollster;
and Howard Wolfson, Mrs. Clinton's exploratory committee press
secretary. All live in Washington, but all are former New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   People describe Ms. Grunwald, 41, as smart, tough, gruff,
intensely loyal to her candidates, with an air of superiority and
great certainty. As her sister, Lisa, a novelist, wrote in Glamour
magazine four years ago: ``She was older. Braver. Taller. Meaner.
Stronger.'' Still, Ms. Grunwald is generally thought to have
softened since the birth of her son and her marriage to Matt
Cooper, a stand-up comic, formerly of Newsweek but soon to be a
writer for Time magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as having a different personality since she married me,
I've heard people say that, but to me, she's always been a softy,''
Cooper said. ``She wept at the Lion King. She cries during AT&AMP;T
ads.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Grunwald was in any case on good behavior during lunch,
although working hard to keep the focus on her candidate. ``A lot
of profiles don't know what to do with the religion in her life,''
Ms. Grunwald said. ``If you're doing the yuppie-cliche profile,
religion doesn't fit, but it's a big part of her life.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the New Yorkers surrounding Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Grunwald had
the snazziest childhood, even more so than Ickes, whose father
advised Franklin D. Roosevelt. Ms. Grunwald's father is Henry
Grunwald, a Republican, the former editor of Time and later the
ambassador to Austria under President Ronald Reagan. Her mother,
Beverly Grunwald, a Democrat and a columnist for Women's Wear
Daily, died of breast cancer when Ms. Grunwald was 23.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Grunwald grew up on the Upper East Side and Martha's
Vineyard, went to the Nightingale-Bamford School, made the dinner
party place cards for family friends like Mike Wallace and Barbara
Walters, and reveled in the action at home. ``It actually was a
great childhood for what I'm doing, because nobody intimidates
you,'' Ms. Grunwald said.
</P>
<P>
   After Harvard, Ms. Grunwald went to work in New York for the
Sawyer-Miller Group, then a political consulting firm. She moved to
Washington in 1991 to work for Frank Greer, a political consultant
who would soon advise an Arkansas governor running for President.
In the 1992 campaign, Ms. Grunwald took on Ted Koppel during the
Gennifer Flowers scandal and was hired immediately by the Clintons,
but was then supplanted as a presidential adviser, along with
others, by Dick Morris in 1995. Still, she stayed close to the
first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Grunwald often says she got her job with the Clintons
through Koppel.
</P>
<P>
   ``She silenced'' him, her sister wrote, ``with the same look I'd
first seen at the age of 4, when we shared a bath and I used the
shampoo first.''

U.S. RAISES TAX ON FOOD FROM EUROPE IN DISPUTE OVER BEEF
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By DAVID STOUT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the latest round of a continuing dispute with
Europe, the United States on Monday imposed tariffs intended to
double the price of imports as familiar as Dijon mustard from
France and as obscure as the ``guts, bladders and stomachs of
animals (other than fish), whole and pieces thereof.''
</P>
<P>
   The tariffs, announced by the deputy trade representative, Peter
Scher, had been expected. They will take effect on July 29 and are
intended to cover $116.8 million in annual imports, almost all of
it food, from members of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. trade officials were reacting to a European Union ban on
U.S. beef treated with growth hormones. The World Trade
Organization, which sets rules for global commerce, declared last
week that the European ban was unjustified because there was no
scientific evidence of a health danger linked to hormone-treated
beef.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like nothing better than getting to a negotiated
settlement,'' Scher said. ``Retaliation doesn't solve the
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The penalties announced Monday do not cover two popular products
that had been considered for high tariffs: Evian and Perrier
mineral water, both imported from France.
</P>
<P>
   Pork products make up the biggest category subject to the
tariffs. Other foods include Roquefort cheese, truffles, chocolate
and lingonberry and raspberry jams. There are two nonfood products
on the list: yarn and glue products, both from France and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Britain is exempt from the tariff sanctions because British
officials support the U.S. position that the ban on beef should be
lifted, Scher said.
</P>
<P>
   Scher said the list of products to be penalized was intended to
inflict the most economic damage on France, Germany, Italy and
Denmark. France and Germany each account for 24 percent of the
imports to be affected; Italy, 21 percent, and Denmark, 15 percent.
Therefore, he said, they have the most incentive to get the
European ban on U.S. beef overturned.
</P>
<P>
   The products facing the punitive action are subject to few if
any tariffs now, Scher said, adding that Washington is not really
interested in the revenue that higher tariffs might generate.
``That doesn't help the American beef farmers,'' he said. ``We
don't want to force the Europeans to buy our beef. We just want the
right to sell to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Scher said his office considered comments from American
retailers and the effect on American consumers in compiling the
list of foods subject to the tariffs. Scher said he would rather
see European exporters get discouraged and press the European Union
to relent on U.S. beef than have Americans pay more at the grocery
store.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Clinton administration drew up a
preliminary list of $900 million worth of European items that could
be subjected to tariffs but cut the list to $116.8 million after
the World Trade Organization estimated that the amount was what the
beef ban was costing U.S. beef producers. The American beef
industry has said its annual losses from the decade-old ban are
much higher than that.

<P>
   He didn't want to leave when he was a free agent after the 1995
season, he didn't want to leave after last season and he doesn't
plan to leave after this season. Everything might be up to date in
Kansas City, where he grew up, but for David Cone, New York is the
only place to play major league baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four hours after he completed his perfect game against
the Montreal Expos, Cone was back at the same microphone at Yankee
Stadium on Monday talking about his performance, his experience and
his infatuation with the city, where most players would rather not
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to go anywhere else,'' the Yankees' star pitcher
said, explaining why he settled for a one-year contract with the
Yankees last winter when he was a free agent. ``I just couldn't
leave. I've pitched most of my career in New York. I had a chance
probably to go somewhere else, maybe on the West Coast, and get a
three-year deal, but I just couldn't do it. I'm pretty happy I
signed that one-year deal after yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are more than pretty happy he agreed to that deal.
They are ecstatic that they even offered it to him. Cone has been
the Yankees' best pitcher this season, with a 10-4 record and a
2.65 earned run average. Still, in the off season there was some
hesitation in the organization to sign him because he didn't finish
the year strong enough to convince the Yankees that he could make
it through another full season.
</P>
<P>
   Cone, always realistic and candid, readily admitted that he
understood the doubts that existed because he said he had his own
doubts about himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of self-doubt in the off season, mainly because of
my last two starts in the playoffs,'' he said. ``Cleveland banged
me around in Game 6; Thome hit the grand slam. I really seemed to
fade in that game. The San Diego game, even though I pitched fairly
well, I could feel more pain than usual after the game. It was a
long, hard season, and it kind of caught up with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the questions he and the Yankees had, other teams were
ready to jump in if he became a free agent. Other teams were
forbidden from talking to Cone at that stage, but enough talk
circulated in baseball circles that Cone was aware he could have
had his pick of perhaps a half-dozen teams with a two-year or
three-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he eschewed free agency and signed a one-year deal that
pays him an $8 million salary and a bonus of $100,000 a start for
15 starts beginning with his 17th.
</P>
<P>
   The perfect game was start No. 18, meaning he earned $100,000,
although he would have gained the same $100,000 if he had been
knocked out in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, his two big free-agent contracts were three years
for $18 million (Kansas City) and three years for $19.5 million
(Yankees). In December 1995, before he signed to stay in New York,
the Baltimore Orioles were hot for his right arm. They might have
been able to lure him away from New York, but they didn't act
quickly enough. George Steinbrenner stepped in with his offer of a
no-trade clause, and Cone said, ``Where do I sign?''
</P>
<P>
   So why New York?
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there's always a chance to have a day like yesterday,''
he said Monday. ``I know that if you do it here, it's more
significant. I got a chance to pitch on Yogi Berra Day. I've had a
few of those days. I pitched the day Mickey Mantle died. I pitched
on Joe DiMaggio Day. As I warmed up in center field, Paul Simon
sang his tribute to Joe D.
</P>
<P>
   ``That just doesn't happen anywhere else. You can't help but get
caught up in that.''
</P>
<P>
   Because he only has a one-year contract, Cone can again be a
free agent after this season. His agent, Steve Fehr, shouldn't
bother looking elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he thought would happen contractually with the
Yankees this winter, he said: ``I don't know. I don't really care.
It's definitely not important to me. I've said all along I'm
willing to go year by year at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Much, he added, will depend on how he performs the rest of the
season and in the post-season. ``Everybody wants to see how I do in
September, how I hold up,'' said Cone, 36. ``Those are valid
questions. I don't get offended by those types of questions. I'm
anxious to see myself how I hold up down the stretch and if we get
in the playoffs, how I pitch in the playoffs. What you do down the
stretch and what you do in the post-season determines your fate in
New York.''
</P>
<P>
   After his hometown Kansas City Royals traded him to the Mets,
Cone basically began his career in New York, spending nearly six
seasons at Shea Stadium. He thought about those years on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about near misses on no-hitters earlier in his career,
Cone said: ``It's been a big disappointment to me. With the Mets, I
had a chance to be the first one to throw one for the Mets. It's
kind of ironic sitting over here as a Yankee talking about it.'' &QL;

CALL MADE ABOUT KENNEDY PLANE 25 MINUTES AFTER PRESUMED CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (With Kennedy-Call-Text)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An employee of Martha's Vineyard Airport alerted federal
aviation officials that John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane was unaccounted
for nearly four hours before a phone call from a Kennedy family
friend early Saturday morning triggered a massive air and sea
search.
</P>
<P>
   The first phone call _ which cited Kennedy by name _ prompted no
action by the Federal Aviation Administration. It was made at 10:05
p.m. Friday, only 25 minutes after Kennedy's plane was lost on
radar and presumably crashed into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, Kennedy Jr.'s on board. He's, uh, they wanna know,
uh, where he is,'' Adam Budd told an unidentified FAA employee at
the Bridgeport Automated Flight Service Station.
</P>
<P>
   Until the plane is found, there is no way to say whether an
earlier search would have made a difference in the survival chances
of Kennedy, his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, or her sister,
Lauren Bessette.
</P>
<P>
   However, a transcript of Budd's call, obtained by the Globe,
adds fuel to questions about whether the FAA responded as promptly
as it should have, and as quickly as its own regulations specify,
to concerns about Kennedy's missing plane.
</P>
<P>
   FAA officials said they responded appropriately to the call.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've researched the matter and found the FAA was not told
that the aircraft was overdue, or that there was any indication
there was a problem or a cause for concern that would raise warning
flags,'' said Eliot Brenner, a senior FAA spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was flying to Martha's Vineyard to drop off Lauren
Bessette, after which he planned to fly to Hyannis to attend the
wedding of his cousin Rory Kennedy. A well-dressed couple with a
child who had come to the airport to meet Lauren Bessette grew
concerned when the plane did not arrive as expected by 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   They sought help from Budd, 21, a Bridgwater State College
student from Sharon, Mass. In a telephone interview Monday night,
Budd said he is also a licensed pilot who has worked for the past
month as a ramp attendant at the airstrip.
</P>
<P>
   Budd said he first called the airport tower, but was told
Kennedy's plane was not expected _ Kennedy had filed no flight plan
_ and that it had made no radio contact.
</P>
<P>
   Budd then called the FAA outpost in Bridgeport, Conn., which is
a repository for flight plans and also provides pilots with weather
information and notices about flight restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   During his conversation with the unidentified FAA employee, Budd
asked if the FAA could track an airplane. Budd said he was with
airport operations at Martha's Vineyard, then mentioned Kennedy's
name and provided two possible aircraft numbers for Kennedy's
plane.
</P>
<P>
   The employee questioned Budd repeatedly about who he was and
where he was calling from. After Budd gave his name, the FAA
employee asked if he was, in fact, with airport operations. He
ultimately told Budd, ``We don't give this information out to
people over the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point Budd gave up, saying, ``I'll just have 'em wait,''
and then, ``All right, it's no big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Budd said the transcript tells only part of
the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to hear his tone of voice, because the guy was kind
of rude to me, making me feel uncomfortable,'' he said. ``I've
called before and they were happy to help me out. The guy might
have been having a bad day or something. I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Brenner, the FAA spokesman, said the problem with the tone was
Budd's. ``There was no tone of concern in the voice or anything out
of the ordinary,'' Brenner said. ``There needed to be some
expression that this airplane is overdue.''
</P>
<P>
   No action was taken until a 2:15 a.m. Saturday phone call from
Carol Ratowell, a Kennedy family friend. Her call to the Coast
Guard set in motion the multiagency search that began with calls to
airports around the region and officially became a
search-and-rescue mission at 3:28 a.m.

<P>
   PARIS _ Anyone who thinks that the semiannual made-to-measure
collections are about $20,000 silk dresses doesn't understand haute
couture. Between the big shows, which are timed so as not to
interfere with the life of fashion _ the gossiping and the
eyeballing of the noonday crowd at the Ritz bar, which is like
information central _ there is the inevitable round of parties.
</P>
<P>
   The lunch Hubert and Isabelle d'Ornano gave Monday for the
designer Emanuel Ungaro in their elegant Left Bank apartment looked
like a family reunion, and in a way it was. Many of the guests,
including Nan Kempner, Betsy Bloomingdale, Deeda Blair and Susan
Gutfreund, have been seeing a good deal of one another this week,
whether in the front row at the Ungaro show or Sunday at the
Valentino and Givenchy shows or at the dinner Giancarlo Giammetti
gave at his apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Giammetti, who is Valentino's business partner, understands the
life. He lives it, and as a result, he can't help observing _ even
wanting to preserve _ the hierarchy, the status quo that means
nothing to the outside world and everything to couture, even down
to the meaning of who's eating lunch with whom in the garden of the
Ritz.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, then, the 300 women who regularly pay upwards of
$15,000 for a suit (and much more for an evening dress) are like a
family whose role has been inflated by money and social prestige.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's the friends,'' Mrs. Kempner said as she breezed
into the d'Ornanos' scented entrance hall with Mrs. Bloomingdale.
``And I love to see the clothes.'' She added, somewhat
competitively, ``You've got to get here early for the models.'' By
this she meant the samples that are made for the runway, which, as
any rail-thin denizen of haute couture knows, are half price.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Madonna, Sean (Puffy) Combs and the artist
formerly known as Prince were seated front and center at Donatella
Versace's show was a sign that Ms. Versace, the original
bottle-blonde Medusa, has returned to her glam-rock roots.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, she fell into the art-school trap of thinking that
materials like stingray skin and banana leaves were intelligently
modern, forgetting that women who pay these prices react to
something that's beautiful, not recently harpooned. In this
fast-paced show, set to music by Boy George, Ms. Versace sent out
gold-studded boot-leg trousers with tight, cropped jackets and
skirts of stiff gold and tan embossed leather paired with stiletto
python boots and spare tops swinging with gold-beaded fringe.
</P>
<P>
   The show had a hard, sexy drive, with dollops of flaming Lolita
pink. A knee-length coat made of horizontal stripes of netting and
rose-dyed mink caught the right funky note.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much of my personality went into the collection,'' Ms.
Versace said at the post-show party. She was sitting at a table
with Madonna, who is in Europe with her daughter on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I craved several outfits for myself, and if I see anyone else
in them, I'm going to kill them,'' Madonna said, laughing. ``I'm a
big fan of that pink rabbit coat.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Versace shot her a wise-guy look. ``It was mink,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the star just laughed and said, ``I don't know fur. I'm from
Detroit.''
</P>
<P>
   Since taking up couture a couple of years ago, Jean Paul
Gaultier has proven, with cheeky savoir faire, to be a modern
couturier _ and now he has aligned with Hermes, which recently
bought a stake in his business. But the collection he presented on
Sunday was heavy going, as models came out in sweaters beaded with
tweedy dots, long coats trimmed with feathers or with an attached
zippered vest, down-filled wraps and long gloves with built-in
leather jewels and a wrist pad for taking notes.
</P>
<P>
   There were some beautiful elements, like a sage top knitted with
feathers that just shrugged over the shoulders with tight crocodile
pants, and a flimsy lavender velvet top with some black beaded
pants that were really more like pantyhose attached to boots. But
while something like a salt-and-pepper suit made of layers of
feathers showed off the skill of his workrooms, Gaultier's clothes
often seemed burdened by the traditions of couture rather than
liberated by them.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander McQueen's show for Givenchy, which was inspired by a
1833 painting called ``Execution of Lady Jane Grey,'' was a tour de
something, all right. It was mesmerizing, maddening, and it left
more than a few people wondering if it was McQueen who had lost his
head. In the first place, he showed the collection on mannequins
that rose up at intervals through squares in the floor. Second, a
lot of the clothes looked like museum pieces: a fluffy
cream-colored coat embroidered with gold squares that framed crowns
and embroidered field flowers, a bouffant tartan skirt with a
bolero of feathers worked in a tartan pattern and fur-trimmed
tunics straight out of 16th-century England.
</P>
<P>
   Yet who can deny that this is what couture is _ the exceptional,
one-of-a kind creation? ``I designed that collection when I was
going through quite an emotional turmoil in my life, both
professionally and personally,'' McQueen said backstage. He added,
with some satisfaction, ``It's a good thing for the end of the
century.''
</P>
<P>
   If ever there was an incurable romantic, it is Emanuel Ungaro.
He can't resist the image of women as wispy figures floating
through a well-appointed cosmos of men and money, femmes fatales
who love gypsy layers of tulle, with feathers and leopard-spotted
fur rising seductively around their throats. You'd like to wring
them sometimes. But Ungaro's eye for color _ those deep reds, leafy
browns and dusty pinks _ is exquisite. And here and there were
pieces his loyal customers will know how to sort out, like a
beaded-chiffon gown with an inset of lace quivering over the bosom,
or a pale pink and lavender shell knitted in a crazy effect with
tiny feathers. They'll skip the ball skirt it was shown with and go
with a pair of gray trousers.
</P>
<P>
   To watch a Valentino show is to imagine what you'd like to be in
your next life: tall, skinny and born with a wiggle. But don't
think this collection was not for modern-thinking women, and in a
way, after the Givenchy show, it was as leveling as a glass of
Scotch. Here was a slim, silvery gray pants suit over a pin-tucked
white blouse, there a loose black top winking over a bare midriff
artfully covered with nude-colored tulle etched with embroidery.
Beading swished from the hems of trousers; dark green lace was
worked over sky blue silk.
</P>
<P>
   It was a sleek, modern collection, not the least because
Valentino ended with variations on the little black dress, as if to
say, ``What more do you want?''

ADVERTISING: ACQUISITIONS ALL THE RAGE IN MARKETING 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ More agencies and agency companies are agreeing to
deals to sell full or partial control to larger firms, as the
acquisition boom remaking Madison Avenue continues.
</P>
<P>
   In several instances, the deals involve shops that specialize in
marketing services apart from traditional advertising tasks like
creating television commercials and print advertisements. Spending
for those services, which include direct marketing, sales promotion
and interactive marketing, has been growing faster than their more
familiar counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Lopex PLC, a marketing services agency in London,
has agreed to be sold to Havas Advertising in Paris for $105
million in cash. Lopex owns agencies that specialize in services
like advertising, direct marketing, research, public relations and
design.
</P>
<P>
   The Havas offer for Lopex beat an all-stock offer from the
Incepta Group in London, which owns 29.9 percent of Lopex along
with a company called Southwind Ltd. Havas, which owns agencies
like Euro RSCG Worldwide, is paying about $1.88 for each share of
Lopex, 54 percent more than the closing price on July 1, the day
before the offer from Incepta. As of Friday, Havas had bought 50.1
percent of the shares.
</P>
<P>
   Incepta, which also operates marketing services and public
relations agencies, said it would let its hostile bid lapse in
light of the Havas offer.
</P>
<P>
   The Lopex deal came less than a week after Euro RSCG combined
its worldwide marketing services operations into a unit called the
Sales Machine, a network of 76 agencies with 1,600 employees in 40
countries working for clients including Dell Computer, Intel and
Peugeot. That unit is already landing additional assignments; the
Euro RSCG Tatham Sales Machine in Chicago has been named primary
agency of record for marketing services and point-of-sale
advertising for Midas Inc.
</P>
<P>
   In other deals:
</P>
<P>
   Agency.com in New York continued its European expansion by
taking what was described as a significant minority stake in
Pictoris Interactive SA in Paris, a leading French interactive
agency with clients including Accor, Groupe Danone and Lotus. Terms
were not disclosed. Pictoris has been working with Agency.com on
projects since earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Medicus Group International in New York, part of MacManus Group,
acquired Healthtech Solutions, an information technology and
educational services consulting company in St. Louis with clients
like Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn. Terms were not
disclosed. Healthtech will operate as an independent unit of the
Discovery Global Medical Communications Group of Medicus.
</P>
<P>
   WPP Group in London, which owns agencies including Ogilvy &AMP;
Mather Worldwide and J. Walter Thompson, acquired PFour
Consultancy, a London-based company with revenue of $5.2 million.
PFour advises financial service marketers on issues like sales
force reorganization and partnerships. Terms were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Lighthouse Holdings Inc. in Chicago, continuing its effort to
acquire marketing companies, agreed to buy Davidson Marketing in
Chicago. Terms were not disclosed. Davidson, with clients including
Keebler and Microsoft, will operate as a stand-alone unit of
Lighthouse.
</P>
<P>
   And Cordiant Communications Group PLC in London acquired a
majority stake in Bates Clarion Ltd., an agency with offices in
Bombay, Calcutta and Delhi, India, and annual revenue of about $2.3
million from clients including Nokia and Warner-Lambert. Terms were
not disclosed. Bates Clarion previously had a nonequity affiliation
with the Bates Worldwide unit of Cordiant.

   Following is a transcript of a telephone exchange between
Martha's Vineyard Airport and the Bridgeport Automated Flight
Service Station (ATCS) Friday at 10:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ATCS: Good evening, Bridgeport Flight Service.

   BEIRUT _ Khanjar Shaeb was studying at the Beirut Baptist School
when he was seized by Israel's surrogate South Lebanon Army (SLA)
militia in 1996. He is still in their notorious Khiam prison in
southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Now 19, he has passed two birthdays in the old French mandate
fort where Israel keeps its ``bargaining chips'' _ read hostages _
for its captured soldiers and airmen in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   After he dug a hole in the wall of the prison in a vain escape
attempt, offering to take on his back a crippled prisoner who had
his leg amputated in the jail because of gangrene, Khanjar Shaeb
was recaptured and _ according to newly released inmates _ beaten.
</P>
<P>
   He spent a week in Marjayoun Hospital inside the Israeli
occupation zone.
</P>
<P>
   Shaeb is only one of the Khiam prisoners who are victims of a
new regime of violence and torture at the jail, which even SLA men
fear.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese government has complained to the U.N. about six
detainees who were allegedly assaulted with hammers by SLA guards
this month when they planned a hunger strike.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan Seayad, 70 _ the ``grandfather of Khiam,'' according to
the one-legged prisoner Sulieman Ramadan _ was released a few days
ago with appalling stories of being chained and hung by his arms
from a roof beam.
</P>
<P>
   Ramadan has been in Khiam without trial for 14 years. His
70-year-old wife remains a prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli courts are now debating whether Israel actually controls
the Khiam jail, which lies inside its occupation zone, arguing
whether the Israeli army _ which arms, clothes, trains and pays the
SLA _ actually runs the jail.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials have stated that the inmates are ``bargaining
chips'' for missing Israelis and there will be no trials.
</P>
<P>
   While some of the prisoners have been captured while attacking
Israeli occupation troops _ which is not a crime under
international law _ others are clearly no more than kidnap victims.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after Khanjar Shaeb was arrested, the SLA detained the
children of two of his neighbors and his two cousins.
</P>
<P>
   Torture has long been a feature of Khiam. Its ``electrical
room,'' where electrodes were applied to the fingers and penises of
prisoners under interrogation since 1985, has been described by
many former inmates. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch
have been refused access to the jail.
</P>
<P>
   Old Hassan Seayad emerged to tell how he was suspended from a
pole from a ceiling bar so that his arms almost broke. ``My armpits
hurt so much and I kept trying to reach the ground. I had to answer
back and every time I did, I was beaten,'' he said. He then kept
his mouth shut for fear that his wife would be tortured. &QL;

   Sohad Shaeb tells the story of her son's arrest with painful
irony _ the family home is in Khiam village, only a few hundred
meters from the prison that still carries the shell holes of the
Allied Australian troops who liberated Lebanon from the Vichy
French in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had gone to Beirut in 1996 to see my brother off to
Germany,'' Sohad Shaeb said. ``On Sept. 1, 1996 I telephoned my
parents, who were looking after Khanjar, to tell him to follow us.
When he didn't turn up, I called them and they said that the SLA
had taken him that morning. We found out later that he had been
taken to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I returned to Khiam and a week later, as I was sitting on the
rooftop of our home, I saw an SLA convoy speeding past. I felt
Khanjar was in one of the cars _ I felt that my heart jumped out
and followed the cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when I approached one of the guards, whom I knew, and said
Khanjar had arrived at the jail, he asked, `How did you know he was
here?' I didn't see him until the Red Cross arranged for a visit.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, the SLA arrested Sohad Shaeb and placed her in
solitary confinement in the same prison. &QL;

<P>
   The Israelis rarely disclose why their proxy militia have
arrested men or women in southern Lebanon _ a difficult task since
many have been arrested because of the politics of their family.
</P>
<P>
   Sohad Shaeb says she suspects her son was detained because his
stepbrother is a Beirut government bodyguard for Nabi Berri, the
speaker of the Lebanese parliament and leader of the anti-Israeli
Amal militia. &QL;

   She herself was accused under interrogation of transporting
weapons. ``But I said to them, `How could I move weapons in the
family car _ especially when you SLA people search the car at every
checkpoint?' They kept insulting me until I shouted at them to be
polite.'' She was released without explanation on Oct. 3, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Khanjar Shaeb remains the youngest prisoner in Khiam and _ by
his mother's account _ a tough one. Khanjar means ``knife.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first saw him, I cried and called him `my darling' and
he said that if I cried he would ask the guards to take him away.
He said, `I promise you I have done nothing wrong. You must be
strong. I'm not afraid because I haven't done anything wrong.' The
International Red Cross take Khanjar books, and in a letter to him
I wrote to say he must ask for a dictionary and English books to
continue his education. Prisoners who've been released say he has
taught them English _ he's very, very intelligent.'' &QL;

   At least 170 Lebanese remain in Israeli prisons _ 128 in Khiam

international law.
</P>
<P>
   Until the creation of the Association for Lebanese Detainees _
originally organized by a Lebanese who had spent years in Ashkelon
prison for gunrunning into the occupied West Bank _ the Lebanese
government ignored their prisoners in Israeli hands.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, they received the support of the Lebanese prime
minister and the country's former foreign minister, Fares Boueiz,
who is making international appeals for their release. &QL;

   The SLA has problems of its own. Faced with an apparently
imminent Israeli military retreat from southern Lebanon, it is
aware that dozens of SLA men who handed themselves over to the
Lebanese authorities after the Israelis withdrew from the city of
Jezzine last month were imprisoned by the Beirut government and
accused of ``collaboration with the enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   So fearful was one of the SLA officers there of his Israeli
sponsors that when journalists asked to enter Jezzine before the
Israeli retreat, he replied: ``I'd help you (but) they'll put me in
Khiam.''
</P>
<P>
   In Damascus, meanwhile, the justice minister, Hussein Hassoun,
has announced the impending release of _ according to the Syrian
government newspaper Tishrin _ ``tens of thousands of prisoners,''
including those guilty of military desertion, smuggling and other
economic crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International has long called for the release of
``political prisoners'' by Syria. The releases were granted under

JAPAN'S NEW CONSUL GENERAL TO KANSAS CITY SETTLING INTO HIS JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 CHARLES R.T. CRUMPLEY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Japan's new consul general to Kansas City,
Toshiyuki Fujiwara, is settling into his new job here with a vow to
meet as many people as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting people has become an important new role for Japanese
consuls general everywhere because they want to promote cultural,
social, political and economic ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is most important to have good relations with my area,''
Fujiwara said in an interview Monday. His area comprises the states
of Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa and both Dakotas.
</P>
<P>
   The consulate is the regional embassy and the consul general is
Japan's ambassador to this region. In emphasizing social and
cultural contacts with Americans, Fujiwara won't ignore the
consulate's traditional role of looking out for the interests of
Japanese businesses and Japanese people in this region.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to know what U.S. people are thinking so I can report
back to my home government,'' Fujiwara said from the consul's
residence near Ward Parkway.
</P>
<P>
   Japan in recent years has shown keen interest in learning what
Americans are thinking. In April, Japan opened its 16th consulate
office in Denver, making its number of consulates in the United
States one of the highest among countries. The Kansas City
consulate opened in 1979. Japan's main embassy is in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Fujiwara, who arrived a month ago, replaces Tatsuo Tanaka, who
had served in Kansas City for three years. Tanaka and his wife,
Eri, were accomplished at meeting people and making ties. Tatsuo
Tanaka explained Japanese policies in letters to the editor, for
example, while Eri Tanaka demonstrated ikebana, the Japanese art of
flower arranging. They also promoted Japanese arts.
</P>
<P>
   They gained popularity among the influential; U.S. Rep. Karen
McCarthy, D-Mo., and banker R. Crosby Kemper Jr. were among those
who attended the Tanakas' sayonara party in the spring. Since then,
Tanaka was named as Japan's ambassador to Papua New Guinea.
</P>
<P>
   Fujiwara, 59, was born near Hiroshima. When the atomic bomb was
dropped there in 1945, he and his family were in Manchuria, where
his father, an airplane engineer, was stationed. After the war,
young Fujiwara was impressed with daily newspaper accounts of
President Harry S. Truman and Gen. Douglas MacArthur, who led the
occupying military forces in Japan. Fujiwara decided then to become
a politician or a diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would think 50 years later I'd be posted in Missouri, near
Truman's hometown?'' Fujiwara said.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from law school in Keio University, he became a
diplomat. He has been stationed in such places as Toronto and
Washington, but he has spent 14 years in Turkey. He considers
Turkish his second language, English his third.
</P>
<P>
   He enjoys listening to classical music and playing golf. ``The
U.S. is paradise for golfing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fujiwara says he likes the States but has difficulty with
American food. He brought a cook from Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise, I may have some difficulty staying here,'' he said
with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Fujiwara's wife, Hideko, remains in Japan, where she is caring
for her parents and planning the December wedding of the Fujiwaras'
28-year-old daughter, Miki. Their other daughter, Aki, 24, is
visiting Kansas City now but will return to Japan shortly.

CHARLES ROMAN, AD MAN FOR CHARLES ATLAS, DIES AT 92
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Fla.)   (jw) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles Roman, the not particularly husky ad man and executive
who created classic advertisements for the bodybuilder Charles
Atlas, including the one about a 97-pound weakling, died on Friday
at Mount Sinai Medical Center. He was 92 and lived in the Chelsea
section of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Roman did much to gain fame for the once-skinny Atlas, born
Angelo Siciliano in Brooklyn, for whom the Charles Atlas
bodybuilding course is named. Atlas has been called the Horatio
Alger of the human body. After Atlas died in Florida in 1972, still
a fine figure of a man at 78, Roman labored for years in his
Manhattan office to keep the Charles Atlas legend going.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Atlas Ltd., of which Roman was president from 1929 until
1997, still sells its series of mail-order lessons about what it
sometimes calls its exercise and healthy-living program.
</P>
<P>
   The ``97-pound weakling'' ad that Roman devised relatively early
in his career was built around a phrase he coined that became an
enduring metaphor for puniness and humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   The ad was based on an encounter that Atlas himself had
experienced while he was still a skinny youth. Roman's ad consisted
of several panels in comic-book format. They told the tale of the
97-pound weakling, a boy named Mac, who was humiliated by a bully
while at the beach with his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   The 97-pound weakling ad has varied somewhat over the years, but
the company's current owner, Jeffrey Hogue, said that in its most
widely used form, the weakling, known as Mac, and his girlfriend
had sand kicked in their faces by a beach bully. The ad is entitled
``The Insult that Made a Man out of Mac.''
</P>
<P>
   Mac loses the girlfriend, sees the light and decides to get the
Charles Atlas program. Before long he looks in the mirror and says,
``Boy! Look how those muscles bulge!'' And in the last frame he
punches the bully while the girlfriend watches _ and is impressed.
</P>
<P>
   Besides advertising and administrative duties for the Charles
Atlas system, which he named Dynamic-Tension, Roman did public
relations work for Charles Atlas. One busy day, after Atlas had
used his extraordinary physique to break a metal bar before an
audience of 3,000 convicts, Roman telephoned tabloid newspapers and
suggested a headline: ``Man Breaks Bar at Sing Sing Prison _
Thousands Cheer, None Escape.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1928, Roman was a fledgling $35-a-week account executive at
the Benjamin Landsman Advertising Agency in New York when he met
Atlas, a champion bodybuilder whose business was relatively puny at
the time. Roman told Atlas that the advertising he had been using
was not working. Months afterward, Roman became Atlas' partner in
their new company, Charles Atlas Ltd. Roman went on to become the
sole owner in 1969 and sold the enterprise to Hogue in 1997 but he
maintained an influence on its operations until his death.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Charles Atlas Ltd. has also turned to
manufacturing vitamins and nutritional supplements and selling
Charles Atlas workout clothing. It plans to market a series of
exercise videos and to make its lessons available for downloading
from the Internet.

   In a 1982 interview at his 23rd Street office, Roman said:
``We're doing as great as we ever did. I carry on exactly as if
Charles was in the next office. The system is still the Atlas
system, so he is in fact still giving the training just as he
always did.''
</P>
<P>
   In those days, roughly 500 English- and Spanish-language
publications carried the Charles Atlas ads, and readers responded
by mailing in a torrent of coupons requesting an initial, free
32-page booklet ``showing how Dynamic Tension can make me a new
man.'' And every month Roman's office sent out Atlas lessons to
customers who had subscribed to the program of exercises and
nutrition tips.
</P>
<P>
   Originally advertised only in comics and other magazines, the
ads Roman created years ago are still a presence on the Internet
and even in Modern Maturity, said Hogue, the company's current
owner and president.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, the average Charles Atlas program student was
aged 15 to 25, but because we've been in the business for about 70
years, many of our students now are in their 50s, 60s, even 70s,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some women were among the early subscribers, but Roman said,
``We don't cater to them; we never have.''
</P>
<P>
   Dynamic Tension is the name Roman gave to a system of exercises
that Atlas said was inspired by a lion at the Prospect Park Zoo.
Atlas observed the lion's stretching and concluded that the beast
was pitting one muscle against another, thereby strengthening them
both.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Roman participated as a consultant in preparing a new
Charles Atlas ad campaign, which is planned for next year. The
campaign uses his 97-pound weakling ad among others.
</P>
<P>
   Roman was born and raised in Manhattan, graduated from the
Ethical Culture School and received a bachelor's degree in 1928
from New York University.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, he was a Navy officer.
</P>
<P>
   He married Dorothy Raphael in 1933; she died in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Roman is survived by his wife, the former Orpha Vazquez, whom he
married in 1998; two sons, Roger and Ronald, both of South Florida;
a sister, Leonore Roman Malino of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Middle-sized and trim, Roman used Charles Atlas' fitness
techniques until his life's end. In the 1982 interview, he said,
``I keep pretty fit, keep from getting a potbelly.''

BODY OF MISSING TEACHER FOUND IN WOODS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DANIEL VASQUEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEMBROKE, Mass. _ The emotional eight-day search for a
27-year-old Boston school teacher who disappeared July 11 after her
car broke down near the Cape Cod canal ended Monday when the body
of Melissa Gosule was found in a heavily wooded area near the
Chafin Reservoir.
</P>
<P>
   The area is just off a dirt road near Plymouth Street, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gosule, an outgoing substitute teacher who lived in Jamaica
Plain, returned from a bike ride on a path near the Sagamore rotary
to find her car wouldn't start. That's when, police say, she took a
ride from a stranger, Michael Gentile, 31, of Falmouth. She was
reported missing by her family at midnight July 12.
</P>
<P>
   Gentile, a high school dropout and ex-con, is now jailed on $1
million bail for allegedly kidnapping Gosule. Plymouth County
District Attorney Michael Sullivan said Monday night that
investigators would continue Tuesday to process the site where
Gosule was found and have not yet charged Gentile with murder.
</P>
<P>
   In the hours after she climbed into Gentile's truck July 11,
Gosule made several calls to her mother over Gentile's cellular
phone, arranging a meeting in Brockton.
</P>
<P>
   But she never showed up at her home.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of Gosule's body brought to a tragic conclusion a
long search for her by police as well as family members, friends
and volunteers who had never met the girl or her family but were
moved by the story of her disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   The searchers, who included Gosule's father, Leslie, armed with
a store-bought map, scoured roadsides, dusty paths, cranberry bogs
and dumpsters.
</P>
<P>
   Hope for the young woman dimmed three days after her
disappearance as family friends discovered Gosule's maroon bicycle,
as well as her jeans, bathing suit, knapsack, duffel bag in dense
woods by Monponsett Pond in Halifax about three miles south of
where she was found.
</P>
<P>
   State Police then put Gentile, whom they had traced with
cellular phone records, under intense surveillance. He was arrested
Thursday by eight troopers as he jogged along the Cape Cod Canal.
</P>
<P>
   At his arraignment Friday, Gentile was was ordered held at
Plymouth County Jail under $1 million cash bail, as Gosule's family
hugged and sobbed in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Cell phone records revealed, said prosecutor Paul Dawley, that
the last call Gosule made was around 8:20 p.m. Sunday, when she
spoke to her mother to tell her a man offered her a ride to
Brockton as long as she paid for the gas. Shortly after 9 p.m.,
Gentile used the cell phone to call his boss, telling him his truck
had broken down and he would not report to his 1 a.m. job
delivering The Boston Globe to stores and vending machines.
</P>
<P>
   Dawley revealed during the court hearing that Gentile, after
realizing police considered him a suspect, had allegedly called a
friend to say he shared marijuana and sex with Gosule the day he
met her and offered help.
</P>
<P>
   Gentile continued to say, according to police, that Gosule bled
during the sex and that she became upset and ``freaked out'' after
he told her he was not going to give her a ride to Brockton.
</P>
<P>
   Gentile also allegedly told investigators that he dropped Gosule
off at a Dunkin' Donuts in Kingston.
</P>
<P>
   But police have been unable to verify Gentile's account and
believe he made up the story to explain away any forensic evidence
that might be found on his clothes or Gosule's.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, family members of Gosule have already said Gentile's
story does not ring true.
</P>
<P>
   Gosule's mother, Sandra Glaser, told a television reporter this
weekend that she knows her daughter would ``never, never, never''
have smoked drugs or had consensual sex with a stranger. ``She did
not like to party,'' Glaser said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Gosule and Gentile are a study in contrasts.
</P>
<P>
   She was an honor student with a degree from the University of
Connecticut, whose social conciousness caused her to volunteer
widely for groups helping the abused and the disadvantaged.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Halifax, not far from where Gosule's bike and
other belongs were found, Gentile dropped out of school in the
ninth grade and has a number of burglary and theft convictions. He
was released last year from Barnstable County jail.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days friends of Gosule's family have suggested that
State Police had diverted their attention from finding Gosule to
looking for John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and sister-in-law and his
plane, which disappeared Friday off Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Police, however, said they have continued a thorough and
extensive search ever since Gosule was first reported missing.

LAWMAKERS SAY LOBBYISTS' GIFTS DON'T INFLUENCE THEIR VOTES 
</HEADLINE>

 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. _ The 1999 legislative session was still two
days away when lobbyists began dropping off gifts at the office of
Missouri Rep. O.L. Shelton.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next four months, the St. Louis Democrat accepted
$5,843.50 in free food, drink and tickets to concerts and baseball
games, lobbyist disclosure reports show. Those gifts were part of
nearly $140,000 in favors given to lawmakers by people seeking to
shape, pass or kill laws that govern how Missourians live.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists supplied dinners and drinks. They provided free
continuing education classes to lawyers. They paid to send new
lawmakers to Washington for a pro-business seminar.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists also passed out 51 season passes to St. Louis
Cardinals baseball games. And they provided tickets to see Big 12
basketball and to hear tenor Luciano Pavarotti and pop singer
Alanis Morissette.
</P>
<P>
   Those are just some of the constant stream of gifts that
lobbyists bestowed on lawmakers as part of the annual spending
spree that surrounds the Missouri General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   A computer analysis of lobbyist disclosure reports found that
from Dec. 1, when lawmakers can begin filing bills, through May 31,
lobbyists gave lawmakers an average of 48 gifts worth $1,961 every
day the legislature met.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers are so comfortable accepting handouts that they
actually solicited $4,361 of those gifts, reports show.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri's 1,058 registered lobbyists spent hundreds of
thousands more on legislative committees, caucuses and other groups
of lawmakers. Those gifts are not attributed to individual
legislators. A spot check of leading lobbyists found that the top
15 spent $201,000 more on lawmaker groups.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists' giving is concentrated on St. Louis-area Democrats.
Of the top 14 gift recipients, 12 are from the St. Louis area; the
other two are members of the House leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The top Kansas City-area recipient was Democrat Tom Hoppe, who
ranked 27th overall with $1,589.39 in gifts. More than $700 was in
the form of tickets to children's shows. Hoppe said he passes the
tickets out to people in his district.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of legislators ask lobbyists to donate things,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Talk to the lobbyists doling out the most favors and to the
lawmakers taking them, and you get nearly complete agreement: All
those goodies have no effect on the way lawmakers vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spending makes no difference to me one way or another,''
said Bill Gamble, whose 43 high-powered clients range from Kansas
City government to Union Electric Co. and Station Casinos Inc.
``It's hard work that accomplishes your goals. It's working with
clients and knowing the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Brian May, a St. Louis Democrat running for state treasurer
next year, received $1,260 in lobbyists' gifts. He said the gifts
are usually unrelated to any legislation he is working on and have
no effect on his judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only things I'm concerned with are how (legislation)
affects my district, then my state, and my personal feeling toward
the issue,'' May said. ``In no way does it compel you to vote for
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Then why do lobbyists spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on
the legislature if the money has no effect?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not quite sure,'' May said.
</P>
<P>
   To many others, however, the reason lobbyists are ready with a
handout is all too clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called influence peddling,'' said Rep. Bill Boucher, a
Kansas City Democrat who is one of five lawmakers who took no gifts
during the session. ``Everyone claims it has no effect, but it's
bound to influence your decision. It's hard to admit it, but in my
experience there is a lot of influence won by wining and dining and
offering gifts.''
</P>
<P>
   Boucher, a former design engineer, said lobbyists are similar to
sales staffs who would treat designers to expensive outings while
trying to persuade them to use their products.
</P>
<P>
   ``They expect something in return _ a vote or at least strong
consideration for a vote in their favor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Greening, an associate professor of management at the
University of Missouri, said business weighs the cost of lobbying
against the potential benefits. And business owners expect results.
</P>
<P>
   ``A law passing _ or not passing _ can mean millions in lost
revenue,'' Greening said. ``So spending $20,000 to $30,000 to save
millions is a trade-off that anyone would make.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the system leads to good public policy is a matter of
perspective, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe what's good for General Motors is not good for
America,'' Greening said. ``But you can argue it both ways.''

   ... can argue it both ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Missouri is one of 19 states that sets no restrictions on gifts
lawmakers can accept. The Senate has a sometimes-flouted rule that
limits individual gifts to $50 and gifts from a single lobbyist to
$100 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas sets a $40 limit on gifts to individual lawmakers. But
the limit does not apply to hospitality _ which includes food,
drinks and even tickets to ball games and other recreational
activities _ if the lobbyist goes along.
</P>
<P>
   Roth Judd, executive director of the Wisconsin Ethics Board,
said his state banned gifts to lawmakers in 1957. The rules have
been good to both lawmakers and lobbyists, he said. But the primary
benefit, Judd said, is the fostering of public confidence in
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It increases the likelihood that public policy is made based
on its merits as opposed to something else,'' Judd said. ``A
lobbyist testifying to a committee can have a reasonable degree of
assurance that the chairman didn't just come back from dinner with
lobbyists for the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri, the care and feeding of lawmakers has become a
standard, even expected, lobbying technique. What began as a bit of
clubby salesmanship has evolved into a legislature on the dole.
</P>
<P>
   Most lawmakers, lobbyists and critics of the process agree that
even the most free-spending lobbyist isn't directly buying votes.
It's a more subtle process of building a relationship and currying
favor by providing perks.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists, for example, supply lawmakers with food and soft
drinks for school groups visiting from their home districts. They
provide food and beer for receptions in their offices. The state
Chamber of Commerce paid $695 to track bills and their amendments
for House Republican leader Delbert Scott.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Cigler, a University of Kansas political science
professor, said the spending cultivates a culture of insiders who
do things for each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll never demonstrate the exact linkage between these gifts
and a vote,'' Cigler said. ``But they do have an effect. People who
do nice things for you make you want to do nice things for them.
It's the difference between the influence of a friend and the
influence of a stranger.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ken Jacob, a Columbia Democrat, said lobbyists' gifts buy a
hospitable environment for their message. Over time, most gifts
tend to come from groups that support the lawmaker's positions, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob, who received $1,584 in freebies, the second-most in the
Senate, said legislators need to learn quickly how to say no to
lobbyists bearing gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Lyndon Johnson who said, `If you can't drink their
liquor, take their money and still vote against them, you have no
business being up there,' '' Jacob said.
</P>
<P>
   The pernicious aspect of the process, Jacob said, is that
lobbyist-inspired issues tend to crowd out other issues on the
agenda. And some of the most effective lobbying groups make their
mark without lavishing lawmakers with gifts, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Former Rep. Lloyd Daniel, a Kansas City Democrat who stepped
down in May to take a job with the state, agreed that free meals
and entertainment don't drive legislation as much as it seems.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation, he said, moves when the interests of business, the
governor, lobbyists and lawmakers converge. Lobbyists' spending
simply feeds the system, which conspires against the average voter
who is not part of the Jefferson City clique, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Daniel, who accepted only $40 in gifts, said he did not want
lobbyists feeling he owed them something.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they give you something, it's unspoken that down the line
you can help them out,'' Daniel said.
</P>
<P>
   Some lobbyists acknowledge that the freebies help them keep up
with others trying to influence lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Barrie, who lobbies for the state Bar Association,
said her organization's lavish receptions and other events offer a
warm environment to get to know lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Barrie reported spending $16,595 on lawmakers, plus the
undisclosed value of free legal education seminars her organization
provides to lawyers in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's an access that you get,'' Barrie said. ``Other
groups rely on grassroots access by coming to the capitol in
droves. Part of my job is building rapport with legislators. They
don't vote my way on every issue, but it's helpful to talk to them
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   As a non-partisan organization, the Bar Association does not
make campaign contributions. So the free food and gifts provide an
entree to lawmakers that other groups obtain through direct
donations, Barrie said.
</P>
<P>
   Gamble, who reported spending $59,921 _ more than any other
lobbyist _ expressed a similar sentiment. He said he could
successfully represent his clients if the state banned spending
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want the playing field even,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists and the recipients of their largess insist that the
gifts have no effect on legislation. Shelton, the St. Louis
representative whose average of $1,298 a month in freebies was tops
in the legislature, said he never felt that lobbyists gave him
things because they wanted something in return.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get the same thing you get _ a conversation,'' Shelton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Then why do lobbyists routinely give Shelton hundreds of dollars
worth of gifts?
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of stupid question is that?'' he said. ``I'm not
going to answer that. How would I know?''

ISRAELI LEADER SETS TIME FRAME FOR PEACE PUSH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak suggested Monday
a 15-month time frame for resolving outstanding issues with the
Palestinians as well as reviving talks with the Syrians and
Lebanese in an effort to bring lasting peace to the region.
</P>
<P>
   Such an ambitious framework, the newly elected prime minister
said, would allow all the participants to see if a breakthrough was
possible or if stalemate would prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Barak wrapped up his first official visit here by joining
President Clinton for a White House news conference in which a
series of new security commitments were announced. The two leaders
also said an agreement had been reached for an Israeli astronaut to
fly on a space shuttle mission next year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton praised Barak for his determination to accelerate the
peace process on all fronts and suggested that Syrian President
Hafez Assad had a ``golden opportunity'' to resume peace
negotiations. And, he said, if peace between Israel and Syria can
be attained, the United States would like to normalize its
relations with Syria, which it considers a supporter of terrorist
activities within its borders and in parts of Lebanon that it
controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are committed to the renewal of the peace process,'' Barak
said, pledging to ``move the process forward simultaneously on all
tracks'' as Israel seeks a peace treaty with the Palestinians, the
Syrians and the Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will leave no stone unturned in our effort to reinvigorate
the process,'' Barak said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Clinton discussed what concrete moves to make, but
neither divulged the next step.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes in this process, the less you say, the better,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister said he would suggest a 15-month time frame
``within which we will know whether we have a breakthrough and are
really going to put an end to the conflict or, alternatively _ I
hope this will not be the case _ that we are stuck once again.''
</P>
<P>
   The 15-month time frame would be ``a signal to all publics and
us, the players, that we are not talking about a miraculous
solution, a magic solution, that will drop upon us from heaven in
three weeks. And we are not intending to drag our foot for another
three years,'' Barak said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the framework was not a deadline but a guide for all
participants to avoid suspicions and provide a common
understanding. The time frame also coincides with the end of
Clinton's two-term tenure as president. Clinton has made no secret
of wanting to resolve the Middle East conflict before he leaves
office.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said he intended to implement the Wye River Memorandum,
which his predecessor signed, and then suspended, that called for
Israel to withdraw from an additional 13.1 percent of occupied West
Bank lands.
</P>
<P>
   And he said he would pursue at the same time the so-called final
status negotiations with Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat. Those negotiations were to have been completed in May under
a previous timetable, and they involve the most delicate issues,
such as refugees, a Palestinian state and the status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Barak previously said he was willing to negotiate with Syria on
the status of the Golan Heights, which Israel captured in the 1967
war with its Arab neighbors. Negotiations with Syria have been
suspended for three years.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Clinton praised news reports that Assad had urged
terrorist organizations to put down their weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anything Syria does to disassociate itself from
terrorists is a positive step in the right direction,'' Clinton
said. Barak agreed, calling it a positive move, if true.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he planned no meetings with Assad but would ``make
it known'' to him the ``very satisfactory results of this meeting
and that this is an important time to restart the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   Syria controls the portions of Lebanon that are home to
Hezbollah, the fundamentalist group that stages attacks on Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The objective now is to put the peace process back on all its
tracks. But we should have no illusions. The way ahead will be
difficult. There are hard decisions to be made,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   To strengthen Israel's military hand, Clinton also approved the
sale of 50 U.S.-made F-16 fighter jets, increased military aid by
one-third to $2.4 billion a year, and agreed to finance Israel's
development of an anti-missile system. Both agreed to create a
joint planning group that would consult on security matters and
report regularly to Barak and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would also work to press Congress to expedite
economic aid not only to Israel but to the Palestinians and
Jordanians.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also announced that the United States and Israel ``will
be taking our partnership to new heights _ literally.'' He said an
Israeli astronaut and an Israeli payload of instruments will fly on
a space shuttle mission next year.
</P>
<P>
   NASA announced Monday that two Israeli astronauts training in
Houston are Ilan Ramon, 45, an Israeli air force colonel, and
Itzhak Mayo, 44, an Israeli air force lieutenant colonel. The
launch date and the rest of the crew have not been announced by
NASA. But the two men, one a backup, have been training as mission
specialists at the Johnson Space Center since July 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Neither leader wanted to comment directly about the possible
release of American Jonathan Pollard, who is serving a life
sentence in the United States for spying on Israel's behalf. Last
year, as part of the Wye River agreement, Clinton agreed to ask
federal security agencies to review the idea of Pollard's release
but has not reported back on their findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any public discussion of this issue doesn't push forward the
purpose of having him released,'' Barak said, adding his support
for the convicted spy's freedom. The Pollard issue almost scuttled
the entire Wye River accord last year when Israel Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu wanted to return to Israel with Pollard on his
airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reiterated earlier statements that his wife's position
as a prospective candidate on the status of Jerusalem or a
Palestinian state had no bearing on official U.S. policy and its
neutrality on final-status issues. Hillary Rodham Clinton,
pondering a bid for the Senate from New York, wrote a letter to
Jewish groups proclaiming Jerusalem the eternal capital of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is any inconsistency there at all,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak will meet with members of Congress today and then depart
for Britain, where he will meet with Prime Minister Tony Blair
before returning home.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, obviously more comfortable with Barak than with the
conservative Netanyahu, spent an unusual amount of time with the
prime minister, holding another three-hour session Monday after a
more relaxed get-together Thursday.

INSTEAD OF RICH DONORS, BUSH CAMPAIGN TO PAY FOR BOOTH AT STRAW
POLL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Under pressure from one of his Republican
presidential opponents, Gov. George W. Bush ordered his campaign
Monday to pay for a $43,500 booth at next month's Iowa straw poll
rather than having six wealthy friends pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also surrendered to pressure from the news media and public
interest groups and released the list of 115 elite fund-raisers,
dubbed ``Pioneers'' by his campaign for raising at least $100,000
each for his presidential effort.
</P>
<P>
   The reversals were part of Bush's effort to prevent his record
$37 million campaign account from looking like a sellout to moneyed
special interests instead of a groundswell of populist support. In
both cases, Bush had been accused of trying to circumvent campaign
finance limits.
</P>
<P>
   Bush came under fire Friday from multimillionaire candidate
Steve Forbes for asking six individuals to pay $50,000 to the Iowa
Republican Party for his booth and tables at the Aug. 14 straw
poll, the first key test of a campaign's popular strength.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign had set the price for the 60,000-square-foot
site outside the Hilton Coliseum in Ames by bidding on it. Most
straw poll participants will have to pass by the site on their way
into the coliseum. By comparison, the next highest price paid for a
booth was $8,000 by Forbes. Elizabeth Dole paid $5,500. Both
candidates, as well as other participants, paid for the booths out
of their campaign accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes campaign manager Bill Dal Col said using the donors to
pay for the booth violated federal law limiting contributions to
$1,000 a person.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign and Iowa GOP officials said the practice was
legal because the straw poll is a fund-raiser for the state party.
All Bush had done, they argued, was encourage contributions to the
party.
</P>
<P>
   But spokesman Karen Hughes said Monday that Bush still believed
his actions were proper but had directed the campaign to pay for
his booth and ask the Iowa GOP to refund the checks to the six
donors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush believes having the location near the door will
benefit his campaign as well as the Iowa party,'' Hughes said. ``He
therefore decided to remove any question or doubt by paying for
these expenses directly from his presidential campaign account.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also decided to release the names of his elite group of
``Pioneer'' fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just start with my best friends, all of whom would like to see
me be president and all of whom are anxious to help me become
president,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a grass-roots organization. These are people who
decided to take time out of their lives to help me become the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   But the group Texans for Public Justice said Bush's elite group
of fund-raisers actually was a method for getting around the
federal campaign contribution limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly it skirts the spirit of the law where each individual
contribution is limited to $1,000,'' said Craig McDonald, executive
director of Texans for Public Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Bush noted many of the Pioneers are people like longtime friend
and national campaign chairman Don Evans or his brother Marvin
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, neither Evans nor Marvin Bush were on the list the
Bush campaign released. However, the governor's sister, Doro Koch,
was on the list, as were two uncles: Jonathan Bush and William H.T.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Four of Bush's former partners in the Texas Rangers baseball
team also were on the list: Roland Betts of New York, Bill DeWitt
and Mercer Reynolds of Ohio and Edward ``Rusty'' Rose of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent Houstonians on the list include: Vinson &AMP; Elkins
lawyer Joe B. Allen; Goldman Sachs partner Peter Coneway; former
Reliant Energy Chief Executive Officer Don Jordan; energy
investment banker Rich Kinder and his wife, Nancy; and Enron
Chairman Ken Lay.
</P>
<P>
   Four men who serve on the nine-member University of Texas board
of regents with Evans made the list: Raul Romero of Houston, Tom
Loeffler of San Antonio, A.R. ``Dub'' Riter of Tyler and Tony
Sanchez of Laredo.
</P>
<P>
   More than 350 people have signed up to try to become Pioneers
for the Bush campaign by raising at least $100,000. The list Bush
released was of the 115 who have made it so far.

KANSAS LOBBYISTS GIVE OUT THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO LAWMAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 JOHN A. DVORAK  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOPEKA, Kan. _ When the Kansas Legislature began considering a
bill to change the qualifications of the state bank commissioner,
the Kansas Bankers Association paid plenty of attention.
</P>
<P>
   They paid plenty of money, too.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the association shelled out $20,000 lobbying
the Legislature this year, more than any single group or company,
according to reports filed with the Governmental Ethics Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping for someone to grab the lunch tab at a restaurant near
the Statehouse? Up for an evening reception at the Topeka Country
Club? A lobbyist from the Kansas Bankers Association would have
taken care of you _ if, that is, you were a member of the House or
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   However, in Topeka the lawmakers need not wait for a bank
lobbyist to provide freebies.
</P>
<P>
   The 576 registered lobbyists spent $444,000 for the 1999 session
of the Legislature, the reports show. That's an average of $2,700
for each lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Under Kansas law, lobbyists have to report their total spending.
Much of it is spent on meals and beverages. Some of the money is
spent on gifts, recreational activities and mailings designed to
get information to members of the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Missouri, Kansas lobbyists are not required to list
individuals who receive the perks.
</P>
<P>
   The list of big spenders in Kansas includes lobbyists for
Western Resources, Southwestern Bell, Boeing and the Kansas
National Education Association.
</P>
<P>
   Public agencies, like school districts, also spent money to get
their viewpoint across in the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The money helps companies and groups build personal
relationships with lawmakers, relationships that can be important
as bills are debated.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to pass new laws to restrict all the largess have
failed in the past. With so little support for limiting free
treats, advocates didn't bother trying this year.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists claim they do not attempt to buy influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect nothing in return,'' said Jim Maag, head of the
Kansas Bankers Association. ``Anything we do is well within the
boundaries of propriety.''
</P>
<P>
   The bank lobbyists, he said, want only a fair opportunity to
present facts and confer with members of the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Debate over the bank bill was subtle but important: Should the
commissioner be someone with Kansas ties, someone known to Kansas
bankers? Or should the state open the position up to anyone,
perhaps someone from out of state with regulatory experience,
someone who might be more independent-minded?
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists for bankers favored the localized approach. In the
end, that's how the bill came out.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ray Cox of Bonner Springs, chairman of the House Financial
Institutions Committee, which considered the bill, said he dined
with the bankers a time or two. It didn't influence his vote, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody buys a darn vote around here,'' he said. ``I don't have
to have anybody buy me a darn thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Some citizen activists consider it unseemly that the Legislature
receives so many thousands of dollars of free meals and other
niceties.
</P>
<P>
   Each week the Legislature met this session, lobbyists spent
about $26,000 on average. The figures cover January through April,
which leaves out the final few days of the 1999 session.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern has gone on for years.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyist spending during the 1999 session of the Legislature was
more than in 1998 and 1997, but less than 1996. During the 1990
session, $600,000 was spent.

<P>
   ... $600,000 was spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's so outrageous,'' said Joyce Luschen of Overland
Park, who testified in the past for tougher restrictions on
freebies.
</P>
<P>
   By entertaining members of the House and Senate, lobbyists
receive special access to the lawmaking process, she said. The
lawmakers, she said, don't want to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have this cozy little thing going,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   An activist with United We Stand America of Kansas, Luschen said
no serious attempts were made this year to enact new restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like batting your head against a brick wall,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Topeka, House and Senate members, if they tried, could eat a
free lunch, dinner and probably breakfast as well.
</P>
<P>
   So many dining opportunities exist in Topeka that a ``Social
Calendar'' is distributed through an office in the Statehouse. Some
invitations go to all lawmakers. Others go to selected committees
or groups of lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   A frequent technique is a large dinner reception in the evening,
when the Legislature doesn't normally meet. The city of Overland
Park threw one such meal this year, mostly for Johnson County
lawmakers, costing taxpayers more than $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   Also this year, Sprint, vitally interested in telecommunications
bills, took lawmakers to the Rolling Stones concert in Kansas City,
Mo.
</P>
<P>
   McGill, Gaches &AMP; Associates, a lobbying firm with a long list of
clients, hosts a late-afternoon social get-together in its offices
near the Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   In the past interest groups regularly operated hospitality rooms
in downtown Topeka hotels, places that lawmakers could go for
refreshment. Legislative leaders ultimately asked that the rooms
shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago Rep. Bob Tomlinson of Roeland Park proposed an
amendment to halt wining and dining, unless all lawmakers were
invited to the event.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers do not trade meals for votes, he said. But the wide
availability of freebies doesn't look good to the public, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing seriously wrong in terms of corruption. What I
think is wrong is image,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tomlinson's amendment, which he tried to add to a huge ethics
bill, failed. Later, the entire bill died.
</P>
<P>
   This year, seeing no hope of restricting free meals, he didn't
try. Leaders of the House and Senate made no serious effort to
enact sweeping new rules for lobbyists. Nor did Gov. Bill Graves,
although the governor in the past has indicated a willingness to
sign such bills into law.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the governor issued a written order forbidding top
state administrators and his advisers from going out to dine with
lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us who make public service our careers owe something
to the Kansas taxpayers who pay our salaries _ an honest,
above-board method of doing business,'' Graves said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Legislature weren't covered by the order.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists say the lawmakers are so busy that sharing information
over dinner is essential.
</P>
<P>
   This year, one of the biggest spending lobbyists from Johnson
County, former Senate President Bud Burke, ran up costs of $3,288
while working a bill to aid the proposed Wonderful World of Oz
theme park.
</P>
<P>
   The bill encountered heavy flack. Burke threw a reception for
selected lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting the attention of legislators during the session is
very, very difficult. They just don't have time,'' he said.
``Getting the opportunity to have their undivided attention for a
30-minute presentation, that's what we wanted to accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   Does the lobbying money pay returns? ``It's like advertising,''
Burke concluded. ``I don't think you ever know.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed as Burke wanted.
</P>
<P>
   It's not imperative, however, that lobbyists spend big money.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association wields considerable influence in
the Legislature, particularly in the House. This year, its lobbyist
reported spending only $500.32.
</P>
<P>
   If the Legislature seriously considered a ban on freebies for
lawmakers, lobbyists might not be too upset.
</P>
<P>
   Maag, head of the Kansas Bankers Association, said no matter
what the rules, lobbyists want to be treated equally.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about prohibiting wining and dining, Maag replied: ``I
don't think we would oppose it.''

KENNEDY FLIGHT MAY HAVE ENDED IN OUT-OF-CONTROL PLUNGE

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOURNE, Mass. _ The last flight of John F. Kennedy Jr. ended in
a plunge at 10 times the normal rate for a descent, radar data
released Monday showed, offering a possible explanation for
searchers' failure to recover remains or significant pieces of
wreckage from the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation experts said that rate of descent before the crash on
Friday night made it very likely that the plane was out of control,
though it was uncertain whether it was because of equipment failure
or pilot disorientation or other problems.
</P>
<P>
   With the nation waiting and a thunderstorm threatening,
Massachusetts State Police divers began searching through choppy,
murky waters off Martha's Vineyard for the first time since the
crash but came up with nothing, according to the authorities. One
object that sonar maps showed could be a big hunk of airplane
turned out to be a 14-foot boulder.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement late Monday, Kennedy's uncle, Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass., acknowledged what the Coast Guard had said on
Sunday night _ that the crash had apparently killed Kennedy, who
was 38, and his two passengers: his wife of nearly three years,
Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33, and his sister-in-law, Lauren
Bessette, 34.
</P>
<P>
   ``John was a shining light in all our lives, and in the lives of
the nation and the world that first came to know him when he was a
little boy,'' Kennedy said. ``We pray that John, Carolyn and Lauren
will find eternal rest, and that God's perpetual light will shine
on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kennedy had become personally involved in the search as
early as 7 a.m. Saturday, when he called Gov. John Rowland of
Connecticut to ask for help searching the Long Island Sound area.
Rowland immediately dispatched National Guard helicopters to help
with the search, which gripped the nation as it played out on live
television all weekend.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Monday evening at Otis Air National Guard
Base here, investigators said that as Kennedy headed east toward
Martha's Vineyard, where he was planning to land before hopping
over to Hyannis for a family wedding, his single-engine, six-seat
Piper Saratoga II HP fell 1,100 feet in the final 14 seconds
recorded on radar, ending at 9:40 p.m., one hour after he left
Fairfield, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pearce of the National Transportation Safety Board, who
is leading the investigation, refused to characterize the drop
beyond pointing out that it was about 4,700 feet per minute, or
about 50 miles an hour. Aviation authorities said a typical descent
for a landing would be 400 to 500 feet per minute, or less than 10
miles an hour. The plane was lost from the radar screens at 1,100
feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would indicate the airplane is out of control,'' said
Rudy Kapustin, who worked as an accident investigator at the NTSB
for 24 years, ending in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Kapustin said the pilot might have begun a normal turn but lost
sight of the horizon, then made the turn too tight, banking the
plane too far over and losing lift. ``That rate of descent is
extremely high, and there is no good reason, no operational reason,
why he would intentionally enter into that kind of rate of
descent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port, the tall American flag
continued to fly at full mast as evening fell, and family members
remained silent despite the tent city of reporters camped in front.
Only one major movement could be observed: the exodus of trucks
carrying equipment _ a generator, planks for a dance floor, tent
poles _ that had been rented for the wedding of Rory Kennedy, a
cousin of Juhn F. Kennedy Jr. The wedding had been scheduled for
Saturday and now has been postponed.
</P>
<P>
   Ethel Kennedy and her son Max could be seen out on the water for
a short sail. The family received communion in the morning from a
priest in white vestments. But otherwise, little movement was
visible behind the white picket fence of Marchant Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans remained stunned by the demise of the man they
had watched grow from ``John-John'' to ``the Hunk'' to the
publisher of a glitzy political magazine, George. As an indication
of the interest in the case, CNN and MSNBC broke away from a news
conference by President Clinton to cover a statement by the family
of Carolyn Kennedy Bessette, issued at their home in Greenwich,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference on Cape Cod, the authorities said no one
has reported seeing the plane crash. In a potential break for
investigators, Pearce said preliminary information from the plane's
previous owner is ``that there is a device that records possibly
the last transmission through the radio, which would be to
air-traffic control, over the transmitter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not know how this particular device works as yet, and we
are trying to determine if it was operational,'' Pearce added.
</P>
<P>
   A salvage ship and a submersible camera, both from the Navy,
arrived Monday to help with the search over 24 square miles off Gay
Head, the western tip of Martha's Vineyard. But the going has been
slow, and divers returned to shore before dark, as rain rolled in.
Pearce said searchers had recovered ``numerous small pieces of the
airplane, primarily interior cabin molding, some of the rugs, some
of the cushions, a rudder pedal,'' plus ``the right main landing
gear, which included the wheel and the brake assembly but not the
strut that would extend up above it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been no other exterior sheet metal of the airplane
recovered,'' he added. The largest piece found so far, he said, was
a rug that is about two feet square.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The state police divers from the Underwater Recovery Unit worked
from sonar maps that have been color-coded to show objects with
90-degree angles, indicating possible manmade objects.
</P>
<P>
   The divers, who are working in seas that are about 80 feet deep,
have nine more promising spots, which they call ``targets of
opportunity,'' that investigators have identified on sonar maps.
Debris is being taken to a hangar here, where NTSB investigators
are poring over refueling and maintenance records for Kennedy's
plane. Investigators said they also are interviewing people who saw
the plane depart New Jersey, and pilots and flight instructors who
flew with Kennedy and might be able to provide background
information.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy had suffered a sports injury shortly before his death.
The Toronto Star reported Monday that Keith Stein, vice president
for corporate affairs of Magna International Inc., an auto parts
company in Aurora, Ontario, said that when Kennedy flew in on July
12 to discuss investment in George magazine, he brought along a
flight instructor.
</P>
<P>
   ``John indicated he wasn't comfortable flying by himself with a
broken foot,'' The Star quoted Stein as saying. ``He mentioned
something about needing help with the pedals.''
</P>
<P>
   Rear Adm. Richard Larrabee of the Coast Guard, who had
maintained publicly that searchers were looking for survivors long
past the time experts expected they could have lived in the chilly
ocean, showed a similar optimism Monday about the search, pointing
to the sophisticated equipment that had arrived Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A Coast Guard spokesman, Cmdr. Mike Lapinski, said he had
received several news media inquiries about the size of the search.
He said it was on the same scale as many others the Coast Guard
performs each year that receive little public notice, and added
that it was ``necessary and appropriate given the uncertainty and
the size of the search area.''
</P>
<P>
   In its statement, the Bessette family said: ``John and Carolyn
were true soulmates, and we hope to honor them in death in the
simple manner in which they chose to live their lives. We take
solace in the thought that together they comfort Lauren for
eternity.''
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference, President Clinton said he believed the
search should continue. ``John Kennedy and his sister and later his
wife were uncommonly kind to my daughter and my wife,'' he said.
``This has been a very difficult thing for us personally, as well
as because of my position. They are very strong people, and I think
they're carrying on as well as any human beings could, but they
need the support and prayers of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Ehud Barak, the new Israeli prime minister, appearing with
Clinton, called the deaths a ``tragedy that I believe touched
hearts of billions all around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy did not obtain his pilot's license until April 1998. He
said he had been fascinated by flight since childhood. In an
interview in 1995, replayed Monday on the ABC talk show ``The
View,'' Barbara Walters asked if he once had wanted to be an
astronaut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I did _ helicopter pilot, astronaut, something in the
air,'' he said. ``Growing up, there were always helicopters landing
on the front lawn of the White House, and usually one parent or
another would emerge from them, so I kind of got this thing about
helicopters.'' Asked when that changed, he laughed and said, ``I'm
not sure it's changed.''

   Stanley Tretick, the Look magazine photographer known for his
intimate pictures of the Kennedy White House, including one of John
F. Kennedy Jr. as a toddler playing under his father's desk, died
Monday at a nursing home in Gaithersburg, Md. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was pneumonia, said the author Kitty Kelley, a close
friend. Ms. Kelley added that Tretick had been incapacitated for
the last four years after several strokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him what happened over the weekend, but I'm not sure he
was aware of it,'' Ms. Kelley said of the presumed death of
Kennedy. ``I told him his photographs were all over television.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kelley recalled how Tretick had wanted to put together a
series of photographs of President Kennedy and his son, but
Jacqueline Kennedy was against the idea at first, not wanting her
husband to use the pictures for political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in October 1963, when the first lady left the White House
on a trip, Tretick was allowed to take candid pictures of father
and son, including the desk picture, which Ms. Kelley said he knew
he would be remembered for.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, Ms. Kelley said, she asked the young Kennedy to
sign the original photograph, and he did.
</P>
<P>
   Tretick also took many photographs of the Kennedy administration
at work, including a well-known lineup of the president with his
military advisers during the Cuban missile crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Stanley Tretick was born on July 21, 1921, in Baltimore,
and grew up in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He worked for the Acme News Service and then United Press
International, covering the Korean War, the White House, Capitol
Hill and presidential campaigns and elections from 1952 to 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Tretick won numerous awards for his work in the White House
Photographers' competition. He was referred to as ``President
Kennedy's photographic Boswell'' in the final publication of Look.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Tretick became close to Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and
covered his presidential campaign in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   He rebuffed an approach by President Jimmy Carter to become
Carter's personal photographer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel he wanted an intimate, personal photographer
around him,'' Tretick said in an interview with The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   After Look folded, Tretick worked as a freelance photographer
and for People magazine until he retired after a stroke in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Tretick is survived by a brother, Gordon Tretick of New Milford,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Before Kennedy's election, Tretick was best known for an article
he wrote for The Saturday Evening Post in 1958 called ``I Shoot the
Big Shots.''
</P>
<P>
   In the article, he discussed his coverage of the Senate rackets
committee hearings, in which he had so angered a gangster named
Johnny Dio that Tretick had to duck when Dio swung at him. He got
the picture, but complained, ``The worst part of being hit while on
an assignment is that some other photographer invariably scoops you
with a sensational shot of you getting belted.''  &QL;

SQUABBLES AGAIN STALL COLOMBIAN TALKS WITH REBELS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN OTIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ Workers in the village of Uribe laid wooden
slabs across beer crates to build a stage for what were supposed to
be historic peace talks. School teachers provided desks to seat
delegates. Restaurants stocked up on food and drink for the
expected media hordes.
</P>
<P>
   But the town's last-minute preparations to host long-awaited
negotiations between the Colombian government and Marxist rebels
was all for naught. The talks, which were scheduled to begin
Monday, were postponed again over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least the beer can be saved, because that doesn't spoil,''
one disgruntled store owner told the Bogota daily El Tiempo.
</P>
<P>
   Uribe residents aren't the only ones feeling snubbed. Many
Colombians are rapidly losing faith in the 7-month-old peace
process. Analysts said they are questioning whether the government
should negotiate with the rebels after they launched a recent
offensive, committed human rights abuses, made money from dope
deals and constantly postponed negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is very grave,'' said Alfredo Rangel, a former
government security adviser. ``For the first time, the peace
process is in serious danger of freezing indefinitely or of being
suspended. I think the government is starting to pay for the
carelessness with which it has managed the process up to now.``
</P>
<P>
   In Washington Monday, the State Department's spokesman said the
breakdown in the Uribe peace talks rests squarely on the shoulders
of the country's largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, or FARC.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FARC's cynical manipulation of the peace process must end
immediately,'' spokesman James Rubin said. ``The FARC continues to
launch bloody, unprovoked attacks that result in numerous
casualties, not only of Colombian security forces, but also of many
innocent men, women and children.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangel and others doubt that the rebels want an immediate truce.
They also blame President Andres Pastrana for improvising rather
than mapping out a long-term peace strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Talks to end Colombia's 35-year civil war began Jan. 7 with a
ceremony attended by Pastrana and FARC leaders. But the FARC
refused to call a cease fire, and negotiations broke down within
weeks of the ceremony. The two sides were finally scheduled to
reunite on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   However, Monday's talks were canceled when FARC and government
representatives clashed over the formation of an international
verification commission. The commission would monitor the FARC's
behavior in a jungle zone the size of Switzerland that has been
demilitarized by the Colombian government as a good-faith gesture.
</P>
<P>
   The FARC launched its latest offensive earlier this month from
the DMZ, and government officials and human-rights workers both
accused the guerrillas of conscripting local residents into the war
and of stashing hostages in the zone.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, FARC spokesman Raul Reyes admitted that, within the
DMZ, the guerrillas have executed people suspected of being
government spies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If any governmental or quasi-governmental organization enters
in order to attack the people or the FARC, we will move against
them,'' Reyes said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the DMZ has become a huge embarrassment for
Pastrana. They compared it to the public outrage provoked by
reports of a luxurious, made-to-order ``prison'' country club for
the late drug lord Pablo Escobar in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The FARC's actions ``have not helped those who back the peace
process. On the contrary, they have strengthened the most hard-line
elements of the armed forces ... and those who favor total war,''
wrote Juan Lozano, a columnist for the independent newspaper El
Tiempo.
</P>
<P>
   Such sentiments may be partly due to the army's successful
counterattack during the guerrillas' most recent offensive. More
than 300 combatants, mostly guerrillas, were killed in the fighting
in what is described as the first army triumph in several years.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana admitted last week that as his 11-month-old government
pursues negotiations, the army is bracing for a wider conflict.
</P>
<P>
   That effort has been boosted by U.S. intelligence agents who now
share information about the rebels with their Colombian
counterparts. U.S. Southern Command chief Gen. Charles Wilhelm said
that such communication was a key factor in the Colombian army's
success at pinpointing and gunning down FARC fighters during the
recent combat.
</P>
<P>
   Much more aid could be on the way. On Friday, Defense Minister
Luis Fernando Ramirez asked U.S. officials in Washington for more
than $500 million in aid to the Colombian army and police.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Colombia will receive about $289 million in U.S.
military aid while up to 300 U.S. military advisers are constantly
being rotated through the country.
</P>
<P>
   Some Colombians believe that an American invasion is the best
solution. In a poll conducted Monday by Bogota's RCN Radio, 66
percent of the nearly 2,000 respondents said that they favored
direct U.S. military intervention in Colombia to stop the
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some observers believe that the recent developments could
turn out to be a boon for negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The FARC's military setbacks may indicate that the guerrillas
have reached their maximum military potential and should sit down
for talks while they are at their strongest.
</P>
<P>
   Rodrigo Losada, a political science professor at Javeriana
University in Bogota, said that enthusiasm in Washington for
sharply increasing military aid to Colombia could also have an
impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guerrillas began the peace talks because they perceived
that the United States was not going to tolerate, indefinitely,
their marriage of convenience with drug traffickers,'' Losada said.
``They either start talking now or they will have to expect
increased military action from the United States.''

EXCERPTS FROM CLINTON-BARAK NEWS CONFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from a transcript of a news conference
Monday in the Old Executive Office Building by President Clinton
and Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel, as recorded by The New
York Times.
</P>
<P>
   PRESIDENT CLINTON: Prime Minister Barak and I have had a very
good series of meetings over the past few days. Of course we have
focused primarily on the Middle East peace process. We strongly
agree that a negotiated peace is the best way to make Israel more
secure, the best path to lasting stability and prosperity for all
the peoples of the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   The Prime Minister is determined to accelerate that process, to
reach, with Chairman Arafat, a permanent-status agreement between
Israel and the Palestinian people and to achieve a broader regional
peace that includes Syria and Lebanon. As he has said, the
objective now is to put the peace process back on all its tracks.
...
</P>
<P>
   As Israel takes calculated risks for peace, we will continue to
support Israel's defense. Today we have agreed to strengthen our
security assistance to Israel, so Israel can best meet the threats
to its citizens, including terrorism and the growing threat of
long-range missiles and weapons of mass destruction. We have also
agreed to establish a high-level joint planning group to consult on
security issues and to report back regularly to the Prime Minister
and to me personally. I intend to work closely with our Congress
for expedited approval of a package that includes not only aid to
Israel but also assistance to the Palestinian people and Jordan in
the context of implementing the Wye River Agreement. ... To enhance
our scientific cooperation, we will create a working group between
NASA and the Israel Space Agency to advance scientific research,
educational activities and the peaceful uses of space. And an
Israeli astronaut and a payload of Israeli instruments will fly on
a space shuttle mission next year. ...
</P>
<P>
   PRIME MINISTER BARAK: President Clinton and I have just
concluded the last in our series of meetings. Those meetings were
held in an atmosphere of deep friendship and understanding that
characterizes the bilateral relationship between Israel and the
United States. Our policy is based on the following:
</P>
<P>
   We are committed to the renewal of the peace process. It is our
intention to move the process forward simultaneously on all tracks:
bilateral, the Palestinian, the Syrians and the Lebanese, as well
as the multilateral.
</P>
<P>
   We will leave no stone unturned in our efforts to reinvigorate
the process, which must be based upon direct talks between the
parties themselves and conducted in an atmosphere of mutual trust.
Any unilateral steps, acts or threats of terrorism, violence or
other forms of aggression have no place in the process of peace.
</P>
<P>
   The peace we seek to establish is only the one that will enhance
the security of Israel. Only a strong and secure Israel is capable
of making the difficult choices that the process requires. I will
not shy away from those difficult choices but I have responsibility
to the people of Israel to do all that I possibly can to minimize
the risks and dangers involved. ...
</P>
<P>
   Q. Mr. President, the Prime Minister has committed himself to
implementing the West Bank back agreed on at Wye River. You just
talked about accelerating the peace process. Realistically
speaking, looking ahead, how long before the final-status talks get
under way on the tough issues like Jerusalem, the Palestinian hopes
for a homeland, refugees and what specific steps can the United
States do to facilitate this process?
</P>
<P>
   ... We should support the security of Israel, the stability of
the region, the economic development of the region, and we should
help to work out any of the particular problems as they arise. In
terms of the timing, I don't think it's for the United States to
set the timetables here....
</P>
<P>
   BARAK: ... I would suggest a kind of framework of about 15
months within which we will know whether we have a breakthrough and
are really going to put an end to the conflict, or, alternatively,
I hope this will not be the case, we are stuck once again.
</P>
<P>
   I use the kind of framework of 15 months to signal to all
publics and us, the players, that we are not talking about a magic
solution that will drop upon us from heaven in three weeks. And we
do not intend to drag our foot for another three years. ...
</P>
<P>
   Q. A question to Prime Minister Barak. What is your reaction to
the meeting of (Syrian Vice President) Abdel-Halim Khaddam in
Damascus with the few Palestinian organizations that are opposing
the peace process? Do you think that it's a significant step for
peace?
</P>
<P>
   BARAK: I can just add to this that I'm fully confident that when
we will have something to tell, we will be interviewed by you and
will tell you ... On the other part of your question, I did not get
a real report about this meeting but if there was such a meeting
and the Syrians really asked the terror organizations to reduce the
level of activity, it is, of course, good news for all of us. ...
</P>
<P>
   Q. You've said that when Mrs. Clinton expresses her opinions
publicly she's just doing something in public which you've done in
private before, that is have disagreements. That's the American
way. But when she talks about an opinion in which she takes the
Israeli position on Jerusalem, doesn't this make it more difficult
for you to be that honest broker?
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON: No, no. For one thing, let me say, that issue is not
one. That's not the public-private distinction. The Government of
the United States, the Executive Branch, the President, is a
sponsor of the peace process and a facilitator of it. In that
context, those of us with positions of official responsibility who
are all the time asking Israel and the Palestinians were all the
time asking both sides not to do anything which prejudices
final-status issues. I have taken the position that my Government
should not prejudice final-status issues. There are many American
citizens who consider, for example, Jerusalem to be the capital of
Israel. ...
</P>
<P>
   Q. Prime Minister Barak was mentioning that 15-month framework
for the negotiations. Do you see, Mr. President, and you, Prime
Minister Barak, a Palestinian state at the end of this period of
time?
</P>
<P>
   BARAK: I think it's too early to think of the results of the
negotiations about permanent status that were hardly begun. And I
don't think that you should interpret this 15-month framework as a
kind of a deadline where everything should be either fully
concluded and implemented or the whole thing is blown apart.

   CITIGROUP PROFIT RISES 21 PERCENT AS NEARLY ALL AREAS GROW
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup, the nation's largest financial services company, said
that its second-quarter profit surged 21 percent, beating Wall
Street expectations, as robust consumer spending and the resilient
stock market bolstered earnings at several leading banks.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every area of activity at the Citigroup conglomerate,
from underwriting insurance policies at Travelers to advising
companies on mergers at Salomon Smith Barney, posted sharply
improved results. Cost reductions, especially in the group's
consumer division, helped the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT POSTS SOLID EARNINGS
</P>
<P>
   With its business surging on several fronts, Microsoft reported
that its quarterly profits increased more than 60 percent,
exceeding Wall Street's expectations. But the world's leading
computer software maker also warned that the growth of its business
is likely to slow during the next year. Shares of the company fell
$1.0625, to $98.375, before the results were released. They fell to
about $97.5625 in after-hours trading.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft agreed to sell its Sidewalk series of Internet city
guides to Ticketmaster Online-Citysearch in a deal worth $240
million.
</P>
<P>
   A SLIGHT DECLINE IN STOCK GAUGES
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices retreated modestly after last week's climb despite
glowing earnings reports. The Dow Jones industrial average was down
22.16 points, to 11,187.68. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index
lost 11.12 points, to 1,407.66, and the NASDAQ composite index fell
34.10 points, to 2,830.38.
</P>
<P>
   IBM PROFIT BEATS EXPECTATIONS
</P>
<P>
   IBM said that its second-quarter profit beat expectations by 3
cents a share, bolstered by sales in its services business and a
surge in computer revenue.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET NOT ONLINE POT OF GOLD
</P>
<P>
   Although many people have founded Internet companies, offered
stock and even created fortunes, not everyone is striking gold. For
every 10 enterprises that receive financing, venture capitalists
say, two will be stock market successes. That means a lot of
entrepreneurs and employees end up disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   TARIFFS IMPOSED ON EUROPEAN FOOD
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to a European Union ban on American beef treated with
growth hormones, the United States imposed tariffs intended to
double the price of $116.8 million in annual imports as familiar as
Dijon mustard from France and as mysterious as the ``guts, bladders
and stomachs of animals (other than fish), whole and pieces
thereof.'' Pork products make up the biggest category subject to
the tariffs. Other foods include Roquefort cheese, truffles,
chocolate and lingonberry and raspberry jams.
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH KOREA AIDS DAEWOO GROUP
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean government intervened to prevent affiliates of
the sprawling Daewoo Group from falling into bankruptcy and setting
off a wave of bankruptcies. At the government's urging, Daewoo's
creditor banks agreed to delay by several months $5.9 billion of
short-term loans that were due this week and lent an additional
$3.4 billion.
</P>

   $21 MILLION HARASSMENT JUDGMENT

FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE LITTLE TO REVEAL TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HYANNIS PORT, Mass. _ The flag in front of the fabled Kennedy
compound continued to wave at full staff Monday almost in defiance
of the ill fortune that has rained on this family.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after they first learned that the plane carrying John
F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and sister-in-law had gone down near
Martha's Vineyard, many of the extended family remained at the
cluster of three homes on the Cape Cod coast.
</P>
<P>
   They have sailed, they have prayed, they have walked on the
beach, but they have given very little indication to the outside
world about how they are coping with the latest tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   However, with the Coast Guard's finding that the plane's
passengers almost definitely did not survive the crash, there were
a few signs that the prominent clan was moving to confront the
outside world.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., left the compound Monday to go to
the Long Island home of Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, the sole
surviving member of former President Kennedy's immediate family.
</P>
<P>
   And for the first time the family issued a statement through the
senator's Washington office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We loved him deeply, and his loss leaves an enormous void in
all our lives,'' the written statement said. ``We are filled with
unspeakable grief and sadness by the loss of John and Carolyn, and
of Lauren Bessette.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since family patriarch Joseph Kennedy first rented a large
white clapboard house in 1925, the Kennedy's compound has served as
playground for rambunctious children and grandchildren and as a
retreat for the adults.
</P>
<P>
   This spacious yet unostentatious spread first appeared on the
national radar when President Kennedy used it as his summer White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hyannis Port will forever be synonymous as a place of
refuge,'' intoned former CBS anchor Walter Cronkite narrating a
film about the compound that is shown in the John F. Kennedy Museum
in nearby Hyannis.
</P>
<P>
   It was here that the family had originally planned to celebrate
the wedding of Robert Kennedy's youngest daughter, Rory, on
Saturday. But the prospect of joy turned to anticipation and then
sorrow as it became clear that some of the guests would not be
showing up.
</P>
<P>
   The large white tents behind the main house that had been
intended for the wedding celebration were turned into a religious
sanctuary for family Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The last service was held Monday morning before the tents were
taken down.
</P>
<P>
   While the family has relied on the compound as a fortress from
the outside world, it was clear that they could not stop the prying
of the media army that has been camped since Saturday on the
surrounding streets and beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Television cameras zoomed in as Ethel Kennedy, her son Max and
Edward Kennedy Jr. climbed into a two-mast sailboat Monday
afternoon and headed out across the water. Standing on the beach
near the dock, a television reporter for ``Access Holiday'' kept
viewers informed of the latest comings and goings of family
members.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not only the media that wanted to get close to the
family during this time of loss.
</P>
<P>
   All day, visitors, many of them clutching cameras, walked down
the beach to a stone jetty, where they could catch a sight of the
main house, originally owned by Rose and Joseph Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   One of those making the pilgrimage was Lauretta Blazicek, who
grew up nearby and often saw the Kennedys at Mass at St. Francis
Xavier Church in Hyannis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is kind of magnetized to this,'' said Blazicek, 52,
who now lives in Enfield, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   One woman who came by said she just felt ``a need to get
close.'' While another described the ``eerie feeling'' of looking
out on now empty lawns that she and many Americans have known
through photographs and television images as the place where the
Kennedy children horsed around, playing football and other sports.
</P>
<P>
   At the Kennedy Museum, a nonstop flow of visitors stared at the
large images of the famous family posing at the compound. One of
the photographs featured John Kennedy Jr. as a young child climbing
on a boat dubbed Double Trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Museum manager Joanne Wiseman said about 600 people had come
through the doors Monday, far higher than the average attendance of
between 200 and 400.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are coming in to pay their respects,'' she said.

   MT. KISCO, N.Y. _ The regular Saturday-morning rush of soccer
moms and joggers filled the Starbucks here recently, but something
was different about a cluster of people hunkered over some tables
in a corner.
</P>
<P>
   They pored over checklists full of strange names: Red-spotted
Purple, American Snout, Hackberry Emperor, Question Mark.
</P>
<P>
   Strung around their necks were $300 binoculars specially
designed not to scan a distant horizon, but to look at things just
8 or 10 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   They spoke of the merits of dogbane and milkweed.
</P>
<P>
   The butterfly count was on again.
</P>
<P>
   Every July, in northern Westchester County and dozens of other
places around North America, hordes of butterfly lovers fan out to
spend a day counting species and individuals of the insect families
that start life as creepy caterpillars, but then, often for just a
week or two, transform into evanescent winged wonders, seeking
nectar and mates before expiring.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, the age-old image of the butterfly collector
equipped with a diaphanous net and a cigar box is being supplanted
by a new, environmentally aware variant with a hands-off ethic _
the butterfly watcher, said Jeffrey Glassberg, the president of the
North American Butterfly Association and the leader of this day's
count.
</P>
<P>
   Butterflies are under assault these days, he said, as their
favorite meadows and wetlands are transformed into sterile cropped
lawns or condo developments. The counts, he said, help track
changes in populations and provide a new way for people to
appreciate the glittery, flitting insects. (The association's Web
site is www.naba.org.)
</P>
<P>
   ``If people don't care about something, they're not going to be
interested in conserving it,'' said Glassberg, who spends most of
his time writing guides to butterfly watching.
</P>
<P>
   The annual butterfly tally began in a few places in 1974,
originally sponsored by the Xerces Society, a group devoted to the
study of all kinds of insects. It has grown explosively in recent
years, with counts in 35 locations in 1984 and 345 sites last year.
</P>
<P>
   After guzzling their grande lattes at the Starbucks, the
counters split into teams and drove away to canvass an area about
15 miles in diameter, visiting spots from cemeteries to meadows,
railroad cuts to swamps.
</P>
<P>
   Glassberg and his wife, Jane Scott, headed to a favorite field
abutting a nature preserve, and soon were wading into tufts of
orange milkweed studded with yellow Eastern tiger swallowtails. The
swallowtails were easy to spot; trickier were the muddy-colored,
thumbnail-size common wood nymphs.
</P>
<P>
   When a wild turkey and a domesticated peacock from a nearby farm
poked their heads out of the meadow grass, the couple barely
noticed _ their eyes fixed on the undergrowth. Every few minutes,
in a kind of rambling poem, a name was called and Glassberg kept a
mental tally.
</P>
<P>
   ``American copper,'' Ms. Scott called out. ``Delaware skipper .
. . Silver-spotted skipper . . . Silver-spotted. Silver-spotted.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the close-focus nature of butterfly watching can put
the watcher in peril. On a recent trip to California, where he was
doing research for a forthcoming guide to Western species,
Glassberg tumbled off a 15-foot cliff while photographing a
California giant skipper, he said. ``But I got the picture, and
it's my only one of that species,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Glassberg recalled a similar day 30 years earlier when
butterflies became his passion. During a break from college in the
'60s, he was hiking across a field on Long Island with a childhood
friend, Robert Robbins, looking for a suitable spot to try out some
mind-altering mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
   But they were enveloped in a cloud of dancing skippers so thick
they resembled confetti, he recalled. ``We put away the mushrooms
and went home and got our nets,'' Glassberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Now his friend, Robbins is the chairman of the department of
entomology at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of
Natural History.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins said that Glassberg's butterfly guides have provided a
new way for amateur naturalists to identify species without
collecting them or dissecting them. Previously, he said, butterfly
books distinguished species using technical, almost microscopic
details. But in Glassberg's years of field observations, Robbins
said, he has found variations in the way butterflies appear that
allow species _ or the sex of individuals of a species _ to be
distinguished simply by looking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The option of just watching butterflies and understanding what
you're seeing just wasn't there before,'' Robbins said.
</P>
<P>
   Glassberg and his wife were behind their usual count, with only
22 species counted by lunchtime. He and his wife paused to eat
sandwiches at the Oakwood Cemetery, but the counting did not stop.
While eating, they counted a gray hairstreak _ the only one they
were to see that day. They continued on their rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Five miles east of Mt. Kisco, at the Pound Ridge Reservation, a
sprawling preserve of meadows and forests, another counting crew
waded into a chest-high thicket of dogbane, a plant dotted with
tiny white blossoms that were milling with bumblebees and
butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Poole, a data processor from Manhattan, saw a flicker
she did not recognize. She called out for help to Rick Cech, a
Manhattan investment banker. ``It's just seething in here,'' she
said. ``What's this right here? Is it a tawny-edged?''
</P>
<P>
   But Cech could not assist. His binoculars were fixed on another
set of beating wings. ``I'm on to my own mystery,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At 6:30 p.m., most of the counters met up to compare notes and
share a meal at the kosher deli in Mt. Kisco. They tallied 6,000
individual butterflies from 50 species _ an encouraging result,
Glassberg said.

 &HT;    Chen's slammed as Braves fall in 10
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ In the spirit of the American League and interleague
play, the Braves displayed some shaky pitching Monday night _ early
and late _ in an 8-7 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays in 10 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Batista hit a leadoff home run off reliever John Hudek to
end it. One inning earlier, John Rocker had worked out of a
first-and-third, none-out situtation that ended with Gerald
Williams making a running, bobbling catch at the wall in left
field.
</P>
<P>
   A flailing Bruce Chen spent the better part of the third inning
under a cloud of home run fireworks in SkyDome. He had given up two
of them, including a Shawn Green grand slam that erased a 4-0 lead,
the second grand slam Chen has allowed in four starts in place of
the injured John Smoltz.
</P>
<P>
   But Chen got a no-decision, thanks to batterymate Javy Lopez,
who ended an 0-for-8 spell with a bases-loaded single in the
seventh inning to give Atlanta a 7-6 lead. Lopez lined a 1-2 pitch
from Paul Quantrill into center field to score the tying and
go-ahead runs.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones started the two-out rally with a double, which was
followed by a Brian Jordan walk and a Keith Lockhart bloop single.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto had ended a 30-inning homerless stretch with
back-to-back home runs by Green and Carlos Delgado in the third
inning to take a 5-4 lead. The inning was reminiscent of Chen's
first major-league start this season, when Gary Gaetti hit a grand
slam for the Cubs on May 21 in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's pitches were back up where they don't belong _ in the
hitters' happy zone _- and he paid the price with six earned runs
in six innings. He has allowed six home runs in four big-league
starts. That's half as many as Odalis Perez, who leads the club
with 12 homers allowed, and he's pitched 70 more innings than
Chen's 22.
</P>
<P>
   Chen has one more chance to make a good impression, when he
pitches in the second game of Friday's doubleheader in
Philadelphia. Then John Smoltz will come back from the disabled
list and Chen will return to AAA Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   After two effective innings, Chen got into a bases-loaded
situation with two out in the third after he'd lost his grip and
walked three batters. Green, an All-Star and the team's leading
home run hitter, patiently waited for his pitch and launched it to
right field for his second career grand slam.

KENNEDY PLANE FELL 1,100 FEET IN SECONDS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOE STINEBAKER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WOODS HOLE, Mass. _ John F. Kennedy Jr.'s powerful single-engine
aircraft plummeted toward the Atlantic Ocean at 4,700 feet per
minute in the seconds before the fatal crash that killed him, his
wife and her sister, federal officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Although officials with the National Transportation Safety Board
were coy about characterizing the descent rate, it was far faster
than first believed and other pilots said that it would have been
virtually impossible for Kennedy to have pulled his Piper Saratoga
II HP out of such a freefall.
</P>
<P>
   ``That airplane would not come down that fast in any normal
configuration,'' said Warren Morningstar, a spokesman for the
Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association. ``The normal rate of
descent you're shooting for as a pilot is 500 to 700 feet per
minute for passenger comfort.''
</P>
<P>
   NTSB officials released more information Monday from additional
radar data received from a Nantucket airport that showed Kennedy's
plane dropped 1,100 feet in only 14 seconds on that hazy Friday
night as the plane flew about four miles southwest of Martha's
Vineyard on its final approach to the island's airport.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pearce, the NTSB's chief investigator in the case, said
the new numbers paint ``a different picture'' for investigators,
but he and others with the NTSB declined to characterize the
plane's rapid descent as being out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Searchers recovered other small pieces of debris from the crash,
but failed to pinpoint the plane's underwater location. Although
investigators believe they have several promising sites within the
24-square-mile ``target area'' off the Martha's Vineyard coast, a
team of 10 divers from the Massachusetts State Police were unable
to find the main portion of the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Police divers will be joined this morning by the USS Grasp, a
Navy salvage and recovery vessel based in Little Creek, Va. The
Grasp, with a crew of 100 _ including 22 Navy divers _ arrived at
the scene Monday afternoon, but dive preparations were not
concluded in time to send divers into the 68-degree waters.
</P>
<P>
   Those divers are expected to search the area this morning,
weather permitting. Capt. Jack Gallant, a public information
officer with the Navy, said the divers would make tethered dives,
meaning they would not be as limited in time and depth as divers
with oxygen tanks might be. Should the wreckage be located, Gallant
said, the Grasp would be able to bring it to the surface, using a
40-foot crane with a 200-foot depth capacity. Ocean depths in the
search area are generally between 60 and 80 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard Rear Adm. Richard Larrabee said that, while Monday
had been primarily ``a day of preparation,'' today's operations
would be ``extensive.'' Several other ships from the Coast Guard
and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will join
in the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators with the NTSB have been interviewing
witnesses at the Essex County Airport in New Jersey, from which the
38-year-old Kennedy, his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33, and
her 34-year-old sister, Lauren Bessette departed Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Based on those interviews and on the few maintenance records
investigators have reviewed, there appears to have been no obvious
mechanical problems with the plane, which Kennedy bought for a
reported $300,000 only three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Pearce said witnesses led investigators to believe most of the
plane's maintenance records were on board at the time of the crash.
However, an annual inspection of the 1996 model plane was conducted
June 28 and showed that the plane had logged only 622 flight hours
since its manufacture. Kennedy last refueled the plane on July 11,
topping off the tank with 62 gallons. Pearce said there were no
indications that the plane had been flown between that refueling
and Friday's fatal crash. Pearce also noted that the plane's
magnetic compass was readjusted two days later.
</P>
<P>
   Because no witnesses have reported seeing or hearing the plane
anywhere along its flight path after its takeoff at 7:38 p.m. EDT,
investigators are unable to determine what type of trouble Kennedy
may have had.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB officials also confirmed Monday that Kennedy's plane was
equipped with a relatively new voice recorder. Pearce said the
recorder appears to have been the type that records the last radio
transmissions made from the plane, although it was unknown if
Kennedy, a novice pilot, was familiar with the equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Lopatkiewicz, a spokesman for the NTSB, said Monday that,
when operating, the system is automatically activated every time
the microphone key is depressed.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, as the reality of the tragedy of the three
deaths finally became obvious Monday, the families of the victims
briefly broke their silence.
</P>
<P>
   After Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., traveled to Bridgehampton,
N.Y., to meet with and console John Kennedy's sister, Caroline
Kennedy Schlossberg, the Kennedy family released a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are filled with unspeakable grief and sadness by the loss
of John and Carolyn and of Lauren Bessette. John was a shining
light in all our lives and in the lives of the nation and the world
that first came to know him when he was a little boy.''
</P>
<P>
   And in Connecticut, another grieving family came to grips with
the loss of two of its members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of these three young people ... was the embodiment of
love, accomplishment and passion for life,'' said a statement from
Carolyn and Lauren Bessette's parents. ``John and Carolyn were true
soul mates, and we hope to honor them in death in the simple manner
in which they chose to live their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement was read in the Bessette family hometown of
Greenwich, Conn., by family friend Grant Stinchfield.
</P>
<P>
   Condolences also poured in from other quarters, with both
President Clinton and GOP presidential hopeful Gov. George W. Bush
addressing the families.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who like Kennedy is the son of a former president, said he
sent letters of condolence to Caroline and Ted Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a family that has endured a lot of incredible
heartbreak,'' Bush said Monday. ``I wish God's blessings on them
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who spent much of the day in meetings and at a news
conference with newly elected Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak,
said the tragedy represented ``a moment of sadness for the United
States,'' and for his own family.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a very difficult thing for us personally,'' the
president said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak offered his country's ``prayers and thoughts to the
Kennedy family.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, outside the TriBeCa apartment where Kennedy and his
wife lived, a memorial of flowers and notes continued to grow as
neighbors and strangers gathered to pay tribute.
</P>
<P>
   ``To John John from a Cuban exile,'' read one note, written in
Spanish and wrapped around a large bundle of red roses.

EDITORIAL: A FASTER TRACK TO MIDEAST PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, July 20:
</P>
<P>
   It has taken Israel's new prime minister, Ehud Barak, less than
two weeks to breathe life and urgency into the stalled quest for
Mideast peace. By setting a 15-month timetable for reaching broad
agreement on a final settlement with the Palestinians and a deal
with Syria covering both the Golan Heights and Lebanon, Barak is
making clear that he believes that the basic issues can be resolved
relatively quickly, if all sides are committed to peace. That will
not be easy. To encourage steady progress, Barak and President
Clinton have agreed to meet regularly at four-month intervals.
</P>
<P>
   Israel is eager to get back to the bargaining table. Since
Barak's election the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, and Syria's
president, Hafez al-Assad, have also made encouraging statements.
On Monday, Syria reportedly told radical Palestinians based in
Damascus to halt violence against Israel. Whether Assad and Arafat
are actually willing to make the necessary compromises for peace
will be discovered soon enough. Syria will probably have to accept
Israeli military monitoring of the Golan border, and Arafat will
have to live with some West Bank Jewish settlements and Israeli
sovereignty over Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Setting a deadline for an agreement in September or October of
next year carries risks. Arafat or Assad could use the approach of
that deadline to press Israel for extra concessions. Missing the
target, even for unavoidable reasons, would be seen as a grave
setback that could fragment Israel's political consensus for peace.
But these risks seem worth taking to energize a process that
depends almost as much on psychology, momentum and good will as it
does on the precise location of new boundary lines drawn on maps.
Getting the details right is vitally important. But achieving a
comprehensive agreement will be possible only if all sides are
prepared to take some risks.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's projected timetable takes appropriate note of the
American political calendar. His target date for agreements falls
within the working life of the Clinton administration, and the plan
for regular meetings will encourage close and consistent American
cooperation. While Barak hopes to avoid the kind of pushing by
Washington that developed during the term of his predecessor,
Benjamin Netanyahu, he wants the United States to be closely
involved in the next round of Mideast peacemaking. Specifically, he
wants America to assist in arranging talks with Syria and help
Israelis and Arabs find practical solutions to issues that may come
up during the bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the last day of his American visit, Barak is scheduled to
meet with Republican congressional leaders. He will urge them to
stop delaying the $500 million assistance package promised by the
administration last year to carry out the Wye River agreements.
Even more important, he will plead with them to halt the
partisanship that has crept into congressional deliberations on
Israel in recent years. Barak and his ambitious agenda for
peacemaking deserve unstinting bipartisan support. &QL;

KENNEDY FLIGHT MAY HAVE ENDED IN OUT-OF-CONTROL PLUNGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to note in 11th graf that flag at Hyannis Port compound has
been lowered to half-staff.)  (mk) 
 By MIKE ALLEN and CAREY GOLDBERG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOURNE, Mass. _ The last flight of John F. Kennedy Jr. ended in
a plunge at 10 times the normal rate for a descent, radar data
released Monday showed, offering a possible explanation for
searchers' failure to recover remains or significant pieces of
wreckage from the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation experts said that rate of descent before the crash on
Friday night made it very likely that the plane was out of control,
though it was uncertain whether it was because of equipment failure
or pilot disorientation or other problems.
</P>
<P>
   With the nation waiting and a thunderstorm threatening,
Massachusetts State Police divers began searching through choppy,
murky waters off Martha's Vineyard for the first time since the
crash but came up with nothing, according to the authorities. One
object that sonar maps showed could be a big hunk of airplane
turned out to be a 14-foot boulder.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement late Monday, Kennedy's uncle, Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass., acknowledged what the Coast Guard had said on
Sunday night _ that the crash had apparently killed Kennedy, who
was 38, and his two passengers: his wife of nearly three years,
Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33, and his sister-in-law, Lauren
Bessette, 34.
</P>
<P>
   ``John was a shining light in all our lives, and in the lives of
the nation and the world that first came to know him when he was a
little boy,'' Kennedy said. ``We pray that John, Carolyn and Lauren
will find eternal rest, and that God's perpetual light will shine
on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kennedy had become personally involved in the search as
early as 7 a.m. Saturday, when he called Gov. John Rowland of
Connecticut to ask for help searching the Long Island Sound area.
Rowland immediately dispatched National Guard helicopters to help
with the search, which gripped the nation as it played out on live
television all weekend.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Monday evening at Otis Air National Guard
Base here, investigators said that as Kennedy headed east toward
Martha's Vineyard, where he was planning to land before hopping
over to Hyannis for a family wedding, his single-engine, six-seat
Piper Saratoga II HP fell 1,100 feet in the final 14 seconds
recorded on radar, ending at 9:40 p.m., one hour after he left
Fairfield, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pearce of the National Transportation Safety Board, who
is leading the investigation, refused to characterize the drop
beyond pointing out that it was about 4,700 feet per minute, or
about 50 mph. Aviation authorities said a typical descent for a
landing would be 400 to 500 feet per minute, or about 5 to 10 mph.
The plane was lost from the radar screens at 1,100 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would indicate the airplane is out of control,'' said
Rudy Kapustin, who worked as an accident investigator at the NTSB
for 24 years, ending in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Kapustin said the pilot might have begun a normal turn but lost
sight of the horizon, then made the turn too tight, banking the
plane too far over and losing lift. ``That rate of descent is
extremely high, and there is no good reason, no operational reason,
why he would intentionally enter into that kind of rate of
descent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port, the tall American flag
had been lowered to half-staff by nightfall, and family members
remained silent despite the tent city of reporters camped in front.
Only one major movement could be observed: the exodus of trucks
carrying equipment _ a generator, planks for a dance floor, tent
poles _ that had been rented for the wedding of Rory Kennedy, a
cousin of Juhn F. Kennedy Jr. The wedding had been scheduled for
Saturday and now has been postponed.
</P>
<P>
   Ethel Kennedy and her son Max could be seen out on the water for
a short sail. The family received communion in the morning from a
priest in white vestments. But otherwise, little movement was
visible behind the white picket fence of Marchant Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans remained stunned by the demise of the man they
had watched grow from ``John-John'' to ``the Hunk'' to the
publisher of a glitzy political magazine, George. As an indication
of the interest in the case, CNN and MSNBC broke away from a news
conference by President Clinton to cover a statement by the family
of Carolyn Kennedy Bessette, issued at their home in Greenwich,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference on Cape Cod, the authorities said no one
has reported seeing the plane crash. In a potential break for
investigators, Pearce said preliminary information from the plane's
previous owner is ``that there is a device that records possibly
the last transmission through the radio, which would be to
air-traffic control, over the transmitter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not know how this particular device works as yet, and we
are trying to determine if it was operational,'' Pearce added.
</P>
<P>
   A salvage ship and a submersible camera, both from the Navy,
arrived Monday to help with the search over 24 square miles off Gay
Head, the western tip of Martha's Vineyard. But the going has been
slow, and divers returned to shore before dark, as rain rolled in.
Pearce said searchers had recovered ``numerous small pieces of the
airplane, primarily interior cabin molding, some of the rugs, some
of the cushions, a rudder pedal,'' plus ``the right main landing
gear, which included the wheel and the brake assembly but not the
strut that would extend up above it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been no other exterior sheet metal of the airplane
recovered,'' he added. The largest piece found so far, he said, was
a rug that is about two feet square.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The state police divers from the Underwater Recovery Unit worked
from sonar maps that have been color-coded to show objects with
90-degree angles, indicating possible manmade objects.
</P>
<P>
   The divers, who are working in seas that are about 80 feet deep,
have nine more promising spots, which they call ``targets of
opportunity,'' that investigators have identified on sonar maps.
Debris is being taken to a hangar here, where NTSB investigators
are poring over refueling and maintenance records for Kennedy's
plane. Investigators said they also are interviewing people who saw
the plane depart New Jersey, and pilots and flight instructors who
flew with Kennedy and might be able to provide background
information.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy had suffered a sports injury shortly before his death.
The Toronto Star reported Monday that Keith Stein, vice president
for corporate affairs of Magna International Inc., an auto parts
company in Aurora, Ontario, said that when Kennedy flew in on July
12 to discuss investment in George magazine, he brought along a
flight instructor.
</P>
<P>
   ``John indicated he wasn't comfortable flying by himself with a
broken foot,'' The Star quoted Stein as saying. ``He mentioned
something about needing help with the pedals.''
</P>
<P>
   Rear Adm. Richard Larrabee of the Coast Guard, who had
maintained publicly that searchers were looking for survivors long
past the time experts expected they could have lived in the chilly
ocean, showed a similar optimism Monday about the search, pointing
to the sophisticated equipment that had arrived Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A Coast Guard spokesman, Cmdr. Mike Lapinski, said he had
received several news media inquiries about the size of the search.
He said it was on the same scale as many others the Coast Guard
performs each year that receive little public notice, and added
that it was ``necessary and appropriate given the uncertainty and
the size of the search area.''
</P>
<P>
   In its statement, the Bessette family said: ``John and Carolyn
were true soulmates, and we hope to honor them in death in the
simple manner in which they chose to live their lives. We take
solace in the thought that together they comfort Lauren for
eternity.''
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference, President Clinton said he believed the
search should continue. ``John Kennedy and his sister and later his
wife were uncommonly kind to my daughter and my wife,'' he said.
``This has been a very difficult thing for us personally, as well
as because of my position. They are very strong people, and I think
they're carrying on as well as any human beings could, but they
need the support and prayers of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Ehud Barak, the new Israeli prime minister, appearing with
Clinton, called the deaths a ``tragedy that I believe touched
hearts of billions all around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy did not obtain his pilot's license until April 1998. He
said he had been fascinated by flight since childhood. In an
interview in 1995, replayed Monday on the ABC talk show ``The
View,'' Barbara Walters asked if he once had wanted to be an
astronaut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I did _ helicopter pilot, astronaut, something in the
air,'' he said. ``Growing up, there were always helicopters landing
on the front lawn of the White House, and usually one parent or
another would emerge from them, so I kind of got this thing about
helicopters.'' Asked when that changed, he laughed and said, ``I'm
not sure it's changed.''

EDITORIAL: POLITICS AND PUBLIC TV DON'T MIX 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, July 20:
</P>
<P>
   Organizations that depend partly on public money to survive
should not play politics _ or even appear to be playing politics.
In an extraordinary display of carelessness, this simple and
self-evident rule was breached by public television stations in
Boston, New York, San Francisco and Washington, which allowed lists
of their donors to be used by the Democratic Party. It appears the
stations were not consciously trying to help the Democrats.
Instead, in their zeal to raise money, they allowed brokers who
specialize in mailing lists to rent lists of their donors to other
groups that included the Democrats. In the process, they handed a
weapon to Republican opponents of public broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the Democratic National Committee had been allowed
to use names from the WGBH donor list in Boston was reported in May
by The Boston Globe. WGBH attributed the incident to new employees
not familiar with station policy. Amazingly, the Corporation for
Public Broadcasting, which distributes federal money to stations,
did nothing when it learned of the Globe report. Had it promptly
reported the case to Congress and its other stations _ and required
those stations to certify they were not doing similar things _ the
damage might have been minimized. Instead, the corporation waited
to act until reports surfaced on the actions of other stations.
</P>
<P>
   Robert T. Coonrod, the corporation's president, will testify
today at an emergency hearing of the House Telecommunications
subcommittee. He should come equipped with full details of the
various list swaps, as well as firm assurances that it will not
happen again. The last thing public television needs is a round of
funding cuts and an irresponsibly broad investigation of the sort
some congressional Republicans are considering.
</P>
<P>
   Public television is one of this country's great assets. Anyone
who doubts its continuing value may have missed the headline on
Monday's Times report on the coming fall season: ``Mainstream TV
Bets on `Gross-Out' Humor.''

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, July 20:
</P>
<P>
   What often separates champions from also-rans in sports is the
ability to close the deal, to finish strong so that certain victory
does not slip away. This has as much to do with mental stamina _ an
athlete's capacity to deal with nerves _ as it does with physical
talent. Last weekend two gifted athletes faced similar
high-pressure situations an ocean apart, with two entirely
different outcomes. In Carnoustie, Scotland, an unknown Frenchman
named Jean Van de Velde blew a seemingly insurmountable lead to
lose the British Open. In Yankee Stadium, David Cone coolly blew
away the final three Montreal batters to complete only the 16th
perfect game in major league history and the third for a Yankee.
</P>
<P>
   Cone had the upper hand throughout against a young and
inexperienced Montreal lineup, but when the eight and ninth innings
rolled around, he neither relaxed nor deviated from his game plan.
He retired the final six batters with the same mix of fastballs and
swerving sliders that had served him well all afternoon. Van de
Velde, by contrast, inexplicably abandoned the intelligent,
measured strategy that had given him a five-stroke lead entering
the final round at Carnoustie, a course that had reduced some of
the world's best golfers to blithering self-pity. Leading by three
strokes as he approached the treacherous 18th hole, and needing
only a double bogey to win, Van de Velde made all the wrong
decisions. He tried a long iron to the green when he should have
played the ball short, dumped a shot in a creek when again he
should have played short, then pitched into a bunker. He wound up
in a tie and lost in a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   There were, of course, differences. Cone was saved by two
sparkling plays by Chuck Knoblauch, the frequently erratic second
baseman. Van de Velde had nobody to back him up. But there were
similarities, too. As A. Bartlett Giamatti, the former commissioner
of baseball, once observed, baseball is a game of self-reliance, in
which ``the individual cannot hide from clear responsibility in a
crowd, as in football or Congress.'' This principle applies even
more starkly to golfers. Cone kept his focus, and passed the test
of self-reliance. Poor Van de Velde became a case study in Murphy's
Law.

WHO WILL BE McNOWN'S REPLACEMENT? 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This UCLA quarterback quagmire, now in its seventh
month, is all Cade McNown's fault.
</P>
<P>
   For all McNown's records and accomplishments, the most
impressive may be this: He did not miss a game in four years. Now
his toughness and resiliency, so crucial to UCLA's success, have
become its curse. McNown never gave the Bruins a chance to develop
a backup.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a month before training camp, the quarterback question
remains unanswered. The five competitors _ Drew Bennett, Scott
McEwan, Cory Paus, Ryan McCann and J.P. Losman _ are spending the
summer together. They are lifting weights together, running
together, throwing together, eating together and preparing together
for the most important weeks of their college careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of what happens in August will depend on what happens in
June and July,'' Bennett said. ``We're doing stuff every day. For
all of us, it's an important summer.''
</P>
<P>
   And one without supervision, for the NCAA prohibits
football-related contact between coaches and athletes until
training camp. No meetings. No supervised film sessions. The
quarterbacks spend as much time learning the playbook as sleep
patterns and summer school permit. Then they apply it during daily
workouts with receivers and defensive backs. If they have a
question, they ask each other.
</P>
<P>
   McNown himself is proof of this summer program. His great leap
forward came not during his junior season, when he led the nation
in passing efficiency, but during the previous summer, when hours
of study and application branded the offense to his cortex.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA coach Bob Toledo and offensive coordinator Al Borges are
concerned, but not worried, about the quarterback quagmire.
Although spring practice did not deliver a standout, it convinced
them of the unit's overall quality. They could have named a
temporary starter (probably Bennett) but figured there was no need
to eliminate anyone before the summer began.
</P>
<P>
   ``The summer is a big part of what success they're going to have
in training camp,'' Toledo said. ``We'll wait and let it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Conceivably, a starter and backup will emerge early in training
camp. Realistically, the Bruins may enter the final days of camp
without a No.1 guy. Potentially, they could play two quarterbacks
Sept.4 against Boise State.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be a very brief training period, one week, maybe less,''
Borges said. ``Then we'll try to trim it to two or three. But we
haven't committed to anything. That's just the tentative plan. The
bottom line is we want to keep them all alive and see how they
progress this summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Each player has his own concerns, and his own questions, as the
summer slowly expires.
</P>
<P>
   Summer of Uncertainty: Upon committing to UCLA three summers
ago, Thousand Oaks High's McEwan plotted his college career. He'd
redshirt as a rookie, then spend his second season learning from
McNown. When his third year arrived, he'd challenge for the
starting job.
</P>
<P>
   Year 3 is weeks away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I'd have to be ready to play my third year,'' McEwan
said. ``I told people when I committed that that would happen. Now
I have to make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   McEwan's position is unique. He's not as experienced as Bennett,
not as young as Paus, McCann and Losman. He can't avoid the
agonizing tick of the eligibility clock, a constant reminder he has
three seasons left. Decision time is approaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm not the starter this year, then I'm probably not going
to be the starter next year or the year after, unless there are
injuries,'' he said. ``If I don't get it now, the opportunity may
be gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Borges mentioned the thought of transferring if I don't
get the job. But I like UCLA so much. I'm 30 minutes from home. It
would kill me to have to transfer.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I also love football. That has helped motivate me. I have
so much to lose if I don't start.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, McEwan spent a week on Lake Havasu and worked at
Bel Air Country Club. This summer, he's all football, all the time.
He has a strong arm and solid delivery, but his agility must
improve. His emphasis this summer is throwing on the run _ a
prerequisite for UCLA's diverse attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the day he came to UCLA until today, McEwan is the most
improved quarterback we have,'' Borges said. ``His accuracy is very
good, and he understands the offense. But there's definitely a
sense of urgency.''
</P>
<P>
   Summer of Motion: The quarterback quagmire may not exist if not
for a quarterback quirk.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett is UCLA's best athlete. He is big and fast. He has a
38-inch vertical jump, great hands and quick feet. He's bright. He
understands the system better than his competitors. He'd probably
be the starter today if not for a flaw in his delivery that causes
his passes to wobble inaccurately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely had a decline in my accuracy last season, and I'm
trying to pick that up,'' said Bennett, a junior who was McNown's
backup in 1997 and '98. ``I completed 70 percent of my passes in
the spring of '98 and 55 percent in the spring of '99.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it is fundamentals. Sometimes, the ball doesn't come
off my hand like I want it to.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett's emphasis this summer is mechanics. He must improve his
balance and footwork. He must use the same motion _ and the same
release point _ until it becomes muscle memory. If he refines his
motion and improves accuracy, the quarterback competition may be
over before Bennett turns 21 on Aug. 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``Training camp is going to be so weird,'' he said. ``It's weird
to sit at home and think it's finally possible to win the starting
job on a top-25 team.''
</P>
<P>
   Summer of Reality: Losman had everything in place when he
graduated a semester early from Venice High. He was a top-rated
quarterback, and the Bruins had a vacancy. With his resume,
confidence and rocket arm, Losman expected to win the starting job
in spring practice _ two months before his senior prom.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he was overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot different than high school,'' he said. ``I got the
playbook the day I signed, and I didn't know what I was looking
at.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the question is whether Losman's looking elsewhere. He has
not been spotted in Westwood since summer workouts began, which
means he's losing ground by the week. Several Bruins said Losman
was so startled by the level of play that he's mulling a transfer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just been busy,'' he said when asked about his absence
from Spaulding Field. ``I'm coming back. I'll be there in August.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he planned to join his teammates this month, Losman
said he wasn't sure.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, his task is enormous. UCLA's playbook is four inches
thick and has dozens of plays, each with different protection
schemes and formations. Compared to a high school system, it's
astrophysics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has high expectations, and I wouldn't count him out,''
Borges said. ``But it's not easy to learn this offense. It took
Cade a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Summer of Reaction: Before spring practice began, Toledo told
his quarterbacks their most important duty was to avoid mistakes
and distribute the ball to UCLA's playmakers at running back and
receiver. McCann, a redshirt freshman, did not forget Toledo's
advice, not for a second, and that was his biggest mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than any of them, I think Ryan took it the wrong way,''
Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   An Agoura native, McCann was so concerned with avoiding mistakes
it paralyzed him. He didn't make any mistakes, but he didn't make
any plays, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the (final spring scrimmage), I had two roll-out passes,
and both times I had a guy open,'' he said. ``But I thought it was
a tight throw, so I tucked it in and ran for four yards. I should
have thrown both times. I can't play scared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking too much instead of playing. Hopefully,
watching film and throwing this summer will help with that.''
</P>
<P>
   McCann is a regular in the film room and often throws after
practice. Toledo and Borges laud his work habits. If anything, he's
too analytical, which short-circuits his reactions in competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, this summer is all about the mental part of the
game,'' he said. ``The main thing is learning the offense enough so
I can read and react.''
</P>
<P>
   Summer of Application: Paus hates the wait. In his perfect
world, there would be no summer _ only spring practice, a few days
of training camp, and the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just get the summer over,'' said Paus, a redshirt
freshman. ``It's been real repetitive, working out every day,
throwing four days a week. I just want to get going. If I have a
strength, it's that I do OK in the games. I felt more comfortable
in the scrimmages than in practice. I just want to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Several longtime UCLA watchers, enthralled with Paus' toughness
and leadership _ traits McNown carries in bulk _ have pronounced
him the eventual starter. While that may be premature, there's no
disputing the premise: Although he lacks Bennett's experience and
can't match Losman, McEwan or McCann for arm strength, Paus oozes
intangibles.
</P>
<P>
   In the three spring scrimmages, he was the only quarterback to
consistently move the offense. Even his greatest flaw is
reminiscent of a young McNown: Improbably confident, he'll force a
big play instead of making the safe play, sometimes leading to
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm in an OK position,'' he said. ``If we played
today, Drew would be the starter, and that's how it should be. But
we still have training camp to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of who grasps the offense best. You can study it
over and over and still not know it. You have to be able to apply
it on the field.''

EXPOS DEFEAT YANKEES, 6-4 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hideki Irabu was somewhat imperfect at Yankee Stadium
on Monday night. Then again, the Yankees have not been dominant at
home since storming out of April with a 10-1 record at the Stadium.
After David Cone's perfect game on Sunday against Montreal, they
were a mere 18-18 since then.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is 18-19, after a 6-4 loss to the Expos on Monday night,
although the Yankees remain in first place in the American League
East. They struggled against the struggling Expos, who met every
Yankees challenge and pulled ahead for good on a two-run single by
the light-hitting Shane Andrews in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The blow came against Ramiro Mendoza (3-6), the loser in relief
of Irabu, and it followed a two-out single by Michael Barrett and a
double by Brad Fullmer, who had a perfect night at the plate with
two doubles, a single and a home run.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu, who has not lost since May 25, had his moments, but he
just didn't have enough of them as he allowed four runs in six
innings. The winner as Montreal ended a six-game losing streak was
Steve Kline, the fourth of five Expos pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   In spring training, Irabu drew the wrath of George Steinbrenner,
the Yankees' principal owner, for failing to be alert enough in
covering first base. On Monday night the pitcher had a flashback to
that embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu was late covering first on a leadoff grounder to first by
Wilton Guererro in the third, but he was saved by Tino Martinez's
alert pickup. Martinez slid feet first into the bag to make the
putout.
</P>
<P>
   No one could rescue Irabu in the sixth inning, when he yielded a
two-run homer to Fullmer that gave the Expos a 4-2 edge.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter tied the score in the Yankees' seventh with a
two-run double, but the Expos' two-out rally in the eighth regained
the lead for Montreal, and Ugueth Urbina nailed the victory down
with a 1-2-3 ninth inning, his 20th save in 26 chances.
</P>
<P>
   The teams carried a 2-2 tie into the sixth inning in a game that
lost any sense of drama when the Expos' third batter of the game,
Rondell White, singled. That was the first Montreal batter to reach
base after Sunday's 27 outs in a row and the first two on Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   An inning later, the Expos opened the scoring when Fullmer
doubled home Barrett. It became a 2-0 lead in the third on White's
double that scored Terry Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees inched back in their third, barely making good on a
bases-filled, none-out situation. Paul O'Neill grounded into a
double play to score Scott Brosius.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Yankees tied the score in the fifth when Jorge
Posada scored from third base on a wild pitch, the deadlock hardly
lasted. In the top of the sixth, Fullmer crushed an Irabu delivery
deep into the right-field bleachers, a two-run shot that made it
4-2.
