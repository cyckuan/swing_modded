<HEADLINE> Investigators seek clues in pier collapse  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN POET
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Investigators removed most of the wooden
planks and plastic chairs from the Delaware River on Friday in a
search for clues to why a nightclub pier collapsed sending dozens
of people into the cool water and killing three women.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Franklin-Suber, Mayor John Street's chief of staff,
said all but two of the 41 people they believe were dropped into
the river had been accounted for. She said authorities don't know
if the two simply haven't checked in with authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're concerned and we're not going to give up until they're
accounted for,'' Franklin-Suber said. ''They could be home safe.
They could have left the area.''
</P>
<P>
   City clean-up crews removed most of the debris floating in the
river and stabilized the wrecked pier late Friday, paving the way
for authorities to begin a full-scale investigation Saturday
morning, Franklin-Suber said. Engineers will first examine of the
site by boat launched from the New Jersey shore, then divers will
get a closer look.
</P>
<P>
   All the 20 or so other piers that line the waterfront were ruled
structurally sound by city inspectors late Friday, Franklin-Suber
said. The mayor ordered inspections of all the piers, many of which
are believed to be 100 years old. The former industrial area along
the river is now dotted with restaurants and nightclubs catering to
a college-aged crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our concern at this point is really to make sure that when
people come out here tonight to visit some of these other piers
that people are safe,'' Fire Commissioner Harold Hairston said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, people at the open-air nightclub Heat said
they had almost no time to react when the pier began falling away
under their feet, plunging dozens of people into the murky water.
One victim said the frantic scene was similar to one in the movie
''Titanic,'' where people ran up an inclined surface as it sank
into the water.
</P>
<P>
   After they hit the cool water, those dropped into the river
desperately tried to reach the surface through a mess of wooden
planks and plastic furniture. An overhead tent fell into the water,
blanketing them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard a loud crash, and then all hell broke loose. I went
straight down ... then I was just trying to fight my way up,'' said
bartender Joseph Capaci, 28, of Villanova.
</P>
<P>
   One of the club's employees, Lawrence Price, said he saw a
four-inch crack on the pier that he was told Thursday to cover with
sheet metal. He said he had seen it a week earlier, but it had
grown larger.
</P>
<P>
   Killed were DeAnn White, 25, of Philadelphia; Jean Ferraro, 27,
of Cherry Hill, N.J.; and Monica Rodriguez, 21, also of Cherry
Hill. They were reportedly at the club celebrating White's
birthday, which would have been Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Grief counselors were brought in Friday to the Thomas H. Kean
New Jersey State Aquarium in Camden, N.J., where the three worked.
White, 25, was the aquarium's public relations director, Ferraro
was the marketing director and Rodriguez was a part-time special
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   All but six of the 37 injured have been treated and released.
The others remain in area hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the company that owns Heat and the Moshulu said
he was working near the pier Thursday night and stayed on the scene
until early Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am distraught and saddened by the tragic accident at Pier
34,'' Eli Karetny, president of HMS Ventures Inc., said in a
statement released Friday. ''I have been involved in restaurant
operations from the pier for many years. The safety of our patrons
has always been of utmost importance. My heart goes out to all our
patrons and employees who were involved and their families.''
</P>
<P>
   Karetny said he was cooperating with investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The city Department of Licenses and Inspections is seeking help
from a forensic engineering firm that specializes in pier design.
The Army Corps of Engineers, responsible for the Delaware River
shipping channel, is helping with clean-up and as a technical
consultant, spokesman Ed Voigt said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have the expertise to handle this. It's just too big
for us,'' Licenses and Inspections Commissioner Ed McLaughlin said.
</P>
<P>
   City homicide detectives also were investigating, which police
said is routine after a fatal accident.
</P>
<P>
   The river was closed to all ship traffic most of Friday. It
reopened around 11 p.m., though boats had to be escorted by the
Coast Guard overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Harris, a Drexel University engineering professor, said
many of the piers were originally built to support warehouses and
should be able to withstand the weight of a night club.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some are in very bad shape and some are in very good shape,
relatively. It depends on the owner and what transpired,'' Harris
said.
</P>
<P>
   The nightclub opened this month next to the historic Moshulu
ship-turned-restaurant. The restaurant is built into the
394-foot-long tall ship, a turn-of-the-century German cargo ship
that has been converted into an upscale restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, speaking at a Democratic fund-raiser at
Philadelphia City Hall, expressed his sympathy to the city for the
pier accident and said he was being briefed by the Coast Guard and
local officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know it's a painful thing for the city and I'd like to say
how sorry I am,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Jury Finds Couple Guilty of Killing  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT MACY
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A couple was convicted Friday of killing a
casino heir after a trial that captivated this gambling community
with tales of love, drug addiction and buried treasure.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Binion, who lost his casino license because of drug use and
association with a mob figure, died Sept. 17, 1998. Prosecutors
said he was forced to ingest of a lethal dose of heroin and the
prescription sedative Xanax and was then suffocated.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Murphy, who was Binion's live-in girlfriend, and Rick
Tabish, her lover, were charged with murder nine months later.
Convicted of murder and other charges, they could be sentenced to
life in prison without the possibility of parole. The sentencing
phase was to begin Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors would not comment. Lawyers for Murphy and Tabish
said they would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors claimed the pair killed Binion when he threatened to
cut Murphy out of his will, then ransacked his home of cash and
other valuables before trying to loot a buried vault of $7 million
in silver.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys contended Binion, the 55-year-old son of
casino legend Benny Binion, died of an accidental drug overdose or
committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The death began a bitter civil court battle between Murphy and
the powerful Binion estate over her share of his $55 million will --
$300,000 in cash, his $900,000 home and its contents, and proceeds
from a $1 million life insurance policy.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors claimed Murphy, 28, and Tabish, 35, a Missoula,
Mont., contractor, began an affair in early 1998 and Binion ordered
her out of his will when he learned of it.
</P>
<P>
   The day before his death, Binion called his attorney, telling
him to take Murphy out of the will ''if she doesn't kill me
tonight. If I'm dead, you'll know what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day Binion filled a prescription for 120 Xanax
tablets prescribed by a doctor and summoned his drug dealer, who
delivered 12 balloons of black tar heroin.
</P>
<P>
   The next day Murphy told a maid not to come to work because
Binion, on a heroin binge, had been sick all night and they were
going to sleep in.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses testified she went to lunch at a posh restaurant near
their home, then returned to find the lifeless body of Binion in
his den.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy determined death was due to a lethal dose of heroin
and Xanax. The death was ruled a homicide six months later.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors contended Murphy and Tabish wasted no time in
latching onto Binion's valuables. They claim the pair ransacked his
home immediately after his death.
</P>
<P>
   Then, 36 hours after Binion died, Tabish and two others were
arrested for breaking into a concrete vault buried about 60 miles
west of here. The vault contained about $7 million in silver bars
and rare coins Binion had removed weeks earlier from the basement
of his family's downtown Horseshoe Casino.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Murphy won the right to her share of the Binion estate
when a judge ruled that Binion had to be present and sign a new
will before it could take legally effect. That decision is on
appeal to the state Supreme Court.

<HEADLINE> NRA May Open Times Square Store  </HEADLINE>
By LUKAS I. ALPERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP)-- The sports-themed restaurants in Times Square
might be getting a new neighbor -- the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   ''More Americans participate in shooting sports than in
basketball, hockey, baseball, soccer and other sports,'' NRA
Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre said at a news conference
announcing a theme restaurant-store at the group's annual
convention in Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   NRASports Blast will offer virtual-reality trap and skeet
shooting, outdoor clothing and hunting accessories. It will also
feature a restaurant -- The N.R.A. Grille-- which will serve wild
game. But it won't sell guns.
</P>
<P>
   If NRASports Blast opens -- LaPierre said no lease has been
signed and he did not know when the store would open -- it will pit
itself against a slew of theme restaurants and stores in the Time
Square area. Besides ESPNZone, there's also Disney store, the
All-Star Cafe and the WWF store and restaurant. Not far away is a
Harley Davidson restaurant, Mars 2112, Planet Hollywood and Hard
Rock Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anyone can open a restaurant here, and as long as it is a
legal establishment we would certainly seek to make sure they are
prosperous,'' said Brendan Sexton, the president of the Times
Square Business Improvement district.
</P>
<P>
   But Sexton expressed some concern.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a time when Times Square was associated with a
climate of violence and weapons. That culture and symbolism is
something that we have been extremely glad to get away from,''
Sexton said.
</P>
<P>
   To many the idea of opening an NRA outlet in the heart of New
York City seems a bit unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ''What? Do you have to shoot at a menu to pick your meal?'' said
Carlos Azaceta, an advertising executive from Hoboken, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   But to others, the idea seemed to fit in quite well in the
atmosphere of political slugfests, lunatic cab drivers, and
stinking subway cars the city is best known for.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know quite how well this is going to work. But hey,
this is New York. Anything goes,'' said Joyce Keller, a computer
programmer from Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Josh Sugarmann, executive director of the Violence Policy
Center, said that the proposal shows the NRA is ''bizarrely out of
sync'' with mainstream America.
</P>
<P>
   ''What will their sign say, 'Over a Million Killed'?'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Colo.'s Bourque Has Winning Return  </HEADLINE>
By AARON J. LOPEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- There's still a lot of life left in Ray Bourque's
39-year-old legs.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque, who missed four playoff games with a knee injury, made
a triumphant return to the Colorado lineup Friday night, playing a
game-high 35 minutes, 35 seconds in the Avalanche's 2-0 victory
over the Dallas Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt awesome,'' Bourque said. ''As the game went on, I just
felt very comfortable. It was nice to get into a game and know that
I'm over the hump and I'm fine. ... If there was any doubt, I think
everybody realizes that I'm all set to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing for the first time since injuring his left knee on May
1, the defenseman's night started innocently enough, with his first
shift lasting less than 20 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque would get plenty more opportunities, logging much of his
ice time on special teams as Colorado killed three Dallas penalties
and went 1-for-10 on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he wasn't ready to play that ice time and play the way Ray
Bourque can, then I don't think they would have dressed him,''
Colorado forward Dave Reid said. ''In that respect, it wasn't a
surprise he played so much because even he was saying, if he was
going to play, he was going to play the way he always plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque and Aaron Miller also did an admirable job stifling
Dallas' top line, limiting Mike Modano, Brett Hull and Jere
Lehtinen to a combined five shots.
</P>
<P>
   The defensive performance came with Adam Foote -- Bourque's usual
partner -- watching from the stands with an eye injury sustained in
the early minutes of Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ''He gave them a big lift,'' Modano said of Bourque. ''It fills
a big hole that Foote's left. The other guys played great games. In
time of desperation and times of pressure, they were performers.''
</P>
<P>
   With his teammates, fans and coach anxious to see how Bourque's
knee would hold up, he was able to avoid collisions and jarring
hits as Colorado took a 2-1 lead in the best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   When told how many minutes Bourque played, 23-year-old teammate
Chris Drury was impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's pretty amazing with his age and obviously his injury,
especially in this altitude. I mean, I was feeling it in the first
period,'' Drury said. ''It's a credit to him and how hard he
works.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque, seeking his first Stanley Cup title in 21 seasons,
injured his knee in Game 3 of the conference semifinals and
benefited from a schedule that has included just two games in 14
days.
</P>
<P>
   His return came just in time for the Avalanche, who lost Foote
to an eye injury 2:42 into their Game 2 loss in Dallas. Foote said
his vision is fine, but he does not know when or if he will return
for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Foote and Bourque formed Colorado's most effective defensive
tandem while playing against Phoenix's top line in the first round
and Detroit in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Avalanche coach Bob Hartley teamed Bourque with Miller, who has
not missed a game in the postseason despite breaking his jaw in the
regular-season finale against Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just tried to play my game,'' Miller said. ''I'm not going
to try to put (Foote's) No. 52 on my jersey. He's a great player. I
just tried to pick up the slack, but it takes 20 guys to cover for
an Adam Foote.''

<HEADLINE> Advocates: Mentally ill inmates fueling prison increases  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- To Dr. Bert Pepper, the burgeoning
population of federal, state and local prisons should prompt those
not behind bars to demand answers.
</P>
<P>
   There are now more than 2 million people incarcerated in the
United States, or about 10 times as many as in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   Has there really been a 10-fold increase in criminal behavior in
this country in the past two generations?
</P>
<P>
   Pepper, a psychiatrist, said it is clear there has not been. Nor
does he believe that the jump in the size of the state's prison
system over that same period -- from 19,000 to 72,000 -- can be
explained by the presence of three times as many criminals in New
York society.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Pepper is among the advocates for the mentally ill who
believe the influx of the imprisoned is in part a function of a
burgeoning number of people who are not getting proper care for
mental problems.
</P>
<P>
   Pepper believes it is hardly a coincidence that while the prison
population has soared, the number of beds available in mental
institutions in New York state has nose-dived, from 93,000 in the
mid-1950s to about 6,000 today.
</P>
<P>
   Where have those once institutionalized mentally ill people -- or
at least their modern-day counterparts -- gone? Pepper, once a
deputy mental health commissioner in New York, estimates that
23,000 are in state prisons and 13,000 are in local jails.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since everybody has to be some place ... society has built
them jail cells,'' Pepper said.
</P>
<P>
   Another 24,000 are homeless and 4,000 are living in shelters,
Pepper estimated.
</P>
<P>
   As the mental institution ''balloon'' has been deflated in an
effort to warehouse fewer ill people in hospitals and get them
functioning in society, the prison and jail balloon has been pumped
up ever higher, he argued.
</P>
<P>
   This notion has a tongue-twister of a name among mental health
advocates -- ''transinstitutionalization.''
</P>
<P>
   ''A specific portion (of the mentally ill) has been shifted from
the hospitals and the institutions ... usually by way of the
streets, to prisons and jails,'' said Joseph Glazer, head of the
Mental Health Association of New York State.
</P>
<P>
   Glazer's group and others argue that this process amounts to the
criminalization of mental illness in modern-day American society.
</P>
<P>
   They do not contend that the mentally ill are not committing
crimes which land them in state prison or local jails. But they say
criminal behavior is often a byproduct of the greater failure of
mental health treatment systems to identify people's problems and
make sure they are dealt with.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Pepper believes, ''The majority of drug offenders
are mentally ill.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepper, who also once headed Maryland's state mental health
system, said when he speaks to jail wardens or prison
superintendents, he tells them, ''Congratulations,'' you have just
become head of a ''mental hospital full of drug addicts -- That's
our prisons today.''
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Abate, a former state senator who once headed New York
City's jail system, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jail has become the primary care setting for the mentally ill,
especially the homeless,'' she said. ''Jails have become
repositories of the mentally ill in our communities.''
</P>
<P>
   As such, jails and prisons are poor places for mentally ill
people to get better, the advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   In the entire New York City corrections system, with some
126,000 new admissions each year, there are only 368 beds where
mentally ill inmates get 24-hour care and supervision.
</P>
<P>
   In the state prison system, officials say there are about 850
beds set aside in the system for inmates needing more acute,
intensive mental treatment. State officials say about 7,500 inmates
in all receive in- or outpatient mental health treatment.
</P>
<P>
   At a forum in Albany this week sponsored by Glazer's group,
former chief state judge Sol Wachtler said the criminal justice and
the mental health systems have failed the mentally ill at all
levels.
</P>
<P>
   He included the judiciary in that category. Forced to resign in
disgrace after an arrest he blames on an untreated manic depressive
condition, Wachtler said the judge at his own trial was like judges
most everywhere -- she had little knowledge about the effects of
mental problems on the defendants coming before her.
</P>
<P>
   While not insane by the stringent standards of the law,
thousands upon thousands of inmates are in jails and prisons
because of behavior created by mental problems, Wachtler said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The judges are not able to draw distinctions,'' Wachtler said.

<HEADLINE> Bragman says his support slips, but vows to continue  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Partisans of Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver
are declaring him the winner of a short, sharp challenge to his
leadership position mounted by former Majority Leader Michael
Bragman.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is over now,'' Assemblyman Steven Sanders of Manhattan said
Friday. Another Manhattan assemblyman, Richard Gottfried, said,
''It certainly seems to be a mopping-up operation at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   A third Silver supporter, Ronald Canestrari of Albany County,
agreed that, ''Certainly, it is safe to say the speaker will remain
the speaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Bragman, however, said he would go forward with a resolution
Monday which seeks to suspend the rules of the Assembly so members
can elect a new speaker.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Bragman promised, Silver will discover that a
''significant'' number of Democrats in the Assembly are unhappy
with him and that changes must be made in how the chamber is run.
</P>
<P>
   But Bragman conceded that the support of at least 50 Assembly
Democrats which he thought he had on Wednesday -- enough to be
elected speaker among the 98 Assembly Democrats -- was eroding in
the face of what he called ''atrocious'' arm-twisting by Silver and
those close to the speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ''Am I still in a position to win? I don't know,'' he told The
Associated Press Friday. ''But you know what? There's going to be
change here. Shelly Silver must go as the speaker of the New York
state Assembly.''
</P>
<P>
   Bragman said he was ''not even looking at me being speaker''
anymore, just in ''leading this conference in a new direction.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is about reform,'' he said. ''I don't care what the
penalties are to me, I don't care what the retribution is.''
</P>
<P>
   Bragman, from the Onondaga County suburb of Cicero, said there
might still be three dozen Democrats on Monday willing to oppose
Silver, but Silver's partisan scoffed at that estimate.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is just ridiculous,'' Sanders said. ''He has one of those
two digits, but not the two put together. By the end of the day
today any support that he has had will have evaporated into single
digits.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those Bragman supporters, Martin Luster of Tompkins
County, said Friday that legislators were ''growing weary'' with
the incessant telephone conversations with each side and among
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think no matter what happens, Speaker Silver now knows there
are a substantial number of his colleagues in the conference who
are not in agreement with him,'' Luster said.
</P>
<P>
   Luster added, ''Maybe he (Silver) will wind up winning the
battle, but the message is loud and clear.''
</P>
<P>
   A crucial point in the power struggle came on Thursday night
when Assemblyman Robert Ramirez, who is also Bronx County
Democratic leader, showed up arm-in-arm with Silver at a
fund-raiser for Assembly Democrats in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am absolutely, unequivocally, 100 percent behind Speaker
Sheldon Silver,'' Ramirez said.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman had been trying to woo Ramirez to his side.
</P>
<P>
   Silver forces on Friday said Queens Democratic leader Tom
Manton, a Bragman supporter, had made peace overtures to the
speaker. But both Manton and Bragman staunchly denied on Friday
that Manton was seeking any such accommodation.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman blamed hardball tactics by Silver for costing him
support. That included threats by the speaker to strip committee
chairmanships from Bragman backers, to run Democratic primary
opponents against them and to redraw their district lines next year
in ways that they could not hope to win re-election starting in
2002, according to Bragman.
</P>
<P>
   Silver spokeswoman Patricia Lynch denied another Bragman claim
that the speaker had waded into a murky ethical waters by having
lobbyists trying to whip up support for Silver among lawmakers.
Bragman said those same lobbyists will be back trying to curry
favor in the Assembly for legislation their clients want once the
leadership battle is over.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman said the ''badgering'' of legislators by lobbyists is
''beyond the law'' and is ''going to have repercussions beyond
these two or three days.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The former majority leader is not in a position at this time
to make outrageous statements such as those,'' Lynch countered.
''It's unfortunate that he continues to try to divide this
conference with such outrageous, inaccurate statements. He should
know better, but then again he should have known better on
Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   Bragman, an assemblyman since 1980 and majority leader since
1994, said that no matter how the struggle with Silver plays out,
he will not resign from the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will complete this term,'' he said. ''I don't care if I'm
sitting at a desk in the basement. I don't care if I have no
resources available. I will not be threatened.''
</P>
<P>
   Next to Silver, Bragman had the most resources available to an
individual legislator as majority leader. He got a $34,500 a year
stipend as majority leader.

<HEADLINE> Snakebite victim knew instantly his life was at risk  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Anthony Cavallaro knew the instant he felt
the needle-sharp fangs of his pet Gaboon viper pierce his hand his
life was in danger.
</P>
<P>
   The Buffalo man grabbed a razor blade and sliced at his flesh
then thrust his hand to his mouth to suck the venom. A friend
called 911 as Cavallaro, in intense pain as the venom spread, began
to vomit.
</P>
<P>
   ''His arm swelled up four times its normal size and it was
turning black,'' Cavallaro's brother, Kevin, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Cavallaro, 40, had been changing the snake's water
Wednesday evening when it struck. Though hospitalized in intensive
care, Cavallaro was improving and able to talk Friday, family
members said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said 'I'm a trooper. I'm pulling through this,''' said his
brother.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot Gaboon viper is part of a collection of exotic pets
that also includes a cobra, a rattlesnake, a copperhead, two boa
constrictors and an 8-foot alligator named Albert which Cavallaro
has raised in his home.
</P>
<P>
   The Gaboon viper, whose gray and brown skin resembles an
Oriental carpet, is one of the deadliest venomous reptiles. Native
to South and West Africa, it has the longest fangs of any snake, up
to two inches. Gaboons are capable of biting to the bone and
injecting large quantities of highly toxic venom which attacks
blood and muscle tissue.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is immediate pain and swelling follows in just
minutes,'' said Clyde Peeling, owner of Clyde Peeling's Reptiland
in Allenwood, Pa. Depending on the size of the snake and the amount
of venom injected, ''It could conceivably kill you in less than an
hour but a more likely scenario is 18 hours or two days.''
</P>
<P>
   With Cavallaro fading, emergency workers worked against time to
find serum known as ''antivenin'' to counter the venom's effects.
</P>
<P>
   A call went to the Buffalo Zoo, but with no Gaboon vipers in its
reptile house, there was no antivenin on hand. Zoo officials
advised emergency workers to call Western New York Poison Control,
who in turn called counterparts in Arizona, keepers of a master
list of zoos and the antivenins they stock.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Bronx Zoo was identified as the closest source,'' said
Rick Paine, the Buffalo Zoo's interim president. The serum was
flown in and administered.
</P>
<P>
   ''Zoos have networked for years to make sure there is a master
list so in case of an emergency there is a very efficient mechanism
to locate the antivenin,'' Paine said.
</P>
<P>
   Cavallaro has permits for all of his animals and shows the
snakes, poisonous except for the boa constrictors, his brother
said. While the snakes are housed in large windowed cases, the
alligator wanders the house, often sliding into the bathtub for a
dip.
</P>
<P>
   ''He treats these things like they're humans,'' Kevin Cavallaro
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gaboon viper remained in its aquarium Friday, barely moving,
as is typical of the species.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can get lulled into a false sense of security working
around them because they are so lethargic,'' Peeling said. ''Unless
you've seen them kill a rat or something and you realize they are
lightning quick with their bite you might be tempted to believe
they're almost tame and that's certainly not the case.''
</P>
<P>
   A handler at the Long Island Reptile Expo &AMP; Museum was
hospitalized after being bit by a Gaboon viper in December 1997. In
1983, a 16-year-old nearly died after being attacked by two Gaboon
snakes that he allegedly tried to steal from the National Zoo in
Washington.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Agreement Near  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The world's nuclear haves and have-nots
neared agreement late Friday on a new disarmament agenda, but a
final accord was stalled by a dispute between Iraq and the United
States over Baghdad's alleged efforts to develop nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ''The entire conference is being held hostage with regard to the
situation in Iraq,'' said Rebecca Johnson, editor of ''Disarmament
Diplomacy,'' a monthly arms control journal.
</P>
<P>
   The four-week conference to review the Nuclear Nonproliferation
Treaty was scheduled to end Friday, but negotiations among the 187
signatories to the accord dragged on.
</P>
<P>
   The conference president, Algerian U.N. Ambassador Abdallah
Baali, was working to try to resolve the remaining differences
ahead of a plenary session to consider a final document.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's U.N. Ambassador Saeed Hasan said Baghdad would accept a
factual account of the International Atomic Energy Agency's January
inspection of its nuclear reactors -- but was vehemently opposed to
any mention of Security Council resolutions that placed Iraq under
sanctions until its weapons of mass destruction are eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Americans want to include that this inspection does not
substitute for the obligations of Iraq under Security Council
resolutions,'' Hasan said. ''We rejected that proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraq proposed new language late Friday and the ambassador
expressed hope that it would be accepted by the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, delegates reached a consensus on a document
reviewing progress on disarmament since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   At the insistence of the five established nuclear powers, all
references were dropped to the 35,000 nuclear weapons still in
their arsenals and the thousands still on hair-trigger alert.
</P>
<P>
   Countries without nuclear weapons had wanted the figures -- which
came directly from Secretary-General Kofi Annan's opening speech to
the conference -- to be included, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   In a key breakthrough on Thursday, the five nuclear powers
agreed to ''an unequivocal undertaking'' to eliminate their nuclear
arsenals, a decision praised by several non-nuclear countries.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement specified no timetable, and delegates said it
would take many years to achieve a nuclear-free world.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of opposition, China agreed to go along with a call
for increased transparency by the nuclear weapon states regarding
their nuclear weapons capabilities, which means Beijing must
provide information about its nuclear capabilities, Johnson said.

<HEADLINE> Poison Kills Fish in Washington  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A poison spill has killed tens of thousands of
fish over the past two days in Rock Creek, one of the main natural
attractions in the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   The unidentified poison entered the water in Maryland's
Montgomery County and affected fish from just south of the Walter
Reed Army Medical Center Annex to the Potomac River, The Washington
Post reported in Saturday editions. Three dozen species of fish,
including shiners and catfish, were affected.
</P>
<P>
   The National Park Service has placed the creek off-limits for
wading or fishing, although officials expect the poison to
dissipate quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Luckett, a fish kill investigator with the Maryland
Department of the Environment, tlold the Post that the creek will
still show effects of the kill a year from now.
</P>
<P>
   The unknown poison apparently entered the creek Wednesday or
Thursday at a point near an industrial park, the newspaper said.
County, state and federal agency officials said they were trying to
determine the nature of the poison and how it entered the creek.

<HEADLINE> Twins 3, Athletics 2  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS GEORGATOS
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Brad Radke pitched a three-hitter for his
first complete game of the season and Ron Coomer doubled home the
go-ahead run Friday night to lead the Minnesota Twins over the
Oakland Athletics 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Jacque Jones homered leading off the game and rookie Matt LeCroy
added a game-tying RBI double for the Twins, who sent the A's to
their season-high fourth straight loss. It was also Oakland's major
league-high 11th one-run loss of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Radke (3-4), who struck out five and walked three, won for the
first time since April 23, when he had a 5-4 decision over Texas.
He broke a string of two losses and two no decisions over the last
month in matching his career-low for hits in a game. He has two
other three-hitters, the last on June 18, 1996 at New York.
</P>
<P>
   Radke did not allow a hit over the last five innings following
Ben Grieve's fourth inning single, retiring his final 15 batters.
</P>
<P>
   It was his first complete game since last Sept. 5 at Tampa Bay
and the 19th of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Heredia (5-3) saw his four-game winning streak snapped after
allowing three runs and eight hits in eight innings. He struck out
two and walked five, two of whom scored.
</P>
<P>
   With the score tied at 2-all, Denny Hocking drew a one-out walk
in the fifth and, after Matt Lawton grounded out and Heredia's wild
pitch moved Hocking to third, Coomer doubled to put the Twins up by
a run.
</P>
<P>
   Jones sent Heredia's first pitch into the left-field seats. But
Ramon Hernandez singled with one out in the third, Oakland's first
hit, and Terrence Long followed with a homer.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota evened the score when Corey Koskie led off the fourth
with a walk and scored on LeCroy's two-out double.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Brian Buchanan, recalled from Triple A Salt Lake City on
Wednesday, singled off Heredia's glove in the fifth for his first
major league hit. He also robbed Miguel Tejada of a double with a
leaping catch against the right field wall in the seventh. ...
Oakland left-handed reliever Mike Magnante is day to day after
spraining his left ankle while delivering a pitch Thursday night.
... The A's fell to 9-15 at home, the second-worst in the league
behind Tampa Bay (5-10). ... The only other complete game by a
Twins pitcher was by Joe Mays on May 7 against Detroit.

<HEADLINE> Brewers 11, Giants 10, 10 Innings  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Ron Belliard's 10th-inning sacrifice fly scored
pinch-runner James Mouton and the Milwaukee Brewers got a wild
11-10 victory Friday night over the San Francisco Giants, who lost
their seventh straight.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Blanco drew a walk from Robb Nen (0-1) to open the 10th.
Mouton ran for Blanco and stole second, and pinch-hitter Mark
Sweeney sacrificed.
</P>
<P>
   Belliard hit a fly to Marvin Benard mid-right field, and a
sliding Mouton beat catcher Bobby Estalella's tag by inches at the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee erased a five-run deficit in the seventh inning and
blew a three-run lead in the eighth. The game was just the latest
chapter in an extraordinarily unpleasant homestand for the Brewers,
who won a 16-inning game against Houston on Tuesday before getting
rained out on Wednesday and Thursday nights.
</P>
<P>
   Brewers closer Bob Wickman (1-1) pitched two scoreless innings
for the victory. The first nine innings of Friday's game took more
than four hours to play, and the final game time was 4:21.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers, whose .241 team batting average entering was the
majors' worst, scored eight runs in the seventh while pounding
Livan Hernandez and relievers Aaron Fultz and Ben Weber.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Bonds returned to San Francisco's lineup and hit his 16th
home run. When he left in the sixth, the Giants were cruising with
a 7-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, eight straight batters reached base for
Milwaukee. Charlie Hayes hit a three-run double off Fultz to cut
San Francisco's lead to 7-6 and, after Weber entered the game, Lyle
Mouton hit a game-tying triple.
</P>
<P>
   Following a walk to Marquis Grissom, Jose Hernandez tripled in
two runs and Henry Blanco doubled in Hernandez. Alan Embree
relieved Weber and got two fly balls to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The eight runs and two triples equaled the Brewers' NL team
records for one inning.
</P>
<P>
   But the offensive fireworks were only beginning. The Giants
touched setup man David Weathers for a run-scoring double by
Estalella and a game-tying two-run single by Armando Rios, who
finished with four RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   With the score tied at 10 in the ninth, Wickman allowed San
Francisco to load the bases with one out. But third baseman Jose
Hernandez's alert throw got a forceout at the plate, and Wickman
struck out Felipe Crespo.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds, who had three RBIs, missed the Giants' previous three
games after a painful back injury he originally thought might put
him out for the season. He showed no ill effects against the
Brewers, hitting a two-run homer to deep center and adding a
sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco, swept in three-game series at Colorado and
Atlanta, still hasn't won on its nine-game road trip. Jeff Kent had
three hits for the injury-plagued Giants, who also lost J.T. Snow
in the eighth with tightness in his right groin.
</P>
<P>
   The driving rainstorms that postponed Milwaukee's games against
Houston on Wednesday and Thursday were gone, but the gametime
temperature at County Stadium was 44 degrees. Most of the crowd of
12,842 was bundled up in winter coats and gloves.
</P>
<P>
   Rios had a two-run double in the seventh that appeared to break
open the game for San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Jeromy Burnitz became the latest Brewers player to lose
control of his bat in the cold weather. In the sixth inning,
Burnitz's bat flew into the stands behind the Brewers' dugout. No
one was injured. Nearly three weeks ago, Geoff Jenkins broke a bone
in his finger when it collided with the nob of his bat as he lost
control. Jenkins' bat flew into the stands behind home plate and
broke the arm of a female spectator. ... Mueller singled in the
first inning to extend his hitting streak to 15 games. He stayed in
the Giants' lineup even though Russ Davis returned to the team
after missing two games while attending to personal matters.

<HEADLINE> Knicks Comeback Forces Game 7  </HEADLINE>
By HAL BOCK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- By now, the Miami Heat must be talking to
themselves, wondering what it takes to put the New York Knicks
away.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat will try once more on Sunday in Game 7 of this seesaw
series after the Knicks overcame an 18-point deficit for a 72-70
victory Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   In each of the last two years, the Heat have dropped a playoff
elimination game at home to the Knicks. Now they had their chance
to turn the tables. Instead, the tables got turned on them.
</P>
<P>
   Miami owned this game almost all night. Knicks coach Jeff Van
Gundy lamented over how sometimes his team played like it was old.
And that was before the Heat built an 18-point first-half lead
against a Knicks team that played lackadaisical, listless
basketball for the first 24 minutes, looking, well, very old.
</P>
<P>
   New York seemed done, drowning in a sea of technical fouls and
deliberate fouls, lane violations and turnovers in the lane.
Everything that could go wrong did go wrong and Miami led by 15 at
the half.
</P>
<P>
   Then, all at once, the lead began to disappear. Suddenly, the
shots that missed badly for the Knicks in the first half, began
falling. The double-digit deficit dwindled from 15 to 10 to five at
the start of the fourth quarter, to two inside of four minutes.
Finally, it was gone completely, the game tied at 70.
</P>
<P>
   Then Allan Houston nailed two foul shots for the winning points
and when Anthony Carter missed a 3-point attempt at the end, the
Heat had to begin thinking about Game 7 and the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Again.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were very disappointed,'' coach Pat Riley said of the
Heat. ''They went into the locker room like it was their last
chance. It wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   With these two teams, it never seems to be.
</P>
<P>
   Riley said he had no problem with the foul call on Dan Majerle
that sent Houston to the line.
</P>
<P>
   ''We felt they would go to Allan,'' Riley said. ''It was a step
out pick and roll. I'm not making excuses. It was a tough call at
that point.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley had warned his team at halftime that even with the
15-point lead, they weren't really safe.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told them coming out that a lot would be determined in the
first four or five minutes of the second half,'' he said. ''We knew
they had a rush in them.''
</P>
<P>
   New York hit its first five shots to get right back in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even though they made a great push, we led throughout the
second half. We were up six with three minutes to play,'' Riley
said. ''They made a great run but we kept the lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Right up until the end. Almost.
</P>
<P>
   So now these two rivals will tip it off one more time for the
right to play the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll deal with it,'' Riley said. ''We will get right down to
what it's all about. It's two teams with the best game on Sunday.''

<HEADLINE> Knicks 72, Heat 70  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- It took an incredible comeback to do it, and
that's exactly what New York summoned to send another Knicks-Heat
series back to Miami for yet another winner-take-all,
loser-goes-home finale.
</P>
<P>
   Just when it looked like they were dead, the Knicks reached deep
down and managed a dramatic rally from an 18-point deficit.
Overcoming Miami's relentless defense and their own self-doubts
after a miserable first half, the Knicks beat Miami 72-70 Friday
night to force a deciding Game 7 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were done. They were dead,'' Miami's Tim Hardaway said.
''I knew they were going to give it one last gasp in the second
half, and if we had make some shots and kept the lead up going into
the fourth, they would have folded. But you've got to give them
credit, they did the things they needed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an incredible comeback given the way the Heat dominated
for most of the game, but the Knicks -- like they did last year in
their improbable run to the finals -- found a way to thrive on
adversity and save their playoff lives.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing scored New York's final basket by dunking home an
offensive rebound with 1:56 left, and Chris Childs and Allan
Houston won it by each making a pair of free throws in the final 91
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Miami did not score over the final 2:20, and when Anthony
Carter's 3-point bomb missed at the buzzer, the Heat had blown a
golden opportunity to get past their biggest rival and move on to
the conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is what everybody wanted, a Game 7,'' Alonzo Mourning
said. ''Now you've got it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It was absolute madness,'' Heat coach Pat Riley said.
''Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks won the deciding games in 1998 and 1999 on Miami's
home court after losing there in 1997, and now they'll get a chance
to do it again.
</P>
<P>
   Houston rebounded from an invisible Game 5 to lead the Knicks
with 21 points, Latrell Sprewell added 15 and Ewing had 15 points
and 18 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a great, great comeback,'' Knicks coach Jeff Van
Gundy said. ''The only thing that makes it really memorable is if
it leads to a series win.''
</P>
<P>
   The teams tied the NBA record for fewest combined points in a
playoff game, matching the 142 by Atlanta and Detroit last season
and Phoenix and San Antonio this year. Miami's 25 points in the
second half were two better than the NBA record-low of 23 by Utah
at Chicago in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   After falling behind less than six minutes into the first
quarter, it took the Knicks more than 40 minutes to catch up and
tie the game. They finally did so on two free throws by Childs with
1:31 left that made it 70-70.
</P>
<P>
   Carter missed a jumper, Marcus Camby was rejected by Mourning
and Ewing then reached in to deflect an entry pass to Mourning,
leading to a steal by Childs. New York then called timeout with
23.6 seconds left on the game clock and 17 on the shot clock.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Majerle was called for a reach-in foul with 17.6 seconds
left and Houston calmly sank both shots, giving the Knicks their
first lead since 11-10.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat then got the ball to Mourning in the low post, but he
passed out of a double-team and found Carter for the final shot of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   When it missed, Madison Square Garden erupted in pandemonium --
as opposite a collective emotion as there could be from the way the
crowd felt at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ''The shot felt real good and I thought it was going in,''
Carter said, ''but I shot it a little too long.''
</P>
<P>
   The game started getting away from the Knicks early in the
second quarter after they closed to 21-20 by scoring the first four
points of the period.
</P>
<P>
   Jamal Mashburn made Sprewell look silly, spinning around him on
the perimeter and going in for an uncontested layup, and Carter
followed with a 23-foot jumper for an 8-0 run that made it 29-21.
</P>
<P>
   Missing layups, turning the ball over and too often getting only
one shot, the Knicks offensive futility would not subside as
Miami's confidence continued to grow.
</P>
<P>
   For every New York mistake, Miami found a way to capitalize. Two
turnovers by Sprewell in the period were both followed by Miami
points, and Sprewell also committed a flagrant foul on a breakaway
by Carter with 2:53 left. Carter made both, Bruce Bowen made a foul
shot and all of the sudden the Heat was up 43-25 and the Knicks
looked dead.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the liveliness that was missing in the first half
finally appeared at the start of the second half as the Knicks
erupted for 11 points in the first three minutes to close to 47-41.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've got you back on your heels,'' Riley screamed at his
team during a timeout as its 18-point lead was suddenly down to
six.
</P>
<P>
   New York got as close as five on four subsequent occasions but
couldn't get any closer until Sprewell made a free throw with 1:52
left in the period to make it 53-49, but Miami took a 58-53 lead
into the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks committed foul fouls in the first 1:51 of the fourth
and failed to score on their first four possessions, yet stayed in
it as Miami went 5{ minutes without a field goal after Carter's
corner jumper made it 60-53 with 11:21 left.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning hit two free throws with 7:30 left but then missed a
pair a minute later, and a short jumper by Houston made it 62-58
with 6:18 left. The teams traded baskets until Majerle missed on a
drive and Ewing hit a 15-footer to make it 66-64 with 3:19 left.
</P>
<P>
   Carter and Houston traded baskets, Carter hit again from the
corner, Ewing dunked a miss by Childs, Mourning missed a jumper and
Childs finally tied it at 70-70 on two foul shots with 1:31 left.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seemed as the fourth quarter went along we just made bad
play after bad play,'' P.J. Brown said. ''It just kind of mounted,
and we couldn't come back from it.''
</P>
<P>
Notes: Brown fouled out with 1:31 left, finishing with no points
and five rebounds in his worst game of the series. ... Mourning led
Miami with 22 and Carter had 15. ... The Eastern Conference finals
will begin Tuesday at Indiana, with only one day off between games
throughout the series.

New Taiwan President Takes Office
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwan's new president urged both sides of China to
discuss longstanding disputes and seek peace during his inaugural speech
Saturday. Speaking outside the red brick presidential palace, President Chen
Shui-bian said, ''The Cold War has ended. Now is the time to drop confrontations
and hostilities.'' Chen's 50-minute speech had been billed as one of his best
opportunities to relieve building pressure to forge a diplomatic breakthrough
with the island's giant communist neighbor, which has repeatedly threatened to
attack.

Rudy Giuliani Out of Senate Race
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Saying he agonized over the decision for days, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani dropped out of the Senate race Friday, abruptly halting an emerging
campaign against first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. Battling prostate cancer and
with his marriage in turmoil, Giuliani said it wasn't the right time for him to
run for office. Giuliani's departure from the race propels Rep. Rick Lazio, a
relatively unknown Long Island congressman, to the top of a list of Republicans
hoping to replace him in the battle for the Senate seat.

Philly Pier Debris Probed for Clues
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Investigators looked for clues today as they removed
wooden planks and plastic chairs from the Delaware river after a nightclub pier
collapsed yesterday, sending dozens of people into the water and killing three
people. Mayor John Street ordered an inspection of all piers on the river, many
of which support nightclubs and are believed to be 100 years old. The former
industrial area along the river is dotted with restaurants and other nightspots
catering to a college-age crowd. City clean-up crews removed most of the debris
floating in the river and stabilized the wrecked pier late today, so authorities
can begin a full-scale investigation Saturday morning, said Stephanie
Franklin-Suber, the mayor's chief of staff.

Blair's Wife Gives Birth
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The wife of British Prime Minister Tony Blair gave birth to a
baby boy early Saturday morning -- the couple's fourth child, officials said.
Cherie Blair, 45, and the baby were in good health, officials at Blair's Downing
Street office said. Mrs. Blair had been due to give birth on May 24, but was
admitted to Chelsea and Westminster hospital in west London at midday Friday.
The boy, whose name was not immediately disclosed, becomes the first child born
to a serving British prime minister in 152 years.

Nicaraguan Gunmen Kill Family of 11
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- Gunmen firing assault rifles killed 11 adult
members of a single family in Nicaragua and then burned their home, police said
Friday. The attack on Thursday near the town of Siuna, about 200 miles northeast
of Managua, came a day after three soldiers were killed in an ambush in the same
general area, the police said. The lone survivor of the attack, Guadalupe
Montenegro, was once a member of a group of former Sandinista soldiers suspected
of numerous attacks in the area, national police said. The dead, some of whom
were badly burned, included seven women and four men.

NRA May Open Times Square Store
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP)-- The sports-themed restaurants in Times Square might be
getting a new neighbor -- the National Rifle Association. NRASports Blast will
offer virtual-reality trap and skeet shooting, outdoor clothing and hunting
accessories. It will also feature a restaurant -- The N.R.A. Grille-- which will
serve wild game. But it won't sell guns. If NRASports Blast opens -- officials
said no lease has been signed and he did not know when the store would open --
it will pit itself against a slew of theme restaurants and stores in the Time
Square area. Besides ESPNZone, there's also Disney store, the All-Star Cafe and
the WWF store and restaurant.

Knicks Beat Heat 72-70
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Just when it looked like the New York Knicks were dead, they
reached deep down and summoned a dramatic comeback from an 18-point deficit to
send their series against Miami to a winner-take-all finale for the fourth
straight year. Overcoming Miami's relentless defense and their own self-doubts
after a miserable first half, the Knicks rallied past Miami 72-70 tonight to
force a deciding Game 7 on Sunday. It was an incredible comeback given the way
the Heat dominated for most of the game, but the Knicks -- like they did last
year in their improbable run to the finals -- found a way to thrive on adversity
and save their playoff lives.

<HEADLINE> Taiwanese President Takes Office  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM FOREMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwan's new president tried to defuse
dangerously tense relations with China in his inaugural speech
Saturday, urging the neighboring communist giant to discuss
long-standing disputes and seek peace.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking outside the red brick presidential palace, President
Chen Shui-bian told an audience of thousands, ''The Cold War has
ended. It is time for the two sides to cast aside the hostilities
left from the old era.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen's 50-minute speech had been billed as one of his best
opportunities to relieve building pressure to forge a diplomatic
breakthrough with China, which has repeatedly threatened to attack.
</P>
<P>
   Since a civil war split the two sides 51 years ago, China has
wanted the island 80 miles off its southeast coast to reunify with
the mainland. Seeking independence is grounds for a war, Beijing
has warned repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Chen repeated his pledge not to seek independence
as long as China does not attack: ''As long as communist China has
no intention to use force, I assure within my term of office I will
not declare independence.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen's address did not include the words Chinese leaders have
been wanting to hear: that Taiwan is an inseparable part of one
China. He has refused to accept Beijing's so-called ''one China
principle,'' fearing that agreeing to it would entail recognizing
that the communist government is the ruler of that one China.
</P>
<P>
   Becoming part of an impoverished China ruled by an authoritarian
regime has never appealed to the Taiwanese, who have built a
democracy with a thriving economy on an island about the size of
Massachusetts and Connecticut combined.
</P>
<P>
   But several times during his speech, Chen referred to the shared
ancestry of Taiwanese and Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people across the Taiwan Strait share the same ancestral,
cultural and historical background,'' said Chen, whose ancestors
came from China.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has long been sympathetic to Taiwan's concerns and
has been one of the few nations to sell defensive weapons to the
island. The United States is also Taiwan's most likely defender if
war breaks out, and U.S. Navy ships have cruised to the Taiwan
Strait in times of crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's inauguration marked the first time in China's 5,000 years
of history that a democratically elected opposition leader was
sworn in as the leader of a Chinese state.
</P>
<P>
   In his raspy voice, Chen faced the red, blue and white flag of
the Republic of China -- Taiwan's official name -- and took the oath
of office in the presidential palace. He promised that he will
''safeguard the security of the state and will no way betray the
people's trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen, who at 49 is Taiwan's youngest president, is a former
maritime lawyer who got involved in politics by defending democracy
activists arrested during the island's repressive martial law era,
which ended in 1987 and gave way to a robust democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The former Taipei mayor's stunning upset in the March 18
presidential election ended the Nationalist Party's
five-decade-long control of Taiwan's presidency. He replaces
retiring President Lee Teng-hui, Taiwan's first popularly elected
leader.
</P>
<P>
   Since Chen's election upset, Beijing's leaders have allowed him
a honeymoon of sorts, saying they will closely watch his words and
actions for a while.
</P>
<P>
   China is deeply suspicious of Chen because he was once an
outspoken supporter of independence. His Democratic Progressive
Party still favors letting voters decide if the island should break
away for good.
</P>
<P>
   However, Chen has recently softened his position, saying such a
referendum should only be held if China attacks. His campaign
opponents said this was a ploy to win votes from most Taiwanese,
who don't want reunification now but also oppose independence
because it might bring war.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Chen has worked hard to build up good will with Beijing.
He's offered to hold a peace summit and discuss Beijing's
''one-China principle.'' He has also said he would consider forming
a loose confederation with China.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Chen said, ''War is a failure of humanity. It is
the greatest harm to freedom, democracy and human rights.''

<HEADLINE> AIDS Vaccine To Be Tested in Uganda  </HEADLINE>
By ALEX DOMINGUEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- An oral AIDS vaccine is expected to undergo
human tests in Uganda in as little as 18 months, and could provide
an inexpensive form of prevention in poor countries hit hard by the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine, which could cost $1 per dose or less, is being
developed by the institute headed by Dr. Robert Gallo, one of the
co-discoverers of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Uganda health officials said Friday that the vaccine is the only
hope against the AIDS pandemic that affects millions in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't feel this announcement is the answer to AIDS, but it's
a very important additional step toward the next line of HIV
prevention candidates,'' said Gallo, who heads the University of
Maryland's Institute of Human Virology.
</P>
<P>
   The oral vaccine, which uses the common salmonella bacteria,
could be a cheap and easy means of preventing the deadly disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has the potential to be as cheap as any vaccine,'' said
Seth Berkley, president of the International AIDS Vaccine
Initiative, a non-profit which is providing at least $3 million
over three years to complete development of the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of several vaccines expected to be tested in Uganda,
according to Gallo's institute and the International AIDS Vaccine
Initiative
</P>
<P>
   Once in full production, the salmonella bacteria used to make
the vaccine could be grown in mass quantities, Berkley said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has the potential to be as cheap as any vaccine,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 70 percent of the world's 33.6 million HIV-infected
people live in sub-Saharan Africa. Current efforts to slow the
spread of the virus by eliminating risky behavior are not enough
because many people do not know they are infected, said Francis
Omaswa, Uganda's director general of health services.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even with an 80 percent cut in the prices of drugs, they will
still be too expensive for our people'' Omaswa said. ''That brings
us back again to a vaccine. It is for this reason, that we have
associated ourselves with this initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   The strain of salmonella bacteria responsible for typhoid is
genetically altered to be less infectious and to carry portions of
the DNA of the HIV virus, which causes AIDS, into the body.
</P>
<P>
   Once the salmonella bacteria invade intestinal cells, the
bacteria die, their cells break apart and the HIV DNA they carry is
released.
</P>
<P>
   The infected intestinal cells are then hijacked by the HIV and
produce a part of the HIV virus, which is not harmful but causes an
immune response. Researchers hope that will allow the body to fight
off an attack by the real HIV virus.
</P>
<P>
   More than two dozen potential AIDS vaccines have been tried
worldwide. Only one, however, has advanced to large-scale testing,
the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   Results of trials of that vaccine, produced by Vaxgen, should be
available in late 2002 or early 2003, said Dr. Peggy Johnston,
assistant director for AIDS vaccines at the National Institutes of
Allergy and Infections Diseases, a part of the National Institutes
of Health.

<HEADLINE> NRA Members Shun Smith &AMP; Wesson  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NOWELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- A week after the Million Mom March
anti-gun demonstration in Washington, gun advocates planned their
own rally during this weekend's annual meeting of the National
Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is going to be a celebration of the Second Amendment,''
NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre promised Friday, the
opening day of the group's 129th annual convention.
</P>
<P>
   Today's march was scheduled prior to an address by NRA President
Charlton Heston, who is expected to be re-elected to a third term
when the convention concludes Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will be the most important meetings in our history,''
Heston said in a taped message played Friday. ''We are about to
have the most important election in this organization's history.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our gun rights are truly in peril. When the sun comes up on
Nov. 8, who wins the election will determine our freedoms into the
next century.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people on Friday milled around the hundreds of
exhibits by gun-makers, hunter associations and collectors in the
Charlotte Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   Smith &AMP; Wesson, the nation's largest gunmaker, got a mixed
reception, with some people shunning its exhibit because it agreed
to put childproof locks on its pistols.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's important for the people of this country to stand
by their Second Amendment rights,'' said Diane Peroutka, attending
the convention with her three children. She said she would avoid
the Smith &AMP; Wesson exhibit, where more than 100 handguns were
displayed.
</P>
<P>
   Others said that while they disagreed with Smith &AMP; Wesson's
action, they still would buy their guns.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Smith &AMP; Wesson announced it would install
locks on all the firearms it sells to safeguard them from children,
introduce ''smart gun'' technology within three years and prohibit
the sale of its weapons at gun shows without a background check.
</P>
<P>
   NRA leaders and other gunmakers sharply criticized Smith &AMP;
Wesson for jeopardizing gun owners' Second Amendment rights, but
said the company still was welcome at its convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some manufacturers aren't happy,'' said Ken Jorgenson, a
spokesman for the Springfield, Mass. gunmaker. ''But we're still
talking. We're a small industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith &AMP; Wesson also will be the preferred gun retailer for law
enforcement officials in 190 communities that have joined the
Communities for Safer Guns Coalition. Seven other gun-makers and an
industry group have challenged that arrangement in a federal
lawsuit in Atlanta alleging an illegal conspiracy to retrain trade.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, LaPierre described the group's plan to open a
megastore in New York City's Times Square containing retail space,
a restaurant and virtual shooting ranges.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, NRA opponents launched a slate of vigils and marches
with a news conference at which Michael Barnes, president of
Handgun Control and the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence in
Washington, D.C., pledged to ''remind the public of the NRA's
hypocrisy when it comes to preventing gun violence.''

<HEADLINE> Pastor's Return May Not Be Long  </HEADLINE>
By MARTHA IRVINE
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A sign outside Broadway United Methodist Church
carries the message of this Sunday's sermon: ''Always Forgive Your
Enemies. Nothing Annoys Them More.''
</P>
<P>
   One week after United Methodists solidified their ban on
same-sex weddings, the quote attributed to gay Irish playwright
Oscar Wilde also could apply to both sides in a divided church.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Gregory Dell, a pastor suspended for marrying a gay
couple at the church in 1998, has a feeling the rift is unlikely to
go away. For the first time since his church trial more than a year
ago, he says a split from the United Methodist Church may be
unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   ''The possibility of schism -- that is, a separate denomination --
is one that we have wanted to avoid if there's any way we could
avoid it,'' the 54-year-old pastor said in an interview with The
Associated Press. ''But that's certainly something that will be
under consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell is set to preach again at Broadway, where about a third of
the members are gay, on July 2. But he wonders how long he'll be
there since he still believes it is his pastoral duty to marry
church members -- gay or straight.
</P>
<P>
   But he says it's not as a protest.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't be concerned about sending a message to the United
Methodist Church,'' Dell said. ''What I am concerned about is the
people.
</P>
<P>
   ''For folks to believe that they no longer have an option in a
mainstream Protestant church ... that would be tragic.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell was among 29 people arrested -- many of them for the second
time -- during the United Methodist general conference last week in
Cleveland. Bishop C. Joseph Sprague of Chicago and Bishop Susan
Morrison of Schenectady, N.Y., also were among those arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Sprague and Dell both argued that the church should accept gay
marriage, just as it has decided to allow women to be ordained as
pastors and for divorced people to marry in the church.
</P>
<P>
   But about 60 percent of those voting at the conference -- pastors
and lay leaders from all over the country -- made it clear that the
issue was not negotiable.
</P>
<P>
   ''I applaud it. I think the church has upheld its position that
has been a part of church teaching for at least 2,000 years,'' said
the Rev. Stephen C. Williams, a pastor in suburban Lombard who
served as prosecutor in Dell's church trial last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The church cannot duck moral and spiritual issues. I think the
church has the fundamental right to define itself.''
</P>
<P>
   While he believes there will be a need to get over bad feelings
from the conference, the Rev. Scott Field, a Naperville pastor who
is a leader in a conservative Methodist movement called Good News,
said ''the church is getting ready to move on to other issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrests in Cleveland marked the first time anyone was
physically removed from a United Methodist general conference, a
meeting that is held every four years.
</P>
<P>
   Dell said he was stunned at an atmosphere of
''mean-spiritedness'' at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the course of the disagreement ... there was always a
willingness for people to hold together, even with those with whom
they strongly disagreed,'' Dell said. ''And that disappeared at
this general conference.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he still believes Dell is misguided on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have great respect for Greg Dell,'' Williams said. ''But I
think on this issue he is tragically and terribly wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his opposition, Sprague is calling for his flock of
Northern Illinois pastors to obey the church's decision.
</P>
<P>
   But Dell remains steadfast.
</P>
<P>
   ''It feels to me clear that the United Methodist Church is not
where God is on this issue -- and it's not even where society is,''
Dell said. ''God's not going to leave this alone. I still believe
that.''

<HEADLINE> Haiti pPrepares For Elections  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE FAUL
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Under pressure from Washington and
the United Nations, Haiti at long last will try to hold elections
Sunday that are essential to restoring a legal government and vital
foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   Disgusted with their politicians and despairing of a seemingly
endless impoverishment, Haitians are eager to cast their ballots:
More than half the population of 8 million is registered to vote.
</P>
<P>
   But a flare-up of political violence, government foot-dragging
and the bumbling preparations of Haiti's elections council could
mean trouble for the legislative and local elections, Haiti's first
vote since a disputed 1997 ballot. Voters' enthusiasm has been
doused by fear, opposition candidates have stopped campaigning and
the United States and United Nations -- which intervened to restore
democracy in 1994 and stop an exodus of Haitian boat people -- worry
their Haitian experiment is unraveling.
</P>
<P>
   ''By turning out to register in large numbers, Haitians have
demonstrated their commitment to constitutionality and to the
democratic process,'' U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in a
statement urging Haitians ''to forsake violence and to ensure that
voters may exercise their constitutional right to vote without
intimidation.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's turnout will show whether Haitians are listening -- or
will give in to fear.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people have said, 'Don't go out Sunday, there's going
to be trouble at the polls,''' said Lucien Pierre, a 37-year-old
schoolteacher. ''So I'm not going to go out.''
</P>
<P>
   Marnitte Jean, a mason, disagreed: ''Not to vote is to throw in
the towel.''
</P>
<P>
   The locus is former president Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the former
slum priest and president who, as Haiti's most popular politician,
is the central figure of recent Haitian history.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition parties say the elections are being rigged to favor
his Lavalas Family party and set up a dictatorship under Aristide,
who few doubt will win presidential elections planned for November.
</P>
<P>
   Aristide lent his inspiration to a popular uprising that forced
the 29-year Duvalier dictatorship from power in 1986. The military
aborted Haiti's first free elections in 1987, killing voters at
polling stations. Undaunted, millions turned out in 1990 to elect
Aristide.
</P>
<P>
   Overthrown in a 1991 coup, Aristide was restored to power after
the 1994 invasion ousted a bloody army-backed regime -- but was
barred by law from seeking a consecutive term. He picked Rene
Preval to succeed him in 1995 elections and created Lavalas. Preval
oversaw a fraud-ridden 1997 legislative vote and created an
unconstitutional government by disbanding Parliament in 1999 and
appointing a new premier by decree.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's elections -- postponed at least four times since 1998 --
give Haitians a chance to right things and, in the process, free
$500 million in desperately needed foreign aid that is on hold
until their country is legally governed.
</P>
<P>
   The vote also is a test of Aristide's ability to stock
Parliament and thousands of local government offices with Lavalas
loyalists.
</P>
<P>
   A once-ambitious opposition movement wants to prevent that -- but
has become increasingly demoralized as the election nears.
</P>
<P>
   The repeated delays, Preval's endorsement of Lavalas candidates
despite a requirement he be apolitical, attacks on opposition
offices by Aristide supporters and political violence that has
killed 15 people -- mostly opposition officials -- have forced most
non-Lavalas figures to quit their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti's U.N.-trained police force has been unable -- or unwilling
-- to stop the violence. Not one suspect has been arrested in any of
the attacks, and officers stood and watched as Aristide supporters
set an opposition party office ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   ''Short of a miracle, I don't see how we can have credible
elections,'' opposition politician Evans Paul said after a grenade
exploded Thursday at the gate to the electoral council office,
injuring seven passers-by. The attack, he said, aimed ''to
intimidate the independent voter into staying at home, leaving the
field wide open for Aristide partisans.''
</P>
<P>
   Lavalas Family spokesmen routinely deny the party is behind the
violence.
</P>
<P>
   From afar, aid donors, the United States and the United Nations
-- which have invested more than $1 billion in Haiti since the 1994
intervention -- are keeping their fingers crossed. A good sign is
that while less than 5 percent of a disillusioned electorate turned
out to elect Preval, 93 percent of eligible Haitians are registered
to vote Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite all the difficulties observed, credible legislative,
municipal and local elections are still possible,'' the
Organization of American States said Friday.

<HEADLINE> Military Surrounds Fiji Parliament  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Heavily armed troops surrounded the parliament
building in this South Pacific paradise Saturday, where insurgents
claiming they were ruling the country held government leaders
hostage.
</P>
<P>
   Radio Fiji reported the gunmen led by Suva businessman George
Speight have threatened to shoot their hostages if attacked, and
local reporters inside parliament said the rebels appeared
increasingly nervous in anticipation of a military rescue.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the hostages, Deputy Prime Minister Tupeni Baba,
appealed to the government in a statement not to attempt such a
raid, saying ''if shooting takes place, we must expect the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   Radio Fiji, which has a reporter inside parliament, later
reported the rebels had held a gun to Prime Minister Mahendra
Chaudhry's head and threatened to execute him. Chaudhry also
reportedly was badly beaten by his captors.
</P>
<P>
   The developments came as authorities resumed direct talks with
the seven masked gunmen who stormed parliament a day earlier,
firing from AK-47 rifles before seizing Baba, Chaudhry, Cabinet
ministers and lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhry is Fiji's first ethnic Indian prime minister. His
year-old administration is the first to be dominated by
Indo-Fijians, a fact that has angered some indigenous people in
this island group located two-thirds of the way from Hawaii to New
Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   Speight said he had seized power on behalf of all ethnic Fijians
and was suspending the constitution. On Saturday, he announced that
he had been sworn in as interim prime minister and would rule Fiji
by decree.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is obvious to everybody that the actions that we have taken
are per the desire and fulfillment of the aspirations of our
indigenous people,'' Speight told a news conference Saturday inside
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   But it is clear he has neither control nor influence outside the
parliament building.
</P>
<P>
   And the coup attempt appeared headed for failure as military,
police and influential Fijian leaders lined up behind Chaudhry's
democratically elected government and President Ratu Sir Kamisese
Mara.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's seizure of parliament coincided with a march through
Suva of supporters of the nationalist Taukei Movement, which
erupted into hours of rioting when news of the hostage taking
broke. Markets in downtown Suva were torched, store windows
shattered and shops looted.
</P>
<P>
   Ratu Mara declared a state of emergency, giving himself the
power to command the military. He imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew and
appealed to the hostage takers to release the lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Police said 200 rioters were arrested. Peace had returned to
Suva's streets before daybreak Saturday, although some looting was
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The Taukei Movement on Saturday called on Fijians to march to
parliament in a show of support for Speight. By mid-afternoon,
about two dozen people who had gathered before the movement's call
was issued were the only visible supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Former prime minister Sitiveni Rabuka -- himself leader of two
coups in 1987 -- was holding direct talks with the rebels, saying he
had urged them to surrender.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am totally behind the president in this case,'' Rabuka said.
</P>
<P>
   Rabuka, who is also chairman of the council of chiefs -- the
supreme body for ethnic Fijians -- said he would call on the council
to express their support for Chaudhry and to expressly deny
Speight's claim that he is acting on behalf of ethnic Fijians.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Jahir Kahn, assistant commissioner for the
police-military operation guarding the streets, said the rebels had
no support among the military.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can say it's a coup or you can say it's a situation,''
Kahn said. ''But right now as far as we're concerned (Mara) is
still our president. He's declared a state of emergency and we are
working directly for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhry's election came under a revamped constitution which
largely removed clauses that discriminated against Indian migrants,
originally brought to Fiji as laborers on sugar plantations.
</P>
<P>
   Sun-drenched Fiji is one of the most developed of the Pacific
island economies, heavily reliant on tourism and sugar exports. The
former British colony is considered an easygoing nation but tension
has been building for months between minority ethnic Indians, who
make up about 44 percent of the 813,000 people, and the majority
Fijians, who account for 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji nationalists are angry at attempts by Chaudhry to persuade
Fijian landowners to renew expiring leases on farm land held by
thousands of ethnic Indian tenants.
</P>
<P>
   In a nationally broadcast radio address Friday, Ratu Mara
appealed for calm.
</P>
<P>
   ''In these difficult times and on these occasions, a lot of
courage is demanded of us all,'' said Ratu Mara, whose daughter,
Adi Koila Mara, was among ministers being held.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, Australia and New Zealand called for the
release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   ''The consequences of any unconstitutional seizure of power
would be very substantial,'' the U.S. Embassy in Suva said.
American Ambassador Osman Siddique met with Ratu Mara Rabuka to
discuss the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Commonwealth Secretary-General Don McKinnon on Saturday warned
that Fiji could be expelled from the multination grouping if
Speight came to power.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm concerned and very angry ... I wouldn't like to see a
situation again where Fiji isolates itself from the international
community,'' McKinnon told Fiji Radio.

<HEADLINE> Cliton Scraps TV Pitch For China  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Advised by congressional Democrats that the
effort could be counterproductive, President Clinton abandoned
plans to make a nationally televised speech to pitch legislation
establishing permanent normal trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   During a political fund-raising trip to Philadelphia and Chicago
on Friday, Clinton abruptly canceled a five-minute, televised Oval
Office address on behalf of the trade bill that he had scheduled
for Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   His decision followed talks with House Minority Leader Dick
Gephardt, D-Mo., and other congressional Democrats while on the
flight to Chicago, White House spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been talking with them for the past couple of days about
what's the most productive way to get votes on this,'' Palmieri
said. ''They've advised us that they don't think that the Oval
Office address is the most productive way to get votes.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would open China's markets to more U.S. goods, and end
20 years of annual reviews of China's trade status. The bill is
supported by the business community and opposed by labor,
environmental and some veterans' groups. Both sides said the vote
remains close and predicted a weekend of hard lobbying.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats had asked Gephardt, an opponent of the
legislation, to deliver a televised response to Clinton's address.
A senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said some other lawmakers who had urged Clinton to make the speech
changed their minds Friday, feeling the address would raise the
stakes for the legislation and ''make it more divisive and
high-profile than it needed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC and CBS had said they would not carry Clinton's speech. ABC
said the network had already covered both sides of the issue on its
news programs, and CBS said the address amounted to lobbying. NBC,
CNN and Fox had said they would carry it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., and other supporters of
the trade deal claimed new momentum, citing both a new
China-European Union trade agreement and a side plan backed by the
bipartisan congressional leadership for a watchdog commission to
monitor human rights in China.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will be able to have the votes necessary for a strong
victory,'' said Dreier, chairman of the House Rules Committee. He
said his panel, which sets ground rules for considering bills, will
meet Tuesday, followed by House floor debate on the measure
Wednesday and a vote either late that day or Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Five formerly undecided House members -- Democrats John LaFalce
of New York, Thomas Sawyer of Ohio and Diana DeGette of Colorado;
and Republican Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas -- announced their support
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Closing the door on China will not improve human rights in
China. It would be a step back,'' DeGette said.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents claimed three new converts to the ''no'' column: Reps.
Robert Andrews, D-N.J.; Rod R. Blagojevich, D-Ill.; and Karen
McCarthy, D-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bills are H.R. 4444 and S. 2277

<HEADLINE> Haiti Prepares For Elections  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE FAUL
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Under pressure from Washington and
the United Nations, Haiti at long last will try to hold elections
Sunday that are essential to restoring a legal government and vital
foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   Disgusted with their politicians and despairing of a seemingly
endless impoverishment, Haitians are eager to cast their ballots:
More than half the population of 8 million is registered to vote.
</P>
<P>
   But a flare-up of political violence, government foot-dragging
and the bumbling preparations of Haiti's elections council could
mean trouble for the legislative and local elections, Haiti's first
vote since a disputed 1997 ballot. Voters' enthusiasm has been
doused by fear, opposition candidates have stopped campaigning and
the United States and United Nations -- which intervened to restore
democracy in 1994 and stop an exodus of Haitian boat people -- worry
their Haitian experiment is unraveling.
</P>
<P>
   ''By turning out to register in large numbers, Haitians have
demonstrated their commitment to constitutionality and to the
democratic process,'' U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in a
statement urging Haitians ''to forsake violence and to ensure that
voters may exercise their constitutional right to vote without
intimidation.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's turnout will show whether Haitians are listening -- or
will give in to fear.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people have said, 'Don't go out Sunday, there's going
to be trouble at the polls,''' said Lucien Pierre, a 37-year-old
schoolteacher. ''So I'm not going to go out.''
</P>
<P>
   Marnitte Jean, a mason, disagreed: ''Not to vote is to throw in
the towel.''
</P>
<P>
   The locus is former president Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the former
slum priest and president who, as Haiti's most popular politician,
is the central figure of recent Haitian history.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition parties say the elections are being rigged to favor
his Lavalas Family party and set up a dictatorship under Aristide,
who few doubt will win presidential elections planned for November.
</P>
<P>
   Aristide lent his inspiration to a popular uprising that forced
the 29-year Duvalier dictatorship from power in 1986. The military
aborted Haiti's first free elections in 1987, killing voters at
polling stations. Undaunted, millions turned out in 1990 to elect
Aristide.
</P>
<P>
   Overthrown in a 1991 coup, Aristide was restored to power after
the 1994 invasion ousted a bloody army-backed regime -- but was
barred by law from seeking a consecutive term. He picked Rene
Preval to succeed him in 1995 elections and created Lavalas. Preval
oversaw a fraud-ridden 1997 legislative vote and created an
unconstitutional government by disbanding Parliament in 1999 and
appointing a new premier by decree.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's elections -- postponed at least four times since 1998 --
give Haitians a chance to right things and, in the process, free
$500 million in desperately needed foreign aid that is on hold
until their country is legally governed.
</P>
<P>
   The vote also is a test of Aristide's ability to stock
Parliament and thousands of local government offices with Lavalas
loyalists.
</P>
<P>
   A once-ambitious opposition movement wants to prevent that -- but
has become increasingly demoralized as the election nears.
</P>
<P>
   The repeated delays, Preval's endorsement of Lavalas candidates
despite a requirement he be apolitical, attacks on opposition
offices by Aristide supporters and political violence that has
killed 15 people -- mostly opposition officials -- have forced most
non-Lavalas figures to quit their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti's U.N.-trained police force has been unable -- or unwilling
-- to stop the violence. Not one suspect has been arrested in any of
the attacks, and officers stood and watched as Aristide supporters
set an opposition party office ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   ''Short of a miracle, I don't see how we can have credible
elections,'' opposition politician Evans Paul said after a grenade
exploded Thursday at the gate to the electoral council office,
injuring seven passers-by. The attack, he said, aimed ''to
intimidate the independent voter into staying at home, leaving the
field wide open for Aristide partisans.''
</P>
<P>
   Lavalas Family spokesmen routinely deny the party is behind the
violence.
</P>
<P>
   From afar, aid donors, the United States and the United Nations
-- which have invested more than $1 billion in Haiti since the 1994
intervention -- are keeping their fingers crossed. A good sign is
that while less than 5 percent of a disillusioned electorate turned
out to elect Preval, 93 percent of eligible Haitians are registered
to vote Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite all the difficulties observed, credible legislative,
municipal and local elections are still possible,'' the
Organization of American States said Friday.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Pirates Plunder Ships  </HEADLINE>
By SLOBODAN LEKIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOLOP ISLAND, Indonesia (AP) -- A Colt .45 strapped to his hip,
Sgt. Marwando gazes out at the shimmering sea from a clump of palm
trees, standing guard on the front line of the international war
against piracy.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles to the north, the Singapore skyline adorns the
horizon. Between the affluent city-state and this tiny Indonesian
island inhabited only by a handful of navy frogmen, lies the
world's most congested -- and potentially dangerous -- shipping lane.
</P>
<P>
   The narrow straits of Malacca and Singapore are the most
pirate-infested waterways of the world. Despite the vigilance of
Marwando and his fellow lookouts, the buccaneers have exacted an
increasingly heavy toll on international shipping.
</P>
<P>
   When Philippine rebels on boats recently took 21 hostages from a
resort island in Malaysia, the world's attention was again focused
on this centuries-old problem.
</P>
<P>
   Experts warn that major collisions and ecological disasters
could occur, because the pirates have taken to shackling crews on
their oil tankers and setting the vessels adrift.
</P>
<P>
   In the most extreme cases, crime syndicates employ hardened
criminals who sometimes execute entire crews. The vessels are then
renamed, and their cargos sold at distant foreign anchorages where
corrupt officials can be bribed to look the other way.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate to stem the brazen attacks on its side of the narrows,
Indonesia's ill-equipped navy has appealed for foreign donations of
high-tech equipment such as naval radars and computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need night-vision equipment with video cameras to film the
bandits, more speedboats for our frogmen, global positioning
systems, that sort of thing,'' said Col. Boedi Setyadi, commander
of the Batam naval base that controls the Indonesian side of the
straits.
</P>
<P>
   But efforts to modernize the service have been crippled by the
United States, Indonesia's traditional source of weaponry, which
imposed a ban last year on military exports following the
destruction of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   According to the London-based International Maritime Bureau's
latest survey, 19 pirate attacks were recorded in Indonesia in the
first three months of this year, compared to 18 cases during the
same period in 1999 and 10 in 1998. That means the waterway
accounts for one-third of all maritime attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, more than 50,000 ships ply the straits, which link
Europe and Asia. An armada of tankers, container ships, liquefied
natural gas carriers and other merchant vessels tail one another in
short intervals as they traverse the five-mile-wide stretch of
water opposite Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   The pirates lurk in the countless inlets and mangrove swamps
that dot the coastline of Sumatra or among the hundreds of islets
and reefs near Singapore. Their speedboats quickly slither in and
out of the sea lanes under cover of darkness to plunder and then
run for cover.
</P>
<P>
   Pulling up alongside ships, modern swashbucklers use grappling
hooks to hoist themselves onto the vulnerable, heavily laden
vessels. They usually surprise and overwhelm the crews, who are
warned against trying to repel the invaders by force.
</P>
<P>
   Shipping insurers and governments have called for coordinated
action to halt the terror and make the crowded waterway safe for
seafarers. As a result, officials from 16 Asian countries agreed
last month during a Tokyo conference to develop strategies for
fighting piracy in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ''Only government action can eradicate attacks in this area,''
said Neil Choong, a spokesman for the International Maritime
Bureau's regional office in Malaysia. ''As long as there is a
significant naval presence, the number of incidents will be
reduced.''
</P>
<P>
   The robberies also frequently go unreported by the victims,
because police investigations entail lengthy delays for ships whose
operating costs can reach $10,000 per day.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Indonesia's navy chief of staff, Adm. Achmad
Sutjipto, said his service would need to more than double its 114
vessels, many dating back to the 1940s, and 53 aircraft to deploy
effective patrols.
</P>
<P>
   Sutjipto also wants to create a coast guard that would focus on
piracy and smuggling among Indonesia's 17,508 islands.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, warships and maritime reconnaissance aircraft from
Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia have begun joint patrols of the
seaway.
</P>
<P>
   But without night-vision goggles, video cameras and other
surveillance equipment, it's still impossible to effectively
monitor the situation, said Marwando.
</P>
<P>
   ''At night, bandits could attack a ship 500 yards away and we
would know nothing about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even when they put out to sea in their inflatable boats --
usually after being alerted by passing fishermen -- the frogmen find
it difficult to arrest pirates.
</P>
<P>
   ''They just throw their weapons overboard and pretend they are
fishing,'' said Marwando. ''We can detain them, but we cannot prove
anything.''

<HEADLINE> Foreign Efforts Fail In Zimbabwe  </HEADLINE>
By RAVI NESSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Three African presidents met with
President Robert Mugabe and publicly praised him as a defender of
the rule of law -- while behind closed doors they demanded he end
political violence and hold free and fair elections.
</P>
<P>
   But the tactic used last month -- similar to one used this week
by Commonwealth Secretary-General Don McKinnon -- has failed to
lessen the violence and the intimidation of the political
opposition. Instead, attacks have increased, and many now believe
it's time for the international community to get tough.
</P>
<P>
   Since the African leaders' April 21 summit, at least 14
opposition supporters have been killed and black squatters
supported by ruling party officials have occupied more white-owned
farms.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing has changed,'' said Lovemore Madsuku, vice chairman of
the National Constitutional Assembly, an alliance of civic groups.
''What you need is a clear message to the public that the
international community does not accept this sort of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The violence began in February after Mugabe lost a
constitutional referendum that would have entrenched his powers and
given him the right to seize white-owned farms for redistribution
to landless blacks without paying compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Armed squatters and ruling party militants began occupying white
farms, seen as havens of opposition support, and attacking
opposition supporters. At least 21 people, mainly opposition
activists, have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition parties and human rights groups accuse Mugabe of
orchestrating a campaign of terror to intimidate his opponents
before parliamentary elections called for June, in which the
Movement for Democratic Change party was expected to pose a stiff
challenge to the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   After the summit, South African President Thabo Mbeki,
Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano and Namibian President Sam
Nujoma praised Mugabe as a defender of the rule of law and
expressed faith in his efforts to end the violence.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki confirmed to foreign journalists last week that behind
closed doors he told Mugabe the violence must end, the farm
occupations must cease and free and fair elections must be held.
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon also treated Mugabe with kid gloves in his public
statements, in which he accepted Mugabe's renewed pledges to stop
the bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   ''He genuinely wants to see a lessening of the violence,''
McKinnon said Tuesday. He told reporters he had privately expressed
his concerns to Mugabe about the killings, reportedly taking a
strong tone.
</P>
<P>
   But hours later, an opposition supporter was killed and 18 other
people injured in political clashes in Harare.
</P>
<P>
   Critics call Mugabe's pledges insincere.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are making a very wrong assumption that when Mugabe
says violence must end, violence will end,'' said Morgan
Tsvangirai, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change. ''It has
not been working.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only has the international community's approach been
ineffective, it has disheartened many Zimbabweans looking for
public support and who now might be afraid to vote, said Munyaradzi
Bidi, national director of the human rights organization ZimRights.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders appeared more concerned with maintaining good
relations with Zimbabwe's government than with supporting democracy
and justice, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is sad that (foreign leaders) feel they must maintain the
rule of law and justice in their own countries,'' Bidi said, ''but
just across the border they do not condemn the violence.''

<HEADLINE> Handyman Convicted of Sex Murders  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- A handyman who sexually assaulted and
murdered four women has been sentenced to four life terms without
parole.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Gaynor, 33, on Friday was convicted of aggravated rape
and murder in the deaths in Springfield between November 1997 and
February 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Katherine Thomas, the mother of victim Jo Ann Thomas, 38, had
tears in her eyes after hearing the guilty verdicts.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just relieved that this is all over and he just won't hurt
any families,'' said Thomas, who is caring for her daughter's
children, ages 5 and 12. ''They don't know their mother and they
will always be haunted by that.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution said the killer lured the victims by offering
them cocaine, then sodomized them and choked them to death.
</P>
<P>
   The trial hinged largely on DNA tests that linked Gaynor to
semen and blood found on or near the bodies of four women.
</P>
<P>
   Gaynor, who was also an auto body repairman, continued to deny
his guilt after the verdicts, telling WGGB-TV of Springfield he was
innocent just before he was taken away in a van.

<HEADLINE> Mariners 7, Devil Rays 6  </HEADLINE>
By JIM COUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Rickey Henderson scored the tying run from first
base in his first game for Seattle, and the Mariners went on to
beat the Tampa Bay Devil Rays 7-6 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   With Seattle trailing 6-5 in the eighth inning, Henderson
entered as a pinch runner and scored on Stan Javier's double off
Billy Taylor (0-1), which went over center fielder Gerald Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Hernandez came in and walked pinch-hitter Tom Lampkin.
Mike Cameron sacrificed, and Mark McLemore's sacrifice put the
Mariners ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Mesa (2-2), who gave up a three-run homer to Greg Vaughn in
the seventh that gave Tampa Bay a 6-4 lead, got the victory.
Kazuhiro Sasaki pitched the ninth for his fifth save.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's Alex Rodriguez hit his 14th homer off Albie Lopez in
the bottom of the seventh to extend his hitting streak to 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, signed as a free agent by the Mariners on Wednesday
night after his release by the New York Mets, arrived at Safeco
Field about an hour before the game. He was activated, got a
uniform and received a standing ovation when he came in to pinch
run.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's Brett Tomko had to leave because of stiffness in his
right shoulder after he went to a 3-1 count on John Flaherty in the
fourth. The Mariners were uncertain of his status. Tomko was
acquired Feb. 10 in the trade that sent Ken Griffey Jr. to
Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners already have starters Jamie Moyer and Freddy Garcia
on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   With Seattle ahead 4-2, Jose Paniagua walked Kevin Stocker,
Miguel Cairo and Gerald Williams to load the bases in the seventh.
Vinny Castilla's sacrifice against Mesa drove in a run, and and
Vaughn drove Mesa's next pitch into the second deck in left field
for his second homer of the night and 12th of the season. Vaughn
also homered in the first.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's Edgar Martinez went 3-for-4 with his 12th homer of the
season and fourth of the week. In four games of a six-game
homestand, the designated hitter is 9-for-17 with 11 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Javier, starting in left field, also homered and McLemore had
three stolen bases for the third time in his career and first since
April 6, 1998, when he was with Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Williams homered in the fifth for Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez had an RBI single in the bottom of the first before
Javier homered to lead off the second. In the fourth, McLemore
singled in a run. Martinez homered to the opposite field in the
fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Gooden started for Tampa Bay and allowed four runs on 10
hits and three walks. Tomko pitched three innings plus, allowing
one run on four hits and two walks.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Seattle won its fourth in a row and Tampa Bay suffered its
sixth defeat in a row. ... Flaherty, Tampa Bay's catcher, threw out
Jay Buhner attempting to steal second in the fifth. Flaherty is
7-for-33 (.212) throwing out base runners attempting to steal this
season. ... Before the game, the Devil Rays called up RHP Taylor
from Triple-A Durham and sent RHP Jeff Sparks to their
International League farm club. Taylor became the 34th Devil Rays
player to play this season and the 17th pitcher. ... The Mariners
activated Henderson and sent RHP Kevin Hodges to Triple-A Tacoma.
... Vaughn came into the game in a 5-for-29 slump. He was 3-for-4
with two homers and four RBIs. He had his 27th career multi-homer
game and his third this season. Vaughn homered in his 35th major
league ballpark.

<HEADLINE> Tamil Rebels Seek Big Prize in War  </HEADLINE>
By NEELESH MISRA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Hungry for victory, columns of Tamil
rebels are knocking at the gates of an ancient city guarded by
40,000 tired and dispirited Sri Lankan soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Jaffna, a city inhabited by Tamils for centuries and a major
port for European colonialists since the 16th century, is the
biggest trophy in the South Asian island nation's 17-year civil
war. The separatist Tamil Tigers, who ran a virtual state from
Jaffna from 1990-95, are closer to retaking their former capital
that at any time in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   The city's loss by a sagging army would be a watershed in the
conflict, and could lead to electoral defeat this year for
President Chandrika Kumaratunga, who has promoted an autonomy plan
for Sri Lanka's 3.2 million minority Tamils.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a setback,'' said retired Gen. Dennis Perera, former
chief of the Sri Lankan army. Perera, however, said the city's fall
would not be a final defeat for the government.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels have closed in on the city, and in the past two days have
sowed fears among government forces by firing artillery at the
Palali air base and the Kankesanturai port area -- the only two
functional supply lines for 40,000 troops defending Jaffna. Until
now, the government considered these key bases impregnable.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the rebels warned Jaffna's 500,000 residents to flee
to safety.
</P>
<P>
   In the capital, Colombo, Kumaratunga called the offensive ''a
decisive moment in the war'' and encouraged her soldiers to ''wipe
out the (rebels) completely.''
</P>
<P>
   Capturing Jaffna would give the rebels a position of strength in
peace talks being sponsored by Norway. A Norwegian peace mission
was due in the Sri Lankan capital today.
</P>
<P>
   Military observers are trying to analyze how 5,000 rebel
fighters could beat back 40,000 Sri Lankan government soldiers
supported by jet bombers, artillery, helicopter gunships and a
navy.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is surprising is how a large force of Sri Lankan troops,
nearly twice the number required to defend and hold Jaffna, have
fared'' against the rebels, said retired Gen. Amarjit Singh Kalkat,
who led a 50,000-strong Indian peacekeeping force in Sri Lanka that
fought the Tamil Tigers in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ''Probably the only problem is that the army's morale has
collapsed,'' Kalkat told The Associated Press. ''There's poor
leadership, lack of training and lack of motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, the rebels have steadily advanced, capturing
hundreds of soldiers and demoralizing government forces.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a costly war for the army: Officials say that since
1983, 14,000 troops are dead, 6,000 wounded and an estimated 10,000
are missing in action. Over 60,000 lives have been lost in the war
since fighting began in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   According to several estimates, 10 to 15 percent of soldiers
leave the force each year. Heavy casualties are making the army an
unattractive career option for the nation's youth, even those from
poor families. Early this year the army advertised in newspapers
for young men to join its elite commando corps on a walk-in basis.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a lot of fatigue. ... Troops are fighting
continuously for months and years without end, without break or
recreation,'' Perera said in a telephone interview from Sri Lanka,
where the government has censored all news reporting on the war.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, who have a special wing of suicide bombers, seem
unaffected by losses. Human rights activists say thousands of
children, including girls as young as 10, are used as soldiers by
the rebels, and even under mortar fire they drag the bodies of
their dead from the battlefield. Their code name for the assault on
Jaffna is ''Operation Unceasing Waves.''
</P>
<P>
   Led by their elusive and feared leader, Vellupillai Prabhakaran,
they are seen by some as an efficient, tough, resource-rich outfit
that resembles an army more than a militant group. Kalkat described
the Tamil Tigers as the ''deadliest militant organization in the
world.''

<HEADLINE> Fusaichi Pegasus Advances  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD ROSENBLATT
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Watch, wait and see.
</P>
<P>
   That's trainer Neil Drysdale's advice to those already
proclaiming Fusaichi Pegasus the best racehorse in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's won two major races and run six times,'' Drysdale said of
his Kentucky Derby winner, who took on seven challengers in today's
Preakness Stakes. ''We'll see how the year goes.''
</P>
<P>
   If all goes according to form, Fusaichi Pegasus will come
through as the 3-5 favorite to win the Preakness and set up an
unprecedented fourth consecutive year in which the Triple Crown
will be on the line at the Belmont Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm in '97, Real Quiet in '98 and Charismatic in '99
each won the Derby and Preakness, but fell short in the Belmont.
The last Triple Crown winner was Affirmed in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's too early to be talking about that,'' Drysdale said.
''I'm just interested in getting him ready for this race and into
the gate.''
</P>
<P>
   If Fusaichi Pegasus remains odds-on by post time (5:27 p.m.
EDT), he would be the first Preakness odds-on choice since
Spectacular Bid in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   While Drysdale appeared relaxed on Friday, he said he's still
antsy about the 1 3-16th-mile Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm always apprehensive before races,'' Drysdale told a crowd
of reporters and photographers gathered outside the Stakes Barn,
where all the Preakness horses but his are stabled. ''It's a good
field.''
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus, purchased for $4 million by Fusao Sekiguchi at
the Keeneland yearling select sale, arrived at Pimlico on Wednesday
and has been stabled in Barn 7, located on the remote backside of
Pimlico.
</P>
<P>
   Tight security went up around the barn the past three days, and
there have been complaints from the media about limited access to
the area.
</P>
<P>
   While Drysdale has expressed concern about protecting his frisky
3-year-old colt, he was unaware of how strict track officials have
been.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the first time I've heard about that,'' Drysdale said
when told several reporters and photographers were denied access to
see Fusaichi Pegasus at his barn. ''That's crazy. That's not right.
We're here because this is a nice quiet place.''
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus was to take on four horses he beat in the
Derby, plus and three newcomers, including Red Bullet, the 9-2
second choice. Fusaichi Pegasus beat the Joe Orseno-trained colt by
4\ lengths in the Wood Memorial on April 15. The other non-Derby
horses are Snuck In and Hugh Hefner.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've always been told, 'Don't duck one horse,''' Orseno said.
''You can't says he's not beatable. These are racehorses, not
machines. I don't want to take anything away from him. I just feel
I want to try him again.''
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment, Captain Steve, High Yield and Hal's Hope, who
finished third, eighth, 15th and 16th in the Derby, respectively,
planned to try again, too.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Steve, trained by Bob Baffert, was the co-third choice
along with Impeachment at 8-1. Captain Steve moved into contention
at the top of the stretch in the Derby, but was bumped by Wheelaway
and dropped back in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I really want to see is the real Captain Steve show up
and run like I know he can,'' Baffert said of his colt who was
winless in four starts this year, but won four times in eight
starts in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer D. Wayne Lukas was looking for High Yield to return to
his usual contending form after an uncharacteristic race in the
Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think when Pat found out he wasn't going to be 1-2-3, he
saved him,'' Lukas said, referring to jockey Pat Day. ''He might
not run a winning race (today), but he'll have something to say
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert trained Silver Charm and Real Quiet, and understands
what Drysdale is going through in trying to keep a Derby winner in
top condition.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's doing the right thing,'' Baffert said of Drysdale's
decision to keep Fusaichi Pegasus away from the Stakes Barn. ''His
obligation is to his horse, himself and his owner.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he leads him out there, believe me, that horse is ready to
run.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, it rained at Pimlico, and the early forecast for
today called for a chance of rain and temperatures in the 60s.
</P>
<P>
   An off track would improve the chances of several horses such as
long shots Hal's Hope and Hugh Hefner. However, Drysdale says
Fusaichi Pegasus has trained well on off tracks and ''has the
pedigree to run well'' on one.
</P>
<P>
   In winning the Wood, the colt raced under track conditions
labeled wet-fast.

<HEADLINE> Lewis Trial Could Last Weeks  </HEADLINE>
By CHAD ROEDEMEIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Fulton County Superior Court Judge Alice D.
Bonner is not pleased with the predicted length of the murder trial
of Baltimore Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Jury selection is expected to be finished Monday, and opening
statements should begin Tuesday. But the trial could last for
several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Paul Howard said Friday it will take at least
a week for the state to present its version of the fight that left
two men fatally stabbed after a Super Bowl party in Buckhead on
Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, during jury selection, Bonner told lawyers that the
trial should last no more than a week.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys, who will present their case after the
prosecution, have complained about the amount of time the district
attorney expects to take.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is zero need for 130 prosecution witnesses,'' said David
Wolfe, attorney for defendant Reginald Oakley. ''The bottom line
is, but for the notoriety that has been affixed to this case, it
ought to take about a week to try.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have said in court documents that the defendants
chased down Jacinth ''Shorty'' Baker, 21, and Richard Lollar, 24,
and started fighting with them after an argument at the Cobalt
Lounge.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers for Lewis have said the 25-year-old NFL star
didn't stab anyone and acted as a peacemaker. Oakley and Joseph
Sweeting are also charged with murder in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The court finished qualifying the jury pool Friday, and the
final jury will be selected Monday. That means opening statements
and testimony will begin Tuesday, Howard said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers asked potential jurors questions Friday designed to
reveal their background, opinions and hidden biases.
</P>
<P>
   One man, Juror No. 98, was excluded after he told prosecutors,
''It's been apparent that the defendants were involved, and I
haven't seen anything that makes me think they weren't.''
</P>
<P>
   That got the man out of jury duty, but not without a stern
reprimand from the judge: ''I hope you never need a criminal
defense lawyer, or anyone you know, love or care about does.''
Bonner said.
</P>
<P>
   The only other preliminary business will be a hearing Monday on
whether a statement Lewis gave to police on the morning after the
killings is admissible in court.

Giulinai Drops Out of Senate Race
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani stunned the polical world
today by dropping out of the race for the New York Senate, ending an engrossig
campaign against first lady Hillary Clinton. Giuliani, 55, appeared
uncharacteristically nervous and introspective as he made the announcement at a
packed City Hall news conference. He spoke in a softer, less certain voice that
he has adopted since announcing that he had prostate cancer three weeks ago,
throwing his race against Clinton into question. Giuliani said he expected to
have the strength to carry out his duties as mayor, but it was uncertain whether
his ability to govern would be hurt by any political fallout from his decision
to leave the Senate race or the turmoil in his personal life.

New Taiwan President Takes Office

   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwan's new president urged both sides of China to
discuss longstanding disputes and seek peace during his inaugural speech
Saturday. Speaking outside the red brick presidential palace, President Chen
Shui-bian said, ''The Cold War has ended. Now is the time to drop confrontations
and hostilities.'' Chen's 50-minute speech had been billed as one of his best
opportunities to relieve building pressure to forge a diplomatic breakthrough
with the island's giant communist neighbor, which has repeatedly threatened to
attack.

Cliton Scraps TV Pitch For China
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Advised by congressional Democrats that the effort could be
counterproductive, President Clinton abandoned plans to make a nationally
televised speech to pitch legislation establishing permanent normal trade
relations with China. During a political fund-raising trip to Philadelphia and
Chicago on Friday, Clinton abruptly canceled a five-minute, televised Oval
Office address on behalf of the trade bill that he had scheduled for Sunday
night. The bill would open China's markets to more U.S. goods, and end 20 years
of annual reviews of China's trade status.

Haiti Prepares For Elections

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Under pressure from Washington and the United

to restoring a legal government and vital foreign aid. Disgusted with their
politicians and despairing of a seemingly endless impoverishment, Haitians are
eager to cast their ballots: More than half the population of 8 million is
registered to vote. But a flare-up of political violence, government
foot-dragging and the bumbling preparations of Haiti's elections council could
mean trouble for the legislative and local elections, Haiti's first vote since a
disputed 1997 ballot.

baby boy early Saturday morning -- the couple's fourth child, officials said.
Cherie Blair, 45, and the baby were in good health, officials at Blair's Downing

admitted to Chelsea and Westminster hospital in west London at midday Friday.
The boy, whose name was not immediately disclosed, becomes the first child born

AIDS Vaccine To Be Tested in Uganda

   BALTIMORE (AP) -- An oral AIDS vaccine is under development at the institute
headed by Dr. Robert Gallo, co-discoverer of the virus, and is expected to
undergo human tests in Uganda in as little as 18 months. The vaccine could cost
$1 or less per dose, providing an inexpensive form of prevention in poor
countries hit hardest by AIDS, its backers said Friday. Francis Omaswa, Uganda's
director general of health services who attended the news conference, said a
vaccine is the only hope in his country, where millions of people are infected

reached deep down and summoned a dramatic comeback from an 18-point deficit to
send their series against Miami to a winner-take-all finale for the fourth
straight year. Overcoming Miami's relentless defense and their own self-doubts
after a miserable first half, the Knicks rallied past Miami 72-70 tonight to
force a deciding Game 7 on Sunday. It was an incredible comeback given the way
the Heat dominated for most of the game, but the Knicks -- like they did last
year in their improbable run to the finals -- found a way to thrive on adversity
and save their playoff lives.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani drops out of Senate race  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani ended an excruciating
three weeks of speculation about his health and marriage by
shutting the door on his bid for the U.S. Senate, less than two
weeks before the state Republican Party's nominating convention.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Rick Lazio, a relatively unknown Long Island
congressman, said he would likely seek the gritty former
prosecutor's place on the GOP ballot against Hillary Rodham
Clinton, the nation's only first lady to run for elected office.
Lazio was scheduled to announce his candidacy this afternoon in
West Islip.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he would seek a little shelter from the spotlight
while he decides how to treat the prostate cancer he was diagnosed
with last month.
</P>
<P>
   ''I used to think the core of me was in politics, probably. It
isn't,'' Giuliani said. ''When you feel your mortality and your
humanity you realize that the core of you is first of all being
able to take care of your health ... so you can be useful to the
people you really care about.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who turns 56 on May 28, appeared uncharacteristically
nervous as he made the announcement at a packed City Hall news
conference. He spoke in the softer, less certain voice he has
adopted since announcing his illness on April 27.
</P>
<P>
   His announcement Friday was made before about 40 television
cameras and a standing-room-only crowd in a public hearing room in
City Hall. City Council Republicans, his deputy mayors, campaign
staff and volunteers crowded the front pews, and rose to their feet
and applauded for a full minute when the mayor appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he expected to have the strength to carry out his
duties as mayor, but it was uncertain whether his ability to govern
would be hurt by the political fallout from his leaving the Senate
race or the turmoil in his personal life.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thank God that it gives me really another 18 months to be
the mayor of New York City,'' Giuliani told the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he would redouble efforts to reach out to those
New Yorkers left behind despite the city's economic renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to try to reach out to more people to try to help
more people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the immediate future, Giuliani must choose a treatment for
his cancer, a decision he has repeatedly said has been far more
difficult than he expected.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to deal with it clearly and completely as a personal
matter,'' he said. ''I'm going to ask you to give me a little space
to be able to make that decision properly.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he informed a coterie of friends before calling
Gov. George Pataki, state Republican Party chairman Bill Powers and
others, including Sen. John McCain and Gov. George W. Bush, the
expected Republican presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady said she had spoken with the mayor shortly after
his statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I called him at the conclusion of his announcement to wish him
well, to tell him that I knew this was a difficult decision and I
certainly hope and pray ... that he will have a full and speedy
recovery,'' said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's departure from the race propels Lazio to the
forefront of Republicans hoping to replace him in the battle for
the Senate seat being vacated by Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   During an interview Friday evening on CNN, Pataki, who has said
he would not seek the seat, voiced his support for Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rick Lazio has earned the nomination and has earned the right
to be our next senator,'' Pataki said. ''He's got an outstanding
record in Washington. He's been a fine congressman.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear what would happen to the $9 million
the Giuliani campaign has left from about $20 million raised by a
well-oiled fund-raising apparatus, much of it with solicitation
letters sent around the country to right-wing voters.
</P>
<P>
   By federal campaign law, he is allowed to give only a maximum of
$2,000 directly to another candidate, though he could donate it to
Republican Party committees that in turn could help finance another
candidate's bid.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's decision caps an extraordinary three weeks, beginning
with his disclosure April 27 of his cancer diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, when newspapers began reporting his late night
dinners in the company of a woman not his wife, the mayor described
the woman, Judith Nathan, 45, as a ''very good friend.''
</P>
<P>
   On May 10, Giuliani stunned observers, and his wife of 16 years
-- television personality and actress Donna Hanover, 50 -- by
announcing he would seek a legal separation from her.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, Hanover held her own news conference where
she said the mayor had previously had a relationship with one of
his top City Hall aides, Cristyne Lategano-Nicholas.
</P>
<P>
   Both Giuliani and Lategano-Nicholas, 35, who is now head of the
city's tourism bureau, have denied a romantic relationship.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, as the mayor made his announcement, Hanover was at
Gracie Mansion with the couple's two children, Andrew, 14, and
Caroline, 10.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mayor called Donna before the announcement and they talked
briefly and she's concerned for his health and will try to help
with that,'' said Hanover's spokeswoman, Joannie Danielides.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, Hanover's office confirmed she had hired an
attorney to handle her impending separation from Giuliani.

<HEADLINE> Fujimori Stays on Campaign Trail  </HEADLINE>

   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- President Alberto Fujimori's hips clumsily
gyrated to his campaign theme song in front of thousands of

Friday, battling for re-election against upstart Alejandro Toledo,

   With an instructive wave of Fujimori's arm, the music stopped,
and the crowd became silent.
</P>
<P>
   ''In Peru we have recovered peace,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have struggled against terrorist violence and we will not
permit any kind of violence to reappear here,'' Fujimori said.
''Especially not in Chimbote.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours earlier, police used tear gas to drive back demonstrators
who threw bottles and rocks at the campaign rally in Chimbote, 225
miles northwest of the capital, Lima. Police formed a human barrier
to keep the protesters from the 61-year-old president when he
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo, who demanded Thursday that the vote be postponed until
June 18 to correct irregularities from the first-round election on
April 9, shows no signs of slowing down either.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot participate in the May 28 election because it is
going to be an ambush,'' Toledo shouted at a massive street rally
in downtown Lima. ''They want us to participate in a fraudulent
process that is already decided.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first round, independent monitors were denied access to
tabulation centers during the tallying of votes. Final results
showed that about 1 million more ballots were cast than there were
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo supporters, many of them students, held similar rallies
Friday night in major cities across the nation to try to pressure
Fujimori into reconsidering his demand to postpone the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a new consciousness growing. It's not like before,''
said Roberto Cuba, 23, who came to cheer on Toledo. The accounting
student rejected Fujimori's characterization of Toledo's supporters
as ruffians who seek a resurgence of the political violence that
was tamed during Fujimori's 10-year presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the 1980s there were terrible protests associated with
subversion, with terrorism,'' he said. ''Now the people are
protesting because the young are thinking in another manner.''
</P>
<P>
   A commission of election monitors from the Organization of
American States has also sought a postponement of the second-round
vote. However, the election board, controlled by Fujimori
appointees, rejected the request.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department supported the OAS request for a delay
and regretted Toledo's decision to withdraw, as well as the
election board's ''hasty ruling.''
</P>
<P>
   Constitutional experts agreed that Peruvian electoral laws do
not provide for a candidate to withdraw after elections have been
called and predicted the National Election Board would allow the
runoff to take place over Toledo's objections.

<HEADLINE> Railroad Killer Awaits Decision  </HEADLINE>
By MARK BABINECK
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Prosecutors are hoping to convince a jury to
grant convicted murderer Angel Maturino Resendiz his wish to die by
lethal injection for the rape and slaying of a Houston-area doctor.
</P>
<P>
   The state has been presenting evidence of eight other slayings
in three states to which the so-called Railroad Killer has
admitted. Prosecutors plan to rest their case by midday Monday with
testimony about a Kentucky college student who was the first victim
in the two-year killing spree.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence in the 1997 beating death of Christopher Maier, 21, and
the rape and attempted killing of his girlfriend, will close three
days of often gruesome testimony and visuals.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors convicted Maturino Resendiz of capital murder Thursday in
the 1998 rape-slaying of Dr. Claudia Benton. By Friday afternoon,
the panel already had heard how the rail-riding Mexican drifter had
killed a father and daughter in southern Illinois, a young
schoolteacher in Houston and a grandmother in Fayette County,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony then shifted to the slayings of pastor Norman ''Skip''
Sirnic, 46, and his wife, Karen, 47, who were found bludgeoned by a
sledgehammer in bed on May 2, 1999 at Weimar, between Houston and
San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Neely, congregation president of the Weimar United Church,
testified that he became worried a half-hour into the scheduled
Sunday morning service when the usually prompt Sirnic had not
arrived to preach. He went behind the church and into the parsonage
to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I turned and walked into the master bedroom, and that's when I
spotted Skip. He was lying on the bed, on his stomach with his head
turned toward the door. I ran out of the house,'' Neely said.
</P>
<P>
   The last case the jury heard before retiring for the weekend was
that of Leafie Mason, an 87-year-old woman beaten to death with one
of her own antique flatirons in her Hughes Springs home. Her body
was found Oct. 2, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Kennedy, police chief in the town 55 miles south of
Texarkana, testified that he found a left palm print on a window
that turned out to be the only evidence linking Maturino Resendiz
to the crime.
</P>
<P>
   The case might forever have gone unsolved had Kennedy not had
the window -- and the grimy print -- removed in advance of a
thunderstorm.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without a doubt, those (prints) would have been destroyed had
he not taken the action to protect that glass,'' said Detective
David Stiles, a Texarkana, Ark., investigator who assisted.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors learned more about the Illinois slayings of George
Morber, 80, and daughter Carolyn Frederick, 51, on Thursday.
Prosecutors are presenting the cases in reverse chronological
order.
</P>
<P>
   The Kentucky victim's girlfriend, who was raped and left for
dead and has not been identified, will be the last prosecution
witness. Maturino Resendiz has instructed his attorneys not to
mount a defense, but they persisted Friday without interference
from their client.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after his conviction Thursday, Maturino Resendiz told
the court outside the jury's presence he wanted to die by injection
rather than get life in prison, jurors' only alternative. With
life, he would not be eligible for parole until 2039.

<HEADLINE> NATO Navies Adapt To New Realities  </HEADLINE>
By CONSTANT BRAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTO SANTO, Portugal (AP) -- Sunbathers enjoying the isolated
peace of this tiny, semitropical island could only gape in awe as
the military might of NATO descended for exercises.
</P>
<P>
   While amphibious landing vehicles and a naval armada anchored
just off the beaches, Sea King helicopters roared close to the
water and F-16 fighter jets screeched over rooftops.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the island of only 5,000 year-round inhabitants
joined in too, daubed with fake injuries to play the parts of
wounded refugees in a fictional humanitarian crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Linked Seas was based on an invented confrontation
between two countries -- ''Yellow Land'' and ''Gray Land'' -- in a
scenario similar to real crises faced by international forces in
Kosovo and East Timor. The 12-day exercise, which ended Monday, was
part of training for NATO naval forces to allow them to react
quickly to keep the peace in regional hot spots.
</P>
<P>
   According to the story line, Graylanders under Gen. Vulgar were
intent on protecting ethnic Grays in Yellowland who faced
discrimination in an economic crisis. Their forces invaded ethnic
Gray areas of Yellowland territory and NATO's goal was to prop up a
fragile cease-fire and alleviate the suffering of persecuted
locals.
</P>
<P>
   Harrier reconnaissance planes lifted off from the Spanish
aircraft carrier Asturias to survey the terrain ahead of helicopter
landings to aid the evacuation of Yellowlanders driven from their
villages by marauding Grays.
</P>
<P>
   NATO special forces landed on the island ahead of the main
operation to secure the airstrip and disarm Gray guerrilla
fighters. Some 40 Portuguese soldiers played the role of the
guerillas.
</P>
<P>
   Moving inland with jeeps, they met and aided fleeing
Yellowlanders running from their villages, many of whom hid in
shacks built on the hillsides. Some were seriously wounded, others
were in shock. Make-up artists made their wounds look very real for
the soldiers who came upon them.
</P>
<P>
   Makeshift first-aid tents were erected to handle the injured,
while medical ships on standby offshore took in the more seriously
hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ''The idea is to meet a series of challenges. ... The main thing
is to get people water and food,'' said British commando Maj. Hugh
Milner as he drove up to the village with supplies. The
humanitarian mission had to deal with 68 injured people.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are all learning,'' said Portuguese Vice-Adm. Luis Mota e
Silva, in charge of NATO's southern Atlantic forces. ''We have to
make sure we understand the problems we might face.''
</P>
<P>
   The 30,000 soldiers who participated came from 18 nations,
including the United States, France and other NATO allies alongside
new partners such as Romania, Georgia and Austria. They were backed
by around 100 warships and 120 aircraft in maneuvers stretching
from the French Atlantic coast down to Porto Santo in the Madeira
archipelago, 400 miles off the coast of Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 residents participated in the exercise, including
Porto Santo's mayor and students from local schools.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was kicked out of my village, I fled and am waiting for
help. I have not eaten for three days,'' said 20-year-old Sergio
Silva, who played a refugee.
</P>
<P>
   A real-life crisis intruded midway through the simulation, when
the British aircraft carrier H.M.S. Illustrious and support ships
were called into active duty to help bolster the U.N. peacekeeping
force in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Mota e Silva said that the situation in the West African state
was exactly the sort of operation NATO was likely to face in future
missions.
</P>
<P>
   Alliance officials said the operation cost more than $800
million, but was important to gauge the capacity of naval forces to
tackle such post-Cold War risks.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a new mission area for us, it is not what sailors from
frigates and ships do regularly,'' said U.S. Rear Adm. Thomas
Wilson, who commanded the U.S. ships.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are trying to find out exactly what our limits are,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> NRA announces plans to open theme store-restaurant in Times Square  </HEADLINE>
By LUKAS I. ALPERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck ... and Eddie Eagle?
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Eagle, a cartoon character featured in a children-oriented
gun safety program by the National Rifle Association, could be
landing in Times Square, not far from a Disney store.
</P>
<P>
   At its annual convention in Charlotte, N.C., the NRA announced
that plans are underway to open NRASports, a ''brand merchandising
venture'' in the heart of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   NRASports Blast would offer virtual-reality trap and skeet
shooting, outdoor clothing and hunting accessories. Adjacent to it
would be a restaurant -- NRASports Grille -- featuring a wild game
menu. But it won't sell guns.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anyone can open a restaurant here, and as long as it is a
legal establishment we would certainly seek to make sure they are
prosperous,'' said Brendan Sexton, the president of the Times
Square Business Improvement District.
</P>
<P>
   NRASports would join a slew of theme restaurants and stores
already in the neighborhood, including ESPNZone, the All-Star Cafe
and the WWF store. Not far away is a Harley Davidson restaurant,
Mars 2112, Planet Hollywood and the Hard Rock Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   ''More Americans participate in shooting sports than in
basketball, hockey, baseball, soccer and other sports,'' NRA
Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre said at a news conference.
LaPierre added that a lease had yet to be signed.
</P>
<P>
   Some thought the theme could work well in New York, which for
many is best symbolized by political slugfests, lunatic cab
drivers, and dirty subways.
</P>
<P>
   Others found the idea of opening an NRA outlet in the heart of
New York City a bit unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ''What? Do you have to shoot at a menu to pick your meal?'' said
Carlos Azaceta, an advertising executive from Hoboken, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know quite how well this is going to work. But hey,
this is New York. Anything goes,'' said Joyce Keller, a computer
programmer from Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Sexton also expressed some concern.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a time when Times Square was associated with a
climate of violence and weapons. That culture and symbolism is
something that we have been extremely glad to get away from,''
Sexton said.
</P>
<P>
   But Josh Sugarmann, executive director of the Violence Policy
Center, said that the proposal shows the NRA is ''bizarrely out of
sync'' with mainstream America.
</P>
<P>
   ''What will their sign say, 'Over a Million Killed'?''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Nixes TV China Trade Pitch  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Advised by congressional Democrats that the
effort could be counterproductive, President Clinton abandoned
plans to make a nationally televised speech to pitch legislation
establishing permanent normal trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   During a political fund-raising trip to Philadelphia and Chicago
on Friday, Clinton abruptly canceled a five-minute, televised Oval
Office address on behalf of the trade bill that he had scheduled
for Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   His decision followed talks with House Minority Leader Dick
Gephardt, D-Mo., and other congressional Democrats while on the
flight to Chicago, White House spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been talking with them for the past couple of days about
what's the most productive way to get votes on this,'' Palmieri
said. ''They've advised us that they don't think that the Oval
Office address is the most productive way to get votes.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would open China's markets to more U.S. goods, and end
20 years of annual reviews of China's trade status. The bill is
supported by the business community and opposed by labor,
environmental and some veterans' groups. Both sides said the vote
remains close and predicted a weekend of hard lobbying.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats had asked Gephardt, an opponent of the
legislation, to deliver a televised response to Clinton's address.
A senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said some other lawmakers who had urged Clinton to make the speech
changed their minds Friday, feeling the address would raise the
stakes for the legislation and ''make it more divisive and
high-profile than it needed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC and CBS had said they would not carry Clinton's speech. ABC
said the network had already covered both sides of the issue on its
news programs, and CBS said the address amounted to lobbying. NBC,
CNN and Fox had said they would carry it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., and other supporters of
the trade deal claimed new momentum, citing both a new
China-European Union trade agreement and a side plan backed by the
bipartisan congressional leadership for a watchdog commission to
monitor human rights in China.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will be able to have the votes necessary for a strong
victory,'' said Dreier, chairman of the House Rules Committee. He
said his panel, which sets ground rules for considering bills, will
meet Tuesday, followed by House floor debate on the measure
Wednesday and a vote either late that day or Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Five formerly undecided House members -- Democrats John LaFalce
of New York, Thomas Sawyer of Ohio and Diana DeGette of Colorado;
and Republican Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas -- announced their support
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Closing the door on China will not improve human rights in
China. It would be a step back,'' DeGette said.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents claimed three new converts to the ''no'' column: Reps.
Robert Andrews, D-N.J.; Rod R. Blagojevich, D-Ill.; and Karen
McCarthy, D-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>

<HEADLINE> Lugar Denounces Clinton Farm Effort  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration has done too little
to rejuvenate the nation's farm economy, the chairman of the Senate
Agriculture Committee said today.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although Congress and the president have agreed on the need to
provide financial help to farmers, the Clinton administration has
not focused sufficient attention on the broader problems facing
agriculture,'' Sen. Dick Lugar of Indiana said in the weekly
Republican radio address. He owns a corn and soybean farm in his
home state.
</P>
<P>
   Lugar said the administration has not worked hard enough to
lower barriers to U.S. food exports or to reduce energy prices. He
also said farmers were hurt by President Clinton's veto last year
of a $792 billion tax-cut package.
</P>
<P>
   Grain prices collapsed in 1998 and are likely to remain
relatively low through this year. Congress has provided $15 billion
over the past years to compensate for the lower prices and will
give farmers at least $7 billion more this year, Lugar said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's failure to make progress at last year's
world trade talks in Seattle ''was a major disappointment to the
agricultural community,'' he contended.
</P>
<P>
   Congress also is close to finishing work on an overhaul of the
federal subsidized crop insurance program that will sharply reduce
the premiums that farmers pay for the coverage, Lugar noted.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say farmers were harmed by passage of the 1996 Freedom
to Farm law, which lowered crop subsidies and ended a
Depression-era system of production controls.

<HEADLINE> Congress Uncertain on MLK Papers  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY McMURRAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two experts advising Congress on whether to
pay $20 million for Martin Luther King's post-1960 papers have
reached conflicting conclusions, further clouding the issue for
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   An appraiser of historical documents found the material
''absolutely stupendous'' and a bargain. King's Pulitzer
Prize-winning biographer determined the documents and artifacts
were of little research value and hardly worth becoming the Library
of Congress' most expensive purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is trying to sort through the analyses, and the
lawmaker who first proposed the idea of the purchase now doubts
whether it will go through.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we don't do this purchase, I envision some wealthy white
family going to an auction house, getting the papers, and then
selling them back to this same government 20 years from now for
$100 million,'' said Rep. James Clyburn.
</P>
<P>
   The South Carolina Democrat, who is black, persuaded President
Clinton to include money for the purchase in his budget proposal
last year.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are most of the post-1960 documents now at Atlanta's
Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change. King's
early materials are at Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   David Garrow, an Emory University professor and biographer of
the slain civil rights leader, told congressional Republicans the
collection has little research value.
</P>
<P>
   He contends the most important documents, called the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference papers, are part of a separate
collection at the King Center. King founded the SCLC, a civil
rights organization, in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   Historians contend the SCLC papers were separated from the other
documents at the King Center -- almost randomly. But King's
relatives have refused to make the SCLC papers part of any sale.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes perfect sense for the Kings to want to get out of the
historical archives business, but the King Papers are not worth $20
million,'' Garrow said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the library sent a group to Atlanta to
re-examine the papers.
</P>
<P>
   Included among the papers are items that King's widow, Coretta
Scott King, has kept in her home, such as her husband's books from
college and divinity school. But Garrow, who says he reviewed the
entire collection, contends most of the items have autograph value
at best.
</P>
<P>
   ''The great bulk of the King Papers is incoming fan mail from
the general public and the SCLC papers, which Congress can't
have,'' Garrow said.
</P>
<P>
   In sharp disagreement is Willis VanDevanter, who appraised the
papers for the library. He concluded that the asking price was fair
and called Garrow's assessment ''absolute poppycock.''
</P>
<P>
   VanDevanter said the SCLC documents held little value compared
with the rest of the Atlanta collection.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a number of self-anointed preachers who seem to
think they're the authority on the papers, but this is absolutely
stupendous material,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's, the New York auction house, appraised the papers at
$30 million, and VanDevanter's estimate was just a little below
that. The King family has told Clyburn it would settle for $20
million to keep the papers under one roof.
</P>
<P>
   But some in Congress have questioned the family's motives.
</P>
<P>
   ''I suppose from that standpoint, the King family would have us
believe we're getting a bargain,'' said Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga. ''They
have an interest in jacking up the price.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the cost, other questions have emerged. Among them:
Which documents would be included? Does the library already own any
of them on microfilm? And would the intellectual property rights go
to the library or would researchers have to petition the King
family to use the material?
</P>
<P>
   A family spokesman refused to answer these questions and said no
family member would be available to talk about the proposed sale.
</P>
<P>
   ''My concern is that Congress is being duped,'' said Louise
Cook, who was the director of the King Library, Archives and Museum
when the papers arrived in the 1980s. ''I don't think Congress
understands that they're not getting everything they should get.''

<HEADLINE> China Displeased With Taiwan Chief  </HEADLINE>
By ELAINE KURTENBACH
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- China parried newly inaugurated Taiwan President
Chen Shui-bian's calls for peace talks Saturday by accusing him of
insincerity and warning that unification could not be postponed
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   The statement issued by the Taiwan office of the State Council,
China's Cabinet, and the Taiwan department of the ruling Communist
Party's Central Committee was restrained in tone but it reiterated
Beijing's threats that moves toward independence would mean war.
</P>
<P>
   ''If anyone dares to try to split Taiwan from China, he will
bear historical responsibility for causing a resumption of China's
civil war,'' said the statement carried by the official Xinhua News
Agency and read on state-run television.
</P>
<P>
   China and Taiwan split amid civil war 51 years ago, and Beijing
has threatened to attack if the island seeks formal independence or
stalls indefinitely on starting talks on unification.
</P>
<P>
   Following Chen's election in March, Chinese leaders urged him to
prove his good intentions by explicitly recognizing Taiwan is part
of ''one China.'' In his speech, however, Chen made only a passing
reference to that demand, saying he believed leaders on both sides
have the ''wisdom and creativity to jointly deal with the question
of a future 'one China.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government's statement expressed dissatisfaction,
although it acknowledged Chen's promises not to declare
independence or to demand China treat Taiwan as a separate,
sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's inaugural speech ''avoided the crucial issue of accepting
the one-China policy; the attitude is evasive and vague,'' it said.
''Obviously, his 'goodwill reconciliation' lacks sincerity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government statement also repeated Beijing's
willingness to resume talks with Taipei, but only if the Taiwan
side clearly ''commit themselves to adhering to the one-China
principle.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Acceptance of the one-China principle is the touchstone of
whether or not the Taiwan leader will safeguard national
sovereignty and territorial integrity or will continue to
stubbornly pursue the separatist policy of 'Taiwan independence,'''
it said.
</P>
<P>
   China appeared unlikely to take any sudden, drastic actions. Its
leaders have pledged to wait and see what Chen, Taiwan's first
president from an opposition party, does after his inauguration.
Most suspicious to Beijing is his Democratic Progressive Party's
support for independence, although Chen has backed away from that
position.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead of Chen's speech China's state-run media briefly ceased
attacking Chen; for the first time in weeks, the morning papers
carried no commentaries on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The sole exception was the military newspaper People's
Liberation Army Daily, which ran a half-page, page-three
advertisement declaring ''China can not be broken'' in English and
Chinese. It included a ceramic dragon patterned plate with a small
piece broken off from the lower right-hand side -- similar to
Taiwan's proximity toward the mainland.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Future in Lebanon Unknown  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA KING
<TEXT>
<P>
   SIDON, Lebanon (AP) -- These are heady days for Hezbollah, the
Shiite Muslim guerrilla army that spent nearly two decades locked
in bloody battle to drive Israeli troops out of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Yet now, on the eve of what Hezbollah calls a glorious victory,
its future has never been more uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   With the last Israeli troops to be gone from south Lebanon
within weeks, Hezbollah's fighters could find themselves rebels
without a real cause -- and perhaps, ultimately, without a patron.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrilla group is vowing to fight on. But in reality, its
continued existence as an armed force hinges on whether its backer,
Syria, chooses to pursue peace with Israel or allows the guerrillas
to keep waging a proxy war after Israel's pullout.
</P>
<P>
   In the rocky hills of south Lebanon, Israel's exodus -- to be
completed by a self-imposed deadline of July 7, but probably sooner
-- is accelerating. Military hardware is rolling back across the
border, and Israeli soldiers have been handing over heavily
fortified positions to their allied militia, the South Lebanon
Army.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats and military sources estimate that only a few hundred
Israeli troops remain, hunkered down in bunkerlike outposts,
keeping movements to an absolute minimum to limit exposure to
relentless guerrilla artillery attacks. Three Israeli soldiers were
hurt, two seriously, in such strikes last week.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, which lost more than 1,000 soldiers in the 18-year
conflict, says it is pulling out of Lebanon on its own terms, and
for its own reasons. But Hezbollah, unsurprisingly, is full of
colorful boasts of how its fighters inflicted humiliating defeat on
the much-vaunted Israeli military machine.
</P>
<P>
   ''We raise our flags while theirs burn,'' said Sheik Nabil
Kaouk, a gimlet-eyed, turban-clad senior Hezbollah commander.
''Their soldiers hid in bunkers that became their graveyards.
Israel tried to establish a state in south Lebanon, but all their
schemes failed miserably.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides say the coming weeks could be bloody ones. Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak says the pullout will proceed as planned
no matter how fiercely the guerrillas attack -- ''We are not leaving
a rose garden,'' the former general says bluntly -- while Hezbollah
has been making fire-breathing pronouncements to the effect that
the last Israeli troops will be lucky to get out alive.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do they expect a farewell present from us?'' said Kaouk, 37, a
veteran Hezbollah fighter. ''We'll give them gifts -- more bodies of
their dead to bring home.''
</P>
<P>
   Until lately, Hezbollah was close-mouthed about its intentions
once the Israelis were gone. But it recently declared its fighters
will not lay down their weapons as long as Israel's allied militia,
the South Lebanon Army, is active and armed.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking simultaneously to terrorize the SLA and woo potential
defectors, Hezbollah's leader, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, warned
militiamen there would be no mercy after Israel departs. ''By God,
we will enter your homes and slaughter you in your beds!'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, though, the guerrillas offered clemency to any
SLA soldier who kills an Israeli soldier, or one of his own
officers.
</P>
<P>
   While Hezbollah's appetite for battle might be undiminished in
the wake of the Israeli withdrawal, the same cannot be said for the
Lebanese public.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas' fight to drive out Israel has been a popular
cause nationwide, even when Hezbollah's cross-border attacks have
brought Israeli reprisals down on all of Lebanon. After Israeli
troops have left, though, that could quickly change.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be an entirely different calculation then,'' said
Farid el-Khazen, a political scientist at the American University
of Beirut. ''If Hezbollah is seen as causing more fighting --
fighting that people see as unnecessary -- public opinion would turn
against them. And they are very, very sensitive to public
opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   That is especially true now, as Hezbollah seeks to wield greater
political influence. Parliamentary elections are due this summer,
and the group -- drawing on electoral backing from among 1.2 million
Shiite Muslims, Lebanon's largest sect -- hopes to build on the
seven seats it now holds in the 128-member body.
</P>
<P>
   Away from the war front, Hezbollah has become a formidable
social force, building a network of schools, clinics and social
services. In the group's stronghold of south Beirut, a gleaming,
marble-floored Hezbollah hospital boasts the latest lab equipment
and offers health care at a deep discount to the neighborhood's
poor.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not done to gain political support -- this is our
community,'' said hospital administrator Mohammed Hijazi.
</P>
<P>
   But as Islamic groups throughout the region know, such
on-the-ground services can translate into a loyal following. ''I
ask God to bless them ... We must do all we can to advance their
goals,'' said Nawal Yassin, 33, swathed in a black veil and
cradling her sick 11-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   A similar investment in the future is being made at Hezbollah's
10 schools nationwide. The curriculum emphasizes Koranic studies,
with celebrations of holidays like the Week of the Islamic
Resistance, but students also get a solid grounding in math, hard
sciences and foreign languages.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some people think of Hezbollah fighters as terrorists,'' Ahmed
Kasir, principal at the flagship south Beirut campus. ''But we try
to teach the children that our fight with Israel is a legitimate
one, and that being martyred for an important cause is an honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Created with Iranian backing in 1982, Hezbollah has become much
less militant as time has passed. In its shadowy early years, it
was linked, despite its denials, to the 1983 bombing of a Marine
Corps barracks in Beirut that killed 241 U.S. servicemen and to the
kidnappings of dozens of foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   These days, even the movement's most ardent partisans
acknowledge that Hezbollah's longstanding goal of an Islamic state
in Lebanon -- a country splintered among 18 recognized sects -- is an
unlikely dream.
</P>
<P>
   Beirut, a cosmopolitan playground before huge swaths of it were
leveled in the 1975-1990 civil war, is now engaged in a frenzy of
rebuilding heavy on luxury hotels, plush office buildings and swank
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Once Hezbollah's young enforcers roamed the capital, trying to
curb un-Islamic behavior like card-playing and bar-hopping. Now the
group's home turf in south Beirut is dotted with American fast-food
chains, and one of its offices is upstairs from the Romance
Lingerie Boutique, featuring a windowful of skimpy lace underwear.
</P>
<P>
   The big decisions about Hezbollah's future, though, are not
likely to be made on the battlefield, at the ballot box, or in its
own suites of offices -- but rather in Iran and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Iran is believed to provide the group with $10 million to $20
million a month, and Syria serves as the principal conduit for its
cash and weaponry. Some diplomats believe that if Hezbollah is seen
as having served its purpose in south Lebanon, the money and arms
will dry up.
</P>
<P>
   After the Israeli pullout, Syria could keep sponsoring Hezbollah
strikes on Israel itself to try to force a peace deal resulting in
a handover of the Golan Heights. But that would carry the threat of
Israeli retaliation against Syrian targets, a risk Damascus might
be unwilling to run.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah, which has lost more than 1,250 fighters since 1982,
is eager to keep up the battle, even once it is deprived of an
unambiguous goal -- forcing Israel out of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our Islamic beliefs make us strong in our ability to
sacrifice,'' Kaouk said. ''There is no reason for this to change.''

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Had 'Home Field' Benefit  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA KING
<TEXT>
<P>
   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) -- The pages of military textbooks are full of
matchups like this one. A small band of guerrillas, fighting on
home turf, takes on a far more powerful invading army. Which one
wins?
</P>
<P>
   Israel insists it didn't suffer a military defeat in southern
Lebanon. Nonetheless, its troops are leaving -- and the Shiite
Muslim fighters of Hezbollah, who led the fight to drive them out,
are declaring victory.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime diplomatic and military observers of the conflict paint
a portrait of a guerrilla army whose determination, ingenuity and
ruthlessness made up for its small, relatively low-tech arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   During the nearly two decades of Israeli occupation, Hezbollah
rarely fielded more than several hundred guerrillas at any given
time, but had thousands of armed supporters. Its ranks were largely
drawn from Shiite Muslim villages of southern Lebanon, giving its
fighters not only an intimate knowledge of the terrain -- which they
exploited to the fullest -- but also the support of local people.
</P>
<P>
   Israel allied itself with a locally recruited, partially
conscripted militia force, the South Lebanon Army, whose ranks were
highly susceptible to infiltration, security experts say. While
Israel had detailed aerial surveillance on its side, Hezbollah's
intelligence from human sources was often superior.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis and SLA increasingly took to fortified bunkers to
defend themselves, but Hezbollah fighters stayed on the move,
staging hit-and-run attacks and slipping away before Israeli air
strikes could be called in.
</P>
<P>
   The core of Hezbollah fighters developed years of battlefield
experience. Israeli soldiers, most of them young, usually served
rotations lasting only a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah's battlefield losses -- 1,259 dead since 1982, by its
own count -- did not daunt the guerrillas, whose ideology glorified
martyrdom. With close to the same level of losses -- more than 1,000
dead -- Israeli public support for a pullout mounted along with the
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah was by no means immune to costly errors. In earlier
days, it staged reckless human-wave assaults on Israeli positions.
It also engaged in a long and bloody power struggle with Amal, a
rival Shiite militia.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah's arsenal was relatively unsophisticated, consisting
mainly of sniper rifles, mortars, rocket-propelled grenades and
Soviet-designed Katyusha rockets. It used technology sparingly, but
with devastating effect: night-vision equipment to ambush patrols,
remote-detonated roadside bombs that killed some top Israeli
commanders and armor-piercing rockets capable of destroying
Israel's massive Merkava battle tanks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Israel learned that its weapons were not enough,'' said Sheik
Nabil Kaouk, a senior Hezbollah commander. ''It was a war of minds.
... For all our problems on the battlefield, we found solutions.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Backs Heart Devices  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Saturday he wants
heart-starting defibrillators placed in federal office buildings
and airplanes to help save the lives of people who suffer sudden
heart failure.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency devices, which use electric shock to start a heart
in cardiac arrest, are already becoming available at shopping malls
and businesses. Clinton said one recently was used to save a life
at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''The key of survival is the speed of response,'' Clinton said
in his weekly radio address. ''In addition to CPR, most cardiac
arrest victims need an immediate electrical shock to restore the
heart's normal rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   ''When victims receive that shock within a minute, there's a 90
percent chance of resuscitation,'' he said. ''When it takes 10
minutes, the odds fall to less than 5 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he will direct the Department of Health and Human
Services and the General Services Administration to write
guidelines for putting defibrillators in all federal buildings.
</P>
<P>
   To support the effort, three manufacturers will donate the
devices. The American Red Cross and the American Heart Association
have volunteered to train federal employees in using
defibrillators.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they foresaw the need.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am happy to say that after many years of hard work on
promoting external defibrillators, the House of Representatives
will vote on legislation on Tuesday to help save the lives of
cardiac arrest victims,'' said Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., chairman
of the House Republican Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the newest models are about the same size and price
of a laptop computer, use voice commands to lead users through each
step and deliver a shock only if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   About 250,000 Americans suffer from sudden cardiac arrest each
year, according to the heart association. About 5 percent survive.
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation can buy time, but cannot restart a
heart. Defibrillators can jolt a heart into beating again.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also announced that the Federal Aviation Administration
will soon require airlines to carry defibrillators on all domestic
and international flights. Eight major and six regional airlines
either now carry or have made a commitment to carry defibrillators,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines will have three years to buy the defibrillators and
develop training programs.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of American Airlines applauded Clinton's announcement,
saying 11 passengers have been saved by the devices since they were
installed on the carrier's planes in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The president also said he supported a bill that the House
Commerce Committee's health and environment panel approved earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, introduced by Rep. Cliff Stearns, R-Fla., aims to
get defibrillators in federal buildings and also grant legal
immunity to people who use them to help someone suffering from
sudden cardiac arrest in public or private buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just last week a visitor here at the White House collapsed and
would have died if not for one of the AEDs (automated external
defibrillators) that our medical unit acquired last year,'' Clinton
said.

<HEADLINE> GOP Steps Up Farm Aid Effort  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional Republicans hope to rejuvenate
the nation's farm economy with a $7 billion aid package to help
compensate for the Clinton administration's mistakes, the chairman
of the Senate Agriculture Committee said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although Congress and the president have agreed on the need to
provide financial help to farmers, the Clinton administration has
not focused sufficient attention on the broader problems facing
agriculture,'' Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana said Saturday in the
weekly Republican radio address.
</P>
<P>
   Lugar, who owns a corn and soybean farm in Indiana, said the
administration has not worked hard enough to lower barriers to U.S.
food exports or to reduce energy prices. He also said farmers were
hurt by President Clinton's veto last year of a $792 billion
tax-cut package.
</P>
<P>
   Grain prices collapsed in 1998 and are likely to remain
relatively low through this year. To compensate for lower prices,
Congress is finalizing a package to provide at least $7 billion
this year to those worst off, Lugar said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's failure to make progress at last year's
world trade talks in Seattle ''was a major disappointment to the
agricultural community,'' he contended.
</P>
<P>
   Congress also is close to finishing work on an overhaul of the
federal subsidized crop insurance program that will sharply reduce
the premiums that farmers pay for the coverage, Lugar noted.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say farmers were harmed by passage of the 1996 Freedom
to Farm law, which lowered crop subsidies and ended a
Depression-era system of production controls.

<HEADLINE> Philippines, Rebels Might Negotiate  </HEADLINE>
By JIM GOMEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOLO, Philippines (AP) -- After weeks of effort, formal talks on
freedom for 21 Western and Asian hostages held by separatist Muslim
rebels in the Philippine jungle could start this week, negotiators
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary discussions have been complicated by rebel
skirmishes with the military and frequent changes in the government
negotiating team. But pending approval from Philippine President
Joseph Estrada, talks could begin Monday or Tuesday, negotiators
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Libyan envoy Abdul Rajab Azzarouq and negotiator
Farouk Hussein visited the rebels' camp to discuss a date and place
for talks. The two asked again for a written list of demands, chief
negotiator Robert Aventajado said. In preliminary talks, the rebels
demands have included creation of an Islamic state here.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators also talked with the hostages and brought a
satellite phone for them to use.
</P>
<P>
   ''We found them in good shape, All of them. Particularly the
German lady,'' Azzarouq said. ''She's OK now.''
</P>
<P>
   German hostage Renate Wallert, 57, has improved since she began
taking medicine for her high blood pressure. Her husband and one
son, also captives, had feared that she suffered two strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Using the satellite phone, Wallert got the opportunity to talk
with relatives, Azzarouq said. Her husband, Werner Wallert, told
Hussein that the hostages are starting to adjust to the situation.
He said it is easier now that they are staying put rather than
dodging the military and sleeping in huts instead of out in the
open.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf is the smaller and more radical of two guerrilla
groups fighting for an Islamic state in the impoverished southern
Philippines. The group brought world attention to a rebellion that
has simmered for decades when it kidnapped 21 people from a
Malaysian diving resort on April 23 and brought them to the island
of Jolo, about an hour away. The captives include three Germans,
two French, two Finns, two South Africans, a Lebanese, nine
Malaysians and two Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200,000 people have been displaced by rising violence
in the south since last month, when the army attacked a stretch of
highway held by the larger rebel group, the Moro Islamic Liberation
Front. Though fighting and most bomb attacks are limited to
scattered areas of the region, home to the mostly Christian
country's Muslim minority, police and troops are on alert
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Grenade attacks and a bomb in the busy markets in Jolo and the
nearby city of Zamboanga killed eight people Thursday and wounded
55. A day earlier, a bomb exploded in an upscale Manila shopping
center, wounding at least 13 people.
</P>
<P>
   No immediate link was announced to the Muslim rebels.
Authorities were sending fragments of the bomb to the United States
for testing.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Students Protest Suharto  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- On the eve of the second anniversary
of Suharto's downfall, more than 500 students protested in front of
the ex-dictator's home Saturday, demanding he be brought to trial
for alleged corruption during 32 years in power.
</P>
<P>
   Students burned posters of the former strongman and chanted
slogans, while hundreds of police stood guard, forming a barrier
about 1,600 feet from Suharto's home.
</P>
<P>
   In a move to pre-empt any violence on the anniversary, the
attorney general investigating Suharto told a news conference
Friday that Suharto would face trial by Aug. 10.
</P>
<P>
   However, Attorney General Marzuki Darusman also said that if
Suharto's family failed to cooperate with his investigation, he
would water down its security arrangements, seemingly giving
student groups the green light to organize rowdy protests in front
of Suharto's house.
</P>
<P>
   Last week students clashed with police in demonstrations to mark
the second anniversary of the slaying of four university students
by police.
</P>
<P>
   At least one journalist was injured after police fired tear gas
at the protesters. Several people were later arrested for setting
fire to a local police station.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto, 79, is the leading suspect in a scandal involving the
misuse of millions of dollars from charitable foundations he once
controlled. A violent pro-democracy movement forced him to resign
on May 21, 1998, but he left behind a legacy of endemic corruption
and nepotism.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid defended his
suggestion to lift the ban on communist ideology, which Suharto
imposed in 1966 after he seized power.
</P>
<P>
   ''I suggest we revoke the decree banning the teaching of
communism,'' he said on television. ''We have to respect human
rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Wahid has previously called the ban undemocratic and
unconstitutional. He has been criticized by Muslim groups opposed
to communism's atheist principles.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 500,000 leftists were slaughtered by troops under
Suharto's command in the aftermath of a still-unexplained military
mutiny. Suharto claimed it was instigated by the Indonesian
Communist Party. The party was banned, although no direct link with
the abortive coup was ever proven.

<HEADLINE> Environmentalists call GE's Hudson River ads misleading  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM F. HAMMOND Jr.
The Daily Gazette
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- General Electric Co.'s new advertising
campaign against dredging PCBs from the Hudson River is
''misleading'' and ought to be withdrawn by the company,
environmental groups said.
</P>
<P>
   The ads began appearing in newspapers and on radio and TV last
week. They highlight the fact that many local governments in the
upper Hudson Valley are on record opposing a dredging project
currently being weighed by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some activists are urging the EPA to order dredging in the
Hudson,'' one of the newspaper ads reads. ''But elected leaders in
over 50 communities have voted against it. The river has made a
remarkable comeback. Let's think hard before we undo all the good
that's been done.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups, who passionately support dredging,
denounced the ads as misleading ''propaganda'' designed to stir up
public opposition. They said many of the town resolutions against
dredging were taken more than three years ago, and don't
necessarily reflect current public opinion in those communities.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm here to tell you that the people in the North Country are
on propaganda overload,'' said David Higby of Environmental
Advocates, who lives in Salem, Washington County. ''I'm part of
that community, and I'm not of that mind. So I'm offended.''
</P>
<P>
   They also say that 60 municipalities farther south in the Hudson
Valley, along with 40 community groups, are on record in support of
a cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is essentially lying with statistics,'' said Andrew Mele
of the Hudson River Sloop Clearwater. ''You just don't show the
part of the picture that refutes what you're claiming.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Behan, a GE spokesman, said it's the environmentalists
who are stretching the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's amusing that environmental groups would seek to deny that
there is widespread opposition to dredging in the upper Hudson
River,'' Behan said. ''They know it well.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that many of the local governments adopted their
anti-dredging resolutions years ago, but he said GE checked to make
sure they had not changed their position. Some have recently
reconfirmed their votes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Behan also said he doubted very many local governments have
formally taken the other side.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there were 60 communities that supported dredging in the
Hudson River, they would have produced a list a long time ago,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   GE plants in Hudson Falls and Fort Edward legally dumped waste
water containing PCBs into the Hudson River for several decades,
until the practice was banned in the 1970s. The EPA is now studying
whether sediments contaminated with the chemicals, which are
suspected of causing various health problems, should be dredged at
the company's expense. A decision from the agency is expected late
this year.

<HEADLINE> Russia Arrests Suspect in Bombing  </HEADLINE>
By ZAIRA MAGOMEDOVA
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) -- Police arrested a suspect Saturday in
an apartment bombing that killed 64 people in the republic of
Dagestan last year, the first of a series of attacks across Russia
that helped bring about the war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   An Interior Ministry official in the Dagestani capital of
Makhachkala said that Isa Zainutdinov, a Dagestani resident, was
suspected of being a ''major perpetrator'' of the bomb attack on an
apartment building in Buinaksk.
</P>
<P>
   According to the spokesman, 62-year-old Zainutdinov admitted he
drove a truckload of explosives to the apartment block, but claimed
that he was unaware of its intended use. The blast shattered an
apartment block that housed military officers and their families.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing was the first of four apartment blasts around Russia
last September that left about 300 people dead. Russia blamed the
attacks on rebels from Chechnya, which neighbors Dagestan, but had
yet to report any major breakthroughs in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops entered Chechnya in September after
Chechnya-based Islamic militants seized several villages in
Dagestan and the wave of attacks on apartment buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Chechnya on Saturday, the Russian military command said
federal forces repelled a band of rebels attempting to infiltrate
two towns in Russian-controlled central Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian troops opened fire on the guerrillas as they
attempted to approach the towns of Shali and Serzhen-Yurt, 11 miles
southeast of the capital Grozny, on Friday, and forced them to
retreat to a stronghold near the village of Mashtak to the south,
the command's press center said.
</P>
<P>
   Two rebels were killed in the clash, the command claimed. There
was no report of Russian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   The press center again warned that the rebels may intensify
their guerrilla campaign on the orders of rebel Chechen President
Aslan Maskhadov. ''His earlier circulated order to the rebels was
to step up combat against federal forces at this time,'' the center
said.
</P>
<P>
   The military has been saying for a week that Maskhadov has
ordered rebels to go on the offensive this weekend, but many
militants operate outside Maskhadov's control and a new major
military offensive has yet to materialize.
</P>
<P>
   The command said groups of rebels, led by field commander Shamil
Basayev and the warlord known as Khattab, were operating in eastern
Chechnya, near Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   ''The extremists tend to concentrate near populated areas where,
despite the local population's resistance, they try to replenish
their food supplies and obtain information on the federal troops'
activity,'' the command said.

<HEADLINE> Four debates in eight days leave Corzine unscathed and Florio scrambling </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDISON, N.J. (AP) -- For Jim Florio, outspent by a candidate who
has most of the Democratic Party's weight on his side, last week's
debates in the primary race for U.S. Senate were a much-awaited
chance at an even playing field.
</P>
<P>
   Eight days and four debates later, while Florio had shown
himself the more skilled speaker, it was nevertheless he who was
hobbling off that even field.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine did appear rattled occasionally by the pressure of the
debates and the harsh barrages of an opponent whose answers and
attacks were more compactly phrased. But Corzine made no blunder
that would haunt him.
</P>
<P>
   ''He survived,'' said Rider University political analyst David
Rebovich. ''I agree with folks who say he was nervous. He did
stumble a couple of times. But the debates did not disqualify
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rebovich said Florio got the chance at the most exposure to date
for his campaign effort and it ended up as something of a missed
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ''Florio would have been wiser, instead of just attacking
Corzine for the Goldman Sachs connection, he should have tried to
turn the debate into more specifics,'' Rebovich said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with two weeks to go and Corzine refusing an invitation to
debate on network television, the race returns to traditional
street campaigning and Corzine's heavy spending, roughly $17
million to $20 million so far.
</P>
<P>
   More than missing chances to score, Florio by the end of the
debate cycle was blocking punches after a mistake of his own
regarding a flip-flop of views on Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   The weekly New Jersey Jewish News released a tape recording of
Florio in May 1999 endorsing the investment of a small fraction of
Social Security funds in the stock market, but since then Florio
has caustically attacked Corzine for proposing the exact same
thing.
</P>
<P>
   The mistake came out as a result of the debates.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish News editor, David Twersky, said Florio in the first
debate on New Jersey Network implied the reporter who wrote it had
admitted being wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reporter indicated there may have been some
misunderstanding. There are no quotes,'' Florio said.
</P>
<P>
   Twersky said that answer ''kind of got my Irish up and I asked
the reporter for her notes, and she found the tape.''
</P>
<P>
   It had Florio saying: ''I have no difficulty with a relatively
small, segmented portion of the Social Security trust fund monies
being put into equities, and we should put them in, in the same way
that we put those types of resources into teachers' funds and other
public agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Florio ended his denunciations when the tape was made public. At
Thursday's final debate he said, ''The transcript that came out
clearly indicates I misspoke. I did not think it was a good idea in
the past. I do not think it is a good idea now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Corzine campaign denounced Florio as a liar, and Rebovich
said it undercut Florio's attempt to portray himself as a veteran
who knows what he is doing.
</P>
<P>
   ''It really is unbelievable,'' Rebovich said. ''You are claiming
to be this experienced politician who knows how to function in the
Washington D.C. arena. Then how do you misspeak on such an
important issue?''
</P>
<P>
   Florio during the debates did squeeze Corzine into several
corners, most notably getting him to defend the gun industry
Tuesday before an audience of 500 in Livingston, a debate that was
not telecast.
</P>
<P>
   ''While I was taking on the gun lobby, Jon was financing the gun
industry,'' Florio charged.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine replied, ''I hope the governor isn't suggesting we have
a ban on guns, or is he suggesting that Smith &AMP; Wesson and
Remington, who sell guns to our military operations, legally, are
somehow operating outside the law?''
</P>
<P>
   The next day Corzine told the New York Times he would have
opposed financing gun manufacturers had he known about it while at
Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   Florio in the debates also pressed Corzine into detailing his
views in support of gay marriage, open enlistment of gays in the
military and a moratorium on all executions because of concerns
over racism in the judicial system.
</P>
<P>
   None of those were errors, but they do help Florio -- and any
potential Republican opponents -- put Corzine on the liberal fringe.
Notably, Corzine avoids those issues on his elaborately detailed
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Florio also may have drawn in an unneeded opponent -- his nemesis
of the 1993 election, Gov. Christie Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   At Monday's radio debate, and again Thursday, Florio said racial
profiling by the New Jersey State Police picked up after he had
left office.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a falloff in some of the incidents that were
reported to us, particularly by the ACLU (American Civil Liberties
Union), which was monitoring these things. Then after I left
office, apparently there was a picking up again of this and so when
the United States Justice Department came to New Jersey and
reviewed the records for 10 years back, they concluded there was a
sufficient pattern of this sort of activity from 1995 on, so as to
be able to file complaints.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman was out of the country last week but her spokeswoman,
Jayne O'Connor, accused Florio of rewriting history. She said
federal agencies began investigating the State Police after a 1996
state court ruling concerning patrol practices on the New Jersey
Turnpike for several previous years, including the four during
which Florio was governor.

<HEADLINE> Key Players in China Trade Bill  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Key players in this week House debate on China trade:
President Clinton
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clinton is making the bill to grant permanent trade benefits to
China a major foreign policy initiative of his final year in
office. He is lobbying energetically down to the wire, inviting
lawmakers to the White House to engage in personal persuasion.
House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, DeLay, one of Clinton's most caustic critics and a
leader in the 1999 impeachment effort, has become a principal ally
on the China-trade vote. Delay has become the point man for
rounding up Republican votes. Because far more Republicans are
supporting the legislation than Democrats, Clinton must rely on him
for the bulk of the support.
Reps. Sander Levin, D-Mich., and Doug Bereuter, R-Neb.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they drafted a bipartisan side agreement designed to
bridge differences and pick up additional support for the China
trade bill. It would create a commission to monitor human rights in
China and set up a mechanism for protecting U.S. businesses from
surges in certain imports from China. Their proposal has been
embraced by both the Clinton administration and Republican leaders,
who plan to incorporate it into the underlying trade bill. Levin is
the senior Democrat on the Ways and Means trade subcommittee and
Bereuter is chairman of the International Relations subcommittee on
Asia.
House Minority Whip David Bonior, D-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   The top vote-counter among Democrats, Bonior, long a close ally
of organized labor, has been leading the opposition to the bill.
House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   As the top Democrat in the House, Gephardt has walked a careful
path in not seeking to make the trade vote a party matter. He
opposes the legislation, but has let others do most of the work in
opposing it. Still, as the senior Democrat, his views carry a lot
of weight among Democrats.
Rep. Robert Matsui, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   With both Gephardt and Bonior opposing the bill, the job of
trying to rally Democratic support has fallen mostly to Matsui, a
leading congressional advocate of expanding international commerce
and improved ties with China. He has been keeping daily of
Democrats on board, a sometimes daunting task.
Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   As senior Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee and as
a senior member of the Congressional Black Caucus, Rangel has a lot
of pull among Democrats. A usual ally of organized labor, Rangel
remained on the fence on the trade bill until last week. But his
announcement of support was viewed as instrumental in bringing in
other Democratic votes -- and he is now working actively to try to
pass the bill.

<HEADLINE> Emotions Range on China Trade Bill  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As the House heads for a showdown this week on
granting China permanent trade benefits, both sides agree the
legislation will help shape U.S.-Chinese relations for the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents suggest it would reward human rights abusers and
flood U.S. markets with cheap goods, while supporters argue it
would open Chinese markets to U.S. companies and improve conditions
by exporting American values.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, the dwindling number of undecided House
members faced an intensive lobbying campaign, from television and
radio ads to letter-writing campaigns and visits to congressional
districts.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents claimed momentum and said they were close to the 218
votes needed for passage. But lawmakers on both sides agreed the
vote, expected late Wednesday or on Thursday, could be razor close.
</P>
<P>
   Approval seemed certain in the Senate, which was waiting for the
House to act first.
</P>
<P>
   Organized labor, joined by environmental and some labor groups,
led the fight against the plan to give China permanent normal trade
relations. Corporate America worked aggressively for the bill, one
of President Clinton's top foreign policy priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking further support, Republican leaders agreed late last
week to link the bill with separate legislation creating a
commission to monitor human rights in China.
</P>
<P>
   The trade bill has caused political turbulence, with Democrats
pitted against Democrats and Clinton uneasily aligned with the same
Republican leaders who voted to impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   The president planned to promote the trade bill in a nationally
television address Sunday night from the Oval Office. He canceled
the speech Friday night after hearing from congressional Democrats
that such a high-profile appeal might cost him some House votes.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would end the current practice of renewing
China's favorable trading status annually and extend it to Beijing
on a permanent basis. The United States would give China the same
access to U.S. markets it now routinely gives nearly every other
country.
</P>
<P>
   ''Establishing free and fair trade relations with China is good
for American jobs, it is good for American workers and it is good
for our national security,'' says House Speaker Dennis Hastert,
R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Counters House Democratic Whip David Bonior of Michigan, a
staunch labor ally: ''The China trade deal won't help us export
American products -- only American jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   ''After all, how many cell phones and microscopes, how many SUVs
and microwave ovens, can you sell to Chinese factory workers
earning 13 cents an hour? Sure, we'll see more business investment
in China -- but it will be to manufacture products for export back
to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The annual votes on China have been used as leverage to apply
pressure on human rights, religious freedom and other issues. But
not once has Congress denied the trade preference to China, even
after the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   ''The annual review over the last 20 years has been kind of a
meaningless act,'' said Rep. Robert Matsui, D-Calif., a leading
China-trade bill sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   The permanent status is linked to China's entry into the
135-nation World Trade Organization, the Geneva-based organization
that oversees global trade.
</P>
<P>
   China was one of the charter members of the WTO's predecessor,
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, when it was formed
after the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   China resigned in 1950, a year after the communists seized
power. For the past 13 years, China has tried to rejoin. The last
obstacle was removed Friday when Beijing completed a trade
agreement with the 35-member European Union.
</P>
<P>
   While the China trade vote is often portrayed as necessary for
China's entry into the WTO, it has no direct bearing on China's
membership. China soon will join the WTO regardless of
congressional action.
</P>
<P>
   But, in exchange for the Clinton administration's support for
its WTO bid, China agreed to a series of market-opening concessions
for U.S. companies in a landmark trade agreement in November.
</P>
<P>
   While most U.S. markets already are open to Chinese goods, China
promised to lower various tariffs and other barriers to U.S.
investments.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, for instance, would allow U.S. banks to operate
branches in China and permit U.S. companies to operate in China
without having to form joint ventures, as they do now.
</P>
<P>
   Under WTO rules, trade concessions China gives to any one
country to gain entry to the WTO must be extended to all other WTO
members. But to gain those benefits for American exporters,
Congress must grant China permanent normal trade relations,
scrapping the annual review.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional rejection of the China bill threatens the United
States' chance of sharing in the market-access concessions all
other WTO members would enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   It could also provoke retaliation from China, endangering U.S.
national security interests, the administration warns.
</P>
<P>
   As one example of what is at state, among those lobbying the
hardest for the bill is United Parcel Service. Its employees have
sent handwritten letters to wavering congressmen urging passage.
UPS now reaches 108 cities in China, but only as part of a joint
venture with a state-owned parcel delivery concern.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the trade legislation would enable UPS to operate on
its own, with drivers with familiar brown UPS uniforms. ''It would
allow us to run a company the way we think it should be run. We
could increase our brand presence,'' company spokesman Tad Segal
said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Flutist Jean-Pierre Rampal Dies  </HEADLINE>
By ANGELA DOLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Jean-Pierre Rampal, the world-renowned French
flutist whose sheer brilliance and richly hued playing propelled
the instrument back into the soloist spotlight, died in Paris on
Saturday of heart failure. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   Musicians and music lovers mourned the loss of a soloist,
conductor and teacher best known for his renderings of Baroque
masterpieces but who played everything from jazz to English folks
songs with tenderness and passion.
</P>
<P>
   When Rampal was young, the flute was often overlooked as a solo
instrument, as audiences preferred more well-known virtuoso works
for piano and violin. With Rampal in the spotlight, the flute
regained the prestige it enjoyed in 18th century, when works by
composers such as Bach highlighted the instrument's pure,
crystalline sonority.
</P>
<P>
   Violinist Isaac Stern, reached Saturday in Japan, said it was
Rampal's sheer musical brilliance that helped drive the public's
attention back to the flute.
</P>
<P>
   ''Working with him was pure pleasure, sheer joy, exuberance,''
Stern said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. ''He
was one of the great musicians of our time, who really changed the
world's perception of the flute as a solo instrument.''
</P>
<P>
   Rampal's trademarks were his gold flute and his joie de vivre.
</P>
<P>
   ''He played with such a rich palette of color in a way that few
people had done before and no one since,'' said flutist and
commentator Eugenia Zuckerman, who often worked with Rampal.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had an ability to imbue sound with texture and clarity and
emotional content. He was a dazzling virtuoso, but more than
anything he was a supreme poet,'' said Zuckerman, who was in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Rampal was a source of pride in France, a country with a rich
musical heritage but which has not produced many world-class
musicians this century.
</P>
<P>
   French President Jacques Chirac led the tributes, saying ''his
flute ... spoke to the heart. A light in the musical world has just
flickered out.''
</P>
<P>
   Rampal was born Jan. 7, 1922 in the southern port city of
Marseille, the son of a flutist who did not at first encourage his
son to become a professional musician. Rampal's parents hoped their
son would become a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   He became serious about music during World War II, after Nazi
occupying forces in France drafted him for labor in Germany. He
left medical school and went underground in Paris, where he studied
at the National Conservatory and attracted attention by winning the
school's famed competition in only five months.
</P>
<P>
   After the war ended, Rampal toured European capitals as a
soloist, chamber musician and orchestra member before settling back
in France as the principal flutist in the Paris Opera's orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   During a 50-year career, Rampal collaborated with other stars
such as cellist Mstislav Rostropovich and violinist Itzhak Perlman,
played with the Juilliard and Tokyo string quartets and inspired
countless young musicians to take up the flute.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had something called true talent,'' Stern, a friend for 50
years, told the AP. ''It's where you walk onstage and everybody
knows you're going to share a very happy time with them. His
admirers were adoring and constant.''
</P>
<P>
   Rampal's tours took him throughout the world, and he was
especially loved in North America, where he played recital tours
annually. Rampal and Pierre Boulez are the only classical musicians
to have had a hit on the Billboard chart for 10 consecutive years,
for Claude Bolling's ''Suite for Flute and Jazz Piano, No. 1,''
which they performed together.
</P>
<P>
   His record label, Sony, described him as perhaps the world's
most recorded classical musician.
</P>
<P>
   Rampal also gained recognition as a conductor and published an
autobiography, ''Music, My Love.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Francoise; two children, Isabelle
and Jean-Jacques; and five grandchildren. A funeral is scheduled
for Wednesday in Paris.

   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Justice Clarence Thomas says his public
speaking days are numbered.

   ''Every time we open our mouths, we come close to compromising
what we do,'' he told the Richmond Bar Association. Thomas said he
will reduce his speaking schedule and called Friday night's speech
something of ''a last hurrah for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to written questions from the audience, Thomas said
televising the Supreme Court's oral arguments is a bad idea.
''People act strange when a camera is on them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas also said he believes his colleagues ask too many
questions during oral arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ''The court was a fairly quiet court when I arrived'' in 1991,
he said. ''Now we look like 'The Family Feud.'''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said former President George Bush, who appointed him to
the court, recently asked him whether he would again go through the
bruising confirmation process, in which former associate Anita Hill
accused him of sexually harassing her.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes, in a heartbeat,'' Thomas said he told Bush. ''I thank God
that I have the opportunity to be there.''

<P>
   EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) -- Was it a compliment, or was dance
teacher Carol-Ann Stephenson carefully choosing her words when she
said Prince Charles has ''plenty of potential''?
</P>
<P>
   Stephenson partnered Charles in a merengue when the heir to the
throne visited the new DanceBase center on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a great pleasure to dance with the Prince of Wales. He
has natural rhythm,'' said Stephenson.
</P>
<P>
   ''I certainly enjoyed our dance, and I think he did as well. The
merengue is a very passionate, sensual dance and although he had
never tried it before he was picking up the moves very well,'' she
said. ''He has great potential.''

<HEADLINE> 24 Die as Turkey Boats Capsize  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Two overcrowded fishing boats capsized in
rough waters of the Black Sea on Saturday. At least 24 Turks
drowned, most of them women and children, local authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The boats had set sail from the coastal town of Besikduzu on a
cruise to mark a locally celebrated sea festivity, Gov. Adil Yazar
of the nearby port city Trabzon told private NTV television.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen people were injured and hospitalized in Trabzon. The
small boats had been overloaded, Anatolia news agency said. But it
was unclear how many people were aboard, or how many people the
boats could safely hold.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw a huge wave coming toward us, and I jumped into the
sea,'' an unidentified young man who was rescued by local
fishermen, told private CNN-Turk television.
</P>
<P>
   Another survivor, a pregnant woman named Yasemin Parlak, said
from a hospital bed: ''The boat was so crowded.'' She said she had
survived by holding onto the capsized boat. Her 8-month-old baby
also was hospitalized, but Parlak had no news about her husband and
friends who were on the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Local fishermen were still searching for survivors hours after
the accident, and a military helicopter from an eastern base
searched the waters from overhead.

<HEADLINE> MDs Reluctant To Break Bad News  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Terminally ill cancer patients rarely get a
straight answer when they ask doctors how long they have to live, a
new survey suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers found that doctors are likely to be overly
optimistic about their patients' outlooks or simply refuse to say.
Only about one-third are willing to give patients their best guess.
</P>
<P>
   The new research, presented Saturday at the opening of the
annual scientific meeting of the American Society for Clinical
Oncology, suggests that not only are doctors bad at making
predictions, but they are also uncomfortable passing the
information to the people they treat, at least when the message is
discouraging.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Elizabeth Lamont of the University of Chicago, one of the
researchers, said the doctors' lack of candor is probably
well-intentioned. They fear the truth may harm their patients,
perhaps by becoming a self-fulfilling prophesy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It shows a lot of caring and not malice,'' she said. ''They
are genuinely concerned about their patients, is my guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the doctors argue that honesty is probably better for
their patients than a well-meaning falsehood.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nicholas Christakis, a co-author of the study, noted that
many patients die in pain, institutionalized and broke.
</P>
<P>
   ''I firmly believe that a lot of these deficits could be
partially addressed if people had access to more reliable
prognostic information,'' he said. ''Part of the reason we die
badly is because we don't see death coming and we don't plan
accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Christakis said patients need reliable information so they can
get their finances in order, redo their wills, decide whether to
enter experimental drug studies or ask family members to take time
off from work to care for them.
</P>
<P>
   The study involved 258 doctors caring for 326 cancer patients
who were entering five Chicago hospices. When asked by the
researchers, nearly all the doctors were willing to estimate their
patients' survival time. But when asked what they would say if the
patients insisted on knowing these predictions, only about
one-third of the doctors said they would give a truthful answer.
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter said they would refuse to answer at all, saying
something like, ''Only God knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Another 40 percent said they would give an inaccurate estimate.
Nearly three-quarters of these doctors would sugarcoat the answer,
telling patients they will live longer than they really believe.
The rest would paint a picture even more grim than necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Christakis said there are many reasons to avoid a straight
answer, including the sheer unpleasantness of delivering bad news.
However, he said, many ''believe these will be self-fulfilling
prophesies, that bad news can contribute to bad outcomes.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Gradishar of Northwestern University, who was not
involved in the research, said the data ''suggest doctors tend to
be overly optimistic. It gets to the difficulty of breaking bad
news, although one would assume that news has already been broken
if people are going into hospices.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally, people are admitted to hospice care only if they have
six months or less to live. Christakis said the doctors'
unwillingness to be open with these patients suggests that in
everyday practice, they might be even less willing to tell the
truth than the survey suggests.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier report published in February in the British
Medical Journal, the doctors checked how accurate the doctors'
predictions actually turned out to be. It found they were usually
off target and on average assumed the patients would live five
times longer than they actually did.

<HEADLINE> Monitoring Cancer Care Explored  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Doctors are examining the possibility of
setting up a nationwide system to monitor the quality of cancer
care.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at the annual scientific meeting of the American Society
for Clinical Oncology said Saturday that a pilot study is getting
under way with 600 patients being treated for breast and colon
cancer in Los Angeles, Houston and Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers will review patient medical records to assess
the level of care given to each patient, including the kind of
treatment given and the extent of follow-up. Patients also will be
interviewed about their treatment experiences.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the project is to make sure cancer patients
everywhere get the highest quality of care, said Dr. Joseph S.
Bailes, president of the oncology society.
</P>
<P>
   The study will be overseen by doctors from the oncology society,
as well as patient advocates and other health experts, and it will
be conducted by researchers from Harvard University and the RAND
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The study is being financed with a $1 million grant from the
Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation. Doctors said it is a
response to a report from the Institute of Medicine last year that
recommended improving information about the quality of cancer care
nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Violent Clashes Reach West Bank  </HEADLINE>
By SAMAR ASSAD
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMALLAH, The West Bank (AP) -- Violent clashes throughout the
West Bank left dozens of Palestinians and two Israeli soldiers
injured Saturday -- a seventh straight day of fighting that
threatened to hold up the transfer of three Jerusalem-area villages
to Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's planned visit to the United
States this week was also up in the air amid the unrest.
</P>
<P>
   In towns around the Palestinian areas, thousands of
demonstrators threw stones at police and were met with a hail of
rubber bullets. More than 100 injuries were reported in all. Two
cameramen from the Reuters news agency were injured by rubber
bullets, one in the Gaza Strip and the other in the divided West
Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank town of Ramallah, clashes escalated after it
was announced that a Palestinian man who was shot in the head by
Israeli army gunfire on Friday had died. Doctors identified the
victim as 28-year-old Issa Abed, a cafeteria worker at nearby Bir
Zeit University.
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday evening, the shops and restaurants of Ramallah had
shut down as the town began an official mourning for Abed. His
death brought to four the number of Palestinians killed in a week
of clashes, including several gun battles, between Israelis and
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The violence comes as Israel and the Palestinians are working on
a final peace treaty to settle long-standing issues like the nature
of a Palestinian state, the future of Jerusalem and the fate of
Palestinian refugees. The Palestinians want to set up a state with
traditionally Arab east Jerusalem as the capital. They insist that
refugees who fled Israel when it was created in 1948 have the right
to return.
</P>
<P>
   The sides have set a September deadline for a final treaty, but
negotiations have progressed slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning last Sunday, Palestinians took to the streets to press
demands for the release of 1,650 prisoners held by Israel for
anti-Israeli attacks. On Monday, Palestinian police and civilian
activists of Arafat's party opened fire on Israeli soldiers.
Palestinian activists declared Friday and Saturday ''days of rage''
to draw attention to the prisoner issue.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has threatened to delay an upcoming Israeli withdrawal
from three West Bank villages next to Jerusalem if the violence is
not immediately curtailed. He has also said he might postpone his
trip to Washington, scheduled for Monday and Tuesday, if tensions
remain high in the Palestinian areas and along the Israeli-Lebanese
border.
</P>
<P>
   Barak called a last-minute security cabinet meeting for later
Saturday night to discuss the situation, Israel Television
reported. A statement released by Barak's office said he spoke by
phone this weekend with the leaders of Egypt, Jordan, and France
and told them Israel deplored the outbursts of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, that violence continued unabated. In Hebron, about
1,500 demonstrators marched toward an Israeli army checkpoint at
the entrance to the Israeli-controlled downtown area Saturday.
Palestinian police did not intervene. Standing on rooftops and
behind cement blocks, Israeli troops fired rubber bullets at
hundreds of stone throwers.
</P>
<P>
   Twirling a slingshot, Ahmed Qawasmeh, 22, said he has a brother
in jail and would do whatever he can to win his release.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were waiting for this moment to show our anger and our
disappointment over the peace process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Paramedics trying to evacuate one injured demonstrator dropped
him repeatedly to duck stones and rubber bullets. Another
Palestinian was about to throw a stone when he was hit in the chest
by a rubber bullet and fell to the ground. Three bystanders carried
him to an ambulance, one of six on standby at the scene. In all, 31
people were injured in Hebron, paramedics said.
</P>
<P>
   North of Hebron, a bus carrying Israeli Arabs was stoned by
Palestinians, the army said, injuring one passenger slightly.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank town of Nablus, medical officials said two
Palestinians were injured moderately by live bullets shot by
Israeli soldiers. The army said it was checking into the claims.
Four others were injured in Nablus by steel-coated rubber bullets,
including one man who was shot in the eye.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank town of Tulkarem, about 400 Palestinians threw
stones at Israeli soldiers guarding a crossing point into Israel. A
phalanx of six Israeli jeeps tried to hold the crowd at bay. About
two dozen young men took cover behind barrels just 20 yards from
the Israeli soldiers, lunging forward from time to time to throw
stones. Thirty Palestinians were hurt, medical officials said.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli soldier was injured slightly by stones in Tulkarem
and a second soldier suffered slight injuries near Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the West Bank, 22 Palestinians were injured in
clashes in the town of Ramallah and 20 in the town of Jenin,
according to the officials. Almost all the injuries were from
steel-coated rubber bullets.
</P>
<P>
   In the Gaza Strip, hundreds of Palestinian police tried to keep
stone-throwers away from an isolated Israeli army post near the
Jewish settlement of Netzarim. At first Palestinian police moved
aggressively, tackling stone-throwers, bundling them into pickup
trucks and driving them away. However, most of the demonstrators
made their way back to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   At least six injuries were reported.

<HEADLINE> Reformists Win Most Seats in Iran  </HEADLINE>
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- A council dominated by hard-liners endorsed
long-delayed legislative election results from Tehran on Saturday,
giving top allies of Iran's reformist president 26 of 30 seats in
the city -- and assuring reformers control of parliament for the
first time since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the winners in Tehran, the capital, are key backers of
reforms that include easing strict Islamic law and improving ties
with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The election for Iran's parliament, or Majlis, was held Feb. 18.
Reformist candidates won an overwhelming victory in Tehran, but the
Guardian Council -- the supervisory body dominated by hard-liners --
had been holding the results up with allegations of widespread
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, though, the Guardian Council endorsed the Tehran
results, making final the victories by 26 allies of President
Mohammad Khatami, according to results broadcast by Tehran radio.
The 12-man council awarded two seats to hard-liners, including one
to former President Hashemi Rafsanjani, and annulled results for
two others that will be re-contested at an unspecified date.
</P>
<P>
   The move came two days after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, the final authority in Iran, said the results should not
be delayed any longer. Khamenei, who normally sides with the
hard-liners, asked the council to stop a re-count and invalidate
votes in all ballot boxes where discrepancies had been discovered.
</P>
<P>
   The new 290-seat parliament, elected in February, opens May 28
and will feature a solid reformist majority. Hard-liners control no
more than 70 seats, while the reformers also had won 120 seats
outside Tehran in the first round of elections and between 47 and
52 seats in run-off elections last month. All run-off results have
not yet been ratified.
</P>
<P>
   Losing control of the parliament is a severe blow to
hard-liners. The parliament can pass laws granting greater media
freedom and order investigations into the affairs of leading
hard-liners who had never been answerable to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Still, hard-liners dominate the judiciary, military and
broadcast media, leaving them enough power to stall the president's
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's results provided the first good news in months for
reformers, who have been battered by a hard-line crackdown aimed at
rolling back the popular reforms initiated by Khatami since he took
office in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-liners maintain that Khatami's attempts to loosen the
social, political and cultural restrictions dictated by Iran's
Islamic laws go against the ideals of the revolution that brought
the clergy to power. Over the past month, 18 reformist newspapers
have been ordered shut by the hard-line judiciary. Several leading
reformers have been arrested and jailed.
</P>
<P>
   The managing directors of 17 newspapers, some of which have been
closed down, were summoned Saturday to appear in a press court
because of unspecified complaints lodged against them, state-run
media reported. Most were with reformist papers, though some from
conservative ones also were called.
</P>
<P>
   Also Saturday, the press court that implemented the ban on
reformist publications ordered the detention of a presidential
confidant. Saeed Pourazizi, who began publishing the pro-democracy
Bahar earlier this month, was allowed free on $50,000 bail, editors
at his newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The hard-liners are willing to do anything to prevent some of
the most prominent reformists from taking their legitimate seats in
parliament. They could turn to other ways now, like bringing up old
court cases that they had filed against leading reformists,'' said
Ahmad Zeidabadi, a political analyst and columnist for some of the
papers that hard-liners closed.
</P>
<P>
   In the Tehran voting, Mohammad-Reza Khatami, the president's
brother and a leading reformer, won the most votes. Coming in
second was Jamileh Kadivar, wife of the culture minister, Ataollah
Mohajerani. Both support greater press freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the new reformist lawmakers from Tehran back the idea of
improving relations with the United States. One, Ali-Reza Nouri,
called before the election for a national referendum on whether
Iran should restore ties with Washington. He ended up as the
third-highest vote-getter in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-Iranian relations collapsed after the 1979 Islamic
revolution and a student takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran
later that year. Fifty-two Americans were held hostage for more
than a year. The deep freeze began to thaw only slightly after
Khatami's election.

<HEADLINE> U.S.-Iraq Dispute Threatens Treaty  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United States and Iraq came under
intense pressure Saturday to settle ''the last words'' in a dispute
that is blocking agreement on a new nuclear arms agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the delegates from 187 countries who have spent four
weeks reviewing the global treaty controlling the spread of nuclear
weapons were determined not to leave the conference at U.N.
headquarters without consensus on the final document.
</P>
<P>
   ''The world will not understand if this conference fails on this
issue,'' said Chris Sanders, the Netherlands' disarmament
ambassador in Geneva. ''We will never be able to explain.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference president, Algerian U.N. Ambassador Abdallah
Baali, asked Canadian Ambassador Chris Westdal, who had worked
through the night, to continue trying to get an agreement between
the United States and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Signaling the importance Washington placed on the issue, U.S.
Assistant Secretary of State Robert Einhorn, who is in charge of
nonproliferation, flew to New York and took charge of the U.S.
negotiations, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   The conference to review implementation of the Nuclear
Nonproliferation Treaty was scheduled to end Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Saying ''significant progress'' had been made, Westdal told
delegates late Saturday morning that ''key parties are actively
engaged in good faith negotiations of the last words of key text.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute centered on Iraq's compliance with U.N. Security
Council resolutions placing Iraq under sanctions until its nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons were eliminated. The United States
maintains that Iraq has not adequately accounted for its weapons
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's U.N. Ambassador Saeed Hasan said Baghdad would accept an
account of the International Atomic Energy Agency's January
inspection of its nuclear reactors in the text of the treaty -- but
was vehemently opposed to any mention of Security Council
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Americans want to include that this inspection does not
substitute for the obligations of Iraq under Security Council
resolutions,'' Hasan said Friday night. ''We rejected that
proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   At Saturday's meeting, Mexico's disarmament ambassador in
Geneva, Antonio de Icaza, speaking on behalf of a coalition of
non-nuclear states that played a key role in drafting the new
agenda, urged the United States and Iraq ''to go that extra mile.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference operates on the rule of consensus -- which means
any of the 187 parties to the nonproliferation treaty can block
final agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, we are in a situation, due to the rules of
procedure, of gaining all or losing all,'' he said. ''Losing all is
just not acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   In a breakthrough Thursday, the five nuclear powers agreed to
''an unequivocal undertaking'' to totally eliminate their nuclear
arsenals, a decision praised by several non-nuclear countries as an
important step toward nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the agreement gave no timetable, and delegates said
it would take many years to achieve a nuclear-free world, it was
the first time the nuclear powers stated their obligation to total
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   The nuclear haves and have-nots also agreed on other steps: a
moratorium on nuclear weapon test explosions pending a
Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, further reductions on
tactical nuclear weapons, increased transparency of information
about nuclear arsenals, reductions in ''the operational status'' of
nuclear weapons, and a diminishing of their role in national
security policies.
</P>
<P>
   The nonproliferation treaty, which went into force in 1970,
represented a bargain between those with nuclear weapons and those
without. In return for a pledge from non-nuclear states not to
acquire nuclear weapons, the treaty committed nuclear-weapon states
to pursuing disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates stressed the importance of getting the four holdouts
to sign the treaty -- India and Pakistan which conducted rival
nuclear tests in 1998, Israel which is believed to have nuclear
weapons, and Cuba.

hundreds of stone throwers.
</P>
<P>
   Twirling a slingshot, Ahmed Qawasmeh, 22, said he has a brother
in jail and would do whatever he can to win his release.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were waiting for this moment to show our anger and our
disappointment over the peace process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Paramedics trying to evacuate one injured demonstrator dropped
him repeatedly to duck stones and rubber bullets. Another
Palestinian was about to throw a stone when he was hit in the chest
by a rubber bullet and fell to the ground. Three bystanders carried
him to an ambulance, one of six on standby at the scene. In all, 31
people were injured in Hebron, paramedics said.
</P>
<P>
   North of Hebron, a bus carrying Israeli Arabs was stoned by
Palestinians, the army said, injuring one passenger slightly.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank town of Nablus, medical officials said two
Palestinians were injured moderately by live bullets shot by
Israeli soldiers. The army said it was checking into the claims.
Four others were injured in Nablus by rubber bullets, including one
man who was shot in the eye.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank town of Tulkarem, about 400 Palestinians threw
stones at Israeli soldiers guarding a crossing point into Israel. A
phalanx of six Israeli jeeps tried to hold the crowd at bay. About
two dozen young men took cover behind barrels just 20 yards from
the Israeli soldiers, lunging forward from time to time to throw
stones. Thirty Palestinians were hurt, medical officials said.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli soldier was injured slightly by stones in Tulkarem
and a second soldier suffered slight injuries near Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the West Bank, 22 Palestinians were injured in
clashes in the town of Ramallah and 20 in the town of Jenin,
according to the officials. Almost all the injuries were from
rubber bullets.
</P>
<P>
   In the Gaza Strip, hundreds of Palestinian police tried to keep
stone-throwers away from an isolated Israeli army post near the
Jewish settlement of Netzarim. At first Palestinian police moved
aggressively, tackling stone-throwers, bundling them into pickup
trucks and driving them away. However, most of the demonstrators
made their way back to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   At least six injuries were reported.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Scraps TV China Trade Pitch  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton canceled a nationally
televised speech on behalf of China trade legislation after being
told by congressional Democrats that such a high-profile appeal
actually could cost him support on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ''We became convinced it would be better to keep the decibel
level low and to work with our undecided members one on one instead
of using the megaphone of television,'' said Tom Keaney, a top aide
to Rep. Robert Matsui, D-Calif., the Democrats' chief vote-counter
on the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The president abruptly scrapped Sunday night's five-minute Oval
Office address while he was on a political fund-raising trip to
Philadelphia and Chicago on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We indicated to the White House that a speech at this point
would do more harm than good,'' Keaney said in an interview
Saturday. ''We wanted to keep the noise down. We just felt a speech
would be counterproductive.''
</P>
<P>
   Added White House spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri: ''They've
advised us that they don't think that the Oval Office address is
the most productive way to get votes.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House said Clinton planned to place calls to House
members over the weekend to try to enlist support.
</P>
<P>
   The House is expected to vote late Wednesday or on Thursday.
Supporters are claiming momentum and believe they are close to the
218 votes needed for passage. But lawmakers on both sides agreed
the vote could be very close.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would open China's markets to more U.S. goods, and end
20 years of annual reviews of China's trade status. The bill is
supported by the business community and opposed by labor,
environmental and some veterans' groups.
</P>
<P>
   Neither ABC nor CBS planned a live broadcast of the speech. ABC
said the network had covered both sides of the issue on its news
programs, and CBS said the address amounted to lobbying. NBC, CNN
and Fox planned to carry it live.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bills are H.R. 4444 and S. 2277

<HEADLINE> Relatives Remember WWII Sub Victims  </HEADLINE>
By ELENA BECATOROS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAVRATA, Greece (AP) -- A lone bugler played and laurel wreaths
floated over the resting place of a sunken British World War II
submarine as relatives gathered at the spot for the first time
Saturday to pay homage to 60 seamen who perished there almost six
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Only one man managed to surface alive from the Ionian Sea depths
in December 1941 after a mine explosion ripped through the H.M.S.
Perseus and sunk the sub. The Perseus lay undisturbed until it was
found by Greek divers two years ago off the coast of Mavrata, a
small village about 120 miles northwest of Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives wept as they tossed simple tributes into the sea:
wreaths with notes pinned to them and bottles holding letters. The
bugler ended two minutes of silence with the military score Last
Post.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the most wonderful experience that I've ever had, to pay
tribute to my father and say good-bye,'' said Cynthia Neave, of
Sydney, Australia, daughter of the submarine's captain, Lt. Cmdr.
Edward Nicolay. ''It's the first time I've ever really been able to
cry for my father.''
</P>
<P>
   The Perseus struck a mine and sank on Dec. 9, 1941, while on
patrol off the coast. It lies, tilted slightly on its starboard
side, at a depth of 171 feet. Fifty-nine British seamen and one
Greek officer died.
</P>
<P>
   Stoker John Capes, the only survivor, managed to swim to shore,
where islanders hid him from Italian and later Nazi troops for 18
months before smuggling him to Turkey and freedom. Capes died a
decade ago. But his daughter, Julie Knappett, was in Greece to meet
those he served with and some of the islanders who sheltered him.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I leave here, it's like having to lay my father to rest
again,'' said Knappett, of Suffolk, England. ''Because it's like
the other relatives and those who helped him have resurrected him
again.''
</P>
<P>
   There had always been suspicion about Capes' story -- until Greek
diver Kostas Thoctarides found evidence to back up his claims.
</P>
<P>
   Capes had described how he used an escape mechanism to flood his
compartment and equalize the pressure as the submarine settled on
the seabed. Divers found the hatch open and the bottle of rum that
Capes said he used to boost his courage, along with about three
other stokers who survived the initial explosion.
</P>
<P>
   But it seems the others never managed to leave the compartment.
Thoctarides said he saw human bones, an empty boiler suit and three
boots, indicating at least two people had died there.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 relatives, as well as representatives of the Royal Navy
and the Submariners Association, traveled from Britain and
Australia for the memorial services that began Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would have gone to the other side of the world for this,''
wept Marienne Haynes, whose brother Claud Francis, 24, died on the
Perseus. ''I could never have missed it.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Embassy in Eritrea on Alert  </HEADLINE>
By CRAIG NELSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) -- The United States set in motion a partial
evacuation of its embassy here Saturday -- a move that some feared
could be the start of a general foreign pullout from Eritrea's
anxious capital as troops from neighboring Ethiopia advance on the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia, pushing to end its two-year-old border war with
Eritrea, claimed to have moved within 60 miles of Asmara. Scattered
charred corpses of Eritrean soldiers and debris of twisted tanks,
spent shells and discarded ammunition lined the routes of the
Ethiopian forces' eight-day-old onslaught. Ethiopia said Eritrean
troops were blowing up bridges to try to slow the advance.
</P>
<P>
   The United States chartered a plane expected to arrive Sunday
for the State Department-ordered evacuation of nonessential embassy
staff and their dependents. Officials encouraged private American
citizens to take the plane out as well.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of expatriates are expected to board the flight. Twelve
embassy workers will remain in the capital, embassy spokeswoman
Collette Christian said.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department called for the partial evacuation late
Friday, citing deteriorating security. It is the third time since
the Ethiopian-Eritrean war erupted in May 1998 that nonessential
staff have been withdrawn from the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Because of U.S. influence internationally, the decision has an
impact far beyond the number of evacuees. Relief agencies feared it
would trigger an exodus of aid workers, imperiling desperately
needed aid projects and -- with hundreds of thousands of hungry
Eritreans fleeing the fighting -- even further endangering lives.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats feared other governments would follow
Washington's suit, deepening the sense of international isolation
Eritrea has repeatedly expressed since the invasion began. Eritrean
Presidential spokesman Yemane Gebremeskel insisted that Asmara was
not in danger and accused the U.S. government of failing to speak
out strongly since Ethiopian forces stormed Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
   ''The lack of a strong U.S. condemnation of the Ethiopian
invasion is disappointing and inexplicable,'' Gebremeskel said.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopian troops, artillery and warplanes opened their offensive
May 12, quickly retaking a piece of disputed territory Eritrea
seized in May 1998. Ethiopia denies any intention of taking over
recognized Eritrean territory but has given no sign of stopping its
two-pronged offensive from the north and south.
</P>
<P>
   In military moves Saturday, Ethiopia said its warplanes bombed a
missile base south of Asmara and attacked a major military compound
in the west for a second day.
</P>
<P>
   The wreckage of battle and the smell of rotting corpses lined
the road from the Ethiopian border to the southern town of Barentu,
a key post captured Wednesday by Ethiopia. Most of the dead in the
fighting apparently have been buried quickly, in keeping with the
Muslim and local Christian tradition.
</P>
<P>
   At one spot, corpses and parts of corpses surrounded a mauled
Eritrean troop truck that appeared to have taken a direct hit from
a rocket. The burned hands and feet of Eritrean casualties
protruded from a churned patch of bulldozed earth.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia claimed some Eritrean soldiers were retreating into
neighboring Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of the estimated 550,000 Eritreans uprooted by the
fighting also are seeking refuge across the Sudanese border. Most
are women and children, ''streaming in by foot, by donkey and by
truck,'' Lindsey Davies of the U.N. World Food Program said
Saturday. Aid agencies estimated 12,250 had fled into Sudan at
three crossings in recent days, Davies said in the Kenyan capital,
Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   Christian said no Americans in Asmara were in imminent danger.
Still, she said, ''It would be imprudent to wait longer to get
nonessential staff out.'' There are roughly 300 U.S. citizens and
green-card holders in Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
   Germany and the Netherlands also have encouraged their citizens
to leave, and Germany was readying contingency plans to evacuate
its embassy.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Catholics Get New Saints  </HEADLINE>
By JO TUCKMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- For more than a century, Mexico has made do
with just one national saint. But that's about to change: On
Sunday, Pope John Paul II is due to canonize 27 more for the
world's second-largest Roman Catholic country after Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is very important for national pride,'' said historian Jean
Meyer, who has specialized in religion in Mexico. ''It's an
international boost that strokes the Mexican collective ego, rather
like winning the soccer World Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   The new saints, like many sporting idols, have their
controversial sides. All but two died during repression of
religious fervor by vehemently anti-clerical governments in the
1920s and 30s. The state-church conflict reached its height when an
armed religious uprising sparked the 1926-29 Cristero War.
</P>
<P>
   The best known of the 25 martyrs is Father Cristobal Magallanes,
who reputedly pardoned his killers as he died by firing squad May
25, 1927. The most famous priest from that era, Father Miguel Pro,
is not on the list, apparently still too controversial a figure due
to his alleged part in the violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''The new saints didn't participate in the war itself, but they
provided spiritual guidance for the people, defending the faith and
the presence of Christ the King in Mexico,'' said the Rev. Rolando
Rivera, a priest at the Guadalupe Basilica in Mexico City. ''Now
history, and the church itself, are giving them their just
recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   The saint-making process has taken a collective form, with the
25 Cristero martyrs sharing the credit for miraculously curing a
woman of cysts in her breasts in 1993. Carmen Pullido fully
recovered after invoking all the martyrs while wearing a hollow
silver cross containing relics of Magallanes, the Rev. Adalberto
Gonzalez said in a telephone interview from Pullido's diocese in
the eastern state of Guadalajara.
</P>
<P>
   Also being canonized are the founders of two religious
organizations: Maria de Jesus Sacramentado Venegas of the
Congregation of the Sacred Heart and Jose Yermo y Parres of the
Congregation of the Servants of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and of
the Poor.
</P>
<P>
   Although Rivera conceded that a 1992 reform of Mexico's 1917
constitution removed the most draconian restrictions on religious
activity, he said the Mexican state remains suspicious of open
religiosity.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no longer persecution, but there is aversion,'' he
said, citing what he called biased teaching regarding the Cristero
War in public schools. He said the canonization will not only help
put the record straight, but also will aid the Mexican church's
drive to reinforce Roman Catholic traditions in the face of modern
secular culture and competing evangelical religions.
</P>
<P>
   The new saints ''will be friends in heaven who help mediate the
relationship with Christ, and it is always good to have friends,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's only saint until now has been San Felipe de Jesus, a
Mexican monk who was crucified in Nagasaki, Japan, when his ship
stopped over there in a storm. Pius IX canonized him in 1862.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer said Pope John Paul II's decision to make so many new
Mexican saints follows a similar logic as part of a global strategy
to promote the church's growth in Latin America, Asia and Africa --
parts of the world where he said people still value mystery in
worship, a quality largely lost in the rarified intellectual
atmosphere of Christianity's traditional European heartland.
</P>
<P>
   ''In his desire to resuscitate popular forms of worship, this
man has made hundreds of new saints, and that hasn't been done for
centuries,'' said Meyer, who wrote the most-respected history of
Mexico's religious conflict of the 1920s. ''The pope is modifying
the geography of the saints.''

<HEADLINE> Harlem residents pleased that Giuliani is out of the race  </HEADLINE>
By LUKAS I. ALPERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani reincarnated as a
softhearted, sensitive guy?
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is convinced.
</P>
<P>
   A day after a newly introspective Giuliani dropped his Senate
bid, some black and Hispanic New Yorkers cheered the withdrawal and
questioned the sincerity of the mayor's promise to try to heal the
city's racial divides.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hallelujah!'' shouted one man at a Harlem rally led by the
Rev. Al Sharpton. ''Hallelujah!''
</P>
<P>
   His exuberance spoke volumes about the tension that has long
characterized the combative mayor's relationships with many of the
city's minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't wish ill health on anybody, but I will not forget the
tears that you ignored,'' Sharpton said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's emotional announcement that prostate cancer would
force him to forego the race against first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton included some reflections on his strained relations with
many black and Hispanic New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would consider changing the way he approached some
issues and spoke of overcoming ''barriers that maybe I placed
there. ... I'm going to try to reach out to more people, and to try
and help more people.''
</P>
<P>
   At a town hall meeting the night before he dropped out, Giuliani
said he regretted the way he'd handled the police shooting of
Patrick Dorismond, an unarmed black man. Giuliani was widely
criticized for releasing Dorismond's sealed juvenile police record
to the public.
</P>
<P>
   He said he'd done right in releasing the records, but admitted
he should have been more understanding with regard to the loss of a
person's life.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton said the apology didn't go far enough, and Dorismond's
sister, Maria Dorismond, said, ''It's too late, don't come to us
with this story.''
</P>
<P>
   Some were more willing to temper their ill feelings toward
Giuliani in light of his cancer diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course I feel bad for him, but what goes around comes
around. You ever hear of karma?'' said Joseph Taylor, 22, as he
rushed to get out of the rain on 125th Street.
</P>
<P>
   But others could not put aside their anger.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel like I should feel bad for him, but what kind of
compassion has he ever shown,'' said Michaela Harrison, a New York
University graduate student, while leaving the subway station at
St. Nicholas Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel (D-Harlem), on the other hand, said
that while he thinks the mayor did the right thing in dropping out,
he wishes him well.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton noted that since Giuliani was no longer in the race,
Clinton could no longer expect the voting landscape to remain the
same and warned that the mayor's absence from the race means she
can no longer take the votes of anti-Giuliani minorities for
granted.
</P>
<P>
   ''I predict that had Giuliani stayed in the race there would
have been a record turnout of blacks and Latinos to vote against
him. ... Now that he is removed, Mrs. Clinton has to give us a
reason to come out to vote for her,'' Sharpton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mrs. Clinton ought to take this as a signal not to ignore our
community,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Chernobyl Turbo-Generator Back On  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- Operators at Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear
power plant on Saturday powered up a turbo-generator that
malfunctioned and had to be switched off, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Chernobyl's electricity output was halved after problems in the
turbo-generator were detected Monday. The device was fixed and put
back online Saturday morning, a duty officer at Chernobyl said.
</P>
<P>
   The Interfax news agency said Chernobyl, site of the world's
worst nuclear accident in 1986, would generate only 80 percent of
its normal electricity output until officials made sure that
French-made safety valves installed last year were functioning
properly.
</P>
<P>
   The valves have been the cause of several malfunctions and
shutdowns at Chernobyl, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The turbo-generator malfunction this week was surrounded by
reports and rumors of a more serious accident, as well as of forest
fires around the plant that were contaminated with radiation in the
1986 accident. Emergency officials and Chernobyl workers denied the
reports.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Rebels Release Some Hostages  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Rebels holding Fiji's elected government
released 10 hostages Sunday after they signed documents backing an
attempted coup leader, local radio reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had to sign the conditions, it was a condition of our
release,'' said John Ali, one of the government members released.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji's Radio 96 reported that 10 members of Prime Minister
Mahendra Chaudhry's government were released in two groups by the
rebels led by businessman George Speight. About 50 people were
captured in Friday's uprising, which Speight said was on behalf of
indigenous Fijians against a government led by Fijians of Indian
origin.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhry, who was not one of those released, earlier collapsed
inside the Parliament House complex. Local media reported that
Chaudhry's collapse was stress-related, and that he later recovered
and was resting. Speight told local reporters inside parliament
that a doctor would be allowed to see Chaudhry later Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Local radio also reported that a shot was fired inside the
parliament complex early Sunday, prompting Speight to order all
lights in the complex turned off. Speight later said the shot was
accidentally fired by one of his own men, radio reported.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the members of Chaudhry's coalition government who were
released Sunday were indiginous Fijians, local radio reported.
</P>
<P>
   The coup attempt appeared headed for failure Saturday as
military, police and influential Fijian leaders lined up behind
Chaudhry's democratically elected government and the president.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an action myself and my group are willing to risk our
lives for,'' said Speight, barefoot and dressed in a traditional
sulu skirt, talking through the gate to international media for the
first time Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Speight said he had appointed a new president using executive
powers assumed in the coup.
</P>
<P>
   For months, ethnic tensions have been building between
indigenous Fijians and the descendants of Indian migrants, who
dominate commerce in this Pacific Ocean country 2,250 miles
northeast of Sydney, Australia. Indians make up about 44 percent of
Fiji's population of 813,000 while indigenous Fijians account for
51 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Before Speight talked to the media, President Ratu Sir Kamisese
Mara said he would use ''all the authority and resources at my
command'' to end the standoff.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government will go to great lengths to avoid a violent
confrontation,'' Mara said. ''But we will not bow down to threats
and coercion. The perpetrators should not underestimate my
unshakable determination to maintain the integrity and stability of
the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside parliament, Tupeni Baba, deputy prime minister and a
hostage along with Chaudhry, issued a statement pleading with the
military not to storm the building.
</P>
<P>
   ''We understand the president has asked the army to intervene,''
Baba said. ''This scenario would mean that if shooting takes place,
we must expect the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka -- himself the leader of
two coups in 1987 -- was engaged in shuttle diplomacy between the
president's residence and parliament. He urged Speight's group to
surrender.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in an interview with local television, he said Speight's
actions were, ''treason, there is no other way to look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Radio Fiji, which has a reporter inside parliament, said
Speight's men threatened to shoot hostages if attacked. The station
later said rebels had held a gun to Chaudhry's head and threatened
to execute him. Chaudhry was reportedly badly beaten by his
captors.
</P>
<P>
   Speight denied harming or mishandling any hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhry's election came under a revamped constitution that
largely removed clauses that discriminated against ethnic Indians,
originally brought to Fiji as laborers on sugar plantations.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji media reported that Fijians of Indian ancestry were taking
to the streets in a show of support for Chaudhry's administration.
</P>
<P>
   The nationalist Taukei Movement on Saturday called on Fijians to
march to parliament in a show of support for Speight, but the call
was largely ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's raid coincided with a march through Suva of Taukei
Movement supporters, which erupted into hours of rioting when news
of the hostage-taking broke. Markets were torched, store windows
shattered and shops looted, mostly Indian-owned.
</P>
<P>
   Police estimated the damage at $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whole families were stealing goods -- mothers, fathers and
young children,'' said Dirbkant Lala as he surveyed the wreckage of
his kitchenware shop. ''They were laughing. They called it family
shopping.''

By TIM SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Sierra Leone's government said
Saturday it would not bow to pressure and release rebel chief Foday
Sankoh, even though his fighters are holding 334 U.N. peacekeepers
hostage.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have reportedly demanded freedom for Sankoh, who was
seized Wednesday and is in government custody at an undisclosed
location.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas have not linked his release to the freedom of the
U.N. captives. However, they have stopped freeing peacekeepers at
their jungle bases. In recent days, they had allowed some groups to
walk to neighboring Liberia.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Sankoh might be released in a bid to end Sierra Leone's
renewed conflict, Information Minister Julius Spencer said: ''it's
out of the question. It's not possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh, widely reviled for his role in the country's brutal
civil war, was captured as he walked toward his Freetown home. He
had fled his home May 8 after his fighters fired on a crowd of
demonstrators, killing 19.
</P>
<P>
   The government has yet to say what will happen to the rebel
chief, whose Revolutionary United Front rebels reopened their fight
against the government in recent weeks, undermining a fragile peace
accord signed last July.
</P>
<P>
   Under the peace accord, the rebels were given an amnesty and
Sankoh received a spot in the government. However, the amnesty does
not cover acts committed since the agreement was signed in July.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Sankoh would face trial, as many Sierra Leoneans are
demanding, Spencer said: ''The incidents are being investigated to
determine whether charges should be filed.''
</P>
<P>
   In another development, seven peacekeepers from Kenya were
missing after being encircled by rebels, according to a Kenyan
newspaper report.
</P>
<P>
   A group of 10 Kenyans ''attempted to break out of the
encirclement, (and their) armored vehicle slipped into a raging
river,'' Kenyan Gen. Daudi Tonje was quoted as saying in the East
Africa Standard newspaper. Three managed to swim to safety, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst in Sierra Leone said only that
there were ''unconfirmed reports'' that a number of peacekeepers
had died. The U.N. had previously announced the deaths of two of
its soldiers out of a contingent that now numbers 10,400 -- the
largest U.N. peacekeeping deployment in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The recent clashes between pro-government forces and the rebels
have forced thousands of villagers to flee their homes and could
disrupt food supplies, the U.N.'s World Food Program said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, U.S. envoy Jesse Jackson denounced the ''terror
tactics'' of the rebels and called on them to immediately release
the U.N. peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The RUF must disarm voluntarily, and immediately, or be made
to disarm involuntarily,'' Jackson said Saturday at a press
conference in neighboring Liberia.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, acting as President Clinton's special envoy, is touring
West Africa in a bid to calm tensions in Sierra Leone and win the
freedom of the peacekeepers. The rebels seized about 500
peacekeepers earlier this month, and are still holding the majority
of them at their jungle bases in eastern Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said Saturday that he had not yet decided whether he
would go to Sierra Leone. He planned to travel to Mali and Guinea
over the weekend.

<HEADLINE> Tony Blair's Wife Gives Birth  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BARR
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair plans to combine
fatherhood and politics as he shares responsibility for raising his
son Leo, born early Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The boy is the first child born to a serving British prime
minister in 152 years. Cherie Blair, 45, and the 6 pound, 12 ounce
baby -- named after Blair's father -- were in good health.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's gorgeous, he's a lovely little kid,'' said Blair, 46.
''He's been pretty good so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair's baby is the couple's fourth child. Congratulations
poured in from Queen Elizabeth II, political leaders and a friend
across the Atlantic -- Hillary Clinton, who telephoned Mrs. Blair in
the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a wonderful day for them and a happy day for the
country as a whole,'' Conservative Party leader William Hague said.
</P>
<P>
   Blair, whose government legislated to give fathers a right to
parental leave, resisted public pressure -- notably from his lawyer
wife, who has taken such cases to court -- to claim that right for
himself. Blair indicated Saturday that he plans to cut down his
workload for a while, but won't take a leave.
</P>
<P>
   While Blair was at the hospital Friday night supporting his wife
through the birth, Labor Party lawmaker Tess Kingham -- a new mother
-- said she was fed up with the demands of politics and would not
run for re-election. But Kingham said her decision was not based on
the twins she had in January.
</P>
<P>
   Kingham was swept into office in the Labor landslide of 1997 --
one of a record 120 women elected to Parliament, 102 of them from
the Labor Party. But any expectations that the influx of women
legislators would lead to changes in the style and working
practices of the House of Commons proved largely unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not want to work in a gentleman's club,'' Kingham told
party members in Gloucester, in western England. ''The practices
and culture of Parliament are suited to a 19th century institution,
when well-heeled men did a day job and then popped along to the
Commons to do a bit of politics in the evening and enjoy the many
restaurants and bars with their chums.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not willing to sit up all night for schoolboy politics,''
she said. ''At the whim of three or four of the opposition, we can
be kept there until 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. as they talk out a debate,
usually saying nothing of consequence and sometimes with no vote at
the end of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Labor lawmaker Peter Bradley, also elected in 1997, said it
isn't just women who are calling for reform of the House of
Commons.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a ridiculous parody of a parliament, weighed down by
traditions which few respect, stifled by rituals which even fewer
understand and strangled by working practices which mean that
exhausted MPs pass laws at 3 in the morning when they are past
caring what they are voting for,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone shares those opinions, though. Conservative
lawmaker Gerald Howarth replied Saturday that if Margaret Thatcher
''could combine motherhood and having young children with the most
distinguished career in the House of Commons then clearly it's
possible to do both.''
</P>
<P>
   ''But it's not for the fainthearted and it would be quite
inappropriate for us to change our habits for a very small number
of people,'' Howarth said.

<HEADLINE> Italian Tenor Valletti Dies at 79  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Cesare Valletti, an Italian tenor renowned for his
interpretations of Mozart's operas, has died in Italy at age 79,
family friends said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Valletti hadn't performed for decades. He gave up his career in
1967 because of health problems, said the Genoa newspaper Il Secolo
XIX.
</P>
<P>
   The paper reported that Valletti died of a heart attack May 14
while he was staying in the Genoa suburb of Nervi. A friend in
Rome, Dinella Vitale, said a funeral and memorial services were
held a few days after the death in Milan, where the tenor lived.
</P>
<P>
   Largely forgotten in recent years, Valletti made his debut in
Bari in 1947 as Alfredo in ''La Traviata'' and went on to
engagements at Milan's La Scala and New York's Metropolitan. His
career peaked in the 1950s. In 1953, he sang with Maria Callas in
London. Critics described his voice as possessing rare purity.
</P>
<P>
   Valletti and his wife, Nicoletta Braibanti, had no children.

<HEADLINE> GOP Senator Blocks U.N. Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a foreign policy dispute with the Clinton
administration, a Republican senator who oversees State Department
spending is blocking the government from paying $368 million owed
to the United Nations for four peacekeeping missions.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., believes it is unfair for U.S.
taxpayers to pay for part of the U.N. operations in Congo, Kosovo,
East Timor and Sierra Leone, a spokesman said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The money originally was intended for other purposes by the
State Department, but later was set aside to help pay for the
peacekeeping efforts and therefore required Gregg's approval,
Edmund Amorosi said.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg, chairman of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee that
handles spending for the Commerce, Justice and State departments,
has said he would keep the money on hold until, at the least, the
situation in Sierra Leone had changed.
</P>
<P>
   The White House on Saturday referred questions about Gregg's
move to the State Department. A State Department spokeswoman
declined to address Gregg's action, instead citing remarks
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright made last week.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech Wednesday at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, she said
that ''legislators who are denying funds for U.N. missions in
Kosovo, East Timor, the Congo and Sierra Leone are making a grave
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Troublemakers in these regions cannot simply be wished away,
they must be contained, captured, convicted or converted which, in
every case, requires resources,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg's spokesman said the senator ''feels the United States
needs to be engaged in world affairs, but these particular
instances, he disagrees with the Clinton administration's policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Amorosi cited Sierra Leone specifically as a peacekeeping effort
''gone awry.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 330 U.N. peacekeepers in Sierra Leone, which has been
torn apart by civil war, have been held hostage by rebel leaders
for nearly three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg is angry about the Clinton administration's role in
encouraging a peace agreement signed in July that gave amnesty and
a share or power to the rebel leader Foday Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh's rebels have been accused of the rape, murder and
mutilation of thousands of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   As an alternative, Gregg said he soon hoped to see the
establishment of a war crimes tribunal similar to what was set up
in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The move is the latest in a tiff between Republicans and the
Clinton administration over the United States' role in
international peacekeeping operations. Of late, senators from both
parties have been voicing concern over America's role in overseas
peacekeeping efforts, specifically Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. John Warner, R-Va. and Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., had drawn up
a measure which proposed the establishment of a deadline for the
removal of U.S. troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   It was narrowly defeated by the Senate on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Two Montclair teens accused of buying guns online  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MONTCLAIR, N.J. (AP) -- Two teen-agers faked a federal gun
license and bought semiautomatic handguns over the Internet from a
gun dealer, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the 17-year-old boys, both students at Montclair
High School, had purchased at least eight handguns online from a
Texas-based gun distributor since March. They also said the pair
may have placed orders for up to 20 more pistols, but did not
receive them, over a longer time.
</P>
<P>
   Local and state police and federal officials found several fake
firearms licenses and three loaded, 9 mm semiautomatic Glock
pistols after raiding one of the boys' homes. Two other handguns
that had been paid for had not yet been delivered to the home, the
address for a bogus company called ''Clint's Guns Distributors,''
said Montclair Police Chief Thomas Russo.
</P>
<P>
   He said it appeared the boys' parents were unaware of their gun
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   The raid happened Tuesday after authorities set up a
''controlled delivery.'' A postal inspector posing as a United
Parcel Service worker delivered a handgun to one of the teens.
Authorities said they descended on the house with a search warrant
after seeing one of the boys sign for the package. They used a
battering ram to smash open the door after the teen refused to open
it.
</P>
<P>
   Police said besides the guns and the bogus licenses, they seized
a personal computer used to make the gun purchases. The State
Police High Tech Unit was looking through the computer for evidence
in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The second teen's home was searched after the afternoon raid.
</P>
<P>
   Russo said authorities were still looking for three other
handguns and 90 rounds of ammunition. A Thursday afternoon
locker-by-locker search with the help of police dogs at Montclair
High School -- requested by school officials -- turned up no weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The high school seniors were held Tuesday night in the Essex
County Youth House and were charged with conspiracy, three counts
of forgery and three counts of unlawful possession of a weapon. The
juveniles, whose names were withheld because of their ages, later
were released to their parents.
</P>
<P>
   The youths also could face federal charges. The Essex County
Prosecutor's Office was still deciding whether to try the teens as
adults, said Chief Assistant Prosecutor Norman Menz.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said they didn't know why the boys were buying the
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't predict what these kids were going to do with these
guns,'' Russo told The Star-Ledger of Newark for Saturday's
editions. ''But certainly at least a tragedy has been averted here,
be it hurting themselves or others, or even in the commission of a
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Classmates said the pair, who have been suspended from school,
are former football players who like to sometimes play the role of
class clown.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're two of the funniest guys you'll ever know,'' Terah
Johnson, a senior at the high school, told The Star-Ledger.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the pair apparently had caused no trouble in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   ''To my knowledge, they were never problem students,'' Russo
said.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper cited two unnamed sources in saying the boys began
their gun-dealing after posing as adults in an Internet chat room
and asking a Florida gun dealer for advice on how they could open
their own gunshop. The dealer sent the pair a copy of his license
and the teens copied that license, forming the bogus company, the
newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't clear how authorities uncovered the boys' activities.
</P>
<P>
   Russo said a UPS worker alerted authorities after becoming
suspicious of a package bearing the name of a gun company being
delivered to a residential address.
</P>
<P>
   But according to another account, a package in transit opened
during handling and was sent back to the Texas distributor. The
distributor notified federal authorities after seeing the New
Jersey address and the Florida gun license, said Tony Esposito, a
spokesman for the U.S. Postal Inspection Service.

<HEADLINE> WHO Takes On Challenges, New &AMP; Old  </HEADLINE>
By CLARE NULLIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- The World Health Organization called Saturday for
more concerted international action against AIDS, malaria, and
smoking-related diseases, while also raising concerns on new issues
like bioethics and cloning.
</P>
<P>
   Closing its annual six-day conference at its Geneva
headquarters, the WHO presented a long list of action needed to
fight the world's most formidable health problems, including HIV,
which has infected about 34 million people worldwide and threatens
to reverse social and economic developments Africa has made in the
past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   The 191-nation assembly said more must be done to improve access
to drugs to treat HIV, AIDS and related illnesses in developing
countries. African nations have complained that recent promises by
pharmaceutical companies to slash treatment prices didn't go far
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are about to give new directions and a new energy to an
expanded, revitalized response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic,'' WHO
Director-General Gro-Harlem Brundtland said in a closing speech.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. organization also called for better price databases to
allow countries to shop around for the cheapest drugs, though the
United States and European countries successfully argued against
having one centralized database operated by the WHO.
</P>
<P>
   With limited resources -- less than $850 million in its budget
this year -- the Western nations argued that the WHO had to be
selective with its programs.
</P>
<P>
   In other resolutions adopted Saturday, the WHO assembly urged
governments to introduce more national measures like healthy eating
programs and tobacco taxation to cut heart disease, cancer and
respiratory illness.
</P>
<P>
   It said there should be more cooperation with industry and
consumer organizations to tackle the growing threat from foodborne
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates also discussed plans for the WHO to become more active
on issues like human cloning, with France spearheading widespread
concern about the U.N. agency's relative silence in the
international bioethics debate.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is still struggling with a structural overhaul
initiated by Brundtland, who took over two years ago replacing
Hiroshi Nakajima of Japan. Though her corporate-like management
style and fast pace have caused disquiet among WHO staff,
Brundtland has won widespread praise among member governments.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's breathed new life into WHO,'' said U.S. delegate Thomas
Novotny.
</P>
<P>
   Novotny said Brundtland's plans for a global anti-tobacco treaty
were ''really, really wonderful.'' Brundtland suggested the treaty
to stem smoking-related deaths, estimated at 4 million worldwide
this year.
</P>
<P>
   African officials praised the WHO's new projects against
malaria, as well as its alliance with the private sector to
increase vaccinations against childhood diseases, such as measles,
tetanus, diphtheria and polio.
</P>
<P>
   But Brundtland had to concede that the target of ending all
transmission of the polio virus by the end of this year would not
be achieved because of conflict in several African countries
frustrating vital immunization campaigns. The virus also continued
to exist in parts of India.
</P>
<P>
   And with an estimated 2.5 billion people living in poverty with
little or no access to health care, the WHO assembly made no
reference to its long-treasured motto: ''Health for All by the Year
2000.''

<HEADLINE> Cubans Rally for Elian's Return  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARIEL, Cuba (AP) -- Cubans rallied for Elian Gonzalez's return
Saturday, gathering by the tens of thousands and chanting the boy's
name in front of a stage decorated with a gigantic photograph of
the 6-year-old and his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   The rally under a bright sun was held at the port best known as
the departure point for thousands of Cubans who fled the island in
rafts and boats during a 1980 exodus. The crowd listened for two
hours to speeches and performances by military officers, student
leaders, youth choirs, music groups and children.
</P>
<P>
   ''Return Elian! Return Elian!'' the crowd chanted during the
event.
</P>
<P>
   During her turn on the stage, 5-year-old Maithe Mezquia
suggested to the crowd: ''Let's send a kiss to the Comandante'' --
Fidel Castro, who was not present. Gen. Raul Castro, chief of the
Revolutionary Armed Forces and the Cuban leader's younger brother,
was in the front row with other top officials.
</P>
<P>
   Castro called for a national campaign of mass rallies demanding
Elian's return shortly after the boy was rescued from the waters
off Florida in late November. His mother and 10 others had died in
a failed attempt to flee Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   After staying with Miami relatives for several months, Elian was
reunited in April with his father, who wants to take his son back
to the communist island. Father and son are staying at a farm in
Maryland while awaiting an appeals court decision on the Miami
relatives' request that a political asylum hearing be held for the
boy.

<HEADLINE> Congo Rebels Accused of Slaughter  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- Congolese rebels massacred more than 300
people in a village in eastern Congo, hacking many of the victims
to death before throwing them in a river, a Rome-based missionary
news agency reported Saturday. Rebels denied the allegation.
</P>
<P>
   The MISNA agency, citing unidentified sources, said the
Rwandan-backed rebels of the Congolese Rally for Democracy last
week attacked Katogota, 35 miles south of the Lake Kivu port of
Bukavu.
</P>
<P>
   There was no independent confirmation of the report. The news
agency said that, in general, it draws its reports in developing
countries from lay people and officials, as well as missionaries.
But it does not identify sources it thinks might be put in danger.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the rebels have accused the missionary news agency
of inflating the casualties in the civil war and spreading
anti-rebel feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel spokesman Kin-Kiey Mulumba said that in this case, most of
the villagers had fled Katogota and no civilian casualties occurred
when rebels attacked in retaliation for the death of one of their
commanders. The commander was killed in an ambush in the village by
a pro-government militia, Mulumba said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their count is surrealist,'' Mulumba said by telephone from
the eastern rebel stronghold of Goma. ''We've launched our own
inquiry into this incident, and we'll investigate. Anyone else,
including the United Nations, is free to join.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have been fighting for more than a year to oust
President Laurent Kabila. They are unpopular in eastern Congo,
where the war-wearied population regard them as accomplices of
their foreign backers, Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the New York-based Human Rights Watch accused
the rebels and their Rwandan army allies of raping and killing
civilians to punish them for allegedly supporting their enemies,
the Rwandan Hutu militiamen and pro-government forces. Mulumba on
Friday denied those accusations and invited the United Nations to
investigate any human rights abuses.

<HEADLINE> MDs Said Reluctant To Break Bad News  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Terminally ill cancer patients rarely get a
straight answer when they ask doctors how long they have to live, a
new survey suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers found that doctors are likely to be overly
optimistic about their patients' outlooks or simply refuse to say.
Only about one-third are willing to give patients their best guess.
</P>
<P>
   The new research, presented Saturday at the opening of the
annual scientific meeting of the American Society for Clinical
Oncology, suggests that not only are doctors bad at making
predictions, but they are also uncomfortable passing the
information to the people they treat, at least when the message is
discouraging.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Elizabeth Lamont of the University of Chicago, one of the
researchers, said the doctors' lack of candor is probably
well-intentioned. They fear the truth may harm their patients,
perhaps by becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It shows a lot of caring and not malice,'' she said. ''They
are genuinely concerned about their patients, is my guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the doctors argue that honesty is probably better for
their patients than a well-meaning falsehood.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nicholas Christakis, a co-author of the study, noted that
many patients die in pain, institutionalized and broke.
</P>
<P>
   ''I firmly believe that a lot of these deficits could be
partially addressed if people had access to more reliable
prognostic information,'' he said. ''Part of the reason we die
badly is because we don't see death coming and we don't plan
accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Christakis said patients need reliable information so they can
get their finances in order, redo their wills, decide whether to
enter experimental drug studies or ask family members to take time
off from work to care for them.
</P>
<P>
   The study involved 258 doctors caring for 326 cancer patients
who were entering five Chicago hospices. When asked by the
researchers, nearly all the doctors were willing to estimate their
patients' survival time. But when asked what they would say if the
patients insisted on knowing these predictions, only about
one-third of the doctors said they would give a truthful answer.
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter said they would refuse to answer at all, saying
something like, ''Only God knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Another 40 percent said they would give an inaccurate estimate.
Nearly three-quarters of these doctors would sugarcoat the answer,
telling patients they will live longer than they really believe.
The rest would paint a picture even more grim than necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Christakis said there are many reasons to avoid a straight
answer, including the sheer unpleasantness of delivering bad news.
However, he said, many ''believe these will be self-fulfilling
prophecies, that bad news can contribute to bad outcomes.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Gradishar of Northwestern University, who was not
involved in the research, said the data ''suggest doctors tend to
be overly optimistic. It gets to the difficulty of breaking bad
news, although one would assume that news has already been broken
if people are going into hospices.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally, people are admitted to hospice care only if they have
six months or less to live. Christakis said the doctors'
unwillingness to be open with these patients suggests that in
everyday practice, they might be even less willing to tell the
truth than the survey suggests.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier report published in February in the British
Medical Journal, the doctors checked how accurate the doctors'
predictions actually turned out to be. It found they were usually
off target and on average assumed the patients would live five
times longer than they actually did.

<HEADLINE> Slave Labor Payment Effort Boosted  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL GEITNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Still more than $1.8 billion short of their goal,
organizers of a German fund to compensate Nazi-era slave and forced
laborers were looking for ways Saturday to increase pressure on
companies that have not yet contributed.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation collecting German industry's half of the $8.9
billion fund is running two-page ads in national newspapers this
weekend thanking the 2,048 companies -- from Allianz insurance to
knife-maker Zwilling J.A. Henckels -- that have already made
pledges.
</P>
<P>
   But with only $2.6 billion raised so far, the ads also appeal to
other companies to join. German officials hoped to have the funds
together by the summer so as to begin payments this year.
</P>
<P>
   Initiative spokesman Wolfgang Gibowski said the foundation was
considering releasing a longer list of all companies it believes
should be contributing. That would include firms that did not use
forced or slave labor or were not even founded until after the war,
but which the foundation feels should contribute to show solidarity
with the cause.
</P>
<P>
   The Berliner Morgenpost reported Saturday that list would
include such names as sporting goods maker Adidas, the German
division of Avis rental cars and the cigarette firm Rothmanns.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the Welt am Sonntag newspaper reported that Deputy
Finance Minister Manfred Overhaus had contacted several companies
that are at least partially state-owned and stipulated
contributions they should make. Those include banks, the postal
service, the national railway and Deutsche Telekom, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
   The paper said Overhaus was seeking to raise $445 million from
those companies toward the government's share of the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Finance Ministry spokesman Torsten Albig said the law being
drafted to implement the slave labor fund agreement foresees the
participation of state-owned companies. ''And they will do that,''
he said.

<HEADLINE> Collapse won't affect Penn's Landing development  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL RUBINKAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The deadly collapse of a wooden pier within
walking distance of Penn's Landing on Thursday will not affect the
construction timetable of a $190 million entertainment and retail
complex on the Philadelphia waterfront, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   After years of delay, construction at Penn's Landing is finally
set to begin in August or September. Opening is slated for fall
2002. With cities like Baltimore and New York having so much
success attracting visitors to their own redeveloped waterfronts,
Philadelphia has a lot riding on its ambitious project.
</P>
<P>
   The pier collapse ''wouldn't appear to have any effect on our
development plans,'' said Billie Scott, a spokeswoman for Simon
Property Group Inc., the Indianapolis-based developer.
</P>
<P>
   Three women -- all employees of the New Jersey State Aquarium in
Camden, N.J. -- were killed and 37 were injured Thursday night when
the pier, which supported a new outdoor nightclub called Heat,
collapsed into the murky waters of the Delaware River.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities were still trying to determine a cause.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, another 20-foot by 15-foot section of the pier
collapsed Saturday morning into the Delaware River, said police
spokesman Corp. Jim Pauley. No one was injured, but divers
searching the river were pulled out of the area.
</P>
<P>
   The three women killed were among six aquarium employees
celebrating the birthday of DeAnn White, the aquarium's public
relations manager. A resident of Philadelphia's Germantown section,
she would have turned 26 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Ferraro, 27, of Cherry Hill, was an eight-year employee at
the aquarium and had recently been promoted to marketing manager.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Rodriguez, 22, had just finished the first day at her new
job. Rodriguez, also of Cherry Hill, had been hired as a special
events assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the other three workers attending were injured.
</P>
<P>
   A number of restaurants and nightclubs catering to the
college-age crowd sit on the waterfront's ''finger'' piers -- some
believed to be 100 years old -- in the former industrial area. Mayor
John F. Street has ordered inspections for all of them and will
talk with engineers and other officials on establishing a regular
inspection, maintenance and certification process.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a tragic incident,'' Street said after touring the
scene of the accident on a Coast Guard utility boat in the pouring
rain on a cold, gray Saturday afternoon. ''We will do everything we
can to see to it that nothing like this ever happens again.''
</P>
<P>
   Street says he plans to discuss with engineers how such
inspections should take place and how often. In the meantime, he
said a visual inspection Friday of the buildings on all city piers
found no evidence that any others are unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a very, very busy time at Penn's Landing and on our
waterfront and we just want people to feel absolutely, 100 percent
secure in using (these) facilities,'' Street said.
</P>
<P>
   Club owners, however, maintain they are completely safe. Clark
Mahoney, general manager of Rock Lobster, said the nightclub's pier
is inspected every year and can ''easily accommodate our current
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Batt, executive director of the Waterfront Business
Association, said other businesses on the piers are likewise
diligent about inspections. None are planning to close pending the
safety review, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not think it will have a great negative impact'' on
business, Batt said.
</P>
<P>
   Others aren't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think people who will be affected will be some of the club
owners and some of the more temporary club structures,'' said Meryl
Levitz, head of the Greater Philadelphia Tourism Marketing Corp.
''Local people might have second thoughts about that, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   The piers originally supported warehouses but were converted
into restaurants and clubs in the 1980s and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   With so much at stake on the project, officials sought to
distance the complex -- only three decades old -- from its neighbors.
Most of Penn's Landing sits on dry land, with only a small portion
jutting out into the water, they pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been getting the message out that this is an entirely
different situation and they should not have any concerns about the
safety of Penn's Landing,'' said Dominic Sabatini, president of the
Penn's Landing Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, the Simon Group spokeswoman, said she would be more
worried about visitors' perceptions of the waterfront's safety if
the complex was opening sooner than it is.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we were open and operating or scheduled to open in the very
near future, anyone would have cause for concern about
perception,'' Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   The expanded Penn's Landing will be three times larger than
Baltimore's glittery Inner Harbor and feature a 30,0000-square-foot
FAO Schwarz store and other retailers, a children's museum, upscale
restaurants, an amphitheater, movie theaters and an aerial tram
over the Delaware to Camden.
</P>
<P>
   Officials hope the project will breathe new life into the area
where William Penn first set foot in Philadelphia in 1682.

<HEADLINE> Haiti Prepares For Elections  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE FAUL
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Torn between fears of violence and
a burning desire to change their lives, Haitians have a chance to
choose a new Parliament on Sunday in long-delayed elections that
would restore a legal government and foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   But a flare-up of political violence, government foot-dragging
and bumbling preparations could mean trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know everyone says there's going to be violence, and not to
go out and vote, but I'm going no matter what,'' said 30-year-old
mason Jesuslhomme Guerrier. ''I'm not going to let the macoutes
(bandits) run our country again.''
</P>
<P>
   Haitians who have largely boycotted an electoral process fraught
with fraud and disorganization over recent years have registered to
vote en masse, some 4 million of the 8 million people in a country
where half the population is under 18.
</P>
<P>
   But many voters' enthusiasm has been doused by fear and more
than a dozen assassinations that prompted opposition candidates to
stop campaigning. The United States and United Nations -- which
intervened to restore democracy in 1994 -- worry their experiment to
instill democracy in this Caribbean nation is unraveling.
</P>
<P>
   ''By turning out to register in large numbers, Haitians have
demonstrated their commitment ... to the democratic process,'' U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's turnout will show whether Haitians can overcome their
fears.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning ended on a dull note Friday, with just 200 people
showing up for a rally of former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's
Lavalas Family in the seaside shantytown of Cite Soleil, a party
stronghold.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition parties say the elections are being rigged to favor
Lavalas and set up a dictatorship under the populist Aristide, who
few doubt will win presidential elections planned for November.
</P>
<P>
   Overthrown in a 1991 coup, Aristide was restored to power after
the 1994 invasion. Barred by law from seeking a consecutive term,
he picked Rene Preval to succeed him in 1995 elections that brought
Haiti's first democratic handover of power.
</P>
<P>
   Preval created an unconstitutional government by disbanding
Parliament in 1999 and appointing a new premier by decree.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's elections -- postponed at least four times since 1998 --
give Haitians a chance to right things and, in the process, free
$500 million in foreign aid desperately needed in a country where
65 percent of the work force is unemployed, average annual income
is less then $350 and 80 percent of children go to bed hungry.
</P>
<P>
   The vote also will test Aristide's ability to stock Parliament
and thousands of local government offices with Lavalas loyalists.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Haiti's U.N.-trained police force has been unable --
or unwilling -- to stop pre-election violence, and only 3,500
officers will police Sunday's balloting.
</P>
<P>
   ''Short of a miracle, I don't see how we can have credible
elections,'' opposition politician Evans Paul said after a grenade
exploded Thursday at the gate to the electoral council office,
injuring seven passers-by.
</P>
<P>
   The attack, he said, was intended ''to intimidate the
independent voter into staying at home, leaving the field wide open
for Aristide partisans.''
</P>
<P>
   Lavalas Family spokesmen routinely deny the party is behind the
violence.
</P>
<P>
   From afar, the United States and the United Nations -- which have
invested more than $1 billion in Haiti since the 1994 intervention
-- are keeping their fingers crossed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite all the difficulties observed, credible legislative,
municipal and local elections are still possible,'' the
Organization of American States said Friday.

<HEADLINE> Lazio Announces Senate Candidacy  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST ISLIP, N.Y. (AP) -- From the gym of his former high school
on Long Island, relatively unknown Republican Rep. Rick Lazio
catapulted himself Saturday into the nation's most-talked about
political campaign -- the Senate race against Hillary Rodham
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can tell from my accent that I am a lifelong New Yorker,''
Lazio said in an obvious swipe at the first lady. ''I don't have to
fake it. ... I've never needed an exploratory committee to help me
figure out where I wanted to live.''
</P>
<P>
   The official announcement, less than 24 hours after New York
City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani dropped out of the Senate race,
launched the 42-year-old, four-term congressman into the national
spotlight. He was scheduled to appear on the five major Sunday TV
news shows.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic National Committee Chairman Joe Andrew said Saturday
that Giuliani's departure and replacement by Lazio improved
Clinton's chances of winning.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lazio is more conservative -- the lines (between Lazio and
Clinton) are much clearer. He'll be an easier candidate to beat,''
Andrew said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio acknowledged facing an uphill battle against the first
lady -- one poll already showed her with a huge lead over Lazio. But
he sounded an optimistic note to supporters who sported T-shirts
reading, ''Lazio -- Made in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Here in New York, we love underdogs,'' Lazio told the cheering
crowd. ''I can't call on Air Force One whenever I need a ride, but
New Yorkers can count on me and call on me whenever they need
something to get done.''
</P>
<P>
   The location for Saturday's announcement was selected to
emphasize Lazio's New York roots, a contrast with Clinton, who
moved into Westchester County, north of New York City, just five
months ago after declaring her intention to seek the seat of
retiring Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement had a small-town feel, with red, white and blue
balloons inside the gym of West Islip High School. The crowd
cheered throughout the speech by the boyish-looking Lazio, who ran
track at West Islip before graduating in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Top Clinton adviser Harold Ickes on Friday branded Lazio a
puppet of former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, House Majority Leader
Dick Armey and ''the rest of the radical Republican leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio wasted little time in shooting back.
</P>
<P>
   ''My opponent is a liberal and a proud one, and I respect her
for that,'' Lazio said. ''But make no mistake, she is no more a new
Democrat than she is a New Yorker.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who found out last month that he has prostate cancer,
dropped out of the Senate race Friday, saying he wanted to put his
health first. That shifted attention to Lazio and fellow Long
Island congressman Peter King, but King backed off plans to run and
instead endorsed Lazio on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio starts the race far short of Clinton in campaign funds. He
has raised $3.5 million, compared with $12 million for the first
lady. However, it is possible under campaign finance laws that
Lazio could receive at least some cash from the Giuliani campaign's
$20 million warchest.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has earned a reputation as an energetic lawmaker, despite
being largely unknown and untested outside his district.
</P>
<P>
   He is a pro-death penalty Roman Catholic and while he supports
abortion rights generally, he's against Medicaid funding for
abortions and the late-term procedure that opponents call ''partial
birth'' abortions.
</P>
<P>
   He boasts a strong environmental record, supports gun control
measures and is fiscally conservative. Asked by Republican House
leaders this year to take the lead on a minimum wage increase,
Lazio pushed to include tax breaks for businesses, making the
package acceptable to his more conservative GOP colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was nominated as the Democratic Party candidate on
Tuesday. The state GOP nominating convention is May 30.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like to welcome to Congressman Lazio into the race for
the Senate,'' Clinton said during a stop Saturday in Mt. Kisco,
N.Y., at a Boys and Girls Club award ceremony. ''I'm looking
forward to a real discussion with him of the issues.''

four peacekeeping missions. Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., believes it is unfair for
U.S. taxpayers to pay for part of the U.N. operations in Congo, Kosovo, East
Timor and Sierra Leone, a spokesman said today. The money originally was
intended for other purposes by the State Department, but later was set aside to
help pay for the peacekeeping efforts and therefore required Gregg's approval,

<HEADLINE> 22-year-old gets 25 years in prison for 1998 shooting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y.(AP) -- A white man who shot a black woman in what
one prosecutor described as a ''human hunting trip'' into a
predominantly black neighborhood was sentenced Friday to the
maximum of 25 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   In December of 1998, Rudolf Berry and his friend William Hines,
both of the Schenectady County town of Rotterdam, traveled into
Albany, about 11 miles away. Berry shot a 9-mm rifle from the car
as Hines allegedly drove, wounding 39-year-old Sonya Thompson of
Albany.
</P>
<P>
   After their arrests, police said the men confessed to traveling
to Albany specifically to shoot a black person.
</P>
<P>
   But in his statement to police, Berry said he just wanted fire
the gun out the car window and wake people up. He said he didn't
see Thompson when he fired the shot.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government didn't pursue hate crimes against the two
because an FBI probe didn't find enough evidence of federal hate
crimes violations.
</P>
<P>
   County Judge Thomas A. Breslin chastised Berry for getting
''loaded on booze and marijuana'' and ''when that wasn't
enough...to drive to this community and level a gun out a window
and shoot someone is just preposterous.''
</P>
<P>
   Hines' trial has yet to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson was treated and released from Albany Medical Center
Hospital shortly after being struck in the right front side of her
neck by a slug from a 9 mm rifle.
</P>
<P>
   At the sentencing, she urged Berry to do some ''conscientious
thinking.''

<HEADLINE> Prisoner Abuse Indictment Dismissed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- A federal judge has dismissed a criminal
indictment against a former sheriff's deputy accused of letting a
dog bite a prisoner during a videotaped jail shakedown in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Sam Kent granted the dismissal Friday at the
request of U.S. attorneys who failed to convince 10 of 12 jurors in
October that dog-handler David Cisneros committed a felony civil
rights violation against inmate Toby Hawthorne.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Kent nor prosecutors explained the dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorne and dozens of other Missouri prison inmates were
housed in the Brazoria County Jail, where the shakedown occurred,
under a contract with a private corrections firm.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing the video, ostensibly made for training purposes,
Missouri canceled its contract and moved its prisoners out of
Texas. The tape showed prisoners being electrically jolted and
kicked.
</P>
<P>
   ttorney Guy Womack said Cisneros, who faced up to 10 years in
prison, was relieved the case had been dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bite was never intentional,'' Womack said. ''You can tell
very clearly from the videotape that David was pulling back on the
leash, trying to stop the dog from even nipping the inmate.''
</P>
<P>
   Two former guards were sentenced earlier this year for their
roles in the incident. Wilton David Wallace was sentenced to four
years for kicking Hawthorne and injuring another inmate. Lester
Arnold received a one-year sentence for using a stun gun on
Hawthorne.
</P>
<P>
   Also in January, a federal judge approved a $2.2 million
settlement in a class-action case brought by Missouri inmates who
claimed they were abused while housed in Texas jails. The lawsuit
was sparked by the videotape.

<HEADLINE> 28 Officers Implicated in LAPD  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Prosecutors have turned over to defense
lawyers the names of 28 officers implicated in a police corruption
scandal, along with transcripts of interviews with the disgraced
officer whose allegations led to the dismissal of dozens of
convictions, the Los Angeles Times reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The officers are suspected of misconduct ranging from planting
evidence to unjustified shootings, the newspaper said. Four of the
28 remain on active duty, three of them at the Rampart Division
that is at the heart of the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there is a strong suspicion that they have been engaged in
misconduct, they should be placed on administrative leave
immediately,'' said Public Defender Michael Judge.
</P>
<P>
   Cmdr. David Kalish, a police spokesman, declined to comment to
the Times on why the officers were still working. Kalish did not
immediately return a phone call Saturday from The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office,
said Saturday that information had been turned over to the public
defender, but she was unable to confirm how many officers' names
were presented.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney's office will present more names as early
as this week, spokeswoman Victoria Pipkin said. ''This was just the
beginning,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Following days of negotiations, District Attorney Gil Garcetti
on Friday turned over 3,242 pages of transcribed interviews to the
defender lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The had been seeking the information since the scandal broke in
September. Allegations by former officer Rafael Perez that
anti-gang officers in the Rampart area lied in court and framed
suspects have led to the dismissal of more than 80 criminal
convictions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We felt we should have had this information a long time ago,''
Judge said. ''The failure to disclose this information has
significantly impeded our ability to identify the cases that
warrant reopening, as well as to successfully defend innocent
people charged in current cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys received the Perez transcripts and other
information under an agreement that bars them from revealing it on
threat of contempt.

<HEADLINE> 9 Wounded at Columbine Graduate  </HEADLINE>
By JON SARCHE
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENWOOD VILLAGE, Colo. (AP) -- Nine students wounded in the
worst school shooting in U.S. history, including two left partially
paralyzed, graduated Saturday in Columbine High School's class of
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Castaldo, one of the students paralyzed in the attack,
was relieved to get his diploma.
</P>
<P>
   ''Man, there were a couple of good times,'' Castaldo said this
week. ''But I'm just glad it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 5,000 people filed into an outdoor concert venue in
this suburb south of Denver, about 15 miles east of the school, for
the ceremony, which marked the end of another tragic year for the
school and community.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd included parents, teachers, relatives and students
from other Denver-area high schools.
</P>
<P>
   About 435 students received diplomas in the approximately
two-hour ceremony, which was closed to reporters and the general
public at the request of students and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Columbine seniors Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 12
students and one teacher before committing suicide on April 20,
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Several tragedies followed the massacre in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, the mother of Anne-Marie Hochhalter, a student
partially paralyzed in the massacre who graduated Saturday, killed
herself. In February, in a case that remains unsolved, Columbine
students Nicholas Kunselman, 15, and his girlfriend, Stephanie Hart
Grizzell, 16, were shot to death while on a date at a sandwich
shop. And one week after the first anniversary of the shootings,
the school's star basketball player, Greg Barnes, who had watched
his coach fatally shot a year earlier, hanged himself.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's ceremony followed an event Friday in which three
Columbine students seriously wounded in the attack got to meet some
of the people who donated blood to save their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Hochhalter, Sean Graves and Michael Johnson met with 10 people
who gave blood last April.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Fernandez has donated 18 gallons of blood in his 46 years
because he had a cousin with leukemia. Last April, his blood went
to Hochhalter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I owe them my life,'' Hochhalter said. ''I feel very
privileged.''

<HEADLINE> Lazio says he will run against Hillary Clinton for Senate  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST ISLIP, N.Y. (AP) -- U.S. Rep. Rick Lazio, standing in his
high school gym, announced plans Saturday for the run of his life --
a Senate campaign that pits the unknown Long Island Republican
against first lady Hillary Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can tell from my accent that I am a lifelong New Yorker,''
said Lazio, who ran track at West Islip High School before
graduating in 1976. ''I don't have to fake it. ... I've never
needed an exploratory committee to help me figure out where I
wanted to live.''
</P>
<P>
   The official announcement, coming less than 24 hours after New
York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani dropped out of the Senate race,
catapulted Lazio from semi-obscurity into the national spotlight in
the year's most talked-about political campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The location was selected to emphasize Lazio's New York roots, a
contrast with Democratic candidate Clinton. The first lady moved
into Westchester County just five months ago after declaring her
intention to seek retiring U.S. Senator Daniel Moynihan's seat.
</P>
<P>
   The four-term Congressman acknowledged facing an uphill battle
against the high-profile first lady -- one poll already showed her
with a huge lead over Lazio. But he sounded an optimistic note to
supporters who sported T-shirts reading, ''Lazio -- Made in New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Here in New York, we love underdogs,'' Lazio told the cheering
crowd. ''... I can't call on Air Force One whenever I need a ride,
but New Yorkers can count on me and call on me whenever they need
something to get done.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's announcement had a small-town feel, with red, white and
blue balloons inside the gym. The crowd cheered wildly throughout
the speech by the boyish-looking Lazio, a local boy made good.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki, who had asked Lazio to step aside in
Giuliani's favor last year, said the congressman will be a
formidable opponent for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rick Lazio has the ideas, the energy and the vision to beat
Hillary Clinton in November,'' Pataki said in a press release. ''I
know he will be an effective fighter for all of us as our next
senator.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton acknowledged Lazio's entrance to the race during a stop
Saturday in Mt. Kisco, N.Y. at a Boys and Girls Club award
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like to welcome to Congressman Lazio into the race for
the Senate. I'm looking forward to a real discussion with him of
the issues,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, top Clinton adviser Harold Ickes branded the
42-year-old Lazio as a puppet of ''Newt Gingrich and (House
majority leader) Dick Armey and the rest of the radical Republican
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, a lifelong resident of Long Island, wasted little time in
shooting back Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''My opponent is a liberal and a proud one, and I respect her
for that,'' Lazio said. 'But make no mistake, she is no more a new
Democrat than she is a New Yorker.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Saturday, fellow Long Island congressman Peter King
backed off plans to challenge Lazio for the nomination and instead
endorsed his Republican colleague.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to name recognition, Lazio starts the race short of
Clinton in fund-raising. Lazio has raised $3.5 million, compared to
$12 million for the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible, under campaign finance laws, that Lazio could
receive an infusion of cash from the Giuliani campaign's $20
million warchest.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has earned a reputation as an energetic lawmaker, despite
being largely unknown and untested outside his Suffolk County
district.
</P>
<P>
   He is a pro-death penalty Roman Catholic and while he supports
abortion rights generally, he opposes Medicaid funding and
''partial birth'' abortions, which makes him palatable to the
party's more conservative wing.
</P>
<P>
   He boasts a strong environmental record, supports gun control
measures and is fiscally conservative. Asked by Republican House
leaders this year to take the lead on a minimum wage increase,
Lazio pushed to include tax breaks for businesses that made the
package acceptable to his more conservative GOP colleagues.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Ahead of Israeli Withdrawal  </HEADLINE>
By SAM F. GHATTAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Fighting has intensified seven weeks
ahead of Israel's troop withdrawal deadline, with Israeli warplanes
blasting southern and eastern Lebanon on Saturday and guerrilla
shelling causing power outages in Israeli border communities.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's air force struck suspected guerrilla infiltration
trails at four different locations along the front line, as
guerrillas -- who have pledged to drive the Israelis out in
humiliation -- launched a series of attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Jets also struck deep inside Lebanon, targeting a base for
Syrian-backed radical Palestinian guerrillas near the Syrian
border, Lebanese and Israeli officials said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no independent word on casualties from Saturday's
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli army said it destroyed 10 tanks belonging to the
radical Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General
Command in a raid on the rebel group's Bekaa Valley base. Lebanese
radio said at least three guerrillas died, but security officials
could not confirm the reports.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate comment from the guerrilla group, which
opposes Palestinian peace deals with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said an Israeli naval gunboat was firing shells
Saturday evening, as Israeli and allied militia forces returned
fire on guerrillas attacking an outpost manned by the
Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army. Israel confirmed the fighting
near the Mediterranean coast about 3 miles north of the border.
</P>
<P>
   Guerillas attacked the SLA's hilltop outpost at Hardoun,
launching rocket-propelled grenades and firing machine guns while
senior commanders were inspecting the outpost. The militia fought
back, causing some guerrilla casualties, SLA officials said. No SLA
fighters were hurt in the attack, they said.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli military statement in Jerusalem said that, during the
fighting over Hardoun, Israeli fighter jets attacked suspected
guerrilla targets in a nearby valley.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli jets also fired missiles near the front line village of
Arab Salim. Earlier, jets struck near the market town of Nabatiyeh
inland and in the Iqlim al-Tuffah highlands, Lebanese security
officials in the south said.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the air raids, the Iran-backed Hezbollah said its
guerrillas opened fire late Saturday at the Israeli military
outpost in Abbad, 500 yards from the border, while Israeli forces
were dismantling equipment. The guerillas, it said, scored
''confirmed hits.''
</P>
<P>
   One shell hit an electricity pole in the area, knocking out
power in the Upper Galilee border towns of Manara, Misgav Am, and
Margaliot, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's air raids were the latest in a series against
suspected guerrilla bases, as Israeli troops dismantled or blew up
outposts in their withdrawal from southern Lebanon ahead of a July
7 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah guerillas recently have attacked 11 Israeli and allied
militia outposts in the occupied zone, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lebanon accused retreating Israeli troops of planning
to blow up a strategic mountaintop Crusader-era castle that they
are set to abandon. Sitting 2,362 feet high, Beaufort Castle has a
commanding view of areas of southern Lebanon and northern Israel.
The fort is already in ruins from past fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. and French governments, which contacted Israel, assured
Beirut that the 12th-century castle would not be destroyed,
according to Prime Minister Salim Hoss' office.

<HEADLINE> Barak Delays D.C Trip Amid Violence  </HEADLINE>
By SAMAR ASSAD
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMALLAH, The West Bank (AP) -- Prime Minister Ehud Barak late
Saturday postponed a planned trip to Washington for a meeting with
President Clinton because of continued violence in southern Lebanon
and the Palestinian areas.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released by his office, Barak said that the trip
was being delayed, but gave no alternate date. Barak's spokesman,
Gadi Baltiansky, said it was unlikely the prime minister would be
able to travel later in the week.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement followed a late night security Cabinet meeting
in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   In towns around the Palestinian areas, thousands of
demonstrators threw stones at police and were met with a hail of
rubber-coated steel bullets. More than 100 injuries were reported
in all. Two cameramen from the Reuters news agency were injured by
the rubber-coated bullets, one in the Gaza Strip and the other in
the divided West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank town of Ramallah, clashes escalated after it
was announced that a Palestinian man who was shot in the head by
Israeli army gunfire on Friday had died. Doctors identified the
victim as 28-year-old Issa Abed, a cafeteria worker at nearby Bir
Zeit University.
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday evening, the shops and restaurants of Ramallah had
shut down as the town began an official mourning for Abed. His
death brought to four the number of Palestinians killed in a week
of clashes, including several gunbattles, between Israelis and
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The violence comes as Israel and the Palestinians are working on
a final peace treaty to settle long-standing issues like the nature
of a Palestinian state, the future of Jerusalem and the fate of
Palestinian refugees. The Palestinians want to set up a state with
traditionally Arab east Jerusalem as the capital. They insist that
refugees who fled Israel when it was created in 1948 have the right
to return.
</P>
<P>
   The sides have set a September deadline for a final treaty, but
negotiations have progressed slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning last Sunday, Palestinians took to the streets to press
demands for the release of 1,650 prisoners held by Israel for
anti-Israeli attacks. On Monday, Palestinian police and civilian
activists of Arafat's party opened fire on Israeli soldiers.
Palestinian activists declared Friday and Saturday ''days of rage''
to draw attention to the prisoner issue.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has threatened to delay an upcoming Israeli withdrawal
from three West Bank villages next to Jerusalem if the violence is
not immediately curtailed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, that violence continued unabated. In Hebron, about
1,500 demonstrators marched toward an Israeli army checkpoint at
the entrance to the Israeli-controlled downtown area Saturday.
Palestinian police did not intervene. Standing on rooftops and
behind cement blocks, Israeli troops fired rubber bullets at
hundreds of stone throwers.
</P>
<P>
   Twirling a slingshot, Ahmed Qawasmeh, 22, said he has a brother
in jail and would do whatever he can to win his release.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were waiting for this moment to show our anger and our
disappointment over the peace process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Paramedics trying to evacuate one injured demonstrator dropped
him repeatedly to duck stones and rubber bullets. Another
Palestinian was about to throw a stone when he was hit in the chest
by a rubber bullet and fell to the ground. Three bystanders carried
him to an ambulance, one of six on standby at the scene. In all, 31
people were injured in Hebron, paramedics said.
</P>
<P>
   North of Hebron, a bus carrying Israeli Arabs was stoned by
Palestinians, the army said, injuring one passenger slightly.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank town of Nablus, medical officials said two
Palestinians were injured moderately by live bullets shot by
Israeli soldiers. The army said it was checking into the claims.
Four others were injured in Nablus by rubber bullets, including one
man who was shot in the eye.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank town of Tulkarem, about 400 Palestinians threw
stones at Israeli soldiers guarding a crossing point into Israel. A
phalanx of six Israeli jeeps tried to hold the crowd at bay. About
two dozen young men took cover behind barrels just 20 yards from
the Israeli soldiers, lunging forward from time to time to throw
stones. Thirty Palestinians were hurt, medical officials said.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli soldier was injured slightly by stones in Tulkarem
and a second soldier suffered slight injuries near Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the West Bank, 22 Palestinians were injured in
clashes in the town of Ramallah and 20 in the town of Jenin,
according to the officials. Almost all the injuries were from
rubber bullets.
</P>
<P>
   In the Gaza Strip, hundreds of Palestinian police tried to keep
stone-throwers away from an isolated Israeli army post near the
Jewish settlement of Netzarim. At first Palestinian police moved
aggressively, tackling stone-throwers, bundling them into pickup
trucks and driving them away. However, most of the demonstrators
made their way back to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   At least six injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   In southern and eastern Lebanon on Saturday, Israeli airstrikes
and guerrilla shelling caused power outages in border communities.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's air force struck suspected guerrilla infiltration
trails at four different locations along the front line, as
guerrillas -- who have pledged to drive the Israelis out in
humiliation -- launched a series of attacks.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Vote Violence Is Expected  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Elections Zimbabwe-style have never been
free of violence and intimidation -- it's only the scale that has
differed, participants say.
</P>
<P>
   Violence and punitive attacks around elections in areas where
opposition candidates show strength has been the norm since the
nation's first all-race elections in 1979 that led to independence
from Britain. But this time, it's worse.
</P>
<P>
   President Robert Mugabe, the country's single ruler since
independence, has called elections for June 24-25. The poll signals
the biggest challenge yet to his two-decade hold on power because
of the emergence of a strong challenger -- the labor-backed Movement
for Democratic Change party.
</P>
<P>
   And already the killing has begun.
</P>
<P>
   At least 23 government opponents have died in political violence
since the government lost a constitutional referendum in February --
its biggest defeat at the polls since independence.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of others have been assaulted or had their rural homes
torched, mainly by ruling party supporters, the main opposition
party has alleged. Many have fled to towns.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are now seeing far greater violence to scare the new
opposition,'' said Masipula Sithole, an opposition candidate in the
last parliamentary elections in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Sithole, a political scientist at Harare's University of
Zimbabwe, ran for the small Zimbabwe Unity Movement, which failed
to win any seats in the 120 elected constituencies. ZUM attracted
less than 5 percent of ballots cast.
</P>
<P>
   In the run-up to that poll, Sithole received death threats from
anonymous callers and suspected ruling party militants failed in a
bid to firebomb his car, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were a small, alternative voice. We were of little
consequence but we were still seen as daring to oppose Mugabe and
that made us his enemy, one to be crushed,'' Sithole said.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe's first response to the Movement for Democratic Change
was to crack down, using ruling party militants and veterans of the
1970s liberation war against white rule to assault opposition
supporters and their backers, including white farmers, Sithole
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mobs of squatters and ruling party militants have illegally and
violently staked claims to land on more than 1,200 white-owned
farms in recent months, demanding that farmers withdraw their
support for the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, another 13 white-owned farms have been occupied,
the Commercial Farmers Union said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Dongo, who also stood against the ruling party in the
last 1995 parliamentary poll, won her seat as one of three
opposition lawmakers only after the High Court ruled voting was
rigged in her area.
</P>
<P>
   Ballot boxes had been stuffed with more pro-Mugabe votes than
the number of voters registered in Dongo's constituency.
</P>
<P>
   Dongo had also received threats. A firebomb was hurled at her
home. Her supporters were beaten and hounded by the ruling Zimbabwe
African National Union Patriotic Front, or ZANU PF, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's ZANU PF's way of campaigning. It hasn't changed except we
are seeing more violence,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai said his party was urging
supporters to discard party T-shirts and membership cards to
protect themselves from assailants who search for opposition
materials, often in house-to-house raids late at night.
</P>
<P>
   ''Intimidation is so massive we advise our members to avoid
openly showing they are for MDC,'' Tsvangirai said.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning Zimbabwe-style has usually been accompanied by
punitive attacks and recrimination after polling results have gone
against candidates favored by Mugabe, said Sithole, the former
opposition candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, he believes, voters won't be fazed by those
memories.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can abuse people only so far. I think Zimbabweans have
been pushed across the line,'' he said. ''There's no coming back to
subservience.''

<HEADLINE> Lawyers Seek Delay in Border Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Attorneys for Ahmed Ressam, an Algerian accused
of smuggling explosives into Washington state from Canada, have
asked a federal judge for more time to prepare their case.
</P>
<P>
   Trial is scheduled to begin July 10 in Los Angeles, but Ressam's
public defenders asked for a delay until February.
</P>
<P>
   In papers filed in federal court Friday, they told U.S. District
Judge John Coughenour they needed more time to review thousands of
documents and the evidence prosecutors have gathered in their case
against the 32-year-old Ressam.
</P>
<P>
   Arguments on the motion were set for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Diskin, head of the prosecution team, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Coughenour in March granted a defense request to move the trial
to Los Angeles because of extensive publicity about the case in the
Seattle area.

   Ressam was arrested Dec. 14 at the U.S.-Canadian border station
at Port Angeles as he tried to enter the country on a ferry.
Customs inspectors said they found bomb-making materials and four
timing devices in the spare-tire compartment of his rental car.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury indicted Ressam on nine counts, including
conspiracy to commit a terrorist act in the United States. If
convicted of all counts, Ressam could face more than 90 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors say the arrest exposed an international
terrorist plot that has resulted in three other arrests in
Washington, Montreal and New York. The government has also offered
a $5 million reward for 31-year-old Abdelmajid Dahoumane, another
Algerian who authorities say was staying with Ressam in Canada just
before the arrest.

<HEADLINE> Gunshot Critically Injures La. Girl  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHREVEPORT, La. (AP) -- A game of cops and robbers with a real
handgun nearly killed a 7-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   Her 8-year-old brother found the handgun on top of a VCR while
the children were alone after school Friday, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The TEC-9 semiautomatic pistol was loaded with a 30-round clip.
One bullet fired during the game, and hit the girl in the side,
Officer Stacey Adams said. The boy ran across the street and told a
neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   The girl remained in critical condition Saturday at Louisiana
State University hospital. Neither child's name was released.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said their mother's boyfriend picked them up from school
and asked a neighbor to watch them while he paid a bill.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how long the boyfriend was gone. Police arrested
him outside the house on misdemeanor marijuana possession. A felony
charge of second-degree cruelty to a juvenile later was added.
</P>
<P>
   The boy will not be charged because the shooting was accidental
and because of his age, Sgt. Jimmy Muller said.

<HEADLINE> Reputed mob associate's tip leads to body beneath basement  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Federal investigators have found the corpse
of a man buried for at least 25 years beneath the basement of a
building where reputed mob associate Pete ''The Crumb'' Caprio once
ran a social club.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Caprio, who has become a cooperating witness
since he was charged in March with helping in two gangland
executions, tipped them off to the body under the three-story
building on Hudson Street.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators on Tuesday left mounds of dirt behind the sealed
building after the search for the remains of a man known only as
''Butch,'' according to a report in Saturday's editions of The
Star-Ledger of Newark. City records indicated the building belongs
to Caprio's brother, Alphonse.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Caroll, an FBI spokeswoman, confirmed only that a search
warrant had been executed at the building. She said recent
developments in the case kept her from making any additional
comments.
</P>
<P>
   But The Star-Ledger cited unidentified sources in reporting
Caprio had implicated two mob figures in that killing. The sources
also told the newspaper the people implicated had been dead for
some time.
</P>
<P>
   Observers have said the 70-year-old Caprio could be used to
build a federal racketeering case against Joseph ''Skinny Joey''
Merlino, of Philadelphia, and 10 others. Merlino is the reputed
boss of the Bruno organized crime family.
</P>
<P>
   Although the government's case has been reinforced with the help
of another gangland turncoat, former Bruno boss Ralph Natale,
observers said Caprio could give investigators an idea of the
family's hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   It's also likely Caprio would be able to talk about the
influence of the family's Philadelphia mob bosses over activities
in northern New Jersey such as gambling, loansharking and murder.
</P>
<P>
   Caprio was indicted in March on charges he participated in the
1996 murder of reputed Bruno organized crime family captain Joseph
Sodano and the 1994 death of William ''Crazy Willie'' Gantz. Gantz
was reported to be Sodano's right-hand man.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have theorized Sodano was killed after he refused
to give Natale and Merlino a bigger cut of profits from illegal
gambling and loansharking operations in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment said Caprio participated in the murders with
others ''for the purpose of maintaining and increasing their
position in the North Jersey crew of the Bruno crime family.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Robert Sarcone, who represented Caprio at arraignment,
has said his client wasn't the shooter. No others have been
arrested in the case.

<P>
   RAMALLAH, The West Bank (AP) -- Prime Minister Ehud Barak late Saturday
postponed a planned trip to Washington for a meeting with President Clinton
because of continued violence in southern Lebanon and the Palestinian areas. In
a statement released by his office, Barak said that the trip was being delayed,
but gave no alternate date. Barak's spokesman, Gadi Baltiansky, said it was
unlikely the prime minister would be able to travel later in the week. The
announcement followed a late night security Cabinet meeting in Tel Aviv.

The counterterrorism exercise called ''TOPOFF'' involved a simulated biological

   WEST ISLIP, N.Y. (AP) -- From the gym of his former high school on Long

into the nation's most-talked about political campaign -- the U.S. Senate race
against Hillary Rodham Clinton. ''You can tell from my accent that I am a
lifelong New Yorker,'' Lazio said in an obvious swipe at the first lady. ''I
don't have to fake it. ... I've never needed an exploratory committee to help me
figure out where I wanted to live.'' The official announcement, less than 24
hours after New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani dropped out of the Senate race,
launched the 42-year-old, four-term congressman into the national spotlight.

GOP Senator Blocks U.N. Money

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a foreign policy dispute with the Clinton
administration, a Republican senator who oversees State Department spending is
blocking the government from paying $368 million owed to the United Nations for
four peacekeeping missions. Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., believes it is unfair for
U.S. taxpayers to pay for part of the U.N. operations in Congo, Kosovo, East
Timor and Sierra Leone, a spokesman said today. The money originally was
intended for other purposes by the State Department, but later was set aside to
help pay for the peacekeeping efforts and therefore required Gregg's approval,
Edmund Amorosi said.

<HEADLINE> Peru President, Opponent Trade Barbs  </HEADLINE>
By RICK VECCHIO
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- In what may be the closest Peru comes to
holding a presidential debate, President Alberto Fujimori traded
barbs with upstart challenger Alejandro Toledo in back-to-back
radio interviews on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori accused Toledo of confusing voters and attempting to
destabilize Peru by calling for a general boycott of the May 28
runoff without officially withdrawing from the race.
</P>
<P>
   He reiterated that the vote would not be postponed, despite
mounting international pressure following an April 9 first-round
ballot marred by accusations of vote tampering and dirty tricks by
government forces.
</P>
<P>
   ''A clean election is my responsibility,'' Fujimori said during
a 45-minute interview on Radio Programas del Peru.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Organization of American States, the U.S. State
Department, and Toledo were not qualified to dictate a delay in the
election.
</P>
<P>
   A half-hour before Fujimori's interview, Toledo was on the same
station saying he would not participate in the scheduled vote. But
he said his party would continue campaigning ''against fraud and
seeking a new, reasonable date to allow the introduction of changes
for a clean election.''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations for a presidential debate were set to resume last
week, but fell by the wayside Thursday when the National Election
Board rejected Toledo's demand to push the runoff date back to June
18.
</P>
<P>
   Hours earlier, the OAS election delegation had also requested a
postponement, warning that it could not endorse the May 28 ballot
because there was insufficient time to test new vote-counting
software.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department spokesman said Friday that Washington
supported the OAS request for a delay, and regretted Toledo's
decision to withdraw, as well as the election board's ''hasty
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori said tabulating the upcoming vote would require little
more than a hand calculator because it only involved two
presidential candidates. The April 9 general election included nine
presidential hopefuls, as well as their congressional slates, for a
total of 1,627 candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The second round was set after Fujimori narrowly missed a
majority of votes necessary to claim an unprecedented third
five-year term. The final results showed that about 1 million more
ballots were cast than there were voters.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo said he planned to mobilize peaceful demonstrations
across the nation to pressure Fujimori into changing the date.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Toledo and Fujimori tied in voter preference. Tens of
thousands of people have rallied for both candidates, producing
several violent confrontations in recent days.

<HEADLINE> Deluge of Polls Expected in Future  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- The public will be inundated in the coming
months with political polls, some of which might make the
presidential campaign even tougher to understand, says a veteran
pollster, who partly blames the Monica Lewinsky scandal and the
24-hour news cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's clear that the shorter news cycle and the demand for
content'' are having a dramatic effect on the polling industry,
said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center for People
and the Press. ''Polls are being ordered up more quickly, being
done more quickly and they're being reported more quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   A poll taken over several days with thorough efforts to reach
possible respondents is more likely to give significant results
than a one-night poll produced under deadline pressure. Kohut
talked about the issue this weekend during the annual meeting of
the American Association for Public Opinion Research.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, Kohut cited an overnight poll done immediately
after Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., won the GOP primary in New
Hampshire. The poll that showed McCain essentially even with George
W. Bush in crucial South Carolina, site of the next contested
primary.
</P>
<P>
   Kohut said the poll ''created this notion'' that McCain was a
contender in an extremely tight race in South Carolina. Later polls
showed that the Texas governor held a comfortable lead in the
state, which he won easily.
</P>
<P>
   ''These polls conducted at breakneck speed on the heels of big
events where public opinion is distorted by the emotion of the
moment'' don't really inform the public, Kohut said. ''They are
used as a basis to underscore the narrative of the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollsters Gary Langer of ABC News and Kathleen Frankovic of CBS
News said that polling quickly after big events was often essential
for news operations. They agreed that their responsibility is to
continue polling in subsequent days and put the story in
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Kohut noted that public opinion during President Clinton's
impeachment scandal was pretty firm -- that the president should not
be removed from office. But the presidential race this year is
likely to be different, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not going to see that in 2000,'' he said of the
consistency of polls on impeachment. ''We're going to see lots of
polls at right angles to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Traugott, outgoing president of the pollsters' group,
called on his colleagues to establish more training for journalists
to reduce misinterpretation of polls in the media. This would
include holding more training panels for journalists and providing
contacts who could help reporters interpret poll data.
</P>
<P>
   The effort would expand on educational efforts by another
polling group, the National Council on Public Polls, which produced
a pamphlet outlining the questions a journalist should ask when
writing about a poll.

<HEADLINE> Tainted Feed Found in Belgium  </HEADLINE>
By RAF CASERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- One year after the dioxin crisis forced
the wholesale destruction of meat and dairy products, the
government shutdown 200 farms Saturday, hoping to prevent the
distribution of cancer-causing pollution in the food chain.
</P>
<P>
   Farm Minister Jaak Gabriels said 205 farms were under
investigation for taking fodder from a company where animal feed
contaminated with cancer-causing PCB was discovered. The pollution
was 925 times above the legal limit.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is very serious and we are doing our utmost to contain
the pollution,'' said Gabriels.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there were no indications contaminated meat had reached
consumers. ''The good thing is we were quick to react,'' reducing
chances it had spread far,'' said Gabriels.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, routine tests showed PCB in the fodder
company Bauduin-Cambier, in Feluy, 25 miles south of Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   PCB pollution has similar effects on human health as dioxin. The
dioxin scandal hit Belgium in May 1999, when the government
announced that high levels of the cancer-causing chemical had been
discovered in eggs, meat and dairy products.
</P>
<P>
   The fear led to a wide range of products being pulled from the
shelves, causing the biggest food safety scandal in Europe since
the 1996 Mad Cow crisis in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Belgian food was banned all over the world and exporters have
been trying to shore up confidence in Belgian exports ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Belgium instituted a series of control mechanisms to avoid a
repeat of the damaging crisis and Gabriels said the early warning
tests had been instrumental in containing the crisis. The
government said it had carried out some 3,000 tests on fodder
companies since last year's scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Of the affected farms, 147 raise cattle, 48 breed horses and 7
produce pigs. A poultry farm and two pet food producers make up the
total.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike last year, when Belgium was extremely slow in warning the
European Union it was faced with a dioxin crisis, Gabriels said his
services had already approached the EU headquarters with
information.

<HEADLINE> Experts focus on causes, cures for AIDS in black communities  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Stigma preventing frank discussion and
underfunded prevention programs are the main reasons AIDS continues
to infect African-Americans at epidemic levels, experts at a
three-day summit in Short Hills concluded Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of government and medical officials, politicians, clergy
and community activists who attended ''An Honest Perspective on
HIV/AIDS 2000'' in this Newark suburb first reached a consensus on
the roadblocks that have kept the medical community and social
service groups from reducing the virus' spread in black
communities.
</P>
<P>
   The experts devised strategies for attacking the problem,
including seeking help from churches and universities, lobbying for
more money to help community AIDS groups and getting doctors, peer
counselors and everyone else possible to encourage blacks to get
HIV screenings.
</P>
<P>
   ''To bring this cadre of people together in one room was worth
as much as any grant,'' because of all the information and ideas
shared, said Debra Fraser-Howe, president of the National Black
Leadership Commission on AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Conference co-moderator Dr. Beny Primm said assembling top
experts from so many fields to focus on the crisis was ''a
milestone.''
</P>
<P>
   While the number of new AIDS cases in this country each year is
ebbing, African-Americans make up a growing percentage of newly
diagnosed patients. Blacks comprised 61 percent of the HIV
infections reported in 1999 and 54 percent of those reported in
1998, according to conference sponsor Glaxo Wellcome, a drug
company that makes AIDS medications.
</P>
<P>
   ''What made this meeting unique is that now we'll see (the
pharmaceutical) industry working with government, industry working
with social service agencies ... in major cities with rates of HIV
that are high,'' said Primm, who is executive director of the
Brooklyn, N.Y.-based Addiction Research and Treatment Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The conference drew officials from federal health agencies such
as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the
Department of Health and Human Services, members of the
Congressional Black Caucus, representatives of national and local
AIDS advocacy and service groups, physicians and representatives of
Research Triangle Park, N.C.-based Glaxo Wellcome.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must foster public-private partnerships and bring together
multiple agencies such as (Housing and Urban Development), the
Department of Commerce, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the
Small Business Administration to redirect federal funding to the
communities that need it most,'' said Dr. Donna Christensen, who
also is the congresswoman representing the Virgin Islands.
</P>
<P>
   The conference, which focused on the AIDS epidemic in black
communities in the Northeast, also drew city officials from Boston,
New York, Newark, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, D.C.,
Wilmington, Del., Providence, R.I., and New Haven and Hartford, Ct.
</P>
<P>
   After a follow-up conference in a few months, when the same
officials and experts plan to discuss progress and develop
additional strategies, Primm expects future conferences in other
U.S. regions where AIDS patients may find even less support from
family, government and charities.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to become a nationwide effort,'' he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Among the goals set by the summit's participants:
</P>
<P>
   --getting African-American churches to help change attitudes
about AIDS;
</P>
<P>
   --fostering grass-roots projects that train social service
providers, peer counselors and other community members -- as well as
medical professionals -- to identify people at risk and persuade
them to be tested for HIV infection;
</P>
<P>
   --developing partnerships between community organizations and
universities;
</P>
<P>
   --helping community AIDS groups get the infrastructure support
they need to compete for and sustain government funding for their
services.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said stringent federal documentation requirements make
it hard for community groups, operating without professional grant
writers, attorneys and other key personnel, to get and keep federal
funding.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ability to provide the best services and the ability to
prove how well the service was delivered are not the same,'' said
Rashidah Hassan, a registered nurse and assistant director of
Circle of Care, a decade-old Philadelphia AIDS services group.
</P>
<P>
   Primm also said politicians and activists who attended plan to
lobby for changes in rules for receiving federal block grants for
AIDS programs so communities with a high AIDS infection rate can
apply even if the rest of their city or state has a lower rate.
Rules now are based on an entire state's infection rate.

<HEADLINE> Warehouse Owners Probed in Blast  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENSCHEDE, Netherlands (AP) -- A week after a fireworks blast
killed around 20 people in the Netherlands, police on Saturday
questioned the owners of the storage depot where the disaster
erupted.
</P>
<P>
   Both men turned themselves in after an international warrant was
issued for their arrest on Wednesday. Ruud Bakker was detained
Saturday afternoon, less than a day after co-owner Wilhelm Pater
reported to local authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are suspected of knowingly breaking regulations,'' said
Robert van der Hoeven of the Enschede public prosecutors office. If
found guilty, the men could be sentenced to six years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   They have not been charged with murder van der Hoeven said,
adding that investigators focused on ''the storage and manufacture

</P>
<P>
   Almost 1,000 people were injured on May 13 when 100 tons of
explosives went up in an enormous explosion that flattened a whole
working-class neighborhood in Enschede North.
</P>
<P>
   Forensics teams have identified 16 bodies, including four
firefighters and two young children. Six people are still missing
after 400 houses were destroyed in the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   Explosives experts are concerned illegal fireworks may have been
kept in unsafe conditions at S.E. Fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, 100,000 people took part in a silent procession
through the street of Enschede, 85 miles east of Amsterdam. Dutch
Crown Prince Willem Alexander, Prime Minister Wim Kok and Mayor Jan
Mans were among the masses who came from across the country to pay
their respects.

<HEADLINE> Lakers 109, Trail Blazers 94  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- This wasn't just ''Hack-a-Shaq.'' This was
''Hack-, hack-, hack-a-Shaq and keep on hacking.''
</P>
<P>
   And it didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal was 12-for-25 at the foul line in the fourth
quarter to shatter the playoff record for most attempts in a
quarter Saturday as the Los Angeles Lakers beat the Portland Trail
Blazers 109-94 in the opener of the Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, fouled virtually every time the Lakers had the ball in a
four-minute stretch that began with five minutes to go, finished
with 41 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists.
</P>
<P>
   ''It hasn't worked all year, and it ain't gonna work,'' O'Neal
said.
</P>
<P>
   He had had not scored more than 23 in any of his four games
against Portland in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal was 13-for-27 at the foul line, 12-for-24 in the final 5{
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The old record was 14 by Michael Jordan against Detroit on May
21, 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Lost in the bizarre free-throw parade was a magnificent second
quarter by the Lakers' bench that gave Los Angeles a 24-point lead
that was just too big for Portland to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Game 2 of the best-of-seven series is Monday night at the
Staples Center, where the Lakers are 7-0 in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' reserves, led by Robert Horry, scored 20 of the
team's 37 points in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Rice added 15 points for Los Angeles and Kobe Bryant had
13. Horry scored all 12 of his points in the second quarter,
including three 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Scottie Pippen led six Blazers in double figures with 19. Bonzi
Wells scored all 17 of his points in second half.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers led 81-57 when O'Neal made one of two free throws
with 3:22 left in the third quarter. But the Blazers, behind Wells,
went on a 19-6 run to cut it to 87-76 on Wells' inside basket with
10:06 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Detlef Schrempf's two free throws with five minutes to go cut it
to 97-88, but all the attention given to fouling O'Neal seemed to
take the Blazers' out of their offense. When Shaq hit his seventh
consecutive free throw with 3:52 to go, the Lakers led 104-89.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles took command with a 26-4 blitz to start the second
quarter and the Blazers never recovered. Horry's third 3-pointer of
the quarter capped the outburst and put the Lakers up 52-30 with
4:25 to play in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles stretched the lead to 24 twice before Steve Smith's
3-pointer at the halftime buzzer cut it to 63-42 at the break.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles's reserves were 7-for-9 from the field in the second
quarter, 5-for-6 on 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Rasheed Wallace, the Blazers' biggest offensive threat but
arguably the most hot-headed player in the NBA, was thrown out of
the game after drawing his second technical foul from referee Ron
Garretson with 6:43 left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   It was Wallace's seventh technical of the playoffs and first
ejection. In the regular-season, he was the NBA's runaway leader in
technicals with 38 and was ejected six times.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles was 8-for-12 on 3-pointers in the first half and
shot 59 percent from the field. The Blazers shot 53 percent and
still trailed by 21.
</P>
<P>
   Portland didn't shoot a free throw in the first half, while Los
Angeles was 7-for-9.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers outscored Los Angeles 15-4 over the last 3:07 of the
third quarter to cut the lead to 85-72 on Jermaine O'Neal's inside
basket just before the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
Notes: There was a moment of silence before the game because of
the death of Minnesota Timberwolves guard Malik Sealy in a car
accident early Saturday morning. ... The Lakers are 23-1 at home
since losing to Portland Jan. 22. In the only loss, April 5 against
San Antonio, O'Neal didn't play and the Lakers had just clinched
the homecourt advantage throughout the playoffs. ... No team has
beaten the Lakers twice on their homecourt this season. ... O'Neal
drew a technical foul from referee Bob Delaney as he walked off the
court at halftime. ... Portland's Arvydas Sabonis was 0-for-4 from
the field, didn't score and had one rebound. ... Among the
celebrities sighted, besides the ever-present Jack Nicholson, were
Dustin Hoffman, Will Smith, Denzel Washington, Edward Norton and
Selma Hayek, the latter two sitting together.

<HEADLINE> Colorado Defenseman Foote Practices  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MOSSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Colorado Avalanche defenseman Adam Foote, eager to
get back into action following an eye injury, practiced Saturday
but awaited medical clearance to resume playing.
</P>
<P>
   His right eye still bloodshot and the skin around his eye
discolored, Foote wore a half-length plastic face shield during the
workout, as opposed to the full-length shield he wore during a
skate-around Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Foote, Colorado's toughest defenseman, sustained what the club
called ''blunt trauma'' to his eye when he was hit by Jere
Lehtinen's stick in Game 2 of the Dallas-Colorado series Monday
night. He missed Game 3 on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Foote was to be evaluated by an ophthalmologist daily.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're going to let me play when they feel I'm 100 percent,''
he said. ''The doctors aren't going to let me out there if they
feel I can reinjure or aggravate it. So I have to be patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Foote, however, was finding that difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel great,'' he said. ''Today was a good skate for me. I
want to play. I wanted to play last night. I felt I could have
played four days ago.''
</P>
<P>
   He said wearing the shield wasn't a problem, although some
players complain that it affects their vision.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've played with one before, about five or six years ago,'' he
said. ''The visor is not going to bother me.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado coach Bob Hartley said the club's medical staff ''will
make the final decision. Footie wanted to play last night. Knowing
him, he wants to play every game. But we have to do what's best for
him. When dealing with an eye injury, there's no sense taking any
chances.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel very confident that he is going to be in the lineup at
some point in this series, but for (Sunday) we still don't know.''

<HEADLINE> Twins 3, Athletics 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Eric Milton pitched three-hit ball for
eight innings and the Minnesota Twins beat the Oakland Athletics
3-0 Saturday for their third straight victory.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's Brian Buchanan had three hits in his second major
league game. The Athletics lost their fifth in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Denny Hocking went 3-for-3 with a double. He is 9-for-13 in the
first three games of the four-game series.
</P>
<P>
   Milton (3-1) struck out seven and walked two. Eddie Guardado
finished with a perfect ninth for his second save.
</P>
<P>
   Milton allowed a first-inning single to Jason Giambi, then
didn't allow another hit until Ramon Hernandez led off the sixth
with a single. Giambi later got Oakland's other hit.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Mulder (2-1) lost for the first time in seven career starts
after allowing three runs -- one earned -- on seven hits in seven
innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins scored three times in the second inning, helped by
Mulder's wild throw.
</P>
<P>
   Matt LeCroy doubled home the first run and Jay Canizaro hit
one-out comebacker. Mulder trapped LeCroy between second and third,
but made a wild throw that let a run score and Canizaro advance to
third.
</P>
<P>
   Hocking drove in Canizaro with a single.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Athletics DH John Jaha, on the disabled list since April
24, is expected to go on a rehab assignment Monday. ... Milton had
allowed six home runs and 18 earned runs in his previous 12 1-3
innings in May. ... Twins RHP LaTroy Hawkins has not allowed a run
in eight of his last nine appearances and has a 0.59 ERA in that
span. ... Matt Stairs is hitting .081 (3-for-37) against
left-handers this season, worst in the majors.

<HEADLINE> Bailey Takes Red Bullet To Victory  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Like almost everyone else at Pimlico, Jerry
Bailey kept an eye on 1-5 favorite Fusaichi Pegasus throughout most
of the 125th Preakness Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of Saturday's race, however, Bailey had nothing
to look at except the finish line. All the other horses, including
Fusaichi Pegasus, were in his wake.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey, back aboard Red Bullet for the first time since
February, breezed past the pack down the stretch and cruised to a
surprising victory, defeating the Kentucky Derby winner by 3 3-4
lengths.
</P>
<P>
   ''My biggest concern was to get the jump on Fusaichi Pegasus,''
Bailey said. ''I was inside of him and I felt if we could beat him
to the quarter pole, we could beat him to the wire.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's exactly what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Red Bullet and Bailey parted company when Bailey decided to run
in California, but the horse and jockey got back together for the
Preakness and teamed to win the $1 million race as a 6-1 underdog.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we met Jerry down at the saddling area, I said, 'The less
we tell you Jerry, the better it is,''' owner Frank Stronach said.
''I was glad to see him sit way back, because basically I would
have loved to have told him to stay back, watch Pegasus and then
just rush by him.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is precisely how Bailey won the race.
</P>
<P>
   ''We knew Jerry could get the job done,'' trainer Joe Orseno
said.
</P>
<P>
   Red Bullet was seventh at the half-pole and sixth at the 3-4
pole, but blasted past the pack to move into first at the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ''The race set up nice for us. We wanted to be mid-pack, and
that's exactly where we were able to get,'' Bailey said. ''It
turned out great.''
</P>
<P>
   As he burst toward the finish, Red Bullet splattered mud on
Fusaichi Pegasus as he pulled away.
</P>
<P>
   ''Red Bullet really showed what he was made of today,'' Bailey
said. ''He exploded on the turn and when we straightened out, he
just left the other horses. He was just the better horse today.''

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Party Activities Frozen  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- The government on Saturday froze the
activities of an Islamic-oriented party in reaction to a recent
leadership split within the organization, judicial officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Two senior members of the Labor Party -- which is blamed for
recent student riots -- split from the group Tuesday, denouncing
party leader Ibrahim Shukri and each claiming to be the new leader.
</P>
<P>
   The Political Parties Committee, a government body that licenses
political groups, said Saturday it does not recognize any of the
three men claiming to lead the Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
   Hamdi Ahmed, a movie actor and a member of the party's Central
Committee, and Ahmed Idriss, also on the 14-member committee, were
chosen in separate rallies to replace Shukri, who has led the party
since its establishment in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed and Idriss have accused Shukri and Labor Party
Secretary-General Adel Hussein of turning the party into an Islamic
fundamentalist group and inciting sedition.
</P>
<P>
   The committee on Saturday referred the party to a public
prosecutor, who will investigate the sedition charges, as well as
allegations of financial and administrative irregularities. The
prosecutor also will decide whether the party should be banned.
</P>
<P>
   The party should resolve the leadership problem itself, the
committee said, or take the question to court, the judicial
officials said on condition their names not be used.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein told Qatar's Al-Jazeera Television on Saturday that the
committee's action against the party -- including the closing of its
newspaper -- was illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The government has been considering a ban on the party and its
newspaper, Al-Shaab, since a May 5 article in the party journal
prompted two days of student riots. The article said a book
approved by the Culture Ministry for publication in Egypt was
blasphemous.
</P>
<P>
   On May 7 and 8, hundreds of Muslim students demonstrated against
the book, clashing with police. At least 40 students and six
policemen were injured in the riots. Police arrested 75 students.
</P>
<P>
   Culture Ministry officials said the 1983 book, ''Banquet for
Seaweed,'' by Syrian author Haider Haider, was reprinted as part of
a series of classics of Arabic literature. Literary experts
appointed by the ministry have said the novel does not defame
religion.

   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Here are some highlights of the final
document adopted by the 187 parties to the Nuclear Nonproliferation
Treaty at the end of a four-week conference on Saturday:
</P>
<P>
   --An ''unequivocal undertaking by the nuclear-weapon states to

to nuclear disarmament.''
</P>
<P>
   --Increased transparency by the nuclear powers on reporting
information about their nuclear arsenals.

</P>
<P>
   --Permanently and irreversibly removing plutonium and uranium

<HEADLINE> Americans Polled on Clinton Support  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two-thirds of Americans think President
Clinton would run for office again if he could, but only a third
believe he would win, said a poll released Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's biggest achievements during his term in office have
been the strong economy and deficit reduction, according to the
CBS-New York Times poll released Saturday. While Clinton's job
approval remains at six of 10 Americans, even though only a fourth
of the public feel he has honesty and integrity. The president is
constitutionally barred from seeking office for a third term.
</P>
<P>
   Four of 10 said they would consider voting for him if he ran
again, the poll suggested. About the same number said in the poll
that they support Vice President Al Gore, the presumptive
Democratic presidential nominee. Gore was slightly behind
Republican rival George W. Bush in head-to-head results released
earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   Americans thought Clinton combines the best qualities of Bush
and Gore. Clinton has the same ratings on leadership as Bush and
the same ratings as Gore for caring about people. But his ratings
on honesty and integrity were significantly below both; one-fourth
said Clinton could be trusted, while four in 10 said that of Bush
and of Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone poll was conducted May 10-13 among 947 adults and
has an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Diego Serna and Roy Lassiter scored
goals six minutes apart in the first half to lead the Miami Fusion
to a 2-0 victory over the Colorado Rapids on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Miami goalkeeper Nick Rimando, a 20-year-old rookie, had five
saves for his second shutout in three starts.
</P>
<P>
   The Fusion (4-3-4) improved to 3-0 under interim head coach Ray
Hudson, who took over May 8, and remained atop the Eastern
Division. Colorado dropped to 5-7.
</P>
<P>
   The Rapids' best scoring threat of the second half was Henry
Zambrano's shot that a diving Rimando stopped in the 69th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Serna gave the Fusion a 1-0 lead in the 19th minute with his
third goal of the season. After receiving a long pass from Martin
Machon on the right wing, Serna dribbled inside the penalty box and
drilled an 18-yard shot past Colorado goalkeeper Adin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Lassiter scored his third goal with a 6-yard shot in the 25th
minute.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Economy Grows .3 Percent  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- A key economic indicator
showed
Venezuela moving out of its worst recession in a decade.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Venezuela's gross domestic product grew .3 percent in the first
quarter versus the same period last year, according to Central Bank
figures. Gross domestic product is the total value of goods and
services produced locally in a nation.
</P>
<P>
   The private sector grew by 1.8 percent in the first quarter of
this year, offsetting a 1.9 percent contraction in the public
sector.
</P>
<P>
   The oil-dependent economy had been mired in a deep recession
since the third quarter of 1998 when GDP shrank by 5.3 percent,
initiating eight quarters of consecutive contractions. In 1999, GDP
plunged 7.2 percent, the worst drop since 1989, despite soaring oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
   The recession resulted in the loss of 600,000 jobs last year and
the closing of 1,000 industrial companies.
</P>
<P>
   Critics blamed last year's economic contraction on President
Hugo Chavez' aggressive antibusiness rhetoric and political
uncertainty due to a change of constitutions, two factors they say
alienated private investors.
</P>
<P>
   News of economic growth comes just one week before a
presidential election, in which Chavez is seeking re-election. The
charismatic president remains widely popular among the country's
poor masses and is expected to win the vote handily, despite last
year's recession.
</P>
<P>
   The first quarter growth contradicted economists' predictions of
a 2 percent drop.

<HEADLINE> Kidnapped Boy Released After 4 Days  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- The eight-year old son of a wealthy
ethnic Albanian was released unharmed Saturday, four days after he
was seized on his way to school by a Yugoslav-based kidnapping
ring.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Kuvet Salahi was freed near the central Swiss town
of Lucerne after an unprecedented joint operation between Swiss and
Serbian police. A $700,000 ransom, flown to Belgrade on Friday, was
fully recovered by Serbian authorities.
</P>
<P>
   One man was arrested in Switzerland and two more in Serbia.
Police launched a search for four more.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was thrown into a car trunk as he made his way to school
in Zurich on Tuesday. It sent the closely-knit ethnic Albanian
community into shock, especially because the boy's father, Bedzet
Salahi, was a well-known figure thanks to his network of travel
companies and his support for the Kosovo Albanian cause.
</P>
<P>
   Zurich police official Peter Ruegger said the kidnappers had
phoned the Salahi family from Serbia and demanded that the ransom
be sent there. The money was flown to Belgrade on Friday and then
taken on to a contact point, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the early hours of Saturday, Serbian police arrested two men,
who subsequently provided Kuvet's whereabouts in Switzerland, said
Ruegger. The boy was reunited with his family.

<HEADLINE> Sorenstam, Burton Lead Firstar Golf  </HEADLINE>
By RUSTY MILLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEAVERCREEK, Ohio (AP) -- Annika Sorenstam and Brandie Burton
pulled away from a crowded leaderboard with 7-under-par 65s
Saturday to share the lead heading into the final round of the
Firstar LPGA Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Mi Hyun Kim and Karrie Webb, Sorenstam and Burton
jousted for and traded the lead all day. Eight combinations of the
foursome led at one point or another, with only Kim and Burton
holding the lead by themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam and Burton, each of whom shot 66 in the opening round
at the Country Club of the North, now stand at 13-under 131,
matching the tournament record set by Meg Mallon two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   After a 69, first-round leader Kim was alone in second at 12
under, followed by Webb, who was another shot back after two late
bogeys left her with a 68.
</P>
<P>
   The top four flirted with the LPGA record for lowest 36-hole
score in relation to par. Each had gotten to 12 under with six
holes remaining, but weren't unable to threaten Michelle McGann's
mark of 16 under through the first two rounds of the 1999 Sara Lee
Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam climbed into a tie for the lead with Webb and Kim by
birdieing the par-5 15th after chipping to 8 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Kim then bogeyed the next hole, hooking a 7-iron left of the
green and then missing a 4-foot par putt. Webb dropped back with
consecutive bogeys at the 16th and 17th holes, both times failing
to get up and down after missing the green with a middle-iron
approach.
</P>
<P>
   Burton pulled even with Sorenstam by holing a 20-footer for
birdie at the 17th.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam hasn't had a bogey, piling up 13 birdies and 23 pars.
Her seven birdies included a near ace on the 149-yard eighth hole,
with her 8-iron shot stopping two inches from the cup. Playing to
the crowd, she pretended to plumb-bob the tap-in.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam is seeking her second win of the season and 20th of
her seven-year professional career.
</P>
<P>
   Burton, a winner of two major championships, missed all of the
1999 season after shoulder surgery, the latest in a series of
maladies she's overcome. She's also had jaw surgery three times and
suffered a rib injury in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   She took sole possession of the lead with a run of three
straight birdies starting at the sixth. Her only slip came at the
par-4 12th, where she three-putted from the front edge of the
green.
</P>
<P>
   The only other player in double figures under par was Christie
Kerr -- and she had to hole a 158-yard 6-iron on the final hole. She
raised her arms and jumped in the air after the ball took three
bounces and dropped into the cup, closing out a 66 that put her at
10-under 134.
</P>
<P>
   Webb has been the hottest player in women's golf this year with
victories on the LPGA tour and two non-tour events.

<HEADLINE> Hal's Hope Slowed By Slick Track  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Hal's Hope looked hopeless in the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   Running on a slick track for the first time, Hal's Hope faded
badly and finished last in the eight-horse field Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hal really didn't run his race,'' said 88-year-old owner
Harold Rose. ''He had never run on an off-track before. There's
nothing physically wrong with him. He just needs some rest after
running in three races in five weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Hal's Hope was coming off a 16th-place finish in the Kentucky
Derby. The race before that, he took eighth in the Blue Grass in
Keeneland.
</P>
<P>
   Rose hoped his horse would rebound in the Preakness, but it just
didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   ''He broke good, but when he wasn't right there with the leaders
as they went into the first turn I knew he wasn't handling the
track well,'' Rose said.
</P>
<P>
   Jockey Roger Velez said, ''He's a tired horse. He has a lot of
nicks and needs a little time off.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   NO PROBLEMS: Chilly temperatures and additional security outside
the infield combined to make this Preakness day a hassle-free event
for Pimlico Race Course.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the excessive use of air conditioners in the
neighborhood surrounding the track caused a power outage that
closed dozens of betting windows and darkened a portion of the
grandstand. Last year, a fan ran from the infield onto the track
and tried to punch a horse.
</P>
<P>
   The cool weather, in addition to a new emergency generator,
ensured that there would be no power overload at Pimlico.
</P>
<P>
   And the track at least a dozen extra security guards to watch
the fence surrounding the infield, just in case someone attempted
to become a copycat gatecrasher.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are to stop anybody by any means possible,'' said Scott
Durbin, who was assigned the spot where the security breach
occurred last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we're going to be OK. We've got guys positioned at
every 50 feet or so,'' Durbin said. ''Plus, the cold weather will
probably keep the drinking down.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   CHILLIN' NEIMAN: LeRoy Neiman, the official artist of the 125th
Preakness, carried on the tradition of painting the winning colors
of the horse and jockey on the weather vane near the winner's
circle immediately after the race.
</P>
<P>
   It sounded like a good idea early in the week, but the soggy
conditions threatened to make the colors run faster than the horse
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for Neiman, the rain stopped well before the race, and
he went about his chore with great delight.
</P>
<P>
   The tradition of applying the colors to the weather vane
following the Preakness began in 1909.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   HEF FADES TO SIXTH: The muddy track Saturday gave hope to long
shot Hugh Hefner, who was bidding to pull off the biggest upset in
the history of the event.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Hefner, a 45-1 shot, would have paid more than the $48.80
Master Derby returned in 1975. But Hugh Hefner dropped out of
contention and finished sixth after holding the lead at the 3-4
pole.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a tough race, and we weren't embarrassed,'' trainer
Marty Jones said. ''The track was sticky. It didn't play like the
usual Pimlico track, and speed didn't carry.''
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Hefner, the person, did not attend the event Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   STREAK ENDS: Kent Desormeaux was on roll, having won the
Kentucky Derby, Pimlico Special and Black-Eyed Susan Stakes in a
span of 14 days.
</P>
<P>
   His luck ran out Saturday, when he took second in the Preakness
behind Red Bullet.
</P>
<P>
   ''The track was a little greasy today. It might have made a
difference,'' Desormeaux said. ''Red Bullet and I were right
together all the way down the backside. We pushed the button at the
same time, but Red Bullet had a bigger button. He just ran wild.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   BELMONT POSSIBLES: Now that the Preakness is over, it's time to
look ahead to the June 10 Belmost Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   If Fusaichi Pegasus and Red Bullet emerged from Saturday's race
in good condition, they will compete. Kentucky Derby runner-up
Aptitude is also considering the trip to New York, as is Wheelaway,
who finished third in the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Other possibles include: Tahkodha Hills, Unshaded, Chief
Seattle, Curule and Globalize.

<HEADLINE> Mets 8, Diamondbacks 7  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH DUBOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mike Hampton made the wait worthwhile for the
few Mets fans who stuck around Shea Stadium through a 3-hour,
31-minute rain delay.
</P>
<P>
   Unaffected by the later start, Hampton pitched six scoreless
innings and hit a two-run single as the New York Mets held off the
Arizona Diamondbacks 8-7 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona rallied for five runs in the ninth, capped by Kelly
Stinnett's two-out, two-run single off John Franco. Armando Benitez
relieved with runners at first and second and struck out
pinch-hitter Erubiel Durazo for his 11th save.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have won three straight games for the first time since
their nine-game winning streak ended April 25. Along with seeing a
win, the home fans who weathered the delay were given a free ticket
to a later game.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks committed four errors and have lost five of six
games following a nine-game winning streak. They have lost four
straight games in Shea Stadium, including two in last year's
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   After a disastrous start to his New York career, Hampton (5-4)
has finally started pitching like the ace the Mets thought they
acquired from Houston last winter.
</P>
<P>
   The left-hander has allowed only one run in 23 1-3 innings in
his last three starts, lowering his ERA from 6.52 to 4.21. He
allowed four hits and one walk Saturday before leaving with
tightness in his upper back.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton was also in the middle of two Mets' scoring rallies.
After Rey Ordonez led off the third inning with a single off Omar
Daal (1-5), Hampton laid down a bunt. Daal barehanded the ball,
wheeled and threw high to second base for an error.
</P>
<P>
   After a sacrifice bunt by Joe McEwing, Derek Bell hit an infield
single to score the first run of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets broke the game open with five runs in the fourth. Benny
Agbayani, Jay Payton and Ordonez hit one-out singles to load the
bases. Payton's hit snapped an 0-for-23 slump.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton then reached out and lined a single to center to make it
3-0. The Mets added three more runs on an error by second baseman
Jay Bell, another RBI single by Bell and a sacrifice fly by Edgardo
Alfonzo.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo added a two-run homer in the seventh inning off Greg
Swindell.
</P>
<P>
   After the lengthy rain delay before the start of the game, fewer
than 10,000 fans were left from the paid crowd of 37,121. Hampton
came out firing strikes -- something he had trouble doing early this
season -- throwing 13 straight to start the game.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton had spotless control all day, throwing 57 of 79 pitches
for strikes. After the Mets went ahead 6-0 in the fourth inning, he
needed only 18 pitches to work through his final two innings.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Colbrunn hit a two-run homer in the eighth off Pat Mahomes.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the rain delay, fans from the game could get free
tickets to an additional game on June 20 or 21 against
Philadelphia, or June 26 or 27 against Florida.
Notes: Hampton, who walked 36 batters in his first 38 2-3 innings,
has allowed only two walks in his last 23 1-3 innings. ... Daal
allowed six runs -- four earned -- and eight hits in 3 1-3 innings.
... The Diamondbacks are 3-5 on their nine-game road trip, losing
one of three in San Diego, two of three in Montreal and the first
two in New York. Their last losing road trip came from June 29-July
5 last season when they went 2-5 on a trip to Cincinnati and St.
Louis. ... Arizona's Tony Womack singled in the sixth inning to tie
his career high with a 16-game hitting streak. ... Arizona OF Steve
Finley was scratched after being hit on the right elbow by a pitch
Friday. Travis Lee got his first career start in center field and
made a two-base error in the seventh inning.

<HEADLINE> Experts Focus on AIDS Causes, Cures  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- AIDS is spreading faster among blacks
because prevention programs are underfunded and lingering stigmas
about the disease prevent frank discussions, experts at a three-day
summit on the subject concluded Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of government and medical officials, clergy and community
activists attended ''An Honest Perspective on HIV/AIDS 2000'' in
Short Hills, a Newark suburb.
</P>
<P>
   The experts devised strategies for attacking what they called an
epidemic among blacks, including seeking help from churches and
universities, lobbying for more money for community AIDS groups and
increasing efforts to encourage blacks to get HIV screenings.
</P>
<P>
   ''To bring this cadre of people together in one room was worth
as much as any grant,'' because of all the information and ideas
shared, said Debra Fraser-Howe, president of the National Black
Leadership Commission on AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   While the number of new AIDS cases in this country each year is
ebbing, blacks make up a growing percentage of newly diagnosed
patients. Blacks comprised 61 percent of the HIV infections
reported in 1999 and 54 percent in 1998, according to conference
sponsor Glaxo Wellcome, a drug company that makes AIDS medications.
</P>
<P>
   Conference participants said honest discussions about AIDS are
often difficult in the black community because many people still
consider it a disease of gay white men, prostitutes and intravenous
drug users.
</P>
<P>
   With that and other problems in mind, experts at the summit set
several goals:
</P>
<P>
   --Getting African-American churches to help change attitudes
about AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   --Fostering grass-roots projects that train social service
providers, peer counselors and other community members to identify
people at risk and persuade them to be tested for HIV infection;
</P>
<P>
   --Helping support community AIDS groups that need to compete for
and sustain government funding for their services. Experts said
stringent federal documentation requirements make it hard for
community groups, operating without professional grant writers and
attorneys, to get and keep federal funding.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ability to provide the best services and the ability to
prove how well the service was delivered are not the same,'' said
Rashidah Hassan, a registered nurse and assistant director of
Circle of Care, a Philadelphia AIDS services group.
</P>
<P>
   Conference co-moderator Dr. Beny Primm said politicians and
activists who attended plan to lobby for changes in the rules for
federal block grants to AIDS programs. That would let communities
with high AIDS rates apply even if the rest of their city or state
has a lower rate. Rules now are based on an entire state's
infection rate.
</P>
<P>
   At a follow-up conference in a few months, the same officials
and experts plan to discuss progress and develop new strategies.
Primm, executive director of the New York-based Addiction Research
and Treatment Corp., also expects future conferences in other
regions of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to become a nationwide effort,'' he said.

NRA's Heston Lashes Out at Gore
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Charlton Heston told more than 5,000 National Rifle
Association members today that he wants to serve an unprecedented third term as
their president to complete a mission: ensuring Al Gore's defeat in November.
''George Washington hung around until the Revolutionary War was won,'' he said.
''Roosevelt hung around until the world war was won. Reagan hung around until
the Cold War was won. If you want, I'll hang around until we win this one,
too.'' Heston said the nation's gun owners are at grave risk of losing their
Second Amendment right to bear arms if Gore wins the presidency.

Americans Polled on Clinton Support

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two-thirds of Americans think President Clinton would run
for office again if he could, but only a third believe he would win, said a poll
released today. Clinton's biggest achievements during his term in office have
been the strong economy and deficit reduction, according to the CBS-New York
Times poll released today. Clinton's job approval remains at six of 10
Americans, even though only a fourth of the public feel he has honesty and
integrity. The president is constitutionally barred from seeking office for a
third term.

Galileo Probe Zooms by Jupiter Moon

   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- NASA's Galileo spacecraft zoomed by Jupiter's
largest moon early today, taking new measurements of Ganymede's magnetic field
and images of the surface. The $1.4 billion probe flew within 502 miles of the
moon -- roughly the distance between San Francisco and San Diego -- at about 4
a.m., said Jim Erickson, Galileo's project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory. Galileo's Fields and Particles experiments are taking readings of
the magnetic field around Ganymede, the only moon known to have its own. They
will be compared with those taken by the Cassini probe when it flies by in
December on its way to Saturn.

because of continued violence in southern Lebanon and the Palestinian areas. In
a statement released by his office, Barak said that the trip was being delayed,
but gave no alternate date. Barak's spokesman, Gadi Baltiansky, said it was
unlikely the prime minister would be able to travel later in the week. The

downloads. Golin/Harris International, which has 13 offices in eight states and
three countries, told its employees via e-mail Tuesday that Napster is

Red Bullet Wins the Preakness
</SUBHEAD>

   BALTIMORE (AP) -- With the finish line as a target, Jerry Bailey scored a
bull's-eye with Red Bullet in the Preakness today, upsetting Kentucky Derby
winner Fusaichi Pegasus. Red Bullet, who had finished second to Fusaichi Pegasus
April 15 in the Wood Memorial, took the lead from High Yield in the upper
stretch. Once he got the lead, the outcome was never in doubt. Fusaichi Pegasus
went off as the 1-5 favorite and was the first Derby winner to be favored in the
Preakness since 1994. The last odds-on favorite to win the race was Spectacular
Bid, who scored at 1-10 in 1979.

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays 4, Mariners 3  </HEADLINE>
By JIM COUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Rickey Henderson hit a home run in his first
at-bat for Seattle, but the Tampa Bay Devil Rays stopped their
six-game losing streak Saturday with a fight-interrupted, 4-3 win
over the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, who made his Mariners debut as a pinch-runner the
previous night, hit his major league-record 76th leadoff home run.
Signed Wednesday night after being released by the Mets, he went
1-for-3 with two walks.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle trailed 4-2 in the seventh when Mark McLemore charged
the mound and tackled Tampa Bay starter Esteban Yan (2-1) after an
inside pitch. Plate umpire Bill Welke called time as Yan was
delivering, which might have thrown off the pitch. McLemore was
unaware that time was called.
</P>
<P>
   Players from both benches and dugouts emptied onto the field and
there was about a five-minute melee at the mound. Yan and McLemore
were ejected, as was Mariners reliever Arthur Rhodes. The skirmish
interrupted play for about 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth, players came back on the field when Mike DiFelice
of Tampa Bay squared to bunt and Jose Paniagua's pitch was inside.
DiFelice fouled it off and first base coach Jose Cardenal ran in to
stop DiFelice from going out to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle had its season-high four-game winning streak stopped.
Despite allowing a run in the eighth on consecutive doubles by John
Olerud and Edgar Martinez, Roberto Hernandez pitched the final two
innings for his third save.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson made his first at-bat in a Mariners uniform a
memorable one. He hit a 1-1 pitch 366 feet to left field for his
279th career homer, and the Safeco Field crowd of 40,665 cheered
wildly for Seattle's new hero.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson arrived in Seattle on Friday night and scoring the
tying run in the eighth inning of a 7-6 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay scored twice in the seventh off Rob Ramsay (0-1) and
Paniagua for a 4-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   With one out, Kevin Stocker walked and Miguel Cairo singled.
Williams hit an RBI single that Henderson misplayed in left field
for an error, and Fred McGriff later walked with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays scored twice in the third to take a 2-1 lead.
Vinny Castilla singled home a run and Greg Vaughn had an RBI
grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Rodriguez hit his 15th home run for Seattle, extending his
hitting streak to 15 games.
Notes: Henderson hit his first leadoff homer since last July 18
when he homered for the Mets off Juan Guzman in Baltimore. He had
two leadoff homers last season for the Mets. ... It was the
Mariners' 25th leadoff homer and the second this season. Mike
Cameron did it May 9 in Texas.

<HEADLINE> Cink Takes Colonial Golf Lead  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN HAWKINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Playing extra holes Saturday in the
Colonial seemed to help Stewart Cink, who took over the lead with
two impressive strings of birdies.
</P>
<P>
   Cink was 10 under for the 31 holes he played, moving to 11 under
and three strokes ahead of Davis Love III, who had five birdies and
four bogeys in his third round of 1-under 69.
</P>
<P>
   Forced to play the final 13 holes of his rain-delayed second
round Saturday morning, Cink carded five straight birdies for a 64
to move within a stroke of co-leaders Love and David Toms.
</P>
<P>
   ''That never hurts you confidence, it only helps,'' Cink said of
his birdie stretch from Nos. 2-6. ''It is always nice to go out and
get a good feel for the course. I was just aiming at the hole and
the hole looked so big.''
</P>
<P>
   And that feeling carried over into his afternoon round with Love
and Toms.
</P>
<P>
   Cink had four birdies over a six-hole stretch -- Nos. 7-12. He
took over the lead with a long birdie putt at the 402-yard 9th,
which he followed with birdies at the 404-yard 10th and the
433-yard 12th. He had just one bogey in his third-round 65.
</P>
<P>
   Cink, who won the MCI Classic last month, will try Sunday to
join Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson, Hal Sutton and Jesper Parnevik as
multiple winners on the PGA Tour this season.
</P>
<P>
   Love will try to avoid his eighth second-place finish since he
his last victory -- at the 1998 MCI Classic 47 tournaments ago. Love
and Mickelson lost in a playoff with Parnevik last week in the
Byron Nelson Classic.
</P>
<P>
   After a third-round 67, Scott Dunlap was alone in third at
7-under 203. Among a quartet at 204 was Fred Couples, who made an
early charge before being shaken up by a wayward tee shot that hit
a woman on the head.
</P>
<P>
   When Cink sank his birdie putt to get to 7 under at the 7th, he
was a stroke behind Toms, who went to 8 under when his putt circled
the cup and dropped for his second straight birdie. But Toms then
went the wrong way, with four bogeys over the next six holes.
</P>
<P>
   Toms played 32 holes Saturday. He was 4 under for his last 14
second-round holes to complete a 66 that put him in the lead with
Love after two rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Love only had to play 18 holes Saturday. He was able to complete
his second-round 66 before the first of two weather suspensions
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Love and Toms both birdied the opening hole of the third round,
and matched stroke-for-stroke through the first six holes. Both had
bogeys at the 476-yard 3rd and 470-yard 5th, the two longest par 4s
at Colonial Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   At No. 5, Love lipped out his par while Toms actually did a nice
job to salvage a bogey. After his approach buried into the upslope
of the bunker, Toms couldn't get the ball out on his first attempt,
but it rolled back into a better position in the sand and he then
blasted within 5 feet of the pin.
</P>
<P>
   After three birdies his first six holes, Couples was at 7 under
and sharing the lead. Then his tee shot on the 7th hole disappeared
into the trees, bouncing back into the fairway after hitting a
woman on the head.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared to be a lucky break, but Couples was obviously
shaken after going to the gallery and speaking briefly to the
woman, bleeding from a gash on her head as she laid on the ground.
Couples then hit his approach shot into the bunker and ended with a
bogey.
</P>
<P>
   While the woman, who never lost consciousness, went to get
stitches, the momentum Couples had built was ripped away. After the
bogey at No. 7, he finished his round with 11 straight pars and a
68.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to say it was a cause for the bogey, but I was
thinking about it on the second shot, on the chip shot and on the
putt, but I also thought about it on a lot of other holes,''
Couples said. ''I couldn't just shake that off. The fact that she
was cut needed stitches, it's not a good feeling.''
</P>
<P>
Divots: Defending champion Olin Browne missed the cut by a stroke
with a 144 total. Ben Hogan, whose imposing statue is at the
clubhouse entrance, is the only player to ever win consecutive
Colonials, the first two in 1946-47 and then again in 1952-53. ...
Stuart Appleby had a hole-in-one on the 178-yard 13th hole.

<HEADLINE> Wallace, Sabonis Vanish For Blazers  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- They went about it in different ways, but
Rasheed Wallace and Arvydas Sabonis both disappeared at the worst
possible time for the Portland Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, who led the NBA in technical fouls with a record 38 in
the regular season, was ejected in the third quarter of Portland's
109-94 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It definitely hurt us,'' Detlef Schrempf said. ''We need him
to be a threat for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabonis stayed around to the end, but had no points and one
rebound in 33 minutes, depriving the Blazers of his much-needed
outside shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Their ineffectiveness, coupled with the Blazers being outscored
37-16 in the second quarter, turned the game into a rout after both
teams played evenly in the first 12 minutes of the Western
Conference finals opener.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now we'll just be happy to get out of this building.
Forget about the way we played,'' Scottie Pippen said.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Wallace didn't get tossed for displaying his usual
fiery temperament. But him staring daggers at referee Ron Garretson
spoke volumes.
</P>
<P>
   Garretson, who whistled the first technical when Wallace was out
of the game sitting on the floor in the second period, ejected
Wallace at 6:43 of the third period. Moments before, Wallace had
received a delay of game warning at the free-throw line.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Smith ran up in protest, but Garretson, who was miked for
the TV telecast, explained that he twice told Blazers coach Mike
Dunleavy that Wallace should ''stop staring and trying to
intimidate me. If he does it again, he's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Rasheed didn't say anything and he just stared at him,'' Smith
said. ''He (Garretson) asked him not to stare at him and then he
gave him a tech.''
</P>
<P>
   A smiling Wallace didn't want to talk later.
</P>
<P>
   ''I ain't giving you all fuel for the fire,'' he said. ''I ain't
saying nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Grant expressed surprise that a player could earn a
technical for not speaking.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a first. I never heard of that before,'' he said.
''We'll be more conscious of the way we look at the refs.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen defended Wallace, saying he's treated differently by the
referees.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't think a lot of times it's Rasheed's fault. The
officials take it kind of harsh because of the way that he speaks,
but he's not going to change the way that he speaks,'' Pippen said.
''When he talks to you, he talks with an aggression.
</P>
<P>
   ''They tend to be a little bit more aggressive at giving him a
technical more so than a lot of other guys in the league. It's the
way Rasheed talks sometimes that gets him in trouble rather than
what he says,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dunleavy was less understanding about getting 16 minutes out of
Wallace rather than his average of 35 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't have an All-Star sitting in the locker room half the
game,'' he said. ''At some point, he has to understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace finished with 11 points and three rebounds -- off his
averages of 16.4 points and seven rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Sabonis, a 7-foot-3, 282-pounder who averaged 11.8 points and
7.8 rebounds in the regular season, came up with nearly nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sabs can't give us those type of numbers. He wasn't as
aggressive as he usually is,'' said Bonzi Wells, who had 17 points
off the bench. ''If we get him going, then everyone else will be
get aggressive.''

<HEADLINE> Mariners-Tampa Bay Players Scuffle  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Mark McLemore of the Seattle Mariners charged the
mound and tackled Tampa Bay pitcher Esteban Yan after the
right-hander came inside with a pitch in the seventh inning
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Players from both teams left the dugouts and bullpens to join in
the melee before the umpires restored order. There was scuffling on
the mound before McLemore and Yan were separated.
</P>
<P>
   McLemore was ejected, along with Mariners reliever Arthur
Rhodes. McLemore had to be restrained by teammates from coming back
on the field after he was thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners announced Yan had been ejected, but he was not.
</P>
<P>
   The count was 2-1 to McLemore when the melee began. The skirmish
interrupted the game about 15 minutes.

<HEADLINE> Reserves Key In Lakers Game 1 Win  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- They don't have a nickname or a much of a
reputation -- except for being inferior to most of the reserves
they're playing against these days.
</P>
<P>
   And the Los Angeles Lakers' substitutes don't much care.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have three All-Stars,'' Rick Fox said, referring to
Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant and Glen Rice. ''We at times are left
wide open, we at times make things happen.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the bench that gets the criticism when we lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering the Western Conference finals, it was the bench that
many thought gave the Portland Trail Blazers an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but not in the second quarter Saturday as the Lakers
blew the game open on their way to a 109-94 victory in Game 1 of
the best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every bench in the league outscored our bench,'' said Robert
Horry, who led the way for the Lakers' reserves with 12 points --
all in the second quarter. ''We don't worry about that, we're just
doing our job. We just go out and play.''
</P>
<P>
   Horry and his mates went out and performed superbly after the
Lakers and Blazers battled to a 26-all tie after one period,
combining for 20 points as Los Angeles outscored Portland 37-16 for
a 63-42 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Portland made it interesting in the fourth quarter, drawing
within nine points with five minutes left. But that was as close as
the Blazers would get as the Lakers overcame their tactics of
continually fouling O'Neal by stopping them at the other end of the
court.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were just clicking today, on the offense end and on the
defensive end,'' Brian Shaw said of the reserves. ''If we're
hitting our shots like that, it's going to be easier for Shaq.''
</P>
<P>
   With Horry scoring his 12 points, Shaw adding five points and
Fox three in the second period, the trio combined to make 7-of-9
shots -- including 5-of-7 from behind the 3-point line -- in
outscoring the Blazers by themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their bench hurt us,'' Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy said.
''They made some big shots, and stretched our defense with their
3-point shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   They reserves also impressed Bryant, who was held to an
uncharacteristically low 13 points.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're deeper than we thought,'' he admitted. ''But the bench
has been doing a nice job for us all playoffs long coming in and
hitting some big shots for us and getting the momentum going.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps so, but it was the Sacramento Kings who had the ''Bench
Mob,'' and the Phoenix Suns who had Rodney Rogers, the NBA's Sixth
Man of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers beat both teams earlier in the playoffs with some
help from their reserves, and now they're up against the club
considered to have more talent on their bench than anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're the better bench,'' Fox admitted. ''Their bench
outplayed our bench. We've heard this talk before. I don't think we
played any different than we have all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Portland's substitutes wound up with 41 points in 79 minutes,
while the Lakers' reserves had 28 points in 66 minutes. But the
events of the second quarter proved decisive.
</P>
<P>
   Horry's first 3-point shot came with the Lakers leading 30-28
and triggered a 14-0 run, with Horry scoring nine of the points and
Fox capping the spurt with his 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage was 24 points before the end of the second period.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just one of those days where you're shooting the rock,
it's falling, the guys are looking for you,'' Horry said of his
performance. ''Everybody's double-teaming Shaq, some times tripling
him. A lot of teams like to sag off our (power forwards).
</P>
<P>
   ''I just took my shots when I had them. I wasn't being
aggressive, I just took the shots they gave me. Once I make two
shots, I'm going to take that third one, test that gun to make sure
it's working.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in this game.
</P>
<P>
   ''Robert played very well,'' O'Neal said. ''I think Robert likes
it when they double me, he stepped up and shot the ball very
well.''

<HEADLINE> Mo. Abortion Law Creates Dispute  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT CHARTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) -- Four terminally ill newborns were kept on
life support at a state-run hospital against their parents' wishes
out of fears that doctors could be charged with murder under
Missouri's new law banning a type of late-term abortion, the
babies' attending physician said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are in legal straitjackets with our hands tied behind our
backs,'' said Dr. John Pardalos, a specialist in neonatal intensive
care at University Hospital and Clinics in Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   All four infants, born since the passage of the 1999 law,
eventually died while on ventilators to assist their breathing,
Pardalos said. Some died in just a few days, but one lived 2{ weeks
after the parents asked to withdraw life-sustaining treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Pardalos said the events turned parents' grief into ''hatred of
the political system.''
</P>
<P>
   The new law, meant to ban what opponents call ''partial-birth''
abortion, makes doctors guilty of ''infanticide'' if they purposely
cause a living infant's death ''by an overt act performed when the
infant is partially born or born.'' The crime is equivalent to
second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the law's definition of a ''living infant'' is a child
''who has not attained the age of 30 days post-birth.''
</P>
<P>
   The abortion foe who wrote the law said the hospital lawyers
were wrong to advise the doctors for the four terminally ill
newborns that the law may apply to them.
</P>
<P>
   ''If that's their legal advice, they're not lawyers,'' said
Louis DeFeo, chief lawyer lobbyist for the Missouri Catholic
Conference. He said the law specifically excuses doctors practicing
''usual and customary standards of medical practice.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a difference between acting with the intent to cause
death and knowing that to withdraw a treatment, death could be a
consequence,'' DeFeo said. ''If you are simply making a medical
judgment, that's not a crime. It's not a crime for a baby or for a
90-year old.''
</P>
<P>
   As in other states where ''partial-birth'' bans have been
overturned, Missouri's law is being challenged in federal court on
the grounds that it also limits otherwise legal kinds of abortions.
The law is on hold for now while the lawsuit is pending.
</P>
<P>
   But the ''waiting period'' in the law of 30 days after birth has
so far not been challenged. So Marvin E. ''Bunkie'' Wright, the
University of Missouri's general counsel, said he is telling school
doctors not to withdraw life support from infants younger than 30
days, despite parents' demands.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the way it is until they receive a court order or court
opinion,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   A check of other Missouri hospitals with large numbers of births
found no restriction similar to those at the university hospital,
which delivered 1,244 babies last year.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert M. Nelson, chairman of the Bioethics Committee of the
55,000-member American Academy of Pediatrics, reviewed the Missouri
law and said he had heard of no similar restrictions anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't imagine the Legislature intended this bill to bar
withdrawing support from an infant who is going to die,'' said
Nelson, a neonatologist at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin. ''If
it was intended, it's going against decisions parents and
physicians make every day around the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The law was passed last year after Missouri's Legislature
overrode the veto of Gov. Mel Carnahan, who supports abortion
rights and has argued that it puts doctors at risk of prosecution.

<HEADLINE> Colbert's Leads Waterhouse Seniors  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG TUCKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Jim Colbert tapped in a 6-inch birdie
putt on the final hole for a 3-under-par 69 Saturday and a
two-stroke lead over Dana Quigley after two rounds of the TD
Waterhouse Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Colbert, who shot a course-record 61 on Friday, was at
14-under-par 130 going into Sunday's final round. Quigley, with a
67 on Saturday, stood at 132.
</P>
<P>
   Bunched at 8 under were Fred Gibson, Dave Lundstrom, Roy
Vucinich, Jim Thorpe and local favorite Tom Watson, whose
6-under-par 66 was the best round of the day on the 6,820-yard
Tiffany Greens course.
</P>
<P>
   Watson and Colbert, both Kansas City natives, were paired with
Quigley for Sunday's final round in a dream threesome for the
gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Colbert, a Kansas City native who hasn't won on the Senior PGA
Tour since undergoing cancer treatment two years ago, was 4 under
for the day and five strokes ahead of Quigley when he
double-bogeyed the par-5 16th.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley, playing with Colbert, made a short birdie putt for a
three-stroke swing. Quigley then birdied the 17th to get within one
stroke, but had to roll in a 15-footer from the fringe to save par
on No. 18 and avoid falling three back.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've always known the putter is the great equalizer,'' said
Quigley, who spent much of the day scrambling for pars. ''It makes
up for a lot of bad swings. I was very, very lucky on No. 18.''
</P>
<P>
   Colbert, who birdied the first eight holes of the back nine
Friday, made three birdies in a row before encountering trouble on
the 16th. His third shot, from about 35 yards in front of the
green, sailed too far and he wound up two-putting for a 7.
</P>
<P>
   ''I probably tried to do too much with that lob shot on 16,''
said Colbert. ''I'd made three birdies in a row, I'm thinking if I
get another one here, it's adios, boys. Greed is terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   On the next hole, Colbert missed a 6-foot birdie putt and
Quigley made a 3-footer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't play much better,'' said Colbert, who missed several
short birdie putts. ''I've never seen anybody who could outplay
their putter. But I putted much better at the end. I felt like I
got in a position where I could make some.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson, after a slight adjustment in his swing, made two eagle
putts and shot his lowest round of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Trailed by a huge gallery, Watson dropped a 3-foot putt eagle
putt on the par-5 1st hole, which he bogeyed on Friday, and rolled
in a 45-footer for an eagle-3 on No. 11. They were his first two
eagles on the Senior tour.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you make an eagle on the first hole, it sets a tone for
the day,'' said Watson. ''It gives you breathing room, and you can
attack the golf course.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was still a little bit nervous. but after making the eagle
on the first hole, the nerves were channeled in the right
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Quigley characterized his scrambling 67 as ''a gift from the
golf gods.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Two shots isn't very much in a golf tournament,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Watson, playing competitively in Kansas City for the first time
since he won the Missouri Amateur Championship in 1971, has said
repeatedly how much he would love to win this event.
</P>
<P>
   ''You guys put so much pressure on him even before the
tournament started,'' said Colbert. ''But he's over that now. He'll
come out gunning. He's our best ball-striker, the best I've seen.''

<HEADLINE> Frank Stronach Gets Preakness Win  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD ROSENBLATT
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Frank Stronach's skip-the-Derby strategy paid
off again.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Touch Gold skipped the Kentucky Derby, nearly
won the Preakness and then spoiled Silver Charm's Triple Crown bid
by winning the Belmont Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Red Bullet, who skipped the Derby, went out and
beat Derby winner Fusaichi Pegasus by 3 3-4 lengths in the $1
million Preakness Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, there will be no Triple Crown winner, and a colt
owned by Stronach is the reason.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before we beat Silver Charm, I said 'Great, whoopee.' It's
great to have Triple Crowns. But on the other hand you can't give
it to someone on a silver platter. I was happy when Touch Gold won,
and at the same time a little sad.
</P>
<P>
   ''In this industry, we need horse heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   Racing has been waiting for a Triple Crown winner since Affirmed
swept the Derby, Preakness and Belmont in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   The 67-year-old Stronach agreed with Orseno to keep the
lightly-raced Red Bullet out of the Derby after a loss to Fusaichi
Pegasus in the Wood Memorial on April 15.
</P>
<P>
   ''Horses are not machines and this one got hooked up in a speed
duel in his last start (the Wood),'' Stronach said. ''So we decided
to skip the Derby and aim for this race. What went through my mind
when he won the race was we made the right decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Stronach, born in Austria, is one of the most powerful people in
racing. He owns Santa Anita, Gulfstream Park, Golden Gate Fields
and Thistledown, among other tracks, and has vast holdings in
racing and breeding. He also operates breeding farms in Ontario,
Kentucky and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   He bought Santa Anita for $126 million in 1998, and Gulfstream
for $95 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   His principal business is Magna International Inc., which
specializes in electronic technology and the manufacture of auto
parts.
</P>
<P>
   In '99, Stronach won his second Eclipse Award as the nation's
top owner and owns such champions as Awesome Again, Wild Rush and
Alwuhush.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it may be on to the Belmont for Stronach &AMP; Co. -- Red
Bullet, trainer Joe Orseno and jockey Jerry Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll see how the horse comes out,'' Stronach said. ''It seems
like he wasn't breathing hard, but Joe will know for sure in the
next few days.''

<HEADLINE> Nine Aspiring NATO Members To Ally  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) -- Nine aspiring NATO members urged the
Western defense alliance to invite them to join by 2002 and agreed
to work together to ensure that happens.
</P>
<P>
   A joint statement adopted Friday at the end of a conference on
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's role in European security
called on the alliance to invite the nine countries to join at the
next summit two years from now.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not only prepared for the responsibilities and burdens
of NATO membership today, but we are already coordinating our
defense structures and policies with the Alliance (by) contributing
to NATO political and military undertakings,'' the statement said,
according to the Baltic News Service.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign affairs ministers of Lithuania, Slovenia, Latvia,
Estonia, Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria and deputy foreign ministers
of Albania and Macedonia signed the statement.
</P>
<P>
   The officials at the meeting also emphasized the importance of
cooperating instead of competing for entry into the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have not come here as competitors in a beauty contest,''
Estonian Foreign Minister Toomas Ilves was quoted as saying by BNS.
He added that the conference at the Vilnius City Hall was itself
proof that the candidates were not ''intending to proceed by way of
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   The countries are hoping to follow Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic, which officially joined NATO during its 1999 summit in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Washington summit participants also approved a so-called
Membership Action Plan to help the remaining aspirants prepare for
the possibility of joining, but it provided no timetable for
accession nor any guarantee that they would get it.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO hopefuls must maintain commitments to strengthen
democracy, human rights, democratic control of the armed forces and
programs to improve military cooperation with the 19 NATO
countries.
</P>
<P>
   NATO Secretary-General George Robertson, who was in the
Lithuanian capital for the meeting, welcomed the joint statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a striking example of how NATO's commitment to keeping
the door open to new members is fostering cooperation,'' Robertson
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The statement also reaffirmed the signatories' determination to
join the 15-member European Union and welcomed the EU's commitment
to building a common European security and defense policy.

<HEADLINE> School boards want state to pay more special education costs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JAMESBURG, N.J. (AP) -- With special education costs rising, New
Jersey School Boards Association on Saturday urged the state to pay
special education expenses that exceed what districts spend on
regular pupils.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous vote came at the association's semiannual meeting
after members of its special education and school finance
committees presented their study showing school budgets are
strained by the cost of out-of-district placements required for
some students.
</P>
<P>
   The study determined the price tag, including costs for travel
and housing, can exceed $200,000 per special education pupil; state
law permits school districts to seek financial relief for annual
costs more than $40,000 per pupil. The average annual cost per
pupil in New Jersey is about $9,000.
</P>
<P>
   The committees also concluded that the process of seeking that
''extraordinary relief'' is too restrictive, with four out of five
such applications being rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ''School districts are having an increasingly difficult time
meeting these requirements with limited funding,'' Edwina M. Lee,
the association's executive director, told the 190 school board
members who attended.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said the association, whose members represent all 21
counties, will continue to support bills in the state Assembly and
Senate that would provide relief for special education costs.
</P>
<P>
   Having the state pick up 100 percent of special education costs
exceeding a district's regular education expenditures would ''go a
long way'' toward addressing property tax relief, said delegate
Nanette Harrington of Long Hill Township in Morris County.
</P>
<P>
   The delegates elected Patti J. Pawling, a member of the
Barrington Board of Education in Camden County, as president for
2000-02.
</P>
<P>
   They also passed resolutions to:
</P>
<P>
   --conduct a study of the financial and educational impact of
student turnover, which each school year averages 15 percent in New
Jersey districts and is twice as high in the Clayton district in
Gloucester County.
</P>
<P>
   --encourage school board members to join teachers and
administrators on local committees that, under state regulations,
develop continuing education plans setting requirements for
currently employed teachers.

<HEADLINE> Serb Opposition To Seek Moscow Aid  </HEADLINE>
By MISHA SAVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Stepping up the most intensive
crackdown in years, Yugoslav police arrested more government
critics Saturday while the opposition sought Russian help in
encouraging President Slobodan Milosevic to ease the repression.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition groups planned rallies Saturday night in Belgrade and
several other cities. But only about 1,000 people turned out in the
capital in heavy rain to demand the government rescind its move to
close down media not controlled by Milosevic's administration.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the crackdown, which began Wednesday, continued
unabated.
</P>
<P>
   The independent Beta news agency reported that at least 24
opposition activists were arrested Saturday in six towns throughout
the country. They included 14 members of the student group Otpor,
or Resistance, who were reportedly detained in the town of Priboj
while putting up anti-government posters. More than 150 people have
been injured in clashes with police since the crackdown started.
</P>
<P>
   The government move followed the May 13 assassination of a
regional official in Novi Sad, which the government blamed on the
opposition. Opposition leaders have denied the charge and claimed
Milosevic's government was simply looking for an excuse to muzzle
the president's critics before local elections expected this year.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Milosevic pledged to defend Yugoslavia against
''enemies'' allegedly trying to break up the country.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and major Western European governments have
condemned the crackdown. But they have little leverage since last
year's NATO bombing campaign, launched to force Milosevic to halt
his repression of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the Kosovo crackdown, Milosevic and several key
figures have been indicted by the international war crimes tribunal
in The Hague. The indictment left Milosevic no option but to resist
any moves to end his rule.
</P>
<P>
   Since the West can do little, opposition leaders are turning to
Russia, hoping that a fellow Slavic nation will have more success
reining in Milosevic. Opposition sources said their two principal
leaders, Vuk Draskovic and Zoran Djindjic, were expected to travel
to Moscow next week to meet with Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and
others.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on the Internet, Djindjic said the opposition
wants assurances that Moscow does not support or in any way justify
Milosevic's crackdown. Draskovic expressed hope that Russia would
''send a strong message to Milosevic to stop the terror against
media and start a dialogue with the opposition'' about free and
fair elections in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright openly
challenged officials of Milosevic's regime to break with him and
join the pro-democracy forces.
</P>
<P>
   ''We agreed that officials in Serbia face a choice,'' she said.
''They can stand for the freedom and the rights of all Serbs, or
they can prolong Milosevic's rule by participating in the
oppression.''

<HEADLINE> West Point Cadets Face Court Martial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST POINT, N.Y.(AP) -- The U.S. Military Academy's first general
courts-martial for theft in recent memory have been ordered for two
cadets charged with felonies in the December break-in at West
Point's cadet store.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. Daniel W. Christman ordered the courts-martial after
reviewing the evidence and charges against cadets William Bender
and John B. Taylor IV, academy spokesman Maj. James Whaley said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bender and Taylor are charged in the theft of $23,000 worth
of clothing, watches and electronic equipment from the store.
</P>
<P>
   Bender admitted his part in a May 8 grand-jury type hearing,
arguing that he was mentally ill and was not able to assist in his
own defense because he suffers from deep anxiety and depression.
</P>
<P>
   A general court-martial is the top military court for crimes.
Both men face a maximum of 20 years in federal prison and dismissal
from the service. They also face having to pay the government for
their West Point educations.
</P>
<P>
   Trial for Taylor is set for June 2. A date has yet to be
scheduled for Bender.

Experts Focus on AIDS Causes, Cures

<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- AIDS is spreading faster among blacks because
prevention programs are underfunded and lingering stigmas about the disease
prevent frank discussions, experts at a three-day summit on the subject
concluded today. Dozens of government and medical officials, clergy and
community activists attended ''An Honest Perspective on HIV/AIDS 2000'' in Short
Hills, a Newark suburb. The experts devised strategies for attacking what they
called an epidemic among blacks, including seeking help from churches and
universities, lobbying for more money for community AIDS groups and increasing
efforts to encourage blacks to get HIV screenings.

straitjackets with our hands tied behind our backs,'' said Dr. John Pardalos, a

<HEADLINE> Deal Reached on Nuclear Arsenals  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The five nuclear powers on the Security
Council agreed Saturday to eliminate their nuclear arsenals, as
part of a new disarmament agenda approved by 187 countries.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement by the signatories to the Nuclear Nonproliferation
Treaty was reached after all-night deliberations and intense
pressure on Iraq and the United States to settle a dispute over
Baghdad's compliance with U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today is a great day for the cause of nuclear nonproliferation
and nuclear disarmament,'' said Algerian U.N. Ambassador Abdallah
Baali, the conference president, as he banged the final gavel to
loud applause.
</P>
<P>
   Although the agreement gives no timetable, and delegates said it
would take many years to achieve a nuclear-free world, it marked
the first time the major nuclear powers had publicly affirmed their
obligation to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   The five-year review conference for the global treaty -- aimed at
controlling and ultimately eliminating nuclear weapons -- required a
consensus, and the U.S.-Iraq dispute threatened to sabotage
approval of a final document.
</P>
<P>
   Signaling the importance Washington placed on the issue of
Iraq's compliance with nuclear agreements, U.S. Assistant Secretary
of State Robert Einhorn, who is in charge of nonproliferation, flew
to New York to take part in the final talks.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after his arrival, Canadian Ambassador Chris Westdal, who
had worked through the night, announced an agreement to applauding
delegates, saying ''the last piece in our puzzle is complete.''
</P>
<P>
   Delegates to the conference said the new agreement was
significant because it marked the first time in 15 years that the
signatories to the nonproliferation treaty have reached consensus
on moving forward with nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan said it ''marks a significant step
forward in humanity's pursuit of a more peaceful world -- a world
free of nuclear dangers, a world with strengthened global norms for
nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the five nuclear powers -- the United States,
Russia, Britain, France and China -- agreed to ''an unequivocal
undertaking'' to eliminate their nuclear arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   The NPT, which came into force in 1970, has only four holdouts:
India and Pakistan, which conducted rival nuclear tests in 1998,
Israel, which is believed to have nuclear weapons, and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates repeatedly stressed the importance of getting those
nations to sign -- a step many concede is crucial to the cause of
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   The final document reaffirmed ''the importance of Israel's
accession to the NPT'' and urged India and Pakistan, despite their
nuclear tests, to become parties to the treaty ''as non-nuclear
weapon states.''
</P>
<P>
   But China's U.N. Ambassador in Geneva, Hu Xiaodi, was critical,
saying the document did not ''fully reflect the current
international situation, nor does it call for the removal of
fundamental obstacles to nuclear disarmament.''
</P>
<P>
   Hu cited a host of issues that weren't addressed in the final
document -- the expansion of NATO, the absence of any reference to
no first use of nuclear weapons or U.S. plans for a limited missile
defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the delegates did take other important steps
leading up to a total ban on nuclear weapons, including a
moratorium on testing pending activation of the Comprehensive
Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, further reductions of tactical nuclear
weapons, increased transparency on reporting information about
nuclear arsenals and taking weapons off ''hair-trigger'' alert.
</P>
<P>
   They also agreed to permanently and irreversibly remove
plutonium and uranium from nuclear warheads, and to negotiate
within the next five years a treaty banning the production of
weapons-grade nuclear material.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.-Iraq dispute centered on Iraq's compliance with U.N.
sanctions requiring that Iraq's facilities for producing nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons be shut down. The United States
maintains that Iraq has not adequately accounted for its weapons
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's U.N. Ambassador Saeed Hasan initially said Baghdad would
accept the International Atomic Energy Agency's January inspection
of its nuclear reactors under the NPT treaty -- but was vehemently
opposed to U.S. demands for a statement that the IAEA inspection
would not substitute for its Security Council obligations.
</P>
<P>
   Under the compromise language, the conference noted an April 24
statement by the IAEA director-general that since Iraq has
suspended weapons inspections since December 1998 ''the agency has
not been in a position to provide any assurance of Iraq's
compliance'' with the U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   At the final plenary session of the conference, Hasan entered a
reservation on the compromise, reiterating that there was ''no
reason'' to include Iraq or the Security Council resolution in the
document.
</P>
<P>
   But without naming Iraq, U.S. Ambassador Robert Gray said it was
important that the conference expressed ''profound concern about
cases of noncompliance.''

<HEADLINE> Freedman Wins Olympic Cycling Trial  </HEADLINE>
By TIM KORTE
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Nicole Freedman has a Stanford education
that isn't directly linked to her current job. She has an appetite
for ''greaseburgers.'' She lives in an old van, parked next to a
friend's home.
</P>
<P>
   And Freedman has a ticket to the Sydney Olympics, by virtue of
her victory Saturday in the U.S. Olympic cycling trials road race.
</P>
<P>
   Freedman won by about 1{ bike-lengths over Pam Schuster of
Northridge, Calif., and third-place Mina Pizzini of Philadelphia.
Each was timed in 2 hours, 38 minutes, 56 seconds on the relatively
flat 64-mile course.
</P>
<P>
   The men's winner was Antonio Cruz, 28, of Long Beach, Calif.,
who won in 5:21.31, also by sprinting for the finish line after 138
miles. His wheel crossed just ahead of Derek Bouchard-Hall of Palo
Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the Saturn trade team, Cruz was assigned to help
place teammate Frank McCormack in a position to win. When McCormack
broke away with a kilometer to go, other riders stayed with him.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz kept pace at the rear of the lead pack. When the riders
jockeyed within sight of the finish line, Cruz -- last year's
national criterium champion -- got the best route and raced harder
in the final 15 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew someone was going to jump early, someone who wasn't
known to be a sprinter,'' Cruz said. ''That's all I wanted to key
off with 400 or 500 meters to the line. ... It made it the perfect
race for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Cruz raised his arms and let out a whoop as he sped across the
finish line, with Bouchard-Hall and third-place racer Frankie
Andreu of Dearborn, Mich., narrowly behind him.
</P>
<P>
   After he stopped, Cruz folded his hands and said a prayer of
thanks as his eyes welled with tears.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was just so happy,'' he said. ''I tend to get pretty
emotional, especially with a big win. All the support that I've
had, it's running through my mind right now. It keeps me going.''
</P>
<P>
   Freedman, who turns 28 on Sunday, focused her training
exclusively on the road race, the only event where U.S. Cycling
officials promised an Olympic trip for the winner.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was my only goal of the year,'' Freedman said. ''I kept
telling myself I could win this.''
</P>
<P>
   Other positions on the American track, road and mountain bike
cycling teams will be determined this summer by coaches and
administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Freedman went to high school in Wellesley, Mass., spent two
years at MIT and transferred to Stanford. She was on the Cardinal
track team but got into cycling after struggling as a junior to
remain competitive as a runner.
</P>
<P>
   Riding was a comfortable fit, and Freedman earned a degree in
urban planning, although she now works for a women's sports
marketing firm. She lives in a van that remains parked at a
friend's home.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's had the same tank of gas since 1996,'' she said. ''If I
jump-start it, I can get it going.''
</P>
<P>
   Realizing her chances of making the Olympic squad as a coaches'
pick were unlikely, Freedman focused on road race. Her favorite
training spot is a stretch of road near the Stanford campus called
Coyote Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a great way to build power for the sprints and work on
speed going down,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Freedman was part of a six-member group that broke from the main
pack with about 25 miles remaining. Her strength is sprinting, and
she pulled away over the final kilometer then powered up a 200-yard
incline to the finish.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hats off to Nicole,'' Schuster said. ''She totally earned
it.''
</P>
<P>
   When she crossed the line, Freedman raised her right arm and
pumped her fist. A short distance up the road, she collapsed on the
pavement in a fit of joy, then hugged anybody within 20 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a dream come true,'' she said. ''I didn't believe it
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate, Freedman plans to visit a Stanford-area hangout,
Eat at Eric's, that tempted her but was off limits during training.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to have a double greaseburger, fries and a root
beer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz grew up in Whittier, Calif., and became interested in
cycling after his father, Carlos, took him to see the road race
during the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics.

   A standout on the junior circuit, the younger Cruz ''lost that
spark for racing'' during the early 1990s. He found it again five
years later while living in Reno, Nev., and attending an area road
race.
</P>
<P>
   ''I watched guys who I had raced against,'' Cruz recalled. ''I
was just a spectator but I felt like I was in the race. I was
watching moves unfold, knowing I could be there. I knew I still had
it.''
</P>
<P>
   He resumed training the next week and now he'll ride in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   After Cruz won on Saturday, a jaded competitor told him, ''Have
fun riding for Lance,'' suggesting Cruz will be asked to help
reigning Tour de France champ Lance Armstrong of Austin, Texas,
secure the Olympic gold.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure I'll have a role, but my role here today wasn't to
win,'' Cruz said. ''Anything could happen. You never know.''

<HEADLINE> Documents: Spy Suspect Let Off Easy  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN SOLOMON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government struck a plea bargain that
resulted in no prison time for a nuclear scientist who confessed to
passing secrets to China, rather than await an analysis that
ultimately concluded he ''directly enhanced'' Beijing's weapons
program, documents disclose.
</P>
<P>
   The documents, gathered by Senate investigators, detail weeks of
miscommunication between prosecutors, defense officials and the FBI
that led up to the December 1997 plea bargain for former U.S.
nuclear labs scientist Peter H. Lee.
</P>
<P>
   The miscommunication left the Justice Department official with
final authority for the case unaware that his prosecutor would seek
minimal prison time for Lee. As it turned out, the judge gave Lee
no prison time even though he was informed Lee had been deceptive
in his cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Had this been our opening position in plea negotiations, I
doubt that I would have approved it, particularly the short period
of incarceration,'' Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Keeney
told a Senate Judiciary subcommittee recently.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's case has fallen in the shadows of the Wen Ho Lee spy case
at the Los Alamos lab that dominated headlines for months.
</P>
<P>
   But testimony, government documents, and a draft Senate report
reviewed by The Associated Press detail missteps by the government
that mirror those that already criticized in Wen Ho Lee's case.
</P>
<P>
   The problems included the unexpected appearance of a Navy memo
that raised questions about the quality of Peter Lee's case and
would have been available to defense lawyers at trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''As our prior testimony reflected, the conclusions drawn by
this draft report are contrary to fact,'' said Justice Department
spokesman Myron Marlin. ''The government secured two felony
conictions in a difficult case. It was a case where questions were
raised by the Defense Department and government scientists about
the classification of information disclosed and concerns were
raised about national security disclosures that might result from
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials say they wanted to avoid a trial to
protect sensitive counterintelligence information that would have
divulged some of the methods and sources used to detect Lee's
activities for China.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, officials sought to press Lee into a plea bargain,
secure his cooperation, put him in prison for a short time and hope
he would help on other China espionage matters, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The plan backfired, however, when Lee was found to be deceptive
during his cooperation. Prosecutors also were surprised by the
judge's leniency.
</P>
<P>
   There were other complications.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors decided not to wait for an analysis of how much Lee
damaged national security and proceeded with the plea bargain just
weeks after obtaining his confession.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Liebman, a prosecutor, told senators he thought it was
''impractical'' to wait for a damage assessment because he believed
it would take a year to complete.
</P>
<P>
   But within two months, the Energy Department had completed an
impact analysis of Lee's disclosures.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's classified information ''was of significant material
assistance to the PRC in their nuclear weapons development
program,'' the department concluded in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''This analysis indicates that Dr. Lee's activities have
directly enhanced the PRC nuclear weapons program to the detriment
of U.S. national security,'' the memo stated.
</P>
<P>
   PRC is the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who led the Senate's review, sharply
criticized the rush to the plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was just atrocious,'' Specter said. ''I think it was
indifference to the severity of the issue and a traditional
interest in chalking up a conviction, which is meaningless when
there is no substantial jail time as warranted by the infraction.''
</P>
<P>
   Specter's draft report concludes prosecutors should have brought
more severe espionage charges against Lee, or at least tried to
break the plea bargain when he did not fully cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   Justice officials counter that to do so would have forced them
to disclose the sensitive counterintelligence they wanted
protected.
</P>
<P>
   Lee worked at the Energy Department's Lawrence Livermore and Los
Alamos nuclear labs and was a federal contractor for more than two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1997, he admitted to the FBI he shared classified
information with Chinese nuclear scientists both in 1985 and 1997 --
some of it involving a secret $100 million joint U.S.-British
project on radar detection of nuclear submarines.
</P>
<P>
   Since the plea bargain, which required Lee's cooperation, the
scientist failed an FBI lie detector test and left U.S. officials
convinced he has not disclosed the full extent of his activities
for China, a draft Senate report states.
</P>
<P>
   There were other miscommunications, the report shows.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors did not give defense officials a copy of Lee's
videotaped confession, instead providing them a more limited
affidavit. As a result, Navy officials were confused about whether
the information Lee shared with China was in 1997 was classified.
Defense officials knew about the tape, but did not ask for it.
</P>
<P>
   The latter miscommunication resulted in what Justice officials
called a ''body blow'' to their case. A month after Lee's
confession, the Navy produced a memo suggesting it was not worth
prosecuting Lee for disclosing information about the submarine
project.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is difficult to make the case that significant damage has
occurred,'' the Nov. 14, 1997, Navy memo stated, citing questions
about whether the information passed to China was unclassified,
confidential or secret.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors were stung by the memo, and worried Lee's lawyers
would use it to create doubt with jurors. Earlier this year,
defense officials finally watched Lee's confession video and
concluded the information he passed the Chinese was indeed
classified.
</P>
<P>
   There also was confusion about whether Lee could have been
charged with espionage instead of the lesser charges of attempting
to communicate national defense information and making false
statements.
</P>
<P>
   Liebman said he did not think he could prove an espionage charge
even though the information Lee admitted giving to China in 1985
was classified as secret. By the time the case emerged, some of the
information had been declassified, he noted. Another prosecutor
said he was told to accept the lesser charge ''or nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   But memos show FBI and Defense officials expected Lee to be
charged with the ''heftier charge'' if the deal fell through.
</P>
<P>
   Senate investigators also cite a failure to renew an electronic
surveillance warrant in fall 1997 that would have allowed the FBI
to gather more information about Lee's contacts.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials question whether their information was
too stale, whether it was worth renewing the warrant because Lee
had recently discovered an FBI bug and whether they were legally
allowed to obtain a warrant when the case became overtly criminal.
</P>
<P>
   But Specter disclosed the FBI intercepted an incriminating
e-mail in August 1997 -- after Lee had found the bug -- and said that
provided ample reason for renewal.
</P>
<P>
   ''The loss of electronic surveillance on Dr. Lee occurred at a
critical juncture that may have seriously hampered the government's
ability to collect counterintelliegnce information,'' his draft
states.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As the House heads for a showdown this week on granting
China permanent trade benefits, both sides agree the legislation will help shape

supporters argue it would open Chinese markets to U.S. companies and improve
conditions by exporting American values. Over the weekend, the dwindling number

<HEADLINE> Cardinals 19, Pirates 4  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The St. Louis Cardinals hit three more homers,
giving them an NL-leading 88, to beat Pittsburgh 19-4 Saturday
night in their highest-scoring game since 1977.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals scored seven runs in the eighth and five more in
the ninth off Pirates utilityman Keith Osik, who yielded a two-run
homer to Thomas Howard an inning after hitting a two-run homer
himself.
</P>
<P>
   The 19 runs were the most by the Cardinals since they scored 21
against the Cubs in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals starter Pat Hentgen (4-4) had lost four in a row and
was winless in five starts since April 16 before allowing three
runs -- two on Osik's homer in the eighth with the Cardinals leading
by 13 -- in seven-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, Hentgen ended the losing streak on the road, where he
is 61-33 in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire, who had walked three times, hit a three-run double
in the seven-run eighth inning, a drive off the center field wall
that missed by about three feet of being a grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Matheny hit a three-run homer later in the inning while
going was 3-for-5 with a career-high four RBIs. The Cardinals had
19 hits and surpassed their previous high of 14 runs.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Cordova (1-4) came off the disabled list to lose his
fourth in a row and his second successive start to the Cardinals,
who followed a 13-1 loss Friday with a 15-run victory.
</P>
<P>
   Cordova didn't get much help from a shaky defense that committed
four errors, all of which came in innings the Cardinals scored. The
Cardinals' defense, by contrast, turned four double-play grounders
behind Hentgen and has an NL-low 20 errors.
</P>
<P>
   Cordova, again struggling with his control, walked Craig
Paquette to start the second. After Matheny singled and Hentgen
struck out, Fernando Vina hit a drive into the right-field seats on
a 2-1 pitch for his third homer.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals needed only one hit -- Matheny's RBI single -- while
scoring twice in the third with the help of two walks and two
errors. Cordova has 13 walks in his last four starts.
</P>
<P>
   Osik, who entered in the eighth during a double switch, hit two
batters and threw a run-scoring wild pitch. He also pitched an
inning last season in a 19-8 loss to Houston.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Jason Kendall, who on Friday became the first NL catcher to
hit for the cycle since Randy Hundley of the Cubs in 1966, was
1-for-4. ... Cardinals catchers Matheny and Eli Marrero have yet to
commit an error. ... Cordova hasn't won since pitching 7 1-3 no-hit
innings against Houston on April 6. ... Jim Edmonds was 2-for-4,
raising his NL-best road average to .459. ... Wil Cordero returned
to Pittsburgh after missing four games to attend child custody
proceedings in Puerto Rico, going 1-for-3 to extend his hitting
streak to 13 games. ... The Pirates have at least one extra-base
hit in all 41 games. ... The crowd of 36,331 was the Pirates'
largest since opening day. ... Hentgen has never had a five-game
losing streak since breaking into the majors with Toronto in 1991.

<HEADLINE> 'Friends' Actor in Car Accident  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Actor Matthew Perry wrecked his Porsche
Saturday when he swerved to avoid a car on the narrow streets of
the Hollywood Hills and drove into someone's porch, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old star of the hit TV show ''Friends'' was
uninjured, said Sgt. Paul Partridge. Perry was not under the
influence or drugs or alcohol at the time of the noon accident,
Partridge said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Perry was driving downhill, and he swerved to avoid
another vehicle, probably coming the other direction. He wasn't
able to regain control and ran off the road,'' Partridge said.
</P>
<P>
   Perry's green Porsche was damaged and had to be towed, Partridge
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said no police report was made because nobody was hurt and
there was no evidence of wrongdoing. Officers helped Perry and the
residents exchange phone numbers and insurance information.
</P>
<P>
   Perry is one of six co-stars of the wildly popular ''Friends,''
a staple of NBC's Thursday night lineup. In a deal reached earlier
this month, Perry and the other actors will be paid $750,000 per
episode for two years.

<HEADLINE> Rockies 4, Phillies 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Kevin Jarvis and four Colorado relievers
combined on a two-hitter and Neifi Perez singled home the go-ahead
run in the eighth inning Saturday night to give the Rockies a 4-3
victory over the Philadelphia Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies lost for the seventh time in eight games. Third
baseman Scott Rolen did not play because of soreness in his legs
and back, and will also sit out Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis held the Phillies hitless until Doug Glanville hit a
two-run homer with one out in the sixth, tying it at 2. One out
later, Bobby Abreu also homered.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis, who began the game with a 7.85 ERA in three starts, left
after Abreu's homer.
</P>
<P>
   Julian Tavarez, Mike DeJean, Mike Myers and Jose Jimenez teamed
for hitless relief in the final 3 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Tavarez (3-2) pitched a scoreless seventh for the win, while
Jimenez got two outs for his sixth save.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies scored twice in the eighth. Todd Helton opened with
a single off Chris Brock (0-4) and Jeffery Hammonds' double-play
ball was misplayed by shortstop Desi Relaford.
</P>
<P>
   After a wild pitch advanced the runners, Darren Bragg walked.
Brent Mayne's grounder scored pinch-runner Brian Hunter with the
tying run and Perez singled with two outs.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado took a 2-0 lead in the second on an RBI double by
Helton and a bases-loaded walk to Tom Goodwin by Paul Byrd.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd allowed two runs and three hits in six innings, striking
out four and walking three.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Mike Lansing singled in the seventh inning to extend his
hitting streak to 10 games. ... So far this season, Colorado has
had four weather postponements, two rain-delayed games, a Coors
Field power outage. On Friday night, the game was delayed for 12
minutes because the umpires were late arriving. ... Rolen leads the
Phillies in home runs (12) and RBIs (27).

<HEADLINE> McCain Urges Vt. GOP on Bush  </HEADLINE>
By LISA RATHKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- Sen. John McCain thanked Vermont
Republicans on Saturday for their support in the presidential
primary earlier this year and urged them to come together now for
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''I ask all the McCain supporters -- Republican, independent,
independent-minded Democrats -- to join us in electing Governor Bush
as president of the United States. ... Now is the time for unity,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   A bid by McCain supporters to control the Vermont delegation at
the party's national convention this summer was dashed when
Republicans nominated a majority of Bush-supporting delegates.
</P>
<P>
   McCain later crossed into New Hampshire to support the
re-election of Rep. Charles Bass, one of Bush's earliest
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's a natural logical question to say, 'Why are you
campaigning for Charlie Bass when he endorsed Governor Bush?'
McCain told reporters. ''I think the answer is obvious: If I only
campaigned for people who endorsed me in my campaign, my activities
would be severely restricted.''
</P>
<P>
   He also repeated that he and Bush agree more ''a lot more things
than we disagree on'' and said he expected to be back in New
Hampshire in four years -- campaigning for Bush's re-election as
president.
</P>
<P>
   Confusion over Vermont's method of electing delegates lingered
at the state's convention.
</P>
<P>
   Because McCain won Vermont's presidential primary in March with
60 percent of the vote, he was supposedly was entitled to all of
the Vermont's 12 delegates and 12 alternatives. But the convention
rules did not require that individuals loyal to McCain in the
primary actually be selected delegates and an attempt to change the
system Saturday was defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates to the state convention were allowed to vote for any
of the nominees for delegates to the national convention. Bush
backers won nine of the 12 slots, while McCain supporters won
three.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the party in the next four years has to make a change
in the way we go about electing delegates,'' said state Sen. Peter
Brownell of Chittenden, head of the McCain campaign in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Party Chairman Patrick Garahan, who is a Bush
supporter, agreed. ''I think the whole election law needs to be
looked at, particularly in this case. If I were a McCain supporter,
I'd be disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the makeup of the Vermont delegation, McCain asked
Vermont GOP members to draw on shared Republican principles to back
Bush, the governor of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the strength of our party,'' said the Arizona senator.
''Healthy debate, shared principles, shared ideals, shared goals.
The party of Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan,
and adherence to those principles.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was confident Bush would restore ''integrity and
purpose to the highest office'' and he pledged to do all that he
could to ensure Vice President Al Gore, the putative Democratic
nominee, is defeated.

<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Rondell White tied a team record with three
doubles and Peter Bergeron homered as the Montreal Expos held off
the Houston Astros 8-7 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Hideki Irabu (2-3) allowed six hits and three runs in six
innings for his first victory in his last seven starts. Irabu also
drove in a run for the first time in his career with a single in
the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal built an 8-2 lead through five innings before Houston
pulled close by scoring four runs off three Expos relievers.
</P>
<P>
   Dustin Hermanson allowed Houston's last two runs, but earned his
third save by getting the final three outs.
</P>
<P>
   Bergeron hit his third homer off Scott Elarton (2-1) in the
first, doubled in the second, walked in the fourth, and hit a
run-scoring single in the fifth. Needing a triple to complete the
cycle, Bergeron grounded to short in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   White doubled in each of his first three at-bats to tie a team
record shared by 26 players, and drove in two runs. He grounded out
and popped out in his last two plate appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's Craig Biggio left the game after his right hand was
spiked by second baseman Jose Vidro while stealing his eighth base
of the season in the first.
</P>
<P>
   Moises Alou's RBI single gave the Astros a 1-0 lead in the
first, but Bergeron's leadoff homer in the bottom half tied the
game. One out later, White doubled and, after Vladimir Guerrero
grounded to short, Lee Stevens hit a two-out RBI double to put
Montreal ahead 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos scored four unearned runs off Elarton in the second.
Orlando Cabrera reached as Russ Johnson, who pinch-ran for Biggio
in the first and stayed in the game at second base, bobbled his
grounder for an error.
</P>
<P>
   Cabrera stole second and, one out later, scored to make it 3-1
on Irabu's single to right. Bergeron's double advanced Irabu to
third and Jose Vidro followed with a sacrifice fly to right. White
hit the first of two straight RBI doubles and Guerrero hit a
run-scoring single to increase Montreal's lead to 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   Houston drew to 6-2 when Ken Caminiti led off the fourth with a
towering shot to right for his ninth homer.
</P>
<P>
   White's RBI double in the fourth chased Elarton, who allowed
seven runs -- though just three earned -- in three-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos increased their lead to 8-2 on Bergeron's RBI single
off reliever Mike Maddux in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's Mitch Meluskey had an RBI single in the sixth, Johnson
hit a run-scoring single off reliever Felipe Lira in the seventh,
and Bill Spiers hit his first home run of the year to lead off the
ninth, bringing on Hermanson.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Biggio had a cut on the back of his right hand stitched and
watched the rest of the game from the Astros' dugout. ... Astros
manager Larry Dierker is two wins away from his 300th career win.
Dierker has a 298-228 mark since becoming Houston's manager
following the 1996 season. ... The win gave the Expos their eighth
series in their last 10. ... White is the second Expo with three
doubles in a game this season. Vidro did it against Arizona on
Wednesday. ... LHP Jim Poole and RHP Guillermo Mota both joined the
Expos on Saturday. Poole, 33, was signed by Montreal as a free
agent Friday after being released by Detroit two days earlier. Mota
was recalled from Triple-A Ottawa when RHP Anthony Telford was
placed on the 15-day DL Friday with tendinitis in his right
shoulder. INF Trace Coquillette was optioned to Ottawa, and C Bob
Henley was moved from the 15-day to 60-day disabled list to make
room for Poole on the 40-man roster.

<HEADLINE> Brewers 7, Giants 0  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Jose Hernandez's grand slam capped a six-run
first inning Saturday night as the Milwaukee Brewers beat San
Francisco 7-0, the Giants' eighth straight loss.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff D'Amico (2-1) made a remarkable return to County Stadium,
allowing four hits over seven shutout innings in his first start in
Milwaukee since Sept. 27, 1997. After missing all but one inning of
the last two seasons with shoulder problems, he has allowed one
earned run in three starts this year for an 0.43 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee won its third straight.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants need to win the series finale Sunday to avoid an 0-9
road trip. San Francisco, swept by Colorado and Atlanta earlier,
has fallen from second place to fourth in the NL West during the
slide.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the Brewers' first seven hitters of the game reached base
against Mark Gardner (2-2). The rally began with third baseman Bill
Mueller's two-base throwing error on Ron Belliard's grounder, which
was followed by consecutive run-scoring doubles down the
right-field line by Mark Loretta and Jeromy Burnitz.
</P>
<P>
   After Charlie Hayes singled and Marquis Grissom walked,
Hernandez hit a shot that barely cleared the right-field fence for
his fourth homer of the year. Hernandez's only other grand slam in
the majors came on Aug. 31, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   After a dismal April in which he hit .173, Hernandez is finally
starting to warm up to his first job as an everyday player. He had
a two-run triple on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Belliard added a 410-foot solo homer to deepest center in the
second inning for the Brewers, who appear to have shaken their
early-season offensive woes. They scored 11 runs against San
Francisco on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amico was in complete control. He struck out three and gave up
just one walk while throwing 72 of his 113 pitches for strikes.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed just two runners to reach second base and retired
nine of his last 10 batters. After being called up from Triple-A
Indianapolis on May 9, he allowed just one earned run in 14 innings
of two road starts.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner retired his last 10 hitters before being lifted for a
pinch-hitter in the eighth. The Giants staff has allowed 60 earned
runs during the current losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Bonds was in San Francisco's lineup for the second
straight game after missing four with a back injury. He grounded
out three times and struck out.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Milwaukee will play six home games in the next five days
while making up for rainouts. ... Hernandez's grand slam was
Milwaukee's second of the season. Henry Blanco had the first on May
12. ... In the third inning, Burnitz made a nifty running catch of
Doug Mirabelli's foul ball just one step from the stands. ...
Milwaukee's previous two games -- a 16-inning outing on Tuesday
against Houston and Friday night's 10-inning game with the Giants --
lasted exactly 10 combined hours.

<HEADLINE> Bayern Munich Wins Bundesliga Title  </HEADLINE>
By NESHA STARCEVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) -- Bayern Munich completed an improbable
double and won the Bundesliga title Saturday when it beat Werder
Bremen 3-1 and Bayer Leverkusen lost 2-0 at Unterhaching.
</P>
<P>
   Leverkusen went into the final round with a three-point lead and
needed only a draw in Unterhaching to clinch its first title. But
it allowed an early own goal and gave up another goal in the second
half, then wasted several great opportunities and ended up
empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   Not far away, in Munich's sold-out Olympic Stadium, Bayern
romped over Bremen on two early goals by striker Carsten Jancker to
celebrate its 16th Bundesliga title, a record.
</P>
<P>
   Bayern also won the German Cup two weeks ago, but was knocked
out of the Champions League semifinals by Real Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   ''We played a great season and attractive soccer,'' Leverkusen
coach Christoph Daum said. ''Today, we didn't use our best
opportunities. We are deeply sad, it's a huge disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   Both teams finished with 73 points, but Bayern retained the
title on better goal differential.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel sorry for Daum. All my compliments to Unterhaching,''
said Bayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld. ''Leverkusen would have deserved
it, too. It was one of the toughest title fights Bayern has had.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Gary Sheffield hit a grand slam to dead center
field against his former team, capping off the Los Angeles Dodgers'
12-6 win over the Florida Marlins on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros homered and drove in three runs as the Dodgers won
their fourth in a row. Shawn Green had a triple, double and single
for Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield's seventh career slam in the seventh inning made it
12-3. His 442-foot shot was his 13th home run and came against
rookie Joe Strong.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers improved to 5-0 against the Marlins this season. Los
Angeles finished with 15 hits and Florida had 14, with every player
in both starting lineups -- excluding pitchers -- getting at least
one hit.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Perez (4-2), who entered the game with a 7.40 ERA in five
road starts and was coming off an outing in which he allowed seven
runs in 1 2-3 innings, pitched six innings. He gave up three runs
and nine hits.
</P>
<P>
   Green's RBI triple sparked a two-run first inning and Adrian
Beltre's triple in the third inning drove in two more runs to stake
the Dodgers to a 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Penny (3-6) gave up four runs in three innings and left
because of lower back spasms. After a 3-1 start, he is 0-5 with a
7.46 ERA in his last five starts.
</P>
<P>
   Karros hit his 12th homer and Alex Cora added an RBI single in
the fifth. Karros later walked with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Floyd and Danny Bautista hit solo homers for the Marlins.
Alex Gonzalez had a three-run double in the seventh off Dodgers
reliever Antonio Osuna.
Notes: Green's triple in the first inning was his first since
Sept. 20, 1998. ... Todd Hundley's single in the first gave him 17
RBIs over his last 11 games. ... Marlins reliever Ron Mahay singled
in his first at-bat in the big leagues since he was a replacement
outfielder for the Boston Red Sox in 1995. He was 4-for-20 that
season with his last hit (a home run) coming on May 26, 1995. ...
Marlins bullpen coach Tony Taylor was ejected in the sixth inning
for arguing.

<HEADLINE> Saturday's Baseball Game Notes  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressAMERICAN LEAGUE:
Yankees-Indians:
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK: When Shane Spencer's hamstring tightened up in
Saturday's 3-2 loss to the Indians, Lance Johnson found himself
playing left field for the first time since Sept. 10, 1990. In the
seventh inning, Johnson was unable to come up with a diving catch
on Enrique Wilson's as Cleveland rallied to tie it. ''It had been
awhile,'' said Johnson, who recently had been working out in left.
... Jeff Nelson had his seven-game winning streak stopped when he
walked four in the ninth, including Roberto Alomar to push home the
winning run. And for all his success, Nelson has 17 walks in 24 2-3
innings this season. ... If losing Saturday meant breaking Chuck
Finley's hex over the Yankees, then that was fine with manager Joe
Torre. ''We had some good at-bats against him,'' Torre said of
Finley, 16-9 in his career vs. New York. ''That's a far cry from
early on when he would dispense of us 1-2-3.''
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: Chuck Finley doesn't particularly care for his
''Yankee Killer'' nickname, and he knows there are plenty of other
dangerous teams in the AL. ''I'm not all hyped up over the
Yankees,'' he said. ''Last year, it was the Boston Red Sox that
beat Cleveland. I think we have to beat 'em all.'' ... OF David
Justice missed his second straight game with a tender hamstring.
... The comeback over New York put some excitement back in the
Indians clubhouse which got rowdier when players and coaches
gathered to watch the Preakness Stakes. ... Saturday's win via a
walk-off walk, was the second time in Jacobs Field history the
Indians had won at home on a bases-loaded walk. On June 1, 1994,
the Indians beat the Angels 3-2 in 10 innings when Mike Butcher
walked pinch-hitter Rene Gonzalez.
White Sox-Blue Jays:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: James Baldwin is 14-1 with a 2.50 ERA while pitching
indoors. ... Baldwin is 4-0 at SkyDome. ... Nine of Baldwin's 15
earned runs have come via the home run. ... The White Sox have won
six straight at SkyDome. ... Frank Thomas went 3-for-3 with two
walks.
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: RHP Roy Halladay, who started the season in Toronto's
rotation, gave up six runs on seven hits in five innings for
Triple-A Syracuse on Saturday. The Buffalo Bisons scored three runs
in the first, and three more in the fifth. ... David Wells had his
consecutive win streak stopped at six. ... Nine of Carlos Delgado's
12 home runs have been solo shots.
Tigers-Red Sox:
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: Manager Phil Garner knows his team's weakness is
hitting with runners in scoring position. The Tigers entered
Saturday's game against Boston hitting just .199 with runners in
scoring position. ''We need to get (hits) when guys are on base,''
he said. ''We're the worst team in the league with guys in scoring
position. There's nothing more I can say about it. I've been over
it a thousand times. Maybe not a thousand. I've been over it about
25 times.'' They were 2-for-5 Saturday, including Bobby Higginson's
RBI double in the fourth inning. ... Juan Gonzalez is 9-for-20 in
his last five games with six RBIs. ... Dave Mlicki has won his last
two against New York and Boston, giving up just two runs and seven
hits in 14 innings.
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: Tim Wakefield suffered a bruised left calf when he was
hit by Jose Macias' seventh-inning liner, and is listed as
day-to-day. ... The Red Sox's staff, which shut out Toronto on
Wednesday and the Tigers on Friday, was looking for three straight
shutouts for the first time since collecting three in a series at
Toronto in August of 1990. ... Pete Schourek, Saturday's starter,
has given up one earned run in his last two starts, covering 13
innings.
Orioles-Rangers:
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: On Saturday morning, Red Oak High School in the
Dallas suburbs dedicated its baseball field as Buddy Groom Field.
The Orioles reliever is a 1983 graduate of the high school, where
he was an all-district outfielder as a senior. ... Orioles starter
Mike Mussina began Saturday night with the third-highest winning
percentage in road games in major league history among starters
with at least 100 road decisions who began their career 1900 or
later. Mussina's .660 winning percentage (68-35) ranks behind
Whitey Ford's .695 (116-51) and Christy Mathewson's .665 (183-92).
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: Rangers LHP Kenny Rogers' availability for next week is
still in doubt. Rogers has been bothered by a sore left shoulder
and Sunday night will mark the second start he's missed. Rogers is
scheduled to throw on the side Sunday. If he comes through that
session without pain, Rogers could be ready to pitch Wednesday
night in Oakland. Manager Johnny Oates said a start on Saturday
against Seattle might be more realistic. ... Rogers has a swollen
eye from an accidental punch while playing with his 3-year-old son.
... Friday night's home rainout was the first for the Rangers since
Sept. 5, 1999.
Twins-Athletics:
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: Brad Radke pitched the 19th complete game of his
career on Friday night, and first this season. It was also
Minnesota's second complete game. ''You want to try and pitch nine
innings every time you go out,'' Radke said. ''It doesn't matter
who you face, you don't want to give up any runs.'' Radke's last
complete game was on Sept. 5 last year at Tampa Bay. ... Denny
Hocking started Saturday's game at 3B, his 10th appearance at the
position this season. He's played everywhere but catcher and
pitcher this year, also playing nine games each at second base and
right field. It doesn't seem to matter where he plays against the
Oakland A's. He tied his career high with five hits against them on
Thursday and is 9-for-13 with three walks, a home run and four RBIs
in the first three games of the four-game series which concludes
Sunday. He's reached base safely in 15 of his last 20 plate
appearances against Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: DH John Jaha is ready to start a rehab assignment, but
the question is where? The A's are leaning toward sending him to
their extended spring training facility in Arizona when the team
leaves for a nine-game road trip on Monday. Jaha would prefer to
face live pitching in a real game. ''I would love to go with
(Triple-A affiliate) Sacramento,'' Jaha said. ''But I'll go where
they want me to go. It's hard to tell right now how far along I am
because I'm swinging off a tee.'' Jaha has been on the disabled
list since April 24 with a strained left shoulder and sore elbow.
''We don't want to take any unnecessary chances,'' A's manager Art
Howe said. ''We want John healthy.''... 3B Eric Chavez didn't start
Saturday because the Twins had a left-hander on the mound. Chavez
is batting .147 against left-handers. He's also 2-for-24 (.083) on
the current homestand.
Devil Rays-Mariners:
</P>
<P>
   DEVIL RAYS: Esteban Yan had a career-high eight strikeouts in
his 12th career start for Tampa Bay. His previous high was seven.
... The Devil Rays are 9-9 in one-run games this season. ... Miguel
Cairo was 3-for-4 Saturday, making him .365 (27-for-74) in his
career against the Mariners. ... Roberto Hernandez recorded his
237th career save, most by a pitcher born outside the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: In addition to his 76th career leadoff home run, Rickey
Henderson walked twice, giving him 1,999 for his career. He's third
on the career list and needs 20 to tie Ted Williams (2,019) for
second place. ... Four Mariners pitchers walked eight batters. ...
Edgar Martinez is hitting .448 (30-for-67) in May with seven home
runs and 17 RBIs.
Royals-Angels:
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: RHP Jerry Spradlin has more saves on the Royals'
current road trip (three) than he's had in any season; his previous
career high was two, in 1993 with Cincinnati. ... Kansas City's
bullpen had blown nine of 14 save opportunities before Spradlin
found his groove. ... The Royals' May 9 rainout in Detroit was
officially re-scheduled as part of a July 22 day-night
doubleheader.
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: Pitcher Kent Mercker, hospitalized since suffering
cerebral bleeding May 11, is expected to be discharged from UCI
Medical Center on Monday. ... Injuries have left the Angels thin in
pitching, but Ramon Ortiz, who started the season in their
rotation, is not a candidate to be brought back from Edmonton. In
two starts there, Ortiz has given up six runs, lasting a total of
only 2 1-3 innings. ... Shortstop Gary DiSarcina, disabled since
May 8 with a tight shoulder, continues to consider surgery, which
would end his season.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Reds-Cubs:
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: Reds starter Ron Villone threw 127 pitches Saturday
in winning his fourth straight start. ''I had no idea,'' he said.
''My arm felt great and I felt like I could have thrown another
100.'' Villone had all three of his walks in the first two innings
before settling down. ''The ball was all over the place. I battled
myself,'' he added. ... Reliever Danny Graves is the first Reds
pitcher to start a season 6-0 since Johnny Ruffin in 1994. No Cincy
pitcher has gone 7-0 since Ron Robinson or 8-0 since Mike LaCoss in
1979. Graves is also 7-for-7 in save opportunities. ... The Reds
are 10-1 when Ken Griffey Jr. homers and eight of his 13 homers
have tied or put them ahead. ... Reds bullpen coach Tom Hume is
donating $50 to the Shriners Hospital in Cincinnati for every win
and save by a Reds reliever. So far, he's donated $1,150 for nine
wins and 14 saves.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: LHP Scott Downs, who's made eight starts, is headed to
the bullpen until next Saturday when he'll get another start
against San Francisco. ... Manager Don Baylor said he will try to
play OF Henry Rodriguez in Sunday's series finale against the Reds.
Rodriguez has been sidelined with a bruised knee after fouling a
ball off it Tuesday. Yankees scout Gene Michael was at the game
again Saturday and is believed to be scouting Rodriguez for a
possible trade. ''He's on special assignment. Mr. Steinbrenner sent
him here to look at a player. I don't know if it will result in
anything,'' Baylor said of Michael. ''George believes in him
(Michael). If they want to make a deal, they will.'' However,
Rodriguez is not interested in leaving: ''I don't want to be
traded. I want to stay here,'' he said. According to published
reports, the potential deal would send Ricky Ledee and a reliever
to the Cubs for Rodriguez. ... Baylor said the Cubs might place 3B
Shane Andrews on the disabled list because of a bad back.
Astros-Expos:
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: The Astros entered the game with a 199-157 mark against
the Expos, including a 96-83 record in Montreal. ... Astros manager
Larry Dierker is two wins away from his 300th career win. Dierker
has a 298-227 mark since becoming Houston's manager following the
1996 season.
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: The Expos were looking to claim their eighth series in
their last 10 Saturday night, following a 3-2 win Friday in 10
innings. It was Montreal's first extra-inning game of the season
and first win in extra innings at Olympic Stadium since Aug. 4,
1998. The Expos were 0-7 in extra innings at home last season. ...
LHP Jim Poole and RHP Guillermo Mota both joined the team Saturday.
Poole, 33, was signed by Montreal as a free agent Friday after
being released by Detroit two days earlier. Mota was recalled from
Triple-A Ottawa when RHP Anthony Telford was placed on the 15-day
disabled list Friday due to tendinitis in his right shoulder. INF
Trace Coquillette was optioned to Ottawa, and C Bob Henley was
moved from the 15-day to 60-day disabled list to make room for
Poole on the 40-man roster.
Rockies-Phillies:
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: Phillies 3B Scott Rolen sat out the game and will
not play Sunday because of soreness in his legs and back. ''I'm not
complaining, but the fact is the turf has caught up with me,''
Rolen said. Rolen, who leads the Phillies in home runs (12) and
RBIs (27) has played on turf in 19 of his last 22 games.
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: So far this season, Colorado has had four weather
postponements, two rain-delayed games, a Coors Field power outage,
and Friday night, the game was delayed for 12 minutes because the
umpires arrived late. ... On Friday night, Pedro Astacio threw 119
pitches, 66 for strikes. In the club's previous game on Wednesday
against New York, Rolando Arrojo threw the exact same amount of
pitches and strike.
Dodgers-Marlins:
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: The Dodgers are 6-1 on Fridays. ... Eric Karros'
11-game hitting streak was snapped Friday. He hit .381 with five
homers and 13 RBIs during the streak. ... Dodgers broadcaster Vin
Scully was in New York on Friday to deliver the commencement speech
at Fordham University where he was bestowed an honorary degree of
Doctor of Humane Letters. Scully will rejoin the Dodgers in time
for Sunday's game. Ross Porter and Rick Monday called the game
Friday. ... SS Alex Cora, who started Friday, was playing in South
Florida for the first time since the Dodgers drafted him out of the
University of Miami in the third round of the 1996 draft. ... The
Dodgers failed to hit a home run Friday for the 10th time in 39
games this season. They've hit 64, and are on pace to hit 266 home
runs. The major league record is 266, set by the 1997 Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: IF Kevin Millar was scratched from the starting lineup
after taking a line drive off his left foot Friday night. Millar,
filling in for injured 3B Mike Lowell, was replaced by utilityman
Dave Berg. ... 2B Luis Castillo's eight-game hitting streak was
snapped Friday, as was his streak of 14 consecutive steals, two shy
of tying his own team record of 16 straight.
Cardinals-Pirates:
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: After batting cleanup in his first 30 starts, Mark
McGwire batted third for the second night in a row Saturday.
Manager Tony La Russa wanted some left-handed batters around
McGwire to keep the Pirates' right-handed starters -- Kris Benson on
Friday and Francisco Cordova on Saturday -- from pitching around
him. ... Former Pirates manager Jim Leyland, now a Cardinals scout,
shagged throws for La Russa during batting practice. Leyland, lives
in Pittsburgh, was La Russa's third-base coach with the White Sox
before becoming the Pirates manager in 1986. ... 2B Fernando Vina,
who left Friday night's 13-1 loss to Pittsburgh after being struck
in the calf by a Kris Benson pitch, returned to the lineup
Saturday. ... The Cardinals have been outscored 23-8 in rookie
left-hander Rick Ankiel's two starts against the Pirates. Ankiel
allowed seven runs and seven hits in 2 2-3 innings Friday,
prompting pitching coach Dave Duncan to say, ''You can't say you're
surprised, because at this stage of his career he's still
developing. There are still some things he doesn't do consistently
yet. You hope he'll do that as time goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: Wil Cordero returned to the Pirates lineup after
missing four games to return to Puerto Rico for a child custody
hearing. Cordero was granted temporary custody of his two children,
ages 2 and 3, by the wife he is now divorcing. ... The Pirates have
used six leadoff batters, including 2B Warren Morris, who led off
Saturday for the second time this season. C Jason Kendall began the
season as the leadoff hitter, was dropped to third during a
team-wide batting slump and now is batting second. ... After this
weekend, the Pirates don't face an NL Central team again until they
play the Cubs on June 27. ... Todd Ritchie, a 15-game winner last
season who starts Sunday against the Cardinals, has lasted only
eight innings in his last two starts. ... RHP Rich Loiselle, who
had 29 saves as a rookie in 1997, continues on a rehabilitation
program at Double-A Altoona but is not close to returning to the
majors. He had reconstructive right elbow surgery in July, and has
not regained the velocity he had three seasons ago.
Diamondbacks-Mets:
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: Tony Womack singled in the sixth inning to tie his
career high with a 16-game hitting streak. In an official scoring
change, Womack was credited with a single in the seventh inning of
Friday night's game instead of reaching base on an error by 1B Todd
Zeile. ... Closer Matt Mantei will likely be activated from the DL
Sunday. The Diamondbacks haven't missed him much as the bullpen has
a 1.55 ERA the last 15 games entering Saturday's action. Overall,
Arizona's relievers are second in the league with 2.95 ERA. ... OF
Steve Finley was scratched after being hit on the right elbow by a
pitch Friday night. Travis Lee got his first career start in center
field. ... 3B Matt Williams went 1-for-4 Friday night for Double-A
El Paso as he rehabs his broken right foot. Williams is 5-for-11 at
El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: The game was delayed 3 hours, 31 minutes by rain.
Because of the delay, fans from the game could get free tickets to
an additional game on June 20 or 21 against Philadelphia, or June
26 or 27 against Florida. ... Mike Hampton threw 13 straight
strikes to open the game. ... 3B Robin Ventura was sidelined with a
sore left thigh and could be out a few days. Joe McEwing started in
his place. ... Melvin Mora, on the DL with a cut right index
finger, will have stitches taken out Sunday. ... Jay Payton snapped
an 0-for-23 slump with a single in the fourth.
Padres-Braves:
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: OF Tony Gwynn, plagued by injuries all season, was
out of the lineup again after hurting his left knee running the
bases Friday night. Gwynn twisted his knee in the third inning
while trying to get back to first after a single. He remained in
the game for a couple of more innings, leaving for a pinch-runner
after going 3-for-3 to raise his average from .196 to .241. But the
knee was still bothering Gwynn 24 hours later, so Eric Owens
started in right. ''It's sore right now,'' manager Bruce Bochy
said, adding that he hopes Gwynn can return to the lineup Monday
when the Padres return home for a series against the New York Mets.
Gwynn played in only 16 of San Diego's first 41 games.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: 2B Quilvio Veras was hobbling in the clubhouse, his
right knee heavily taped after being struck by a pitch in the first
inning Friday night. A severe bruise caused him to be replaced in
the lineup by Keith Lockhart. ''It's going to take a couple of days
to get back,'' Veras said. ... P Tom Glavine, who was sick Friday
night and didn't come to the ballpark, took part in batting
practice before heading home. He is expected to take his regular
turn in the rotation Sunday. ... Ned Yost IV, the son of third-base
coach Ned Yost, played this weekend in the finals of Georgia's
Class AAAA playoffs with Lassiter High School. Lassiter was
defeated in the deciding game Saturday by Lowndes High, 13-5.
Giants-Brewers:
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: The Giants' 11-10 loss in 10 innings Friday night
was their seventh straight, their longest streak of the season and
two more than their longest last season. The seven losses were all
on the road. ... The Giants entered Saturday night's game against
Milwaukee second-to-last in the NL with 36 errors for a .976
fielding average on 1,472 total chances. ... Mark Gardner made his
300th career appearance and 243rd start Saturday night in the game
against Milwaukee. He returned to the starting rotation to replace
Joe Nathan, who is on the disabled list with tendinitis in his
right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: The Brewers had won their last two games heading into
Saturday night's contest against the Giants, but it wasn't easy.
The games encompassed 26 innings, one 16-innings, with an elapsed
time of 10 hours. ... The Brewers said they will call up pitcher
Jamey Wright from a rehabilitation assignment in Triple-A to start
next Tuesday against the Braves. He has been on the disabled list
since March 28 with a sub-surface rotator cuff tear in his right
shoulder. ... Outfielder Geoff Jenkins, out since May 6 with a
broken right middle finger, has had the splint taken off his
injured finger. But it may take a week to 10 days before he can
return to the lineup.

<HEADLINE> Braves 10, Padres 6  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Keith Lockhart, filling in for the injured
Quilvio Veras, homered for the first time in nearly a year and the
Atlanta Braves beat the San Diego Padres 10-6 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Rafael Furcal drove in three runs for the Braves, who
have won seven of their last eight and have scored 56 runs during
that span.
</P>
<P>
   Veras, Atlanta's regular leadoff hitter, couldn't play after
getting plunked on the right knee by a pitch Friday night. But
Lockhart, hitting just .194, stepped in at second and went 3-for-4,
including a three-run homer in the second inning. His last homer
was May 25, 1999, at Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   The switch-hitting Furcal moved into the leadoff spot and
continued to flourish, driving in a run with a left-handed single
in the fourth and adding a two-run single the next inning after
switching around to bat right-handed. Furcal, 19, is 14-of-26
during a six-game hitting streak that has raised his season average
to .340.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones also had a two-run single in the fourth, when the
Braves broke a 3-3 tie by scoring five runs. The Padres had a
chance to lessen the damage, but shortstop Damian Jackson bounced a
throw to first with two outs and runners scored from second and
third after the ball deflected away from first baseman Ryan Klesko.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson made two errors in the game and the Padres made four
overall, leading to four unearned runs.
</P>
<P>
   John Burkett (3-2) picked up the win despite allowing six runs
and 11 hits in 6 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, after giving up an RBI single to Klesko and
forcing in a run with a walk to Bret Boone, Burkett escaped a
bases-loaded, no-out jam by striking out Jackson and getting Ruben
Rivera on a double-play grounder.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres put runners at first and third with one out in the
fifth, but Boone hit into another double play. Burkett was finally
knocked out in the seventh when Carlos Hernandez hit his first
homer, a two-run shot.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres started Will Cunnane (1-1), recalled from Triple-A
Las Vegas earlier in the day. He had a 1-0 lead in the first on
Phil Nevin's run-scoring double but couldn't hold it, surrendering
six hits and five earned runs in 3 1-3 innings. Two more runs were
unearned.
</P>
<P>
   Nevin went 3-for-3 to improve to 12-of-18 through the first five
games of the Padres' six-game road trip. He has three homers, 13
RBIs and six runs scored during his hot streak.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Gwynn missed another game for the Padres because of a sore
left knee. He has played only 16 of 42 games and will likely sit
out Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Braves drew their second sellout and largest crowd of
the year at Turner Field, 49,653. ... Gwynn has 3,080 hits, one shy
of Cap Anson for 17th place on the career list. ... An 11-7 loss
Friday ended a streak of 41 straight games in which the Braves won
by scoring at least six runs, going back to an 8-7 setback at
Toronto last July 20. ... Veras will probably miss Sunday's game
along with Gwynn.

<HEADLINE> NRA's Heston Lashes Out at Gore  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NOWELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Charlton Heston told more than 5,000
National Rifle Association members Saturday that he wants to serve
an unprecedented third term as their president to complete a
mission: ensuring Al Gore's defeat in November.
</P>
<P>
   ''George Washington hung around until the Revolutionary War was
won,'' he said. ''Roosevelt hung around until the world war was
won. Reagan hung around until the Cold War was won. If you want,
I'll hang around until we win this one, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Heston said the nation's gun owners are at grave risk of losing
their Second Amendment right to bear arms if Gore wins the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   He and other speakers accused the Clinton administration of
plotting to confiscate guns from law-abiding citizens, then ban
them, beginning with licensing and registration.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Gore is elected, the Second Amendment will face 16
cumulative years of Clinton-Gore attacks,'' said Kayne Robinson,
the NRA's first vice president. ''It cannot survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Heston said the NRA has done everything he has asked during his
two terms as president, including increasing its fund raising and
membership. ''That leaves me with one mission undone -- winning in
November,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His offer was greeted with a rousing ovation. He is expected to
be re-elected Monday.
</P>
<P>
   As Heston concluded his speech, he was handed a vintage musket,
then gave an encore of his performance at his first NRA convention
in 1990 in St. Louis, when he intoned the Second Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ''So as we set out this year to defeat the divisive forces that
would take our freedom away, I want to say those words again for
everyone within the sound of my voice to hear and to heed, and
especially for you, Mr. Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Lifting the musket over his head, Heston grumbled: ''From my
cold dead hands!''
</P>
<P>
   Before Heston's speech, gun advocates marched through the
streets of downtown Charlotte to show solidarity.
</P>
<P>
   About 400 marchers, many in T-shirts reading ''Guns Save
Lives,'' followed a bagpiper about six blocks to the center where
the NRA convention is being held.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Wieglib of Troutman, N.C., was pulling a wagon carrying
her two young sons and bearing a sign that read ''We're an NRA
family.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm doing it for them,'' Wieglib said, nodding to her sons
Reid, 5, and Jess, 4. ''I'm saving their inheritance.''
</P>
<P>
   Heston and other speakers never mentioned presumptive Republican
presidential nominee George W. Bush, but they repeatedly brought up
Gore and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., used parts of his keynote address to
talk about the motives of the Columbine school shooters and
violence in society. He blamed much of that violence on cultural
decay led by Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must call them what they are. They are cultural
polluters,'' Watts said. ''They are playing a central role in the
corrosion of our children's character and they should no longer get
a free ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign said Saturday that the presumptive Democratic
nominee would continue to push for stricter gun control. Gore has
criticized Bush signing a bill allowing Texans to carry concealed
handguns.
</P>
<P>
   ''George W. Bush and the NRA are working hip holster to hip
holster to promote an extremist agenda,'' said Gore campaign
spokesman Chris Lehane. ''Al Gore will continue to fight for common
sense gun reform to protect our families and he'll fight against
the NRA and George W. Bush's extremist positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Bush announced that Texas will spend about $1 million
a year for five years to buy trigger locks that citizens can obtain
for free at police departments and fire stations. As president,
Bush said, he would ask Congress to expand the program nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Gore support a mandatory trigger lock
requirement, along with background checks for firearm purchases at
gun shows and a ban on imports of high-capacity ammunition clips.
</P>
<P>
   NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre accused Gore and
Clinton of lying about guns ''to scare America's moms and run
against the Second Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He paints a fictional nightmare of a nonexistent world where a
reckless population of stupid gun owners cause 13 innocent kids a
day to die from guns,'' LaPierre said. ''Well, it's all a big,
stinking, dangerous Al Gore lie.''

Nuclear Powers Agree To Disarm

   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The five nuclear powers on the Security Council agreed
today to eliminate their nuclear arsenals as part of a new disarmament agenda
agreed to by 187 countries. The agreement by the signatories to the Nuclear
Nonproliferation Treaty was reached after all-night deliberations and intense
pressure on Iraq and the United States to settle a dispute over Baghdad's
nuclear compliance. Although the agreement gives no timetable, and delegates
said it would take many years to achieve a nuclear-free world, it marked the
first time the major nuclear powers had publicly affirmed their obligation to
disarm.

MDs Said Reluctant To Break Bad News
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Terminally ill cancer patients rarely get a straight
answer when they ask doctors how long they have to live, a new survey suggests.
Researchers found that doctors are likely to be overly optimistic about their
patients' outlooks or simply refuse to say. Only about one-third are willing to
give patients their best guess. The new research, presented today at the opening
of the annual scientific meeting of the American Society for Clinical Oncology,
suggests that not only are doctors bad at making predictions, but they are also
uncomfortable passing the information to the people they treat, at least when
the message is discouraging.

investigators, detail weeks of miscommunication between prosecutors, defense
officials and the FBI that led up to the December 1997 plea bargain for former
U.S. nuclear labs scientist Peter H. Lee. The miscommunication left the Justice
Department official with final authority for the case unaware that his

<HEADLINE> Timberwolves Guard Sealy Killed  </HEADLINE>
By JASON WOLF
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Minnesota Timberwolves swingman Malik Sealy
was killed Saturday when his sport utility vehicle was hit head-on
by a pickup truck traveling the wrong way on a divided highway.
</P>
<P>
   Sealy, 30, died of head and chest injuries after the 4 a.m. CDT
crash on Highway 100 just north of a construction zone in suburban
St. Louis Park.
</P>
<P>
   He was on his way home after celebrating the 24th birthday of
teammate Kevin Garnett, who had admired Sealy as a youth.
</P>
<P>
   Timberwolves players and players' wives were at Sealy's home
comforting his wife, Lisa, and young son, Malik Remington, said
coach Flip Saunders and Kevin McHale, vice president of basketball
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a sudden and devastating loss to our team,'' McHale
said. ''We're in shock. Malik was one of the most popular players
in our locker room, and one of the biggest reasons behind our
turnaround and success this past season on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   A moment of silence was observed at the opener of the Western
Conference finals between the Portland Trail Blazers and the Lakers
in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ''Malik Sealy was a stellar contributor to the NBA, his team and
his community,'' NBA commissioner David Stern said. ''This is a
tragic day for the NBA family and we extend our sympathy and
prayers to his family.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, team president Rob Moor called Sealy a
''unique individual.''
</P>
<P>
   ''His sense of humor is what I'll remember more than anything.
His off-the-cuff comments; he could take you by surprise and say
the most wonderful things at the perfect time. That's something
we'll certainly miss,'' Moor said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Saunders: ''Words can't express the loss that I feel
today. Malik was a wonderful person who touched everybody in a
special way.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnie Walsh, president of the Indiana Pacers, the team that
chose Sealy in the first round of the 1992 NBA draft, remembered
him as ''a tremendous performer and a true gentleman.''
</P>
<P>
   The pickup driver, Souksangouane Phengsene, 43, was traveling
north in the southbound lane, the patrol said. He was hospitalized
in satisfactory condition with head and chest injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Neither accident victim was wearing a seatbelt, police said. An
airbag deployed in the truck. Sealy's sport utility vehicle didn't
have an airbag.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities had not talked to Phengsene by Saturday night, so
the investigation was still in its early stages, said Capt. Al
Smith of the state patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Sealy, Garnett and at least one other player had a late dinner
at the Monte Carlo Bar &AMP; Cafe in downtown Minneapolis late Friday
night, said manager Tony Rimarcik. He said a group of about six or
seven people had gathered in a separate room, and left the
restaurant just before 1 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Sealy is the second NBA player killed in a traffic accident this
year. Charlotte Hornets guard Bobby Phills died after a crash on
Jan. 12, when he and teammate David Wesley were racing their
Porsches at more than 100 mph after a morning practice.
</P>
<P>
   Sealy was involved in a car accident on his way to practice
during his first season with the Timberwolves and needed 20
stitches to close a cut on his forehead.
</P>
<P>
   Sealy had just finished his eighth NBA season and his second
with the Timberwolves. He averaged 11.3 points in the regular
season and 12.5 in the playoffs as Minnesota was eliminated in four
games in the first round by Portland. He played in every regular
season and playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   His season was notable for the way he improved his shooting
percentage, making more than 50 percent of his shots over the first
half of the season -- a rarity for an NBA guard -- before finishing
at 47.6 percent. He had never shot better than 43.5 percent in his
first seven seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Sealy, who also played in the NBA for Indiana, the Los Angeles
Clippers and Detroit, grew up in New York and starred at St.
John's, where he was the school's second-leading career scorer
behind Chris Mullin when he left following his senior season in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will long remember Malik, not only for his outstanding
ability on the basketball court, but also for his gentleness and
strength of character in our classrooms and throughout our
campus,'' said the Rev. Donald J. Harrington, president of St.
John's.
</P>
<P>
   As a high school senior, Sealy led Tolentine to a No. 1 national
ranking and the New York state championship.
</P>
<P>
   Garnett once said Sealy had been one of his favorite players
while Sealy was playing at St. John's and Garnett was an
eighth-grader in Mauldin, S.C. He even wore Sealy's No. 21 that
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't the most confident guy at that time, and I was trying
to find someone who was another me. Not the best player, but
someone who played like me,'' Garnett said in January 1999. ''With
Malik, I just related to his body.''
</P>
<P>
   Sealy also was an actor and sold a line of ties and clothing
through Malik Sealy XXI Inc. While playing with the Clippers, he
appeared on such TV shows as ''The Sentinel'' and ''Diagnosis:
Murder,'' and in the film ''Eddie.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife and son, he is survived by his parents, Sidney
and Ann Sealy.
</P>
<P>
   His father was a bodyguard for slain civil rights leader Malcolm
X. Sidney Sealy named Malik after one of Malcolm X's Muslim names.

<HEADLINE> 2 Fiji Groups Pledge Coup Support  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Two influential ethnic Fijian groups pledged
their support Sunday for rebels holding the South Pacific nation's
ethnic Indian prime minister and members of his Cabinet hostage in
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Ratu Tevita Bolobolo, leader of the Taukei movement of ethnic
Fijians, read out a statement that was also endorsed by the main
opposition party, known as SVT.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not and we will never accept the reinstatement of the
Chaudhry government,'' Bolobolo said, referring to Prime Minister
Mahendra Chaudhry. ''We hereby state that we fully support the
abolition of the 1997 constitution and warn (Fijian President) Ratu
Mara that any intervention by force will lead to all out civil war.
</P>
<P>
   ''We the Taukei are ready to make the ultimate sacrifice so as
to return this country to the Taukei.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement was the first major sign of support for rebel
leader and self-appointed new Prime Minister George Speight who
launched an armed coup Friday, saying he represented all ethnic
Fijians.
</P>
<P>
   The statement was sent to Ratu Mara along with a demand for
changes to the constitution so only an indigenous Fijian can hold
the offices of prime minister and president and to revert all
freehold land to native ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Combined, the Taukei movement and SVP party command strong
support among ethnic Fijians who make up 51 percent of the national
population of 813,000.
</P>
<P>
   For months, ethnic tensions have been building between
indigenous Fijians and the descendants of Indian migrants, who
dominate commerce in Fiji, which lies 2,250 miles northeast of
Sydney, Australia. Indians make up about 44 percent of Fiji's
population of 813,000 while indigenous Fijians account for 51
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Sunday, the rebels released 10 hostages after they
signed documents backing the coup leader, local radio reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had to sign the conditions, it was a condition of our
release,'' said John Ali, one of the government members released.
</P>
<P>
   Ali said all lawmakers were led one by one into a room by two
hooded gunmen and told to sign letters of resignation. They were
told if they didn't they would be shot by rebels in the event of
armed intervention to end the standoff.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were given a life or death ultimatum. We chose life,'' Ali
said of the lawmakers who signed.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji's Radio 96 reported that the 10 were released in two
groups. About 50 people were captured in Friday's uprising.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhry, who was not one of those released, earlier collapsed
inside the Parliament House complex. Local media reported that
Chaudhry's collapse was stress-related.
</P>
<P>
   Speight allowed doctors in to see Chaudhry after daybreak and he
was reportedly given oxygen and was resting under sedation.
</P>
<P>
   Local radio also reported that a shot was fired inside the
parliament complex early Sunday, prompting Speight to order all
lights in the complex turned off. Speight later said the shot was
accidentally fired by one of his own men, radio reported.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the members of Chaudhry's coalition government who were
released Sunday were indiginous Fijians, local radio reported.
</P>
<P>
   The coup attempt appeared headed for failure Saturday as
military, police and influential Fijian leaders lined up behind
Chaudhry's democratically elected government and the president.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an action myself and my group are willing to risk our
lives for,'' said Speight, barefoot and dressed in a traditional
sulu skirt, talking through the gate to international media for the
first time Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Speight said he had appointed a new president using executive
powers assumed in the coup.
</P>
<P>
   Former Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka -- himself the leader of
two coups in 1987 -- is acting as chief negotiator between the
rebels and Mara and he returned to parliament Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Rabuka, who accused Speight of treason, has urged the group to
surrender. He left parliament after about an hour without
commenting on negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji's capital, Suva, was quiet Sunday, as it has been since
rioters rampaged downtown on Friday following the raid on
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   But unrest was reported in other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Police said there was localized looting in the western town of
Raki overnight, and issued a public warning that lawbreakers would
be treated harshly.
</P>
<P>
   A state of emergency and dawn to dusk curfew have been imposed
for two weeks.

<HEADLINE> Devils Lose Three Straight Games  </HEADLINE>
By IRA PODELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The New Jersey Devils were less
than 21 minutes from a two-game advantage in the Eastern Conference
finals. They never got there, and now are just 60 minutes away from
elimination.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils, one of the NHL's best defensive teams, saw a
two-goal lead evaporate in Game 2. They followed it with two
straight home losses to Philadelphia. New Jersey, which lost to the
Flyers 3-1 Saturday night, needs to win the final three games of
this best-of-seven series to reach the Stanley Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in a situation where there is no other way to play than
desperate,'' said Bobby Holik, the Devils' lone scorer in Game 4.
''Maybe that will bring the best out of us.''
</P>
<P>
   It all turned bad for the Devils late in the second period of
the second game in Philadelphia. New Jersey was protecting a 3-1
lead when Eric Desjardins got free for a goal with just over 38
seconds left in the period.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers gained life and confidence, scoring twice within the
first two minutes of the third period to win. They haven't looked
back.
</P>
<P>
   ''Things change quick,'' Devils captain Scott Stevens said.
''That's what we're trying to do, change it back.''
</P>
<P>
   The shellshocked Devils find themselves in an unfamiliar,
desperate situation.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey, which reached the conference finals for the first
time since winning the Stanley Cup in 1995, squandered a 15-point
lead over Philadelphia to lose the division and home-ice advantage
in this series.
</P>
<P>
   ''We put ourselves in this position by not playing smart,''
Holik said. ''We could be right up there with them if we played the
way we want to. We're running out of time.''
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey played it's game through the first two periods
Saturday, but only had a 1-1 tie to show. The Devils broke down in
the third and allowed a goal to fourth-line forward Craig Berube
with 7:02 left and another to rookie Simon Gagne just 3:42 later.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got to listen to what the coaches say,'' left wing Jay
Pandolfo said. ''We did it for two periods, but then we got away
from it. They should have broken sticks over our heads until we got
the message.''
</P>
<P>
   The lost opportunities are gnawing at the Devils, especially
because they feel they are the superior team.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no doubt in my mind,'' right wing Randy McKay said.
''Now we're going to have to have everything go for us. We have to
have our heads on straight and have a little bit of luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Holik scored with 7:47 left in the second period to tie it at 1
and goalie Martin Brodeur was having a much better game than in New
Jersey's 4-2 loss in Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   ''All three goals, there was nothing he could do about,'' Holik
said. ''What could he do? He does it all for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils, who had only one losing streak of at least three
games in the regular season, just couldn't play well enough for
long enough to get the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''We started running around in the third period and turned the
puck over,'' Holik said. ''For whatever reason, we changed our plan
and played into their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey still has hope that its best will somehow show up
again.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can still turn it around,'' defenseman Colin White said.
''We haven't proved it in the last couple of games, but we still
believe it deep down.''

<HEADLINE> Mass Counterterrorism Test Begins  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The largest-ever field test of the nation's
ability to respond to a terrorist attack with chemical or
biological weapons began Saturday, involving Cabinet secretaries,
governors and municipal leaders in two cities.
</P>
<P>
   The counterterrorism exercise called ''TOPOFF'' involved a
simulated chemical attack on Portsmouth, N.H., followed by a
simulated biological weapon attack in Denver. The $3.5 million
program, mandated by Congress was paid for by the Department of
Justice and the federal Office of Emergency Management.
</P>
<P>
   The Portsmouth scenario involved an explosion at a mock charity
event that led to a number of ''fatalities'' and ''injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a test of people's abilities to respond to what has
happened,'' said Mike Beeman, FEMA spokesman in Portsmouth.
</P>
<P>
   The New Hampshire exercise involved a simulated explosion at the
New Hampshire Port Authority that left dozens of people at a mock
charity run with imaginary injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Though local officials knew their communities had been selected
for the terrorism test, they did not know it would begin Saturday.
They were told only that it would take place sometime in May.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Van Dongen, spokesman for the state Office of Emergency
Management, said that around 8 a.m. Saturday, emergency crews were
called to respond to a van explosion at the Port Authority.
</P>
<P>
   ''When the police and fire equipment arrived they figured out
pretty quickly they had more than just explosion victims because
that explosion expelled some sort of chemical agent,'' Van Dongen
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem for the first responders was to figure out what
they had, how to contain it, how to treat the victims and how to
protect themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Portsmouth officials quickly called for assistance from
communities as far as 50 miles away and that Gov. Jeanne Shaheen
declared a state of emergency and asked President Clinton to issue
a disaster declaration.
</P>
<P>
   Such a declaration, in the event of a actual emergency, would
qualify the state for federal assistance.
</P>
<P>
   In Aurora, Colo., authorities responded to a simulated
biological attack on a mock hotel just outside Denver,
</P>
<P>
   ''This is their opportunity to do something that they hope
they'll never have to do in real life,'' said Division Chief Doug
Abraham of the Aurora Police Department, one of about 200 people
who participated in the exercise.
</P>
<P>
   In the drill, a vacant building on the former Fitzsimons Army
Medical Center campus was turned into the make-believe Hide-Away
Hotel, where a mock maid discovered a 25-year-old man dead in his
room just after 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Under the simulation, police become suspicious because the
corpse -- played by a mannequin -- had skin lesions, blood around the
mouth and gangrene in one big toe, said FBI special agent Mark
Mershon.
</P>
<P>
   While members of actual media organizations were kept behind
police tape at the far end of the street, fake television reporters
wearing black satin ''Virtual News Network'' jackets were allowed
much closer.
</P>
<P>
   The national test was expected to last 10 days. Attorney General
Janet Reno, Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, and
FEMA Director James Lee Witt, and state and local leaders were
expected to take part.
</P>
<P>
   A separate, but related counterterrorism test was also scheduled
to start Saturday in Washington and adjacent Prince Georges County,
Md., by the FBI, FEMA, and the Energy Department.
</P>
<P>
   They will respond to a fake attack with an as-yet undisclosed
type of weapon of mass destruction.
