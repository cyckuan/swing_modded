<HEADLINE> Mandela Hails Tightening Of S. African-Norwegian Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 12 (Xinhua) -- President Nelson Mandela
today told visiting Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Grundtland that
the South Africa-Norway ties has been strengthened with the signing
of four agreements of bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a banquet in Cape Town in honor of Grundtland,
Mandela said the economic cooperation is the focus of the ties.
</P>
<P>
"We appreciate in particular the fact that our exports to your
country have been facilitated by Norway's extension to us of the
generalised system of preferences," said the president.
</P>
<P>
"For us your visit is an opportunity both to celebrate and to
reaffirm the partnership between our countries, and to ensure
that the bonds forged in struggle flourish in freedom," Mandela
told Grundtland.
</P>
<P>
He also praised Norway for its role in the South Africa's
black liberation struggle and its aid of one billion Rand ($274
million) to the anti-apartheid movement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Brundtland said sanctions and boycotts belonged to
the past and Norway enjoys South Africa's partnership.
</P>
<P>
Brundtland, who arrived in South Africa last Saturday, made a
tour to Robben Island on Sunday with Mandela to commemorate the
president's release from prison six years ago.

<HEADLINE> NY Gov. Signs Law to Ease Disclosure on Child Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 13 (Xinhua) -- New York Governor George E.
Pataki signed legislation Monday loosening laws requiring secrecy
in child abuse investigations, local press reports said.
</P>
<P>
The new law, approved by the senate and the assembly last week,
changed two secrecy provisions governing child welfare
investigation.
</P>
<P>
The law would require the authorities to disclose information
about investigations the child welfare workers conduct. It also
calls for eliminating a statute that requires the destruction of
records when an allegation of abuse is investigated but not
substantiated.
</P>
<P>
The legislation, also called "Elisa's Law", was established in
response to the death of Elisa Izquierdo. The 6-year-old girl was
beaten to death by her mother in New York last November. The case
prompted a public outcry because Elisa's relatives, neighbors and
teachers had repeatedly warned child welfare officials that the
girl might be in danger.
</P>
<P>
After Elisa's heath, officials, citing confidentiality laws,
refused to disclose the details of the case, that heightened the
public uproar.
</P>
<P>
The governor said that he hoped the new law would help save
other children.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, there were 3.1 million reports of child abuse and
neglect and 1,300 child abuse victims died in the United States,
according to a recent New York Time report.
</P>
<P>
The USA Today, in a report on another child abuse case, said
that during the predicted six-week trial of a child killer,
115,000 children would disappear in the country and another 14,000
will experience failed kidnaping attempts. More than half of those
kidnaped will wind up dead.
</P>
<P>
The report, citing government figures, said that 350,000 kids
would suffer physical or sexual abuse in the same six weeks.

<HEADLINE> Black American Leader Vows to Change System in USA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 13 (Xinhua) -- A visiting black American
leader today vowed to bring a critical change to the United States
while his Iranian host promised political and moral support.
</P>
<P>
Louis Farrakhan, leader of a 31-member delegation (including
Farrakhan's wife) of the Nation of Islam from the United States,
said at a press conference tonight that he wanted to bring about
a political change through the mobilization of all those who were
disenchanted with the existing political parties in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
"Our plan is to continue mobilizing our people and form the
third political force to bring about an effective political change
in the United States," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he wanted to use the Holy Koran to bring about changes
in the minds of the American people and the people themselves
would then bring about the necessary changes.
</P>
<P>
Farrakhan, who arrived here Saturday, took part in the
celebrations of the 17th anniversary of the victory of the
Islamic Revolution here.
</P>
<P>
His four-day trip to Iran is part of a 23-country tour aimed
at winning political, moral and financial assistance from mainly
Moslem countries.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi has already
promised 1 billion U.S. dollars to help Farrakhan mobilize the
non-white poor in a bid to to create a third political force.
</P>
<P>
However, Iran denied that there was any promise of financial
help to the Nation of Islam.
</P>
<P>
Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, a hardliner known for his support of
Moslem radical groups around the world, told Xinhua today that
Iran "would support, as before, the Nation of Islam, morally and
politically" but he added that "there are no promise of financial
help as yet."
</P>
<P>
Jannati said Farrakhan met with President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani but he denied that there was any meeting between the
leader of the Nation of Islam and Iran's Supreme Leader Ali
Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Farrakhan visited the northeastern city
of Mashhad, the historical city of Isfahan, the holy city of
Qom. He is expected to leave Iran Wednesday morning for Iraq. He
will also visit Syria, Turkey and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Observers here note that his visit has inspired the Iranian
radicals to mobilize their resources to "resume the exportation
of the Islamic Revolution."
</P>
<P>
Referring to Farrakhan's overt support for the Islamic
Revolution, Rafsanjani told hundreds of thousands of revolution's
supporters Sunday that Iran was not ashamed to admit that the
Islamic Revolution had been exported.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iranian authorities were cautious about giving too
much coverage to Farrakhan's appearances and speeches in Iran in
order to avoid religious arguments with Farrakhan.
</P>
<P>
Religious orthodoxy in the Moslem world has been at odds with
the Nation of Islam for accepting Honorable Elijah Muhammad as
the last messenger of Allah. Moslems, as a rule, consider Prophet
Muhammad as the last messenger to mankind.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference tonight, Farrakhan attacked those
Moslems who criticize his movement.
</P>
<P>
"Some of you who criticize us take Washington D.C. as your idol
and kneel before Clinton, as if he were God," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Moslems had no right to judge the righteousness
of his group because the "Allah was the only judge."
</P>
<P>
"Anyone of you who wants to put on the robe of Allah, I can
assure you that the robe won't fit you well," he said.

LONDON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Albert Reynolds, former Irish

LONDON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John
Major is working on a consultation paper on the elected body which
he wanted to lead to all-party talks on the future of Ulster, Ian
Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) in Northern
Ireland, said today.
</P>
<P>
The DUP leader, who strongly defends British rule over Ulster
and also bitterly opposes talks with Sinn Fein, had talks with
Major in Downing Street.

Emerging from one-hour meeting with the prime minister, Paisley
said that they discussed not just the elections plan, but also the
"proximity talks" proposal put forth by the Irish government and a
suggestion for a referendum made by the Social Democratic and
Labour Party which stands for reunification of Ulster with the
Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
But he held that it was now realistic to expect all-party talks
to be held after the elections.
</P>
<P>
He also revealed that Major had not ruled out other options
such as "proximity talks".
</P>
<P>
Downing Street announced this afternoon that it could not rule
out talks between government officials and Sinn Fein despite a ban
on ministerial contacts with the IRA's political wing.

TEHRAN, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Ali

rights against independent states.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with the visiting rapporteur of the U.N. Human

Iran's official news agency IRNA quoted Velayati as saying

He added that the big powers are exploiting and misusing the
human rights issue against the independent countries which do not
bow to their imposed policies.

Velayati also stressed the need to take into account of the
cultural differences among world countries.

CAIRO, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Unidentified gunmen killed one
person and injured another in Egypt today, the Middle East News
Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted a source at the Interior Ministry as saying
that the gunmen opened fire at a police station in Malawi, Minya,
about 260 kilometers south of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The security guards at the station returned fire at the
assailants, who shot indiscriminately while running away, MENA
said.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan Ibrahim Mohamed was killed and Souad Sadeq Barsoum
wounded by the attackers, according to MENA.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been haunted by terrorist attacks, especially in the
south, since 1992. Most of these attacks are believed to have been
carried out by Moslem fundamentalist militants who aim at toppling
the secular government and replacing it with strict Islamic rule.
</P>
<P>
President Hosni Mubarak said last month that the security
forces are winning a battle against terrorism in the country.
</P>

Also today, a state security court sentenced five Moslem
militants to prison at hard labor for killing two policemen in
Cairo in 1993.

ABU DHABI, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Bahraini Prime Minister
Sheikh Khalifa bin Sulman al Khalifa has expressed determination
to end violence in his country while inspecting a luxury hotel in
Manama where a home-made bomb exploded Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Two Bahrainis and a Sri Lankan were wounded when the bomb

his country is determined to fight against violence and sabotage
activities to safeguard security and stability of the country as
well as achievements obtained by Bahrain in recent years.
</P>

"Such attempts are designed to destabilize the whole Arab Gulf
region," Sheikh Fahim was quoted by today's local daily Emirates

<HEADLINE> Mideast Countries Plan to Import Water from Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Israel, Egypt, Jordan and
Palestine are planing to form a consortium in a bid to buy water
from Turkey, the Turkish Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted a report by the Israeli government,
entitled "Development Alternatives for Cooperation in the Middle
East and East Mediterranean Region 1996" as saying: "By the year
2000, water demand will increase by 30 percent in the
region. This amount will be doubled by 2030 and the water
scarcity will turn into a crisis."
</P>
<P>
The report warns that the low level of water resources in the
region are alarming.
</P>
<P>
"Almost three out of four acres of land from Morocco to Iraq
are becoming desert. In many Arab countries, especially in Syria,
water is sold for cheap prices and no priorities in usage are
set. Thus, there is no strategy on developing water resources or
the consumption of water," said the report.
</P>
<P>
It urges developing a "strategy on water" as a minimum of 900
million U.S. dollars in annual spending is required to overcome
the problem.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Arab League called for the signing of a just
agreement that guarantees the rights of Syria and Iraq to share
the waters of the Euphrates.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Syrian government sent a memorandum to the league
asking for the dispute, over the sharing of the waters of the
Euphrates, to be discussed at its ministerial council, due to
meet in Cairo on March 13.
</P>
<P>
Syria is calling for the signing of a permanent water-sharing
agreement with Turkey to replace a provisional accord requiring
Turkey to allow the flow of 500 cubic meters of water to Syria
per second.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Community of Golan Heights Demands Israeli Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Syrian Community of the
Golan Heights today expressed its support for the Syrian
government in demanding a full withdrawal from the strategic
plateau.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued at a press conference in
Jerusalem, the Arabs of Syrian nationalities in the Golan Heights
also stand for a full Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon
and for the formation of an independent Palestinian state with
Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
"These demands represent the entire Syrian nation, especially
the residents of the occupied Golan Heights," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"During 29 years of occupation, the Israeli establishment has
attempted to eradicate the Syrian-Arab identity of the five
villages which remained in the Golan after the 1967 war," said
the statement, adding, however, that these attempts have met with
"complete failure."
</P>
<P>
The statement said: "Under Israeli authority in 1967, more than
139 villages were destroyed in the Golan and more than 130,000
inhabitants displaced. Today, Israel continues to oppress the
people of the Golan and to distort and misrepresent our
legitimate resistance to occupation."
</P>
<P>
"Since the onset of Israeli rule in the territories of 1967, we
have resisted occupation with all the means at our disposal," it
said. "This resistance has enabled us to preserve our Arab
identity and our Syrian nationality, as well as part of our lands
and our existence in the Golan."
</P>
<P>
Speakers at the press conference included Dr. Suleiman Breik,
executive committee member of the Association of Academics in the
Golan, and Dr. Tayseer Mar'i, director of the Arab Association
for Development.
</P>
<P>
It was learned that there are 17,000 non-Jewish people in the
Golan now.

<HEADLINE> Cholera Spreads To Central Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Cholera which broke out in
northern Zambia last month has spread to Kabwe in the Central
Province, where six cases have been reported to the Kabwe General
Hospital, a provincial official disclosed today.
</P>
<P>
The Acting Permanent Secretary of the provincial government,
Godrey Akafekwa, said in Kabwe that he has received reports about
the outbreak of cholera in the central town, which has killed one
person.
</P>
<P>
"However, there is no cause for alarm because the situation is
manageable. The people should not panic, because the medical
authorities have taken measures to contain the situation,"
Akafekwa said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kabwe Mayor James Chansa cautioned local residents
to be careful and maintain their surroundings clean to stop the
disease from further spreading.
</P>
<P>
People should check on their visitors as the disease is easily
spread by travelers, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The first case of cholera in Kabwe was detected on February 6
when a suspected cholera patient from the town's Makandanyama
Shanty Compound was taken to hospital for treatment.

<HEADLINE> Former Government Officials' Trial Adjourned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Central High Court of
Ethiopia today adjourned until April 4 the hearing of evidence to
be presented by the special prosecutor against former government
officials.
</P>
<P>
The adjournment was made because of the inability of the
special prosecutor to gather and present evidence and that of the
defendants to stand trial for health reasons.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor told the court that he had done everything
possible to respect the appointment, but was not able to gather
all the necessary information due to the work load.
</P>
<P>
The trial of the 66 former government officials and military
officers, including former President Mengistu Haile-Mariam,
started on December 13, 1994. They are accused of genocide and
crime against humanity.
</P>
<P>
Of these people, 45 were brought into dock. Those tried in
absentia include Mengistu, who is living in exile in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The last trial began on November 28, 1995, and was adjourned
until February 13, 1996.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa To Further Relax Exchange Controls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The improvement in the
balance of payments justifies a further relaxation on exchange
controls in South Africa in 1996, Reserve Bank Governor Chris
Stals said today.
</P>
<P>
Stals told a press conference in Cape Town that a situation is
developing where excessive capital inflows are contributing to
the inflationary pressures on the domestic economy.
</P>
<P>
"Some fine balance must now be struck between the need to
increase the official foreign reserves to a more comfortable
level, and the desire to relax the exchange control restrictions
on residents," Stals said.
</P>
<P>
However, Finance Minister Chris Liebenberg indicated earlier
in the day that no time frame has been set for the loosening of
exchange controls although they would be relaxed over a period of
time.
</P>
<P>
Stals emphasized that a stable financial environment remains
the main objective of South Africa's monetary policy and the
country has to maintain low inflation and a stable exchange rate
for the Rand.
</P>
<P>
"In such an environment, real economic growth at the maximum
possible level will be sustainable throughout 1996, and also in
the longer term," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, projections by the Reserve Bank's economic
department indicate that the well-balanced macro-economic
situation of 1995 could be sustained throughout 1996.

<HEADLINE> Bio Supports Elections on February 26 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, February 13 (Xinhua) -- the head of state, brigadier
Julius Maada Bio today assured the nation over state radio that
"presidential and parliamentary elections shall be held
throughout Sierra Leone on February 26, 1996."
</P>
<P>
He made the move after a National conference voted on Monday
for multi-party elections in the country to go ahead as planned
on February 26, rejecting calls for polling to be put off.
</P>
<P>
The broadcast made from the state house and carried live said
Bio "will do all" in his "power to ensure a smooth transfer of
power to a democratically elected civilian government."
</P>
<P>
Bio said he has "ordered the chief of defence staff to ensure
that within the limited resources we shall now put at his
disposal, security to be maintained throughout."
</P>
<P>
He noted that there is "an herculean task considering the
situation on the ground but it is also one he and his officers
have this morning promised to undertake honourably and
unreservedly."
</P>
<P>
Bio called on "all serving military personnel to be extra
vigilant and remember that the people whom we serve have chosen
and our duty is to protect their choice."
</P>
<P>
He warned party activists that "any attempt to incite or
create disturbances during this period will be seriously dealt
with."
</P>
<P>
"I only ask that the door to peace which has been opened is
not closed or forgotten in the race for power."
</P>
<P>
He pledged to "continue the peace and reconciliation" which
Bio said "is so vital for democracy till" his last day as head of
state.
</P>
<P>
Bio's broadcast laid to rest worries as to whether the
military government is going to accept the majority vote on
Monday by delegates at the one-day conference that the elections
should go ahead as scheduled on February 26, in 13 days time.
</P>
<P>
A total of 56 political parties and civilian groups were in
favor of maintaining the election date, while 14 said the
military government should first negotiate peace with rebels of
the revolutionary united front which advocates the postponement
of the elections.

LONDON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. entertainment giant Time
Waner and British broadcaster MAI will jointly invest 344 million

<HEADLINE> Wages and Benefits Rise Slowly in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- American workers' wages,
salaries and benefits rose 2.9 percent last year, the smallest
annual increase in the past dozen years and more, U.S. Labour
Department reported here today.
</P>
<P>
In announcing the yearly Employment Cost Index, it said that
the index is lower than the previous yearly low in 1994 which was
3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The index is considered one of the best gauges of wage
inflation pressures since compensation represents about two-thirds
of the cost of a product.
</P>
<P>
Consumer prices rose 2.5 percent in U.S. last year.
</P>
<P>
The report said employment costs for workers in private
industry increased 2.8 percent in 1995, down from 3.1 percent in
the previous year. Compensation cost gains rose 3 percent in
service industries, up from 2.9 percent in 1994. It increased 2.5
percent in goods-producing industries, much lower than the 3.1
percent rise in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Job growth had been relatively modest during much of the
recovery from the 1990-91 recession. That, combined with continued
business restructuring and downsizing, has provided workers with
little leverage to seek increased wages and benefits.
</P>
<P>
Wages and salaries of American workers -- nearly three-fourths
of total compensation -- rose 2.9 percent, up from 2.8 percent
during 1994 but less than the 3.1 percent gain in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Benefit costs were up just 2.8 percent, down from 3.4 percent a
year earlier and the smallest gain since that series began, also
in 1982.
</P>
<P>
The Labour Department said the index rose a seasonally adjusted
0.9 percent during the final three months of 1995, up from 0.6
percent during the previous quarter. It was the largest increase
since a 0.9 percent gain in March 1993.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Labour Department has been tracking the changes of
Employment Cost Index in the Country since 1982.

<HEADLINE> No Easy Job at HKFA Special Council Meeting  (by Sportswriter Zongxin Zhou) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 13 (Xinhua) -- There seems to be nobody in
the soccer circle of Hong Kong who looks forward an easy job at
the special council meeting of the Hong Kong Football Association
(HKFA) here tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was aimed at settling down the existing problems
between the HKFA and a breakaway group consisting of the 10 First
Division clubs.
</P>
<P>
In its two statements issued earlier, the group, called the
Association of Hong Kong Professional Football Clubs (AHKPFC),
claimed that the professional football in Hong Kong has been
wrongly managed "by a group of amateurs" and that this had caused
the sharp decline of Hong Kong's football standard of play and
considerable financial loss on the side of the First Division
clubs.
</P>
<P>
The senior clubs demanded to have a larger say in the
management of the sport in Hong Kong and asked the HKFA to help
them decrease what they had claimed to be millions HK dollars
annual loss.
</P>
<P>
And at a point, they challenged the HKFA by threatening to
boycott the Carlsberg Cup Lunar New Year meet which falls on next
Monday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the rebel group said they would agree to let their
players to the training group for the Carlsberg Cup should they
were given a bigger share of the profit from the meet.
</P>
<P>
And the Hong Kong team named last week by the HKFA without
prior consulting with the senior clubs has being training these
day for meet.
</P>
<P>
But an unofficial if not anonymous letter with the HKFA
letter-head and the company chop caused a new wave of storm, even
from inside the Association itself. The letter was in fact a
peace proposal from the HKFA to settle down the disputes with the
senior clubs.
</P>
<P>
Faxed to the media from the HKFA headquarters last weekend, the
two-paged letter was later confirmed to be ordered to release by
HKFA president Stewart Lee Leung-nang. But two of HKFA
vice-presidents said they had not known of the letter.
</P>
<P>
And the AHKPFC reacted coolly. Its spokesman Ken Ng Kin
described the contents of the letter "unproductive". An offer of
60 to 70 percent from the Partnership Program proposed by the
letter would still end up losing money.
</P>
<P>
"We the clubs, have decided it was not enough," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Bank Loans to Overseas-Funded Companies Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- By the end of last year, the
balance of loans by Chinese financial institutions to
overseas-funded enterprises in China had topped 99.56 billion
yuan, 20 billion yuan more than it was by the end of 1994,
statistics from the People's Bank of China show.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also show that China has so far approved nearly
259,000 overseas-funded projects and has used 135.4 billion
U.S. dollars in overseas funds.
</P>
<P>
At present, over 120,000 overseas-funded companies are doing
business in China.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from China's State Taxation Administration show that
overseas-funded companies and foreign companies in China paid more
than 7.5 billion yuan in income taxes last year, 57 percent more
than in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Half of the renminbi loans that overseas-funded companies got
were from the Bank of China, which provided over 69 billion yuan
in loans in 1995 alone, and also more than four billion
U.S. dollars in loans in foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the Bank of China had provided 21
billion U.S. dollars in loans in foreign currency and 259 billion
yuan in loans.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Demands Apology From Japan on Islet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 13 (Xinhua) -- A committee of the South Korean
parliament demanded today that Japan apologize for claiming
sovereignty over Tokto Islet in the East Sea (Sea of Japan).
</P>
<P>
Japan's claim constitutes a violation of the Korean
sovereignty, said the Unification and Foreign Committee of the
National Assembly in a resolution, adding that historically Tokto
has been an inherent part of the South Korean territory.
</P>
<P>
The committee demanded that the Japanese government make an
apology over the claim if it wants to maintain good-neighborly
relations with South Korea and safeguard peace in Northeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
It also urged the South Korean government to take firm measures
to prevent possible recurrence of similar incidents over the Tokto
issue.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda said last Friday that
the islet, which is called Takeshima by the Japanese, is part of
the Japanese territory and the construction by South Korea of
docking facilities on the islet is an infringement of Japan's
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda's remarks were made two days after an announcement of
South Korea that it will build a wharf on the
0.186-square-kilometer islet about midway between South Korea and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
The dispute over Tokto began when reports said that Japan was
preparing to declare a 200-nautical mile (370 kilometer) exclusive
economic zone around its shores, which would include the islet.
Seoul's plan for a wharf is apparently an attempt to block any
Japanese move.
</P>
<P>
Japanese coast guard ships routinely appear near the islet in
an apparent attempt to claim its ownership.

<HEADLINE> Insurance Brokerages Growing in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Insurance broking has become a
booming business in China.
</P>
<P>
And as the sustained growth of insurance broking continues
through the '90s the need for new rules and regulations has been
stressed by officials.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen, a special economic zone in south China's Guangdong
Province, established 16 insurance brokerages in 1993 and a year
later the number had risen to more than 20.
</P>
<P>
They include publicly-owned entities and non-government
companies.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong, has established Gongli, Yifeng
and other insurance brokerages. They have introduced about 30
percent of foreign-related non-marine coverage provided by the
Guangdong Branch of the People's Insurance Company of China (PICC).
</P>
<P>
Beijing has Huatai and Antai insurance consultation (broking)
companies, both sponsored by the Beijing Branch of PICC, China's
No.1 underwriter.
</P>
<P>
In Shenzhen there are two committees to coordinate insurance
coverage on cars and property and also to research on brokering in
those fields. The committees are expected to draft disciplinary
regulations for insurance brokers.
</P>
<P>
China's insurance broking business has entered a new stage of
growth since the Law on Insurance went into effect last October,
said a scholar with the China Institute of Insurance.
</P>
<P>
China first announced regulations for brokers last November.
</P>
<P>
"The regulations will standardize insurance brokers before
special regulations on insurance brokers are unveiled," said the
scholar..
</P>
<P>
"China will have large group of insurance brokers offering
different policies, and they will have to obtain professional
credentials while they are doing domestic broking.
</P>
<P>
"The People's Bank of China, the central bank, will make more
efforts to regulate those insurance brokers, whose irregular
actions will be corrected," she said.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen has drawn up a series of insurance broking rules,
which stipulate that commissions should not exceed 15 percent
of premiums.
</P>
<P>
"Development will be seen in re-insurance broking, however,
those broking activities involved in agriculture and export
credit, which are almost unprofitable, will decrease," she
said.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin's Spokesman Denies Kremlin Ban for NTV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 13 (Xinhua) -- A Russian official today denied
that Russia's independent NTV television had been barred from
access to the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
President Boris Yeltsin's Press Secretary Sergei Medvedev said
that he was astonished at the allegations that the Kremlin's doors
were closed for NTV. Nobody has deprived NTV reporters of access
to events taking place in the Kremlin, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
In its news program on Monday, NTV complained that its
reporters were not allowed to the Kremlin after the company aired
an interview with Yeltsin's former Press Secretary Vyacheslav
Kostikov, who used the interview to criticize Yeltsin and his
closest advisers.
</P>
<P>
Medvedev branded as "very strange" the NTV reaction to the fact
that its filming crew were not admitted to "one or two events
attended by Yeltsin." He said that it was a common practice that
the number and composition of reporters varied on different
occasions concerning President Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
According to Medvedev, neither the NTV leadership nor its
reporters tried to contact him before presenting accusations of
"some ill thoughts" against the company.
</P>
<P>
NTV's move looks like "an ad to increase the company's
ranking," the spokesman said, noting: "It is very sad if NTV has
chosen these ways to enlarge the number of its viewers."
</P>
<P>
On Monday, NTV reported that the presidential press service
informed NTV in a telephone call Monday morning that it would no
longer be allowed inside the epicenter of Russian power.
</P>
<P>
NTV has been reportedly threatened by the Kremlin before, and
they were told they could lose their broadcast license during the
network's aggressive coverage of the war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"They can't seize our license, that is a very long legal
process that can't be finished by June," said NTV's
editor-in-chief Oleg Dobrodeyev, referring to the date for
presidential elections.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Six more bodies were fished
out of Jakarta city rivers, bringing the death toll to 13 in the
weekend floods, the Evening Press said today.
</P>
<P>
The flood starting last Friday inundated 139 of Jakarta's 265
subdistricts, and flooded buildings housing 134,354 families or
566,542 people, the report quoted Governor Surjadi Soedirdja as
saying.
</P>
<P>
With the water level as high as one meter, several areas in the
capital are still submerged. Abandoned cars are a common sight in
some areas.
</P>
<P>
Traffic congestion was worsened by traffic lights that were
either turned off or damaged by the floods. The floods have also
affected the gas supply.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the 100,000 telephone lines destroyed by
the rains could not return to normal until two weeks later.
</P>
<P>
Governor Surjadi said Monday that the first stage of the city's
rehabilitation would be to repair the banks of the 13 rivers
running through Jakarta, where nearly half of the area is located
in lowlands.
</P>
<P>
The forecasting services at the Meteorological and Geophysical
Agency said that rains would continue until the end of this month.
 More rains are expected along the north Java coast, Sumatra,
Bali, Sulawesi and west and east Nusa Tenggara.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Indonesian House of Representatives Monday
questioned the flood-prevention system of the city and the lack of
infrastructure to cope with the situation.
</P>
<P>
They urged the government to do whatever was necessary to solve
the problem of floods in the country's capital.

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senate Majority Leader
and GOP presidential front-runner Bob Dole is preparing for a more
fierce fight in New Hampshire's primary election after a slim
victory in the Iowa caucuses on Monday, the first full-scale U.S.
presidential preference vote of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The final results of the caucuses showed that 72-year-old Dole
won 26 percent support from the state's 130,000 Republican voters.
But he was not a very strong candidate to face President Bill
Clinton, unopposed among his fellow Democrats, in the U.S.
presidential elections on November 5.
</P>
<P>
Conservative commentator Pat Buchanan, buoyed by the Christian
right, finished a strong second in the Iowa poll, trailed by
moderate Lamar Alexander, whose showing was stronger than had been
expected by analysts.
</P>
<P>
Multimillionaire publisher Steve Forbes, who spent some 4
million U.S. dollars in the Iowa campaigns, edged Senator Phil
Gramm for fourth.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts regarded the outcome as a setback for Dole, who
had sought a wider margin of victory in Iowa, a farming state near
his native Kansas. Dole is making his third run for the
presidency.

<HEADLINE> Religious Groups Urged to Preserve National Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese leader said
here today that religious groups in China should safeguard the
sanctity of the law, people's interests, and unity of different
ethnic groups and the nation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a gathering of religious leaders to greet the
forthcoming Spring Festival, Li Ruihuan, member of the Standing
Committee of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party
(CPC) Central Committee, said that this is a basic requirement of
the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese government, the
consensus of both religious leaders and their followers, and the
code of conduct that all religious groups and believers must
observe.
</P>
<P>
He said that facts show that upholding the basic requirement
will be conducive to completely implementing the country's
policies on freedom of religious beliefs, safeguarding the
legitimate rights, interests, and status of religious groups and
normally conducting religious activities.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin and Premier Li
Peng, Li Ruihuan, also chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, expressed the
gratitude and extended greetings for the Lunar New Year to the
leaders of various patriotic religious organizations and religious
believers.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the country's 1996-2000 economic and social
development plan and that through the year 2010 are in the
interests of the people throughout the country, including
religious believers.
</P>
<P>
Li said religious groups should make an effort to promote unity
between religious believers and those who are not religious
believers and lead religious believers in contributing to the
reforms and opening to the outside world, and to modernizations.
</P>
<P>
Li said he hopes that religious believers will carry forward
the fine patriotic tradition and make greater contributions to the
country's material and cultural progress.
</P>
<P>
Among those present at the gathering were Ding Guangxun,
chairman of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee of the
Protestant Churches of China and chairman of China Christian
Council, An Shiwei, chairman of the Islamic Association of China,
Ming Yang, vice-chairman of the Buddhist Association of China,
Zong Huaide, chairman of the Chinese Catholic Bishops College and
Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association, and Fu Yuantian, chairman
of the China Daoist Association.
</P>
<P>
The religious leaders expressed their gratitude to the central
authorities for their attention to religious affairs and put
forward some suggestions that included dealing with public
security and corruption.
</P>
<P>
They also expressed their willingness to make a greater
contribution to unity of ethnic groups and to national unity.

DHAKA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The rail-road-waterways blockade
called by the Bangladeshi opposition today paralyzed the transport
across the country.
</P>
<P>
All trains from the Dhaka station in the morning were stopped
on the way because of the blockade while no trains moved at all in
the eastern and western parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Long-distance buses and motor vehicles were absent in the
streets of Dhaka, where a large number of cycle rickshaws and
autorickshaws were plying.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that some autorickshaws were set ablaze by
opposition activists after they clashed with the police in some
areas.
</P>
<P>
Movement of vehicles at night remained thin after the blockade
ended in the early evening.
</P>
<P>
The mainstream opposition parties staged the blockade in a bid
to press home their demand for cancellation of the February 15
national election.
</P>
<P>
While the ruling party has got ready for the polls, the
opposition parties have announced their determination to boycott
the election at any cost.
</P>
<P>
They have planned to observe a 48-hour nationwide strike on
February 14-15 as part of the efforts to boycott what they call

<HEADLINE> Jakarta to Launch University Accreditation System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
launch an accreditation system to regulate universities, the local
reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The accreditation system set up by the National Accreditation
Board will come into effect this July, Chairman of the board
Sukadji Ranuwihardjo said at a hearing with the House of
Representatives Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said that 1,408 Indonesian universities with more than 5,000
study programs will undergo the accreditation process in the first
semester of the 1996-97 school year.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the universities will be graded based on the
quality, efficiency and relevance of their study programs.
</P>
<P>
The accreditation system was tested at 10 state-owned
universities and five private ones last year.
</P>
<P>
Study programs at Indonesia's private universities were
formerly either labeled as "equivalent" to similar programs at
state universities, or merely "registered" at the Ministry of
Education and Culture.
</P>
<P>
The system was often criticized as being open to manipulation.
</P>
<P>
Universities that fail to meet the standard will be labeled
non-accredited while those accredited will be given "A" for the

BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- A lingering spell of warm, dry

growing areas, scientists at the Chinese Academy of Meteorological
Sciences and Chinese Central Meteorological Station have said.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government
said today that it is determined to reform the taxation system by
broadening the tax base and reducing the incidence of taxation
progressively.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet meeting today formed a committee to look into
various proposals in detail to further improve the taxation
policy, Information Minister Khalid Kharal told a press briefing
here.
</P>

number of people are paying taxes," he said, adding that
"meanwhile, the incidence of taxation is higher than other
countries in the world."
</P>

be done without cutting the government revenue.

The cabinet meeting also decided to streamline the staff at
Pakistani embassies abroad.

KATHMANDU, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government today
initiated a new development program throughout the country aiming
at increasing people's direct participation in local development.
</P>
<P>
The program based on people's participation introduced by the
Local Development Ministry would motivate local people to be
directly involved in development works and extend government
assistance to projects launched by the people, officials of the
ministry said earlier.
</P>
<P>
Guidelines for the new development program had already been
dispatched to all villages, towns and districts of the country,

construction and land preservation in backward communities would
be implemented in rural areas, while in municipality areas new
infrastructure projects and women income generation programs would
be introduced.

In accordance with the guidelines for the program, local people
will bear 30 percent of the cost of rural projects and the
government will be responsible for the rest.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government will provide grant assistance for
development projects in municipalities provided that local
residents and municipal governments bear 40 and 30 percent of the
cost respectively.
</P>
<P>
Arrangements have been made to give priority to the projects in
which the cost borne by local people exceeds the specified
percentage, the ministry said.

<HEADLINE> No Easy Job at HKFA Special Council Meeting (by Sportswriter Zongxin Zhou) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 13 (Xinhua) -- There seems to be nobody in
the soccer circle of Hong Kong who looks forward no easy job at
the special council meeting of the Hong Kong Football Association
(HKFA) here tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was aimed at settling down the existing problems
between the HKFA and a breakaway group consisting of the 10 First
Division clubs.
</P>
<P>
In its two statements issued earlier, the group, called the
Association of Hong Kong Professional Football Clubs (AHKPFC),
claimed that the professional football in Hong Kong has been
wrongly managed "by a group of amateurs" and that this had caused
the sharp decline of Hong Kong's football standard of play and
considerable financial loss on the side of the First Division
clubs.
</P>
<P>
The senior clubs demanded to have a larger say in the
management of the sport in Hong Kong and asked the HKFA to help
them decrease what they had claimed to be millions HK dollars
annual loss.
</P>
<P>
And at a point, they challenged the HKFA by threatening to
boycott the Carlsberg Cup Lunar New Year meet which falls on next
Monday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the rebel group said they would agree to let their
players to the training group for the Carlsberg Cup should they
were given a bigger share of the profit from the meet.
</P>
<P>
And the Hong Kong team named last week by the HKFA without
prior consulting with the senior clubs has being training these
day for meet.
</P>
<P>
But an unofficial if not anonymous letter with the HKFA
letter-head and the company chop caused a new wave of storm, even
from inside the Association itself. The letter was in fact a
peace proposal from the HKFA to settle down the disputes with the
senior clubs.
</P>
<P>
Faxed to the media from the HKFA headquarters last weekend, the
two-paged letter was later confirmed to be ordered to release by
HKFA president Stewart Lee Leung-nang. But two of HKFA
vice-presidents said they had not known of the letter.
</P>
<P>
And the AHKPFC reacted coolly. Its spokesman Ken Ng Kin
described the contents of the letter "unproductive". An offer of
60 to 70 percent from the Partnership Program proposed by the
letter would still end up losing money.
</P>
<P>
"We the clubs, have decided it was not enough," he said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Says Japan Wants Filipino Seamen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Japanese shipping companies
have a great demand for Filipino seamen whom they regard as
"highly skilled and having good working relationship with other
crewmen," an official of the Philippine Overseas Employment
Administration (POEA) said today.
</P>
<P>
POEA chief Felicisimo Joson said that as of 1995, some 24,000
Filipino seamen were employed on board Japanese-controlled
vessels.
</P>
<P>
He said that the strong demand for Filipino seafarers by
Japanese shipping companies is an indication of the dwindling
supply of Japanese seafarers.
</P>
<P>
Japan's interest in Filipino seamen has led to its involvement
in maritime training and upgrading of Filipino seafarers.
</P>
<P>
Joson said that Filipino seamen will continue to be competitive
on the international market.

<HEADLINE> Biography of Li Peiyao (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Li Peiyao, as a patriot, was very concerned about the
reunification of the motherland. He published many articles and
made speeches on the subject, showing his deep-rooted longing for
the reunification.
</P>
<P>
He adhered to the "One China" stance and helped publicize the
"one country, two systems" and "peaceful reunification" principles.
</P>
<P>
He did a great deal of work for the peaceful reunification of
the motherland by contacting many friends and relatives in Taiwan
and overseas through his father's connections and influence, and
introduced the domestic situation to them.
</P>
<P>
He once proposed to the Kuomintang leaders in Taiwan that they
should follow the teachings of Sun Yat-sen, increase cross-straits
cooperation and promote the development of the cross-straits ties
for the peaceful reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Two days before he was murdered, he presided over a seminar
commemorating the first anniversary of the publication of Jiang
Zemin's important speech on the Taiwan issue, organized by the
central committees of the eight non-communist parties and the
All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce.
</P>
<P>
He fully supported the stance of the CPC and the Chinese
government on the Taiwan issue, and was resolutely opposed to the
conspiracies of "two Chinas," "one China, one Taiwan," and "Taiwan
independence."
</P>
<P>
He always believed that "the reunification of China represents
an inevitable historical trend, and can not be obstructed by any
force."
</P>
<P>
Li Peiyao paid much attention to friendship work with foreign
countries. He had headed many delegations to visit other
countries, had contacts with people from all walks of life, and
made active contributions to strengthening friendly exchanges with
parliaments and people of other countries.
</P>
<P>
Li Peiyao had been earnest in studying the theories of Maxism,
Leninism, the works of Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping's theory on
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and putting the
theories into actual practices.
</P>
<P>
He was conscientious about his work, and loved and cherished
every job he was assigned to. His work style was democratic, clean
and honest, his life style simple.
</P>
<P>
Li Peiyao spent all of his life loving the motherland, working
for the prosperity and reunification of the motherland, and serving
the people whole-heartedly.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of China has lost a close comrade-in-arms
and the RCCK has lost an outstanding leader, and the State and the
people have lost a good cadre, and a good leader by Li's death.

<HEADLINE> Biography of Li Peiyao (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Li Peiyao was enthusiastic about the work of the RCCK, and he
made great efforts to encourage it to participate more in the
country's political affairs. As a result, the committee achieved
much progress.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, led and organized by Li, the RCCK has submitted a
large number of valuable suggestions to the CPC Central Committee
and the State Council. These included suggestions related to
helping the poor, curbing inflation, carrying out social security
reforms, keeping the flow of rural surplus labor force in good
order, coordinating development in different areas, and diverting
water from the south to the north.
</P>
<P>
Li Peiyao was an outstanding representative of Chinese
intellectuals who served the people with their hearts and souls.
</P>
<P>
He loved the motherland and the people, and was always ready to
work at grassroots units. He worked for 30 years in the Nanchang
Aircraft Manufacturing Company, in east China's Jiangxi Province.
</P>
<P>
He was keen to pore over technical problems. Many of his
academic papers and books were published and he took part in the
development and design of some new models of planes. Many times he
was commended as a well-versed technical specialist.
</P>
<P>
Working at leading positions at the Ministry of Labor and the
All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Li showed great concern for
workers, and put forward many important suggestions with regard to
reforms on employment, wages and social security systems.
</P>
<P>
In particular, he put much emphasis on safeguarding legitimate
rights and interests of laborers, including on-the-job protection
for workers.
</P>
<P>
Li hated law-violating conduct very much, and strongly
advocated introduction of new laws and perfection of laws.
</P>
<P>
Early on the morning of February 2 when an intruder sneaked
into his house to attempt a theft, Li scolded him severely. In
face of the intruder's knife, Li Peiyao, though in his sixties,
fought bravely with the merciless intruder, and unfortunately was
killed by the intruder.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Underscores Efforts to Stop Teenage Smoking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
discussed smoking problems with an activist group of anti-smoking
teenagers on Monday to underscore the president's drive against
teenage smoking.
</P>
<P>
Last August, the president declared nicotine, the major killer
in cigarettes, to be a drug and authorized the Food and Drug
Administration to regulate the sales of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
He also ordered a crackdown on cigarette vending machines and
on cigarette advertising to protect children.
</P>
<P>
During the 20-minute discussion with seven students and three
adults in the Oval Office, the president was briefed on a hands-on
survey conducted by three of the teenagers to test how often
stores were willing to sell them cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
"More than half actually would sell to us," said Christy
Franco, 17, a student at Oakton High School in Vienna, Virginia,
who went to about 20 stores in one day, gasoline stations and
convenience stores, and asked for cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
The youngsters also tested 12 vending machines. Ricky Lovelace,
also 17, of Robinson Secondary School in Fairfax, Virginia, said
they would have been able to get cigarettes from 11 without anyone
stopping them.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he is considering banning cigarette vending
machines in any place that children have access to.
</P>
<P>
"If you're going to have vending machines, then maybe they
should just be where only adults can come in," Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Zairean Soldiers Deployed around Rwandan Refugee Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Zairean troops ringed a
Rwandan refugee camp in eastern Zaire early today, starting an
operation to pressure a million refugees to go home voluntarily,
a report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers with rifles were seen moving to a road on the
perimeter of Kibumba camp near the eastern Zairean town of Goma
as thousands of refugees stood and climbed to hills inside the
camp to see what they were doing.
</P>
<P>
The refugees fled Rwanda in 1994 after a civil war broke out
in the country following the downing of a plane which killed the
Rwandan president, a Hutu. Hutu troops, militiamen and radicals
took revenge on minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus, killing half
a million people.
</P>
<P>
And about two million Hutus fled to Zaire and Tanzania after
government troops were defeated in the civil war.
</P>
<P>
No violence has been reported so far after the operation
began. Other troops of a 1,500-strong Zairean camp contingent
formed last year took key positions and junctions inside Kibumba
to keep law and order.
</P>
<P>
But refugees said they are adamant and would stay on in
Kibumba, a camp which has accommodated about 190,000 Rwandan
Hutus despite the Zairean plan to encourage them to leave and to
close down progressively some 40 camps in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"The Zaireans have been talking about this operation for weeks
now... Our leaders told us to remain passive. We will stay here
and UNHCR (the U.N. refugee agency) will continue to feed us," a
refugee was quoted as saying.

</P>
<P>
During today's meeting, Qian Qichen, Chinese vice premier and

and cooperation progress had been made on issues of language,
public servants, the law, and participation in international
organizations during the transition period.
</P>

further cooperation between the two continents, and will be
helpful to international relations, as well as peace, stability,
and development in the world.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Direct Foreign Investment Increases in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan received 450
million US dollars in direct foreign investment during the first
six months of the current 1995-96 fiscal year, a senior official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
"This is more than the total direct foreign investment of 430
million dollars in 1994-95," Mohibullah Shah, secretary of the
Board of Investment, told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Despite various difficulties, the inflow of foreign direct
investment, especially in the sectors of construction and
manufacturing, is rising continuously, he said.
</P>
<P>
Shah told the newsmen that Pakistan continues its dialogue with
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to press for the resumption
of the incentive package for the Special Industrial Zones (SIZ).
</P>
<P>
The package brought two billion dollars worth of foreign direct
investment in the SIZs last year. But it lasted only eight months
and was withdrawn recently under the pressure of IMF.
</P>
<P>
"If continued for another five years, this package would be
able to attract 10 to 15 billion dollars worth of foreign
investment in the country, and we hope we will be able to have it
resumed," Shah said.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that Pakistan would hold the first ever
regional economic summit in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Heads of governments from Central Asia and South Asia are
expected to participate in the conference and identify areas of
cooperation in the region," he added.

<HEADLINE> Biography of Li Peiyao (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Li Peiyao, vice-chairman of
the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC),
chairman of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee
of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), a close friend of the Communist
Party of China (CPC), a well-known patriot and political activist,
died in Beijing on February 2, 1996, at the age of 63.
</P>
<P>
Born in Hong Kong in 1933, Li graduated from the Beijing
Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics in 1957. Li served as a
teacher at the Nanchang Aviation School in Jiangxi Province from
1957 to 1958; a technician, engineer, chief engineer and senior
engineer of the Nanchang Aircraft Manufacturing Company from 1958
to 1987. After 1986, he served as vice-chairman of the RCCK
Jiangxi Provincial Committee, member of the Standing Committee and
vice-chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), member and a
standing committee member of the National Committee of the CPPCC,
vice-president and member of the Secretariat of the All-China
Federation of Trade Unions, vice-minister of labor, president of
the Chinese People's Association for Peace and Disarmament, member
of the China Council for the Promotion of Peaceful Reunification,
vice-chairman and chairman of the RCCK Central Committee, and
vice-chairman of the 8th NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Li was a son of Li Jishen, a well-known patriotic general, a
democratic revolutionary, a founder of the RCCK and a close friend
of the CPC.
</P>
<P>
Influenced by his father, Li Peiyao took it as his unswerving
political belief to accept the CPC leadership and take the
socialist road. In the new historical period and in the course of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, he took up
leading posts within the RCCK and the NPC, and made important
contributions to the improvement of the people's congress system
and the multi-party cooperation system and the political
consultative system under the CPC leadership. He also forged close
friendship with CPC leading officials.
</P>
<P>
Li had a profound understanding of the multi-party cooperation
system and the political consultative system under the CPC
leadership. He was of the view that the multi-party cooperation
system under the CPC leadership is an inevitable choice made by
history and that the RCCK is a product of striving for the
attainment of the common goal for the victory in China's new
democratic revolution in answer to the CPC call.
</P>
<P>
He proposed that during the new historical period,
non-Communist parties must stand two tests, i.e. the test of
long-term cooperation with the CPC and the test of assuming the
historical responsibility of the parties participating in managing
state affairs.
</P>
<P>
To this end, non-Communist parties must transform their
ideological concept and work mechanisms, and improve their work
styles, he said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized repeatedly that the RCCK must take effective
measures to improve its style of work, the quality of its members
and its organizational vitality, and improve the system under
which it operates as a party to participate in managing state
affairs.
</P>
<P>
He held that participating in the management of state affairs
and exercising democratic supervision are the basic functions of
the RCCK as a party to participate in managing state affairs.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, participating in managing state affairs means
making thorough investigations and putting forward proposals on
China's economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
Exercising democratic supervision means exercising supervision
currently in such vital issues as cracking down on corruption and
enacting and enforcing laws, acting as a close friend of the CPC
and accepting the CPC's supervision.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Rabbani Grand Alliance in Offing: Hekmatyar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Former Afghan Prime Minister
and Hezb-i-Islamic chief Gulbuddin Hekmatyar said here today that
the opposition groups are holding talks on the formation of a
grand alliance against President Burhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
"If Rabbani insists on fighting, then we will form a grand
alliance against him," Hekmatyar said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Describing the ongoing talks of Afghan leaders here as
"constructive," he said that the Hezb-i-Islami and the Supreme
Coordination Council are ready to form the alliance.
</P>
<P>
If the alliance is formed, then it is difficult for Rabbani to
stay even for a few days, he said.
</P>
<P>
"All the opposition groups demanded that Rabbani resign and
transfer power," he added.
</P>
<P>
"We hope something will come out," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that it was not easy to bring together
different groups and to resolve the problems the opposition groups
are facing.
</P>
<P>
He put forward four conditions for the solution of Afghan
crisis -- unconditional resignation of Rabbani, power transfer to
interim set-up, demilitarization of Kabul and holding of general
elections.
</P>
<P>
He told newsmen that the Supreme Coordination Council,
including the Hezb-i-Islami, the National Islamic Movement of
Rashid Dostum and the Hezb-i-Wahdat (Khalili Group), has reached
understanding that it would defend jointly if any party faces
attack from Rabbani's forces.
</P>
<P>
Hekmatyar invited Rabbani to hold talks with the opposition
even without resignation.
</P>
<P>
"We believe in negotiations," he said, "if Rabbani honestly
wants to come for talks, we are ready to welcome him."
</P>
<P>
He accused Russia, India and Iran of interfering in
Afghanistan's internal affairs by supporting the Kabul regime.
</P>
<P>
"We ask all the concerned parties to stop interfering in
Afghanistan and stop supplying weapons and ammunitions to the
Kabul regime," he said.
</P>
<P>
He could neither confirm nor deny when asked whether the
representatives of Taliban Islamic student militia have
participated in the ongoing talks in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
The top brass of the Supreme Coordination Council have been
meeting here for the last four days in a bid to forge the grand
alliance against Rabbani's regime.
</P>
<P>
The National Islamic movement of Pir Syed Ahmad Gillani and the
Afghan Islamic Revolutionary Movement headed by Nabi Muhammadi
also joined the high level meeting of the Afghan groups opposing
Rabbani's regime.
</P>
<P>
Uzbek leader General Rashid Dostum left today for Afghanistan
though the meeting is still going on. His representatives are
attending the discussion here.
</P>
<P>
A two-man team of the powerful Taliban Islamic student militia
arrived here Monday, but it was not known whether or not they
attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Taliban has no choice but to join us, Hekmatyar said.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to talk to the Taliban," he said, adding that
"we advice Taliban not to waste time. They alone cannot fight
against the Kabul Regime."
</P>
<P>
Hekmatyar ruled out any possibility of attack on Kabul in the
near future, but he said that preparations are going on for
fighting around Kabul, Herat and Farah provinces.
</P>
<P>
Hekmatyar, who met Pakistani Interior Minister Nasirullah Babar
here Monday, said he discussed the hardships of the Afghan
refugees in Pakistan with the minister.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani minister assured him that the Afghan refugees
would live in Pakistan as guests as long as the war continues in
Afghanistan, he added.

<HEADLINE> Dole Wins GOP Iowa Caucuses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senate Majority Leader
Bob Dole today won a clear-cut victory in the Iowa GOP caucuses,
the first major vote of the U.S. presidential campaign to select
Republican nominee to face Democratic President Bill Clinton in
November elections.
</P>
<P>
With 70 percent of the vote counted, the 72-year-old Dole won
support from almost one-third of some 130,000 Iowan Republicans.
</P>
<P>
Dole was overjoyed with the results. "I'm deeply gratified with
the strong support of Iowa voters," he said.
</P>
<P>
But the early results suggested a disappointing night for the
U.S. multimillionaire publisher, Steve Forbes, who shattered
records by spending more than 4 million U.S. dollars on television
advertising in Iowa. He was supported by only 10 percent of the
voters in the state.
</P>
<P>
U.S. television reports projected that conservative commentator
Pat Buchanan would finish second and former Tennessee Governor
Lamar Alexander would take the third place.
</P>
<P>
The vote was a culmination of months of campaigning,
fundraising and preparation by the nine GOP candidates in the
field as well as a test of survival for the contenders.
</P>
<P>
The winner, the second and possibly the third place finishers
in the Iowa caucuses will receive a boost going into the next big
test, the New Hampshire primary scheduled on February 20.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The fifth session of the first
executive council of the Association of Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS) was held here today.
</P>
<P>
Wang Daohan, president of ARATS, told the meeting that ARATS
has made great efforts at improving relations across the Taiwan
Straits under the "One China" principle since its establishment
four years ago.
</P>
<P>
After the first round of meetings, he said, ARATS made a lot of
preparation for the second round, but it had to be postponed
because some leaders of the Taiwan authorities, together with
foreign anti-China force, undermined the negotiation process by
creating "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan".
</P>
<P>
He said that ARATS has repeatedly stated its position on
negotiations and relations across the straits after negotiations
broke down, and pointed out that, although Taiwan's authorities
have talked about a resumption, they are trying to create "two
Chinas".
</P>
<P>
He urged the Taiwan authorities to return to the "one China"
principle and stop their divisive activities worldwide, adding
that only in this way can talks be resumed.
</P>
<P>
This year, ARATS will continue to implement the spirit of
President Jiang Zemin's speech on the Taiwan question and strive
for the reunification of the motherland, Wang said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier on Chinese-German Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji,
who concluded his week-long visit to Germany on Monday, said that
both China and Germany hope to forge a long-term, stable and
cooperative relationship between them.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the luncheon hosted in Frankfurt by the Asian and
Pacific Committee of the German Economy, Zhu said that China's
economic development and successful reforms have provided
favorable conditions for expanding economic and trade cooperation
between China and Germany.
</P>
<P>
The visits to Germany by President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li
Peng in recent years and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's visit to
China last year had given a great impetus to the development of
the bilateral relationship, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He said that his visit was also aimed at enhancing the
friendly relations and cooperation in the political, economic and
trade fields.
</P>
<P>
Germany is China's biggest trade partner in Europe. Trade
between the two countries reached 13.7 billion U.S. dollars in
1995, accounting for one-third of China's total trade with the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
Zhu emphasized that during the visit, he had reached consensus
with German leaders on a wide range of issues.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that China and Germany are both countries of great
international influence and have no conflict of interests between
them, according to Zhu.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the two countries should view their ties from a
long-term perspective and establish a long-term, stable and
cooperative relationship, the Chinese vice-premier said.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Zhu and his hosts agreed that further
concrete measures would be taken in vocational training, high
technology, infrastructure and cooperation between small and
medium-sized enterprises of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that he was deeply impressed by the strong wish of the
German government and various circles to develop cooperation with
China and moved by the friendship shown by the German people
towards the Chinese people during the visit.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, who visited the state of Bavaria on Saturday and Monday,
left Frankfurt for China Monday night.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Denies Expulsion of Diplomat by Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan today firmly denied
the reports that a Pakistani diplomat in its High Commission in
London had been expelled and described them as "misleading".
</P>
<P>
"No Pakistani diplomat had been expelled or deported," said a
Foreign Office spokesman here today.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that a Pakistani employee working in the
Pakistani High Commission in London was expelled Monday by Britain
for the "reasons of national security."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said that even as a non-diplomatic person
deported, Muhammad Saleem, had not been posted from Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said, Saleem had been living in the United
Kingdom for about 12 years and was a local employee in the High
Commission.
</P>
<P>
"Such employees did routine work and had very limited
responsibility," he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also said that the government of Pakistan was not
aware of the specific charges against Muhammad Saleem.
</P>
<P>
It can be categorically stated that Saleem had only been
assigned duties of a clerical nature by the High Commission, said
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
As for some reports attributing this to Pakistan's nuclear
program, he said that he would reiterate that Pakistan's nuclear
program was entirely peaceful and posed no threat to anybody.

<HEADLINE> Senior Armed Police Officers Removed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- A number of senior armed
police officers have been stripped of their positions by Chinese
central authorities because of dereliction of duty in relation to
the death of Li Peiyao.
</P>
<P>
A 19-year-old armed policeman, Zhang Jinlong, was arrested by
Beijing's Public Securities Bureau 11 days ago, and has been
accused of murdering Li, 63, who was vice-chairman of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) and chairman of
the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the
Chinese Kuomintang.
</P>
<P>
The officers dismissed are Meng Zhende, deputy chief of staff
of the People's Armed Police Force (PAPF) and commander of the
First Corps of the Beijing Armed Police Force, Zhang Shi'ai,
political commissar of the First Corps, and several lower-ranking
officers.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Shuguang, director of the Security Bureau of the General
Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, has
been appointed by the State Council and the Central Military
Commission to succeed Meng.
</P>
<P>
Yu Linxiang, deputy director of the Political Department of
PAPF, has been appointed to succeed Zhang Shi'ai.
</P>
<P>
Li's relatives expressed their satisfaction with the handling
of the case by the central authorities, and said that despite the
tragedy, they and their descendants still follow the Communist
Party of China.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, who was one of Li's bodyguards, has admitted to the
killing, saying that around four o'clock in the morning while on
duty, he decided to burglarize Li's house, but was caught in the
act.
</P>
<P>
When he attempted to flee the scene of the crime with things
he had taken from Li's house, he was stopped by two other guards
on duty.
</P>
<P>
Zhang came from north China's Shanxi Province and joined the
armed police in December of 1994.
</P>
<P>
The case is still under investigation.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Calls for Reconciliation in the Aegean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Deniz
Baykal said today that the crisis with Greece over an Aegean
islet was over and that "a new period of reconciliation" should
start in the region.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks following a meeting with visiting
Turkmenistan President Turkmenbasi Niyazov.
</P>
<P>
Baykal said that Turkish side was acting "with attention and
responsibility" for such a new period to come in the Aegean.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that after the Kardak Crisis is cooled down, there will
be a dialogue with good intention between the two countries," said
the Turkish minister.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey staged a military confrontation at the end of
last month over the disputed islet of Kardak, or Imia in the
Aegean Sea. A conflict was prevented after U.S. President Bill
Clinton mediated between the two NATO states.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to counter Greek efforts to bring the dispute to the
European Union, Baykal will start a diplomatic initiative in
European capitals on Wednesday to ask EU countries to remain
neutral concerning the issue.
</P>
<P>
Anatolia news agency reported that Baykal will leave Ankara
for London to meet his British counterpart Malcolm Rifkind. Then
he will fly to Brussels to hold talks with NATO Secretary-General
Javier Solana.

<HEADLINE> Quadrilateral Committee on Palestinian Refugees Opens Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The quadrilateral committee on
Palestinian refugees opened its meeting here today with the
participation of experts from Egypt, Jordan, the Palestinian
Authority and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting will discuss the return of Palestinians
displaced in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
The committee, set up in 1994, had held six sessions, but talks
have stalled so far over the definition and number of the refugees
eligible for repatriation to Palestinian self-rule areas in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli side holds that the refugees are those who were
forced to leave the West Bank and Gaza in 1967, putting their
number at around 200,000, while the Palestinians put the number at
1.5 million, saying that descendants should be counted.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side insists that the displaced Palestinians
should also include those from the West Bank, Gaza and Jerusalem
who were abroad when the fighting broke out in 1967.
</P>
<P>
Israel has proposed a gradual return of refugees according to a
timetable that would allow the repatriation of 4,000 refugees
annually. It said that the plan takes into consideration Israel's
security and the absorption capacity of the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said that the Palestinian side, aided by
Egypt and Jordan, is still trying to draw up a general framework
guaranteeing the return of all refugees without exception.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian negotiating team is led by Assistant Foreign
Minister for Arab Affairs Badr Hamam, while the Jordanian one is
headed by Jordan's Ambassador to Sudan Mohamed al-Shohankiri.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian and Israeli chief negotiators are Zohi al-Saidi
and Josef Hadas, respectively.

WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Kansas Governor Bill Graves
signed a legislation on Monday canceling the state's presidential
primary this year.
</P>
<P>
Graves called the primary an "unwarranted expense" for what's
expected to be a foregone conclusion, according to a UPI report.
</P>
<P>
"As I've stated before on several occasions, in this particular
election year, in this state, this election would have resulted in
an unwarranted expense of taxpayer money to simply ratify what's

</P>
<P>
State officials estimated the move will save the U.S. Midwest
state 1.4 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The legislation, approved last week, is a one-time cancellation
and provides for the return of the event in four years. It also
encourages the state party organizations to adopt rules to make
the primary results more meaningful by binding delegates to
particular candidates.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T, MCI Discuss Joint Efforts to Tap Local Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 12 (Xinhua) -- AT &AMP; T Corp. and MCI
Communication Corp., two telecommunication giants and longtime
rivals, are discussing joining their hands to build up local
telephone networks to compete against regional telephone
companies.
</P>
<P>
The negotiation has attracted wide-range attention because the
two companies, who have been competing for bigger shares of the
international market for years, will possibly lead to a
restructuring of the local telephone market.
</P>
<P>
It has been reported that AT &AMP; T and MCI have about 80
percent of the long-distance market but less than 1 percent of the
local market.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton's signing of the telecommunications bill last
week made it possible for the two companies and other
long-distance services to enter the local telephone business. The
local phone companies, dominated by the Baby Bells formed in 1984,
will also be trying to break into the long-distance business.
</P>
<P>
The talks between the two companies are also expected to end up
costing each company far less than having to build local networks
alone. Each would get a highly effective system of transmission
lines and switching centers from which to attack the Bells, which
still control more than 95 percent of the traffic in their local
markets, according to market analysts.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers reported today that AT &AMP; T and MCI have
found common ground in the past year, uniting to lobby for the
new telecommunications legislation and finding other ways to
work together.

<HEADLINE> Riley Promises Innocence on Drug Taking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Women's 100 meters
breaststroke world record holder Samantha Riley of Australia
promised her innocence on the positive drug test but she will have
to await the decision from world swimming ruling body FINA,
according to reports on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Riley, 23, tested positive for dextropropoxyphen at the world
short course championships in Rio de Janeiro of Brazil last
December, where she set the world short course records by winning
the 100 meters and 200 meters breaststroke titles.
</P>
<P>
Riley told a news conference in Brisbane that she was not a
drug cheat and that a two-year ban would probably end her career.
</P>
<P>
A positive test could lead to a ban of up to two years from
competition for the swimmer, which would kept Riley out of the
Atlanta Olympics in July.
</P>
<P>
Riley's lawyer, Peter Baston, said that he had put a two-hour
submission on behalf of Riley and her coach, Scott Volkers, to
FINA, in Berlin, last weekend.
</P>
<P>
Baston said on Tuesday that he expected FINA to hand down its
decision on the case "within 48 hours".
</P>
<P>
Volkers admitted a headache tablet he gave Riley had contained
the drug. He just intended to give her the commercially-available
pain reliever Panadol after Riley had complained of a headache
during the opening ceremony in Brazil, two days before her first
race.
</P>
<P>
She also set a world record in the 100 meters breaststroke and
won the 200 meters at the World Championships in Rome in 1994.

WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- World tennis super star
Andre Agassi of the United States breezed past collegian Ryan
Walters at the Sybase Open in San Jose, California, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, who was replaced by Thomas Muster of Austria as the
world number one, had an easy 6-2, 6-2 win over the 18-year-old
Walters, a Stanford freshman and top U.S. collegian player.
</P>
<P>
"I've never hit with anyone who hit that hard before,"
said Walters. "He proved to me that I'm not anywhere near that
level yet."
</P>
<P>
Agassi made it clear he doesn't think Muster is at the top
level, adding that it doesn't look good for tennis to have a world
number one who spent most of a year on clay and avoided surfaces
such as grass.
</P>
<P>
Agassi also blamed the ATP Tour's Best-14 ranking system for
Muster's rise to the top.
</P>
<P>
In other matches on Monday, Jan Kroslak of Slovakia upset
fourth seed MaliVai Washington of the United States 6-4,

MAPUTO, February 13 (Xinhua) -- A 125-kilometer transmission
line linking Mozambique with Zimbabwe is expected to be completed
by the end of 1977.
</P>
<P>
The installation of the line from Mozambique's Cahorabassa
Power Station to Zimbabwe is speeding up, with most raw materials
needed in the project having been transported to Beira Port, an
official of Linjebygg Company, which undertakes the project,
said.
</P>
<P>
Engineer of the company just named Magnes, told Mozambican
newsmen that installation of the transmission line has been slow
due to heavy rains at the construction sites in the past month.
</P>
<P>
But fine weather conditions in those areas at present would
enable the company to speed up the work so that the project could
be completed as scheduled, he said.
</P>
<P>
After the completion of the line, Mozambique would export to
Zimbabwe electricity of 500 megawatts each year.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The black Americans are
Iran's friends and allies in the struggle against the United
States and Israel, a visiting black American leader stated
here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing 2,000 students in Tehran University, Louis Farrakhan
said that "We are your friends and allies. What you may not
achieve from the outside, we may be able to achieve inside."
</P>
<P>
Farrakhan, leader of the Nation of Islam from the United
States, said that his purpose of coming to Iran is to learn from
the Islamic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
He said that it would be wonderful for Iranians to go
to the United States one day and see an "Islamic Republic of
the United States."
</P>
<P>
Farrakhan, who arrived here Saturday, took part in the
celebration of the 17th anniversary of Iran's Islamic Revolution
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Though you suffer from the wicked policy of the United
States," he said, "We the black have suffered from it over
440 years."
</P>
<P>
He said that Americans did not like him because he stated
the truth. "They are trying to make me stand on trial when
I go back to the United States," he added.
</P>
<P>
Farrakhan led the "Million Man March" in October 1995 in
Washington to protest against the government over the conditions
which beset black Americans.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration called by Farrakhan was the largest gathering
of black Americans in the United States since the historical
1963 march in Washington, where Martin Luther King spoke of
his dream of black equality in America.

<HEADLINE> Most Australian Voters Yet to Make up Minds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Most Australian voters are
yet to make up their minds on whom they will vote for with less
than 20 days to go before the March 2 federal election.
</P>
<P>
According to a public opinion poll conducted by the local paper
The Australian last weekend and published today, 41 percent of the
voters surveyed showed support for the ruling Labor Party while 50
percent for the opposition coalition of the Liberal and National
parties.
</P>
<P>
On the question of who would make the better leader, 42 percent
of the voters chose Prime Minister Paul Keating while 38 percent
preferred opposition leader John Howard.
</P>
<P>
Though the opposition maintained a strong lead over the Labor,
Labor leader Keating got ahead of Howard on the issue of personal
prestige.
</P>
<P>
The Australians seem to continue to see Keating as a better
leader than Howard, which might be what is making many voters
swing between the two choices.
</P>
<P>
An accountant working in a private company said that he
believed Howard would win narrowly, because the country's economy
had gone flat.
</P>
<P>
The stock market would certainly be going up if the Liberal
assumes office, but, cautious on making a choice, he said, adding
that he would like to see what Howard would do with the national
debt.
</P>
<P>
A student at the Curtin University shared the accountant's
view. "I am not too impressed with Howard, but I just think we
need a change. The Labor has been in power for as long as 13
years. We are overdue for a change," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that he "may vote Liberal if they could
demonstrate strong leadership and unity and can reassure the
public that policies will be carried through."
</P>
<P>
A junior officer of a government organization voiced support
for the ruling party. He said that he was sure the Labor would
win again by a narrow margin, because a strong leadership was
important for an active economy.
</P>
<P>
He said that Keating would hold the Labor together, so they
could get on with the business of governing.
</P>
<P>
As the federal election is getting nearer, the election
campaigns are turning white-hot. Voters are also seriously
considering who will bring more benefits to them in the next three
years.

<TEXT>
<P>
Statistics released by the Ministry of Public Security show
that in 1990 alone, there were 2,115 people injured by Spring
Festival firework celebrations in China's ten biggest cities
including Beijing and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Last year there were 331 explosions nationwide during the
production and selling of fireworks, resulting in 369 deaths, 753
personal injuries and almost 10 million yuan (1.15 million
U.S.dollars) in economic losses.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, people began to realize the potential danger
of fireworks and gradually there were calls for the banning of
fireworks in large and medium-sized cities.
</P>
<P>
In response to the demands the Ministry of Public Security put
forward a principle of management which stipulates that the
practice of setting off fireworks should be gradually limited with
a complete prohibition as the final objective.
</P>
<P>
Government at all levels have listed the banning of the setting
off of fireworks in their agendas. The campaign has been brought
into the legal track by means of local legislation.
</P>
<P>
Some large and medium-sized cities which have not yet forbidden
the setting off of fireworks are planning regulations in an
attempt to ban the activity completely in the near future.

<P>
BEIJING,February 13 (Xinhua) -- The practice of setting off
fireworks has been completely banned in 91 Chinese cities,
including Beijing and Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
The traditional way of warding off evil spirits has also been
partly banned in urban areas and in some built-up parts of cities
such as Shanghai, according to China's Ministry of Public Security.
</P>
<P>
During the Spring Festival last year, the number of fires
caused by fireworks nationwide fell by a quarter compared with the
corresponding period the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The fall was especially noticed in cities where setting off
fireworks is completely forbidden. Now festivals have become safer
and happier because of the fewer number of firework-related fires
and physical injury accidents.
</P>
<P>
Chinese people not only regard the setting off fireworks, a
traditional folk habit, as a means of driving out evil spirits and
praying for happiness, but also as a kind of recreational activity
which helps make festivals happier.
</P>
<P>
But with the improvement of living standards in China, the
total volume of fireworks consumed has rocketed over recent years,
resulting in an increasing number of fires and casualties.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets Kazakhstan Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said today that it is China's unswerving policy to promote the
good-neighborly and friendly relations with Kazakhstan and other
surrounding countries.
</P>
<P>
The remark came at a meeting with visiting Foreign Minister
Kasymzhomart Tokayev of Kazakhstan in Beijing this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting Jiang told the minister that bilateral ties
have witnessed satisfactory developments since the two countries
forged diplomatic relations four years ago.
</P>
<P>
A Sino-Kazakhstan agreement on border issues has already taken
effect, indicating a major event in bilateral relations, Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
The president went on to say that bilateral economic and trade
ties also enjoy a good momentum and the two sides are positively
seeking new ways of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Citing that the three China tours made by Kazak President
Nazarbayev had enhanced the two countries' friendly ties, Jiang
voiced his belief that such ties hold great potential for future
broad prospects,
</P>
<P>
China appreciates the efforts made by President Nazarbayev to
maintain security in Asia and is willing to continue to exchange
opinions with Kazakhstan and other countries, exploring effective
ways of regional security cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Describing the China visit by President Nazarbayev last year as
"very successful", Tokayev said the joint communique signed by
Kazakhstan and China during the visit was of great significance in
the history of two countries' relations.
</P>
<P>
He noted that his country attached importance to China's
successful experience in its reform and opening up and held that
it was in line with the mutual benefits to boost bilateral
relations in which there are no obstacles.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister stressed that Kazakhstan would continue to
implement agreements reached by the two countries to fully tap the
potential in bilateral cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Zambia, S. Africa Locked In Trade Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has continued to
turn down Zambia's overtures for a bilateral trade agreement
prompting the Southern African Development Community (SADC) to
intervene, revealed the local weekly "Financial Mail" today.
</P>
<P>
Cairman of Zambia Association of Manufacturers (ZAM) Mark
Odonnell was quoted as saying that the trade battle between the
two countries has contunued as Pretoria has blatantly turned down
Zambian offers for a trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
While South Africa enjoys a 13-1 trade ratio over Zambia, it
has still been unwilling to open its borders to Zambian goods and
this has forced SADC to interven in sympathy with Zambia, he
added.
</P>
<P>
SADC has set March this year as the month in which Zambia and
South Africa should conclude the bilateral trade agreement. Under
the proposed agreement, goods produced in Zambia will enter South
Africa at concessional rates or free while those from South
Africa should enter Zambia at normal rates, according to the
weekly.
</P>
<P>
Once the trade agreement is signed, Zambia will be able to
export goods, mainly agricultural products, worth 150 million US
dollars annually to South Africa and its neighbouring countries.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Jordanians Place Trust in New Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Most Jordanians believe that
Abdul Karim Kabariti, who assumed his post on February 4, will be
a successful prime minister and that his government is able to
"shoulder its responsibilities of the next stage" in Jordan's
political life.
</P>
<P>
According to an opinion poll conducted on a national sample of
1,200 ordinary people by the Center for Strategic Studies of
Jordan University last week, 95.3 percent believed the new prime
minister will succeed in his job.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the survey were also conducted on 501 opinion
leaders, including senior officials, senators, deputies of the
Lower House, and governors as well as leaders of political
parties, unions, businessmen and journalists. Of these, 85.5
percent and 81.7 percent expressed their confidence in the new
prime minister and the new government respectively.
</P>
<P>
The national poll had a three percent margin of error, while
the opinion leaders poll five percent.
</P>
<P>
"This indicates that the people want change on the one
hand, and are willing to give the new government a chance
to deliver," said Mustafa Hamarneh, director of the center.
</P>
<P>
He added that those who thought the composition of the
government was only partially successful will reassess their
initial appraisal in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
"It all depends on the performance of the government in the
months ahead," Hamarneh said.
</P>
<P>
Where ordinary people and opinion leaders differed most was
in their listing of challenges the government is going to
face.
</P>
<P>
Common folks placed democracy and public freedoms third on
their list while opinion leaders placed them last.
</P>
<P>
However, on top of both lists, both categories of the sampled
people thought poverty, unemploment and economy should be
accorded high priority.
</P>
<P>
Also on both lists were administrative reform and fight
against corruption.
</P>
<P>
Opinion leaders also demanded improved ties with the Gulf
states, Iraq and Syria.

KUALA LUMPUR, February 13 (Xinhua) -- A total of 152 Vietnamese
boat people returned home today on board flight VN7511, Malaysian
police said here.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's police field force central brigade commander SAC II
Hanif Ahmad told the press that the group of boat people,
comprising 87 men, 44 women and 21 children, were taken from
Kuala Lumpur's Sungai Besi Camp to the international airport in
three buses.
</P>
<P>
They were escorted by some one hundred policemen, and
representatives of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
According to Hanif Ahmad, there were still 4,278 Vietnamese
boat people staying in Malaysia nationwide now, and among them
3,487 were housed at the Sungai Besi Camp.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a group of 204 Vietnamese people returned to their
home country on February 6.
</P>
<P>
Last month, some Vietnamese boat people living at the Sungai
Besi Camp clashed with Malaysian police when they threw stones at
some police officers, protesting against repatriation arranged by
Malaysian authorities, Vietnamese government and the UNHCR.
</P>
<P>
During that incident, 23 people, including seven Malaysian
policemen, were injured and one Vietnamese died.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said shortly after
the incident that Malaysia could not tolerate those who came to
Malaysia and then made problems.
</P>
<P>
It is also reported that Malaysia and Vietnam have agreed that
some of the boat people will be repatriated by ship.

<HEADLINE> Report: Cyprus Ranks 26th on Human Development Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus is placed around the
26th position worldwide as far as the level of human development
is concerned, according to a local human development report.
</P>
<P>
The 1995 Human Development Report, released Monday by a local
statistics and research department, examines the various issues
and factors which affect the human development fields such as
education, health, unemployment and environment for 1980-1993.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Cyprus compares favorably in the
area of income distribution in relation to other countries.
</P>
<P>
While on an international scale, the richest 20 percent
receive 60 times more income than the poorest 20 percent, in
Cyprus, the ratio is as low as 17 to 1, the report says.
</P>
<P>
It notes that poverty in Cyprus is relatively low with only
about 4 percent of households having income less than the poverty
line.
</P>
<P>
Also, literacy among the adult population in Cyprus increased
significantly from 82 percent in 1960 to 94 percent in 1993, the
report shows.
</P>
<P>
"For women, the increase was very impressive. In 1993, it
reached 90 percent compared to 73 percent in 1960. For men,
literacy increased from 91 percent in 1960 to 98 percent in 1993,"
it adds.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, women in Cyprus have longer life
expectancy than men. In 1993, female life expectancy was 79.1
years while for men it was only 74.6 years.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the report says, unemployment remained at low
levels in the country during 1980-1993. It reached its higher
level in 1986 with an unemployment rate of 3.7 percent and its
lowest level in 1992 with a rate of 1.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Generally, however, women face higher unemployment than
men. In 1993, for example, while the overall unemployment rate was
2.6 percent, the rate among the female labour force reached 4
percent," the report points out.

<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Lu Ping, director of the Hong
Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council of China, met
with Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama and his entourage here
today.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that the Chinese and Portuguese governments have had
good co-operation in the past nine years since the signing of the
Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration on Macao. He noted that the
Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group has also done a lot of work.
</P>
<P>
China hopes to continue the momentum in the good co-operation
during the coming three-year transition period leading up to
China's resumption of the exercise of its sovereignty over Macao,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"There still exist lots of issues to be solved during the three
years. But we believe that so long as both sides exert efforts in
the spirit of co-operation and consultation the issues will be
smoothly solved," Lu Ping said.
</P>
<P>
The smooth solution to the Macao issue accords with the
interests of the people of Macao as well as being in the
fundamental interests of the two countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
Gama said that the Portuguese government and Portuguese
president will adhere to the policy of all-round friendly
co-operation with China and of continuing to co-operate with China
on the Macao issue. The Portuguese government hopes to further
strengthen exchanges and dialog with China on the issue, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that the existing problems can be smoothly
settled through joint efforts.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting Lu and Gama also exchanged views on the
localization of public servants and laws, the official status of
the Chinese language and other issues relevant to Macao.

<HEADLINE> S.African National Party Drops Demand For Power Sharing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The National Party (NP)
of South Africa has dropped its insistence on future power
sharing as provided for in the interim constitution, thus opening
the door for a majority party to form government, a local daily
"The Star" reported today.
</P>
<P>
NP's chief negotiator, provincial affairs and constitutional
development minister Roelf Meyer, yesterday told the
constitutional assembly's streamlining negotiating committee
that, following inter-party bilaterals, no party was in favour of
the current government of national unity (GNU) continuing after
the 1999 general election.
</P>
<P>
The GNU arrangement, a cornerstone of the constitutional
compromise provided by the interim constitution, expires on April
30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
With the concurrence of the NP, the committee scrapped the
earlier NP option in the draft constitution for the current GNU
dispensation to be written into the final constitution, which to
be finalized by May 9 this year.
</P>
<P>
Meyer said the NP would drop the GNU option and, in its place,
would seek another system which allowed minority parties to have
a say in the government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, senior African National Congress (ANC) negotiator
Essop Pahad said the ANC was still awaiting an NP proposal on
what form of power sharing it would want included in the final
constitution.

<HEADLINE> China Hopes Sino-US Consultations on IPR Make Progress:FM Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Shen Guofang expressed hope today that consultations
between China and the United States on the protection of
intellectual property rights(IPR) would make progress.
</P>
<P>
The consultations which began this morning in Beijing were
conducted between Zhang Yuejiao, director-general of the Treaty
and Law Department of China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Co-operation, and Lee Sands, assistant of the US trade
representative.
</P>
<P>
The talks are part of annual consultations, agreed after China
and the US signed an agreement on IPR in March last year.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question concerning this issue at a news
conference today, the spokesman said that the Chinese government
has always attached importance to the protection of IPR, which is
a basic policy of the country.
</P>
<P>
"Ever since its reform and opening up, China has done a lot in
the protection of IPR through legislative, judicial and law
enforcement processes." he noted.
</P>
<P>
Shen pointed out that in the past year, China has carried out
over 4,200 law enforcement checks; closed some law violating
agencies and institutions; and handed over some cases to the
judicial department for action. Rampant abuses of IPR and piracy
in certain places have now been effectively controlled, he
continued.
</P>
<P>
"In the future, the Chinese government will continue to
strengthen law enforcement in this regard," Shen said, adding,
this was consistent with China's opening up and its economic
development.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that China paid high attention to its
co-operation with other countries in the protection of IPR.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Railways To Lay Off 1400 Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Uganda Railways Corporation
(URC) announced here today that the corporation will retrench
1,400 workers by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The retrenchments were part of a restructuring program started
in November 1992 with the assistance of the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The exercise, which was supposed to take off in 1989, was
delayed for three years until the National Resistance Council
(parliament) enacted the URC statute.
</P>
<P>
The statute was aimed at transforming the URC from a social
service parastatal to a full commercial parastatal.
</P>
<P>
This means that the URC had to operate commercially, shed off
loss-making services and restructure itself in order to generate
profits.
</P>
<P>
The URC has reduced its staff from 7,800 to 3,400 workers, but
it is targeting a figure of 2,000 by the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The URC has one of the highest asset maintenance standards
particularly wagons and locomotives in the whole of Africa.

<HEADLINE> Peres Congratulates Arafat on Assuming PNA Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Shimon Peres Monday night called PLO chairman Yasser Arafat to
congratulate him on his assuming the post of president of the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
According to Israel Radio today, Arafat thanked Peres for the
congratulation, saying that he would work with Peres to bring
about a comprehensive peace between the Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Arafat was sworn in as PNA president in Gaza, and
set the date for convening the newly elected 88-member
Palestinian Council after Ramadan (Moslems' fasting month) ends
next week.
</P>
<P>
About 100 dignitaries and senior security officers attended
the 10-minute ceremony in the council chamber, which is
located in the renovated former headquarters of the Israeli
army in Gaza City.
</P>
<P>
Arafat was greeted by a band playing "Biladi," the
Palestinian national anthem, at the compound of the chamber.
</P>
<P>
"Who would believe that the PLO, described as a terrorist
organization by Israel, is now an authority and will become
a state," said Mohammed Abu Sirdanah, head of the religious
courts in the Palestinian Justice Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Arafat swore on the Koran that he will be faithful to his
country and to keep the constitution and the interests of the
Palestinian people, the security of their land and to achieve
their hopes and aspiration. "God is my witness," he said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat did not give a speech, saying he had nothing to add to the
words of the Palestinian National Council's acting chairman Salim
Za'anoun.
</P>
<P>
Za'anoun said: "We are living this day for our Arab and
Islamic nation, the triumph of Salah Din. We are returning to
Palestine, and we are passing from the small Jihad to the big
Jihad."
</P>
<P>
Salah Din, a Kurd, defeated the crusaders, to whom Israel
has been frequently compared the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has frequently interpreted the "great Jihad" as a
conquest of oneself, as against the "small Jihad," which means
military conquest of non-believers.
</P>
<P>
Despite Arafat's mention of a constitution, the PNA has not
yet had one. A basic law, in its fourth draft, has yet to be
approved by Arafat, and it will limit the president to two
five-year terms.
</P>
<P>
One of Arafat's first tasks as president is to appoint a
cabinet and prime minister. As president, according to the draft
law, he has the power to preside over their meetings.
</P>
<P>
Notably absent from the proceedings was Haidar Abdel-Shafi,
former Palestinian chief negotiator and a critic of Arafat's
authoritarian style, who is likely to be nominated as
president of the legislative council.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Environment Minister Yossi Sarid sent a
congratulatory cable to Arafat, saying he would send another
telegram when he becomes president of a Palestinian State.

<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's tourism business has
become a pillar industry in the capital, with its annual income
hitting more than 40 billion yuan (about 4.819 billion US dollars)
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The figure accounts for over 40 percent of the total revenue of
the capital's service industries, the "People's Daily" reported
today.
</P>
<P>
In the 1991-1995 period tourism brought in a total of 7.28
billion US dollars in foreign currency, and the total number of
overseas tourists amounted to 9.195 million, rises of 159 percent
and 87.1 percent, respectively, over the 1986-1990 period.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 the city's overseas tourism revenue climbed to more
than two billion US dollars, keeping abreast of its foreign trade
income, and the total number of domestic tourists rose from 1994's
67.1 million to 73.2 million, which made the city's domestic
tourism income exceed that from overseas tourism.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has 247 hotels for overseas tourists, a rise of 34
percent over that in 1990. As the largest tourism city in China,
it has 15 five-star, 24 four-star and 37 three-star hotels.

<HEADLINE> Iran Boasts of 140 Billion Barrels Oil Reserve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced here today that
the country's total oil reserves stand at 140 billion barrels, a
48 billion barrels increase as compared with last year's official
figure.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily Iran quoted an official of the National
Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) as saying that the total oil reserves
which could now be exploited is 93 billion barrels.
</P>
<P>
As for gas reserves, Iran ranked second after Russia with a
total gas reserve of 21 trillion cubic meters, said Mehdi
Hosseini, Director of the NIOC's Exploration.
</P>
<P>
Hosseini added that the Iranian gas reserves were a lot more
than estimated.
</P>
<P>
"In such areas as the southwestern and northeastern parts of
the country, Dasht-e Moghan, and most probably in the Caspian Sea
there are potential gas reserves. Consequently, the natural gas
reserves of the country could be a lot greater than what has
already been assessed," he added.
</P>
<P>
Hosseini criticized the rampant energy consumption in the
country, saying that if Iranians save 20 percent of the energy
each year, Iran could "build two refineries with a capacity of
150,000 barrels, four petrochemical factories with a production
capacity of 500,000 tons and thousands of schools and hospitals."
</P>
<P>
Many Iranian officials and energy experts have called on the
nation to conserve energy. Some have even called for an increase
in oil prices to encourage people to adopt energy-saving
measures.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Seal of Approval for Improved Postal Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) --Beijing is planning a
world-advanced postal system to cope with a growing mountain of
mail.
</P>
<P>
It will mean the city seeing a four-fold increase in its
current postal volume by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Details of the two-phase program were announced by Hu
Zhongyuan, deputy director of the Municipal Administrative Bureau
of Postal Services.
</P>
<P>
He said the development will be divided into two phases. The
first: to enlarge the postal handling area to cover 200,000 sq
meters; to build or rebuild 164 post offices - bringing the number
of post offices in Beijing to 620; to add another 80 postal routes
and increase the fleet of postal cars by 300. The aim will be to
double the postal volume and capability in 2000 over 1995.
</P>
<P>
In the second phase new areas for handling post will be built
and another 195 post offices constructed. The city's postal
network will be ranked among the most advanced in the world by
2010.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of 1995, the business volume of
the postal service reached 680 million yuan (about 82 million US
dollars); the city had also built or rebuilt more than 150 post
offices; introduced 94 new postal routes; and launched dozens of
new services. The second phase will mean a doubling of capacity
between 2000 and 2010. Added together the improvements in both
phases will quadruple Beijing's postal handling facilities.

<P>
HARBIN, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Heilongjiang
Province is striving to catch up with other provinces economically.
</P>
<P>
The province's gross domestic product (GDP) last year increased
by 9.5 percent, setting a record since 1985. Its industry grew by
16.2 percent last year, also a record.
</P>
<P>
Heilongjiang ranks among the leading areas in the country in
the production of oil, timber, coal, gold and grain, and its
mining, power plant equipment, metallurgical equipment, heavy
machinery, and paper making occupy strategic positions in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Hampered by the centrally planned economy, Heilongjiang used to
lag behind in economic development. Its annual industrial growth
was 7.8 percentage points lower than the nation's average during
the 1980-1993 period.
</P>
<P>
To change this situation, the province has since organized 245
corporations and enterprise groups while enlivening almost all its
small enterprises.
</P>
<P>
It also has increased its input into agriculture and mobilized
farmers' enthusiasm for farm production.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, the province is able to produce 25
billion kg of grain a year, higher than the country's average.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong Province in south
China has achieved remarkable results in restricting use by
non-farm sectors, which fell by one fourth in 1995 as compared
with the previous year.
</P>
<P>
According to the provincial land administration department, the
land areas for non-farm use totalled 16,400 ha in 1995, of which,
some 7,900 ha was arable land, accounting for only 50 and 60
percent, respectively, of the yearly quota for land use in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The provincial source said that to strictly curb land use by
non-farm sectors, Guangdong worked out a general plan in 1993,
confining the annual land use by non-farm sectors within 33,300
ha, including 16,600 ha of arable land.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the land areas allowed for real estate and
development zones should be kept within 25 percent of the annual
land use.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, land-use for luxury villas and buildings has been
put under even stricter control, allowing only 20 percent of the
available land for the real estate sector.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the provincial land administration department
said that the province encourages land use for developing
infrastructure facilities such as transportation, energy
resources, water-control projects and municipal works.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 the land areas allotted for infrastructure facilities
in the province accounted for 32 percent of the total available.

<HEADLINE> Some 60,000 Lebanese Teachers Go on Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 13 (Xinhua) -- More than 500,000 Lebanese
students have to stay at home today because of a warning
strike staged by 60,000 school teachers in a protest against
the the government over a procrastination in meeting
their demands for a salary rise.
</P>
<P>
Supported by the country's powerful Confederation of Workers
Unions (CWU), the teachers of public and private schools threatened
other strikes in this month if the government fails to offer them
a satisfied salary increase.
</P>
<P>
The CWU, which groups workers unions with an estimated
membership of about 400,000, has scheduled a nation-wide strike
and demonstrations on February 29 to press its demands for higher
wages against the government's economic and social policies.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the teachers' strike, the multi-billionaire
Prime Minister, Rafik Al Hariri, stressed a government ban on
demonstrations, saying that "the national security is guarded
and no one is allowed to play with it."
</P>
<P>
He told visitors to his office Monday that the
strike is a "way for the expression guaranteed by the
constitution."
</P>
<P>
"We are open for discussing demands of university and school
teachers and also workers, and the things have not reached a
dead-end street," he said.
</P>
<P>
One of the last attempts to prevent today's strike came in a
meeting Monday convened by Hariri with Minister of Education
Robert Ghanem and Chairwoman of the Parliamentary Education
Committee Hahiyat Al-Hariri.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the meeting, the education minister announced
that the prime minister promised to present a new scheme of salary
and wages set for every sector to the parliament for approval
before the Aid (The Moslem festival for the ending of the fasting
month Ramadan).
</P>
<P>
On the increase rate demanded by the teachers, Ghanem pointed
out that it has been "seriously discussed in our meetings and in
our dialogues." He underlined that a feasible solution acceptable
for the teachers, could be reached.
</P>
<P>
But the teachers responded by upholding the warning strikes
and threatening to stage other demonstrations on February 28 and
29.
</P>
<P>
The teachers in both public and private schools will hold
joint meetings in every area this afternoon to "assess the
strike day and to plan the future activities."

<HEADLINE> Israel Imposes Closure On Gaza Strip, West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Israel imposed closure on
the Gaza Strip and West Bank late Monday night to prevent possible
acts of vengeance for the killing of Yihye Ayyash, a Hamas
activist, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The army decision to seal off the Palestinian territories was
made in line with intelligence information that Hamas is planning
a strike against an educational institution or public
transportation in Israel.
</P>
<P>
At a rally marking the 40-day mourning period for Ayyash in
Nablus last Saturday, Hamas leaders called for violent attacks
against Israelis to avenge him.
</P>
<P>
Ayyash was killed in an explosion widely attributed to Israeli
secret agents. Senior security officials have called on the
public to be especially wary and to inform the authorities of
anything suspicious.
</P>
<P>
The closure is to continue until further notice. But it is
generally expected to be lifted at the end of the Islamic holy
month of Ramadan on February 20.
</P>
<P>
Under the order, all entry of Palestinians to Israel is
banned, except for certain humanitarian cases, Palestinian VIPs,
and departures abroad. Similarly, Israelis are barred from
entering the autonomous areas. Cargoes may be transferred from
Palestinian trucks to Israeli trucks at the Carni checkpoint in
the Gaza Strip.

<HEADLINE> More Shipping Licenses to Be Revoked in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Transportation
Department has threatened to revoke 240 shipping business licenses
and 107 non-shipping operational licenses from March this year if
respective firms fail to comply with the regulations.
</P>
<P>
The 347 business and operational licenses have already been
"frozen" for three months because the holders were non-active or
changed their address without contacting the department, Sea
Traffic Director A.S. Soepangkat was quoted by Bisnis Indonesia as
saying here today.
</P>
<P>
According to Soepangkat, ocean liner companies were obliged to
submit a report on shipping route patterns every three months and
also to report their ships' seaworthiness.
</P>
<P>
However, in practice, many shipping companies fail to comply
with these regulations. Even if they do, they don't do it
properly so the reports are categorized invalid.
</P>
<P>
These companies failed to meet deadline set by the department,
so the department has to revoke their licenses as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Since December 1995, the Transportation Department has revoked
90 shipping business licenses out of the total 1,286 shipping
firms operating in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Data show there are currently 473 non-shipping firms operating
in Indonesia's 22 provinces, of which some 130 firms have lost
their licenses.
</P>
<P>
A shipping firm is a company that owns at least one ship
serving the domestic or overseas route.
</P>
<P>
A non-shipping company is a firm operating ships used for
fishery, industry, oil and mining activities.

<HEADLINE> Jakarta Urged to Deregulate Shipping Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Association of
National Shipping Companies has urged the government to follow up
its recent reform measures with further steps if it wants to
prevent national shipping companies from going out of business.
</P>
<P>
The Association's Chairman Barens Saragih warned that without
further deregulations, national shipping firms would remain on the
brink of bankruptcy, according to a report by the Jakarta Post
here today.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the government imposed a ban on imports of used
fishing vessels. As a result, foreign fishing fleets dominated
fishing activities in Indonesia's territorial waters and exclusive
economic zone.
</P>
<P>
National freight companies faced a similar condition. Many
freight companies cannot survive the high maintenance and
operating costs and others cannot afford to buy new ships.
</P>
<P>
A 1985 presidential decree further pushed national shipping
firms into the corner. The decree opened up national ports to
foreign shipping lines and allowed national trading companies to
charter foreign lines to do their business.
</P>
<P>
The government last month announced its most recent reform
measures which, among others, cut back restrictions, tariffs and
levies on imports for export-oriented businesses. It also
eliminates the value-added tax on imports of fishing, freight and
passenger vessels.
</P>
<P>
The association chairman acknowledged the government's new
deregulation measures could at least encourage shipping companies
to add to the number of their fleets.
</P>
<P>
To follow up the recent deregulations, Saragih suggested that
the government provide incentives, such as tax deductions, to
encourage the use of domestic fleets.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Continue Resettlement Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Minister of
Transmigration Siswono Yudohusodo has reiterated the government's
commitment to continue the resettlement program to balance out
population distribution nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The minister's statement at a recent hearing with the House of
Representatives denied that transmigrants are increasingly
reluctant to be resettled to the less developed areas of eastern
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister acknowledged that the government has
fallen short of its target to resettle 70,400 families in the
fiscal year 1995-1996.
</P>
<P>
Certain data indicate that more and more transmigrants want to
return to their places of origin as development in Java
accelerates while living in resettlement areas meets some
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The government has been urged to improve the living conditions
in the resettlement areas so that more people will be encouraged
to move.
</P>
<P>
In addition, if the government wants to encourage more people
to resettle to other places outside Java, then the government
should ask transmigrants who have been successful to persuade
their fellow villagers in Java to move.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia launched its transmigration program in 1971. Since
then it has resettled more than 14 million people from the densely
populated islands of Java, Madura and Bali to more sparsely
populated islands around the country.

DHASKA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- One person was killed and over
85 people were injured Monday in incidents of anti-election
violence in various parts of Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
According to sources concerned, the dead was killed by a bomb
at a western district of Jhenidah while the others were injured in
clashes in districts of Sherpur, Comilla, Barisal, Sirajganj,
Gaibandha, Kishoreganj and Narayangan.
</P>
<P>
In the largest port city of Chittagong, bombs were tossed at
polls training offices. The day's worst violence was in K.C. Dey
Road and its surrounding areas where at least 15 persons including
two policemen sustained injuries.
</P>
<P>
In the capital Dhaka, several cocktails were hurled near the
offices of the Bangladesh Television and Radio Bangladesh
immediately after Prime Minister Khaleda Zia's election
projection speech over the state-run broadcasting media Monday
evening. Besides, at least five vehicles were set on fire while
around a dozen others were damaged as the anti-polls activists
went on rampage in different parts of the city till late last
night.
</P>
<P>
In recent days, violent incidents have frequently occurred due
to the mainstream opposition parties' resistance against the
ruling party-held coming "farcical elections". The opposition
parties have demanded for a neutral caretaker government to
supervise the polls and boycotted the polls process due to the
government side's refusal to accept the opposition demand.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong to Improve Efficiency in Businesses Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 13 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province will make a greater effort to improve efficiency in its
overseas businesses, according to the provincial Foreign Economic
and Trade Co-operation Committee.
</P>
<P>
The province has 744 businesses overseas, with 403 in Hong
Kong, 76 in Macao, and 265 in other parts of the world, according
to an official in charge of the committee.
</P>
<P>
They deal with everything from imports and exports, finance,
securities, property, and transportation to labor, consulting
services, and tourism and had profit of more than three billion
Hong Kong dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
But, compared with 59,000 foreign-funded joint ventures in
Guangdong, the overseas companies are few in number, and few of
them have large-scale production capacity. In fact, 19 percent of
them are in the red, and many others are idle.
</P>
<P>
To solve these problems, the province plans to develop
businesses in Japan and to set up large enterprises in North
America, Europe, and the Atlantic Region, the official said.
</P>
<P>
It will also support large companies like Foshan Development,
the Fumin Group, and Qijiang Development and encourage the
province's 73 enterprises that rank among the country's 500 top to
set up businesses or branches overseas.
</P>
<P>
For those that are losing money, the province will merge or
close down some and do its best to help bail the others
out.

today quoting Dr. Edy Lamanepa, head of the health office in
Kupang, East Nusa Tenggara.
</P>
<P>
Lamanepa said the high rate of fatalities was because many of
the villagers resorted to traditional medicines. In addition, he
said, a number of water springs have been contaminated during the
current rainy season.
</P>
<P>
Many people in remote areas could not obtain medical treatment
immediately due to transportation difficulties.
</P>
<P>
There is only one doctor on Sabu Island who must divide his
time between three village health centers and 18 smaller clinics.
</P>
<P>
According to Lamanepa, the city of Kupang has also been hit by
a dengue outbreak recently. Three people died while 218 others
had to be hospitalized.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Adopt National Drug Control Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Nepal has formulated a
national policy of drug control to be implemented during the
country's ninth Five-Year Plan period beginning 1997.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Home Ministry said Monday that they had
prepared the drug policy on the basis of recommendations from a
workshop on drug control held last year.
</P>
<P>
The policy will cover various aspects including law
enforcement, demand reduction, treatment and rehabilitation,
preventive programs, training and human development, partnership
with non-governmental organizations and research on drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
The government is working to control the drug abuse problem in
cooperation with the United Nations Drug Control Program (UNDCP),
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali authorities arrested 810 people on drug abuse
charges last year, among them 126 were foreigners, official
figures show.
</P>
<P>
According to Home Ministry officials, there are three forms of
drug crime in Nepal -- trafficking, addiction and production.
While production is confined to less dangerous cannabis and
hashish, the stronger varieties of heroin and opium were found
involved in trafficking and addiction.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government began last year to implement a program
for drug control in cooperation with the UNDCP, involving police,
custom officers and social workers.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Rationalizing Economic Structure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 13 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province achieved a sustained and rapid economic development
during the Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-1995).
</P>
<P>
In 1995 the gross domestic product (GDP) of Guangdong reached
544 billion yuan (about 65.5 billion U.S. dollars), 1.4 times the
1990 figure, increasing by an average rate of 19 percent a year, a
provincial government official said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, per capita GDP averaged 8,020 yuan (966.3 US
dollars), 1.2 times 1990's figure. At the same time, the annual
net income of rural residents rose to 2,699 yuan while that of
urbanites amounts to 6,849 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to rationalization of the economic structure, the
proportions of Guangdong's agriculture, industry and service
trades are getting more rational.
</P>
<P>
The province harvested 18 million tons of grain crops last
year, 1.4 million tons more than the previous year's figure. The
industrial output value registered a sustained high growth rate
over the past five years, with the figure reaching 933 billion
yuan in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Service industries also made remarkable progress. The
provincial retail sales totalled 230 billion yuan-worth last
year. The import and export value exceeded 100 billion US dollars
for the first time in history.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the investment pattern was readjusted and the
investment scale was well controlled. More funds flowed into basic
industries and infrastructure during the 1991-1995 period.
</P>
<P>
In the same period the province built 220 large or medium-sized
key projects, increased the length of highway and railway lines
and helped more households get access to telephone.
</P>
<P>
The number of poverty-stricken people in Guangdong has declined
from four million in 1990 to 800,000 in l995.

ISLAMABAD, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban nabbed
166 rival fighters who were preparing for an attack in western
Afghanistan Monday, said reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Taliban sources in Herat, the biggest city in
western Afghanistan, as saying that the captured fighters belonged
to former Herat Governor Ismail Khan who was defeated by Taliban
last September and escaped to Iran for asylum.
</P>
<P>
Ismail Khan was an ally of Afghan current President Burhanuddin
Rabbani and had good ties with Iran which borders Herat province.
</P>
<P>
Taliban sources said about 100 armed men were nabbed from a
village near the border town of Islam Qilla, 55 from Sindand
airbase area and 11 from Herat city.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that all the nabbed were Afghans who
infiltrated into Taliban-held Herat and Farah provinces from
Mashhad, an Iranian border town which was used by Ismail Khan as a
base.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Taliban sources said that Ismail Khan's men launched
an attack on Taliban forces in Nimroz province in southwestern
Afghanistan Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, the attack was repulsed when Taliban jet fighters
heavily bombed the rival troops, the sources said.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has
decided to revise the country's Cost of Living Index which is
based on 1952 prices and is considered outdated, according to
official sources here today.
</P>
<P>
The Cost of Living Index is used in Sri Lanka as an official
inflationary and wage adjustment indicator, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The revised index will be compiled taking into consideration
the changed living styles since 1952 and conditions and prices.
</P>
<P>
The new Cost of Living Index is expected to be brought into
effect at the end of this year or early next year.
</P>
<P>
The 1952 index reflects outdated consumption patterns and was
worked out on a basket of commodities and weightage appropriate
for that year.
</P>
<P>
The new index will be worked out according to the changed
consumer habits during the past 40 years and the current
availability of a wide range of goods and services for the "market
basket".

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Parties Begin Anti-poll Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The mainstream opposition
parties in Bangladesh began their countrywide day-long
rail-road-waterways barricade this morning as part of their
campaign to resist what they called "one party farcical" general
elections scheduled for February 15.
</P>
<P>
The program will be followed by a 48-hour nationwide general
strike on February 14-15.
</P>
<P>
Appealing to people to enforce the barricade "wholeheartedly,"
a press release from the opposition said last night that rickshaws
were exempted from the program.
</P>
<P>
Although the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the
government have got ready for the February 15 polls, all
opposition parties have boycotted the polls process to press their
demand for the resignation of the present government to pave the
way for a neutral caretaker government to supervise the national
elections.
</P>
<P>
To drum up support for the barricade, opposition activists last
night staged separate processions in different parts of the
capital city.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a rally of professionals and cultural activists
Monday afternoon, Sheikh Hasina, president of the largest
opposition party -- the Awami (People's) League, called for an
all-out resistance against what she called "farcical and
one-party" elections.
</P>
<P>
The people would not accept the "pre-decided results of the
blueprint farcical elections," she said, warning that those who
cooperate would do so at their own risk.

A senior military officer said that they were keen on finding

The attack happened in a place where earlier that day two

The military claimed that this was a mere coincidence and that
no longer did the army react in this manner as it would only help

HANGZHOU, February 13 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang
Province plans to import and export 12.7 billion US dollars-worth
of commodities in 1996, said Yang Zucheng, director of the

<P>
In the meantime, he said, the province will actually use 1.3
billion US dollars of foreign investment and push a number of
large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises onto the

<HEADLINE> Pudong Development Orderly Thanks to Regulations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Pudong New Area in
Shanghai, China's financial and economic center, is witnessing
orderly development thanks to the promulgation of 71 regulations
in the aspects of economy, commerce, science and education.
</P>
<P>
Instead of resorting to administrative meetings or leaders'
directions like they did before, people in Pudong seek help from
regulations now when they encounter new problems.
</P>
<P>
When no such regulations are available, the authorities invite
specialists and scholars concerned from both at home and abroad to
draw up relevant regulations as soon as possible, in a bid to
ensure that any new economic activity can be brought into the
orbit of legality soon after it emerges, which is quite different
from their habitual practice of drawing up laws only after enough
experience has been accumulated.
</P>
<P>
In recent years there have been hundreds of construction
companies involved in over 4,000 construction sites in this
economically booming area.
</P>
<P>
In view of this, the Management Committee of the Pudong New
Area has enacted a series of specific and concrete regulations,
including interim regulations for environmental management of
construction sites and regulations on punishment of construction
in violation of rules, in an attempt to ensure an effective
management of construction industry in Pudong.
</P>
<P>
Although some of these regulations are only interim ones and
awaiting perfection, both domestic and foreign investors have
expressed their appreciation because the timely and effective
legislation in the Pudong New Area has contributed quite a lot to
the rapid and orderly development of the area.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Farm Law Changes to Benefit Thai Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Amendments to U.S. farming
laws will help Thai farmers and agricultural exports, according to
a Thai official.
</P>
<P>
Over the next five years, if U.S. agricultural production falls
and prices increase, Thai farmers will have a strong opportunity
to increase penetration in world markets, according to Dr Supote
Dechates, deputy secretary-general of the Thai Office of
Agricultural Economics.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Senate last week approved a seven-year farm bill,
under which traditional crop subsidies which fluctuate according
to market prices will be replaced with fixed annual payments which
decline over the life of the bill.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which is expected to go to the U.S. House of
Representatives later this month, will shift funds previously used
for farm subsidies to wetland protection and land conservation
programs.
</P>
<P>
Reducing subsidies for rice planting, for instance, would cut
into the margins for U.S. farmers, who might instead turn to
planting other crops.
</P>
<P>
This will be good for Thai farmers, said Supote.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is the world's largest rice exporter, with exports
reaching almost six million tons in 1995. India and the U.S.
ranked second and third with exports of 4.1 million and 3 million
tons respectively.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Credit Rating to Remain Steady </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will again receive an
'A' credit rating this year, said a Thai fiscal policy official.
</P>
<P>
Thailand will resume a class 'A' credit rating due to its
robust economic growth, as the country does not have any
short-term economic difficulties, said Somchai Richupan, director
general of the Fiscal Policy Office.
</P>
<P>
Last year Thailand gained an A rating from standard and poor's.
The rating showed that Thailand was capable of repaying debts and
could sustain its economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's current account deficit -- about 7.1 percent of
gross domestic product (GDP) -- does not affect the economy, said
Somchai.
</P>
<P>
The soaring deficit was caused mainly by imports of capital
goods. The deficit would be written off by a higher production
capacity as a result of the application of those capital goods in
the long run, he said.
</P>
<P>
The rocketing deficit was also caused by the appreciation of
the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
Despite the current account deficit, Thailand is building up
the country's foreign reserves.
</P>
<P>
However, the current account deficit is a problem that must be
soon addressed, otherwise it could erode the country's financial
fundamentals, said Somchai.

billion NZ dollars (one NZ dollar equals 0.67 U.S. dollar) to over

</P>
<P>
The government said in its budget policy statement today that
the increase is based on its expectation of a record budget
surplus of over 3 billion dollars in 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
The statement estimates that the tax cuts to be announced next
week will cost more than 1 billion in 1996-97 and over 2 billion
dollars the year after. There could be a third round of tax cuts
in 1998-99 if the financial situation permits.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury is also forecasting that with the continuing
growth of the economy, the unemployment rate will drop by another
one percentage point and more to 5 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
It predicts that the economy will grow by 2 percent in this
financial year, 4 percent in 1996-97 and 4.3 percent in the
following year.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Bill Birch said the statement indicates that
the government's books are in much better shape than a few years
ago.
</P>

As New Zealand will hold its general election later this year,
the statement is seen as a strategy document of the government.

The government has spent large sums of money to produce
anti-rabies vaccines and set up immunization centers. But public

<HEADLINE> Mongolia Revives Traditional Script </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Public notices, signs and
publications as well as official and military documents will soon
be written in Khalkha Mongol script which may be new to young
Mongolians but is familiar to their parents and grandparents.
</P>
<P>
The Mongolian government has issued a decree making it
compulsory for government offices and state-run enterprises to use
Khalkha Mongol, a traditional script used by more than one million
people in the country prior to the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
The decree also requires central government and provincial
officials to promote the use of the traditional script, which was
replaced in 1941 by a modified Cyrillic writing based on the Roman
alphabet.
</P>
<P>
Demands have been on the rise since 1990 to revive the
traditional Mongolian script and in 1991, the State Great Hural
(parliament) approved a resolution to reinstate it as the official
script.
</P>
<P>
Mongolian lawmakers passed a national script scheme late last
year which mandates special committees to be set up before
Thursday to supervise the shift back to the old script and to
offer crash courses for government executives starting in April.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Security Forces Defuse Rebel Bombs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 13 (Xinhua)-- Sri Lanka's Security Forces
have defused a bomb in Colombo which Tamil rebels planned to use
to cause extensive damage equal to that by the January 31 bombing
attack on the country's Central Bank, official sources here said
today.
</P>
<P>
Following tip-offs from the public, the security forces were
able to identify and defuse a 150 kilogram device attached to a
vehicle parked near a temple in the heart of Colombo, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
They said that this second attempt would have been as
destructive as the earlier assault on the Central Bank had it gone
undetected.
</P>
<P>
A bomb blast caused by the rebel liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE) at the Central Bank killed about 80 people and
injured more than 1,200 others on January 31.
</P>
<P>
The security authorities were notified of the suspicious
vehicle and they took action to defuse the bomb on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier a similar vehicle was detected and seized by security
forces at Ratnapura, about 80 km north of Colombo, on its way to
the capital city.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting against the government for a
separate state in the north and east of the country since 1983.
More than 50,000 people have been killed in the country's ethnic
war.

<HEADLINE> Holbrooke Announces Guidance on Bosnian War Criminal Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian government has
agreed to new rules regarding the pursuit of suspected war
criminals in Bosnia, U.S. peace mediator Rickard Holbrooke said
today.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the Bosnian government will submit a list
of suspected war criminals to The Hague war crimes tribunal for
screening.
</P>
<P>
Only those individuals approved for detention by the tribunal
could then be apprehended by the government.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke said the agreement was reached after his talks with
Bosnian president Alija Izetbegovic for the second time in two
days, which followed his trip to Belgrade, capital of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The agreement preserves both freedom of movement and the
commitment to prosecute war crimes, two seemingly conflicting
provisions of the Dayton peace accord which was signed in Paris
last November, Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
The need for the new rules arose after the Bosnian government
detained at least 10 Bosnian Serbs in recent weeks on suspicion
of involvement in war crimes.
</P>
<P>
In response, the Serbs decided to suspend their contacts with
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a threat to the Dayton
peace process.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President
Ernesto Samper Pizano today reiterated his government's firm will
to continue to fight ruthlessly against drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
President Samper described the war in Colombia against drug
trafficking as successful.
</P>
<P>
He said that 2,964 anti-drug operations were carried out by the
police, the army, the navy and the unified commands at a cost of
more than 118 million dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
During those operations, 25,000 hectares of coca plants and
4,296 hectares of poppy fields were destroyed, 573 laboratories
dismantled and 80 aircraft and 87 boats used for transporting
drugs intercepted and huge quantities of chemical ingredients for
processing drugs seized.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,634 drug traffickers were arrested including Cali Cartel
kingpins.
</P>
<P>
On the current political crisis in the country, Samper said
that Colombia has lived through "turbulent and difficult times" in
the past few months as a result of the accusation that drug money
had been used in the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his determination to continue the fight. The
memory of the 584 members of security forces who sacrificed their
lives in that war in 1995 makes that an obligation, he said.

<HEADLINE> France, Germany to Adhere to Single Currency Plan: Juppe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 12 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Alain Juppe
said here today that France and Germany will insist on the
timetable for the launch of a single European currency and the
criteria for a European monetary union.
</P>
<P>
Juppe told reporters after talks with German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl that France will make every effort to get ready for the
planned launch of the single currency on January 1,
1999. Countries taking part must meet certain criteria with regard
to budget deficits and inflation rates.
</P>
<P>
Despite widespread speculation that there might be a delay in
the start of the single currency, Juppe rejected any change in the
plan, saying that would be the "road to failure."
</P>
<P>
When asked whether France was thinking of launching the single
currency with Germany only, Juppe said, "that's not part of the
Maastricht Treaty. We think other countries (in the European
Union) will be ready, including those that criticize (the single
currency) but are getting ready to take part if it works."
</P>
<P>
As to the economic situation in France and Germany, Juppe said
the two countries have "the same kind of problems," pointing to "a
slowdown in economic growth and increase in unemployment."
</P>
<P>
During their talks, Juppe and Kohl also coordinated their stands
toward Russia, since both are scheduled to visit Moscow, Juppe on
February 14-16 and Kohl immediately afterwards.

<HEADLINE> Heavyweight Boxer Suspended for AIDS Virus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- American heavyweight boxer
Tommy Morrison was suspended after being tested positive for the
virus that causes Aids, it was confirmed by Morrison's promoter on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Tony Holden said that Morrison learned of the positive test
results Friday night, one night before his scheduled bout against
Arthur Weathers in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
Nevada state suspended Morrison hours before the fight but
boxing officials gave no reason.
</P>
<P>
Morrison, who beat George Foreman in 1993 in his last fight in
Nevada, last fought October 7 when he was bloodied in getting
stopped in the seventh round by former WBC champion Lennox Lewis.
</P>
<P>
A British promoter for Lewis, Panos Eliades, said the former
WBC heavyweight champion was in Jamaica and hadn't heard about
Morrison's suspension.
</P>
<P>
Although state boxing officials declined to comment on
Morrison's case, the commission's chief physician, Dr. Flip
Homansky, said that if a boxer would test positive for HIV, the
test would be repeated. If it still comes up positive, a more
sophisticated test is administered. That analysis takes 24
hours.

<HEADLINE> French Prime Minister to Visit Moscow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 13 (Xinhua) -- To continue dialogue with
Russia is one of the priorities in France's foreign policies,
French Prime Minister Alain Juppe said during an interview with
Russia's Izvestia daily today.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, scheduled to arrive here Wednesday for a
three-day official visit, said the trust formed between French
President Jacques Chirac and his Russian counterpart, Boris
Yeltsin, permits the development of a "privileged partnership
based on strong and dynamic ties."
</P>
<P>
However, he expressed regret over the fact that economic ties
between the two countries have not yet reached the scale of
political relations.
</P>
<P>
"Russia is yet to achieve success on the path of reforming
its markets to make them more attractive," Juppe said.
</P>
<P>
During his visit in Moscow, the French prime minister is
expected to hold talks with his Russian counterpart, Viktor
Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
One of the major topics will be the creation of a
Russian-French Commission for Economic and Technological
Cooperation, as suggested by the two countries' presidents last
month.
</P>
<P>
Juppe expressed the hope that the so-called Juppe-Chernomyrdin
commission, which is to hold its first session during his trip,
will contribute to the development of economic cooperation between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Several intergovernmental agreements are also expected to be
signed duing Juppe's visit.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the relations between Russia and Europe, Juppe
noted, "The future Europe could not be built without Russia,"
whose "misgivings and interests" he said should be taken into
account.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that Russia, on its part, should not
regard the enlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) as a threat.
</P>
<P>
The NATO also intends to strengthen its ties with Russia, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Shanhaiguan Attracts More Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINHUANGDAO, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Shanhaiguan, a port city
in north China's Hebei Province, had attracted a total of 144
million US dollars in foreign investment by the end of 1995 in its
development zone alone.
</P>
<P>
The funds, which came from Thailand, Japan, Singapore, the
United States, France, Italy, Russia, Hong Kong and Taiwan, were
for the establishment of 40 foreign-funded enterprises. Besides,
416 co-operative enterprises have been set up jointly by local
companies together with ones from other parts of the province and
the country as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Located in the north shore of the Bohai Sea, the Shanhaiguan
Economic and Technological Development Zone has a designed area of
20 square kilometers. It sits at the juncture of north China with
northeast China.
</P>
<P>
In March 1992 the Chia Tai Group of Thailand invested 80
million US dollars in the establishment of a major cereals and
edible oil processing center. The products from the joint venture
are now selling well in north and northeast China, and the
enterprise produces more than 100 million yuan in profits and
taxes annually.
</P>
<P>
Attracted by the success, a number of other foreign companies
started to invest in the zone, specializing in foodstuff
processing, metal processing, machinery and electronics, packaging
materials, fine chemicals and real estate. In 1995 the zone
produced 185 million yuan in industrial output value and 37
million yuan in gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
To build a better investment environment, the development zone
has raised 300 million yuan for building a special railway line, a
highway, a waterworks, and a port with eight berths and a total
cargo-handling capacity of 10 million tons. Most of these projects
have been completed and the rest will be finished soon.

<HEADLINE> Chongqing Becomes Cleaner, Quieter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- This largest industrial
center in southwest China's Sichuan Province has become cleaner
and quieter following one year of efforts to improve the city's
environment.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Liu Zhizhong said that the city spent 300 million yuan
last year upgrading roads and building overpasses and underpasses,
120 bus stops and 180 telephone booths.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 the city government formulated 12 sets of sanitary
regulations of this city with a population of 15 million,
including four million urban residents.
</P>
<P>
The regulations ban such acts as the illegal encroachment of
sidewalks, setting up sales booths without approval, causing noise
pollution and putting up advertisements on walls and electricity
poles.
</P>
<P>
Last year nearly 2,000 houses built in violation of government
rules and over 50,000 unauthorized sales stands in the downtown
area were removed in accordance with the regulations, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Now anyone who puts up illegal advertisements will have their
posts and telecommunications service cut off and their names
published in the local newspapers. So far, more than 70
enterprises and individuals have been punished in this way.
</P>
<P>
To reduce the noise level, the city government bans
construction at night and horn blowing in urban areas. It has also
ordered all public entertainment facilities, such as dance halls,
karaoke halls and night clubs, to reduce their noise levels to a
minimum.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Chongqing City Environmental Protection
Bureau said that the city's average noise level now is three or
four decibels lower than before.
</P>
<P>
To date, half a million residents have taken part in various
kinds of voluntary labor to make Chongqing cleaner.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of the
Mexican Interior Ministry and the opposition Democratic
Revolutionary Party (PRD) resumed dialogue today to find a
solution to the blockade of oil wells in the state of Tabasco,
southeastern Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Jesus Ortega Martinez, coordinator of PRD deputies in the lower
house, is confident that progress will be made beginning today to
solve the conflict in which about 90 people were taken into
custody.
</P>
<P>
The legislator said his party will go to the meeting with an
open mind and prepared to reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
A group of PRD followers, headed by Andres Manuel Lopez
Obrador, the former PRD candidate for the state governor, blocked
several wells owned by PEMEX, Mexico's state-owned oil monopoly,
in that state.
</P>
<P>
The action was motivated, according to the protesters, by the
grave environmental impact caused by the extraction of crude oil
in the zone and also by the alleged misappropriation of the money
PEMEX has paid to the government of Tabasco in compensation.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican government declared the occupation illegal and
ordered the removal of the demonstrators by special police and
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Oil production has continued to drop because of the
occupation.

PANAMA CITY, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Panama and Costa Rica went
on their sixth round of bilateral trade negotiations today in this
capital aimed at reaching an agreement on Panama's entry to the
World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Panama's negotiating team is headed by its Trade Minister
Nitzia de Villarreal and Costa Rica's by its Foreign Trade
Minister Jose Maria Rossi.
</P>
<P>
The minister for Costa Rica told reporters that so far, the
negotiations have been carried out in a cordial, friendly and
respectful manner and both parties will continue to seek an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Panama's negotiating group has not been able to reach an
agreement on milk products, for milk known as UHT, in particular,
since Costa Rica is requesting the entry of 5 million liters a
year of its UHT milk production to the Panamanian market.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Panamanian products catalogue the request as
"exaggerated" in the belief that it could jeopardize national
production and state.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Gonzales Ramirez, a member of the negotiating team for
Panama's entry to the WTO, declared that his government will
present a new proposal to Costa Rica through which an
understanding may be reached.

MONTEVIDEO, February 12 (Xinhua) -- During the first 10 months
of 1995, trade between China and Uruguay reached a volume of 138.5
million dollars, thus making China Uruguay's third most important
trade partner followed by the United States and Germany.

during the first 10 months of 1995 by more than 20 percent
compared with the same period the year before, with China
importing 112.14 million dollars of goods from Uruguay and
exporting 26.4 million dollars of products, with an 85.7 million
dollar surplus in Uruguay's favor. This figure shows that
Uruguay's biggest trade surplus in the world is with China.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Conducting Big Scale Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, February 13 (Xinhua) -- "I am now as rich as a
white-collar employee in foreign-funded firms," said a farmer in
Jiangxiang village on the outskirts of this capital of east
China's Jiangxi Province, a major rice granary.
</P>
<P>
Liu Xianbiao, 30, and his wife earned 20,000 yuan by
contracting about five ha of rice fields in the village, which
yielded more than 50,000 kg rice last year.
</P>
<P>
Liu is not the only Chinese farmer who is cashing in on
larger-scale management of land to better off. While farmers in
booming coastal regions and suburbs of major cities flock to seek
fortune in non-agricultural sectors, more and more far-sighted
farmers are turning to farmland to make money.
</P>
<P>
Their solution is to contract large areas of farmland and
manage it in larger scale, or in other words, put it into mass
production. Liu's contracted fields are 80 times more than the
per-capita acreage of farmers in Jiangxi.
</P>
<P>
In Jiangxiang village, known as Jiangxi's No. One village in
terms of grain production, there are 400 households that have
contracted more than three ha of farmland for each.
</P>
<P>
In Nanchang County, in the suburbs of the provincial capital,
20 percent of its total farmland was contracted by only five
percent of the families.
</P>
<P>
According to an official of the provincial government in charge
of agriculture, farmers in Jiangxi's remote areas are also
adopting larger-scale management.
</P>
<P>
Experts described the phenomenon as a strong indication that
the scale management of land which is characterized by mechanized
farm work is becoming more and more popular.
</P>
<P>
"It is a must that the new kind of cultivation will hold water
in the coming years," the experts said, "It has taken shape on the
voluntary basis of farmers and it will become a driving force of
the local economy."
</P>
<P>
A representation of sort of trend in China's future
agricultural development, the larger-scale management also help
boost spread of agro-technology.
</P>
<P>
Besides scale-managing farmland, a lot more farmers are also
doing big in planting cash crops and some even contracted ponds to
raise fish.
</P>
<P>
Wu Anlu, who hired 40 workers at his pig-raising farm,
contracted five ha of water surfaces. He claimed to have earned
more money than Liu Xianbiao.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, farmers in Jiangxi netted a per capita income of 1,500
yuan, an increase of 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
China had increased its grain production by a big margin since
a household contract system was introduced in 1978, but the
system, based on individual households, has become a barrier to
mass farming production in the economically developed areas in
recent years. Modern agriculture demands scale economic efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The grain output in Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian,
Guangzhou, Guizhou, Hunan, Jiangxi, Hubei in the south of China
decreased by 850 million kg in 1994 as compared with 1990.
</P>
<P>
China plans to encourage the scale management method in the
coastal areas over the next few years in a move to realize the
goal of turning out 500 million tons of grain by the end of the
century.
</P>
<P>
Over the past several years, rational land contracting
mechanism in east China's Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Shanghai
and Jiangxi has been initially set up.

<HEADLINE> New Zealanders to Pay for Watching Live TV Rugby  Matches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- New Zealanders will have to
watch the rugby matches played by their favorite teams on
pay-television channels in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Under a three-year deal secured by the pay TV firm Sky Monday,
Sky won the rights to broadcast live all New Zealand rugby games
played in New Zealand, Australia and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The pay-to-watch decision was made despite the personal plea
from Prime Minister Jim Bolger, who asked the negotiating teams
late last week to try to keep the matches free to air.
</P>
<P>
Many matches will be shown on public television, but they will
be delayed coverage.
</P>
<P>
Rugby is the most popular sports activity in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
A TVNZ report said this morning that Bolger has ruled out the
possibility of government intervention in the deal.
</P>
<P>
But rugby fans across the country have been outraged by the
decision. They say some areas do not get good Sky reception and
delayed match coverage will not be the same.
</P>
<P>
If people try to watch a match delayed, a fan reasoned, there
will be always someone spoiling it by revealing the score.

welcome this afternoon to the speech made by British Prime
Minister John Major in the parliament, According to reports

UNITED NATIONS, February 12 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali will convene a meeting here between the United

</P>
<P>
The meeting will be part of an ongoing effort initiated by the
secretary-general to enhance the dialogue between the United
Nations and regional organizations, a U.N source said today.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. source said that it will provide an opportunity for an

Thirteen regional organizations, president of the General
Assembly Diogo Freitas do Amaral and president of the Security
Council for the month of February Madeleine Albright are expected
to attend the meeting slated for February 15 and 16.

in peacekeeping and other fields, convened on August 1, 1994.
</P>
<P>
At that meeting, the participants discussed three main topics --
areas of intervention, principles of action and modalities for

<HEADLINE> Most Japanese Companies Unhappy with Profits in UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Japanese companies are
generally disappointed with the profitability of their investments
in Britain, which now total more than 30 billion U.S. dollars,
according to a survey by the KPMG accountancy firm.
</P>
<P>
The firm said a survey of 70 top Japanese industrial companies
found that none thought their profits were high, 40 percent said
they were average and 53 percent said they faced low profits or
losses.
</P>
<P>
Profits failed to live up to expectations because European
economies went into reverse instead of booming as the single
market came into force in 1992, the survey showed.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the value of the yen soared, putting pressure on
the cost of imported components, and heavy competition dented
margins, especially in areas such as consumer electronics in which
Japanese companies specialize.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 70 percent of the companies polled said they were
looking at ways to improve their overall competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
This would require better use of accounting procedures to
pinpoint profitable activities, and more focused marketing
efforts, with greater emphasis on after-sales service to enable
products to command premium prices.

<HEADLINE> Eurotunnel to Upgrade Passenger Facilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Eurotunnel, the Anglo-French
Channel tunnel operator, plans to spend 400 million pounds (612
million U.S. dollars) over the next four years improving passenger
facilities in spite of its 8 billion pound (12 billion dollar)
debt.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times reported today that despite its debt,
Eurotunnel hopes to modernize terminals and expand its fleet of
shuttle trains to achieve an urgently needed increase in passenger
numbers.
</P>
<P>
Eurotunnel expects to win the approval of its banks for the
project. But they would require annual approval by the company's
instructing banks, the 19 banks with which it maintains regular
contact.
</P>
<P>
Main items of expenditure would be 16 additional shuttle
wagons, expected to be delivered this year, and two new shuttle
trains, to go into service at the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Other improvements Eurotunnel plans include more retail space
and better facilities for business travelers at its Folkestone and
Calais terminals.

<HEADLINE> Major Pledges to Go on Working for Peace in Ulster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John
Major said today that he world go on working until peace has been
brought to the conflict-torn Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
the prime minister made a television address to the nation,
expounding his strategy for Northern Ireland following the
powerful bomb blast plotted by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) in
east London last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Major declared that peace for Northern Ireland "does not have
to be a dream" and people of Northern Ireland want peace.
</P>
<P>
He warned the IRA and its political wing Sinn Fein that they
could expect no sympathy and no quarter if they reject democratic
principles and use violence.
</P>
<P>
He said that the IRA's bombing last Friday did not mean that
"three years of unprecedented effort Northern Ireland had been for
nothing.
</P>
<P>
Major reminded the country that there might be more bombs in
the future. But he vowed to hunt down the "criminals who murdered
innocent people last Friday".
</P>
<P>
"The IRA will never bomb their way to the negotiating table,"
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
However, "Sinn Fein and the IRA have a choice. Only when they
commit themselves unequivocally to peace, and reinstate the
ceasefire, can they have a voice and stake in Northern Ireland's
future," he added.
</P>
<P>
Major once again explained his plans for elections in Northern
Ireland, saying that his government would intensified its work
with the democratic parties and the Irish government to preserve
the new "spirit for peace" in Ulster.

<P>
WASHINGTON February 12 (Xinhua) -- Interest rates on short-term
U.S. Treasury securities fell in today's auction to the lowest
levels in more than a year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Treasury Department sold $13.8 billion in three-month

percent last week. Another $13.8 billion was sold in six-month

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Military Seeks US Back Of Handover Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's military government
today called for "understanding and support" of the United States
and other western countries for its three-year program of
transition to civil rule.
</P>
<P>
"What Nigeria needs is not sanction or isolation, but genuine
understanding and support for the transitional plan," said the
Minister of Federal Capital Territory, Lieutenant General Jerry
Useni, who is the country's No. 3 man.
</P>
<P>
He told a visiting U.S. religious delegation headed by Moslim
leader Louis Farrakhan that Nigeria would enter a democratic era
after 1998.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and some other western countries have imposed limited
sanctions against Nigeria over the detention of former
presidential candidate Moshood Abiola and the execution of nine
Ogoni minority activists.
</P>
<P>
Farrakhan responded: "We saw. We heard. We discussed. And we
will soon make a detailed report of our findings."
</P>
<P>
The Muslim leader urged Nigerians to unite themselves in order
to make a strong and virile nation devoid of ethnic differences
and unnecessary sentiments.
</P>
<P>
Farrakhan and his 30-member delegation left Nigeria today,
ending their fact-finding mission to the west African state.

<HEADLINE> Buthelezi Demands Constitution-Writing Process Be Halted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 13 (Xinhua)-- The constitution-writing
process should be stopped until the promise of international
mediation has been honoured, Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader
Mangosuthu Buthelezi said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during the national assembly debate on President Nelson
Mandela's opening speech of parliament, Buthelezi said trust could
not be built on "the basis of reneguing on signed solemn agreements".
</P>
<P>
"We can only hope to bring about peace and stability in the
country if we are able to build trust between us. To renegue on
solemn agreements is the wrong way of going about the business of
building trust,+ said buthelezi.
</P>
<P>
The IFP withdrew from the constitutional assembly early last
year in protesting against the failure of the African National
Congress (ANC) to honour an agreement, which was reached before
the 1994 general election on the international mediation over
Zulu autonomy in Kwazulu/Natal.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to mandela's call to prohibit the carrying of dangerous
weapons in public, Buthelezi said the government's intervention such
as depriving people of the right to carry traditional weapons at
cultural events and public gatherings would never succeed.
</P>
<P>
"I can assure him (Mandela) that the combined might of the
security forces can never succeed in forcing member of the Zulu
nation from giving away their god-given right to carry their cultural
accoutrements whenever they wish to do so," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Buthelezi said the IFP had no intention of having a
confrontational relationship with the president and supported him in
normalising the situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
He also said there should be issues above the political
differences, such as the issue of violence, on which "we need to
mobilise all our people, regardless of political affiliation, to
declare war on the endemic violence that threatens stability and
peace in our country". enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian defence
headquarters today announced the successful completion of a
training exercise between Nigerian and Cameroonian armed forces
in spite of the recent bloody military clash in the disputed
Bakassi peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The Cameroonian and Nigerian soldiers had a bloody clash on
February 3 in the Bakassi peninsula, resulting in casualties on
both sides. During the clash, Nigeria captured some of the
cameroonian soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The completion of the training, held in Cameroon shortly after
the clash, was announced here by Director of Defence Information
Fred Chijuka.

about five days, was at the invitation of cameroon and aimed at
"promoting good relationship" between countries of west African
sub-region.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the frequent skirmishes in the area to the
unruly behaviour of some of the cameroonian gendarmes.
</P>
<P>
Fred Chijuka however warned that any country "that wants to
create problem for Nigeria would have itself to blame as it will
not get the support from other countries".

<HEADLINE> Omani Minister visits UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Omani Minister of State for
Foreign Affairs Yussef Ben Alawi arrived here today in preparation
for the upcoming Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) foreign ministers
meeting to be held in Saudi capital of Riyadh in March.
</P>
<P>
The Omani official told reporters this evening that Qatar will
attend next GCC foreign ministers meeting, which marks the end of
a crisis between Qatar and other five GCC member states.
</P>
<P>
Alawi arrived here after winding up visits to Qatar, Saudi
Arabia, Bahrain and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
His Gulf tour, starting from February 9, is aimed at mediating
relations between Qatar and other GCC members.
</P>
<P>
The GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman and
the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
Alawi claimed that The dispute over GCC's next secretary-general
has resolved.
</P>
<P>
Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa al Thani walked out of the
closing session of last December's GCC summit in protest against
the appointment of Jamil al Hujeilan, a Saudi Arabian diplomat, as
the next secretary-general of the six-nation alliance.
</P>
<P>
Qatar was said to seek the appointment of a Qatari to the job,
because the emirate has never held the post and the country had
once threatened to boycott all future GCC meetings.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Qatar has agreed Oman's proposal to
change the term of GCC secretary-general to non-renewable three
years instead of the current renewable three-year term.
</P>
<P>
That hints that after Hujeilan's tenure, a Qatari might be the
next secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
Alawi has met with his UAE counterpart Sheikh Hamdan Bin Zayed
al-Nahyan and asked him to convey a verbal message of Sultan
Qaboos of Oman to UAE President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan al Nahyan
on the recent Gulf and Arab situation.

<HEADLINE> Yemen, Eritrea Agree to Resolve Dispute through  International Arbitration: Egyptian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Yemen and Eritrea have agreed to
resolve their dispute over Red Sea islands through international
arbitration, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said here today.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said at a joint meeting of the Arab affairs, foreign
relations and national security committees of the People's
Assembly (parliament) that Yemeni Foreign Minister Abdul Karim
al-Iriyani is expected to visit Egypt soon for talks aimed at
finding a peaceful settlement to the dispute over the islands of
Hanish, claimed by both Yemen and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Eritrean President Isaias Afewerki visited Cairo and
met with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian foreign minister said holding a summit between
Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh and his Eritrean counterpart
Afewerki in Cairo is one of the alternatives currently under
discussion with the aim of settling the dispute.
</P>
<P>
The dispute flared up last December when the two countries had
a fierce battle. The Eritrean troops occupied the island of
Greater Hanish, while the other two islands are still in the hands
of Yemen.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, along with France and Ethiopia, has been trying to
mediate a settlement to the dispute.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that the stability of the Red Sea region is very
important for Egypt's national security.
</P>
<P>
He also called on Sudan to cooperate with the international
community by surrendering the three suspects involved in an
assassination attempt on Mubarak in Addis Ababa last June.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council late last month adopted a resolution
giving Sudan 60 days to extradite the three men. But Sudan has
said that it does not know their whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
In his address, Moussa said that there has been progress in
peace negotiations between Syria and Israel, but it needs time to
reach a final agreement.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel's early elections, to he held in May,
will not prevent the continuation of peace talks.
